Meprandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services

Pension SchemTCls) and *ive &apos;U 11       Lolovers would also

occupational or personal pension to which their e Pj ^ concerned the

contribute.    I h9EBL discussing further wit hased best way of achieving that strategy and we are agr   d       a P implementation proc^K&amp;h is explained below     &quot;  ay be P however,  to remind coHeJfcs firSt  f ^ &quot; essential.

COST OF SERPS

. ff.    , t     gu^- there are some

2-      Projections forward are obvi|^y difficu that the number

estimates on which we can be vi*m y C         &quot;  -e r.- p is-   pensioners  is set to rise subiUfclly-

1985 9.98 million pensione%Ui

2005 10.1 million pensioners

2015 H.l million pensioners

2025 12.3 million pensioners

2035 12.5 million pensioners.

is no doubt,  therefore, that expenditure on pensions i.&gt; set: to rise ^nificantly.    The Qn     question is by how   f&apos;     &quot;Igt Pinflation, the pending is about  15* billion.    Without any allowa&quot;c!: _ raaking

COst of SERPS alone will reach  25 billion a year by 20JJ * ed

Pensions spending  45 billion a year (if basic P?T   i|De by Prices) and  66 billion a year (on earnings).    At tne


Projections by the Government Actuary&apos;s Department shows that the number k      contributors remain about the same.    The ratio of contributors to ^Pensioners therefore worsens:

!985 2:3

V^005 2:2

2015 2:0 2025 i:8

a broaSjB^atic workforce has  to pay for bigger pensions  for more pensioners. ^^^2

10t ^Tne build ^^gg^pending on SERPS is about  to begin.     LI&quot; we do not

       Costs wilB^^CTfease and the contributions of the working Population will^crMyse with them.

^*     Public spending will be pre-empted - at a time when demands from

e elderly will mean more pressure for spending on the health service and personal social services.    There will be consequences for all other programmes.

Ihere wiLL be no imprimM^^ in personal  occupational pension L ver.    xhe trend to more peiBtf^benefits provided by the State will continue.

thatCthe1USi n in the Ministerial Gro^^^^ocial Security (MISC 111) was object-    cost of SERPS was unacceptable^^^t we also saw a wider job;   lnl&apos;&apos;&apos;   to !&apos;IVI&apos; everybody the right tcJra^: own pension through (heir through tto.&quot;^ve People a personal stake l^^H^economy and their future their own pension investments. ^

REPLACING SERFS

a requir Pr posal agreed in MISC 111 was that SERPS should be replaced by en&gt;ployer at least a minimum level of contribution by both

^ne focus emp-&apos;-0yees to an occupational or personal ^^ion scheme,

chan&amp;p v    ln Subsequent discussions has been on how to carry through the to Private pensions for all. ^fiiW

re are  two main  issues: , ?&apos;^&apos;^

0Cc       ere  Ls  the short-term impact   oi  a major extensio! ^unded the      .lonal and personal pension provision while the liJftiJJFjjes of beforXlSt^n? Pay~as-you-go National  Insurance system conti^^J^ ii,,,   &apos; &quot;    1,1 1 s musl  have an imparl: on employers anti employee sVAnSkin lie and private sectors.    But we have concluded that ^e^JL


effect - which is shared between employment costs,  the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) and take-home pay - can be reduced to acceptable levels by phasing in the new arrangements over three years.    This will allow sufficient time both for contributors and the financial institutions to adapt to the changed financial flows.

^       We need to take account of the impact of the change in the Pension expectations of those retiring in the coming years. This could be considerable for those now in their fifties who would not have time to build up their own pension sufficiently to replace the

&amp;RPS entitlement they might be expecting.    For the younger age groups^J:his is not a problem:    even at the minimum contribution ^evel (4 per cent), they should be able to achieve a reasonable level

pension entitlement from their own investment.    We have concluded that the best way to proceed will be to allow older workers to remain *n SERPs^j^p^i retirement.    This will require a system of age-related

a lonal ^puMnce contributions to be  Introduced but  it will ensure SERp n boc^^j^^-ng this century would be affected by the ending of

summary, my IHJI^I could be put into effect as follows:

&apos;&apos;       for men aged ^roT over and women aged 45 or over, SERPS would continue until their retirement;

b. f

h*      ror all other employees SERPS would be replaced over three years a minimum private pension j^quirement.    This would involve:

preservation of a^V^fcPS rights earned up to 1987;

ix-    reduced rates of accW^pef additional SERPS rights in

1987- 88 and 1988-89; and ncMe*SERPS rights thereafter;

ll  a minimum private pension contribution by employers and employees of 1 per cent each in 1987-88;  1.5 per cent in

1988- 89;  and 2 per cent in 1989-^^k

nigtchNatl0nal Insurance contribution ratq^^^bld be changed to

all those under 50 who would no longer be in SERPS would Pay a standard contribution rate of 16.45 per cent (shared

etween employers and employees) in 1989-90 wj*kno contracted-out rebate following a phased chA ^[tom the current combined rate of 19.45

5o&apos;l  th Se remaining in  the SERPS  (ie  the contr^j^^i over .Us) would pay a combined rate of 20.45 per cent %mfM87-88 instead of 19.45 per cent at present;


iii.  those over 50 currently contracted-out would pay a combined k rate of 16.45 per cent in 1989-90 following a phased change from

P the current 19.45 per cent combined rate less the contracted-out

flk rebate of 6.25 per cent on relevant earnings;

^,,~jt*gures assume that the self-employed would not be affected by the

7&apos;    ^gjt implications.    The phasing out of SERPS in this way will:

a      Lessen the initial impact of the change.    In the first year the p6t efJ(fct would De to increase the PSBR by  100 million.    An extra

uiiJlion of pensions investment would be generated but this would mean^^^rage a net increase of only 0.3 per cent  in private sector empl0yi^^^mpSts and a net reduction in take-home pay (alter paying Pens ion^jSpiy&gt;ut ions) of only 0.2 per cent.    Even at   the end of the transition^ j^riod in 1989-90 the net effects are manageable: tin-total addiW^^^pensions  investment: would be   1.3 hi II ion and the pSBR would b^JJIeased by  0.6 billion  in 1989-90.    The net effecl over the three year period would be an increase of only 0.2 per cent *n Private sect^^m^^oyment costs and an average reduction in take-home pay of%.^ r cent.

D&quot;     Still secure almost all the possible long-term public expenditure savings.    Compared with an unphased abolition of SERPS, Proposal means foregoing savings which would have risen to about j-llion by the turn of the^entury.    But thereafter the savings rise to over  22 billion i^ftp-34.

8.    The im r ^JP^d^

years ^-BiLLications for individuals are as  follows.    Those within fifteen expPcta|_ .retlrment - the age group^j^^j^ncerned about their pension Private l0ns.~ will be unaffected.    E^pi^e younger age groups the move to minimum Provisi n should not pose any^^^^s problems.    Even at the Perfor     evel of contribution and on caWKJm forecasts of investment SgRpg     r,06&apos;  tne expected pension offers ^FiMKonable comparison with choose t e.must also expect that a substan^H^^^roportion of people will pr Mem f Invest more than the minimum.    Non^th^ess,  there could be a have in     r.those just below the age limit foj^K^ining in SERPS who will consider&quot;    Icient time to build up extra pension provision.    I shall be Meliorated further how the cliff-edge effect of the age limit can be

THE NEW SYSTEM ^

principieaPPr ach to pensions put  forward   in C(85) 9 is&apos;ft^Lon the the State- f tw^n Pillars;  basic   flat-rale provision to oP|me through

and       additional provision to be made by the  individuaj^^umjugh his everybody t, 0wn. Saviugs.    It  is an approach which not only s^^^to give e right to their own pension but also offers the individual


much greater involvement and much greater choice in hispension |  arrangements.    We are currently legislating to give members ^occupational pension schemes fairer treatment:

a.      the right to a transfer value when leaving a job;

yV.     preserved rights for early leavers;

^T.     better information for scheme members.

We have shown our commitment to the concept of personal pens^ ^they  ould be much easier to operate without the ^   1 u   ei  not

Pensi0ns stature.    To carry the process further is difficult it -possiblJfk the present SERPS structure.    The prop       si have outlined will enable us to achieve our strategy while J in

taring retirement age.    They will meet our b&quot;l8atl0*UV0 the change SERPS.    They wUl allow employers and employees to adjust to the change  ver a reasonafSiiod, and they will enable us to stimulate the c-ati0n of indljSLde schemes for those indusries i maY be reluctant wVJLup their own schemes.    The new r minimum requirements will show that we have put in place an entire y &quot;edible and effective replacement for SERPS which offers virtually everyone the assurancFofJ^eir own occupational pension.

10-    i invite colleagues to endorse my proposals.
