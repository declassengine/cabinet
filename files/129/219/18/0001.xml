(^ROPOSALS FOR EXPENDITURE TOTALS

   control of public spending is central to our economic strategy, and^essential if we are to maintain any prospect of red&quot;&quot;ng the tax

Our discussion at Chequers of public spending priorities c&lt;^ted on the basis of this  fundamental premise.

8-     For llEkthe baseline uplift  for individual programmes of^J P   nt was deliberately set somewhat below the expected rate of  &quot;-tlf ^low a margiSBKe adjustment of priorities between prog      Propose we LwfrJlthat the aggregate planning total for that year should rise by ^Qfcnt above the level of the preceding yearn with the Medium Term Financial Strategy assumption for the rate of inflation in 1988-89.    This gives planning totals of:

	t         billion	

1986-87	1987-88	1988-89

139. 1	143.9	148.2

^ starting with 1985-86, to  5 billion,   6 billion ? ^

^Pectively.    Now we are rolling the P-C-Su &quot;^coming the first Wn^h the present Reserve provision is  6 billion;

v, r.fvthe  5 billion J1&apos;    U is too soon to say with confidence how much      *J ^

*es*rve for 1985.86 wiU be spent.    But it is f &quot;fy       t       to limit h P^ for significant underspending; and that we must cont^Tl access to cases where it is quite unavoidable. djfV

^PECIAL SALES OF ASSETS

13.   Successful completion of the enlarge   P f for gpecial

now envisage should mean that the existing p knowing precisely

VJLof assets are exceeded, bu   we are and depends on

by how much.    The timing of sales is sui control.    But I propose

market conditions and other factors outside ou and  3i billion

we should assume sales totalling  4* billion, t   ver the three years of the Survey.

w foH that receipts from privatisation and

WhileAave always accepted that receip

RUNNING COSTS AND MANPOWER

themselves must continue to be a vital objective       h for

-federation of British Industry have  g gb to the Survey. ^e Eirst time running costs are fully their running costs

Departments were asked to propose cash target(h  0Ver the three Survey years against the backgWund of our ai ^ f  &quot;th in these costs in aggregate should be held * per ce    wed level of inflation in each of the three years     On       P ^ ^ DePartments were asked to examine the scope for further s       8 the Pr Pose an indicative planning total for 1 April 1989,   est published manpower targets. ^^R^d^.


The provision sought for running costs by Departments compared with the targets proposed, is:

	1986-87	1987-88	1988-89

%&gt;^k Provision sought by ^^JbP e P a r tme n t s Assumed Gross Domestic Product deflator less i Per cent	+ 6.3%	+ 3.0%	+ 2.5%

	+ 4.0%	+ 3.0%	+ 2.5%

u     The overall increase of 6.3 per

18. The deflfcls are set out in Annex B.    ine ^ year figures

cent in 1986-87 proposed is unacceptably hign, forward first year

will only Vmain .satisfactory if we are able to carry reductions flPaVQie later years.

19. The manpojQi^ &quot; which, clearly   are ^J^^^SS.04 the running costs bids - are also set out at Annex       ^ &amp; substantial 1988 and 1989 areTj^r tably large, given  _      for savingS wherever contingency margin,  and the Treasury wlll^lOO      g costs Possible as part of l^sfrutiny of Departm.

20- Discussions at official level are alr&quot;d^r^igrionnwnerever possible, tuning costs figures, to seek reductlo&quot;S       ^ ar2ets for each Department.

to reach agreement on tough but realis tic       ^ Minigter.s H June ln the Light of the conclusion &quot;Jked at tne      officials to look

So l P    P year&apos;^Qfcey. now that there will be no &quot;clawback&quot; exercise dv


^    SURPLUS LAND AND EMPTY HOUSING

     We have already set  in hand action  to make a success o   our surplus and empty housing initiative.    This depends on Departments drawing up ^^RKistic plans  to dispose of almost all  of their present surplus holdings V J?e end of 1987-88.    I look, to colleagues for their full co-operation ^^W^eeing taut targets for disposal in the Survey.

CONCLUSION

24     T  

invite colleagues to agree:

a&quot;    lf^^^C exPen&lt;liture planning totals  of  139.] billion,

 143.9 billion and  148.2 billion respectively for the three years

1986-87 to 1988-89;

k*      ReS6I^^^^^L^^ Million,   6 billion and  7 billion respectively

c-      that we am^^L adopt the approach to the targets for running costs, manpower, surplus land and empty housing set out in Paragraphs 16-23^bom:

d*     that I should report back to the Cabinet in early autumn when I

ave completed discussions with colleagues on their individual public expenditure programmes, and on their targets as in c. above.
