the armed forcSg^members of the judiciary. I this note a summa^CJ their recommendations.

2.     The Review Bod^^U clear that on this occasion^J^tAr not simply to updateVaJkrates by *e er* &quot;       ive review, including last report a yLr ago.^o conduct a co&apos;ehensive^ ^ ^ ^ n t only a major re-examination of salar underlying pay

service and the armed forces but also a review of the

structure in the senior civil service and an extensive judicial salary structure.  ^

!:     For senior civil servants the toview       y  .iitroducing into the pay changes in the salary structure with a vie&quot;       f flexibility to take arrangements at  these levels a gre^Jg||  f  , b weiKht    and of other fcount of differences of performance c|or j _arket for particular Eactors such as,   for example,  the *ta*&amp; tZ/d appointments.    m pari Lcular they have ^pfcerme .

4:     In formulating their recommendations on salary        ^M^idence 011 ClVl]  servants,  the Review Body have taken into con^e ^g^ble for recruitment, retention, motivation and morale, e&quot;w lk70L. They

Phe Ple in jobs of comparable responsibility in other walk   J^jjL&amp;

also taken into account the importance of be ng able an ^sonable career structure,   in terms of salary    in orde  J|^n !je^ate supply of people of the right quality to fill Che Public service.


^&apos;     These considerations have led the Review Body to recommend a widening k     differentials for the senior civil service which would entail %    stantial increases of remuneration at the top levels, though it would 1 leave those levels well below the salary levels of people at ^Parable levels and with broadly comparable responsibilities in the WPWte sector.

^milar considerations have been taken into account in arriving at .   mmendations for senior members of the armed forces and the judiciary, h broadly similar results.

for   ^8 ^ev^ew Body do not recommend any changes in the salary structure

senion ^R^.cers of the armed  forces.    They do,  however,   invite the rear emen^BJjie armed forces to consider whether some similar ci    yan^em^HI^^that recommended for the salary structure  in the senior &apos;ore    Servic^^^2^be helpful   in the different   context   of the armed

st     ^ne Review Body recommend a revised and somewhat simplified salary Sa,Ucture for the judiciary.    The Lord Chancellor considers that the y structure Pr ^W^is sensible, and should be adopted.

C v^ lncrease the pay bill in a full year by 12.2 per cent for senior and h Servants&gt; by 17.6 per cent for senior members of the armed forces v 16.3 per cent for the judiciary.

10. Th    d  

of Min-6    rime Minister has disc^M^l these recommendations with a group the rv,1SterS directly concerned (the Lord President,  the Lord Chancellor, i      &apos;,ance 1 1 or of the Kxchequer,^K^^cretary of State for Defence and B0(j   hanceHor of the Duchy of Lah^.    They consider that   tin- Review caree   ^&amp; mac&apos;e a g od case for enabFM^^e public service to provide a and wi  Pay structure which will attra^^^^retain people of high qua I Lty, remun 1Ch.offers to the most able the prospect of attaining levels of avail Luat &apos;  n which,  while not matching tlJ^JAhest levels of remuneration fair ^u e ln the private sector, provide rewards which can be regarded as and o *     not Senerous by outside s tandards^^i^n these considerations, Bodies        ^e ^act  that  the  recommendations oi^^^ other three Review Review r3^!3^ &apos;)een accepted, the Ministers concerned propose that the Salarv         S recommendations both as to salary structures and as to  &apos; &quot;&apos;Pie     eveisj should be accepted in principle, but that their &quot;Station should be staged.

11     Th #^

l985-86 Ugl1 tlley a8ree that the cost of whatever increases are agreed for Cash i; ^&apos;10uld be absorbed in existing public expenditTfj^^Aovisions and CorisidemiU f r the year&gt;  Lt 18 political rather than fi^BP^l whiCb   ratlor&gt;s that constitute the main reason for s taging^Sipfc| increases Cons i dr.&apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos; 1 &apos; C&quot; &apos;&apos;&quot; &apos; y at the higher  levels, are substantial. WinPsters have sPread6^e^ 3 Variety of options for staging.    It would be possible^ to embarrag&apos;np^emeril:al:ion  ver two years, or even more; but the ml^tjjlitical that is ^ment is likely to arise from the total increases recomraeuded, and ^ n8 the 1    .    to be concentrated at   the I Lme of the announcemeniT^J^OT^ver Period over which implementation   is staged.     If implementJh:^J^.s


aged over more than one year any increases paid after 1 April 1986 would

fably have to be &quot;dynamised&quot; by whatever further increases the Review xght then recommend;  this could lead to a succession of ortably large figures in later years, which could themselves be cally difficult at a time when such difficulty might be less readily than this year.    The Ministers concerned therefore judge that on e it would be preferable to complete the implementation by stages - the current financial year.

12

Other relevant considerations are:

a.     The staging should not be more generous than that agreed for the lnCrt l recommended by the Nurses and Midwives Review Body  (5 per cent^Jlm^a April 1985,  the balance,  averaging h per cent,  from 1 Februai^ra^).

b-      The ^jl of the increases for 1985-86 should not  (in the case  f the senM*^^^il servants and senior officers) be seriously out of line with th^^^^fcints of the increases already agreed for lower grades and rai^R^^^the civil service and the regular armed services v4.9 and 7.1 per cent respectively).

c-      Given the dec^^on,  announced by the Prime Minister a year ago, that in future superannuation entitlements for public servants should always be based on salaries actually in payment at or immediately

e  re the date of retirement, and not on some notional salary level, the decisions on staging these increases will significantly affect

ie superannuation benef itsv^raenior officers oi  the regular armed

 rces and members of the judiciary who retire between 1 April 1985 and the date when the Review Body&apos;s recommendations come into full

ect,  and the superannuationk^r^g^its of senior civil servants who retire between 1 April 1985 andi^ip^M twelve months after the Review

oty s recommendations come into^fc^Aeffeet.

Propos&quot;n t*16 ^ nt of all these considerations the Ministers concerned implp 6 t&apos;1at the increases recommended by ^B^Jpview Body should be from  ented in two stages, the first payabl^Tr^^l July 1985, the second f0r  .. March 1986.    They consider that the cho^^^is between three options between ribut:&quot;&quot;n8 the implementation as between the two stages.    The choice amount11 t^ese options depends on a balance between two considerations: the increas ^ &apos;&quot;^ avera8e increase in 1985-86 and its relationship to the Parag   6S ^or l wer grades and ranks in the civil and armed services (cf.

and the effect upon superannuation entitlements of those lng between 1 July 1985 and 28 February 1986. ^^^^


14.    The three options are:

Average increase in 1985-86 for

		HCS 7	AF % 7.3	Judiciary %

W 1.	50 per cent of increases recommended* from 1 July 1985, 50 percent from 1 ^rch 1986	5.1		7.1

2.	75tfi^%cent of In^jf&gt;% recommended&quot; from ^jily 1985, 25 per cS^JJ^m 1 March 1986	7.4	10.3	9.5

3.	Re c omme n d emmiy less 5 percantajL points* from ^FuTy 1985, balance from 1 March 1986	6.5	9.9	9.5

The resulting salaries axe shown at Annex B. *   with a minimum increase: &apos;ed 5 per cent in each case

DRAFT OF 16 JULY 1985

QUESTION: To ask the Prime Minister, whether she has recei^^he latest report of the Top Salaries Review Body and whether she will make a statement.

DRAFT ANSWER^Fm

Report No 22^the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) which recommends new salary rates as from 1 April 1985 for senior civil servants, senior officers of the armed forces, and members of t^^idiciary,  is being laid before Parliament as a Corm^&amp;^aper this afternoon. Copies will be available in ^^Jjete office.

2-      The Review Body have on this^^fcion undertaken a comprehensive review not only of the^alary levels of

groups concerned but also of the salary structures. xt is for this reason that the Review Body &apos;report has, b*~ agreement with the Government, been delM^rather longer after the date to which the recommenda%j^^ relate  (l April 1985 )  than usual.    I should likl^Q^it on record the Government&apos;s gratitude to the ChairrilM^ th  other members of the Review Body for the care anf^


thoroughness with which their conclusions and krecommendations have been prepared.

3.      For senior civil servants the Review Body have recommended certain changes in the salary structure with a view | introducing into the pay arrangements at these levelftgkeater degree of flexibility to take account of diff^JP ^5 of performance and of  job weight, and of other factS^^ich as,  for example,  the state of the market for pa^^lar appointments.    In particular, they have recommended^^^^

- a greater degree of salary differentiation in Grade 1 (Permane^ftecretaries) by reference to broad consideratio^^k job weight;

- the introduction of incremental scales, including some discretionary increm^^^o be awarded for high performance,  for Grade^and 3  (Deputy and Under Secretaries and equivalents);

- the cessation of London weighting ^fi^de 3&quot;

4-      In formulating their recommendations on salary levels for senior civil servants,  the Review Body \ taken into consideration such evidence as they have^bj^


able to gather on recruitment, retention, motivation and ^morale, and rewards available at comparable levels of ^sponsibility in other walks of life.    They have also taken into account the importance of being able to offer a reasonable career structure,  in terms of salary, in ordei^#kachieve an adequate supply of people of the rightMj^y to fill the top posts in the public serviceT^iir consideration of these matters has led the Review*Ato recommend a widening of differentials for the senior civil service which would entail substantial inc^fts of remuneration at the top levels, though it would still leave those levels well below the salary levels of people at comparable levels and with broadly comparable responsibilities in the private sector.

5.    Similar considerations hatHL^ taken into account in arriving at recommendations ^J|ior members of the armed forces and the judiciary, wiThbroadly similar results.

6- The Review Body have also recommendelK^ain changes in the salary structure of the judic%^^

7- The new salary structures and levels recommM^ the Review Body would increase the pay bill in a f^-j^


year by 12.2 per cent for senior civil servants, by 17.6 ^per cent for senior members of the armed forces and by ^^.3 per cent for the judiciary.

8.     The Government accepts the view of the Review Body that|#ks of great importance for the health of the public service in this country that it should offer a career^Aructure which will attract and retain people ofjAlgh quality which that service requires and deserves^Lffers to the most able the prospect of being able e^^^ally to attain levels of remuneration which, while not matching the highest levels of remuneration available in the private sector, Provide rewards which regarded not only by

themselves but also by P^Wnt and the pUbUC 33 ^ but not generous in r elat io\JL^he responsibilities

carried.

9-     We therefore accept the Review Body&apos;s recommendations in principle, both as to salary structures and as to salary levels.    But tj^amounts involved are so considerable that we feel bound to implement the salary increases recommended  ^se groups,  by stages,  as has been done on other oT^ftons in the past.    Accordingly the groups concerned W*W^L receive [half of the salary increases recommended]


a minimum of 5 per cent) with effect from 1 July 1985 J^and the balance with effect from 1 March 1986. ^is proposed that London weighting for Grade 3 and equivalent in the civil service should be withdrawn as to 50 per cent from 1 July 1985 and completely from 1 March^^.    These decisions will result in average increases for the financial year 1985/86 of [5.1] per cent for^^^r civil servants,   [7.3] per cent for senior memb^Af the armed forces and [7.1] per cent for the judic186lL The cost of these increases in 1985/86 will be Jhtbed in existing public expenditure Provisions and cash limits.    I am circulating a note of the rates of pay resultino^from these decisions as an

&quot;lh&quot; *&quot;&quot;&quot; \

10.    The Review Body proposeVS^the system of discretionary increments for high performance recommended for senior civil ser^^n Grades 2 and 3 should be introduced with effect from 1 April 1986. We shall give further consideration to this proposal, and to the arrangements for assessment, appraijj^and review,  on which such a system will dependT^J^t is realistically and fairly to reward high perfoY^^p and to take account of cases in which high performan^^ n t sustained,  and I shall make a further statemen*^^ this aspect of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations in d^ course.


U.    In accordance with the principle which was set out ^in my reply to a Question by the Hon Member for Leeds ^|st on 13 April 1984, the superannuation entitlements

of members of the groups in question will continue to be

based on levels of salary actually in payment at or in

the P^J^d before the date of retirement.
