ECONOMIC STRATEGY

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

We approachTBS^get with the economy in reasonably good shape, despite the miners&apos;  st^fcelfollowing another year of low inflation and steady growth.    But, 3fiifc]2fcake of the recent pressure on sterling,  this is not a time to take any risks; but with unemployment still remaining stubbornly high I believe that, within the constraints of prudence, the focus this year should be on a lB|^^for jobs.

ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

2. 1984 was a good year for the world economy - the best since 1976 for output and trade.    But with the return to a more normal growth rate in the United States 1985 is unlikely to be as good.    Nevertheless, output growth in the major  Industrialised court should average 3 per cent or so, wi-th inflation staying below 5 p^jbcjfet.

3. The United Kingdom economy hat benefited from a strong rise in exports and 1985 should see further ifwB, broadly m line with world trade.    Last year we saw a sharp rise%fclfeestment, especially in manufacturing    and further substantialities are expected this year. With personal real   incomes also continuinQgrise,  there is scope for consumer spending to rise by 2-3 per cent ^W^^*

*.     The economy has withstood the coal strika^^er than might have been expected.    Nevertheless, the strike is calculated to have reduced output growth by 1 per cent in 1984:    without it the economy could well have i^own~by 3i per cent.    On the assumption that the strike is over soon, growth for 1985 should be over 3 per cent.    However, North Sea oil Production, which has been contributing nearly i per cejka year recently L  the growth of total output,   is now probably at or r^m^s peak.

It   looks as  though the balance of payments on curre^Rgount was in small surplus  in 1984, despite the extra oil imports resulMFJrom the cOal strike.    Once that is over,   the current account should*^*  to more substantial surplus for a time.    Looking further ahead, the I^^^tall


m the oil surplus will be partly offset by extra income from our k increases stock of overseas assets.    But there will be a continued need to mimprove our performance if British industry is to be competitive in world 2Krkets and at home.

\^ ^Inflation has been running at around 5 per cent for the last two ye^m but the recent  fall  in the exchange rate, coupled with the effecl ow mortgage rates of the sharp rise in interest rates, will inevitably mean a modest increase in the Retail Price Index in the first half of 1985.    However, with a gradual improvement in financial markets, and a steadier pound, the inflation rate should be falling again before the end of 1985 andjuito 1986.

7.      TherSm^kwo principal external worries.    First,  the United States budget defiadW^^nains a major uncertainty for world economic prospects and for finan^pSifc^rkets generally,    whilst the extent of the United States Adminis t it n&apos; s proposed action suggests  the problems will remain for some years ahead.    Second, with the prospect of plentiful oil supplies,  future ^Vj^ces also remain uncertain;  a sharp fall  in oil prices, or in the dollar, would pose a threat to our balance of payments and reduce tax reven^P^l^r the coming year.

At home, despite f^rryears of continued recovery, the high and still rising level of unemployment also remains a major source of worry. The growth in output has been accompanied, as we always expected, by some increase in employment; but with wage increases staying well ahead of prices - to a greater extent than j^arly all our competitors - progress towards  lower unemployment has ljeMwlower than we would like.    We must continue to do all we can to gee; this message across.

9-      Annex I sets out some of the lM^a|Kures from the  forecast. Those f r this year are based on early for 3s^; a further and firmer forecast will be published as usual at Budget nlfce^L

THE MEDIUM TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGY ^QfW

Last year, colleagues agreed that the i^di^L Term Financial Strategy (MTFS) should, exceptionally, be extended to J^^^89.    The figures assumed that public spending in the years beyond the Survey would be held constant at the 1986-87 level published in last year&apos;s White Paper.    I see no reason for any further extension this year.

In the Autumn Statement the published forecast of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement  (PSBR) outturn for  this year was P^PIj^L  8i biiiionj   1^/4 billion more than the figure anticipate^^r^mhe time of the Budget.    This forecast assumed thai   the coal strike, to^dar^^the overrun is mostly attributable, would be over by the end of December.

**     At this stage of the year, the PSBR   outturn is always difficult to orecast with any accuracy; as the difference between revenue ancr^^ ^ exPenditure flows  is approaching  200 billion,  small changes on eithj^^^


I    side can have a significant effect on the net outcome.    But, with the coal WL strike continuing and with other very serious pressures on the public L^pxpenditure planning total, there is a real prospect that this year&apos;s PSBR

will be substantially higher than that envisaged at the time of the Autumn

Statement.

]J^^%his  is  the second year running in which,  largely because of unforeseen events, the PSBR has exceed expectations.    That is disappointing enough.    But it must also be seen against the background of market doubts both at home and abroad about our determination to maintain downward pressure on inflation.    It is all the more essential, therefore, that our fi^fcl stance next year should be seen to reinforce the thrust of policy generally.    This means, in my view, that we should aim to get back to the p a tnf^^dkbor rowing set out in last year&apos;s MTFS, which envisaged a PSBR of 2 per Qent of Gross Domestic Product.

FISCAL POSITIOI^^

&apos; 4.    As the resul^^aj^e decisions we took in this year&apos;s public spending round, my room for manoeuvre in the Budget seems unlikely to be very large. V&gt;\

15.    In the Autumn Statment I referred to the possibility of being able to make some tax reductions this year, on top of the  lxx billion tax cuts which come through in 1985-86 as the result of measures included in last year&apos;s Budget.    The autumn forecast put the prospective &quot;fiscal a&lt;*justment&quot;, on the usual illustr^^/e assumptions, at about  li billion -subj

ect to the usual wide margiAB[ rror at that stage.    That figure was over and above broad indexation ^ftj^excise duties and the  Income tax thresholds and bands,  the e f f ec t s ^^^3p.ch are illustrated in Annex 2.

I have to say that the latest fofccapts imply even less room for manoeuvre.    On the receipts side,  as the result of changes in oil prices and in the dollar exchange rate,  it see^sjj^ly now that oil revenues may

e somewhat greater next year than had been forecast  in the autumn. But there are already  indications of even strolE|^Dward pressures on public sPending next year.    I have already referrec^toJ| e continuation of the coal strike which - even if it ended tomorrow^^Jould still cast its shadow into the coming financial year; and other demand-led claims on the

eserve are already in prospect for 1985-86.    Moreover, higher domestic lnterest rates are bound to increase the total debt interest.

^7.    in short,   L now envisage having only modest scope^^^^any new measures in the Budget, after providing for indexatior^^p^^s makes it all e more important to focus on measures which will  increase the underlying lciency of the economy,  and which will be seen as encolrlM^ greater ^mPloyment an^ as  improving the prospects for bringing down^mejpployment. way of background, Annex 3 shows how the various taxes ha\^M^d in


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

\l8. in spite of the miners&apos; strike, the economy has come through the last l^kar reasonably well,  and there are no signs of the recovery faltering.

But recent weeks have underlined the importance of the strong dollar and ^^l^^tain oil prices, and reaffirmed the need to maintain confidence in o^^mmitment to the defeat of inflation and to policies which will bring t^it about.    To that end, we must do everything possible to keep within our public spending plans, and to bring the level of public borrowing back on to the downward path charted in the MTFS.    Therein lies the only secure route to continuing non-inflationary growth, higher employment and an eventual en^o rising unemployment.

19.    Accor^l^^ I seek colleagues&apos; views on the appropriate Level of the PSBR for 1985-86 (paragraph 12), and on the broad shape of a Budget with an employment%5i|^ (paragraph 17).

3. These figures reflect the rise in the employees&apos; NIC rate from 6% to 9%. So far as income tax is concerned, personal allowances have increased 16% in real terms since 1978-79 and have roughly kept pace with earnings. The basic rate has been reduced from 33P to 30P, but the 25P reduced rate band has been abolished.

4. As  the  table  shows,   indexation of  allowances  in the Budget  ould lead to   a   very   slight   rise   in   the   proportion  of incomes taken   in   tax   and   NIC.     This   is   because   earnings   are assumed to rise by 7% compared with the indexation percentage of 4.6%.
