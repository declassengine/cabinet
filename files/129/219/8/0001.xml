CHAPTER ONE: THE STRATEGIC CONTEXT Forty Years r&gt;f Peace

101. Forty years ago the Second World War ended.   Like its precursor it W begun in Europe but engulfed the world, leaving some 50 million dead.

In its closing phase, in June 1945, representatives of 50 nations signed the &quot;nited Nations Charter in San Francisco, and the world hoped that it had at last learnt how to keep the peace.   But within four years, the nations of Western Europe found themselves faced by a threat that necessitated more sPecific protection than was afforded by the UN Charter.

102. The sad legacy of the war was that it left Europe divided.   The iron ^rtain that descended over the Continent in the late 1940s was not of the West&apos;s making; for at the close of the war there existed in Europe and America a substantial fund of goodwill towards the Soviet Union, an allied power ^ich had suffered great devastation and lost 20 million dead.   Yet the S viet Union did not reciprocate our goodwill, turning down, for example,

^e generous offer of United States aid under the Marshall Plan and choosing ^tead to consolidate and extend its power in Eastern Europe.   Whereas at th* war&apos;s end the Western democracies rapidly demobilised, and the United ^ates was intent on withdrawing from Europe, the Soviet Union retained over 6 -Ulion men on a wartime footing and determined to establish itself perma-ne*tly in all the countries over which the Red Army had advanced. Between 19*5 and 1948, more than 88 million Eastern Europeans came under Soviet ^nation, including 18 million in the Eastern half of a divided Germany; Soviet Union acquired some 180,000 square miles of territory and

presided over the installation of compliant regimes in every East European capital.   The Berlin blockade was a clear manifestation of the threat posed to Western Europe.    As a result, in 1949 Britain and nine other European countries, together with the United States and Canada, signed the North Atlantic Treaty and laid the foundation for the peace and freedom that we have now enjoyed for more than three and a half decades.

103.   The European scene has changed significantly since that time. I*1 Western Europe, democracy and stability - the ultimate foundations of peace have taken root again and flourished.   Our economies, despite their current problems, have grown substantially; and living standards have risen beyond recognition.   The great overseas empires of the European powers have ended, a change that tripled the number of states in the world in a few decades. Above all, the rivalries that had bedevilled Western Europe since the advent of the nation state and caused the two world wars have been buried. Instead we have forged a new unity.   The countries of Western Europe have drawn together ever more closely, through the network of treaties and groupings established after the war.   The Council of Europe, the European Communities and the European Free Trade Association have transformed the political and economic face of Europe.    In defence, there has been a degree of internatio

 f f-Vip North

cooperation that is unprecedented in history, with the creation or cne Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in partnership with our North American allies, and the establishment of the specifically European groupings: the Western European Union, the Independent European Programme Group and the Eurogroup.   The Government firmly believes that we must now build on that achievement, going forward together to meet challenges to our security  n whatever scale they may arise.

10*.     Chapter 3 p. describe the steps being tahen to strengthen the &quot;European Pillar&quot; of the North Atlantic Alliance, a measure that we halleve * be ta the interests or NATO as a whole.   This is not to finish or belittle    ties with our North American allies which, for historical and cnltnral -sons, will always be especially close.   Nor is it to suggest that Western

intervened in wars that began in this continent, and the OS interest in,   cogent to, a free Western Europe regain as important as they have -  been.   ,ut in this year of coloration in Europe it is fitting that   Shoul, consider with our European allies how we eight draw still -ore

together, and develop a .ore cohesive and distinctive European approach the f k of, and as a contribution to, the North Atlantic Alliance.

^Challenge for NATO

The impact of the original Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe has Stably faded over the years.   Despite the readers of Soviet readiness &quot;  . force in East Oeraany, Hungary, Chechoslovakia and, ..t recently, &quot;listen, the threat  ay see. Teas pressing to those who have no personal - t- of the events of the 1940s.   And yet it regains.   The roots of    .  Policy are complex.   The Soviet Onion inherited the product of .any

of Eussian expansion; it is a country obsessed with its own security k- insensitive to the-security concerns of others.   These traditions, and &quot;  Ereat i porta ce given to military power that goes with the., have been

with an ideology dedicated to the ultimate victory of co^unie.. ^ evidence 3uggests that these ideological goals will be pursued with &quot;&quot;&quot;on and Oration, hut that opportunities will be grasped if the price


is limited and acceptable.   Given the present scale of NATO&apos;s defences, we have no reason to believe that Soviet leaders have any immediate intention of attacking NATO countries; but we cannot ignore the fact that those same leaders continue to improve the Soviet capability for such an attack. More over, the size and reach of the Warsaw Pact&apos;s forces make them a potent political weapon.   If they were not counter-balanced by an adequate militar^ capability, they could be exploited to bring unwelcome influence to bear on the domestic and foreign policies of other countries.

106.   This process has been demonstrated in many parts of the Third World,

to which the Soviet Union increasingly turned its attention when it found

further westward expansion blocked by the political, military and economic

strength of the NATO countries.   Even during the period of &quot;detente&quot; i*1 tne

1970s, the Soviet Union established a dominant position in South Yemen and

Mozambique; undertook proxy interventions in Angola and Ethiopia; helped

Vietnamese communists to overrun and occupy first the south of their count

The

and then Cambodia; and, finally, intervened directly in Afghanistan.

Soviet Union continues to make use of other techniques for extending its

influence worldwide, including the development of the Soviet Navy from a

f forms

coastal to a blue-water force; massive arms exports; and more coven

a to help

of material and political support for groups or governments prepared

further Soviet aims.   NATO has acknowledged that developments beyond the

NATO area may threaten our vital interests and that Alliance members need,

r a wider

therefore, increasingly to look to Western security concerns over  

b th

field than before.   The various measures that the United Kingdom takes,


to counter olrect thr..t. an, to promote stability in countries outside the

area, are discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and * and in the essay on Page[ ].

m.   The balance of forces, both in Europe and worldwide, has changed

US alius already had far larger conventional forces than the West in Europe; &lt;  the United States had first a monopoly and later a marked snpariority in -Clear weapons.   Since then the Soviet Union has not only maintained its Vantage in conventional forces in Europe, bnt has caught up with the United States in Ut.rcontin.ntal strategic nuclear forces and established a clear priority in both longer- and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces. *  as retained, and continues to develop, a massive chemical warfare capacity. a8 notad above, it has acuired a Kavy capable of projecting P  er worldwide.   At the seme time, the Soviet Union has increasingly matched *  *.  in the technical sophistication of its weapons.   Moreover, great attention has been paid to offensive weapons such as tanhs and artillery, in * * the Warsaw Pact now has an advantage of two and a half to one over

and Soviet military doctrine lays primary emphasis on offensive opera-Annex A considers the current balance of forc.s between East and &quot; t in detail.

Since the mld-1970s there has been a decline in the rate of growth of

S-let defenne expenditure, coinciding broadly with a similar slowing-down in

Sovut economy as a whole.   But the scale of current investment in defence

r&gt;   uo the ereat economic 18 &quot;HI extremely high and growing in real terms.   Despite gr

&apos;-&apos;&quot;ices involved for the Soviet people in the present level of defence


spending, the evidence indicates that the military will continue to be given a very high priority by the Soviet leadership.   Even if there were no increase in Soviet defence expenditure, the present massive allocation to defence would ensure sufficient resources for the procurement of large quantities of new military equipment.

109.   That is why there is no room for complacency and why we must constantly be ready to respond to any threat that arises with firmness and resolve and in solidarity with our allies.   Only thus will we ensure that today&apos;s peace is preserved on a permanent footing.   Above all, we must never repeat the mistakes of the 1930s, when we hoped for the best and were unprepared for the worst.   The dangers of such a policy were spelt out in the first ever central Statement on Defence, published by the British Government exactly 50 years ago.   That Statement contained the following premonitory lines:

&quot;Our desire to lead,the world towards disarmament by our example o

unilateral disarmament has not succeeded.   We have not contributed

thereby to general disarmament, and are approaching a point where we

agaios t

are not possessed of the necessary means of defending ourselves an aggressor.&quot;

A year later, in 1936, Hitler occupied the Rhineland.   The final consequence of this lack of preparedness was world war.

We shall continue to ensure that our forces are so &quot;tuctured and deployed that potential adversaries are in no douht of the  ave risk they would run in resorting to the use or threat of armed force against us.

npsnite differences 1U-   In all this, we must work closely with our allies. Despite

  aphasia among member nations, the prospects for the Alliance arc goo .

W been through many difficult periods in its history and has emerged *  *- strongar and more united.   One such period was the ,960s, when the  *    of flexible response was being formulated; another was more recently. *   - debate on intermediate-range nuclear forces (IW&gt; was at its height. 1,0 doubt there will be more debate and more differences of opinion, there  ^s have been and always will be In an alliance of free nations.   For in *  -ds of the present Secretary General of  ATO, lord Garrington, when he - Bmish Porelgn Secretary: &quot; e have learnt to sing in harmony, whereas


others - in the East for example - can only sing in unison&quot;.   We therefore

But

welcome debate: it shows that we are facing, not avoiding, the issues.

we should not mistake legitimate differences of approach for any slackening

in our unity of purpose in defending our freedom and democratic ideals.

112. One issue that will.be the subject of continuing discussion within the Alliance is the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI).   This US programme is intended to investigate the technical feasibility of defences against ballistic missiles.   Research in this area is permitted under existing treaties, and given the Soviet Union&apos;s own extensive and long-established research programme it is important that the West should not be left behind in this field.   The NATO allies are consulting closely and will continue to do so as the US research programme develops.   Further details are given in paragraph 121 and Annex A.

113. Another subject that has recently received much public attention is the continuing validity of NATO strategy.   This is discussed in some detail in the essay on page[    ].   As we explain there, we see no convincing case for major changes in NATO&apos;s overall strategic concept.   We believe that NATO&apos;s strategy of flexible response will continue to provide a sound a for meeting the Alliance&apos;s security requirements in the years ahead. 0ur

tsiVS of

aim should be not to seek a new strategy, but to find more effective implementing the one we have. A further important issue is Trident, an essay is devoted on page[    ].   It is our firm belief that no alternati

of

use of British resources would provide anywhere near such a strengthening

collective Alliance deterrence to aggression.   The debate on these su

.ii con&quot;

will no doubt continue, and we therefore hope that this Statement wx


*i*t. to a wider ann.r.t.ndln.  &lt; - Mf- ^ &quot; * &quot;&quot;^

Ayms Control

U*.    ona could deny that by any objective standard there are too .any -pons ln the  rld today.   W. do not share tb. gloomy prognostications of   . who ciaim that war is inevitable or that weapons, once possessed, are  -d to be used.   This would be to deny the validity of the concept of ^terrence, which has operated successfully now for more than 35 years. But *are i. no doubt that the world would benefit from a reduction in the leve -   . on both sides.   That is why we attach so much importance to the -ing of tension between Kast and West, and to the achievement of realistic, danced and verifiable measures of arms control and disarmament.   As an  st of ear approach, we set up within the Ministry of Defence on 2 lanuary

Veer a new Arms Control Unit, to wora in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in this field.

v, e~r- oreater international ll5-   Britain has played a leading role in the search for greater

 I* and a reduction in tension.   We have been in the forefront of all

 - multilateral negotiations in the field of arms control and disarmament

S1&quot;  the Second World War, and have become a party to most of the treaties

winded,   we Have followed the step-by-step approach endorsed by the inter-

community at the first United Matlons Special Session on Disarmament

   W,.   our search for lower levels of adamants, and indeed for the aboli-

    ^ certain types of weapon wherever practicable, has been serious and 8ustained.


116. A brief look at the period since the war shows that this approach has had some notable successes.   As Figure 1 shows, agreements reached include Treaties on the Antarctic, a Partial Test Ban, Outer Space, Nuclear Non-Proliferation, and the Sea-bed.   We also strongly supported US and Soviet bilateral negotiations on strategic weapons, which led to the SALT I agreeni the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the SALT II agreement.   A prime aim has been to reduce the risk of conflict and to strengthen international security To this end Britain, France and the United States have each signed agreement with the Soviet Union on &quot;hotlines&quot; and on the prevention of accidental

rity

nuclear war.    In 1975, 35 countries adopted the Helsinki Final Act on secu and cooperation in Europe; in continuation of this process, the Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe (CDE) opened in January 1984.

onfidenoe

117. But these agreements were only made possible by the climate of co

existing at the time.   Arms control measures are much more difficult to

reach in a climate of mutual suspicion.   That is why the British Governmen

, j.i. the

has been working actively to establish and foster better relations w East.    1984 and 1985 saw visits by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary

 .UU..   But the Government -ants progress, and we are doing aii

that we can to bring it about.   In tne following paragraph* we looK at the Ustory of, and prospects for. the Min arms control and disarmament negotia-tions of recent years.

M.   the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) began in June 1982. The  *ited States&apos; obiectlve. which was strongly supported by the  ATO allies,  as to Mte deep outs in both sides&apos; strategic arsenals, and the, put forward

  &quot;umber of proposals for doing so, emphasising the flexibility of their P  itlon.   The Soviet Union put forward more limited proposals and held

n   orii-h its INF deployments.   At the Progress hostage to NATO&apos;s not proceeding with its

of 1983 the Soviet Union walked out of the negotiations.

&quot;0. The origin of the bilateral United States/USSR   negotiations, whioh Wan 1  1981, uas mI0.s decision in 197, to modernise its longer-range INF     by the deployment in Europe of ground-launched cruise and Pershing II

This was needed because of the declining effectiveness of existing *  longer-range   forces (mainly United States Fill aircraft), and the ^reaalng threat from the large numbers of SS20 missiles being Introduced

* *. Soviet Union. At the same time aa the deployment decision, the Alliance  &quot;  -d its willingness to agree to lilt, on land-based missiles of this

The United States, with the full support of the Allies, put forward *  &quot;   option&quot;, under which NATO deployments would not begin if the Soviet U  n agreed to remove its SS20s; and offered flexibility in a number of &apos;&quot;&apos;-a in response to Soviet concerns.   The letter&apos;s position was, however, * damentally lnflexlble.   ne underlying Soviet aim was to retain a substan- o opoly ln lo eer-ra ge m -iaailaa while preventing the West from


deploying equivalent systems: the various offers they put forward would all have had this result.   This approach was coupled with a propaganda campaign designed to influence Western public opinion.   The Soviet Union walked out of the negotiations once NATO deployments began, despite the fact that the West had negotiated for two years while Soviet deployments of SS20s continue

121.   Another area of increasing importance is space, where we are anxious to prevent an arms race.   Experience suggests that progress in arms control can be easier to achieve when the weapons concerned are still at an early stage of development.   At their meeting at Camp David on 22 December 1984, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister agreed on four points, which were reaffirmed during their Washington discussions in February:

- the United States&apos; and Western aim is not to achieve superiorityi but to maintain balance, taking account of Soviet developments,

- SDI-related deployment would, in view of treaty obligations, have to be a matter for negotiation;

  and

- the overall aim is to enhance, and not to undermine, deterrenc

 irVi reduced

- East-West negotiation should aim to achieve security witn levels of offensive systems on both sides.

r in Geneva

122.   Against this background we very much welcomed the agreement

jnt0 neg &quot;

this January that the United States and Soviet Union would enter i*


tLtlon. on a complex o  &lt;ue.tion. concerning both apace and nuclear arms. * J agreed that the objective of the negotiationa would be to work out effective arrangements aimed at preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth, at limiting and reducing nuclear arms, and at strengthening strategic stability.   The fact that renewed negotiations began on U &quot;arch demonstrates that the firmness shown by the Atlantic Alliance over *e Ust year has borne fruit, for, despite Soviet pressure, we did not make  T one-sided concessions to bring the Soviet Union bach to the negotiating &apos; * .   The United States haa made clear its commitment to consultation with lt* slliaa, and   shall play a full and constructive part.

      As to conventional arms control, the scene has again been Mrked by

Western efforts but slow progress.   Soon after the opening in Stockholm    . Cm the United Kingdom, together with its NATO allies, tabled a maj0r -  f Proposal, designed to create greater openness about normal military &quot;tivities (for example, exercises) and thus reduce the likelihood of an &quot;&quot;&quot;break of hostilities by accident, design or mi.under.tanding. Progress sl   then has been slow, hut procedures have now been agreed which we &quot;  * will enable the Conference to get down to serious and constructive negotiations.

124     At the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction (MBEB) talks in Vienna, the S*&apos;eed negotiating goal is 900,000 ground and air forces on each side in an  ea of Central Europe covered by the two Germanles, Belgium, the Netherlands. L&quot;*e bourg, Poland and Chechoslovakia.   The exiating number from which the Ea-er  slda clalm8 lt 8hould 3tart to reduce to this level is disputed by *  &quot;est a. a seriou. underestimate, and in Apri! 19S0 NATO took an initiative


to break the deadlock by proposing a wholly revised format for the exchange of initial manpower data, concentrating on combat and combat support forces. This new initiative built on previous Eastern proposals and was intended as a response to Eastern concerns.   It has, however, met only with a negative response from the Warsaw Pact, while an Eastern initiative tabled in February failed to address the real issues.   We shall nevertheless continue to work in MBFR for a balanced agreement with satisfactory verification.

125.   The United Kingdom&apos;s policy on chemical weapons (CW) has been to seek

an arms control solution.   We abandoned our chemical warfare capability i 

the late 1950s, and there has been no change of policy since then.   The Sov

Union, by contrast, has continued with an extensive research and developn&gt;e

programme, increased its CW stockpile, and maintains a formidable capabili^

to wage offensive chemical warfare (see Annex A, paragraph 18).   At the Con

ence on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva in 1984, further progress was made towar

a comprehensive, worldwide, and verifiable ban on the development, product

stockpiling, transfer and use of CW and the destruction of existing stoc

although this was slower than we would have wished.   Several key problems

verification remain to be resolved.   The urgency of a ban was underlined

tne use

the report of the UN investigation team of 26 March 1984, confirming

of CW in the Gulf War.   As a result the British Government imposed expo

controls on certain civil chemicals which could be misused to make chemi

weapons; other OECD countries followed our lead.   The Geneva negotiation

were taken an important step further in April 1984, when US Vice Presid

t to state

Bush tabled a comprehensive draft treaty.   The Soviet Union has ye its detailed position on a number of key verification issues, although


*. accepted th. principle of on-site inspection of CW stockpile ^ruction, ^e United Kingdom has played an active tola in this and other negotiations at the CD.

Anally, onr commitment to the maintenance and strengthening of the ^national nnclear non-proliferation regime has been demonstrated by the &lt; U Part we have played in preparations for this year&apos;s Review Conference   tf. Son-Proliferation Treaty, of which the United Kingdom, together with    United States and Soviet Union, is a depository power.

12&apos;-   The prospects for arms control over the coming year are, as ever, &quot;&quot;icolt to predict.   The agreement between th.

ESSAY

TRIDENT

l.    The Unlted Kingdom has possessed nociear weapone now for over 30 years.  e have had a fully operational strategic nuclear capability since the -ry lM0 servlce   1955 of the V-homber, succeeded in the 1980s by nuclear-Powered aubmarines armed with the Polaris balliatic miasile bought from the &quot;cited States.   This force, now incorporating the Chevaline improvements to *. front end of the missiles, will remain an affective deterrent until well into th, l9908.   Wc d0 noC, however, believe that it can be relied upon to &quot;-Ida an effective national strategic nuclear deterrent much beyond the

by which time it will also become increasingly difficult and tensive to maintain.   Given the length of time needed to introduce into -&quot;ice a modern atr.tegic nuclear deterrent force, we decided in 1980 to -Piece Polaria with a force of four nuclear-powered submarines clipped  * Trident ballistic missiles.   This will ensure the maintenance of an effective deterrent until at least 2020.

*    deterrence la a matter of perception - not oura, but that of a potential pressor whoae values and attitudes may differ markedly from our own, and

 uture actlon8 cannot be predicted with certainty.   The key factor is *&gt; ^v^ perception of the United States&apos; willingness to hazard its own &quot;&quot;&quot;ory and citiaene for the aake of its allies.   In certain circumstances, th  Soviet leadership might doubt this commitment and miscalculate the


consequences of aggressive action against the democracies of Western Europe. Nuclear weapons in the possession of the United Kingdom greatly complicate the calculations of the Soviet leadership in assessing whether they could undertake such action without risking a nuclear conflict.    This provides an essential element in the deterrent strategy of the NATO Alliance, and is welcomed as such by our allies, including the United States.

3. To provide an effective deterrent, Britain&apos;s strategic nuclear force

of

must be certain of inflicting on the Soviet Union an unacceptable level damage.    It must therefore be capable of posing a credible threat to key aspects of Soviet state power; and of posing such a threat at all times. There must be no possibility that it could be neutralised by pre-emptive attack: either by a &quot;bolt-from-the-blue&quot; in a period of apparently stable and peaceful international relations, or during a period of tension or conventional hostilities.   And it must be capable of meeting these requir ments throughout its service life, in the face of technical changes and advances in the defensive systems that it would have to penetrate.

4. These are very demanding requirements and cannot be met cheaply or easily.    But a force which failed to meet them would provide not secu

of ^

but the illusion of security.   Against this background, the provision nuclear deterrent force called for two basic choices to be made: about launch platform and about the weapon system itself.

5. The launch platform had as far as possible to be invulnerable to

llv invul&quot;

emptive attack; in practice, this required the force to be virtuaxxy nerable to detection.    Only submarines meet this criterion effective 7


Urface ships, aircraft and ground-launched systems do not, particularly if hey constitute the whole of a very small strategic force such as ours, | ather than elements of much larger and more diverse forces such as those of t e Soviet Union or the United States.   There is no realistic prospect that |

oviet Union will be able to destroy our submarines at a time of its own hoosing in the foreseeable future.

^he invulnerability of a submarine force stems not only from the nature

the vessel and the medium in which it operates, but also from the nature I  f it

operations.   Some have suggested that a British strategic nuclear I deterrent-  

 c rorce could be provided not by submarines dedicated solely for

I this

Purpose, but by mounting nuclear missiles on hunter-killer submarines

eaQy deployed for conventional operations.   The deployment patterns and

rations undertaken by the two types of submarine are, however, quite

erent.   a submarine cannot be held in reserve for a last-resort strategic I string

and simultaneously carry out another role, in which it would aim to

I Seek

 ut ant* destroy the enemy, thereby putting itself at risk of detection. I Either th

ne submarine&apos;s effectiveness in its conventional role would be

I vit^

e&lt;*; or the strategic deterrent would be put at risk and therefore lose &apos; Ability.

e choice of weapon system lay essentially between a ballistic and a I crm8e mi

ssile.   The options were carefully studied.    Cruise missiles can &apos;. Usefuliy n

pr vide one element of a varied nuclear deterrent force, but they

&apos; &apos;8uffer fP

o  a number of disadvantages which are important for a small 1 deterrent t

-torce of last resort.   They are more vulnerable to Soviet defensive

I systems

which, unlike anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems, are not cons-


trained by arms control limitations; and because their range is currently considerably less than that of ballistic missiles, submarines carrying them would have far less sea-room in which to hide and would therefore be less difficult to detect and destroy.   Moreover, cruise missiles carry only one warhead each.   Because of this, and their greater vulnerability to antimissile defensive systems, a large number of cruise missiles would be needed to provide a deterrent force comparable to that of a much smaller number of multi-warhead ballistic missiles.    Such a force would inevitably require more submarines - the single most expensive element of our deterrent. Although an individual cruise missile costs less than a ballistic missile* a cruise missile force would therefore be either less effective or more expensive than one based on ballistic missiles.

8.     Of the possible options for providing a ballistic missile, purchase fr0 the United States has the advantage of building on the highly successful collaboration between the .two countries on Polaris over two decades, and enables us to take advantage of the very advanced technology developed by the United States, at significantly less cost than if we developed it our selves.   There are, moreover, major operational and financial advantages buying a missile that will be entering service with the United States Navy in the same timescale: to ensure commonality we have chosen the Trident missile system.   This missile is more expensive to buy than the Trident but, because we will enjoy access to United States through-life logi-st^c support, running costs will be much lower.   In addition, the D5 offers best prospects of being able to penetrate Soviet anti-ballistic missile defences in the face of possible improvements during the lifetime of tn system. i


i-.i ii ii.           i  ,  i  ! i ......i     .....  i          mi     i................. -. iih    -nil ......-         ..       .....-

The Trident D5 has a greater range and accuracy than Polaris and is aPable of carrying more warheads.   This has led to suggestions that we are cquiring a force which is not only greater than is required for deterrence  ne but is also capable of mounting a &quot;first strike&quot; against the Soviet * n*   This is not so.   A first strike would involve a surprise attack | ntended to destroy the other side&apos;s retaliatory capability before it |  Uld be launched.    Such a concept plays no part in the thinking of NATO, |

^ited States, or the United Kingdom:   our policy is solely to deter an |

attack     a i     a successful first strike could not, in any case, be achieved by

her NATO or the Soviet bloc, because it would be impossible to detect and | cleg t*T

v Pre-emptively even a major part of the mobile and submarine-launched

syg

ms Mailable to both sides.    For the United Kingdom acting alone, a ul first strike would be impossible even against just the Soviet

sil

hased ICBM force, which includes a far greater number of missiles than

number of warheads available to this country.   We neither have nor seek |

to have a fM i urst-strike capability; and we could not achieve it even if we

wiahed. .

I 10. The

new force will indeed represent an enhancement of capability over

polaris.

it will, for example, have greater range and will be able to carry

m re Warh

I eads.   But such enhancements are essential given improvements in

S viet d

I &quot;   etensive capabilities.    Since the late 1960s, when our Polaris entered|

1 ServiCe

    ne Soviet Union has deployed the only operational ABM system in

I seryic

I anywhere in the world and is currently modernising and improving it. |

11118 means

I that if the Soviet Union is to be denied a sanctuary from nuclear |

attack with1

I 111 its territory we need the ability to carry more warheads in

future to

. Pose the same threat in deterrence terms as in the early days of


I  Polaris.   The increased range of the Trident D5 missiles will give the sub-| marines far more sea-room in which to conceal themselves, thereby enhancing |  their ability to avoid detection as Soviet anti-submarine warfare techniques | improve.   Nevertheless, the United Kingdom&apos;s deterrent force rests and will continue to rest on the ability to maintain only one submarine on patrol at all* times.   We have also made clear that we do not intend to deploy more | warheads with Trident D5 than would have been deployed with Trident C4. The |  United Kingdom&apos;s deterrent force, when equipped with Trident, will remain the minimum size compatible with cost-effectiveness and credibility*

|  11.   It would have been possible to maintain and re-furbish Trident missi es

| in this country, as we do with Polaris; but the United States is willing to

make its own extensive facilities available, and we have made arrangement

to use them.   Substantial savings will therefore be obtained both in cap

I and running costs by avoiding the duplication in this country of facility

I which - because of Trident&apos;s requirements for less frequent servicing

I would have been used much less frequently than those currently used f r

qible bad I

Polaris processing.    This cooperation, which would not have been poss I we not switched from Trident C4 to D5, will provide a satisfactory and I economical means of maintaining the missiles of the British strategic I deterrent.

there** I

12.    Trident will undoubtedly cost a lot of money: money that will no I fore be available for other defence purposes.   Nevertheless, this needs I be kept in perspective.   In the first place, Trident will consume only a I small part of the real increase in the defence budget since 1978-79. I second place, although the capital cost of Trident will inevitably dep

1 ~~ ^


actors such as inflation and fluctuations in the exchange rate, we estimated hen we first decided to buy the system that it would account on average for nj-v about 3% of the overall defence budget and about 6% of the equipment udget during the procurement period of some 18 to 20 years; and that alculation remains essentially unchanged.

There is nothing unusual about fitting large equipment purchases into

e ence programme: it is a normal part of defence planning and budget ting. I Furtherm

more, while the capital cost of a strategic nuclear deterrent force

oonsiderable, running costs are comparatively small:   Polaris, for I instance =.

c  accounts for less than 2% of the defence budget and employs just

er 2,000 of Britain&apos;s 335,000 Servicemen.   By contrast, the capital cost of

entionai forces is only one - and by no means the most demanding - of all

expenses associated with establishing them: the costs of running and

*n8 them are substantial and significant.   Impressions that we could I 8ustain

much larger conventional forces without a Polaris replacement than I with it _

are, therefore, well wide of the mark.

| 14. So

me have alleged that Trident calls into question our commitment to

I arms p

tol.   This is quite false.   We are firmly committed to the pursuit

I of }ja^

anced and verifiable measures of arms control and disarmament.    But the

ajority of the world&apos;s nuclear weapons are in the hands of the Super-I Powers: cl- ,

nearly, therefore, these arsenals must be the first priority for

I reducti0n

Although Trident will represent a minimum independent deterrent

&apos; CaPabiilt f

y ror the United Kingdom, we have not said that it would never be I relevant to

arms control.    On the contrary, we have made it clear that if

I soviet and

United States strategic arsenals were very substantially reduced,


I and if no significant improvements had occurred in Soviet defensive capabilities, we should want to review our position and consider how best we could contribute to arms control in the light of the reduced threat.

| 15.   Like Polaris, Trident will be assigned to NATO and targetted in support

[ of the policy and strategic concepts that have been collectively agreed.

I Our strategic deterrent remains, however, at all times under the independent

| control of the British Government and could be employed independently of

I the Alliance should our supreme national interests so dictate.   A British

I strategic nuclear deterrent force provides the ultimate guarantee of our

The

| national security and makes a unique contribution to the NATO Alliance.

I question at issue is not whether this country should become a nuclear powe

we

| it is whether we should give up a major defence capability and role that

| already possess.   Critics of Trident must show that we would be less, rath

I than more, vulnerable to attack if we unilaterally abandoned a capability

and

that has been an integral, part of the structure of collective Western

I European security for over 30 years; or else they must argue persuasively

I that an alternative system could provide a credible and cost-effective

I deterrent in the complex and demanding environment of the early decades

I the next century.   We are convinced that for Britain to abandon its nucl

urity

| deterrent would constitute a reckless gamble with the peace and sec I future generations; and that the Trident D5 system is the best way of | providing a credible deterrent into the 21st century.

CHAPTER TWO;   THE WESTERN APPROACH United Kingdom in NATO

&gt;01. The tath AtUntic Alliance, which the foundation of our security

 lioy, haa been inetrumental in maintaining peace and security in the Treaty

for more than 35 years.   The hey principle enshrined in Article V of *   orth Atlantic Treaty - that an attach on one member is considered an &quot;tech on all - has provided far greater security than any member could have thieved alone.

  . The United Kingdom sharea the benefita and obligations of Alliance -amberahip, as endorsed by succeaaive Governments since the Treaty was

Policies and their military capahilitiea atill poae the main threat *  - security of the United Kingdom, and our policy is to concentrate our  *  effort within the Alliance in the waya that can beat contribute to its strength and to our own security.

  . We commit the vast majority of our forces and some 95% of our defence ^t dlrectly   lndlrectly to the Alliance.   Britain is the only European   io  to contribute to all three elements of NATCs forces: strategic nuclear,

nuclear and conventional.   Forces are provided for all three ma^or 8 0 Cornea . the Atlantic, Europe and Channel.   British forces of all   - Serviees participate in NATO&apos;s apecialist reinforcement forces, which


LC580/3

have important roles in the defence of the Northern and Southern Flanks an provide a tangible demonstration of the Alliance&apos;s cohesion and readiness to give effect, if necessary, to the terms of Article V.

 

204. Our military contribution is concentrated in four areas, which are discussed in detail in Chapter 4:

- British Nuclear Forces:    an independent element of strategic and theatr nuclear forces committed to the Alliance.   The introduction of Trident will provide a credible independent strategic nuclear deterrent into the 21st century (see pages [ ]).

- The United Kingdom:    our homeland and an essential base for the supP r

Atlantic

of NATO.   A forward base for NATO forces operating in the Eastern and North Sea; a main base for operations in the Channel; and a suppo base for both British and American forces stationed on the mainland Europe, and for those who would reinforce NATO in tension or war.

- The European Mainland,    divided into two regions:

&quot;The forward

-   The Central Region:    the Alliance&apos;s heartland in Europe. &quot;*

itself&quot;

defence of the Federal Republic is the forward defence of Britain

as Cmnd 8288 said.   We maintain 55,000 troops and a tactical air f rc

there, in accordance with our Brussels Treaty obligations and as

demonstration of our commitment to the forward defence and reinfor

iv trebled*

ment of Europe.    In wartime, the size of BAOR would be nearly


The Northern Region: of importance to the Lntegrity of the Alliance and critical for the containment of the Soviet and Northern Baltic fleets.   Flexible and mobile amphibious and airborne forces are committed t0 its defence.

The East-em Atlantic and Channel:    vital to the forward defence of the United Kingdom base and the Northern Flank, and to the safe passage of tbe essential reinforcements - equipment, manpower and oil - that would cross the Atlantic and on which the defence of Europe would depend. Britain remains NATO&apos;s major European maritime power.   Nearly the whole 01 the Royal Navy and a large number of RAF maritime aircraft are assigned to NATO, and permanent contributions are made to NATO&apos;s Standing Naval F rce Atlantic and the Standing Naval Force Channel.

205. w

6 remain fully committed to providing a substantial British contribution in all f

 ur areas, and there is no likelihood of major changes being made

eithe

co the levels or to the capabilities of these forces in the foreseeable

future. Peyelnn

^SgJlts in NATO1 a Defence Posture 206  The

past year has seen a growing public debate about NATO&apos;s strategy of

flexible

response and forward defence in the light of changes in the military balanCe- au

&apos;    oout the roles of conventional and nuclear weapons in NATO&apos;s strategy; about Ch

n8es to tactics and weapons needed to ensure credible deterrence; and about th

ne Potential for improving conventional forces, through the appli-

Catl n of  

new technology.   We welcome this debate, for it is vital in a


democratic society that people should clearly understand the issues involved in maintaining defences sufficient to deter aggression.   We believe it is appropriate, this year, to address these questions in detail.   In the essay on page[   ] we explain the origins of NATO&apos;s strategy, examine its continuing validity and analyse some of the alternatives that have been put forward. In the following paragraphs we examine some of the steps the Alliance is. taking to ensure that the strategy remains effective in the face of the evolving threat.

207. NATO has a highly developed and effective biennial defence planning process, which involves the Defence Ministers of all countries participating in the integrated military structure.    Its purpose is twofold:    to encourag nations to develop their individual defence plans in a direction benefici3* to the Alliance and to provide the necessary resources to achieve this, and to monitor the progress made by nations in meeting agreed Alliance goals*

*

208. Every two years, Ministers issue Guidance to the Major NATO Commanders

Knological

and to nations setting out the political, economic, military and techn factors that could affect the development of NATO forces and their impact NATO strategy.   At this May&apos;s meeting of NATO&apos;s Defence Planning Committee

i 992  

(DPC), Ministers are due to issue Guidance covering the period up to

On the basis of this Guidance the Major NATO Commanders prepare a set of

Force Goals, which constitute the targets at which each nation is expect

planning

to aim.   Each year member nations provide a response to a NATO Defence

Questionnaire, in which they record their progress in implementing Force

2^ plans*

Goals, together with information on economic, logistic and force lev


math five-year forward plan for Ministerial These are examined and collated into a NATO five year

consideration.   This December Ministers will consider the plan for the years 1986 to 1990.

 . Successful forward planning la central to the maintenance of effective

deterrent forces.  Moreover, the planning procedures are flexible and subject

- constant refinement.   Increasing emphasia is being pot on long-term planning

Signed to provide early guidance on Alliance defence needs up to 20 years

The Alliance has agreed, for example, a long-Term Planning Guideline

  *  interdiction of Soviet follow-on forces, sometimes referred to as

vnvs in NATO&apos;s long-standing conventional

F0FA; this deals with improvements in NA1U s long

j *4^Aa   rhe disruption of enemy lability for the interdiction of enemy airfields, the

.-w.ties are developing a Conceptual targets.   ln addition, NATO military authorities are

&quot;Uitery P_h, the better to enable priorities to be set for conventional     improvements, including the sensible application of emerging technology.

Ministers also gave an impetus to the development and coordination of *  . PUnning process last Oecember when they called for a coherent effort  &quot; Her to improve NATO conventional defences.   The worh is moving ahead and ls a dressi 8, laBjUfc the better use of defence resources, the encouragement of   . &apos;        efforts to coordinate defence procurement,

LC580/3

211. Much NATO equipment still has a qualitative advantage over the Warsaw Pact&apos;s, although the gap is narrowing.   Attention has been focussed, there fore, on whether new or emerging technology might enable the Alliance to increase its conventional capability at affordable cost over the next decade.

212. Emerging technology is not a panacea for all NATO&apos;s problems; nor does it offer an alternative strategy.   And there is nothing special about it- the sensible application of new technology is something that we seek constantly&gt; as Chapter 4 illustrates.   New technology is not cheap; nor ts it risk-free. It could be self-defeating were it to lead to the diversion of funds from other critical areas.   The rate of introduction of new technology and t e balance between the quality and quantity of new equipments have to be care fully weighed.   A close watch must be kept on the effect of sophisticated new conventional weaponry on arms control negotiations, and on the possibi that the Warsaw Pact might develop similar systems and effective counterme New technologies can create the potential for new tactics, which have to developed carefully to ensure that on balance deterrence is strengthened. There must also be an equitable sharing of the technological and industri opportunities.

&gt;-ir examina&quot;

213. Bearing all this in mind, NATO has been conducting a systematic

che 1990s

tion of the opportunities for exploiting new technology both up to

and in the longer term.   This has covered the application of technology

the Central Front, on the flanks and at sea.   During the past twelve mon

feasibility studies have begun on the NATO Frigate Replacement (NFR 90^&apos;

t     -Ranee Stand-work is shortly expected to start on two other projects: a i.ong

Off Missile (LRSOM) and a Short-Range Anti-Radiation Missile (SRARM)* A


LC580/3

tudy has also begun Into prospects for cooperation in research and develop-01 technologies that have potential long-term military applications.

214

Many commentaries on emerging technology have given prominence to the

WayS in which it could enhance NATO&apos;s ability to attack Soviet follow-on forces i v

*n the land battle, as described in the Alliance&apos;s Long-Term Planning Cuidel-in f

ine vsee paragraph 209 above).    Given the Soviet ability and tactical intentin

 n to bring overwhelming force to bear on a particular axis of attack,

&quot;^kes sound military sense to check the momentum of their advance, to

^Pt the arrival of their reinforcements and to ease the pressure on NATO 1 s

own front-line defences.    Interdiction of Soviet follow-on forces owever, only one use for new technology, and Alliance forces facing

first

echelon Warsaw Pact forces need a comprehensive range of modern weaponry if they

are to stop, counter-attack, and eventually defeat Warsaw Pact

armourer! =. j

and mechanised regiments on NATO territory.

2l5  Th

e Alliance is therefore giving priority to the sustained improvement of lts f

ront-Hne forces, by restructuring them, by applying new technology tQ battleH

rleld equipments, and by the expansion and better training of reserve f rces. U

 ence, for example, the reorganisation of 1(BR) Corps (see also

ParagraDh

s 418 and 419) has resulted in better-balanced front-line forces and stronger rPc

eserves.   There are three regular armoured divisions, two of which  yed forward and are better able to cope effectively with a short

Wa^in8

cack.    One of the brigades of the third division is undergoing

trials in

We are increasing the numbers of reserves that would be available on mobilisation, both through the expan sion of the Territorial Army, and by using   our individual reservists more effectively.   Exercise LIONHEART (see page [     ]) demonstrated clearly both our ability to reinforce British Forces Germany in time of tension and the effectiveness of our reserve forces.

Beyond the NATO Area

our

216. British defence policy also needs to be set in the wider context of oU international security objectives.   The United Kingdom retains a number of responsibilities outside the NATO area, most notably for the external defence of the remaining dependent territories, ranging from Hong Kong

its 5 million inhabitants to the Pitcairn Islands with 60.    To meet these responsibilities we maintain garrisons, with a supporting naval presence, in Hong Kong and the Falkland Islands; and we also have forces in wealth countries of Belize and Brunei.

While no Western country, and certainly not the united Kingdom, can carry alone the burden of sustaining this framework, neither tan an, Western country dissociate Itself from a share of the responsibility   r doing an.   It is in both our own interest and the interest of the West senerally that Britain retains defence facilities in strategic locations  &lt;* as Cypnns, Ascension Island and Blego Garcia; that we commit naval ^ces to areas such as the Arabian Sea and the Garibbe.n; and that we maintain   worldwide programme of military deployments and exercises.

*  existence of a military presence represents only one side of our a^vlty outside the NATO area.   Our aim in the first instance must be to &lt; ng diplomatic and economic efforts to bear in areas of potentisl insta-Wlity so as to help maintain peace and combat the activities of the Soviet   io  and its proxies.   But we sre also capable of intervening militarily, adther alone or in concert with our allies,, to defend our own Interests or    &quot;spouse to a repeat for help.   Ways in which we sre enhancing our capacity t0 md.rtake auch interventions are described in Ghapter 4. The

220. Another important contribution made by our Services is their participa tion in international peacekeeping forces.   Our activities in this sphere were described in some detail in last year&apos;s Statement; British forces have a proud record in the difficult and sometimes hazardous business of maintaining peace between opposing communities, in places where violence can break out and spread rapidly as a result of seemingly trivial incidents.

221. There is unlikely to be a major change in the pattern of our out-of&apos;are

activities in the near future.   NATO commitments will remain our overriding

priority; and our ability to act outside the NATO area will be based on

ensuring that selected units whose primary roles are within the Alliance

also deploy rapidly at long range in a crisis.   Our permanent garrisons wi

continue to account for the major part of the small portion of our defenc

budget devoted to out-of-area activities, although some changes can be

foreseen.   In paragraph 454 we describe, for example, the steps being ta

ESSAY

NATO STRATEGY

,atpr.rence and defence.   As the 1.    NATO&apos;s security policy is based on deterrence

,    a    1082 said:    &quot;Our purpose Communique issued at the end of the Bonn Summit in

* to prevent war and, while safeguarding democracy, to build the foundations

j*   nf the North Atlantic area ^tack... our purpose is to preserve the security of the

,  . . aeeression and

*y means of conventional and nuclear forces adequate to

,    .it- threatens no one; it has no intimidation.&quot;   NATO&apos;s strategy is reactive, it tn

 -  of option or of aeihing  &quot; -U - i****- *  &quot;  **..   The prl.e aim la to prevent war.   The secondary ai , should

. v,t- level to make the aggressor Agression occur, is to respond at the right level

quickly cease his attack and withdraw.

2-    * is revealing to racall the origins of tha strategy of flexible 1  hich was adopted in December !967, and in whose formulation the

n. .     a fore its adoption, NATO I

Cne&quot; British Government played a major part. Before

tended on the concept of massive nuclear retaliation in the face of

^ slo  at any level:   the ao-called tripwire strategy.   But the Soviet

Virion in the 1960s of the ability to strike OS territory with nuclear

  P-s destroyed the credibility of tripwire; the threat that the Onited

St- v, a strategic nuclear attack |

States would automatically and immediately launch a strateg


LC580/4

on Russia in response to conventional aggression had irretrievably lost its deterrent force.

3. Some ten years lapsed, however, between the first suggestion that should revise its strategy and the adoption of flexible response.   1  tne course of that process, virtually every issue that has emerged in the curren questioning of NATO strategy was addressed in depth by the Alliance: the reliability of the United States nuclear guarantee;  the feasibility of achieving a satisfactory conventional balance in Europe;  the benefits and risks of retaining the option of first use of nuclear weapons; and the implications for deterrence of stronger conventional defences and of delayi for as long as possible consideration of the use of nuclear weapons.

4. Three key principles underlie NATO&apos;s strategy of flexible response:

- a manifest determination to act jointly and to defend the Treaty Are

,      nf the NorthJ against all forms of aggression, as reflected in Article v oj.

Atlantic Treaty;

- a recognisable capability to respond effectively at all levels of

aggression, and to escalate, if necessary, to convince the aggre

M, attack I

that he has miscalculated NATO&apos;s resolve and should cease ni  and withdraw; and

- a flexibility that prevents the Soviet Union from predicting w

id lead the |

confidence NATO&apos;s specific response to aggression, and shou Warsaw Pact to conclude that any attack on the West, whateve


LC580/4

nature, place or time, would expose the aggressor to an unacceptable &apos; risk. |

These three principles are built on a combination of political will and |

I Ollitarv i sJL postnro.    The latter comprises three elements, which must be both

1 Vislble and credible: |

&apos; I Conventional forces to deter any Soviet non-nuclear attack, to counter | it as far forward as possible, and to allow time for reinforcements to | arrive. They must be sufficient in size and equipment, and so trained | and deployed, as to ensure that the Soviet leadership can have no illusion of a quick or easy conventional victory.

I

Theatre nuclear forces to enhance deterrence by providing a link between conventional and strategic nuclear forces, providing flexibility for options short of a strategic exchange, and deterring use  f theatre nuclear forces by the other side.   They also enhance the effectiveness of conventional forces by, for example, complicating any plans an aggressor might have for massing forces for an attack.

, I &quot;&quot;St

  -ateflir nuclear forces to provide the ultimate deterrent.   They must |

be able to inflict unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union even after | a Soviet pre-emptive first strike.   There is no substitute for the

, United States strategic guarantee, nor, if it is to remain credible, |

  linkage with a strong United States conventional and theatre |

nuclear presence in Europe. |

| . I


LC580/4

| Unless the Alliance maintains this range of forces, there is a risk, that the |  Soviet Union might calculate that it could escalate any conflict to a level at | which the Alliance had no credible response.   Effective deterrence requires a

full range of military options; the elements of the triad are mutually I supportive, and all are essential.

6. There are a number of misunderstandings about the nature of flexible

|  response that it is important to correct.   First, it does not commit NATO

i The I

| to respond to an attack in a pre-ordained way, conventional or nuclear.

| strategy is not, as some have suggested, a rigid construction akin to a

| ladder, on each rung of which the Alliance would have to step on its way to

a final strategic exchange.   Nor does it require NATO to match the Warsaw

is I

Pact system for system at every level.   The strength of flexible respons that it provides NATO commanders and political authorities with a wide rang of options, for use as appropriate.

7. Secondly, there is no absolute nuclear threshold in the sense that a

nuclear response would automatically follow from a given level of convent

rj pact, I

attack.   Although NATO&apos;s forces are outnumbered by those of the Warsaw

conveu-&quot; i

they are well trained and equipped and would not easily succumb to a

weapons I

tional attack, even on a massive scale.   NATO&apos;s possession of nuclear

does not mean that, if deterrence failed, they would necessarily be used,

still less does it mean that NATO strategy is based on the intention of

fighting and winning a nuclear war.   The Allies need no convincing that

there would be no winner in such a war.   It does mean, however, that t

Soviet Union must reckon with the possibility that NATO would be prepare

if necessary, to use nuclear weapons in self-defence. ,


I 8

thirdly, flexible response is not an offensive strategy;  it threatens no I

ne*   It does not encompass any concept of a &quot;first strike&quot; - a pre-emptive I

ttack designed to eliminate the nuclear forces of the Warsaw Pact - nor I I does if j

c ^-mply a commitment to the early use of nuclear weapons.    But NATO annot wiliing]_y concede territory in order to buy time; nor can it afford I

See an extensive and protracted war, whether conventional or nuclear, I | fougnj. n

over its own territory.   The Alliance must demonstrate to the Soviet rs that they could not undertake aggression against NATO territory

I ^Itho

ut putting their own homeland, their forces and those of their Warsaw I Pact alnQ

ies at risk.   NATO has long possessed the capability to strike deep to enemy territory if attacked; it would be a serious abdication of I P nsibiiity by Alliance Governments were they to renounce this capability. I

I ^ut

Un ess aggression were committed against a member of the Alliance, none I I of NATO&apos;., f

rorces, whether conventional or nuclear, would ever be used.

I The mess

a8e for the Warsaw Pact is simple and unambiguous: if you do not I attack NATn

you have nothing to fear.

^S^i^trate^ | I Alth

enough flexible response has been with us for a long time and has

I Proved

uccessful, some have questioned whether it is still the best strategy I

&apos; for NATO,   t u

j-n the following paragraphs we consider some of the alternatives

haVe bee&quot; Put forward. |

I 10. Alli

, ance strategy must be credible to ordinary people as well as to

I 8 vernme

. s in the West.   Equally, however, it is vital not to address the

1 VaIidity

y of flexible response solely from a Western perspective.   NATO&apos;s aim


I is to influence Soviet calculations and to ensure that Soviet leaders conclude)

I that, whatever the incentive, the military gamble would not be worth taking*

I The key question that needs to be asked when addressing alternative strategie

| is:    &quot;Would the Soviet Union consider the risks associated with aggression

9 it

to be increased or reduced were NATO to change from flexible response.

i   11.   One of the more radical alternatives proposed is the concept of social

defence through passive resistance, civil disobedience or guerilla warfare.

I   But this option would be most unlikely to prove a convincing deterrent.

I   could only take effect after occupation by the aggressor.   It is, therefore,

i   essentially a national policy that would allow the West European nations to

f r example*I

be picked off individually.   It would provide no defence against, rot I   a blockade of the United Kingdom designed to starve the country into submi I   sion.   Moreover, resistance of this nature depends on the occupying power I   being inhibited by the attitudes of its own people and other nations from I   adopting oppressive measures; there are no grounds for believing that

it i8

restraint would be felt by the Soviet Union.   Perhaps most important,

i  wholly unrealistic to suppose that the countermeasures envisaged in socia

defence would be viewed by the Soviet Union as any demonstration of the

jit would

United Kingdom&apos;s or NATO&apos;s will or capability to resist attack, ana be irresponsible of the Government to rely on such measures.

is that i

I  12.   Natural distaste for nuclear weapons has led to several proposa I  aim to make their use less likely.   Some suggest that unilateral nuclea I  disarmament by the United Kingdom would underline our peaceful intentio I and prompt others to follow our example.   There is no evidence to supP0


view.   On the contrary, as illustrated in Chapter 1, history shows *lat by 0ne-sidedly reducing our defence capabilities we Increase the risk |

Of ty&amp;r      t\j l

    disarmament must be equitable and multilateral if it is to enhance &quot;-nan decrease our security.

&gt;-uers suggest that the West should abandon particular elements of its nuclear

armoury such as battlefield nuclear weapons.   But changes such as

thi

Can only be made if they do not breach the seamless robe of deterrence

y  Pening Up gaps in NATO&apos;s capabilities that the Warsaw Pact might feel | it coul t\

exploit to its advantage: otherwise deterrence is weakened.

l4  nuc]

cxear weapon-free zones are believed by some to offer a safer future for Eum

 Pe.   Apart from the dangers of breaking the vital link with the US nudear f

forces that provide the ultimate guarantee of NATO security, this ldea faiiq

  t0 take into account three significant factors.    First, the ^^rrito

ry  f the zone would remain under threat from long-range weapons

locate^

  outside It (for example, SS20s sited east of the Urals can threaten | m st of w

I estern Europe).    Secondly, the mobility of modern missile systems

means that hVi 1 I cney could be rapidly redeployed in a period of tension; this

woulrj be

I 6 easier for the Soviet Union than for the West.   Thirdly, the Soviet |

I  uld bring its conventional superiority to bear in such zones with

lesa risk of

   t provoking an escalation in the conflict: deterrence against the  utbreak 0f h

I hostilities would be weakened.    Geographical re-distributions

of nuclear

  weapons are no substitute for their overall reduction and ultimate | eliroinati0

  n through balanced arras control agreements - an aim to which NATO

remains fuli

&apos;-uily committed.


I   15.   Much has been made of the Soviet Union&apos;s declaration that it will never

I   be the first to use nuclear weapons.    The Alliance&apos;s own, far more corapre en sive, commitment - that none of its weapons will ever be used except in response to attack (see paragraph 1) - is overlooked amid calls for a no

|   first use of nuclear weapons&apos; undertaking by NATO.   The NATO allies believe

I   that such an undertaking would reduce the risks to be taken into account by the Soviet leadership when contemplating, in a crisis, launching a con

I   ventional attack from a position of Warsaw Pact superiority in convention forces.   As a result, the risk of war would be increased.    It strengthens

I  deterrence that the Warsaw Pact is not allowed to believe that a limite conventional war could be fought in Europe without involving a risk of nuclear conflict.    This does not, of course, mean that the Alliance is c0 mitting itself in advance to the use of nuclear weapons in response to

I  attack: it is simply keeping Its options open, to increase the uncertainty in the mind of the potential aggressor and hence Increase deterrence.

I   16.    Some people argue that intermediate-range nuclear forces and any ot

short-range deployments are unnecessary for the West and undesirable I   they might lead to limited nuclear war, and suggest that we should g 

The &apos;

I  to relying entirely on the United States&apos; strategic nuclear defences.

Id strategyi

problem with this argument Is that It would imply a return to the o

e all I

of tripwire, would weaken the United States-Europe link, and would pos I  the same difficulties for deterrence that led to the abandonment of the

original strategy in the 1960s. ,

ntef the

17. A further suggestion made is that it would be possible to coun I Warsaw Pact threat by conventional means alone.    But as the present


Secretary General of NATO, Lord Carrington, said of those who want NATO to | I abandon nuclear weapons: |

&apos; I they must explain how we would face up to a Soviet Union which enjoyed |

a nuclear monopoly.   To talk of increasing conventional forces in such

circumstances is not enough.   First, because the resource costs would

be very substantial.   And secondly, because no amount of conventional

improvement would protect the West from nuclear blackmail.   The advocates|

 f non-nuclear defence have to explain why a Soviet Union with a nuclear |

monopoly would launch a conventional attack against a conventionally

well-defended position, when it could threaten a devastating nuclear

strike without fear of effective retaliation.   And they must explain

also what answer they would give if such a threat were made.   To say of

the Soviet leaders  &apos;Oh, but they wouldn&apos;t&apos; is not an answer.    It is |

Just wishful thinking.&quot; |

I

I   18. t

Proposing reliance on new generations of conventional weapons, some

emphasis to the desirability of NATO&apos;s forces being seen to be entirely | defensive tuj

J-nis suggests that there is a clear-cut distinction between offen-|

I sive and

defensive systems:    a distinction that does not, in fact, exist.

M reover

  the argument again overlooks the need for Western forces to act

as a dot-

errent.   There is little or no historical evidence to show that non-

I      Of f Q

ive defence alone has ever deterred aggression.    Such a strategy would | reduCe the *4 i *

nsK for a potential aggressor by making his territory, in effect, |

tnary.    The enemy may well be willing to take the risk, and pay the | &apos; P tential e

cost, of losing his military forces in the field if he knows that

I his 0Wtl .

omeland could not be attacked in return.   But If he is faced with a |


LC580/4

threat of retaliation he is likely to be far more reluctant to embark on aggression.

19.   None of the above alternatives therefore passes the test of improving

To

deterrence, for none would, be more convincing to a potential aggressor, the extent that they would simplify Warsaw Pact operational planning or leave NATO forces at risk the alternatives would work to Soviet advantage, weaken deterrence, and make aggression more likely.   None can therefore be regarded as more credible or safer than flexible response.

303. Since 1971 the defence expenditure of European NATO countries has been

increasing in real terms at an average rate of just over 2% per year. ^n

1983 it was more than 27% higher, in real terms, than in 1971.   But while the

amount of money spent on defence is commonly taken as a measure of defence

effort, what really matters is the output gained from that expenditure: the

tanks, ships, aircraft and trained fighting men for which it pays. United

States reinforcements for Europe are, of course, critical to NATO plans,

2

deterrence must start with the peacetime balance of power.   As Figure

 t a a fhe major

shows, of ready forces stationed in Europe, the Europeans proviae

part: 90% of the manpower, 85% of the tanks, 95% of the artillery and 80% of

the combat aircraft; to these must be added the European contribution of

over 70% of the major warships in the Atlantic and European waters (85^

of NATO&apos;s

all warships).   Moreover, the European allies provide a major part

military hardware (some 60% of all NATO&apos;s combat aircraft and tanks, f r

example) although Europe&apos;s gross domestic product is less than half of

NATO total.   The full mobilised strength of the European forces approaches

million men, as against 3| million for the United States.   Nor is this a

introduced

static contribution: improvements and new equipment are being wide

The first priority, since the eariy 1970s, has seen to protect &lt;tont-U e aircraft already deployed at European hases.   Eollowing the 1971-

to increase expenditure on ammunition stocks by 13% in real terms between 1981 and 1984 and is planning to sustain this rate of growth until 1987; and the United Kingdom has funds earmarked over the next few years to. improve stocks of anti-tank weapons, artillery and naval gun ammunition. Such Improvements must, however, go hand In hand with the necessary transport and support facilities that such stocks require, and account needs to be taken of the effects of expected technological advances.

307. The European allies also play a full part in promoting worldwide

stability and Western security.   The European nations contribute on a nati

basis to UN peacekeeping forces, such as those in Cyprus and the Lebano ,

and at the request of friendly governments have also contributed to peace

keeping forces such as the Multinational Force and Observers patrolling the

border between Israel and Egypt in Sinai.   Military training assistance to

.    the European

help friendly nations help themselves is another important area.

NATO countries provide extensive training for foreign Servicemen, and loan

operation hetween th. European alllea. The United Kingdom attaches great importance to the maintenance and development of bilateral relations with its European allies, and la also playing a leading role in the work of the -lor multilateral organisation devoted to European defence cooperate.     Past year has seen the reinvigoratlon of these hodiea, a proceaa that W and our alliea intend to take forward in the coming months.

They stressed th, Torrance they attached to the Treaty&apos;a goala of strengthening peace and -onnty, ptomotl g unlty, and encouraging cooperation within Europe, and &quot;&quot;^Uned the role that the WEU could play in helping to achieve them. Ministers Pledged the significance of the  EU in promoting European defence cooperation

by agreeing normally to meet twice-yearly in future;  they also decided on a number of measures to reactivate the WEU and reform Its institutions. WEU is unique in having an Assembly specifically empowered by Treaty to discuss matters relating to the defence and security of Europe.    It thus provides a forum for European political debate about issues of major concern to us, and makes it easier to achieve a consensus on them.    It has an impor tant role in stimulating greater public debate of security issues, and In generating greater public awareness of Alliance policies.    It can act as a &apos;ginger group&apos; giving political impetus to practical work in other groups aimed at improving European defence cooperation, and assists the developme of a more unified, and thus stronger, European contribution to the Alllanc

311. In the field of cooperation in the development and procurement of

ir     olace la

defence equipment, the most significant progress in 1984 has taken p the Independent European Programme Group (IEPG), which consists of all th European members of the Alliance except Iceland.   This is considered in detail in paragraph 317.

E q u i pme.nt Collaboration

312. It has long been recognised that the Alliance as a whole, and the

European members in particular, need to make better use of the resourc

ent. DuPU&apos;

devoted to research, development and production of defence equips

to share

cation of effort is wasteful, while collaboration enables nations

ion als

ving force

helps achieve standardisation and interoperability, thereby impro


^579/3

capabUiti.s; and the savings in unit costs that cooperation can bring make It possible to buy and deploy a greater number of equipments. Furthermore,

m0 Alliance&apos;s cohesion and this kind of cooperation clearly demonstrates the alliance

its members&apos; preparedness to work affectively with one another.

MS.   Achieving affective equipment cooperation is not easy who* there are  idely differing national positions to reconcile.   Motions may be operating in different environments, with different tasks and within different force structures.   Moreover, programmes for equipment replacement may be out of &quot;ep; and national industrial, economic and political considerations always   to be borne in mind.   International machinery has been set up to encourage -operation:   thus the Conference of Motional Armament Directors CCNAD) oversea a SATO-wlde structure of specialist military armament groups and sub-

a.4   k  cppklne to harmonise  roups, whose task is to promote equipment cooperation by seeking

. rrv.-n* the IEPG seeks to make ^rational requirements between member nations, while the

b*tter use of specifically European defence procurement resources.

31*- Despite the problems, there is a creditable history of successful &quot;operation between NATO partners, going back some 20 years.   The Table

Usts those projects in which the United Kingdom has been involved. Xt Eludes some important European collaborative equipments that have been S ssfully brought into service: among them Jaguar, the Anglo-French heli-C Pters, EH70 and Tornado.   It also includes a number of projects in develop-

or m earlier study phases in which the United Kingdom is involved, altWgh m some cases decisions on our participation In full development and Pr duction remain to be taken.


LC579/3

315.    The momentum is being maintained.    In the past year there has been

further production of the Tornado aircraft with our German and Italian partne

We have agreed with France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy the

basis of work-sharing production arrangements for the Multiple-Launch Rocket

System; and with France and the Federal Republic of Germany, together wi

the United States, we have begun development in the high technology area of

terminally-guided warheads for that system.   The Anglo-Italian EH101 helicop

is now in full development.    We expect soon to make a decision on full

development of an advanced Anti-Tank Guided Weapon System (TRIGAT) with our

Italy,

French and German partners; other European nations (Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain) have asked to join the programme, and this propo has been warmly welcomed.    Norway has now joined the United Kingdom and Germany in the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile programme.   A. multi national industrial consortium is conducting feasibility studies for the NATO Frigate Replacement, working to a NATO Staff Target agreed betwee eight Alliance nations.&apos; It is encouraging, too, that Defence Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain have agreed a European Staff Target for a European Fighter Aircraft for the 1990s and beyond. Defence industries of the five countries have undertaken feasibility st in order to examine the basis for collaborative development and product and the outcome of the studies is now being evaluated.

the need

316.    These are commendable achievements, but during recent years

The growing

for more systematic and regular cooperation has become apparent.

0I1 systems

costs and technological complexity that each new generation of weap needs in order to match the steady improvements in Warsaw Pact equip111 capabilities, and the relatively limited scale of national requirement


LC579/3

m ng the European nations, mean that it is becoming ever more difficult to 6t national requirements cost-effectively from purely national programmes.

317. t

n the past year considerable progress has been made.   An increasingly lmPortant role has been played by the IEPG, which met at full Defence Minister  cor the first time in November 1984.   Ministers demonstrated their ^itical commitment to strengthening the European pillar by setting in *n a nurober of potentially far-reaching measures:

military staffs have been directed to work towards closer, harmoni-sation of operational requirements and timescales, thus allowing common equipment to be developed and procured if there are clear financial and economic advantages in so doing;

s:Lfinifleant projects are to be referred to Ministers at Staff Target stage so that international collaboration can be fully considered from the outset;

the rationalisation of research,, technological and industrial lesourppfi is to De considered.   Work is in hand to identify a number of Cooperative Technology Projects, and a study has been commissioned into ways of improving the competitiveness of the European armaments industry;

Ministers have agreed that nations should exercise greater discipline in not launching their own development projects if an appropriate  ne already exists elsewhere in Europe; that they should be readier


LC579/3

to adopt equipment already in production; and that they should be more .prepared to. apply, competition in managing European collabora tive projects.

318. What does all this mean for the United Kingdom?   Given the length of time for defence research, development and production to come to fruition reflecting the advanced nature of most defence technology - it will be som years before the full benefits of these initiatives become apparent. Never theless, if the clear objectives laid down by Defence Ministers are vigorously pursued, the savings available from greater cooperation should enable the United Kingdom to make better use of Its financial and industrial resources

to meet the equipment needs of the armed forces; and the Services themselv will be able to take advantage of greater commonality with their allies.

Resigned

319. Although cooperation means relying on equipment and components

and produced by others, this process works both ways.   The strength of th

a   in those

British defence industrial base can be maintained, and even enhanced,

sectors that respond to the incentive of greater competition by increasi g

j nmcurement

their efficiency.   There will be major challenges for Service and p&lt;^ staff and for industry, and bold decisions will need to be taken national within Europe, and by the Alliance as a whole.   The prize is, however, considerable.

, Remands

320. The renewed emphasis on European cooperation is placing growing

a we have

on the Procurement Executive (PE) of the Ministry of Defence, ana

Formerly

accordingly made changes in the PE&apos;s top management structure.

&quot;UaWation as wall as for the general Mnagement of the defence procurement P&quot;gra ,e.   m March this year the post of Chief of Defence Shipment 0,11.-Watlon was created to concentrate full-time on the pursuit of collaboration, *&gt;d to load the sustained and determined drive that will be needed over a i&gt; lod of years to bring about th. substantial Increase in cooperation that is envisaged.

 *    The European effort described above is not an alternative to transatlantic -operation:   on the contrary, a stronger and more cohesive European industry &quot;111 contribute to the strength of the alliance as a whole and enable Europe t0 cooperate more effectively on level terms with the United States. The D&quot;lted Kin.oom therefore intends to press ahead in this field with vigour Md determination.

Policies.   This chapter sets ont the capabilities, hoth structural and

403  All

 ur nuclear forces are assigned to NATO, although they remain at

all time

under the control of the British Government and are capable of

mPloyed independently when supreme national interests are at stake. Whll  they r

epresent only a relatively small proportion of the total nuclear


LC579/8

forces assigned to NATO, they are nonetheless capable of inflicting unaccep damage on a potential aggressor.    By complicating Soviet calculations abou the likely Alliance response to any aggression, British nuclear forces make a contribution to deterrence that far outweighs their numerical significan alone.

BRITISH STRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCES

404. Britain&apos;s current strategic nuclear force of four Polaris submarines

have been

provided a continuous independent deterrent since 1969. Measures

taken in recent years to ensure that this force will be effective well

the 1990s, when it will be replaced by Trident.   The programme to fit new

i SSBNs now

motors to the Polaris missiles is continuing; and all operational

deploy the improved Polaris A3TK missile system following completion of

Chevaline programme.   Chevaline is a sophisticated development designed

specifically to penetrate Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defences.

provides warheads that are hardened against the effects of ABMs, toge

multiple

with penetration aids of high complexity.    It is not, however, a

not involve

independently-targettable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) system and does any increase in the number of warheads associated with the Polar s

.     ^-i990s is

405. The programme for replacing Polaris with Trident in the mia

shipbuilding

proceeding on schedule.   A tender has been received from Vickers

a   .    ntiited Kingdom&apos;s and Engineering Ltd for the construction of the first of the unxu

t by the end

four Trident class submarines, and we hope to conclude a contra

ptitively

of the year; Vickers will be required to sub-contract work compe

j. eve r

wherever possible.   The Trident class submarines will be the larg




*ilt in th. United Kingdom; each submarine wiU have a displaced of over 15.000 tonnes, a length of about 150 metres and a maximum diameter of pressure

W a new pressurised water reactor (PWR2), which will also be used in our

, u   ^r-killer submarines.   The longer core-next class of nuclear-powered hunter-killer suo

wm.T-ina refits to be consider-of PWR2 will allow the period between submarine

a   a   &lt;HoTiif icantly increasing *&gt;ly lengthened and thus reduce the number required, significan

Tk. reactor&apos;s greater quietness &quot;suability and reducing through-life costs.   The reacto

 U1 mean that the submarine will be less vulnerable to detection itself end  ote capable of detecting others.   The Trident submarine will be fitted with

4 Hflf.antlv improved defensive newly-devel ped sonar e,uipment providing a significantly P

-NWU*. end enhancing its ability to remain undetected, the equipment  U elso have potential for further Improvement.

Slnoe the decision to opt for the 05 missile in March 1*2. the only l e in the estimated cost of the Trident programme has been that attri-k-ble to inflation and exchange rate variations.   Because of the decision

-  a our missiles in the united States rather than the United Kingdom, ^tantlal offsetting savings have been made.   At average 1984-S5 prices

-   an exchange rate of .1-38 to th. pound (the rate used, by convention, L &lt; this year&apos;s re-costing of the defence programme), the estimate is Just

- &quot;.3 billion, of which we expect about  % to be spent in this country. *  &quot;tlmated cost would have been more than 1700 million higher but for

 &gt;  issue processing decision. Trident is still expected to absorb on - M. only about 3% of the total defence budget over the period of its Procurement, and about 6% of the equipment budget.


LC579/8

407. The total value of the Trident programme to British industry, as was noted last year, will be increased by British firms&apos; obtaining sub-contrac s for the D5 weapon system under the industrial participation arrangements made with the United States in 1982.    Clearly there are difficulties in breaking into a strategic high technology programme in which United States industry is already firmly established.    But where British firms have submitte fully compliant tenders they have achieved a reasonable measure of success. The value of these awards is considerably exceeded by the potential for follow-on orders.   The full-scale engineering development phase of the Uni States programme has been under way now for some time, and we expect that

the majority of sub-contractors will have been selected by the end of 1^8

BRITISH THEATRE NUCLEAR FORCES

408. The United Kingdom also contributes a variety of nuclear weapon system

a   GRl 

to the Alliance&apos;s theatre nuclear forces.   Eight squadrons of Torna o

two squadrons of Buccaneer and one squadron of Jaguars are now operatio

in the strike/attack role in the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic

Germany, although the Jaguars will be withdrawn from the role by the e

1985 and replaced by a ninth Tornado squadron.   The prime role of thes

the BritiS&quot;

aircraft Is conventional, but they are also capable of delivering

red by Sea

free-fall nuclear bomb.   Free-fall nuclear bombs can also he delive

 fhle class

Harriers of the squadrons in service with the Royal Navy&apos;s Invinci

variety  ^

of aircraft carriers.   Nuclear depth-bombs can be dropped from a shipborne anti-submarine helicopters.




409 t

11 addition to these wholly British weapons, the United Kingdom operates

number of weapon systems for which nuclear warheads are provided by the

*ted States.   Arrangements for these weapons - whereby the United States

vides and maintains custody of the warhead, while the weapon system is owned anri

ua operated by an Alliance country - are widespread in nato and allow

0t maximum participation by the European allies in the Alliance&apos;s nuclear deterrent-

Jt posture.   For the United Kingdom, one regiment of Lance missiles and fiVe

regiments of nuclear-capable artillery are operated by the British

Army b

y based in the Federal Republic of Germany, and depth bombs are provided 0r delivery by RAF Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.

SSINJ^A^Jorce^

^^S-QLTHE UNITED KTNGDOM 4l0  Th

e forward defence of the United Kingdom derives in the first place from our fn

orces in Europe and the Eastern Atlantic; but in the last few years We have been a

devoting substantial and growing resources to the defence of

nited Kingdom itself.   This reflects our determination to rectify the Sh rtfalis in

in capability that had built up in previous years.    The protection

of 0ur ,

and must lie at the heart of our defence policy; but the importance

of defendin

g the United Kingdom goes beyond even the fundamental need to

Protect

 wn country and its people, as paragraph 204 explains. Any

Wars*w Pact a.. .

a&lt;-cack on Western Europe would almost certainly include a sub-

8tantlal air f*

offensive against the United Kingdom as well as conventional

missii0

c ts from submarines, extensive mining, and incursions by specialist


LC579/8

forces; and it is therefore in the interests of the whole Alliance that we should be capable of deterring such an offensive or, if it were launched, of defending ourselves and our territorial waters against attack.

411. The major programme of both qualitative and quantitative improvements to

our air defences, first described in detail in the 1983 Statement, is Pro

gressing satisfactorily, although it will take several more years to comple

Real benefits are already being realised.   The RAF&apos;s new air defence aire

the Tornado F2, has been accepted into service; the first aircraft were

delivered to the operational conversion unit at RAF Coningsby in late 1984,

and aircrew training is under way.    Seven F2 squadrons will be formed, and

the aircraft&apos;s excellent range and loiter capability make it ideally suit

to operations in the United Kingdom Air Defence Region.   Equipped with the

Foxhunter airborne intercept radar, the F2 will be able to locate and track

.    j. targets

multiple targets even in the most difficult environment and against

. t tactical

using electronic countermeasures; and the introduction of the Joint

Information Distribution System (JTIDS) will provide the communications to

ensure the most effective operational use of these aircraft.   Two squad

of Phantoms will remain in service after the introduction of the Tornad  

... jt remains

and improvements to the Phantom&apos;s weapon system will ensure tnat

F4J

a potent air defence aircraft in the late 1980s and 1990s.   The Phantom

aircraft bought from the United States Navy are now In squadron service,

making good the temporary shortfall in air defence aircraft immediately

f o ^

available in the United Kingdom following the deployment of Phantoms

, trainer

service In the Falkland Islands.    The programme to equip 72 HawK

aircraft with Sidewinder missiles provides a valuable enhancement to

i   t- fleet will-capability at relatively low cost.    Improvements to the tanker




W loiter time of RAF shore-based fighter greatly increase intercept range and loiter

. defence of both the home base

aircraft, thereby further enhancing the air q

and the surface fleet.

*U. The Permeation of the complex of ground radars and command, control

- communications systems for air defence, known as the-United Kingdom Mr

-i r,     npliverv of the new &quot;efence Ground Environment (UKADGE), Is progressing.

&quot;date has begun.   Better communications are also being developed. Including  *  installation of secure Ja.ing-resistant links.   Improvements to our

i.  In hand; and the Wing Headquarters, surface-to-air weapon capabilities are also in hand,

fining Pllght and first two squadrons of the Kapler Wing owned by the  **- States Mr Eorce and operated by the KAF Regiment have now formed. Tl-e first of these squadrons is now operational.

4 . We had hoped that the Nimrod Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft

j ~f 1984   but because of  &gt;uld have entered service with the RAF by the end of 1984,

-U-ems in the development of the Mission System Avionics this has not been P e,iUe.   He ara assessIng proposals for further work to complete develop-

  . and our best Judgement is that an operational Nimrod AEW capability 8   ld be achieved in 1987.   A Joint Trials Unit has been set up at RAF &quot;&apos;Wlngton, and the first production aircraft has been transferred from B tish Aerospace at Woodford.   The aim of the unit is to prove the Nimrod    astern i  a Service environment using facilities being installed at RAF Kington, and to work up engineering procedures before the aircraft is ^&quot;cuced into RAF service.   The Nimrod force will be the United Kingdom&apos;s ^ributlon to the NATO AEW mixed force; the E3-A CAWACS) element of that


LC579/8

force is already in service.    In addition, the RAF&apos;s AEW Shackletons still make a useful contribution to AEW capability and the air defence of the United Kingdom.

414. Also important to the defence of the United Kingdom is the ground defence

of vital installations against the threat of small units of specially* raine

sabotage troops.   We reported last year that plans in this area had been

revised.   United States ground defence planning for vital installations in

this country is now being integrated with our own.   Our aim is to have a

complete set of plans for the defence of vital installations in the United

-f c targets

Kingdom, both military and civil, ranging from high-priority strategi down to lower-priority installations which could be protected by static gu posts manned by members of the new Home Service Force (see paragraph

415. We also announced last year our intention to hold exercises to tes various aspects of the revised plans.   So far there have been a number

small exercises involving forces from one or two Army Districts, but in

FORWARD DEFENCE: THE EUROPEAN MAINLAND The Central Region

417. Because the Warsaw Pact would have the initiative in choosing the timing and concentration of any attack on the European mainland, NATO needs to have both strong and balanced in-place forces to deter and, if necessary, repel any attack at short notice; and the means quickly and effectively to reinforce its defences.

British Army of the Rhine

A similar sight, together with an improved warhead, has been provided for Swingfire, our long-range anti-tank missile mounted on tracked vehicles, and we have introduced an improved warhead for TOW, the anti-tank missile carrie by Lynx helicopters.   Research and development work in partnership with France and the Federal Republic of Germany is well under way on our next generation of anti-tank missiles to replace Milan, Swingfire and TOW in the 1990s.

This, coupled with the aircraft&apos;s fully-automatic ^ *apon delivery system, constitutes a major improvement in NATO&apos;s ability to  irate the  arsaw Pact&apos;s defences and hit targets behind the front line. ^ reconnaissance squadron, equipped with Tornado GR1 aircraft fitted with ^oced infra-red and video-recording equipment, will form later in the


LC579/8

decade.   Weapon delivery capability will be enhanced by the introduction of two new weapon systems - JP 233 and the Air-Launched Anti-Radiation Missile (ALARM).   Deliveries of the JP 233 cratering and area-denial weapon will begin later this year and will markedly improve the RAF&apos;s anti-airfield capability. ALARM, scheduled for delivery in the late 1980s, will provide Tornado with a corridor-clearing capability for offensive low-level missions.

427. Tornado&apos;s capability for long-range offensive operations is complement

by two squadrons of Harrier aircraft.   These versatile aircraft would be

in close support of Army ground forces and are able to operate from unprep

dispersed field sites, thus enhancing their survivability from airfield

attacks by Warsaw Pact aircraft.   In time of tension or war these squadron

would be reinforced by aircraft from the operational training unit in the

United Kingdom.    In the late    1980s the existing Harrier GR3s will be replac

in Germany by the Harrier GR5, which has a longer range and greater weapo

load than the GR3, and, like Tornado, is equipped with a full range of

electronic and other countermeasures.   For its anti-armour role the Harr

We are considering a range of options for providing a future amphibious capa bility once the existing specialised ships come to the end of their planne life.   For rapid deployment to the Northern Region we maintain the UK Mobile Force consisting of 1 Infantry Brigade, and a Logistic Support Group composed largely of TA personnel.   The Mobile Force has dedicated RAF Chinook and Puma helicopters as well as Army helicopter support.

squadrons is declared to NATO in the reconnaissance role, providing

with a much-needed increase in his highly specialised and operationally

vital reconnaissance assets.   UK-based Harriers and Tornados form a major

element in SACEUR&apos;s Strategic Reserve (Air); in addition, Jaguars are allott

AMF in the form of an infantry battalion group and force troops, armoured reconnaissance, artillery and logistic support, and rour Puma support helicopters.

MARITIME TASKS: THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND CHANNEL

432. The United Kingdom provides some 70% of the ready NATO maritime

ly routes

dedicated to the task of safeguarding the reinforcement and resupp through the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas - a huge expanse o


 r. hiB8 from the Straits of Gibraltar to bayond th. tip of Northern &quot;orvay.   Our naval and maritime air fortes can exercise sea control over selected areas of the North Atlantic Ocean and Norwegian Sea; oar amphibious forces enable us to project power ashore on the Northern Flank.   These tasks necessitate a wide range of capabilities in our ships, submarines and aircraft.

 3. In a battle for sea control a balanced fleet is essential, and each

component has its particular function.   In anti-submarine warfare US  the

r le of nuclear-powered Fleet submarines (SSNs) would ba critical: their

The new Type 2400 diesel-electric conventional Serines - the first of which, HMS Upholder, is under construction - will P-viae a powerful capability against ships and other submarines, both nuclear a^ conventional, which enter their patrol areas.   The Upholder class will -ry . weapon8 and sensor fit similar to an SSN, and will be a considerable a^ance on the Oberon and Porpoise class boats they will replace.

**  An equally important contribution to our ASW capability is made by Su ace forces, with their own sensors and weapons and their ability to 6*-cise command and control functions and carry helicopters for detection

attack.   The third Invincible class carrier, HMS Ark Royal, will be acc*Pted into the Fleet in the summer and will become operational in early 1986     This will enable us to maintain two modern carriers operational and

435. The decision announced last May to maintain up to another eight ships in the operational Fleet rather than place them in the Standby Squadron means that there will be 53 front-line destroyers and frigates in the Fleet this year and none in the Standby Squadron.   In the longer term we intend maintain a force level of about 50 destroyers and frigates.   The multi rol Type 22 frigates contain some of the most advanced ASW equipment available, and later Batch II and Batch III vessels incorporate towed arrays to give long-range, all-round, passive capability.   The last two Type 22 frigates

a class of 14 in all) were ordered this January.   The order for the first

Type 23 frigate, HMS Norfolk, was announced last October and it has been

decided to negotiate an order for the second vessel at Swan Hunter as so

orice and

as this can sensibly be done, subject to satisfactory agreement on p

other contract terms; tenders will be invited for the third Type 23 orde

f frigate

from all yards capable of carrying out the work.   The Type 23 class o

will form the backbone of the Royal Navy&apos;s ASW surface force in the year

The Type 91! can ha combined with a new four-barrelled launcher &lt; -ed on the Sea Cat mounting) to create a lightweight version of Sea wolf. Id    we announced our decision to proceed with funding the development * *is launcher project, to complete work begun as a private venture by industry.   4 vertically-launched version of Sea Wolf is being developed by   tlsh Aerospace and will be fitted to Type 23 frigates; this important Ptogramma uUl initially be worth some E250 million to British industry. ^ combat-proven Sea Bart system is being further Improved.

*  a result of lessons learnt in the Palklands conflict, we are providing Clonal point defence for major surface units.   We announced last year an Initial order for a replacement small calibre gnn for the long-service &quot;nrlikon and Bofors; this will be a single 30  cannon fitted to a stabilized     .   We intend to enhance further the anti-air defences of important ^face uarships by extending the fit of Close-in Weapon Systems.   All three ^l-ible class carriers are now fitted with the 20 mm Pnalanx.   As part of


LC579/8

the Spey/Goalkeeper reciprocal purchase package with the Netherlands, announ last year, the Royal Navy&apos;s Batch III Type 22 frigates are to be fitted with the HSA Goalkeeper.   To help counter the threat posed by sea-skimming missile we are improving our electronic warfare capability, and new systems are under development, including the NATO Sea Gnat decoy system in collaboration with the United States and Denmark.

439. To improve the integral air power of the Fleet we have ordered nine mor Sea Harriers, which will supplement the existing Carrier Air Groups embarked

1th British

in the Invincible class carriers.   We have also placed a contract wx Aerospace for a mid-life update to maintain the ability of the Sea Harrier counter the threat until about the end of the century.   The aircraft will fitted with a new radar and will be capable of carrying the Advanced Med urn Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).   The Sea Harrier update programme will be Introduced by the end of the decade.

replacement of Phantoms by Tornado F2s, described in paragraph 411. will enhance shore-based air defence.

443. The modernisation of the Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft to Mark 2 standard is due to be completed this year, and further system enhancements are in hand to ensure that the aircraft keeps pace with developments in Soviet submarine design.   The aircraft are capable of delivering the new Sting Ray anti-submarine torpedoes and are being modified to carry Harpoon anti-ship missiles.   To complement these improvements the Nimrod simulators are being replaced, and new computerised mission support systems are be ng built to process the mass of information brought back by the aircraft.

The vital part that amphibious forces can play in reinforcement and

ntervention operations both in and out of area is well understood

nationally and within NATO.   As noted in paragraph 430, options for the f u t

ure Provision of these capabilities are being studied. ^RESERVES

Our volunteer reserve forces make a crucial and cost-effective contribution^

448. The Home Service Force (HSF), which we aim to expand initially to a strength of about 5,000, has an important part to play in our plans for home defence.   It, will provide guard forces for lower-priority potential targe

in time of tension or war, thus releasing more highly trained units for other tasks.   We plan to raise 43 new companies and are already recruiting for most of them.   Although the majority are to be hosted by TA units, fiv will have Regular Army units as hosts.   Depending on the success of the initial expansion, we shall consider further expanding the HSF in the long term.

BEYOND THE NATO AREA

452. We have already described, in Chapter 2, our approach to the interests and commitments we retain in the wider world beyond the NATO area. Despite the retrenchment that has taken place in our overseas military presence in recent decades and the Increasing concentration of our defence resources within the NATO area, our out-of-area defence involvement remains substanti Figure 4 (pages [      ] and [      ]) illustrates the deployment of our armed f  around the world in early 1985.   In addition to these deployed units, indivi Servicemen were assigned on loan outside the NATO area, helping the armed forces of friendly countries to provide for their own long-term security needs.    In the Gulf, an area of particular strategic importance for the United Kingdom and the West as a whole, nearly 400 British Servicemen were working in every littoral state except Iraq and Iran.   Such assistance

,     -ftself, in

is complemented by the training we provide in the United Kingdom

1983-84 some 3,700 students from over 70 non-NATO countries attended cours

at British defence establishments.   More details are given on page [  

453. These links with friendly armed forces are reinforced by the cont

established and maintained by our programme of overseas deployments

exercises.   During the past year, we have maintained our naval prese

-I st merchant

the Arabian Sea.   Although our ships are there primarily to assis

shipping in the Gulf, they have taken the opportunity to pay a se

successful visits to countries in the region.   We have also maintains

guardship in the Caribbean; and whenever possible Royal Navy forces

participated outside the NATO area in exercises with allied and

455. By undertaking these wide-ranging and diverse defence activities aroun

the world, we make an important contribution to the maintenance of inter

national peace and stability.   But we must recognise that, despite our bes

efforts and those of our friends and allies, deterrence can fail and situa

tions arise in which we have no option but to intervene militarily to defe

our legitimate interests.   We described in last year&apos;s Statement the importa

steps that we have taken to enhance the capability of British forces to

, effectiveness

undertake operations in more distant theatres.   One key to tne

of military action overseas is the ability to extend the range and enduran

of shore-based aircraft; we have therefore paid particular attention to

our capacity for air-to-air refuelling.   In addition to enhancing our tan

fleet, we are considering a replacement programme for the Victor tanker

a 1960s, will

force.   These aircraft, which have been in service since the mid-  

reach the end of their useful lives in the early 1990s; as a first stage

the replacement programme, three Tristar 500s have been bougnc

American Airlines.   The enhancements to 5 Airborne Brigade&apos;s capabilitie

arly complete&apos;

for out-of-area operations, announced in November 1983, are now n when the programme to equip a number of Hercules with station-keeping

fVifir with

radars is completed in early 1986, a parachute battalion, togetn elements of the brigade&apos;s headquarters and a full range of supporting

ve A

and services, will be capable of being dropped in a single assault second parachute battalion group is now trained and equipped to this role.

456. Our capability to operate wherever in the world may be necessa

thus being steadily enhanced.   The two most notable operations und

mounted f r

our armed forces beyond the NATO area in the past year have been

^HHANT_ HIPPING

*     The United Kingdom&apos;s Merchant Navy is a vital defence resource and as 8U&lt;* Plays an important role in our planning.   We collaborate closely ^ the Department of Transport in monitoring the availability of the ShiPs needed for military purposes.   Today, with the exception of large


LC579/1

deep-sea trawlers for MCM operations, there are sufficient ships in each category to meet our defence needs.   The Table [below] illustrates trends in the availability of shipping required for defence purposes.

2. Not all ships included are necessarily suitable for defence purpos

459.   The demise of the United Kingdom&apos;s distant water fishing fleet has caused a shortfall in the number of trawlers suitable for MCM purposes. Studies are in hand to identify other ways of fulfilling the role.


  .   Our   0 obligations, both for th. reinforcement of Europe end in -PPort of Royal Navy operationa, require the use of merchant ships of a wide  n.ty of types.   The recent decline in the overall size of the United Kingdom&apos;s merchant fleet hes had differing effecta upon the various types of &quot;*sels needed for defence purposes.   It is of concern that, if the decline &quot;ntinues for several more yeara at the present rate, it could become ^reasingly difficult for us to discharge at least some of our NATO obligees.   The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Ministry of  ^e ca, haa therefore commissioned consultants to undertake a major study &apos;&quot;0 the future trends of availability in those parts of the merchant fleet  &quot; which there la a defence need.   The study began In December 1984, and &quot;suit, are expected to be available by the middle of this year. The ^Plications for defence, and any consequential action that may be needed, Wil1 then be carefully considered.


Warsaw Pact merchant and fishing fleets

The Warsaw Pact merchant and fishing fleets exist primarily for commercial reasons.   The merchant fleets carry Warsaw Pact exports and imports, participate to a limited degree in cross-trading, and deliver militarv an(* economic aid to the Third World.   Potential military requirements are, however, taken into account in the design and construction of almost all

Warsaw Pact vessels, and they are routinely used for military purposes an

ontri1 

intelligence gathering.   They therefore make a significant additional con bution to the Warsaw Pact&apos;s military capability.

The total strengths 1 of the NATO and Warsaw Pact merchant and fishing fleets in 1984 were as follows:

	Number of Ships 2	Gross Registered Tons

NATO of which UK 3	8279 948	127,767,538 15,325,398

as this, over 3,000 individual reservists.   27,000 troops moved by air and

23,000, plus 9,000 vehicles, crossed the Channel by sea and moved up the

lines of communication through the Low Countries to BAOR.   Inevitably some

delays were experienced, mainly as a result of weather conditions, but th

effect was much the same as might be expected during transition to war,

it was therefore a notable achievement that all the necessary rem* were moved to BAOR within the required timescale.

the cost of the exercise, estimated at over  30 million, could have been better spent elsewhere.   But in addition to the invaluable military benefits we have gained through LIONHEART, we have also demonstrated not only our commitment to the defence of Europe but also our ability, in practice, to fulfil that commitment.

I MILITARY ASSISTANCE OVERSEAS

I Promote British defence and foreign policy interests outside the NATO area.

k, ni  uttle attention is | I 0- important component that has attracted comparatively little

I Although the Government does not operate |

I  *r military assistance programme.   Although tne

Much of this assistance I    -sde available on repayment, but In many cases it is subsidised by the I

1 British Government.

I

I &gt;&gt; ffnrr has been growing steadily in

1 2&apos;    The scale of our military assistance effort has

I r v 1 000 Servicemen either on loan to

I recent years.   In total we have well over 1,000 berv

I i J      ~f fnrpism and Commonwealth

1   orseas countries or undertaking the training of foreign

1  s, fr0m over 70 non-NATO countries, at Service establishments in tba

1  ^ed kin8dom.   Service personnel are currently on loan to some 30 countries

1   territories overseas; and expert teams pay numerous short-term advisory I visits.

I

1 3&apos;    The nature and type of assistance varies widely.   For British loan 1 S  Personnel - who are all volunteers - the numbers. involved range from


LC581/8

nearly 200 from all three Services in the case of Oman, to single individuals

in a few countries.    Sometimes the personnel are integrated in the armed

forces of the country concerned - in Belize, Brunei and Oman, for example,

we provide the Commander of the armed forces as well as a number or

operational and command appointments.   More typically, however, we provide

self-contained advisory teams, which concentrate on the development of  ne

more aspects of military organisation or training.   Again, these teams vary

considerably in size and in the scope of their activities.   One particu

larly ambitious and successful example is the British Military Advisory and

Training Team in Zimbabwe, which originally numbered well over 100 and is

present about 50 strong.   Since independence this team has been helping

build up an efficient, disciplined and unified national army by bringing

together the separately organised armed groupings that had been involve

years of bitter internal conflict.   The British team&apos;s success is illuS

t to take |

trated by the fact that it has been asked by the Zimbabwe Governmen

training

on several new training tasks, and is now the only foreign military

team remaining in the country.   A similar effort is being undertaken by

smaller British team in Uganda, another African country trying to rebui

itself after a crippling civil war.    Inevitably the problems facing

adily raising|

countries in such circumstances are great, and the process of ste

standards of training and organisation slow.    But the British Service

,   tne estab- I

concerned can be proud of the contribution they are making towar lishment of self-sufficient, well-disciplined forces capable of playlng positive role in their countries&apos; security.  


^581/8

Numerous smaller British Service teams have been making notable contri- |

tions to the enhancement of stability in many parts of the world. During

the iaaf. i ac year, an Army team of four has been helping to establish the new

 bian Army: the passing-out parade for the first intake of recruits took

Place in November 1984.   A tri-Service team of three officers has established

first Staff College in Bangladesh with such success that they have been

e&lt;* to stay for a further two years.   A team of seven Royal Navy personnel

Deen in Barbados for the last four years providing expertise in setting

&apos; atl dually w-M

I iae spectrum of subjects, and ranges from the prestigious high-

el cour

, Ses at the Royal College of Defence Studies and the Staff Colleges,

at Which th

I re is always a very great demand for places; to courses involving

8hl? techni i

, cal skills such as advanced engineering and electronics; and to


LC581/8

others teaching some of the more fundamental skills, such as the International Midshipman&apos;s Course at Dartmouth and basic flying training courses. To ensure that foreign students are able to gain the maximum benefit from their training here, special English language courses are also arranged at the Defence School of Languages in Beaconsfield.   Places on our training courses are generally provided on an opportunity basis intended to make full use any spare capacity beyond that required for our own students. Military training, particularly when it involves advanced equipment and intensive

But

instruction by highly qualified specialists, is an expensive business, the quality of the training provided by our establishments is such that the places available for overseas students on many courses are heavily over subscribed.

6.     Our military assistance programme thus involves British Service per

in a wide range of activities covering a large number of countries. But

there are several important common features.   The most important is that

our programmes aim to help our friends and allies outside NATO to develop

the capability of their forces, both to maintain their own security and

contribute to regional stability.    Ultimately the aim is to develop the

f.-gupporting* I

skills of the forces concerned to the point where they become sen

.    size of I

This is illustrated by the fact that we have felt able to reduce tne

nd Zimbabwe.I

three of our largest loan Service teams, those in Brunei, Kuwait a

A second common feature Is the relatively low cost to the United Kingd

ost of  ur &apos;

our military assistance programme:   for example, some 80% of the c

loan service assistance is met by the countries we are helping. Final

.strengthening I

quite apart from the benefits gained by the United Kingdom from su

jn erests,

peace and stability in areas of the world where we have direct i


LC581/8

assistance provided by our Service personnel is very much appreciated -indeed there is often a greater demand than we can meet - and thus makes an Want contribution to fostering good relations with the governments of the countries concerned.

These figures, which are provisional, have been compiled from NATO sources except for the UK and where indicated. Total expenditure and per capita figures are based on 1984 average market exchange rates and reflect the strength of the dollar over this period. Market exchange rates do not necessarily reflect the relative purchasing power of individual currencies and so are not a complete guide to comparative resource allocation.

With the ending in 1985-86 of the commitment to plan for annual real    wth in the region of 3%, there have been suggestions that it will not be ie to sustain the improvements in our defence capabilities. This kes no account of the continuing impact of the substantial real increase in defence spending between 1978-79 and 1985-86; nor of the significant improve-ts in efficiency which have ensured, and will continue to ensure, that output is bought for a given cash input.    It will certainly be necessary

tO   plan r-i

flexibly to match the forward programme to the available cash and to

make

PPropriate provision for contingencies.    But the forward programme

Id not be seen as a rigid-plan stretching ten years ahead, establishing

ni-s In detail to exact equipment numbers with specified in-service dates,    y.

is in practice continually being adjusted for a range of reasons, ^ing technological and industrial constraints and opportunities, as

Well

as budgetary limitations.   The annual re-costing of forward defence Plans, rei

       ated to assumptions endorsed for costing purposes only, permits neces8arv *a&lt;

j adjustments to be made progressively in the light of reappraised retJuirementQ

Ls or other new developments.    It also provides a basic framework

^i thi n

which Ministers can authorise expenditure commitments, with confidence that the

Se can be discharged within the future resources expected to be

liable for a c

r defence.    Programme adjustment is a continuing process, in

Whi&lt;* the 8tr,  

&lt;-cict control of forward commitment helps to maintain flexibility.

Managed i

n this way, the increases in the defence budget since 1978-79 Pr vide the rQ

resources to sustain the defence roles identified in Cmnd 8288

ln the moat n

oat cost-effective manner.

504.

ementing the increased resources being made available to defence

are 0ur

c nstant efforts to maximise their output through greater efficiency


LC577/5

and value for money.    As Figure 8 shows, the proportion of the defence budge

spent on equipment has risen from 40% In 1978-79 to 46% in 1985-86. Extended

use of competition in the placing of defence contracts should compound the

effect of these steady increases, and the renewed emphasis we are giving to

collaboration with our European allies (see Chapter 3) holds out the prospec

of worthwhile economies in equipment procurement.   In recent years we have

spent about 15% of our equipment budget collaboratively (see Figure 5).

Similarly, the measures we are taking to transfer personnel from the suppo

nf available

areas to the front line will contribute to the more effective use oj-resources.   These developments are described in greater detail later in chapter.

THE EFFICIENCY PROGRAMME

ant Infortna-

505. As we explained in last year&apos;s Statement, MINIS (The Management-

&lt; nrogramme tion System for Ministers and top management) is at the heart of our

for improving efficiency.   MINIS has now been in progress for two years

the Ministry of Defence, and its coverage has been extended to include

ber of

headquarters of front-line Commands; the result is that the total n MINIS senior officers (those responsible for efficiency across individua management areas) has risen from 156 last year to 190 this year.

506. We have also extended the coverage of Staff Responsibility Budg

(SRBs), which were introduced for civilians on 1 April 1984, to military

introducing

personnel, in the support areas from 1 April 1985; and we are import manage&quot;

Executive Responsibility Budgets (ERBs) into a large number of supp

o 300 units and

ment areas over the next three years.   ERBs will involve some -&gt;

establishments in the United Kingdom with annual operating costs of over  3

biUion.   The activities covered include supply and repair, medical services,

the individual training of Service personnel, and research and development.

^th SRBS and ERBs&gt; operated within the framework of MINIS, will increasingly

Decome the vehicles for securing yearly improvements in value for money,

Principally by enhancing the accountability of individual managers, and by

Elating the resources that their activities consume to the output that they Produce.

507    The first round of MINIS in 1983-84 showed the need for a restructuring of the higher organisation for defence.   The principles of this reorganisation were set out in last year&apos;s Statement and, subsequently, in The Central ^^gation for DgfpnrP (Cmnd 9315).   The new structure came into effect, as Planned, on 2 January 1985 and has now been operating successfully for several months,   it is designed to provide, on the one hand, for stronger Antral control of defence policy, operations and resources (including manpower)

and  on the other, for decentralisation to the Services and the Procurement

Executive (vv\   f J

of day-to-day management.

508. tv,

ine centralised PE structure, established in 1972, remains basically

Und  although a review recently undertaken within the Ministry, in which iridu8trv v.

y has been involved, has confirmed that some improvements should be

Sought i

n the way procurement is conducted, so as to obtain best value for money Ml

ministers will be involved earlier in equipment decisions and in

Proj6ct

strategy, particularly with an eye to increasing international colla-

borati

 n*   A-s the threat we face becomes more sophisticated, and as a conse-qUence th

ne real cost of equipment continues to rise, it will be more important

I


LC577/5

than ever for the United Kingdom to collaborate with its allies to develop and produce equipment.   This has led to the creation of the new post of Chief of Defence Equipment Collaboration, discussed in Chapter 3, which has been filled by the former Chief of Defence Procurement, Mr David Perry. Mr Peter Levene, the former chairman of United Scientific Holdings pic, haS been appointed to succeed him as Chief of Defence Procurement.

Competition

509. Competition in the supply of goods and services to the armed forces lies at the heart of our procurement policy.   The initiatives for competit

 pf rf over the

launched at the end of 1983 have been progressively put into erreci. past year, and it remains our firm objective to secure competitive propo

ticable and

both for main contracts and for sub-contracts wherever it is pract reasonable to do so.   Our competition policy also has substantial en for the international competitiveness of British industry.

510. When account is taken of competitive sub-contract purchases unde

.    j following

competitive main contracts, over 60% of new contracts are pricea competition or by other reference to market forces.   A full analysis contracts placed is given in Table 2.11 in Volume 2.   The introduction of competition into areas where previously it did not always apply naS ^ worthwhile savings.   But, of course, the policy must be a long-term view of the complexity of much of the equipment we purchase.


5U. Th

nere have been some notable successes both In achieving greater value money arid ^n &apos;introducing new companies to the field, as the following 6XamPles show:

: f Uowing competition for production of a B^^f^,^^ the order was split between two companies, with a erall saving to the Army.


- we have held a major and successful competition for the production

of a new basic trainer aircraft for the RAF.    Following the receipt of

best and final offers from all four industrial partnerships in the

competition, we have chosen the Tucano proposed by Short Brothers,

.       o clear

association with Embraer of Brazil, which was the cheapest oy margin.   Subject to the completion of contractual negotiations, we

intend to order 130 aircraft.   The cost is approximately  6  million&apos;

f Defence&apos;s

or 35% less than that originally envisaged in the Ministry or forward costing process.

.  .     are being

512. Further measures to improve the effectiveness of competiti

introduced.   Major contracts and Invitations to tender now contain a con

. . .  Mq sub-contracting requiring the main contractor to report the extent to wnicn wb

f the first-of~

plans involve the use of competition: for example, in the case o

nlies will

class Type 23 frigate, some 76% by value of sub-contracts and supp

be purchased by competition.   Wherever practicable we are extending

r Project

number of contractors invited to tender for our requirements.

art ih helPing

of enterprise and willingness to innovate are playing a vital Pa




0 obtain the best long-term value for money.   Our competition policy is

ating extra opportunities in which small firms can share.    This applies

Ocularly at the sub-contract level - the most fruitful area for small

rs&gt; and in which prime contractors are encouraged to use competition

widely as possible.   Over 40,000 copies of our highly successful booklet ^llin

&quot;--S-_to the MOD have been distributed to the smaller firms for which it

was desi

gned, and there has been an encouraging increase in enquiries since

its puhl

ication.   Of particular assistance to small firms has been the increasp f

rrom  5,000 to  10,000 of the threshold below which many types of

contract

can be awarded without firms being made subject to the approval and

^ality a

ssurance procedures required for larger orders. n integral part of the drive to increase competition is the principle

of corit

Ul,tracting

out support services to the private sector wherever this can

be done witv. .

Lnout operational detriment or disadvantage to the taxpayer.

Durlng th

e last few years over 95% of all accommodation cleaning and laundry has  een c

ontracted out.    Other services such as catering, labouring and

ePing are being examined.   Technical functions are also being c ntracted

out, including aircraft servicing, air traffic control and the

Pr ducti0n

^ or technical publications.   We have decided to use civilian

8 Scn ols for the training of the majority of RAF tradesmen drivers; and we hav

e invited competitive tenders for the supply of support services

at the Pro

and Experimental Establishment, Shoeburyness, as the first

8tage of a n

Programme to contract out a large part of the day-to-day support

actinties

at all the Proof and Experimental Establishments.


LC577/5

515. In addition to contracting out individual functions, we are paying increasing attention to the scope for putting out to contract discrete manag raent units.    The physical aspects of the defence accommodation stores task at RAF Quedgeley, and the air publications and forms warehousing at Woolwich, were contracted out in 1984; and a number of other proposals, including the day-to-day operation of the PE Stores Depot at Aston Down, are being examine As a rule, contracts are let and renewed on a competitive basis to ensure that the Ministry is able to secure the best possible service at the lowest possible price.

Rationalisation of Support

516. The object of our efficiency programme is not just to save money.

central feature is our drive to get a higher proportion of Servicemen

      -v,&quot;     We have

the front line: to switch resources from the &quot;tail&quot; to the   teecn . therefore been conducting a major overhaul of support activities in al three Services, with the joint aims of strengthening the front line an achieving for the taxpayer better value for money.

517. The Royal Navy has moved both manpower and other resources fronl s pp

. iast year,

areas to the front line.    It is committed to the aim, announced

r devoted

of a 25% reduction between 1981 and 1988 in the uniformed manpowei

to shore support, and by 1 April 1985 numbers had already fallen by

m, 11,000 from

By the early 1990s total naval manpower is planned to reduce oy

and studies

the 1981 figure; some 6,400 savings have, already been decided upo ,

are in hand to identify the remainder.   Many other ways of using tnanp

tn of time

more efficiently are being examined, Including increasing the e


LC57775

Post, putting certain tasks out to contract, reducing the provision made

to

cover for sickness and leave, and investing in automation and mechanisa-

i0n&apos; for instance, the modernisation of the Naval Shore Telegraph Network is

Pected to produce a significant reduction in communications personnel.

518

Every effort is made to ensure that ships, submarines and aircraft are  Perated

u&gt; maintained and updated in the most effective possible manner, and

that th

e most economic balance is struck between sea, shore training and SuPport u

    we have been considering the arrangements under which the Royal Dockyard

as at Devonport and Rosyth should be managed in the future to enable

them to

meet the Royal Navy&apos;s needs in the most cost-effective manner. No s involving major change will be taken until a period of consultation

has kbo

een completed.

519. A  

good housekeeping&quot; approach is pursued in all support areas. The

size and

composition of Fleet Maintenance Groups, for example, are re-

apPraiSed

regularly to ensure that they are economical in naval manpower but Provide adP

^equate support for vessels that increasingly have smaller ships&apos; ComPanies.

A firm of management consultants has conducted a study into support for naval aircraft to ensure maximum cost-effectiveness,

atld we are

considering their recommendations.    In addition, rationalisation

 f storea h

handling will make it possible to close the Royal Naval Store Hots at n

UePtford later this year; and at Woolston in 1986.

raining is being rationalised and concentrated in a number of

r


LC577/5

key establishments, where possible on a tri-Service basis, and the total number of shore establishments is being steadily reduced - HMS Pembroke and HMS Fisgard closed in 1984, and we plan to close HMS Caledonia by the end of 1985.   Further studies are under way into the most cost-effective disposition of training activities and accommodation in the Portsmouth area.   In all this we constantly aim, of course, to maintain satisfactory standards of training and support, and to ensure that a naval career remains attractive to people of the high quality we need.

521.   In last year&apos;s Statement we announced a series of studies to effect

redeployment of manpower from the training and support areas in the Army

the front line.   The studies, collectively entitled &quot;Exercise LEAN LOOK ,

.    ii-o-ii&quot; which

are now complete, and have identified some 4,000 posts in the taix could be redeployed.   The main ways of achieving these savings are.

- contracting out administrative transport, such as staff cars, va

eds - and

and coaches - which support peacetime, rather than wartime n the reduction of associated posts;

525. The main change will involve the position of the Arms Directors, whose functions in the policy area are to provide special-to-arm advice and, in management and executive areas, to be the focus for the Regimental system

to supervise professional standards and training activities.   The Arms Directors will now report to the Commander   Training Establishments, re titled &quot;Commander Training and Arms Directors&quot;, not only as before in respe of their training responsibilities, but also for their specialist contribu tions to the policy work, of the General and Defence Staffs.

LC577/5

ensuring that defence equipment purchased for the Services is fit for the

job.    The new directors have functional responsibilities, and include a

director to handle the interface with industry.    The change will produce more

consistency in QA policy and procedures and better use of QA manpower and

facilities; it will also increase the involvement of QA staff at the earliest

points in the procurement cycle, especially for major equipments. In

addition, more of industry will be encouraged to take greater responsibility

for the quality and reliability of its products, in keeping with the alrea y

widely established policy that main contractors are generally required to

comply with relevant defence standards in the 05-20 series and are fully

responsible for the quality of the work of sub-contractors.   This policy

CIVILIAN MANPOWER

530.    Since 1979, the Ministry of Defence has reduced its United Kingdom

- lncaiiy-en8aged

based civilian numbers by more than 73,000 and its numbers ot J-01-&quot;

  Hlian manpower

civilians overseas by some 5,000.    The further reductions in civi

with the aim

planned up to 1 April 1988 are on course; indeed, in accordance w of increasing the rate of rundown, larger reductions than originally

Hi fiVsd ^

are foreseen, and the target of 174,700 for 1 April 1986 has been ac

169,000.

year early.    The UK-based manpower target for 1 April 1988 is now

o-third of

By that time, the Ministry of Defence will have shed almost one

defence sales in 1985-86 will be about  2.5 billion.   This is a significant contribution to Britain&apos;s total exports and sustains some 130,000 jobs.

534. The Defence Sales Organisation again arranged the British Army Equipment Exhibition at Aldershot in 1984: one of the biggest exhibitions of its type in the world.   Later in the year the Farnborough Air Show, sponsored by the Society of British Aerospace Companies, was a major success and included substantial amount of British defence equipment.   Preparations are now wel under way for the next Royal Navy Equipment Exhibition to be held at HMS Excellent, Portsmouth, in September 1985.   These exhibitions provide a very attractive shop window for the entire range of modern defence equipment produced by British manufacturers.

DEFENCE RESEARCH

535. Some  383 million (of which  229 million is intramural) - about of the defence budget - is expected to be spent on defence research in 1985-86.   Virtually all subsequent design, development and production of defence equipment is carried out in industry with support, as necessa y&gt; from the Research Establishments.   As recommended in the 1980 Strathcon Report, we are seeking further opportunities to devolve the residue

and development work to industry and to concentrate the resources of establishments on longer-term innovative research and selective supp  concepts and projects.

539.    Once the Ordnance Factories and Military Services Act 1984 had received Royal Assent on 31 October 1984, we were able to use the powers it conferred to complete the transformation and vest the assets, rights and liabilities associated with the ROFs in a new company, known as Royal Ordnance pic, on 2 January 1985.   The company, whose shares are for the time being wholly owned by the Secretary of State, now operates on a fully commercial basis in the same way as any other company.    18,967 staff have been transferred outside the Civil Service.   We intend to press ahead with the introduction of private capital into Royal Ordnance pic as soon as possible, but the method and timing have not yet been decided.

3  are seven establishments occupying some 20 major sites and a I

of minor ones.   The main locations of the establishments, together | with- their priory activities, are as follows:

4. Our establishments employ some 23,000 staff, over half of whom are non-industrials, the majority of these being scientists and engineers. This compares with an intramural workforce of 34,000 in 1971.   The significant reduction has been achieved in a number of ways, including the transfer of design and development work to industry and the contracting-out of support tasks, such as the operation of ranges and the provision of equipment servicing.   This is a continuing process, by which the Research Establish

ments are both contributing to the Government&apos;s policy of reducing the size

infiely in

of the Civil Service and at the same time involving industry more cxo  defence technologies and programmes.

5. The defence research programme is not planned and managed in isolati from other relevant skills and facilities.   To avoid unnecessary duplicatio of effort our scientists exchange research findings with their counterpa

in a number of other countries under Information Exchange Programmes, in

which care is taken to ensure a fair balance so that British industry do

not lose the benefits of research undertaken in this country.   We are

increasingly seeking to involve industry In the planning of our rese

fer to the

programme, in the promotion of civil applications, and in the tran

nts. And

civil sector of technologies generated at our Research Establisnme

the Research Establishments already carry out some work with a princiP

tablisnmentS

civil aim.   Wherever possible, within resource limitations, the es make available their staff and facilities to other Government Departme

f Trade and

industry on a repayment basis.    For example, the Department or

1 program063

Industry currently spends almost  25 million a year on intramura at the Research Establishments.


LC590/3

As examples of these trends: |

We have invited seven industrialists to participate in an advisory r le in our Headquarters Management Board for the research programme, and we hope in due course to extend similar arrangements to our major

Research Establishments; |

We have assisted in the setting up of Defence Technology Enterprises

Ltd I   a private company whose object is to help identify potentially

marketable ideas and technologies generated in the establishments and

to Promote their exploitation by the civil sector; |

We are examining the practicability of establishing a partnership with |

industry in the field of marine technology, the basic concept of which |

nvolves initially the operation of Ministry of Defence facilities by | industrial partner, both for defence purposes and on a private venture |

asis, and the progressive transfer by the Ministry of expertise in |

CHAPTER ST*. THE SERVICE? fc D THE COMMUNITY

  ~f t-he armed forces as a uni- 1.   It is tempting to see the men and women of the

        .heir fellow citizens by their vocation and by formed elite, separated from their fellow c

of deterrence and defence which they are called the seriousness of the tasks of deterrem.

* .-hat they are both drawn from, and    on to perform.   But this is to forget that they

ThPv bring to the armed forces the ^main members of, the wider community. They

&apos;.Unt, an. abilities which they have learnt in anhoola and universities; -  han their time in the Services ia over they bring back to the civil

it, the skills, disciplines and loyalty that have characterised the r Service careers.

. for Army regiments - the Service man t0&quot;ns, the traditional recruiting areas for Army s

  -an as a citiaen is a familiar part of everyday life.   But in other

&lt;-        disasters force them to *  media, on ceremonial occasions, or when natural disaste

 U on the Services for assistance.   This chapter gives details of the main

** Performed hy the Services on Behalf of the civil community during the

-  veer, whether in helping with non-military projects, in responding to

Sendee, or in aasisting the civil authorities to maintain law and

0rder in Northern Ireland.

^jtary_ Ald tn fhp Civj1 community

^ery year the Services put their specialist skills to work on non-Projects for the Benefit of local communities.   The range of activ-


LC579/2

ities is wide but does not change greatly from year to year; the essential requirements are simply that the tasks should have training benefit for t e personnel involved and should be of social value.    In 1984, for example, Royal Naval units gave swimming instruction at a number of schools. And during the summer the Army provided a number of administrative staff t0 run a 12-week working camp for over 300 young people taking part in a Prince s Trust project:   under the guidance of military experts, the young people carried out several construction and restoration tasks for the National Trust development of the pre-Roman archaeological site at Badbury Rings&gt; in Dorset.   A similar, smaller-scale project is planned for 1985.   The Army also taken part in such diverse activities as building footbridges, making footpaths, and assisting the police in searching for missing children.

604. Service assistance was also provided to alleviate distress caused by

natural disasters or major accidents.    During the extremely dry weather

early May last year, over 450 Army and RAF personnel helped local fire br g

,       fhe heavy

and the Forestry Commission to fight forest fires in Wales; and in

snowfalls that covered the country in the New Year, Servicemen gave assis

- r the &quot;meals

in many ways, including the provision of vehicles and drivers ror on wheels&quot; service.

Mlc attention

605. Outside the United Kingdom, the task that attracted most pudxj.

during 1984-85 was the Service assistance in famine relief operations in

Ethiopia, codenamed Operation BUSHELL.   Within a week of being called upon

nd five

last autumn, a detachment of two RAF Hercules aircraft with 60 RAF an

detachment

Army personnel was established in Addis Ababa - the first foreign


LC579/2

to .  op operations.   The aircraft were to provide help la moving the large amount of relief aid arriving in the country to the areas of greatest immediate -eed.   I  this operation the British team flew several sorties a day, seven     a week, air-lifting relief cargo (including food, medical supplies, tents, hlankets and other items such as trucks and spare parts) from Addis Ahaba or the port of Assab to famine-stricken areas in the north and north --St of the country.   The operation retired extensive use of rough landing &quot;rips ta formidable terrain located over 7,000 feet above sea level; this tepresented a demanding test of crew .kill, and aircraft durability. Hever-*ele.s the detachment succeeded in air-landing 14.5 million lb of cargo   lng the first three months.   At the start of the fourth month, and before    onset of the wet season, one of the two Hercules began air-dropping &quot;Uef aupplle3,  lylng up to three sorties daily.    e HAP aircrews, supple- a ed by 12 ^ air despatch personnel, faced a daunting challenge in &quot;t-dropplag supplies from 50 feet on mountainous dropping .ones located up

^Uvery cabled the detachment to provide 1 million lb of relief supplies    Particularly remote and inaccessible communities.   Throughout the operation *   titish detachment was supported by a weekly Hercules resupply flight ft   the United Kingdom carrying aircraft spares, replacement craws and  tk  aouipment, as well as additional relief supplies whan space permitted. *  apeed and efficiency of the British team&apos;s contribution has won widespread &quot;aise  rom relle  organisations and the Ethiopian Government.


LC579/2

Northern Ireland

606. The task of assisting the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to enforce the rule of law in Northern Ireland makes unique demands on our armed forces. It is now over 15 years since the Army were first used in the Province in the counter-terrorist role, and during that time the courage, restraint an skill that they have shown, day in and day out, have won widespread admiration

607. Every year sees further progress on the road back to normality&apos; The

RUC are now firmly in charge of operations against terrorist crime, and as

they grow in strength and capability so the support they require from t e

Army lessens.   But the time when the RUC can operate without any military

support is still some way off, and until it is reached the Army will still

needed.    During the last year Army units have been involved in some notabl

successes involving the capture of terrorists and the recovery of guns and

,q Hoy 1984, in

explosives.   Following an ambush by terrorists near Forkhill on i=&gt; &apos;

s arrested

which one member of a military foot patrol was wounded, one suspect

cts were

and two guns and some ammunition recovered.   Subsequently two more su

curity forces

arrested in connection with the incident, one by members of the sec of the Irish Republic.   One of the most notable finds of explosives in 19 occurred when a joint RUC/military search team located a bomb factory an recovered 66 bags of home-made explosives and other bomb-making equips

608.   The price has been high: 527 soldiers lost their lives between 1969

and the end of 1984, and even during last year there were 19 dead and

the Ulster

injured.   Ten of the dead and 22 of the injured were soldiers from

11 supp0^^

Defence Regiment (UDR), who play an invaluable part in the overall


LC579/2

0 the RUC.   Two of the worst incidents resulting in loss of life of members

the armed forces during 1984 were the booby-trap bomb which exploded betieafVi *u

&quot;-n the van of off-duty soldiers participating in an international Ashing competition at Enniskillen on 18 May, and a land-mine explosion near astlederg on 14 July.   The former killed two soldiers instantly and very riously injured two others; one subsequently died from his injuries. The tter killed two UDR soldiers, one a woman corporal, and seriously injured another a

r*   Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) experts responded to 702 calia f

for assistance during 1984 and successfully neutralised 2774 kg of

Plosive.   Service in Northern Ireland has again been recognised with a dumber nf

or gallantry awards, including a George Medal, 20 Queen&apos;s Gallantry

Medais

and a Bar to a Queen&apos;s Gallantry Medal.   mb DiST,rt  .

609. T,

e various skills in bomb disposal and in searching for explosive

devices

that the Army has developed in Northern Ireland are available for U8e in Gr

feat Britain if required.   Army, Royal Navy and RAF EOD teams in Britain have responded during the last year to over 750 calls for

assist

Ce in dealing with unexploded weapons from the Second World War atld earn

er    The most notable was in Sheffield in February when the Royal El&gt;gineer3 B

were called upon to dispose of a Second World War 1,000 kg Hermann

b mb dis

 vered on a building site.   The sappers spent 46 hours at the site W rking in ,

freezing temperatures to make the bomb safe, while residents from

the Su

r unding hous es were evacuated, and Sheffield United&apos;s home football

&quot;atCh to Vi

LO oe postponed.   Damage was limited to a few broken windows when fuz* was ki

dS blown at the end of the operation.    In the light of the


LC579/2

Hoddinott   Report on the bombing at the Grand Hotel, Brighton, in October 1984, arrangements have been made for representatives of British police to be instructed by the Army in appropriate procedures.

610. No further mine clearance has been undertaken in the Falklands during the course of the year, but steady progress is being made in the search

an effective and safe method of detection of the FMkl plastic anti-personn mine, and experimental trials have begun.    It is still too early to asse the results.

Protection of Offshore Resources

611. Comprehensive surveillance of the United Kingdom&apos;s fisheries and

shore oil and gas fields is undertaken by the Royal Navy&apos;s Fishery Prot

Squadron and by RAF Nlmrods.   The aircraft keep in close touch with the

ected of

fishery protection vessels and direct them towards any vessels susp

-t 11 aees and

illegal fishing.   The air/sea patrols also seek and report oil spi

nd offshore

slicks, keep a close watch for infringements of safety zones arou installations, and police the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone around United Kingdom.

are parti&quot;

612. Deterrence of terrorist activity and response to incidents

Meteorology

614. The Meteorological Office, whose headquarters are at Bracknell, provide a detailed operational service for the armed forces and the Procurement Executive.   It is also the United Kingdom&apos;s national meteorological service and has a wide range of civil responsibilities.   On the domestic front, Meteorological Office supplies weather forecasts and warnings free to the public through the news media.   It also provides reports and forecasts 1  greater detail, for an appropriate fee, to specialist users including civi aviation (for which the Office provides one of the two World Area Foreca Centres), shipping, the offshore oil industry, manufacturing industries, agriculture, commerce, the public utilities, and local authorities.

Cont rol

615. We are well advanced in the implementation of the 1983 Resource

Savings

Review, which was designed to improve efficiency and value for mon

of about  200,000 per annum have been made in the use of domestic resour

A principal recommendation of the review was that commercial services

h has been

be developed in the longer term, and to this end a Marketing Branc

tor are

formed and consultants employed.   Joint ventures with the private s

.    office&apos;s gl bal being considered, particularly for overseas markets where tne

forecasting ability can be exploited.


LC579/2

^    On the research side, considerable effort is devoted to improving not nly forecasting techniques but also our understanding of natural and man-

^ e factors, such as increasing carbon dioxide, which may influence the

earth1o u

s climate.   The meteorological aspects of atmospheric pollution are

e*ng studied, and scientific evidence was provided for the recent House of

0mmons Environment Committee enquiry into acid rain.   Last year saw the end

tne research phase of the weather radar project and its adoption as an

 Perational tool.   Jointly funded by the Ministry of Defence and the Water

thorities&gt; weather radars are valuable aids to short-term forecasting, as Well

as providing much better data for water resource management, drainage and fionH

uoa warnings.   Five radars now cover parts of England and Wales, and

We h

Pe to extend the coverage to the whole of the United Kingdom and surrounding Waters ir,

n aue course, through further joint ventures and cooperation with

other p

European nations.

617. x

n the past year a number of hydrographic surveys have been completed,

h th

erseas and around the United Kingdom.   While much of the work has heen carr-i

led out by the Royal Navy&apos;s Surveying Flotilla, use has again been

a chartered vessel with a Royal Navy surveying party embarked, and dally contracted commercial surveying companies.

618. Th

e three craft of the Inshore Survey Squadron were paid off in March 1985 afte

er spending 26 years monitoring changes of depth in the unstable areas of ,

to be known as HMS Roebuck, which is scheduled to enter service in

619. During the winter months, when the weather was less suitable for

, Caribbean

work in United Kingdom waters, HM Ships Fawn and Fox, sailed to tne

to progress surveys begun there in the late 1970s.   HMS Herald spent the

southern winter months surveying in the Falkland Islands.

*    The M

young

we had in training 4,800 engineering apprentices (including 700

Pic ah 4

C its fn

ormation on 2 January 1985) and were the largest single employer j-n the engineering and shipbuilding industries.   We employ about

,00  craft

who flll

Professional and technology officer grades - junior and middle mana8ers who .

supervise the craftsmen and perform many other linked duties

  the demands of modern technology. 2*     Por many VB

years we recruited more apprentices than we strictly needed in er ^ contrih

bute to the country&apos;s need for skilled manpower, thus using

i. 6 Spare capacity for training which existed in many defence estab-

iish*ents. Re

s^ &apos;   everal establishments have closed or been severely reduced in

as further lowered the total numbers recruited each year.

Nevertheless we recruited 1,110 apprentices in 1984 (excluding those trans ferred to Royal Ordnance pic).

This group brings together people interested and willing to wo hard, some of whom may be specialists of repute in ornithology, entomology* archaeology and geology.   The Nature Conservancy Council is always repre sented.   Conservation groups start by carrying out a survey of the land, building up a dossier of maps, historical and geological records and no

comprehensive review of the military balance between NATO and the Warsaw

should ideally incorporate not only numerical comparisons of equipment and men u

ut also several important elements that can be highly subjective and do n t easn

1ly lend themselves to quantification.    A complete net assessment

would need

0 take into account not only differences in numbers of men, tanks, artm*

AAery&gt; aircraft, missiles, ships and so on, but also other qualitative fact

 rs that add to or subtract from their effectiveness. ^*    These f

actors include differences in geography, environment, military

strategy and

rorce structure, political organisation and cohesion. The

terrain

r which fighting might take place could favour either the attacker

 r the def

er and could also affect the ability to reinforce rapidly and

effectively

&apos;  or to conduct defence in depth.   Other important factors might delude the 1

length of time that forces would be able to fight (their SU8tainabiiitv^

y)&gt; which in turn is dependent on survivable logistic stocks

and SuPPiy u

nes for fuel, ammunition and spares.    Finally, there are intangible

a tors incl

t   Uc^ing training, leadership and morale, which as we saw in the

aIklands c

it is

extremely difficult to determine the relative weights of these 0rs, and

si attenti(on inevitably tends to be drawn to what appear to be the

when aircraft-delivered weapons are included (approximately 10,000 to 10,

against 9,000 to 10,000), the Soviet Union has more delivery systems. Tt

also has many more warheads on missiles and has about three times as m

Longer-Range Intermediate Nuclear Forces (LRINF)

26. These were the main systems under discussion in the intermediate nucle forces (INF) negotiations.    INF include all systems that fall between short range and strategic forces, and can be sub-divided between longer-range shorter-range systems.    The latter have a maximum range of about 1,000 km, the distance of Western Europe from the Soviet Union.

27. NATO&apos;s deployment of Pershing II missiles and ground-launched cruise

missiles (GLCM) is proceeding on schedule.   Three flights of GLCM are now

f its

deployed in the United Kingdom.    The Soviet Union has withdrawn some o

f new SS20

older, single-warhead SS4 missiles, but the rate of construction

( suf f I *~i enchases during 1984 was unprecedentedly high: at least ten new bases

for 90 missiles) are currently being prepared.    This construction progr

purposes, probably the new SS-X-25 ICBM; but meanwhile the number
