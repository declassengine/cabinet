roposals for handling the reports

kj^*. ministers directly concerned meeting under the Prime Minister&apos;s ^L^irmanship have considered these recommendations.    Their proposals to Hfe Cabinet are as follows:

^^K&apos;      The report of the AFP KB should be  implemented   in  lull   I rem

* April 1985.    Although the average increase is significantly higher than the &quot;going rate&quot; for pay increases in the public services (eg the settlement for civil servants), it is slightly below the current annual rate of increase in earnings.    The pattern of the increases (which vary from 4.0 to 8.5 per cent) reflects the intentions to offer*^^; t0 tbe skilled and trained people  the armed  forces need to recrMlj retain.    The staging of last year&apos;s recommendations caused a good deal of resentment in the armed forces, and servicemen in Germany have also suffered reductions in take-home pay as a result

0 decrea^wf^m local overseas allowances owing to lower local

inflation.^^S|ke the defence budget contains an allowance of only

Per cent  for pay increases,  full implementation of the report will result in som^Jra^tions elsewhere  in the defence budget.

D-      Within the^^i^Lof the cash provision, doctors and dentists f0      1 so far as ^^%ble, be treated  in the same way as the armed rces.    xhe provision for the cash-limited hospitals and community alth services (HCHS) programmes contains an allowance of 5i per cent to cover both inflation and 1 per cent improvement in services meet demographic needs (with medical advance and steps to remedy ious deficiencies f inance^lfcrom efficiency savings).    It is not Possible to finance the awJ^Ao^^6.4 per cent from 1 April within ,      Provision without cutting services, and it is proposed,

1 ^refore,  that the DDRB incr^O|^De paid in full  with effect from Fanf&quot;6 llle provision fonr^r&apos;^^tion in the non-cash-limited e^mi^y PractitLoner Service,  cov^^i^^eneral medical practitioners

   is 4^ per cent:  there are likely to be some savings to offset thelnSt excess cost of the award^^tfiem from 1 June  L985, and

year Verall position on the programmlM^^p be reviewed  Later this

       The nrb reports propose a subs tantil^^^tlary restructuring for torSej* and PAMs; this is the first time the Review Body has been able p   f   e considered judgments about salary structure across all these Was eSSions &quot; because the nrb was only established in mid-1983, there Und not time last year for the necessary detailed Wjck to be inc      aken&apos;    The aim of the Review Body has been iS*ve the largest UnqualSes to the main career grades, with smaller^j^^^teses for invol  lf^ed and younger nurses and for the highest ^^urses terms 6    particularly in administration.    Judged sol^u^l^management pro    &apos;  tnis Pattern of increases  is sensible.    The aveffgtaBincreases SUDgOSe    (8.6 per cent for nurses and 12.1 per cent  Cor PAMs) are provis&quot;tXally  &apos;&quot; excess of the National  Health Service ((W^J^sh Provi^ n&apos; antl sta8in8  i-S required to bring i hem within tn^^tfW shouial n L&apos;le current year.     It   is proposed that these l fcp%-.

receive 5 per cent (or the full amount of the award, wWerJL


this is less) on 1 April, with the remainder being paid on 1 February 1986.    The Chairman of the NRB has acknowledged that staging might be mM       necessary, but would have preferred a pattern which would have exceeded the existing provision very substantially.

inJ^ cases pensions would be based on the salaries actually in payment  &lt;j^%0rdance with the principle set out in the Prime Minister&apos;s Written  *wer on 13 April 1984 (OR, col 383).

COSTS

lim&apos; A^ tn*|^roposed increases would be met from within existing cash j_m     8 ^0%mV~86.    Ministers considering these proposal:; fell   i I the r t0 no^ to this principle in order to maintain consistency with

forc   Vernn,^W|^Btance on teachers&apos; pay.    In the case of the armed 0  t^  5  tne e^j^kover the 3 per cent provision  represents 0.7 per cent elsewh ^e^ence ^^^JL an&lt;^ could be absorbed through reduced spending def     ere within^Wgpfcufence cash limit, with consequential effects on Pract e .Capabilit^JiW*f-he case of the NHS,  the non-cash-limited Family jn thetl0ner Services programme is due to be reviewed later in the year; p,-0    &apos; event of of fsH^AiSk savings not then being  found some pari  ol the the     6    Lncrease woure to be met in duo course from the Reserve.    1 n
