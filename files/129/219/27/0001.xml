PENSIONS

Earnings-RSieed pension aims are t0 reduce the cost of the State Pensions- &amp; h&quot;&quot;^ Pension Scheme  (SERPS);  t^^e%expansion oi occupational The Green p&quot;    t0 increase choice through the C^^J^n of personal pensions, those withinPf^ proposed to achieve these by phasing out SERPS for all but 011 employers    1 years of pension age; and replace it by a requirement

joint cont &apos;V.t0.prov^de occupational or personal pensions, with a minimum ribution of 4 per cent of earnings.

 ur Greenepth&lt;!re 1S widesPread agreement that SERPS cAK^stay as it is, b dies whos^617 proposaiS have attracted substantial opposition from that the Gr  iSUpport we would value.     Ln summary,  their ^HB^ions are Cent contribun-PaPei WOLlld lead to higher costs for emplojKPfchat 4 per the so-called &quot; nS n0t enough to give an adequate pensi^^#ul that

consensus&quot; on pensions policy would be damage^^j^^

sh-ould&apos; recogn-the merits of these arguments are debatable,  I belBfl^e should recogniSe ^ Strength 0 L&apos; the opposition.    At   the same tiM^k^^ 18e that many of the bodies who oppose replacement or^SEJpkA


Vwere in favour of reducing the Scheme&apos;s emerging cost. 1 favour of modifying SERFS are the Confederation of British Industry the ^ft|tional Association of Pension Funds, major  insurance companies and main consumer bodies.

^ Jkhere is no doubt that modifying SERFS would provide an ^ter&quot;^^6 w*Tof meeting our objectives, with wider support.    I therero     V v that our pension strategy should be to:

a. make changes to SERFS so that we can afford it, while protecting . the pennons of people due to retire this century, women who intefC| their careers to bring up a family,  and the sick and disa^J^T^d people looking after them;

b. gilKfcyone the right to opt for a contracted-out personal pensionT^tlkd of remaining in his employer&apos;s scheme or fully SERPS; ^jj^

c      make conJEgjtog-out simpler for occupational pension schemes, so enc our aging ^^|^^pread;

d. give an addie^t financial incentive to newly contracted-out occupational schemes and personal pensions;

e. take further steps to give as many people as possible a pension from their job.

These proposals are set out in ^yfctail in Annex A. INCOME-RELATED BENEFITS

8-      The main elements in our agreed VSfLof income-related benefits are that we should: ^M^U.

a-      replace supplementary benefit w^^puch simpler scheme of income support/with all special paymeWJ^lt with by a separate discretionary social fund;

b-      replace family income supplement with family credit, on a basis consistent with income support and paid through the wage packet as offset to tax and national insurance contributions;^

c-      greatly simplify housing benefit,  again basMjw on the income ^PPort rules and treating people in and out of wMW^tne same basis; ^fcW^

d-      require that everyone should make some contribut^T^Ltheir

lL !?8re has been an encouraging response to the principle th4R k twif the income-related benefits on a more coherent footing aj^

modJf   ^ pr0pose no Ganges in the broad structure.    Annex B sets^^he ^ications which I propose in the light of consultations.


^VPHASING OF REFORMS

^PTJk   The other major issue is  timing.    Local authorities will have to th   ement the housing benefit changes; and employers will need to absorb ariu^inSl0n chan8es and the move to family credit.    Both groups have ^gued strongly that the Green Paper timetable of introduction in that       87 would be unworkable, and the local authorities have made clear on housing benefit they would not co-operate.

Play j^Ven^j^.cruc^al part that local authorities and employers have to tried    anWWBlnced that we would be courting operational disaster if we be f i!  lnsist on an April 1987 start.    The main legislation will need to Passed   ^ llPi^Mu^at*ons &gt;  and thus the time between regulations being propo r%5BKtation in April  1987  is very short.     1 therefore

avoidin t0 lntW?V the maJ r structural reforms  in April 1988, so Parliamentlle *   ^  * PPerati nal problems towards the end of this *n befor&quot; &apos;    ^ me Part of the programme of reform however can be brought Expendt*len&apos; and I have agreed with the Ministerial Group on Public reviewltUre 3 numbe^0|3^asures which bring early savings from the

more equal   *

will build in protection for people who have breaks in emp to bring up children, for the long-term sick and disabled/ for people looking after them.

(iii) calculate the SERPS oension as 20 per r^nt-. of earniSSL-^ - -----T77,pen

rather than 2 5 per cent.    But SERPS rights built up betwe

For the first time there will be a right for all employee5 ^ opt for a contracted-out oersonal tension.    Personal pensi n

an essential element in our policy of improving job moDi

t to stay

giving people more choice.    They must have the option no

Holders of personal pensions would have the advantage 01

The tax regime envisaged for personal pensions win &gt;-&gt;&apos;-

similar to that which applies now to retirement annuity c

contracts.    Thus contributions by employees will attr ^ at their marginal rate of income tax;  the build-up wit*11 fund will be exempt from tax;  and part of the ultimat


Thpre will be

nay b* commuted and taken as a tax free lump sam.    Tnei ^ provision for employers&apos; contributions within appropriate i wh-ich win be tax-deductible in the normal way.

J    additional Voluntary Contributions

P2 Ple in occupational schemes are able to pay extra contributions to boost their pension rights.    But at present they c^ only do so if their employers is prepared to make the ^cessary arrangements.    The Green Paper proposal that all schemes nust allow employees to pay additional voluntary C ntributions was universally welcomed,  and it is proposed that We should go ahead with it.

HANGES FR0M THE GREEN PAPER PROPOSALS ON INCOME RELATED BENEFITS

Pri_    ,      posals for income related benefits in the light of

c nsultation t-h 

ine main changes are set out below.

Psh-o       pioPosal that claimants under 25 should receive lower

QLes of

of nefit than older claimants has attracted a great deal

ticism at

for c &quot;&apos;    A1though I think we should hold to our position

 ^&quot;^Sle c 1 a.&quot;

c0UnlQ aimants,  I do not think we can sustain it for

to f^o* lcularly couples with children.    I propose therefore

other niai     &lt;   0uPles aged IS and over on the same basis. The

with      .4-     nanSe I propose is that we should give limited help mortgage int

m nths rs    -       1T:erest - rather than none - during the first six 0n income cs,

Duildinc? ouPport.    Negotiations are continuing with the

- Pieties about this.

A good deal

rund on a d&apos;            COncern has been expressed about operating a c nvincpr,       Cretlonary basis and with a fixed budget.    But I am

Present f&gt;i 1S is tne only way forward if we are to stop the

L Hood 0f ,

arre.nge single payments.    Detailed accounting

&apos;    Although the

6en Welcomed       mci;i-n structural changes in housing benefit have

l0rn the iQp ,      Sre nas been strong opposition, particularly

ever,,  ai authori

y ne shorn i xty associations,  to our proposal that

Uid Pav One

h iity *n

this proposal because of its implications for accountaoi

to m&amp;^c

local government, but I propose a number of other change the housing benefit proposals more acceptable:

Instead of one combined taper,  I propose that the ^

be separate tapers for rent and for rates.    This re

the heaviest losses that owner occupiers - especially

   oi nroposal

pensioners - would have faced under the original v

to operate

We had proposed that local authorities&apos; powers ^ ^

local schemes - within their own resources - shoul

abolished.    We have had a large number of represe

4-e for war

about the effect of this on special arrangements

pensioners,  and I propose that we should allow l c

authorities to keep local schemes for that puipu
