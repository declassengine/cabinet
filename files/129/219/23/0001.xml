THE EXPENDITURE POSITION

3       . v. a^t some programmes.    Details are shown

J- Agreements have been reached^|r some v &amp; reduced their proposals W Annex B.    In some other cases colleagues 1 may

implied overshoots are after taking credit^* *P       * noted at the assets and the transfer to programmes from Fhe^|e 11 July discussion.

I&apos;     It is therefore essential for colleagues greatly to JJ*^&apos;^*, l demands in order to meet our expenditure  bJectlVe&quot;&apos;^baseline.    It is    t continue to press for substantial reductions ^^&quot;J^ essential that as a Government we not only set ^&quot;Q^^i^ on expenditure within what can be afforded but also take in ^dividual programmes necessary to adhere to those limMTO

10, We have made satisfactory progress on this j&quot;1^^&apos;&quot;^&quot;10&quot;8 ar  still proceeding in some cases, but I presently e*p&quot;&apos; *g8Q8|_87 and ^rgets for disposal well in excess of  100 million for both 1986 1987-88 to be agreed; with a further  100 million in 1988-89.

NEXT STEPS

11. 1 believe it will be possible to make some ^^b&quot;?&quot;8^^&quot; costs continuing bilateral exchanges, particularly in &quot;lation to run  * U^ts.    But given the substantial gap between col^agues  PjW|L  * the total expenditure limits to which the Government has V% committed itself, the Cabinet will now wish to take stock of the rSoj^


and to consider whether, as in recent years, a small group of Ministers should be convened under the chairmanship of the Lord President of the

^Council to examine outstanding differences and to make recommendations on

&gt;m0v they might be resolved.
