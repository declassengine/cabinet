LEGISLATION ON COMMERCIAL SURROGACY

Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

At its meeting last week, the Home and Social Affairs Committee (H) discussed proposals from the Secretary of State for Social Services on the way forward foll/&amp; to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation anlcGnflkyology (the Warnock Report).    The Secretary of State proposed that whilf^Vf slat ion to implement the Warnock Report as a whole should be brought ty&amp;gfa for the 1985-86 Session, on one aspect -commercial surrogacy X^/aent legislation to outlaw this practice should be brought forward thi/^ \ion.    The Committee concluded that it would be unwise to legislate on^^spect alone in this Session but that I should report the issues to Cabinejfe^or a final decision.

background

2.     Surrogacy is the practic&amp;ChVirfcby one woman carries a child for another with the intention thar&lt; hWpfci Id should be handed over after birth.    Commercial surrogacy is wh r ^yment is made by the woman or couple who receive the child after h^&amp;to the surrogate mother and to the agency which has brought the paVt i^together.    The recent case of baby Cotton, which involved such arra^flC^ts, has received considerable Publicity; the local authority social s&amp;Vip^s department and the High Court intervened; and there is s ignif ica^/publ ic feeling that such arrangements should be prohibited by legislation.    There are believed to be a number of other cases where surrogate mothers will give birth over the coming months.    The pressure to legislate is therefore unlikely to go away and more likely to increase. // ~\\

3-      On surrogacy,  the Warnock Committee recommev de/4^\

a. That legislation be introduced to render^&amp;rf^al the creation or the operation in the United Kingdom of aSenc&quot;7^^e PurPoses include the recruitment of women for surrogate PriwW,or making arrangements for individuals or couples who wish tVa^Use the services of a carrying mother; such legislation shouUgfc\wide enough to include both profit and non-profit making organisa^nd)

b. That the legislation be sufficiently wide to render&lt;Vv^nally liable the actions of professionals and others who knowinW^^sist in the establishment of a surrogate pregnancy. l/y\


^ c.     That it be provided by statute that all surrogacy agreements are

p illegal contracts and therefore unenforceable in the courts.

^)*E SECRETARY OF STATE&apos;S PROPOSALS

\YvXs noted above, on the generality of Warnock&apos;s recommendations the vte^fto&apos;tary of State for Social Services is carrying out consultations with t^&apos;AjJ&amp;antion of bringing to colleagues proposals for general legislation nextr Sp^Xion.    He is, however, convinced that,  in view of the considerable Pres^are&gt;^D take urgent action,  legislation should be introduced this Sessio^if/t]9^deal solely with commercial surrogacy arrangements (ie the recomme^w5j  ton at 3a. above).    While recognising that there will be complicatgA# ?in preparing legislation urgently on this aspect alone and that it wMSl not be easy to confine debate, he considers it will be very difficult tw hold a situation in which there are no moves to legislate until next Session.

H COMMITTEE&apos;S VI^i^F^

Some members o/f/ITuSommittee felt that the case for outlawing surrogacy had not wbsrAade out.    They noted that two members of the Warnock Committee hadx^wsrjjcnted from the relevant recommendations, and that the much reduced opTvjjPfcvunities for adoption increased the case for alternative arrangements^svNcluding possibly a role for agencies to whom Payments were made.    They tjVgfi&amp;ht that it would be unwise to legislate before public debate had t^rji^nypnsideration  f these aspects further.

There was also a feeling^taO^e Committee that more thought was needed about whether the legis^rAirfb would apply to non-profit-making agencies (which might none the les^thft^ge a fee to cover their costs) as WeH as to profit-making agencies^aarow the line that was drawn could be Justified. were convinced that t^^m^adical professions would strongly

resist a Bill which put them at risle oi^prosecution for carrying out, for example, artificial insemination in rt^trfS^for fees.

Furthermore all members of the ComvrC^tee were impressed by the clear Vlew  f the Lord Chancellor and the Solictor General that it would be unwise to embark on legislation without thinking through with care the

amily and legal status of children resulting from surrogate pregnancies, and the implications of fertilisations which toqkCBi.ace overseas or in

CONCLUSION [CjJ

Overall the view in H Committee was that the prels^fc^-for legisation  n commercial surrogacy this Session should be resisted^bf^s allowing ime for opinion to form further and for the legal issuesv^jeed by the 0rd Chancellor and the Solicitor General to be properly m&amp;fght through and a line determined.    The Government should, however, prrofs^a)iead with lts consideration of this and the other issues raised by WaVf^r^vBO that We are in a position to legislate on all of them next Sessiorx^\V^^


^9.      in view of the current controversy,  I invite colleagues to consider &gt;0(hether legislation to deal only with commercial surrogacy should be vj?ktr duced this Session as a matter of urgency.
