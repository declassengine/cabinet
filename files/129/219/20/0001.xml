z-     This memorandum sets out the preaei     v under which the Irish

approval for the text for an agree etl^intergovernmental Commission, Government would be able in a new biLateral *ntergovernmental within the framework of the existing Anglo l British Government on

Council,  to put forward views and proposals to ^ executive

defined aspects of Northern Ireland affailM^fc 0r decision-raaking authority. ^^^^

BACKGROUND

3-     The proposals considered initially with the Iris^^^f^^ ^turn for an amendment to Articles 2 and J or ^ North as part

(which have long offended unionists by laving.^n&apos;90,Be kind of role of the territor? of the Republic), Dublin would be given ln reapect of security and judicial matters in the H rt  

4&apos;      The role at  first sought by Dublin was  for soot^  ^j|^L^ear   8 r/sPonsibility (ie a form of joint .authorityr as propose   i    1   ^ ary y Ireland Forum report and clearly &quot;Jecte* We made clear that

^ate f0r Northern Ireland and the Prime M er). hQweve ,

n  executive role for them was on offer.    We in tf0Ull5el would be prepared to establish a formal basis on which      y ^


--Belted about certain aspects of Northern Ireland affairs, although

ause of Irish sensitivities, which on this point we have sought to take |   mto account,  the proposed text does not use the term &quot;consultation&quot;.

LW*     The Irish told us that on this basis they would not be able to secure ny change to Articles 2 and 3 of their Constitution.    This would require p m erendum,  the outcome of which would be very uncertain.    But the Irish ,&apos;r&quot;   ,rnraent said that they would be ready to enshrine in an agreement, ^pWtered with the United Nations,   their recognition that Northern

and was part of the United Kingdom and would remain so for as long as ne majority there wished.

THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT

^ne If^j^pt Annex contains the following main features -

a Ha

A firm rejection by both Governments of violence and those who support^J^i^rth sub-paragraph of the preamble).

A forMi^^kd binding statement  that change in the status of Northern Ire&apos;^K :ould come about only with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland;  that the present wish of the majority is for no change;  and that,  if in the future a majority in Northern Ireland

ormally consentwl ^Athe unification of Ireland,  the two Governments would support legi^RtTon accordingly (paragraph 2).

c      Provision for the establishment of a new bilateral Intergovernmental Commission, where the Irish could put forward views and Proposals on defined matters relating to Northern Ireland. Determined efforts would b|E^ to resolve differences but there would be no derogation of sovereignty and decisions would remain in

ritish hands.    Ministers and officials would participate in its meetings  (paragraph 5).    It wovkra^cnsider certain political matters ( Paragraphs 9,   11 and 12);    seci^ta matters, notably relations

etween the nationalist minority^kJdyie security forces ^Paragraphs 13-16); legal matters (paragraph 17); and cross-border co-operation (paragraphs 18-21), notably in the field of security.

e working of the Commission would lJi^^^iewed after three years, or sooner if necessary (paragraph 23).     ? JjL

7   Th

been     e text .contains one passage on which agreement in principle has not Brit-r^acned in the negotiations.    The Irish have pressed very hard for a North     Commitment to establish within a stated time mixed courts of Parts   0 3nC* ^outnern Irish judges for trying terrorist offences in both Commit-0^ *relar&gt;d.    We are clear that we can enter inta^^such advance be Co   ^nt on tnis complex subject, but have agreed that the question can 8cluare u *-n tne new Intergovernmental Commission.    The sentence in

rackets in paragraph 17 of the text reflects our^^fej^on.

w uld^b^anCement under the agreement of cross-border ~rnirr^^jg^peration good- k    3 rea^ Prize for us.    In many matters co-operation i&lt;a already achieved &apos;W&amp; ^ave reached something of a plateau, and much more could be ln such areas as exchange of intelligence; frustrating^^T^


^rovisional Irish Republican Array money-making activities; and controlling to   Producti n of home-made explosives.    An agreement should open the way \      SUDstantially improved co-operation in such matters.

&amp;implementation of the agreement

s&apos; k ^&quot;^e Ir:*-Sn have pressed us in the talks for &quot;associated measures&quot;,   , changes  in the security forces  in Northern Ireland,   to be taken

c,   *^^|?e agreement was signed.    We have resisted on the grounds that such ^   ges would antagonise the unionists and thus endanger the effectiveness the*&quot;*16 agreement as a whole.    We have argued that rapid implementation of Thi a^reement would be an acceptable alternative to &quot;associated measures&quot;, soon W U^ involve a first meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission mee^.after signature of the agreement.    a communique&apos; issued at the Summit  ^rsln8 at- Which the agreement is signed would indicate the agenda of the

meet^jl&apos;a* the Commission after which certain measures would be would&quot;0    &apos;    ^6 *r^Sn measures *-n rapid implementation of an agreement ac^e   be rede^^pj^t of Garda task forces  to the border area and ^   ssion to th^Ei^opean Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The w uld W U^d ^e  ^ real help to us in the security field, and the second n be a major ^^fcAhrough in facilitating extradition from the

Qn       lc  f persons suspected of involvement in terrorism.    The measures new p6 Br&apos;&apos;&apos;t&apos;-Sn side ^^Q|^^nclude announcement of the introduction of a res           ^ Conduct tak ^jkRoyal Ulster Constabulary,  stressing equal c       ct for the two tra^^^^hs in Northern Ireland; various limited steps Co__   rning the Ulster Defence Regiment; and proposals for increased legal operation between the two parts of Ireland.

likely reactions to an agreement 10.  Th t\%

Un1 Irish have made it clear that they cannot conclude the agreement

beli.SS they 3re satisfied that the SDLiP wil1 support it.    The Irish d0tn     e that they will secure that support, and be able to counter iniDl    10 P^iti-oal criticism of the ^pe ent, only if we agree to rapid st       entation of the agreement as oir^fcn^k above,  involving substantial w uld  n  Ur side-    0n this basis, we t4^W a good chance that the sdlp side    SuPPort the agreement as a modest ^Kd^rward.    On the unionist likpl reacti ns to an agreement on the lines being discussed would be

abii&gt; t0 be very negative.    There would be^iccmations that  the Irish beginn^ t0 advance vi-ews i  the new Intergovernmental Commission was the Possibi^        creeping unification.    There might be some disorder and N rt.he ^ lndustrial action.    But, subject to developments on the ground in we th&apos;1^ *reland and in the light of contacts so far with unionist leaders uni0n-      fcbat unionist reactions would be containable.    The more moderate c0_0 Ists would see  that  the prospect offered by the ag^fcraent of greater gain     ation with the Republic in countering terrorism was a substantial

Solution if

should aSreement is signed and works reasonably well,  the minority

repre    See tbat their views and interests are being more effec jKj^

sented to the Government and are being taken properly into account.


Th f-

ln time should build up their confidence in the institutions in ^dev       . Ireland and increase the prospect that they will co-operate in evolution.    The unionists, for their part, are likely to see an agreement 3 reason for standing even further off from any internal settlement ^^jj^ch would be acceptable to the minority.    But they would have the ^irh^mt&quot;1Ye tnat a devolved government would take a number of matters out of ^^Pfcpbit of the  Intergovernmental Commission.    They  Loo,   therefore, might ^ 6^ their position over time.

INTERNATI0NAL REACTIONS: A POSSIBLE FUND

tg&apos;jj ^nere ^e good reasons to expect an agreement on the lines proposed and     WarSL| melcorned by friendly countries and notably the Administration weliC nSr^J|SLthe United states-    Tne United si ales Administration could

be willing to invite Congress to provide a very large sum - perhaps mo^a,hundmZ^^^ millions o  dollars - for expenditure  in Ireland, and Blight   ln t&apos;le &apos;^^w as a 8esture  f support for an agreement. There non_   also be a^^Si^ct of attracting to an appropriate private fund whi h Vernmental ^i^ Lbutions in the United States,  including some money EurC    at Present gJK^k the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID). gov Pean Community Governments might also wish to contribute to a to l  nmental fund; bd^th^L would need careful handling.    There  Ls no need clear     tnis gift horse^^^^he mouth.    But we should want it to be very since t^at t&apos;le money was a reaction to the agreement, not a part of it, the r otnerwise we would be accused by unionists of making concessions to attr   ^U in return for American money.    It is clear that,  in order to

gover  c ntribution from the United States Administration, the

Its   n,nent;al fund would have to J^^dditional to existing expenditure. Cno^purposes and management would require careful consideration, and the Ce of projects very careful judgment.

lMlNG AND MANNER FOR CONCLUDING ANT^^pNT

a8reeme t*me bas  een agreed for an Anglo-Irish Summit to conclude an The loc&quot;11&quot;&apos;    BUt k tn sides have late September in mind as a possibility. The Tao^tl0n s^8nin8 the agreement is ^flBfcptill under discussion,

the p .1Seacn does not want the meeting to^^h^d in Great Britain, and in (-ne    6 Minister would be criticised by the^^^^iists  if it  Look place there       pubi:j-c.    A Summit in Northern Irelancris one possibility, but be a ty U^ be formidable problems of security.    Another possibility would and then~^art meet*-n8&gt; with signature taking place first in one country logist-    ln tne other; but this would present complicated difficulties of lcs and press handling.

^&quot;W-Utlo. 0P PARLIAMENT

signatu6 &apos;&apos; &apos; ProPose to pul the agreement to the Dail ^^^^^ two after commiSs-e before the  first meeting of the IntergovernmeSalf.

outstanding point is whether the agreement   which in Ij^^*^ Anglo-Irish agreements does not   ave     atified, ments had

force on signature or on a stated date after the ^ vernmental Rebated it but before the first meeting of the Interg the Commission.    If Parliament was recalled to debate  e ag suade the

F reign and Commonwealth Office and Northern ^^Kid Office 23 July 1985


Draft of 24 July 1985

ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS:     NORTHERN IRELAND

British Proposal

1. The Go^^^nent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland -

wishing further^^^elop the unique relationship betwe%^^keir peoples and the close co-operation between their countries as friendly neighbours an%a^^rtners in the European Community;

recognising the major interest 9jtf^&gt;th their countries,  and above all of the pBtf^   f Northern Ireland,  in diminishing trr H isions

w

there and achieving lasting peace and Jtl stability;


recognising the need for continuing efforts to reconcile the two major traditions that exist in Ireland, represented on the one hand by those who wish for no change in the present status of Northern Ireland and on the other hand by those who aspire to a sovereign united

| Ireland achieved by peaceful means

Dpd through agreement:

r^a% rming their total rejection of any attempt to promote political objectives by violen^erOT: the threat of violence and their determination to work together to combat those who adopt or symport such methods;

recognising that a condition of genuine reconciliation ancr^k^^&gt;gue between unionists and nationalists is mutual recognition and acceptance of each otheV^^Lghts;

recognising and respecting the identities of the two communities in Northern^^^Land, and the right of each .to pursue its aspirations by peaceful and constitutional meansif^^m

reaffirming their commitment to a societs^J^^


Northern Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination and intolerance and with the opportunity for both communities to participate fully in the structures and processes of government;

| le as follows:

\

II    ^tjbus of Northern Ireland

1. agree that any change in the status of Northern IrelanJL could come about only with the consent ol^^^fcajority of the people of Northern Ireland%^i^

2. recognise that the present wish of a majority of the people wf^^^rthern Ireland is

&quot;   for no change in the status of Northern Ireland;

3. declare that,  if in the future a,majority of the people of Northern Ireland cli^r y wished for and formally consented to the establishment of a united Ireland, they would


support the introduction in the respective Parliaments of legislation to give effect to that wish.

Ill. The Intergovernmental Commission

ipmV  There would be established within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Couimil#a new body, to be known as the Interg^jp^mental Commission,  to deal on a regular

^T&quot; &quot;    &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;,,h&quot;

a. political matters;

b. security^^M^elated matters;

XL

c. legal matters,  including the administration of justice;

d. cross-border co-operation; as set out in this agreement.


4.      Unlike the existing AIIC machinery this Commission would be primarily concerned with North/South rather than East/West relationships and would meet on a regular rather than ad hoc basis. The British Government would accept that the Irish Government would put forward views and proposals on  tfkers relating to Northern Ireland within the bq^W^remit    in so far as those matters were not the ^sensibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.    Attention would thus be given to these mad^^^^t the highest level.    In the interest of^^crhoting peace and stability, determined efforts would be made through the Commission to resolve any differences.    The focus of the Commission&apos;s work would be mainly in Northern Ireland;  bufl^Bp^ of the matters under consideration would in^^S^o-operative action in both parts of the island JJkeland and possibly also in Great Britain.    Some%o^^ie proposals considered in respect of Northern Ireland might also be found to have application by the Irish Government.    There would be no derogat^%i of sovereignty on the part of either the United Kingdom Government or the Irish GovernmeTJ|^^o that


each would retain responsibility for the administration of government within its own jurisdiction.

5.      The Commission would meet at Ministerial or official level, as required.    There would be  ^ lar and frequent Ministerial meetings; and spjra meetings could be convened when necessary at t^^^juest of either side.    Officials might meet in Sub-Committees.    Membership would be small and flexl^^^When the Commission met at Ministerial^rev^l the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and an Irish Minister designated as the Permanent Iri^h Ministerial Representative would be joint Cha%JkS|L    Other British and Irish Ministers could atteil|^pfctings as appropriate: thus when legal mattersVfcSfk under consideration the Attorneys General migh^RAtend. Ministers would be accompanied by the^^^^.cials and professional advisers:  for example, when questions of security policy or security co-operation were being addressed they could be accompanied by the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Commissioner of the Garda Siochafj^^^A permanent Secretariat would be establishecf^^Jhe two Governments.


6. In relation to matters coming within its remit, the Commission would constitute a framework within which the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic of Ireland could work together:

4ml i.      for the accommodation of the rights and ^K^fjentities of the two traditions which exist EnWorthern Ireland; and

\  _  .  ,

throug^Kr Ireland by promoting reconciliation, respect for human rights, co-operation aq^.nst terrorism and the development o^Jko^iomic,  social and cultural co-operation.

%

7. It is the declared policy of the British Government that responsibill^y^^^respect of certain matters within the remit of the Secretary  f State for Northern Ireland should be devolved within Northern Ireland on a basis wbjtfk would secure widespread acceptance throughorR^Jke community.    The Irish Government supporFj^T^. policy.


8. Both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of the constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both the traditions there.    If full devolution had not taken place, the Commission would constitute a framework within which the Irish fiArnment could put forward views and proposals on tr3JH^dalities of devolution in Northern Ireland, in sf fIk: as they bore on the interests of the

m i n o r if^Ammu n i t y.

Political M^Ptgrs

9. The Commission would concern itself with measures to recognise and accommodate the rights and identities of ^jSTj^o traditions in Northern Ireland,  to protect W^M^rights and to prevent discrimination.    Matter%k3^kbe considered in this area in respect of Northern Ireland include measures to foster the cultu^a^^^ritage of both traditions, changes in electoral arrangements, the use of flags and emblems, the avoidance of economic and social discrimination and the adv^tf^ges and disadvantages of some form of Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland.


10. The focus of discussion of these matters would be on Northern Ireland, but the possible application of any such measures by the Irish authorities in the South would not be excluded.

f

11. Should it prove impossible to achieve and sustain devolution on a basis which would secure wJ^BJ^cead acceptance in Northern Ireland, the Comm^sfcn would constitute a framework within which the Irish Government could put forward views on propolDp^Cor major legislation,  and on major policy issu^swithin the purview of the Northern Ireland Departments which remained the responsibility of th|k Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, ^Mjd^icantly and especially affecting the interes^5i|i the minority community.

12. The Commission would \prOVide a framework within which the Irish Gove^mp^ could put forward views on appointments to be made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to bodies including -

the Standing Advisory Commission on^UiMn Rights;


the Fair Employment Agency; the Equal Opportunities Commission; the Police Authority for Northern Ireland; |ml the Police Complaints Board.

%

SecugLt#,and Related Matters

a.      security policy;

en the security forces and the community; ^?W^

c.      prisons policy. W^f^

14.    The Commission would address the security situation at its regular meetings.    This would provide an opportunity to address P ltfk issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events (eg parades and processions).


15.    The Commission would consider relations between the security forces and the community, with particular reference to the minority community in Northern Ireland.    With a view to promoting greater confidence in the security system, a programme of action would be put in hand which might include: i^kestablishment of local consultative machinery, tr^0M^g in community relations,  crime prevention schemes involving the community,  improvements in arrangements for handling complaints, and action to increase^HObproportion of members of the minority in the RUC.^^^ would be accepted by both sides that these matters would be directed primarily towards Northern Ireland, with the object of making the security force^A^e readily accepted by the minority community t^Jfc^^but that some of them might be developed by ^fcjkish authorities in ways which might have an applivGfkn in the South. The Commission could also r^Te^the structure, composition and powers of the^olice Authority for Northern Ireland.


16. The Commission would be able to consider policy issues in the prisons.    Individual cases could be raised as appropriate, so that explanations could be given or inquiries instituted.

fcm&amp;l Matters,  Including the Administration of --

17. Tn^pQjnmission would deal with issues of concern sPlrath countries relating to the

enforcement^^f the criminal law.    In particular it would consider whether there are areas of the criminal law applyiaa in the North and in the South respectively which might with benefit be harmonised.    The two^oifccnments agree on the desirability of ensuring that there is public confidence in the administration of justice. [The Commission will seek makrp^o this end, considering inter alia the possibility of establishing a system of joint courts for trying terrorist crimes.]    It would also be^^^cerned with the oversight and review of arrangemeH^^^tween North and South for extradition and extra-territorial jurisdiction.


Cross-border Co-operation Security Co-operation

18. With a view to enhancing co-operation between the security forces of the two Governments, the Commission would set in hand a programme of work to ^^^ndertaken by the Chief Constable and the Commissioner and groups of officials in such areas as tVel: assessments, exchange of information, liaisol^%pKictures,  technical co-operation,

 . .,^r,. -  

19. The Committee would have no operational responsibilities; responsibility for police operations would remain with the heads of the respective police for^Mp^and the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Con%k^^.ary would maintain his existing links with the Secretary of State and the Commissioner of the Garda S^c^p^ his accountability to the Minister for Justice.

Economic. Social and Cultural Co-operation

20. The two Governments would co-operat^#ccm promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which hive

4


suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years, and consider the possibility of securing international support for this work.

21. Should it prove impossible to achieve and vE&amp;ain devolution on a basis which would secure

widespread acceptance in Northern Ireland, the CoinnMsaBon would constitute a framework for the promotion of co-operation between North and South in Irela^gfcaWL relation to cross-border aspects of economic, ^rcial and cultural matters in relation to which the Secretary of State continued to exercise authority

22. if responsibility were devolved in respect of certain matters under wk^kheading currently within the remit of the Secretary of State,  there would need to be machinery for pr%:t^kal co-operation between the responsible authorities North and South in respect of cross-border aspects of those issues.


Arrangements for review

23. At the end of three years from signature of this agreement, or earlier if requested by either party, the working of the Commission would be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any fC^ges in the scope and nature of its activities w^^^sirable.

Ol

IV.    Inter-Parliamentary Relations

\

24. The tw^^OTernments agree that it would be for the Houses of Parliament in Westminster and the Oireachtas in Dublin to consider whether an Anglo-Irish Parliamentary body of the kind adumbrated in the AngCQjrish Studies Report of November 1981 should beVftS^blished.
