GAS SUPPLY AND REGULATION

|Py  , The main business of gas supply to the majority of small consumers is inherent monopoly and will  require regulation on price and on terms and ^^iPVitions of supply (including an appropriate continuation of an ^J^tion to supply).    The principal  regulatory  feature.&apos;;,   for which we /^ ^^provide in the legislation, are described in Annex 1.    In summary tfiese are:

a&apos;      Establishment of a regulatory body with a small permanent staff working within guidelines laid down, which would be capable of amendn |t by defined procedures.    The regulatory body would have its  wn distinct functions but could,  in practice, work closely alongside or be combined with the Office of Telecommunications.

k-      A s%jflhof price regulation similar to that applied to BT. In the gas ca^^Me formula (RPI-X+Y) would provide that prices could riSe no fasrjjgjfi^n inflation less a performance  target  (X) for reducing onsrojpfcflsts within the company&apos;s direct control plus an  &quot;&apos;ditional tenR^fl^covering costs of offshore gas purchase. The

ormula would bSStevaged across the prices charged by the company and would be baclredj^by a duty not:  to discriminate between customers. W

c&apos;      Various detailed requirements governing connection of customers .nto fche system, maintenance of supply and withdrawal of supply (an issue with potentially important regional implications where the lntention would be,  broadly,  to maintain the status quo).

in gas e COmPany would be a Compat^HWp;t company with rights and duties The i    Supply defined in the statut^^^Jtorobably conferred by a licence, of ij1CetllTe would need to run for a s^psMntial term but the possibility obliga(;&quot;Slng  thers   in appropriate ci^^ Mices - with corresponding pr0vis-1OnS&apos;   &apos; &apos;   example,  on safety - wW^Aot be excluded. The by tnel ns of the Oil and Gas  (Enterpr ise^Qjd^f or common carriage of gas c ntinuedmPany a&apos;ld f l&quot; direc(; sale of gas ^P^S^etitors would be &quot;gas utii&apos; p ss&apos;-bly with some adjustments anfc^Jkovements.    The stricl lv ring f     lty&quot; part of the company&apos;s business ^^Tlff be operated within a will bp f6&apos; SeParately accounted to the regulator and policed by him. It *n&gt; in th r ^&quot;&quot;deration whether the Government should be able to step supply an^ ^ast resort, eg if the company collapsed, to maintain gas n   bli     .Secure the safety of the system.    The Government would assume sPeci3n n3 l0&quot; to the shareholders in this event.    Thisu^^L require 3lly ^signed accounts. %EL\

a*     Showrooms.    The new company would be unlikey to want to maintain * the retail outlets in their present form, once restriction to gas

&quot;m        retailing with its relatively poor economics ceased.    The way forward

would most likely lie  in more  flexible joint venture arrangements ^&quot;nk    with other more experienced retailers and,   in some cases,   probably a ^^^kmore diverse range of retailing by the company itself.

       Installation and Servicing. The company could also be expected to take a more searching look at its servicing operation and the underlying economics.    Some gradual shakeout would be on the cards and probably some growth in activity by independents.    It would be necessary to provide that BGC1s non-chargeable emergency service to ^e^^tf^ gas leaks on the consumer&apos;s side &gt;&gt;l   the meter continues: this would be funded by a charge on the regulated gas supply

5 A price control system would operate on prices elelDent (including the company&apos;s onshore gas supply costs and^Qyfever  t0

of gas purchase cost).    The system would not extend, h retailin*

the operation of the ancillary businesses upstream provideS where general legislation (eg. on fair trading) air the framework for all participants.


Annex i

to system of control operated by the regulator would extend

gas sales by the company including contract sales to industry. 7 The

acc control system for the industry&apos;s prices will have to take

By sh0r&gt;e     &apos; ttle reniaining costs, ie. those for delivery of gas on-per.  &apos; are directly within the company&apos;s control and recent BGC ex-reUUct&gt;     uSgests that there remains considerable scope for real aii0Ws     3 trough greater efficiency.    This points to a system which acQui -8aS prices to consumers to take account of the company&apos;s cost c COs^s, but puts firm downward pressure on the onshore

Public exposure of the gas purchase price element.

The detain

of sp^, i       ails of the system and other controls such as on quality of th* need to  e further elaborated.    Details of the role

eXaiBinaf or in implementing the system (eg. frequency of

of char&gt;         f industry, arrangements for determining the correctness ur gas costs) will need to be settled.

Extra
