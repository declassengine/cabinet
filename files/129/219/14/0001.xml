LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1985-86 ^Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

(CCfRq^6 Cabinet discussed the legislative programme on 28 February

nex A to C(B5)&lt;&amp;J/sW\ere was also a good case for legislation to remove burdens on ^y* ^ksses and to deregulate the private rented sector if policy is\8^ Vu)uld be resolved.    It was possible that a

l.H on Royal Dockyard^&amp;ght be justified if the policy could be settled in good time. ?&quot;^nVlposition would therefore require to be reviewed as policy on t^E^^ssues became more certain&quot;.

In 4^&lt;u^W, the Cabinet have decided to add Northern     t0        Pr gramme and to dj^era^ the Nationalised Industries and changes&quot; lreland (Emergency Provision^^Mlls.

CONCLUSIONS

 &quot;AN*      *n coming to a conclusion, QL was conscious of the far-reaching ^jL\ re or tne deregulation of rents and the absolute need for changes to /^made next Session,  if at all in this Parliament.    We felt that \k^j^S1 n  ^ triis legislation should be our highest priority.    We were ^^/ted in our consideration by the very helpful proposals made by the Pr c^^f  ^ State ror the Environment.    Recognising our difficulties, he aP o t^^t^at t*16 Hou8in8 Bill should not contain provisions on the to j^5//&apos;&gt;ent  ^ rent charges, as originally proposed, and that the right ^0Ca^^^^P^sions should be reduced in size.    He also suggested that his pol&apos;  .^e^/ J nt legislation should be limited to the need to deal with 0n ^1CaVp^yertising by local authorities (Widdicombe) and discrimination str   6 ^6 \^n  or contracts, with a possibility of need for some Plan&quot;^11611        ^ the &apos;Law on rate limitation.    He suggested that his substln^ ^Sislation (simplified planning zones and control of hazardous Se     ances) might bp added to the Housing Bill, or even proceeded with as Parate legisla/ jlA

Princ^ter Carer^T~^6rT^deration and discussion with the Ministers legislPa^ly concern^-^hv Committee agreed that room should be found for howeve3*&quot;1011  n dere^u^f/p^ or the private rented sector.    They concluded, i  Home&apos;  t*lat this musr^p^/fche limit for legislation on housing. Changes the r-6, Improvement Grair^A^portionment of rent charges and changes in the li8-    t0 ^uy should wai^2-\They did however agree that legislation on for tn 1 ec* local governmewr^ jects proposed by the Secretary of State the a     Envir nment, and on\p4^ \ng, should proceed.    They also accepted more ^Ument Put forward by th^^asury that this Bill should include no local   an        clauses to remedVyra e);ts in the existing controls over government capital expendj&amp; fc&gt;

adding&quot;1^*16 ^&quot;*&amp;ht of these dec is ion^^/lfhfe Committee saw no possibility of either a Dockyards Bill or a D&amp;r^gulation Bill to the programme.

12. The

^e to in  VeraH effect on the programm  jdj/phe proposed additions would StraightfreaSe *ts size.    This Session&apos; s^Mogramme is proving by no means Session&apos;  rwarc* and the Committee was concerned to ensure that next 8r w no S programme, which is already larger than that for 1984-85, should WeH as ?^re&quot;    In order to accommodate the addition of a Rents Bill, as w uld be   ^ GaS previously agreed, we there&gt; 5*k concluded that it

CoinPensat^1Se t0 ^e-*-ete two more medium sized Bi(fls&lt;jfrom the programme in essentia] t1011&apos;    Ttle choice was difficult but, in ^Bte^Oeihmittee&apos; s view, lay balance     v hetween Education, Wages aqd Consumer Ogo^y^and Services. On c uld be df With SOme re8ret, we concluded that thV^p*st two of these eterred more easily than the latter.

13. The C^y^

b-     The Local Government and Planning Bill currently in the Programme should be restricted to dealing with:
