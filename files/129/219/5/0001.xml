LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1985-86 AND 1986-87

Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

The seeches and Future Ugisl.tion C-ittee have

bids for 1986-87 is av^MP^ B* SIZE OF 1985-86 PROGRAMM^^^^X

2. 1985-86 is the  id-Sefs|^* the P li r&quot; fnfluencedV&quot;^&quot;  hich our choice of le8isUt^U,e y   o   e    nnuenced

effects on the programme of a^g^r^r ith considerable weight and accordingly sought to construct &amp;-^jl*ramme     Session of

Political content which will ^^^^llTste risk   &quot;terns of normal length.    In doing so   we ^^^o take some ^ ^.^ ^

^SSS - JTtiiS^S^I.&quot; legislation.

3. The first risk we have taken lies ^i&quot;!^c^^^and ^ve recommended a total of 33 BlllSth^cWf/t ^ last Session, contingent Bills).    This is larger than ^ARf*&quot;&quot;* J .    events. Amongst ^though that figure itself has already been^oyertak^Jy events.

those we have recommended are some very conten^OU%^SUAnSimals cross-Party terms&gt; in particular Agriculture, Educatig , Animal8 (Scientific Procedures), Shops and Civil Avxation^I^additxon   th^ ^ a number of large Bills which will be contentious ^S^=N he mosC

?ay well not be&apos;able to be introduced as soon as &quot; gj^J pining important of these is Social Security, but Local Gove^^*

even without any legislation on Dogs) and Wages are  *WgSg   ive the Unless we secure the early introduction of these Bills, 8 Opposition the opportunity of using time against us.

4      Perhaps more important than the problems wliich .w nCan &quot;e^^^r&apos;

those which at this stage are clouds on the horizon     WJ ^gS^: ^at the WageS Bill may well require expansion into a more wideJgXgfc ^Ployment Bill.    We are also aware of the pressure       1 e k ^er in the year for new legislation on the removal of l&quot;*  ?}^ businesses.    There is also uncertainty about the extent to which


legislation on the coal industry will be required in the   9 5-86 S easion. And the Secretary of State for the Environment thinks thet   ^   \the Session in which he might have to seek urgent le8 lation on political

Advertising by local authorities.    We have only bee f  anc* f r them

 &amp;or. in&apos;mind; we cannot, and have not, made jpecific allowance or them &lt;$hin the programme which we are recommending to Cabinet         ? be

rtV) f    o ,       -c    ii  these eventualities require

M&gt;  fi&gt;r tn rnl 1pa?ues    however,  that it an Lnesc cvc

*8SS&amp;  we&apos;shail almost&apos;certainly be in the position of having to atfsndc^ome of the Bills which we have selected.

5. tf^lUtion to the uncertainties which hang over us, we have of courae^gSfer of contingent Bills which, by definition   become essential if certTSSntingenciea arise.    It seems almost mevitable   ha   some of these wiSSe needed and that some will prove particularly dif ^ult for example the^Channel Fixed Link (which will be hybrid) and Local Government (Commissioners), which is already drafted, but which will be extremely contentious.

6. Our selectiOs^had to pay some account to the need to balance the programme as betwSf%erent sizes and types of Bills as -el^s tb fSe which can be introdW^ the House of Lords rather   han the House of Commons.    We have als^U concerned that Bills should be adequately Prepared - this is alt&amp;fae difficult than my colleagues suppose. Anally, we have to tak^&amp;mt of the realities of &apos;&quot;l&quot; &apos;&quot;* rMM Programming.    We do thertfX^eel strongly that our suggested programme of 33 Bills is a maximum. &lt;^ j)

7. This does of course mean^^e have had to reject a number of very significant candidates.    PerhaS^most important of these ^Housing. The Secretary of State for the Sf^/p^nent argued strongly for the introduction^ legislation on th^tation of hous&quot;8 J*&apos;^^ his grants and on the private rented sW&amp;We recognise the       e        of his faints in both these areas, but felPu^e to accept that his Bill should have a place in this programme.    Poli^gfc long *ay ^&quot;/&quot;&quot;J &quot;J&quot;6* and this would be a large and contenti^^l to take late into an already crowded programme.

8- The second Bill of this kind is Crown Agents.    A Bill to continue a Power to waive interest owed by the Crown Agents to the Government is

essential.    To this, however,  the Foreign and Co/^Wealtl;nSe&quot;e^^ment w^hed to add the powers to privatise the Crown fifeetWs.    In the judgment of the Committee, it did not seem likely that prNWJ^tion was a Poetical proposition in the timescale he was sugg^(tj^i and we did not therefore feel that we could take up valuable sPac^^^ 8^ tb-is part of his legislation.    We accordingly suggesr^th^the Lrown Agents Bill should be limited strictly to the essentia^^sions ^cessary to continue the waiver of interest.    We do  fV^g/&quot; ^^e political problems that this will cause, but consider ^^n balance lc would be best for the Government to take this course. N^T/^v

9- We had originally felt able to include Petroleum, but pr^on the Programme convinced us that it should be replaced by Atomic En *&lt;J^^


Authority, which is shorter, will be ready earlier and is equally desired kby the Secretary of State for Energy.

PROGRAMME

W)We have provisionally selected three Bills for a P^ce in 1986-87 Wpmme.    This is still a relatively new feature, but I think that it hJ lft.ady paid dividends with the Building Societies and Financial Se^Sosills in the 1985-86 Session, which have reached an advanced stat&lt;?^reparation as a result of being given firm places last year. We concluS^W Copyright, Petroleum and Criminal Justice should be given firm pEKonv.    We consider that a maximum of five places should be awarded &amp;%nis way; the other two may emerge from discussion m Cabinet.

TIMETABLES

U.    Finally   couijtS emphasise once more the importance of maintaining or improving the ti^taWles for the preparation of Bills as set out m the detailed schedul^p?3Qjnex B.    If instructions are not received by Parliamentary CounaVQ)til late July it will almost certainly mean that Bills of any size w^ *#t be ready by the beginning of the Session. A key feature of the ad^femanagement of the legislative programme is a fortnight of Second ReW&amp;\of significant Bills at the beginning of the Session.    The further we^aV^to depart from introductions of majoi early in the Sessiori) the m^sLikely we are to run into difficulties and to have to drop Bills at a^Qjstage in their preparation. Hi only embarrassing, it is inS^nt.    The Lord Privy Seal must therefore be informed immediately if th&lt;^^any likelihood of failure to meet the agreed timetable for the despab^t^&apos;instructions.

CONCLUSIONS

i2     I therefore invite colleagues

a. approve the list of essential^^ramme and uncontroversial Bills at Annex A;

b. note the contingent Bills also listed at Annex A and agree that they should be brought forward if necessary;_^^

c     agree that up to five Bills should beOa firm place now in the 1986-87 programme and that Copyright, P tto*mta and Criminal Justice should be included; v^^xO

d.     accept the need for all Departments to adher/g^r im?r V^. n the state of timetables for the preparation of Bir^ o$ which are responsible.
