Nineteen public hearings have u6en neld.

THE CASE FOR REFORM ft

over-   e case for reform is that r J^ial security system leads to it  g      lance  n the State;  it pre^0|l^^oo large a share of resources; and is&quot;0*&quot; we^ targeted;  it is  in daw ^^: breaking down administratively s too complex for people to undel^^Wk

rePresPendln8  n social security now totl^fi^er  40 billion a year and Gross nntS a*most a third of all public spending.    The proportion of cent to ?estlc Product taken up by social s^^Wi-^ has risen from 4.7 per s0cial        Per cent since the start of Nat iorta^^^urance in 1948. If

Present86011^1&quot;^ sPending were allowed to contimie to grow, as it would on resour   p l*-c*-es,  it would pre-empt an even larger share of Government cost of   &gt;,anC* put tne Government&apos;s overall economic strategy at risk. The eventu n    .State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) alone will (if pens&quot;:y lncrease spending on pensions in real terms bi jjover  20 billion uPrat- ^sl ns are uPrated by prices) or  35 billion (iffcK%Lons are Ced ^ earnings).

that ne,     .x h the present level of spending the evidence ^fr^^k review is that the    Lb.not being targeted to those most  in need.    Our  sMrch shows  Ver the ? Slt^on or the retired population has improved very considerably famiiies    3St  ^ years.    Against  that, however,  it is clear thYt^J^r deludes Wltl1 _cnildren now emerge as the group most in need. Tn^dfW not just the unemployed but poor families where the head^^W^te


araily is working.     For low paid workers with children the gap between income in and out of work is narrow and it is here that we have the worst ects of the unemployment trap.

jff^    Two-thirds of the population are now entitled to social security M yments and the resulting pressure on the administration of the system is

Ey?lS^e      In particular, the supplementary benefit system which now dojJl8kVS ne^P ^or some  four million claimants  is  in danger of breaking o ^i^^Currently some 36,000 staff (out of a total social security staff 0)000) are working on supplementary benefit alone.

made ^ 3 resu^-t  ^ tne ad hoc additions to the social security system co   i Ver tne iast       years we now have a system of bewildering

P exity   tor supplementary benefit the rules of entitlement are so of ia6X tliat tne guidance to the staff is contained in a two-volume guide ken    &apos;^00 sections and an index of 43 pages.    The complexities of housing re PUt ^E\fein on local authorities while the evidence of market

rch shows that there is considerable public ignorance of benefits llk* the SERFS. \JL

ij     Above all,  perhaps,  the balance between the State and the individual re Wr n?*    The social security system currently gives too much earn nSibility t0 the^^tVand too little to the individual. The ThisX(H^S  rS^ated pension^^^me is one - but only one - example of this. thtt    minance by the Stare was never intended by Beveridge who believed there were important roles for both the State and the individual.

PRINCIPLES OF REFORM

sec       e Pr gramme  for reform buBM^  the basic principles that social betwee^ &quot; not.a.funct

ion of the State alone.    It  is a partnership Most 60 Lndividual and the Stat^L^^g_sys tem built on twin pillars.

thenis^0^6 only can Dut wish to^h^^^sens ible provision for

wiSh toVeS* F r exatnPle&gt; tbey wish to^j^^^their own pension just as they encour tne*r own house.   The organisation of social security should

Parti lndiviclual to make his own i^^^ion while recognising the

devel resP nsibility of the Governmen^^^^lp those in need. In

0j     Resources should be directed more effectively to meet the areas 0n^reatest need.    This does not mean that benefit should be provided

to those in need.    Retirement pensions and child benefit will ^evain basic benefits on which the individual can bugjld. (-he^rtheless,  if we are to bring extra help to tnivKf greatest need

we must target the resources we have as effectively as Possible. A

b.     Th .

Gove s cial security system must be consistent with^yie^

pre rnment&apos;s overall objectives for the economy.    It musc^d^m emPt too large a share of the nation&apos;s resources.    Thy^Jkl


security system should not discourage people from helping themselves and should certainly not be a barrier to employment.    The public should be aware of the costs of the system and the retention of the ^        contributory principle helps here.

c.     xhe social security system should be simpler for the public to understand and better administered.    This means replacing the ^^^k^laborate system of supplementary benefit with a system of income ^J^Pport;  and simpler structures for both housing and family support.

PROGRAMME FOR REFORM

 j*     The programme for reform, which is outlined below and set out in the

Green Paper annexed to this paper,  follows from the problems and gecnciPles 1 have identified.    The proposals for each area of social Qk. rity are designed to achieve the best balance between the various ^jectives wS^ML trying to meet.    At the same time, we can achieve better

operation^^J^egration between the Inland Revenue and Department of the SocH^^M:urity (DHSS) systems, particularly in the light of

j     computerisar^M^gkogrammes now taking place.    Those issues are to be r her developed ^^^e Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Green Paper on

PENSIONS

My proposals for pensions are in two parts -

a&quot;     I believe that the SERPS should be ended - although clearly with accrued rights preserved.    The basic case against SERPS is that it Pre-empts public resources  p^^he next 50 years.    On the most modest assumption spending on pensions which is  15.4 billion today will nave risen to  45 billion by 2033.    Inevitably this would affect spending on other social prior^u^^Jike health and social services. n pensions terms alone SERPS do^^imhing for anyone who retired 0re  1978 and never will do so^jifl^the spread of occupational Pensions has virtually been ended existence of SERPS.

 *      In addition to the State basic pension I aim to have a system

er which virtually everyone in work^ al^yiave the right to an occupational pension or his own personal j^^^on.    In my view it is essential that SERPS should be replaced with a good alternative second tier.    Under my proposals the Government will set down a minimum contribution level of 4 or 5 per cent of earnings - split ween the employee and employer.    The effect will be that about en million extra workers will be covered by thel^^wn pension Provision. tR*

The c

P st award Vernment set down simple qualifying stancSH^^^limited

requireme    Inaexation and survivors benefits - and will alSTJ^^^ ParticuiantS the Providers of pensions.    We will not req^y^^^L

investment ^evels of benefits.    The pension resulting will dep*^|(^j the sector s u Performance of the scheme.    Existing occupational and public

ernes will automatically meet the new rules.    People wi^^C^ree


0 take out their own personal pension plan if they wish or join their k^p^over&apos;s scheme.    Employers and employees will also, of course, be free m      uild on the minimum provision we lay down.

 HjL  The effect of the change will be to prevent the build-up of an ^?jjemely large burden on public spending through SERPS.    The benefit is J|^^t will reduce the role of the State and give almost the whole PWulation a direct personal investment in their own future.

FAMILY SUPPORT

|p*    Tne main change I propose is to abolish Family Income Supplement on l    a?d ll^^pduce a new family credit to improve the targeting of help

 w ino^A^^rking families with children.    Family credit will be t^s Sed on ^flB^lar basis to the successor to supplementary benefit;

will pre ^^^ceople in work being worse off than if they were f am&apos; l*&apos;  yed&apos; &quot;^^L^B ^e calculated on net pay; this will mean that pa^ can beVky|^ being better ofL: as their pay rises.    It will be

wa 3 tnrough the t^^mcket as an offset to tax;  this wil I mean that sh S~eayners have aJ^Aer understanding of their total  family income and pre       lncrease wage flexibility.    It will be more tightly administered to vent the abuse to%xc^tflS has been subject.

    Family credit will represent a major improvement in the effectiveness subs*    sVPport f r families - now clearly the greatest priority.    It will Wors^antlally improve incentives for many on low incomes and prevent the USe     et^ects of the poverty and unemployment traps.    I also propose to welf   G aDoHtion of FIS to end  ]^%availability of free school  meals and Wl&apos;l1a|&quot; foods to those not on siMA^Untary benefit.    Instead a cash sum deluded  in the rates for*J^fl^ credit.

benefit^ propose ailv change iiir^&apos;^sis of child benefit. The

opin-      ls fiimple,  well understood anW^^ar, as was shown by a public reco       survey I commissioned.    It is t^^^y way in which we can now howeve1Se ^ costs of children for theTJJ^k.y of families.     I shall, reiaj--^5 ma^e some savings in the cost of child benefit to cover the er|J(|i^Vely small extra cost of introducing^pnol^ credit.    Because family famil* ^e a much more effective means or J^^ing poor working

*-ntrocieS&apos;  We w!*l also have greater flexibility following its DenefitCtl n&apos; ^n consldering the level of subsequent upratings of child

SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT ^

inco^ Pr Posals win replace the supplementary benef^^^me by a new ne~pT~^~~^P-P2 ^. scheme with a much smaller social aid sch^RU^ a &quot;safety It [s .. ack. Supplementary benefit is too complex and o^a^lkgulated. new Ln to aaminister and  its cost  is difficult to mt^i. The

assist     6 SupPort scheme will be much simpler.    It will prov^kjPW cla

Imant      tu Se*&quot; &apos;a&apos;:es  to a limited number of different categ^^B^^of needs-    \   .    ere will be no additional payments for individuallj^Jkesed lives&apos; w&gt;u^mants wil1 be leCt with the responsibility for managin^|h*Lr 1 hin the set rates.    This will cover the great majority


I   ^lrcumstances but the separate social, aid scheme will provide a fallback

r emergencies and will provide practical help to those with special ^wroblems.    The social aid scheme will, however, be much more closely

ontrolled,    it will be operated on a discretionary basis by DHSS local ?^Ppfc^ces to avoid legal entitlements to social aid being created; and ^O^TjR^^tUre De cash limited.    Within the income supporl   scheme there

J^me more generous  rules on the  treatment of capital and on the amounts e people, including some of the long-term unemployed, can earn. This improve incentives both to save and to regain contact with the labour market.

Jg^j ^e inUjoduction of the income support and social aid schemes will

to agr|^%cal simplification of our means-tested benefits system ben f   n^ ^flP  ti^cons is tent framework for the assessment of housing staff11&quot; ^BE!^ credit.    It will make  the system more  intelligible to

Cont    ii^ the^pjh-j-^; and it will ensure that costs are properly

H US1NG BENEFIT

pre reform of housing benefit will follow the same pattern. The

in scheme is h igfl^y jj|nplex~incons is ten t in  its treatmenl   of those

out  f work and j&amp;jWkt to rapid cost escalation.    It now extends hurP to  ^ar UP the income scale and insulates too many people from the gi    en  f Paying rates.    The reform of the scheme will have two main as        s*    It will base assessment of entitlement on the same income test Co    .    lncome support scheme so that those in and out of work are treated

income&apos;6&apos;&apos;17-   Ab Ve the

income support level, benefit will be reduced as Presen riS6S       a simple s traign^fBra-urd formula,  instead of, as at claiman&apos; ^ SePat&quot;ate tapers for r^Pb(l rates anil  for different   types of of     ant&quot;    This will have the ef fe^^^^ubstantial 1 y reducing the number People who get their rate bills Hbfem

benefit*6 Present scheme, however, means^^^all those on supplementary Scheme n  rates and, unless we changJra^k position,  the reformed

ir&gt;c0ns-W Uld insulate still more people fr^A^e increases.    This is governmetent-Wlttl tlie  bJectives and approa^^o^^he review of Local compl f.6111&quot; ^lnanee; we should be seeking to maJ^^^ire that nobody is that u d ^ lnsulated from the cost of local services.    I therefore propose should neW scheme the

maximum level of assistance with rates claimants ^estricteds  initially to 80 per cent.    This would apply to all announc     lncluding those on the new income support scheme.    I would need to6 ttl1^ cnange in principle in my Green Paper.    WaJ^uld, however, the ReviC nSlder  &apos;tS  implications  further in the light4K ie outcome of lew of Local Government Finance. ^&quot;w^Q^

received&lt;ii n        proPosa--s  those on supplementary benefit wo^d^Rttinue to to introd cent assistance with rents, as at present. ^^t^Lpropose

Cent of hU e        measures,  including direct reimbursement of^cM^^bo per the sChemeneflt costs to locn 1  authorities,  to ensure that theTjft^te

economically and use their powers to restrict benefit payments


where rents are excessive.    This will be particularly important if action is taken to deregulate private sector rents.    We would, however, need to keep the position under review and take further steps if it seemed that J^rents were rising faster than intended.

QfclER BENEFITS

^^ ^In addition to the major reforms above, I propose to make the  J^^ing changes in other areas -

a. Unemployment Benefit.   At present the great majority of the unemployed are on supplementary benefit, not unemployment benefit; hut many people in receipt of unemployment benefit need extra help from supplementary benefit.    To prevent this duplication I propose to brinAKkstructure of unemployment benefit in line with the new income support scheme - with the effect of increasing its rate but reducin^B^duration.

b. Widow^Selefits.    I propose to replace the short-term widows allowance-^ij3fcTy paid for six months) by a lump sum grant. Thereafter, ^KJLing benefits will be concentrated more on older widows and tho^E^Lh children.

c-      Death and &quot;*-J^- ^n&quot;*-g      These two National Insurance benefits have been^t^TfalTthe same cash value - which is now inadequate - for many years.    The result with death grant, for example,  is that the administration cost is now approaching the cost of the benefit.    The time has come to abolish both grants. Rather than universal grants we prop^e to provide better help to those who need it most.

d-     Maternity Allowance.    The National Insurance benefit, payable Eor 18 weeks around the time o%J5pfcnement, will be made more flexible and the qualification pFicI will be made more relevanl to working women.

e-      Students.    In line with our geiJSjktance that young people should not depend on social security benefits, I propose to announce  ur intention in principle to exclude Ifcud^ts from supplementary and housing benefits.    This will be carried ^w d in the light of the Secretary of State for Education and Science&apos;s review of student grants.

PINANCIAL AND STAFFING IMPLICATIONS

gl&apos;o   My reform proposals recognise that the social sec^jp^budget has res^ SharP1y and, unless steps are taken, will continue to grow. They savPOnd ln three ways:    first, by making structural changmgjich will thr6  8   railli n in 1987-88.    These changes should also sf^^^fween cost6 E Ur thousand staff and perhaps  20 million in adra^|^|ative

saviS*    Second,  the abolition of the SERPS will produce major4^^term shall831  5   miUion by 1993-94 and  22 billion by 2033-34.    Third, we make further progress in limiting our future liabilities ^^^^


yePlacirig the supplementary benefit scheme by a more tightly defined ncome support scheme and (for the first time) a cash limited social aid   f 6!    The housing benefit proposals will similarly help to limit llities by reducing the scope of the scheme and by making it more BWt icult for local authorities and private landlords to exploit it.

^jP^NTATION

pUDl-^ne conclusions of the review will be set out in a Green Paper to be p-^ac1Sned before Whitsun.    Main legislation will be required.    I have a ^ ace for the Bill in next Session&apos;s programme and have undertaken to have m   ^eady f r the beginning of the Session.    Even so, given its scope, we Re     assuine^^t it will not gain Royal Assent until the summer of 1986. train31&quot;10118 WOjA^ then have to be laid; instructions written; and staff ained.    Employers and local authorities will also be involved. The Prac^km^ne date for implementation is therefore April 1987.

PRESENTING THE ^ftpf^LS

pre dra^t GreeiA^r shows how I intend to make the case  for and

R.  tne reforms.    The central themes which the reform package will  ^Phasise are -

a*     A better balatree between State and private provision. The Proposals on retirement will give everyone the right to their own Pension through their job in addition to the basic National Insurance Pension.

p&quot;   .   Better direction of rvw 8 towards priority areas. The amiliy credit scheme will mKJf^ceal impact on the poverty and UnemPloyment  traps and improv^HKlentives for low paid workers with chUdren. ^BSL

Simplification Qf tne SOcial security system.    The new income uPport scheme will be simpler to Lm J|kand and less subject to cost escalation.    it will also provide a consistent and coherent basis for assessing entitlement to all the meanlO^B%Kd benefits.

d*     Better control of the seemingly inel^^DT.e growth of social

rity spending.    The main short-term savings will come from the aim rm  ^ nousing benefit which will also give strong support to our i m  ^ increasing accountability in local government.    The major ng-term savings arise from the SERPS.

Provision^nt  e^^ect the reforms will provide a system\of social security which r- n Wn^ctl me^ts our needs as a society, which we c^^^ ord and

can be managed efficiently.

5 eial security system should be seeta*9 jLals and obscured,   our responsibilities as indiv d. Coll ctively through the State have been left


1.4 This Green Paper aims to define a system which 1 founded on public understanding of the purposes and the^e

workings of social security; which is more relevant to

 i-Vip demands

needs of today; and which is capable of meeting w

It sets

we shall face over the next quarter of a century.

&apos; s s s

out a new approach to social security - but it recogm and seeks to build on what has been achieved over forty years.

The twin pillars

1.5 Fundamental to this approach is a belief that the

,    Hased on a system of social security provision should ne d*3

clear understanding of the relative roles and

responsibilities of the individual and the State. rinCiple

building for the future we should follow the basic p^one&gt;

that social security is not a function of the State a

j the State

It is a partnership between the individual ana system built on twin pillars.

1.6 Most people not only can but wish to make s

provision for themselves.   The organisation of so

security should encourage that.    It should respect

.  j ces an*-1

ability of the individual to make his own cnox^ ^ time

take responsibility for his own life.   But at    ^ ^ it must recognise the responsibility of gover ^ aS

establish an underlying basis of provision on w    tiweS of individuals can build and on which we can rely need.

1.7 Such an approach does not lead, as some hav ^^eX suggested, to a system based on a single concep &apos; ts it be universality or means-testing.   For su ^ goCi almost invariably concern only the State dimen ^ provision.   They regard State provision as goo      tle as they postulate that it should do as much or as      ^ state possible.   Either analysis misses the centra P


. r le in supporting and sustaining provision has an important roie j. qeif-reliance the individual; but it should not discourage se or stand in the way of individual provision responsibility.

 ~ thp 1942 report of This was a central theme in the w

Sir William Beveridge:

   .   security should not stifle The State in organising securi v ,

resoonsibility/ -L&quot; incentive, opportunity, re^ should leave room

fV,pn    The ability  &quot;* has changed in the forty years since has

 f most people to make more of their own Pr q  hQme

1,9     Yet the scope and scale of the br.a q 

sYstem has extended greatly.   The decision at       ^ ^

National Insurance to pay pensions at once r

a ^ild-up of entitlement substantially dent

that the new system was insurance based, m

of ^rnings-related benefits and contributions

Really different from Beveridge&apos;s concept.

of national

l&apos;10    We should not be deceived about the nature     ^ ^ prance.   It is not the same as private insur 0

liability to be met by our children.    Even with the

elaborate State earnings-related pension scheme the

contributor is doing no more than helping to pay f r the

  ~ a claim tu

present cost of pensions.   His own entitlement is &lt;*

t ributoi5

a pension which he hopes future generations of conw-will finance.

1.11 Forty years on there is little point in seeking to

.    . .   the state

replicate private insurance arrangements inside ui ^e

organisation.   We should certainly recognise the debt

is

building up for the future.    But the better course      ^ ^e distinguish between what can and should be organised i private sector and what can and should be organised Government.   This is what the twin pillar system s    ^n but do.    It recognises the importance of the State provi it seeks to define its limits.

t believe

1.12 In developing this approach the Government numj3er that the social security system should aim to meet

of important objectives.

*ble of *eeting First, the social security system must be capao

genuine need.

. No mvernitieri1&quot;

This is a basic responsibility of any ^       ^ t^ ng individual should be left in a position we ^^if no fault of his own he is unable to susta^sed on or his family.    Supplementary benefit is ^ it is

that principle and - while it has many faU ovets^&apos; more effective than many equivalent schemes ibie

must be

At the same time the overall system mus ^ enough to recognise that what constitUt^d aiso changes and that those groups most in ne      ^e has change.   Over the last half century the P familieS changed markedly.    In the 1930s working-3

were seen as the main group in poverty:   the mam causes being unemployment and low earnings among men with large families.   By the 1950s and 1960s Pensioners were the major cause for concern.   Now the Position has changed again and in 1985 it is families with children who face the most difficult problems.

^ond&apos; the social security system must be consistent with the Government&apos;s overall objectives for the economy.

It is an essential part of the Government&apos;s economic strategy that the share of national resources consumed by the public sector should be curtailed. Social security, is already by far the largest Government programme - more than twice defence spending and larger than health, social services, education and housing put together. Because social security pre-empts such a large part of public expenditure and is growing so rapidly it mustput the Government&apos;s economic strategy at risk.   Many other countries find themselves in a similar situation and ^ere is widespread agreement internationally on the n*ed to take stock.   But there are also wider issues. While it is one of the functions of the social security system to help those who are unemployed, it is self-defeating if it creates barriers to the creation of jobs, to job mobility or to people ^joining the labour force.   Clearly such obstacles exist if people believe themselves better off out of * rk than in work; or if employers regard the burden ar*d administration of national insurance as a substantial discouragement to providing new jobs. Equally restrictions in areas like pensions can discourage people from changing jobs.    If we wish to encourage individuals to provide for themselves then ^e social security system - public and private -mu-st not stand in the way.


Third, the social security system must be simpler to understand and easier to administer.

Forty years of tinkering have resulted in comple*lty and confusion.   Nobody can be happy with the system as it stands today.   The supplementary benefit sy alone requires some 36,000 staff to administer The rules of entitlement are so complex that the guidance to staff runs to two volumes and 16,0   sections.   Nor is it only the rules which cause confusion.   All the main means-tested heneflts supplementary benefit, housing benefit and f&apos;am1^CQX&amp;e income supplement - use different measures of 1 and capital.   While the evidence suggests        &apos; d the public, schemes like the State earnings-re^^s pension are shrouded in an obscurity which Qf is virtually total.   As for administration, ffices the social security system is run from local which largely lack the kind of aids which mo e   ^ ^ computer science can provide.   The result i taff service for the public too often fails as the hunt for files in a Dickensian paper-chase.

are not independent of each other.   At times choi ejne

the obJ

resources on those who needed them most.   Yet luSion

of relieving need does not lead simply to the co      .^g, It

that the State should provide only where all else pr0vide

is an entirely proper function for the Government^

particular, such support can come at times when imited

high (as when raising children) or when income

(as in retirement).   Here Government is underpinn^

!-H    The Government&apos;s proposals are not based on g

CHAPTER 2:    THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY

2.1 By any measure the Beveridge Report of 1942 was landmark in the development of social security provis ^ Britain.    But social security did not start witn e&lt;=

He was building on advances made in the first forty Ve

the twentieth century, advances which in his words

produced a social security system &apos;on a scale not ^ and hardly rivalled in any other country of the world

those who

2.2 The early role of the State in supporting ^

could not support themselves was, as with the Poor ^

simply to avoid extreme destitution.   Any help bey

2.6 Beveridge&apos;s plan for social security was ess&lt;=

no doubt that this - &quot;rather than free allowances instate1    - was what the British people wanted.

2.7 It followed that at the heart of Beveridge s ^

was the contributory principle:   contributors recei     ^ ^t

payment when they experienced a particular contingency

retirement or unemployment. But he was convinced

State should not take over all responsibility from ctate

benefits were to be generally flat-rate and at subsi

level. Contributions were also flat-rate,   ah a for people - rich or poor - would pay the same conw.       mf for the same security.   This distinguished his scheme        .ued as instance, the New Zealand system which Beveriay        er the an income tax assigned to a particular service.        ^ ^ Beveridge scheme all contributions would be paid i ^ single social insurance fund and all insured bene from it.

2.14 When, therefore, there are calls to prese

they need to be examined carefully.   Beveriage ^      ^ haS social security was radically changed at the o       ciple he carried on being changed since.

Those who argue for no structural cnang^hemseives in at the edges should not be allowed to envelop the mantle of Beveridge.   They are arguing f r status quo.

2.15 But Beveridge&apos;s purpose was not to ProdUC r0in &apos;a structures for their own sake.   His plan spran^rveyS car^e diagnosis of want&apos;6.    It was based on social s ^at out in Britain in the 1930s and aimed at ensur

In this the State haa ^ antral role but not an exclusive one.   It was W- Plan that there should be co-operation between  * the individual.   To what extent have these aspirations been realised?


CHAPTER 3:    SOCIAL SECURITY TODAY

3.1 Spending on social security1 (including

administration) has increased sixty-fold since the start

the cost

national insurance.    That is five times as fast as

of living.    This year it will total over  40 billi n a

represent almost a third of all public spending.   The ^m

proportion of GDP taken up by social security has risen

  j    Even iu

4.7 per cent to 11.0 per cent over the same period. g the last fifteen years this proportion has increased by than half.

CHAPTER 6:    FACING UP TO THE FUTURE

6.1      The Government believe that the case for reforming our system of social security provision is clear. In

both to

putting forward proposals the Government are seeking provide a coherent basis for social security in the fu^d and to tackle the real problems which have been identi We believe the time for reform is right and the need f r reform is urgent.

6-2       First, the Government believe that the financial

issues must be faced now.   The escalating cost or

security must be controlled now and contained for the

future.    In particular we have built ourselves a State

*n expect ^

earnings-related pension scheme from which we axx for.

benefit in the future but which none of us is paying

ct and rxie

It is our children who will have to meet the cosi- ^e burden will be too great.   We should act now to res ^ proper balance between basic State and private proVlShis 0wn We should make sure that everyone contributes now occupational or personal pension.

ources must i&gt;e

6.3       Second, the Government believe that reso

- crreatesi-

directed more effectively to meet the areas oi y vided

need.    This does not mean that benefit should be P

only to those in need.   We believe that, for i   &lt;-ionerS

-     v,r to penS

State should provide basic support as of rignt ^ a

and families with children.   But we do not accept^     eS an greater spread of universal benefits is right- indiVidual over-important role to the State; it undermines jf we

self-reliance; and it leads always to greater cos ^ want to see the money we spend on social seCUr^t^me effectively, we must accept that this involves s      ^ thoSe redistribution between different groups of pe0pl^hoSe in the greatest need are to get more help/ tnen conStructin^ need less help will get less.   We have to avoid c^ich g  *&apos; systems, such as we now have in housing benefit/


     pd to give limited means-tested from being schemes designed tog much wider

help to those most in need, until resources we

that the system should 6-4     Third, the Government believe ^ gee a

^ simpler. The evidence shows that p ^ simpler simpler and more comprehensible system* benefits and

of entitlement, less duplication ^ween^ ^ ^tveen public and private provision. supplementary ^erlap between unemployment beneii between State and

We intend^ nc^e support based Elementary benefit with a system of i       ^ ^ not on detailed regulation and needs- complication. Reasonable support for all with the minim rQugh t0 form the

that simple structure can be carrie support. ba*is also of our systems of housing and family

6,5     Fourth, the Government believe the s^      gtaff are be*er administered.   At present more than 8 . ^ Cloyed in DHSS on social security and tn y      ^ feoth of e^aged in an endless paper-chase to the ^ strategy

the Department and will include, to work with them on a part-time advisory basis, a number of experienced manager from outside the Civil Service.

6.6 Fifth, the Government believe we must not undermin

.   . - w*. ran ensure

individuals&apos; willingness to help themselves, we that people, particularly families with children, do find themselves better off on benefit than in worK no advantages from greater work effort.   We can help unemployed people to maintain contact with the labour&apos; ^ market.   And we can do more to help people to secure own pensions.

6.7 Above  11, the Government believe in restoringgion. proper partnership between State and individual ProV alg0 There is an important role for the State but there

one for the individual.   The Government must enco ^ ^ ^e individuals to meet costs which they should bear strong, appropriate personal provision. This will create ^ new partnership between the State and the indivi

6.8 It is with these objectives in mind that the:    ^ 0f Government have formulated their proposals for       ^ hene*&quot;^ social security.    The proposals for each area o ^^ned in system are outlined in succeeding chapters and e ^ more detail in Volume 2.    The proposals for each ^ provision are designed to achieve the best and which appropriate balance between the different objec    ^ ^e

the system should seek to achieve, taking acco

,   of th sc

current pattern of provision and the needs system system now serves.   The intention is to aclueV^e c0untry which serves the varying needs of people and    ^ a single best, rather than a system which is determined ^ objective or which places too great a weight o mechanisms for delivering benefits.


6-9     Thus, we consider it right   o     ^   unemployment and system for contingencies like retir&lt;fiect!Lon of the State to long-term sickness.   It is not the func      there is a real be the sole provider of these beneflt%      and the ^lue in retaining a link between benefr  ^ ^ contributions paid to earn entl^lem6*   ict insurance contributory system is not based on        royides a valuable Principles, and never has been, but 1   P see *eans for determining entitlement^ p        M as

or precluding action in other priority areas.   One       ^ a consequence of this increased role for the State would reduction in the extent to which individual provision encouraged or could be afforded.

6.12     The Government believes it is right to look systern

the objectives which each part of the social security

best be

should seek to meet and how those objectives can

responsibility to see that the mechanisms for deliv

CHAPTER 7:    PROVISION FOR RETIREMENT

laHve position

7.1 The most crucial decisions about the relative v

the are3

of the individual and the State have to be made m ^ of pension provision.   All the evidence is that member occupational schemes place great value on belonging private pension scheme:    those without such private       Qg a would like to have it if they could.   Yet in the mld^ending giant step was taken in the opposite direction by unfunded State cover.

7.2 The State earnings-related pension scheme pr ^lated that retirement pensioners will receive an earnin^SUn(jer the pension in addition to their basic State pension. gince scheme the best twenty years of qualifying earnings _ 1978 are revalued to the date of retirement in line engion national average earnings and the earnings-related P

is not enough for an employer to guarantee a   e      ^ ^ the contribution to a pension.   The workings of thi ^ceiiti^e State scheme are undeniably complicated but the ^ ^e coSt for the employer to face this and bear the r nation&amp;l being more than he had bargained for is a lower insurance contribution.   The State also ott

res ecomes Payable the State in effect takes on the

the    6   by occupational schemes.    The other half comes from Payment- *

that second-tier State pensions.   On the basis

that PenS*ons are uprated in line with prices this will mean have Spendlng on Pensions which is 115.4 billion today will  27 _reachecl  17.9 billion by 1993;  .21 billion by 2003;

7.4

SErj&gt;s ^-nevitable burden is but one of the drawbacks of

SeriQ1&apos;    lS Government believe that it suffers from other uus defects.

  EQig^of the State:    the Government&apos;s first duty should be to look after today&apos;s pensioners. SERPS

es n thing for anyone who retired before 1978 and never win do so.    it would be an altogether more

GovSible dlvision of responsibility for the

rnment to concentrate on providing as good a  Dasic no

pension as possible and on assisting those who sect^ 6Xtra nelp in retirement; while the private r should concentrate upon providing additional ions with the aim of extending such cover to as y  f the population as possible.

^^^Hal provis-inn-    occupational pension cover is ^   !c and has been discouraged by SERPS. The CQnt exity of the State scheme&apos;s provisions on

acting-out and the open-ended commitment that


employers have to take on has meant that there h

ion coverage

been little increase in occupational pensio&quot; ^

in industries like agriculture, construction ctuj:e

distribution.   The present contracting-out s

The most a slight

is that national insurance contributions show o are percentage rise, given that the earnings on w    ^ ^at levied will rise.   A more realistic assessment

We remain committed to direct provision in tn ^-national insurance__reUr^^ we wiU

entitlement earned by the payment of contrlbU^ value. and c ntinue to ensure that the pension retains 1 tion ^t extra help goes to pensioners who need it. p^V *** remains as to the future of the earnings-related of the state scheme.

7-8      A possible approach here would be to reduce the Urging cost of SERPS.   one way of achieving this

reducing the rate of accrual on earnings above a certain level;

no longer giving full additional pension JJ*^ , twenty years&apos; contributions, basing lifetime&apos;s earnings; and

making contracted-out schemes responsible  V. inflation-proofing the guaranteed ^ v&apos;rice

to a maximum of 5 per cent a year or index, whichever was lower.


7.9 Those who support such an approach argue that sER^ came at the end of a long period of debate on pensions that there is now a degree of stability - although that stability would go if Labour&apos;s plan for a national

p ever to

investment bank and direction of pension funds were be put into operation. Although the Government see apparent attraction of clinging to at least part of SERPS structure, we believe that stronger arguments pr

7.10 Even a reduced scheme would still lead to a

a biiii n

substantial extra pensions bill rising to  19. o 2003 and  31.2 billion by 2033.   All the complexities implicit in the present scheme would be retained, possibly exaggerated.   And the barrier which SERFS ^ represents to the expansion of personal and occupati ^vate provision would remain.    The Government believe provision is the right way to augment the basic ^e pension and that this is an area in which the- * t aS

State should be minimised.    It is better to ensure ^ many people as possible contribute to their own Pen making their own savings to prepare for their  wn ^ retirement.   That is what many people already do g^er. Government believe that is what the public woulde^ded -Accordingly it is proposed that SERPS should be e      ^ q{ although all rights earned since the scheme began course, be honoured in full.

7.11 Although the State&apos;s prime concern shou iofl first pillar of pension provision - the basic P   ^ ^s0 has provided through the National Insurance system      ^ private a responsibility to ensure that the second pl****ion.

St* a+-  

e lnvolvement in private provision should be kept to the

ninimum. what is required is for the State to establish the ground mi

-Luj.es upon which employees and employers can base ^ Visions.

7 .12 rnu,

e ending of SERPS will make it unnecessary to

retain th

e c mplex system of controls and contribution

ar    gements which now govern contracting out. These

gements were created to ensure some notional parity  etween th

ne State and occupational schemes and because of

of ^financial interdependence of the two.   With the ending ot SErps th

7&apos;13 Yet

Private &amp; Government believe that minimum standards of

irresrj   Pr vision must still be laid down.    It would be tho&lt;=Q    Slble to end the State scheme without ensuring that

Who h

CHAPTER 8:    PROVIDING FOR CHILDREN

8.1 The principle that we should give financial support

to those who bear the extra responsibility of bringing UP^

children is one to which this Government are committed.

acknowledges not only the duty to ensure that children

should not face hardship, but also the importance of

    nur own

supporting family life and those who are ensuring  Ui future by caring for the next generation.    It is a Prl which is acknowledged by almost all countries by eitherfits concessions in their tax systems or the payment of hene or both.

8.2 In this country the basis of provision has chang substantially over the years.   The original Beveridge concept was that there should be a system of family allowances for all except the first child to Provid^ds 0f family with sufficient support to meet the basic ne ^ its children.   He regarded it as reasonable to expe ts incomes of those in work to meet at least the living

of the parents and one child but recognised that ^at

families with more than one child could not manage

the War-

such families had suffered particularly before

the level

8.3 But when family allowances were introduced,      ^ ^

of allowance was lower than he suggested.   What i ^r

allowances were not regularly uprated and so lost raSted

value.   As a result, the family allowance system n in

+  for chii

unfavourably with the more generous support i         ^ rate

the rest of the social security system.   Higher ^^nce

help was paid to those with children on national 1 jjies

benefits and higher age-related help was given entary

8.7 The Government&apos;s strategy of raising tax

and thus reducing the burden of taxation on low incom

families is an important part of the answer to thes ^_

problems.   The increases announced in the Budget m

i term5&apos;

tax thresholds are over 20 per cent higher in r jounced than in 1978/9.    The changes to national insuran efamiiies in the Budget will also mean that the lowest paid ^ will pay less in contributions.   But the raising  ^oUgh they thresholds and changes in contributions, helpful are, will not be sufficient to meet the Governinentroin0rity purpose.   Because families with children are in

among low-income households, such means cannot

But many re concerned themselves primarily with that aim an stance largely ignored the question whether the social as ^ scheme was continuing to meet the needs of the daJ^t as it could.    The Government&apos;s proposals tackle question directly.

9.2 At present the scheme suffers from tnre6.&quot;^t for problems.   First it is too complex.    It is d^f^ containS a claimants to understand and for staff to run. being mass of detailed rules, with the basic provisions overlaid by a series of qualifications, details       ult js specifications and exceptions to the rules. ^ how that many claimants have little real understann^itied to-their benefit is worked out or what they are ^^ledqe *h0 Help may therefore go to those with the best        ^ AJld

problems of housing benefit, for instance, has arisen

the lack of a common basis for assessing income s^p^ created

The result is housing benefit supplement - a bene tary

CHAPTER 10  : PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES

10.1 Apart from pensions, the national insurance system provides cover for unemployment, sickness, maternity an^ug death.   But the development of these benefits - their their relevance and the conditions governing them varied considerably.    They are therefore best looked at separately.

Providing for unemployment

10.2 Unemployment benefit was designed to be the support for people who lose work.    It was to be earne contributions paid in previous work and paid for up

year.   But only half of those becoming unemployed re   ^ ^ unemployment benefit and a fifth of those have it topP by supplementary benefit straightaway.   Taking the unemployed as a whole, about two-thirds are entirely^^ dependent on supplementary benefit.   The overlap gntary the two benefits - unemployment benefit and supple^rQin 0ne benefit - is confusing for claimants who may move to the other.    It also leads to complication in administration.   The two benefits are handled i offices by DHSS and the Department of Employment.

10.3 Unemployment benefit, in its present for / ^ ceased to be the main support originally intend^us been contributory basis of unemployment benefit has ^ devalued.   People who think themselves insured a t a unemployment find that the insurance beneti^    ^ dependS rate little higher than supplementary benefit a aS contribution tests which refer back to periods x   ^e peoPle much as two years earlier.   These tests often * ^i0*0*&apos; who have only recently joined or rejoined the ^^ef^ If they have children they may need to have

topped up by supplementary benefit.


Mo i*  

er&apos; if they turn to supplementary benefit for support, res ^ave to run down their capital, and to use up

th  UrCes which might have helped them to set up in business

s Ves&apos; before they can qualify for it.    The present

system al i + 

a J-L too often fails to provide a breathing space for

re^    y unemployed person during which he can continue to fiene ^ ^S  Wn res urces and an adequate contributory before he has to seek income-tested assistance.

IO.4 Th

Government are therefore considering - and would welcome vi**.

strUct on &quot; the possibility of moving to a new

e for unemployment benefit under which:

benefit would be payable for six months only;

the structure of the benefit would be

aligned with that of the income support scheme

(ie including allowance for children);

the rates of benefit would be set above the income support scheme levels; and

entitlement would be related more closely to a test of regular recent employment than under the Present complex contribution conditions.

Uiiempx 6 the advantage of ensuring that newly

SuPport      peoPle did not need to apply to the income ^ iucentheme ^        first six months&apos;&apos; it would increase ^toplify   1Ve to resume employment quickly; and it would

^dminist-        scneme both for claimants and in terms of Nation.


Providing for maternity

. j_j two forms

10.5 The national insurance scheme has proviaea u

of payment to assist mothers at the time their ^^^^^iq

born:    a single payment of a flat-rate grant, now aval

j a weeKJ-y

to all mothers without any contribution test; ana ^

allowance paid for a period to mothers who have been

j. js deair

regular work and paid contributions.    The grant j.=&gt; ^ with separately in the next section of this chapte section concentrates on the allowance, which has the ^ essential purpose of replacing the mother&apos;s earnings^ ^ period around the birth of her child to enable her up work.   This allowance is complemented by mater  which is paid by.employers to women who have worked^ continuously for the same employer for two years give up work to have a child.

10.6 The Government propose to retain both mater^orkjng

allowance and maternity pay to provide income f r ,

+- the Ti^

women who give up work to have a child.   Bur ^ ^ insurance maternity allowance will be changed. QwaI1ce unemployment benefit, entitlement to maternity a^cent will be based more closely on a test of regular t^on employment rather than the present complex contri rS

conditions which often relate to a period up previously.   And the period during which matern ^eCted allowance is paid - from eleven weeks before ^ ^re

week of confinement to six weeks after - will up flexible to allow women more choice about when work.

Maternity grant and death grant

.   the 0ri&lt;?inal

10.7 These two grants were included in c0gts

national insurance scheme to cover the imme gential associated with birth and death - providing eS^iding f r 3 equipment and clothing for a new child and P

Provision for widowhood

pnt system

10.9 There have been many changes since the prese gly

of benefits for widows was introduced, which make it

to reappraise this area of provision too. Society

10.10 The present benefits date from days when i

married women worked.   Today two thirds of all ma

with children over school age, and over a half of wl

at-t-ern oi

between 40 and 60, go to work.    The present patu ^

ceased to be responsible for bringing up children- (^ere is

on the following 10-13   The Government would welcome viewB ^

Proposals, which have been drawn up w ced by a single

10.14 This would, in the Government&apos;s view, be a system

better attuned to current circumstances.   Widowhood is a

contingency for which an increasing number of people can

The twin

continue to grow rapidly, as it has in the past.  &quot; pillar approach justifies some re-thinking so that the State&apos;s contribution is reduced and concentrated on thos who have the greatest need.

Provision for sick and disabled people

10.15 The present review of social security has not

included benefit? for disablement.   The Government s &amp;l&amp;it

objective here, as elsewhere, would be to secure a ^e

and better targetted system, concentrating resources

But to-plan for this, better and more up-to-date in

The last survey of this kind is oV   &amp; it fifteen years old : it had significant gaps, and s ^ was conducted a number of new disablement benefits nce been introduced.    The new survey will provide u ^ needed to enable this important set of benefits reviewed in their turn.

10.16 In the field of short-term sickness a ma:, hich &amp;cco^ has already been carried through, on principles oVerlaP entirely with the approach in this Green Paper. been between State and private occupational provis which a rationalised by the new statutory sick pay schemean&lt;j is t0

illness or injury . state benefit will be paid only to ^ose who do not qualify for payment by their employers whose incapacity for work is long term.

&quot;.17   The Government-s detailed proposals for benefitsfor ^employed people, maternity, and widowhood, are sen Chapter 5 of Volume 2.


CHAPTER 11  :  CONTRIBUTIONS AND FINANCES The contributory principle

11.1 The principle that entitlement to benefits sh U^ent related to contributions paid is one to which the G0V^eQ^ie remains committed.   An opinion survey1 has shown ^^J^ generally regard their contributions as not just a

tax.   They realise that they are earmarked to finance particular benefits, and consequently find them m ^t^on acceptable.   That preference for a separate contn must be recognised.

Die over 3

11.2 Some contributory benefits are to tide peop ^ temporary loss of earnings:   unemployment benefit^1^g 0J1/ most obvious example.   Others, like the retirement ^ng provide the certainty of a continuing income when. nterrUpted life is over, or (as with invalidity benefit) i

for a long period, or when a woman loses her n henefits earnings through widowhood.   As the cost of thes ^nCipie is met on a pay as you go basis, the contributory soCial

hut as a

can be seen not so much as social insurance d between compact - between those in work and those not, or^ n0t one generation and the next.    It is a compact w ^ become one-sided.    But it is right that people    ^ those should see that they are paying for the benefltSQwn ri9ntS who are not, and are in turn establishing their to those benefits when they need them.

which employers&apos; and employees&apos; contributions are levied.

It is right that employers as a group should share with

their employees the need to provide for the payment o

contributory benefits.   This implicit recognition o a^

common interest of employers and employees underlies

principle of an employer&apos;s contribution which is a       ^ ^

of most western social security systems.   But the purp

the employer&apos;s contribution is simply to raise ^

the National Insurance Fund.   No benefit rights hinge

CHAPTER 13: CONCLUSION

13.1 The social security system affects almost all o during our lives.    It grew out of Beveridge&apos;s clear conCe.ts but has developed into a leviathan almost with a life 0 own.    The proposals in this document seek to achieve a greater coherence and comprehensibility in the benefits provided by the State and to give the State and PrlVat^ck provision their proper relationship.   They will rein a the rising social security budget and very greatly reduc the future burden of expenditure.

13.2 In summary the main proposals put forward are follows.

a proper

Pensions will be based on a twin pillars. eXtra

partnership between basic State provision and e ^

 income from pensions earned by people through ^

jobs.   The State earnings-related scheme wi

-j +- wii

ended (although all rights earned under n- ^ honoured).    Instead everybody will build up   ^ ^e pension savings through their job.   People      ^ or free to have a personal pension plan of their&apos; ^ to join the scheme their employers use.        ^ be involvement in these private arrangements kept to the minimum.

Family support will be strengthened by the ra introduction of a new family credit to grve ^jj help to low income families with cnildre^h will be paid in addition to child benefit whlC    haSis aS continue as a universal benefit on the s ^ ^$ hUt now.    The family credit will be assessed and

ffeet ^

paid through the wage packet as an or national insurance.


The supplementary benefit scheme.    It will be largely replaced by a new income support scheme.   This will Provide an income as of right without detailed investigations into individual need.   A smaller social aid scheme will be introduced to give flexible, discretionary help for those with special difficulties.

The housing benefit scheme will be greatly

simplified.    Its income test will be aligned with

that for supplementary benefit and help with housing

costs will be on the same basis for those on

supplementary benefit as for others.   Help with

housing costs will no longer meet the full cost of rates.

Xpung_people will need to look less and less to social security for income support.   As the new training scheme is brought in fewer 16-18 year olds *iU need supplementary benefit. Their entitlement to supplemetary benefit will be further examined after that scheme is fully introduced.   The position of students will be reconsidered in the light of the review of student grants now under way.

^gJSPloyment benefit could be restructured so as more adequately to meet the needs of people who have recently become unemployed.   Higher rates of benefit w uld be paid to people unemployed for less than six months to enable them to manage without recourse to the income support scheme.   The income support scheme w uld provide for those unemployed for more than six months.

i


The two lump sum grants, for death and maternity&apos; which have long out-lived their purpose and are ^ disproportionately expensive to administer will replaced.   But extra help will be given to those really need it.

Benefits for widowhood will be restructured so as reduce duplication between   the State and pnv&apos; sectors and direct resources more effectively those in greater need.   Widow&apos;s allowance wl ^Q replaced by a lump sum payment and changes wi made to the age limits for entitlement to widow pension.

d The

The financing of the system will be reforme contributory principle will be retained but contributions are being restructured to remov undesirable disincentive effects of the c system.

f the review

13.3     These proposals are the culmination or ^ which the Government have undertaken over the p    ^ jt months, the most fundamental since the Second Wo has been based on the work of four review teams - ^ inquiry into provision for retirement, the reVie^ementary benefits for children and young people, the supP ^ benefit review and the housing benefit review. with involved a unique exercise in public consultatl  tel-S/ the three of the four review teams being led by Ml^t Dy fourth, the independent review of housing bene     &apos; vaiuable Mr Jeremy Rowe.
