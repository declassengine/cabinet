ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1985

INTRODUCTION

1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry. The Government will draw on this information when considering proposals by the European Commission for agricultural support in 1985/86 and when taking decisions on national support arrangements. In most cases the forecasts for 1984 were made in November 1984.

PART I STATE OF THE INDUSTRY

2. Growing conditions in 1984 were particularly favourable for arable crops. However, livestock farmers suffered from a shortage of grass for grazing and conservation as a result of a cool dry spring and hot dry summer, particularly in the western half of the country. Milk producers were also affected by the introduction of milk quotas. Mild moist autumn weather helped to bulk-up root crops without seriously hampering sowings of winter cereals and oilseed rape. Gross output at constant prices, which measures in volume terms the output from agriculture, rose significantly, reflecting largely the increased output of most farm crops particularly cereals, oilseed rape and sugar beet.

3. The average prices paid for the industry&apos;s material inputs increased by around 3% while those obtained for its outputs rose by 1%. Farming income, which measures the return to farmers and their spouses and return on own capital invested, rose at current prices by 22% following a fall of 16% in 1983. Farm business income, a wider definition, which is the sum of farming income, the returns to non-principal partners and directors and return on all capital invested, rose by a comparable amount (20%), again following a fall in 1983. The increase in the aggregate income of the industry reflects the good growing conditions and thcresulting high output of arable crops especially cereals.

4. The total area of cereals planted increased and production is estimated at 26.5 million tonnes, over 5 million tonnes higher than the previous year. The acreage sown to oilseed rape increased by 21% to 269,000 hectares and production of a record 923,000 tonnes is expected. The 1984 sugar beet crop is expected to produce 1.25 million tonnes of sugar, an increase of 18% over the previous year. Potato plantings rose by 2% and yields increased. The output of field vegetables was generally higher.

5. Overall, the national cattle breeding herd decreased by 11% during the year, reflecting a 2% drop in the dairy herd and little change in numbers of beef cattle. Milk production is expected to fall by more than 6%. The total number of sheep rose by just under 3% and production of sheepmeat in 1984 is forecast to increase by around 3+% . The number of breeding pigs has continued to decline and pigmeat production in 1984 is forecast to fall by nearly 6%. Egg production in 1984 was marginally lower but yields continued to increase. Poultrymeat production is expected to rise by about 34-%.


PART II GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS

Farm structure (Table 4)

6. In 1984 there were some 239,000 farm holdings in the United Kingdom. This was a reduction of 2% on the number in 1979, the decline being concentrated among the smaller full-time businesses. It is estimated that some 90% of total output came from businesses capable of providing work for at least one full-time man and that, these represent just under half the total number of holdings. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-days or more, whilst only about 13% of the total number of holdings, accounted for about half the total output. In Northern Ireland and Wales, the output from small-scale farms is proportionately more significant than in other parts of the United Kingdom.

7. The average area (including rough grazing) of full-time businesses of 250 standard man-days or more is now 122 hectares compared with about 113 hectares in 1979. As the number of holdings declines and increasing specialisation continues so the average sizes of enterprises tend to increase. There has been a reduction in the last five years of about 11% in the number of holdings growing cereals whilst the average size of cereals enterprises has risen by about 17%. Over the same period the numbers of holdings producing potatoes and sugar beet have declined by 18% and 15% respectively. But there were more than 11,000 oilseed rape enterprises in 1984 compared with about 3,500 in 1979. The average pig breeding herd has increased from 31 to 46 sows over this period whilst the numbers of breeding herds and fattening pig enterprises have both fallen by about a third.

8. In Great Britain 69% of holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1984 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of agricultural land which is farmed by its owner has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 60% in 1984. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.

Output (Tables 22 and 24)

9. Gross output is forecast to rise by  751 million (6%) to  12,349 million in 1984 compared with a rise of  413 million (4%) between 1982 and 1983. The overall volume of output (as measured by the index of gross output at constant 1980 prices) is expected to rise to 112 in 1984 compared with a level of 105 in 1983. This rise is a result of an increase in sales of farm crops, particularly cereals and oilseed rape; the volume of output of livestock products (especially milk), however, is expected to decrease slightly. Overall, the price of outputs is forecast to rise by about 1% between 1983 and 1984, with increases of 19% for potatoes, 17% for fat pigs and 14% for eggs being partly offset by decreases of 6% for sugar beet, 7% for cereals and 11% for oilseed rape. Because of the remarkable increase in the volume of cereals produced, the total value of cereal sales off farms is forecast to increase by 19%, despite the 7% reduction in price. Stocks of cereals remaining on farms at the end of 1984 were 2 million tonnes higher than at the end of 1983. These additional stocks are conventionally

2


^Red at the cost of production in 1984; the full value of subsequent sales from them will not be reflected until 1985. Potato stocks are expected to recover to the 1982 level following a decrease in 1983. Overall, the value of sales off farms at current prices for all farm crops is expected to increase by 19%, sales of horticulture and livestock are expected to rise by 8% and 6% respectively while the value of livestock products is expected to fall by 5%.

Input (Table 22)

10. Gross input for 1984 is expected to rise by  194 million (3%) compared with an increase of  519 million (9%) between 1982 and 1983. The volume of purchased inputs is forecast to decrease slightly with reductions in feedingstuffs, seeds and machinery usage being offset by an increase in the use of fertilisers. Expenditure on fertilisers, machinery and farm maintenance is expected to increase by 13%, 4% and 6% respectively. The average price of bought-in goods and services increased by about 3% with fertilisers, machinery repairs and farm maintenance increasing by 6%, 8% and 6% respectively.

Gross and net product (Tables 22 and 23)

11. Gross product, which is gross output less gross input, is forecast to be  5,823 million in 1984, an increase of 11% on the 1983 figure. After allowing for depreciation on fixed assets, net product (the measure of the net value added by the agricultural industry to all goods and services purchased from outside the sector) is forecast to increase by  526 million (13%) compared with a decrease of  149 million (4%) between 1982 and 1983.

Aggregate income (Tables 22 and 23)

12. The net product of agriculture represents the sum of various types of income. From the net product, the agricultural industry has to pay its labour force, meet the interest on outstanding debt and provide for expenditure on net rent, while also providing the return to farmers for their own labour, management and capital invested.

13. Farming Income of farmers and their spouses is defined as the balance of net product after meeting labour costs, interest charges and net rent. In 1984, the labour bill for hired and family workers is expected to increase by  89 million (5%); and net rent by  14 million (11%). Interest payments are expected to rise by  99 million (20%). The resulting Farming Income is forecast to increase by  324 million (22%) to  1,826 million in 1984, compared to the decrease of  299 million (17%) experienced between 1982 and 1983, though as explained in paragraph 16 below, results differ markedly between sectors. The Farming Income series in money and real terms for recent years are shown in column (b) of Tables 23A and 23B. It should be noted that Farming Income is the difference between the two large aggregates of output and expenditure. A small percentage change to either can generate a large change in the income measure. Additionally, the calendar year income measures cannot be simply related to that particular year&apos;s harvest, since the valuation of output includes substantial sales of cereals and potatoes carried


over from the previous year&apos;s crop. It is also affected by changes in the quantity of harvested crops in store on farms at the end of each year; for example, cereal stocks increased by 22% in 1984 and 18% in 1983.

14. There are several other measures of the industry&apos;s income which are more broadly based and rather less volatile than net Farming Income. For example, Farm Business Income (column (c) of Table 23A) includes, in addition to the income of farmers and their spouses, the returns to non-principal farmers and directors and the returns on all capital invested (own or borrowed). In 1984 Farm Business Income rose by 20% having fallen by 11% in 1983.

15. Column (d) in Table 23A presents a measure of the cash flow of farmers and their spouses. This index shows the revenue accruing to farmers and spouses (including capital grants) less cash outlays, including spending on material inputs and services and on capital items. As such, it may be close to how many farmers perceive the financial situation of the industry. Between 1983 and 1984, the cash flow is estimated to have risen by 22%, having fallen by 16% between 1982 and 1983.

Income developments by farm type (Tables 26 and 27)

16. Information about income per farm according to the type and size of the holding, based on farm accounts from samples of full-time farms, differs in coverage and accounting concepts and practices from the aggregate calculation and thus is not directly comparable with it. The accounts for 1983/84 (the year ending on average in February 1984) show increases in income on cropping farms but declines on livestock farms, particularly dairy and pig and poultry farms. Table 27 indicates the average levels of incomes earned by farm businesses of various types and sizes in the different countries of the United Kingdom. Forecasts of farm income in 1984/85 suggest increases on cereal, pig and poultry farms and possible small increases on hill and upland cattle and sheep farms but reductions on other types.

17. After three years of recovery to 1982/83, incomes on most dairy farms fell sharply in 1983/84 and are expected to show a further decline in 1984/85, mainly because of the effects on milk returns of the dry summer and of dairy quotas. On hill and upland (less favoured area) cattle and sheep farms, there was in general a fall in income in 1983/84 following a more pronounced drop in the previous year. In 1984/85 incomes on these farms are expected to show some recovery, except in Scotland where a further fall in forecast. Except in Northern Ireland, incomes on lowland livestock farms generally declined in both 1982/83 and 1983/84. During 1984/85 incomes on these farms throughout the United Kingdom are expected to fall. Incomes on pig and poultry farms also fell substantially in both 1982/83 and 1983/84. But they are forecast to show a large increase in 1984/85 as a result of higher output prices and virtually stable production costs overall.

18. Incomes on specialist cereal farms in England showed a small increase in 1983/84 but a much larger rise is forecast for 1984/85, mainly resulting from the value of additional wheat production. On other cropping farms incomes also rose in 1983/84 but are expected to fall somewhat in 1984/85 since the value


^^xtra cereal and oilseed rape production will not offset the effect of lower potato prices.

19. The overall picture shown by the farm accounts is that incomes are expected to fall in money and real terms on dairy, lowland livestock and cropping farms other than those specialising in cereals, but to rise on specialist cereal, pig and poultry and, to a lesser extent, hill and upland livestock farms. In real terms incomes on dairy and most livestock farms are substantially below the levels of the late 1970s, while on cropping farms they have in general improved over the same period.

Productivity (Tables 5 and 24)

20. The index of gross agricultural product at constant prices per whole-time man equivalent reflects changes in, for example, plant and animal breeding, investment in the organisation of farming, as well as changes in the number of persons engaged and short-term movements in output caused by factors such as weather. During the ten years to 1983 the index, although fluctuating from year to year, increased on average by about 4% annually. In 1983 it fell by 4% but is forecast to recover exceptionally in 1984 and to show an increase of 15%. This arises from an increase of 13% in gross agricultural product at constant prices and a further small decline in the total agricultural labour force. The number of regular whole-time workers fell by 3.5% between 1983 and 1984, similar to the average annual reduction of about 4% in the ten years to 1983.

21. An alternative measure of productivity could be obtained by comparing changes in the level of output with changes in the total relevant inputs employed; these inputs include labour, usage of capital items and material inputs. Preliminary calculations suggest a rise of around 2% per annum over the last decade. Because of the rise in output during 1984 a higher than average increase in this measure would be expected.

Gross capital formation (Table 20)

22. It is estimated that the value of new investment in fixed assets will rise by 2% in 1984, to  1,380 million. Expenditure on buildings and works is forecast to be  700 million, a rise of 9% compared with the 1983 level, while that on plant, machinery and vehicles is forecast to fall by 5% to  680 million. In volume terms new investment in buildings and works is forecast to increase by about 8% whereas that in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to fall by 8%. In aggregate, the volume of total gross fixed capital formation is forecast to be almost the same as in 1983.

23. The value of the physical increase in on-farm output stocks rose significantly in 1984 following the growth in output of all major farm crops. In contrast, the value of investment in breeding livestock and work-in-progress fell in 1984 as a result of the reduction in the cattle population, largely arising from the introduction of milk quotas.

Bank borrowings

24. Bank advances to agriculture in 1984 are forecast to average some  5,385 million, about 14% more than the average for 1983. The rate of increase in bank borrowing is however less than that between 1982 and 1983.


The relationship between the liabilities and assets of the industry rem K generally sound. Information from the balance sheets of a sample of full-time farm businesses in England and Wales in the Farm Management Survey suggests that external liabilities are equivalent to about 25% of the total business assets of tenanted farms, about 10% of the assets of owner-occupied farms and about 14% of the assets of mixed tenure farms.

Agricultural land prices (Table 25)

25. The sale price of agricultural land with vacant possession in England rose slowly since 1979 following the much more rapid rises of the late 1970s; in 1983 the comprehensive Inland Revenue series indicated an average price per hectare of  3,717. In contrast, in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland the average sale price of land peaked in 1979 and then fell back, starting to rise again in Wales in 1982, but not in Scotland and Northern Ireland until 1983. The rise in 1983 was substantial in Wales and Scotland, average prices reaching  2,845 and  2,350 per hectare respectively. The rise in Northern Ireland was more modest, where prices reached  2,866 per hectare. The price of tenanted agricultural land has been fairly steady in England since 1979, the Inland Revenue series indicating an average price of  2,420 per hectare in 1983. In Wales and Scotland prices peaked in 1980 and have since fallen back sharply in Wales to  688 per hectare in 1983 and, in a fluctuating manner, to  987 per hectare in Scotland. Indications are that land prices generally have declined during 1984.

Farm rents (Table 25)

26. From provisional results of the annual rent enquiry in England and Wales and from continuing field surveys in Scotland it appears that average farm rents in Great Britain will increase by 10% in 1984 over the 1983 level. The change between 1982 and 1983 showed an increase of 12%.

Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 21)

27. The average weekly earnings of whole-time hired men in the United Kingdom were  116.57 for 46.5 hours in 1983 compared with  105.44 for 46.1 hours in 1982. Average weekly earnings in 1984 are forecast to be about  123.10 for 46.0 hours. Following the increases in weekly wage rates that came into effect in September and October 1983 (paragraph 26 of the 1984 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 9137)), statutory minimum weekly wage rates were increased by 4.5% for adult regular whole-time hired workers in England and Wales from 3 June 1984, by 5% for general workers in Scotland from 3 September 1984 and by 4.5% for agriculture workers in Northern Ireland from 6 August 1984.

Public expenditure (Table 28)

28. Expenditure in the United Kingdom on market regulation under the Common Agricultural Policy is estimated to be about  1,424 million in 1984/85 compared with some  1,374 million in 1983/84. This expenditure includes the butter and school milk subsidies, the beef and sheepmeat variable premium schemes, the premium schemes for the non-marketing of milk and for the conversion of dairy herds, the suckler cow premium scheme, the annual


^Rmium on ewes, export refunds and the cost of purchasing commodities into intervention less proceeds from sales. It also includes a variety of other grants and subsidies. Some of this expenditure benefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. Receipts from the milk co-responsibility and supplementary levies, export charges equivalent to the variable premium on sheep-meat (known as &quot;clawback&quot;), charges on beef exported and sold into intervention and levies on intra-community trade have been netted off against this expenditure. The additional expenditure in 1984/85 is mainly due to increased purchases into intervention of beef and cereals, to increased expenditure on export refunds and to lower sales of cereals from intervention. These increases are partly offset by reduced net expenditure on butter and skimmed milk powder intervention and reduced payments on the consumer butter subsidy, the sheepmeat variable premium and the oilseed crushing subsidy.

29. Expenditure in the United Kingdom on price guarantees for wool and potatoes, capital grants and support for agriculture in special areas (excluding brucellosis) is estimated to be  356 million in 1984/85 compared with  354 million in 1983/84.

PART III   COMMODITY TRENDS Cereals (Table 3, 6, 8 and 29)

30. In 1984 cereals were grown on 4.05 million hectares, a net increase of 92,000 hectares over 1983. An increase of 270,000 hectares in the area sown to wheat more than offset a fall of some 178,000 hectares in the area of barley and other cereals. There was a further drop in plantings of breadmaking wheats. Yields of all cereals were at record levels, and average quality was higher than in 1983. Production of all cereals reached the record level of 26.5 million tonnes, over 4.5 million tonnes higher than the previous record harvest in 1982 and some 5 million tonnes more than was harvested in 1983.

31. Price increases from January onwards were not as marked as in the first half of 1983. Prices of breadmaking wheat and oats were firm, reflecting lower production from the 1983 harvest, but prices of feed wheat and feed barley showed only modest gains for most of the period up to the 1984 harvest. Some restraint on prices was exerted by the introduction of a 120 to 140 days delay in payment for grain delivered into intervention. There were only limited domestic market sales of wheat and barley out of intervention, totalling about 60,000 tonnes. The record harvest and changes in support arrangements had a marked effect on new crop prices, causing them to fall to well below support levels in the months immediately following the harvest. There were heavy offers of feed wheat and barley into intervention, reaching nearly 3 million tonnes by the end of November. Offers of bread wheat in the August-October intervention period totalled some 343,000 tonnes which was abated to 21,000 tonnes under the special monthly quota arrangements introduced by the Commission to ensure that the total quantity bought into intervention in the Community did not exceed 3 million tonnes. In spite of record intervention purchases and higher export levels than those of last season, the domestic market was abundantly supplied with grain. Feed wheat and feed barley have been traded at about the same price.


Oilseed rape (Tables 3, 6, 9 and 29)

32. The area sown with oilseed rape in 1984 increased by 21% to 269,000 hectares. As with most other arable crops, average yields were higher than normal at 3.43 tonnes per hectare, mainly due to favourable weather conditions. Production is expected to be a record at 923,000 tonnes. There has been a further increase in the area sown for the 1985 crop and, even with normal yields, some further increase in production can be expected. Market prices in 1984 were steady and farmers&apos; returns are likely to have been just above the intervention price levels.

Potatoes (Tables 3, 6, 10 and 29)

33. Plantings in 1984 were some 9,000 hectares more than the United Kingdom target area of 190,000. The crop benefited from almost ideal planting conditions and, although growth was hindered by the very dry weather of June and July, yield potential was generally restored by the widespread rain in August. Consequently, with yields close to record 1982 levels and plantings in excess of target, there was a markedly higher level of production than last year, accompanied by significantly lower prices. The Potato Marketing Board was again authorised to offer contracts pre-season to producers in Great Britain for a proportion of their crop with the aim of ensuring stability in the market throughout the season; some 450,000 tonnes of potatoes were placed under contract in this way. Support buying in Great Britain began in October and in Northern Ireland in November when it became evident that a surplus was depressing the market.

34. A review of support arrangements has been completed and a revised basis has been agreed for cost sharing between the Government and the Potato Marketing Board in the event of support buying. The aim of these measures is to put the Board on a sound financial footing for the future and reduce the cost to public funds of potato market support in the longer term. It is intended that the revised arrangements will be implemented for the 1985 crop. A revised agreement with the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union has also been reached in respect of Northern Ireland potato market support arrangements from the 1984 crop.

Sugar beet (Tables 3, 6, 11 and 29)

35. The tonnage of sugar beet which farmers contracted to grow in 1984 represented an area of about 200,000 hectares, slightly less than in 1983. The harvested area will probably be around 196,000 hectares, the same as last year. Weather during the growing season was favourable with sowing and establishment of the crop taking place in good conditions. Harvesting in the early part of the campaign has been in generally favourable conditions and, if these continue, the crop may yield 1.25 million tonnes of white sugar. This would be the second highest on record, only bettered by the 1982 crop which produced 1.4 million tonnes. It would mean that the maximum quota of 1.144 million tonnes set for the United Kingdom under the Community sugar regime would be exceeded. The excess has to be exported without export refunds or carried forward to the next quota year.


^Rticulture (Tables 3, 6, 12 and 29)

36. It is not practicable to deal individually with the whole range of horticultural crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom. These paragraphs concentrate on certain crops in significant production here including those subject to Community internal market arrangements (apples, pears, cauliflowers and tomatoes).

37. The area devoted to horticulture in 1984 was about 218,000 hectares compared with 224,000 hectares in 1983, a decrease of nearly 3%.

38. Production of dessert apples in 1984 was about average, though yields of Cox were slightly down. Production of culinary apples was substantially above the 1983 level but production of pears was below the high level of the previous year. Production of most soft fruit crops was at about the same level as 1983 but particularly hot weather during the summer shortened the strawberry season, affected soft fruit quality and caused marketing problems. Production of blackcurrants returned to a more normal level after the high yielding crop of 1983.

39. Production of field vegetables in 1984 has generally been above that of 1983 and supplies should be ample. The exceptionally dry and hot summer had less effect on crops in the east (where there is a greater proportion of irrigated land) than in the west. Good growing conditions resulted in an oversupply of cauliflowers during some periods of the season. Growers of glasshouse salad crops, while achieving about the same production levels as in 1983, had to face large increases in heating costs and continuing competition from imports.

40. Prices of apples at the beginning of 1984 were substantially higher than for the corresponding period of 1983. The new season&apos;s crop started at prices similar to those of 1983 but as the season progressed prices fell below 1983 levels. Prices of pears remained close to 1983 levels with the new season&apos;s crop initially attracting a slight premium. Withdrawals of 1984 season apples are expected to be moderate, as for 1983, and those of pears should be lighter. Until April cauliflower prices were generally higher than during the same period in 1983. By the end of June, however, supplies were plentiful and this situation continued to the end of October resulting in lower prices and large quantities being withdrawn. After a hesitant start 1984 tomato prices were generally as high or higher than those of the previous year, apart from short spells in mid-summer and autumn, and withdrawals were low. Supplies from the Netherlands continued to dominate the market in cut flowers and prices were around the 1983 levels.

Hops (Tables 3, 6, 13 and 29)

41. The area under hops decreased by about 480 hectares. Production was considerably reduced but, because of the high level of stocks held by brewers, will still be more than enough to meet contracts. The crop was of average quality and prices generally increased.


Seeds (Table 14) ^

42. The area approved in 1984 for production of certified herbage and legume seed (excluding field bean and field pea seed) was marginally higher than that for 1983. Yield and quality were good but stocks fell slightly. Production of field bean and pea seed was substantially lower. Supplies were adequate and stocks a little higher.

43. The ending of the system of agreed guide prices for herbage seed growers and the increasing use of participation contracts have made trends unclear. There are indications that some prices to seed growers may be lower than in 1983.

Dried peas and beans

44. The area sown with peas in 1984 was 57,000 hectares, an increase of 21% over last year. Yields in 1984 are estimated at 3.91 tonnes per hectare. This is the first year that comparisons of the level of the United Kingdom pea crop have been possible because peas for stock feeding were separately identified for the first time in the 1983 June Census returns. The area sown with beans in 1984 was 32,800 hectares, a fall of 3% compared with 1983. Yields in 1984 are estimated at 3.88 tonnes per hectare, compared with a final figure of 3.10 tonnes for 1983.

45. Prices for peas and beans have generally been around the minimum producer price level specified in the Community aid scheme for peas and beans.

Beef and milk (Tables 3, 6, 15, 16, 17 and 29)

46. The June Census showed a decline of U% in the total United Kingdom cattle breeding herd compared with the previous year. The size of the United Kingdom beef breeding herd was little changed while the dairy herd, which accounts for about 70% of all breeding cows, declined by 2%. This reflects in part the response of dairy producers to the introduction of milk quotas from 2 April 1984. Regionally there was an increase of 2% in Northern Ireland, but in Scotland the growth observed last year has been followed by a decline of 3% and in Wales the decline is about 1%. The size of the national dairy herd is expected to decline further in 1985.

47. Home-fed production of beef in 1984 is expected to be about 8% higher than in 1983; some of the increase reflects the heavier dairy cow culling evident since the introduction of milk quotas. Exports are forecast to increase by about 51% and imports to fall by about 9% giving total new supplies for home consumption of 1.1 million tonnes, some 5% above 1983 levels with production representing 101% of the total new supply. Average market prices for certified cattle were around lOOp/live kg for the first few months of the year rising to 104p/live kg at the beginning of June and then declining seasonally to under 94p/live kg during September and October. Variable premium has been paid at the maximum rate for most of the year except for three weeks at the end of May and beginning of June and again from mid-October. Average total returns to producers from the sale of clean cattle were at a similar level to 1983. Total


^rlervention purchases during the year were around 50,000 tonnes, representing about 4+% of forecast total new supplies. Most of these purchases occurred during the period of &quot;full carcase&quot; intervention (with hindquarters or fore-quarters as alternative options) from 20 August to 25 November 1984. About 70% of intervention purchases took place in Northern Ireland.

48. The average yield of milk per cow in 1984 is expected to be more than 2+% lower than in 1983. Drought conditions reduced yields during 1984. Following the introduction of quotas from April, some producers have sought to reduce output by management changes which reduce yields. As a result of this, total milk production in 1984 as a whole is forecast to be more than 6% lower than in 1983. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption in 1984 is expected to be only very slightly less than in 1983. With reduced supplies of milk available it is estimated that there will be a fall of more than 10% in the volume of milk available for manufacturing. Milk used for cheese production is forecast to decrease by about 2% and for butter production by about 16%.

49. Producer returns for milk are determined by the Milk Marketing Boards on the basis of their returns from the liquid and manufacturing milk markets. The average net return to producers in the United Kingdom for all milk for the 1984/85 year is forecast to be between 14.5 ppl and 14.7 ppl. Returns to producers in England and Wales are expected to be around this level whereas in Scotland they are expected to be slightly higher at about 15.0 ppl and in Northern Ireland slightly lower at 13.8 ppl.

50. Statutory price controls on liquid milk in England, Wales and Northern Ireland ended on 31 December 1984. (Controls in Scotland had been ended previously.)

Sheep and wool (Tables 3, 15, 19 and 29)

51. The breeding flock expanded by just under 2+% between June 1983 and June 1984, a slightly lower rate than during the previous year.

52. Home-fed production of sheepmeat is forecast to be around 3+% higher in 1984 following another good lambing season. Total supplies to the home market are forecast to fall in 1984 by about 2i% with a reduction in imports of 12% but with exports at a similar level to the previous year. Market prices in Great Britain have been on average about 10% above those of 1983. In Northern Ireland prices have been marginally lower than in the previous year. Sheep variable premium was paid in Great Britain in every week of 1984. Annual premium payments relating to the 1983/84 marketing year amounted to  6.81 per ewe in Great Britain and  14.58 per ewe in Northern Ireland where variable premium is not payable. Average prices for store lambs continued to rise, particularly in England. Draft ewe prices rose significantly in Northern Ireland and England but fell back slightly in Scotland and Wales.

53. Wool production in 1984 is forecast to be about 3% lower than the record clip of 1983 but should still be above all other previous years&apos; clips. The guaranteed price was increased by 5p/kg. The average market price for the 1984 clip is forecast to be above the guaranteed price and as a consequence previous Exchequer advances are now being repaid.


Pigs (Tables 3, 15 and 29)  

54. Pigmeat production in 1984 is expected to be nearly 6% below the 1983 level. As a result of the fall in the number of home-produced pigs, better pig prices and lower feedstuffs costs, profitability has improved. This is expected to promote an increase in the breeding herd in 1985. Overall, prices in 1984 averaged 17% above 1983 levels.

Poultry meat (Tables 3, 15 and 29)

55. Output in 1984 is expected to be some 31% above the level of the previous year. This reflects a 4-P/o increase in broiler meat production and an increase of nearly 1% for turkeymeat. A slight fall is forecast for broiler meat production for 1985, while turkeymeat production is expected to increase by 1%. Average wholesale prices of chickens and turkeys for the year are expected to show a slight increase over 1983 levels.

Eggs (Tables 3, 6, 18 and 29)

56. Although layer chick placings in 1984 were higher than in the previous year the total average laying flock over the year as a whole is forecast to have been some 4% less than 1983 and a further small reduction is expected in 1985. The trend of increased egg yields has continued but supplies of eggs for consumption are expected to be about 1% lower than in 1983. Average prices in 1984 are expected to be above the levels of the two previous years.


APPENDIX

STATISTICAL TABLES

The tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper. Some of the figures in this appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods, although there has been no change in the basis of the tables. The forecasts for 1984 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year, as seen at November 1984.

All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.

Figures for imports and exports to the Nine relate throughout to the other countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).

Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables. Figures for exports include re-exports.

In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.

BLE 3 (continued)

(a) The data in this table vary between the different countries as follows: 

England and Wales; For all years the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings including minor holdings (previously called statistically insignificant holdings).

Scotland: From 1973 the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings with 40 smd or more. (A standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours&apos; productive work by an adult worker under average conditions.) Prior to June 1977 following the 1976 minor holdings census 1,700 holdings were transferred from the main to the minor category.

Northern Ireland: From 1973 to 1980 the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings with (i) 40 smd or more, or (ii) 4 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more full-time workers, excluding the owner. The figures for 1981 onwards relate to all known holdings with: (i) one European Size Unit (ESU) or more, or (ii) 6 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more full-time workers, excluding the owner. (A European Size Unit equals 1,000 European Units of Account of standard gross margin at average 1972-74 values.) The change between 1980 and 1981 resulted in the net deletion of 7,000 holdings but their exclusion has had an insignificant effect on the cropping and stocking figures.

(b) Cereals for threshing, excluding maize.

(c) Collected separately in Scotland from 1982 and in Northern Ireland from 1984.

(d) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.

(e) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.

if)    Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by the glasshouse area.

(g) Includes area of other crops and hare fallow not shown in the table.

(h) Before 1975 collected as:

In England and Wales - &quot;clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses&quot;;

In Scotland - &quot;grass under 7 years old&quot;;

In Northern Ireland - &quot;grass 1st, 2nd and 3rd year&quot;.

(0   Before 1975 collected as:

In England and Wales - &quot;permanent grass&quot;;

In Scotland - &quot;grass 7 years old and over&quot;;

In Northern Ireland - &quot;grass 4th year or older&quot;.

(/) In June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings, etc., the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land within agricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land. The Northern Ireland definition is unchanged.

(k)   Small adjustments made retrospectively following the 1983 census of minor holdings in England.

(a) The figures in this Table do not include the minor holdings (previously called statistically insignificant holdings) which for England and Wales have been included in Tables 3 and 5 (see footnote (a) to Table 3). The figures for 1979 have been adjusted to lake account of the reappraisal of minor holdings in England and Wales which resulted in a further 11,000 holdings being removed from the 1980 June Census. The removal of some 7,000 such holdings from the Census in Northern Ireland between June 1980 and June 1981 (see note (a) to Table 3) has no significant effect on this Table. The Northern Ireland figures in the first two sections of the Table include only holdings with 50 smd or more which were only slightly affected by the change, as were the quantities of crops and stock in the other sections of the Table. The decline in the total number of holdings is reflected in the smallest size group and has marginally increased the average size of some enterprises. Caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with those quoted in recent Annual Review White Papers and in particular with figures in Annual Review White Papers published prior to the 1978 Review when results were based on imperial measurements and old smd values.

(b) The average size of holdings based on total area was:

1979 71.6 hectares of which 67.8% was under crops and grass. 1984  72.6 hectares of which 68.6% was under crops and grass.

(c) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass which are excluded from the first section of the Table.

(rf)   With the introduction of revised smd values for the 1978 Annual Review the figures shown in this Table arc comparable only

with those in the Annual Review White Papers for 1978 onwards (but see note (a) above), (r)   In 1979 figures related to England and Wales only.

if)    Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1979 relate to the 1978 December Census.

(g)   Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to holdings engaged in fattening only purchased wcaners.

[It)   Figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland include small numbers of other table fowls.

(a) The figures arc based on returns in the Agricultural Census but include some estimates for figures not directly obtainable from the Scottish Census results. Wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors engaged in farm work were returned separately in 1977. Figures for earlier years exclude this category and this is thought to explain the decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers from 1977 onwards.

Figures include estimates for all minor holdings (previously called statistically insignificant holdings) in England and Wales not surveyed in the respective June Censuses (see footnote (a) to Table 3).

(b) Small adjustments made retrospectively following the 1983 census of minor holdings in England.

(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland. Sec footnote (d).

(d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item in Northern Ireland, but were included with part-lime workers.

(e) Figures relate to Great Britain only.

((j I Since this table relates to output, i.e. sales, rather than to total production, the quantities valued are not the same as those shown for home production in the supply tables (Tables 7-19). Output is net of VAT collected on the sale of inedible products, which is repaid to IIM Customs and Excise. Figures for total output include subsidies but exclude compensation

gaymcnts. cc footnote (c) Table 18.

(c)   This comprises the cost of that part of investment in buildings and works which is physically undertaken by the farmer or

farm labour and the value of the physical increase in breeding livestock (breeding livestock capital formation). Id)   The figure for 1983 and the forecast for 1984 include advance payments deferred until 1984 and 1985.

(e) Work-in-progress is livestock other than breeding livestock; output stocks comprise cereals, potatoes and fruit; input stocks comprise fertilisers and purchased feed.

(f) Sales included in output but subsequently repurchased and so reappearing as input.

(g) Expenditure is netted of VAT reclaimed in the normal way, but each heading includes VAT paid without recovery by, for example, unregistered producers.

(h) Landlords&apos; expenses arc included within farm maintenance, miscellaneous expenditure and depreciation on buildings and works. Net rent is the rent paid on tenanted land less these landlords&apos; expenses and the benefit value of dwellings on that land.

(i) Including veterinary expenses, pesticides, electricity and rates.

(j)   Including employers&apos; national insurance contributions. The estimate in respect of family workers (except spouses) and

partners is calculated on the basis of the earnings of hired labour. (k)   On commercial debt but excluding loans for land purchases.

(0 The return to farmers and spouses for their labour, management skills and own capital invested after providing for depreciation.

All countries: 1984 figures are provisional.

(6) The Inland Revenue series excludes sales of less than 5 hectares in England, Wales and Scotland and of less than 2 hectares in Northern Ireland as well as land sold for development and other non-agricultural purposes. In addition, the scries shown for Scotland refer to equipped farms only and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation and inter-family sales. There is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed and the dale on which it is included in the scries. The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months in England and Wales and about 3 months in Northern Ireland. The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included in the scries for these countries in the years ending in the following September and March respectively. In the case of Scotland, the problem is overcome by further analysis of information by date of sale. The data for Scotland and Northern Ireland are subject to retrospective revision.

(c) The indices of average rents for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotland on continuing field surveys. In Northern Ireland very little land is rented except under the conacre system.

Notes

(a) The data in Tables 26 and 27 arc derived from figures collected in Farm Management Surveys by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. They relate to full-time farms and to averages weighted by the census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England 1983/84&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Farm Incomes in Scotland 1983/84&quot;, for Wales in &quot;Farm Accounts in Wales 1983/84&quot; and for Northern Ireland in a pjblication by the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The index numbers series arc provisional for the period 1977/78 to 1981/82.

(b) A discontinuity in these series occurs in 1982/83. In earlier years farms arc allocated to farm types according to the distribution between the various enterprises of their standard gross margin based on 1972-74 average values. In later years standard gross margins arc based on updated values (average 1978-80) and this has led to some movement of mi ms between types and size groups. The two series are linked at 1982/83 but results for earlier years arc not directly comparable with those for 1983/84 and 1984/85.

(c) Net income is the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and the return on tenant-type capital in crops, livestock, machinery, etc., but excluding land and buildings. It is calculated before deduction of interest on any farming loans. All farms are treated as rented and an imputed rental value for owner-occupied land is charged as an expense in the accounts. (In Northern Ireland, as rents cannot be imputed with reference to tenanted farms, rental charges for owned land and buildings are assessed in relation to estimated sale value.),Stocks of crops and livestock on farms at the beginning and end of the accounting year arc valued at current market prices and net income includes stock appreciation except that arising on breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. The accounts relate mainly to calendar years or years ending 5 April and the average year-ending date is about mid-February.

(d) The forecast indices shown for 1984/85 are estimates by the Agriculture Departments based on past survey results and on data from the agriculture census, market reports and aggregate farm income calculations. The indices should be regarded only as broad indications of possible income developments assuming normal weather conditions between November and the close of the average accounting year in February.

IV)   Indices in real terms are those at current prices deflated by the Retail Price Index.

if) &quot;LFA cattle and sheep&quot; includes all Hill and Upland (LFA) farm types. &quot;lowland cattle and sheep&quot; includes &quot;cropping cattle and sheep&quot;.

(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by the expenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease or on research, advice and education). It also excludes most expenditure on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund. It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. The figures for years up to and including 1983/84 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1984/85 arc the latest estimates of expenditure.

(6) The figures arc made up of several elements and include refunds on infra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beef and sheep variable premium schemes (net of clawhack for sheepmeal and charges on beef exported and sold into intervention), aid for private storage and animal feed, certain other marketing and production subsidies and the cost of purchasing commodities into intervention less proceeds from sales. The figures also take account of other receipts treated as negative expenditure, namely monetary compensatory amounts levied on intra-Community trade and the co-responsibility and supplementary levies on milk producers. The figures include the EC butter subsidy and the United Kingdom share of the EC school milk subsidy scheme.

(c) Includes eggs, poultrymcat, fruit and vegetables, hops, herbage seeds, dried fodder, peas and beans, fisheries, flax and aid to beekeepers. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significant extent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine, grapemust and hemp).

(d) Price guarantee arrangements for sheep were superseded by the EC shcepmeat regime on 20 October 1980.

(e) Payments in respect of wool and potatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated and partly to the clip or crop in the preceding year or years. The negative figure for wool reflects the stabilisation arrangements with the British Wool Marketing Board whereby advance payments made by the Exchequer arc repayable from later surpluses when auction prices arc above the guaranteed price.

(/)    Includes the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.

Qj) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Scheme, Northern Ireland Agricultural Development Programme and the Agriculture and Horticulture Grant Schemes. The estimated benefit is shown separately in Section IV of the table.

(/))   Includes the Farm and Horticulture Capital Grant Schemes.

(i) Includes grants in respect of investment on loan guarantees, producer organisations, agricultural drainage and milk pasteurisation equipment (for which provision was included in the 1984/85 Supply Estimates) and farm structure loans.

(/) The receipts from the Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund do not relate to expenditure incurred during the financial year but mainly to expenditure incurred in the calendar year preceding the financial year.

(A I Includes grants for forage groups, integrated development programme for Western Isles, producers in the Scottish Islands and crofting improvements. Provision for this expenditure was included in the 1984/85 Supply Estimates.
