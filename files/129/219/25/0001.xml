CABINET

ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS:  NORTHERN IRELAND

MemMA^Un by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland

INTRODUCTION

On 16 February Cabinet authorised talks with the Irish

Government aboutWRble Anglo-Irish Agreement.    A progress report was made to Cabinet^ JL July 1985 when it was agreed to pursue the negotiations on the b^s^then discussed.    Agreement has now been reached with the IrisT Government on the mam outstending Provisional arrangements are being made for signature of the Agreement within the next three weeks.

2.    We entered into the negot^gfcvs on the basis of a judgment that the Prospects for Northern Ireland under a further prolonged period of direct rule were bleak.    In the absence of political move^ Polarisation of the two communing* likely to grow a,id     &lt;1 ^ L&quot; increase.    As the negotiations ha7#r%ressed nationalist hopes have Reused on a positive outcome.    It %^kassessment that    m lu absence of an Agreement,  the s ituatio  *orthern Ireland will deteriorate sharply.

3- The Agreement, as now negotiated, me^tj^sets of objectives. It Provides reassurance for unionists through A recognition    rom the Irish that the constitutional status of NorTrTern Ireland cannot change without majority consent and through a firmer commitment by them to cross-border security.    Secondly, it aims to bring the minority to readier accep ance of the apparatus of Government i  Northern Ireland by giving the  Irish a  formalised (but not executive) rol^n respect of Northern Ireland affairs affecting the nationalist cMj^y.

4- The text of the Agreement&apos;is annexed to this memorandum, together with the draft of a Joint Communique to be  Lssued on s ^WfW% (Annexes A and B).    Though now set out   in legal   form,  the A8reem^\jQ^ft,      th substantially the same as  that discussed by Cabinet on 25 Z ^e inclusion of a provision regarding entry into force.    u vrov^/; for clear condemnation of terrorism in the preamble; binding recogni .on by the Irish Government in Article 1 that any change m the stay ^ Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majorj^


fcthere and that such consent does not at present exist; the establishment Cfc a Ministerial Committee (to be called &quot;The Intergovernmental reference&quot;) where the Irish Government may put forward views and

pr%osals in stated areas and where determined efforts would be made to Resolve any differences, but where they would have no executive or decision-making role (Articles 2-8); and arrangements for closer co-operation between North and South, notably on security matters (Articles 9 and 10).    The reservation of decision-making power to the British Gj^rnment has been made explicit (Article 2(b)).

5.    This hlS^^a controversial issue and Article 8 represents a compromise b^V British and Irish positions.    The Irish have pressed for a firm BrlWfcommitment to establish mixed courts.    We have mad. it clear that w^#^ilUng to consider the possibility in the Intergovernmental Conference, but that we cannot enter into such a commitment and se^ serious political and practical difficulties about the idea.    That is *teJL understood and is the position reflected in the text of Article ails^it now stands.    The only P? c &quot; .n?w &quot;!*d &quot; get clearly established is Irish acceptance that British Mm&quot;Jers will wish to make it clear in Parliament and to the press that, although we are wiUing to study the proposal and do not exclude the P ssl^Uty of mixed courts at some future tima.ve cannot see any easy or early way round the political and otheA iculties involved.    This, together with a few other minor textuMJks,  is under discussion with the Irish Government and we will re gfcrally on the outcome.

6- In the course of the negot iat i^lthe Irish offered to accede in the context of the Agreement to thPJyj^an Convention on he Session of Terrorism.    When it be^jllear that we could not en tr into a commitment to establish mixed courts, the Irish withdrew their decision to accede to the Convention, b fc|now agreed to announce

their intention to do so provided that P*S^_1!\made &quot;V^Ln of covered by the Agreement, notably in relat^T*, the administration of justice.    We are making it clear that their intention to accede must be unconditional.

IMPLEMENTATION

7- We have agreed with the Irish that certain measures Bho,ad be taken ^ rapid implementation of the Agreement.    On our s^P||e includ* * number of minor measures relating to the Ulster Defence Regiment and Royal Ulster Constabulary which are desirable for their&apos;Mlake nfl which we hope will address some minority concerns.    Thes* measures ao

form part of the Agreement and will be announced separ^Jk Tne Irish Government for their part have begun to redeploy task forces at the Garda in the border areas and we shall be pressing them WW ke significant and lasting improvements in their security arrange^TUmon the border. W


SECRETARIAT

V   8.    it has been agreed that the Intergovernmental Conference which will ^^normally meet in Belfast will need to be serviced by a Joint

Secretariat.    The Secretariat will be a particular focus of resentment unionists.    It may be possible to persuade the Irish that the first J|^tting of the Intergovernmental Conference should take place in London ^hdonly the second in Belfast; and that the Secretariat should be located in Belfast after the second meeting and then only with a very small staff.    The precise location and composition of the Secretariat, especially at the outset, is likely to be determined mainly by security considerations.

TIMING U^t.

9-    The Ag Qp|t will not enter  into force until the two Parliaments have approvecKhaAgreement and notifications of acceptance have been exchanged.    A^fcn^knents will be made  for the two Parliaments to debate the Agreement a^^kAi as possible after signature.

LIKELY REACTIONS  IN IRELAND

The indications ^^Irhat  the Social Democratic and Labour Party  LP) will support the Agreement as a modest but useful step.    They may also be prepared to talk to the unionists about arrangements for a evolved Government (so ending their refusal to participate in the 0rthern Ireland political process) but only, it seems clear, if the unionists agree to some form ojf^^wer sharing.

1     Unionist politicians will react very negatively.    There is no early Prospect of them countenancing a power sharing arrangement with the

      But   if their attempts  to undertime the Agreement  fail,  they may See accommodation witli the SDLP, wh^|^0bld take a wide range of patters out of the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference, as serving eu~ interests.    There may be large-sc^K||emonstrations and other nns of protest action.    This under 1 inefM^mneed for care and sensitivity in presenting and operating t^^ AAeement.    Although in the atile atmosphere of Northern Ireland,  tha^^iwbation could deteriorate arpiy&gt; our present belief is that widespread violence and sustained ustrial action are not very likely.

12

The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) may engage in acts of  &apos; &apos;  r i sm designed  in part to provoke a violent uniooitf^reaction. Bui the &apos;3GSt assessment is that adverse reactions from both unionists and e PIra should be containable.    Contingency plans  for dealing with them been   reviewed. ^Rl

&quot;u&apos;   Irish are confident  that  they will be able  to seS^2^^proval ha Ule ASreement  in the Dail.    Mr Haughey,  the Irish opposT^^^eader, the a^&quot;reac*y signalled his opposition but   Ls likely to be consylKped by support which we hope the Agreement will receive from the SDLP.


I   INTERNATIONAL REACTION

Contacts with the United States suggest that the Agreement will be r^kmly welcomed by the Administration and by Congress.    It will also be ^%omed by our European partners.    There are indications that the United States may be ready to express its support by contributing to a fund for economic development in Ireland.    The Irish Government accepts that the bulk of the money should be spent in Northern Ireland     It will be a condition of the American contribution that the fund should be additional existing public expenditure in Northern Ireland and we understAimlhat the Chief Secretary, Treasury accepts this.

LEGAL CHALLENGE

15. Opponentolfhe Agreement in the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic may attempt to take legal action in the courts to prevent it coming into efrfXl^oth Governments are satisfied that any such legal challenge would fail.

CONCLUSIONS

16. The Agreement as negotiated represents a careful balance between British and Irish interests.    It falls well short of &quot;joint authority (which was the initial Irish aim) while according the Irish Government a means of exercising (and being j|en to exercise) an influence on British decision-making.    Although it does not involve amendment of the _ territorial clauses of the IrMjkstitution,  it commits the Irish Government formally, and for th^B*t time in an international agreement,   to accepting the exis^jS^atus of Northern Ireland and the continuation of that status for thWfof^seeable future.    It also contributes to the central British objective of improved and systematised cross-border security cofMation.    While providing new and important reassurances for unionisfcfkshould make it easier tor nationalists to identify with the instiTO^i of government and law enforcement in Northern Ireland, so undermining support for Sinn Fein and the PIRA.    Although there will be advei^^actions to it from both communities in Northern Ireland, we believe that it holds out a real nope of long-term improvement.    We therefore invite colleagues to agree that:

i. An Agreement should be concluded with the^Ah Government on the lines discussed.


ii. The Agreement should be signed by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach in November.

iii. The Agreement should enter into force after approval by k Parliament.

concerned with Northern Ireland; qRf^me of the matters nder consideration will involve co-operative action in both

Parts of the island of Ireland, and^os%ibly also in Great ritain.    Some of the proposals consiJ^wi in respect of orthern Ireland may also be found to have application by

e Irish Government.    There is no derogation from the oyereignty of either the United Kingdom Government or the

t, lsri Government, so that each retains responsibility for e decisions and administration of governmenl^iithin its
