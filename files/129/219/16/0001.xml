SECTION II ^NDERLYING PRINCIPLES

^^^^ Higher education may be regarded as an investment in the future, b^th^fpr the individual student and for the community at large. The indi&lt;^du^. stands to benefit greatly from higher education both in tangiM^wavs - through the ability of most graduates to command nisher

yy&lt;\ ,     mass tangibiy

than ave 2ge&gt;fearnings particularly in later life - and also

and more  ersp &amp;lly) through the opportunity to broaden horizons an through an a^jji^enrichment of life.(5) At the same time, the nation31 life and the na^onal economy stand to benefit from the contribution

\V f believeS

that suitably qualified students can make; indeed the Government

that it is vital for our higher education system to contribute more effectively to the imprpvitojent of the performance of the economy-There is also scope fon^pj^sponsorship by employers.

11.   The question needs to fJe^ctoressed whether the cost of higher

education is fairly distribure^JS^ween the taxpayer on the one

and the student (and his family)s4ks&amp;ie other. Under the presen

~   *nt&gt;s towards

the overall direct contribution o^fAjsMittents and their famiii*^

^&quot;&quot;/cvv m&lt; of the

contribution is made, that contribution4i^2oJ. The other 90$ is

by taxpayers who in the generality of cases^je likely to earn

3-9. SS being subsumrh J&gt;econunends that consideration should be given

in the general funding of institutions; ibid,


13. Another area in which some adjustment to the existing system coul

be made is in the length of courses for which mandatory awards would s r first

oab available. The Government is concerned at the extra costs 01

yj&amp;ree courses which last for longer than three years (four years in

&quot;^tfojttand). (4) One possibility would be to limit mandatory support to

a&gt;S^ ^eriod rather than to a set (first degree) level. This could

be^ixe^7at three years - and four years in Scotland. Support might

instea/^ eClamited to courses with a general educational content.

would nocg^r^lude a vocational orientation to higher education.

it would ligvg^hose wishing to undertake professional training to

look to spon^oror^nd potential employers, or to discretionary award  

for support, subjects such as medicine and architecture, which c

. . _ could

both general educational and vocational or professional training&apos;

be supported by mandaVjjcx awards up to the point where the trainin^gelf

began. Thereafter spcVhsofcLig employers (including the Government i

^/a&quot;SS lid presupP&quot;

in some cases) would stero iW. Any approach on these lines wouj-

v^-^v^x t the *&quot;1

to remove students from entitlemen^t^^tate benefits through       gcneme  ^

^7Py&lt;K ,.h1e with this

student support will be the extent to 4&amp;lc Vt is compatiDie     ^ble apPr p

SECTION IV LOANS

The most widely canvassed alternative to the present system is ountriei ltta#k in whole or in part. This would be in line with practice in other aWwo\ld be justified by the logic in Section II. It could also help

oveftfdmf^ome of the difficulties in the existing system mentionea

In\jD^/cular loans could go some way to redistributing part 0 jority of highe ^ct &gt;bation which at present falls unfairly heavily on the m of taxpaye^pfrj&gt; do not enjoy higher education or the lifelong adVSnta^tS| it can bring^fc^an scheme could also benefit students and their Par ^ albeit less dii^^y, insofar as it released resources which could peopie on improvements^ higher education. Moreover, it would encourage y0^ntage3 to consider carefully and in the light of career opportunities the and disadvantages of hirtJJejK education and of the various institution

courses open to them. T^i^^nNturn could influence the type 01 *

and help to increase the ICa^X* and standard of our higher educatlo

loan scheme

18.   Replacing the present gra^y^ystem, wholly or partly, by a        ^ Qf would produce substantial net sav^*^vkn the medium to long term.   ^ whiCh these would enable the Government fc L/&gt;tad the necessary resources

&apos;the UK system of student support, being based entirely of systems

unique in the western world. Although there is a great eater  r

elsewhere, most countries support students through loans   (l^^tq83 fr0lD tj&lt;

lesser extent. The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) swit  &lt;/A^W^red

a part loan/part grant-based system of student support to one ^^&gt;jASweden&apos;

on 100$ interest-free loans administered by the Federal Govern ^ ^ 6aW&gt; ^

the small basic grant received by all students is supplemented ^m^^

which now amounts to 90$ of the total award. In the Netnerlan^0pped

higher grants are given than in Sweden but are substantially        nt are (/^J

loans. Indeed, schemes involving loans to a greater or lesser     ^ too, ^

the rule rather than the exception throughout western Europe-


3 on loans for its students&apos; support. The complicated Federal and State rangements for student support in the USA also give prominence to loans, tn limited value grants available for the most needy. Whilst the experience &apos;\\\^hese countries is such as to encourage us to look to loans as a possible &lt;xV\ rward in the UK, caution is necessary in making international comparisons, s^^y\  interaction of the higher education, student support, social benefits in vf\&gt;$ystems varies from country to country. The various aspects discussed befo    m^^S 20 t0 2^ following wil1 therefore need careful consideration  #^^ision can be taken.

21.   Repayment requirements - Careful thought would have to be given grates and periods of repayment at levels that were geared both to what ^^si ^axpayer could afford through Government expenditure and to the former ^ ^M^ity to repay the loan. In some countries interest rates are charged &lt;/\&gt;&gt;&gt; merest is

are^rt^sidised compared with commercial levels. In the FRG no xn^ sUlts

cha^Qj/ynless there is default by the borrower; and good examination

can aiwTr^duce the amount to be repaid. Repayment periods may be Qui

conditioni^f^^ UK system might be; but the more significant the s   ^ ^

loans, the Wi^d ? the loans terms might be. For example, repayments ^

no repayment mig^t^e required until some time after course completi0

NOTES (1) The loan scheme exemplled above Is based on the following terms and assumptions: ^vO^&quot;&quot;^

(a)     The student population Is a constant 3BO,000 and all are on three year courses y^^xC^yy*

(b) The estimated average full value award, including allowances, Is  1,885. O^^vw^^

(c) Parental contributions are reduced from year 1 by 3.3% pa until year TO ($e amoral eventual reduction

of 33%). &lt;&lt;aI\S^&gt;

(d) Loans are for new students only - continuing students carry on i$fader^$JLsting arrangements.

(e) No interest is charged. ^

(f) Outstanding debts are revalued in repayment years in lifieNfith inflation subject to a 5% cap and are not revalued in study, grace or deferral years. /^sSc^

(g) There is a repayment grace period for all until^tieOsepond year after course completion.

(h) Repayment is deferred in years when earnings VaJ^&amp;elow 85% of average earnings.

(i) Loans are normally repayable over 15 ye^rfv^^^er the grace period.

(J) Debts are written off on death or^^fi^etBejre or after 20 years after the grace period,

(k) 1051 of repayments are defaultedC^^\

(1) Administration costs are ^e^I^e^

(2) The table does not show the cfasfi^f^Savoiding a poverty trap by allowing graduated repayments for those with between 85% and 100$ of average earnings. Information on income distribution makes costings hazardous but such a sliding scale for repayments^ffi^it reduce steady state savings by around  25-1 0M.

(3) The revalua^fo^j^See&apos;ssions ((f) above) make the public expenditure effects sensitive to inflation levels (apparent once retfaymnw become significant). They have been costed using data relating only to earnings, although in pr^m^V fe scheme would take account of all income. However, the effect of this on the costings is likely to
