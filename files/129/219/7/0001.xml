satisfactorily; though the PC9 is preferred ^J^^SL training hemg more suitabi; on handling and performance grounds the tasks.    The Tucano carries some programme and ^echn&quot;f &apos;tight enSine variant now proposed is not yet in service,jfJ^S^^t^U. txmeacale for introduction into service the risk is &quot;nsidere^e^  * costs, the Tucano at final bid is 10 per cent ^&quot;^&apos;/^^^rfter PC9 and slightly cheaper to run.    Even though BAe reduced


the competition had closed, their bid remained substantially higher (5 per

f&gt; cent). in terms of impact on industry and jobs there are arguments both &quot;V^sys, with the PC9 bringing benefits mainly to Humberside (320-350 jobs) and (210-230 jobs) and the Tucano to Northern Ireland (630-680 ttractive offset proposals from the engine manufacturers Pratt ey could give the PC9 a slight edge in job terms but the Garrett r the Tucano will effect 100 per cent offset.    Success is ly more important to Shorts&apos; corporate strategy than to that of regards sales prospects, whichever aircraft were chosen would be  -Competitor in world markets.    On paper the PC9 appears to have e a&lt;v^3X ge, but it is very hard to judge and there are more United 8floflr^jrs attached to each Tucano sold.    Whichever firm loses there 1 1 be %ofg /adverse or beneficial effects, as the case may be, on our

atlons\vith Switzerland and Brazil: and these will require careful handling. V

^*     The situation&apos;s thus very evenly balanced.    My military advisers&apos;

ear preference/ s&quot;Sitor PC9.    This, however, is arguably to judge the iUCan  by a moreVVevjwie test than the minimum standard the bidding ompanies were aske^Tg\meet in the specification issued to them.    In any e my military aityiefafa acknowledge that the Tucano meets the t^C1^ ications laid d^&gt;ra/Ahat they have not had the opportunity to fly to   aircraft with the w &lt;*/&amp;ower f ul engine and that it would enable them t^eturn out pilots of tt^^^uired standard.    In making the choice,  a^re^ore&gt; greater weight mj/^^necessar ily be given to non-operational 0rs than would otherwi^^ffeVNthe case.

The Procurement policy g^a^Jie strongest emphasis to competition,

an   present competition has be^^W^extremely lively and successful one by loweStanC*ar(*S an(* We wou^^ have &lt; *rfnaye good reason for turning down the fixed*&quot; k^d*    ^n this regard, Shor(^ %ay\&gt; a clear advantage, whether on a

The firm/pV^e is, of course,  the more set   v?US commercial test, and the places of the firm price contract would get     6 stanc*ard that we wish to see a^hfiSyde fence contractors follow, to arr 3Wa^ ^r m the era of variation of prVwe/^lauses and into contractual prean^eitlents which impose upon the compaTw^^lfhe discipline of managing cost resou^res themselves rather than coming to^the Government for extra

COMPARATIVE  ASSESSMENT  &quot;E CONTENDERS

1*     Four aircraft have been considered in the final round; three of them are products of overseas manufacturers who have&apos; 6ntered into a teaming arrangement with a British company With  a view   t0  manufacture   in   the   UK,    while   the fourth (Pir,ecracker)  is a British product.    The f&amp;ur    aircraft are:-

(a)    the Pilatus PC9 (Swiss),  to be manufactured by British Aerospace (BAe);

the Embraer Tucano  (Brazilian),  to be manufactured by Short Brothers Ltd;

(c&gt;    the Australian Aircraft Corporation A20 (Australian),  to be manufactured by Westlands Ltd;

Following   an  earlier   round   of   bidding,    &quot;best   and final

offers   were  invited   from   BAe   and  Shorts.     Westlands and

.   . v, j s was

Huntings  asked  to  join  in  the   final   round,   and   tni = , agreed.   &apos;,

2. The results of the best and final offers confirm the A2 0 and the Firecracker are uncompetitive on teen

lie3

and   cost   grounds,    and   that   the   choice effectively

between the  PC9 and  the Tucano.     The latest  proposal f r

n, the &quot;s

Tucano includes a new and more powerful engine from

better

firm Garrett,   which is judged  to give  the Tucano a

11 o u si y

performance   than  the  Pratt  and  Whitney  engine prev

proposed;     all   references   to   Tucano   below relate Garrett version.

specification  prescribed  by   MOD.     Both have been e*1

pro is the

pilots,   who have unanimously concluded that the r^?

sPeed&apos;

better aircraft.    The PC9 is marginally superior i&quot;

th ugh

especially at high altitudes,  and in rate of climb; the Tucano,  with a somewhat greater fuel capacity, woul

p vide rather more flexibility in the pattern of training s o r t i a

 Les      The   PC9&apos;s  performance,   and  particularly its band] i

iin8  characteristics,      are  more  akin   to   those of r ntline  aircraft;     by   providing  a  greater  challenge&apos; to students,   therefore,   the PC9  would in the RAF&apos;s view make Possible  speedier  development  of  training skills and quicker

dentification of  students suitable or  unsuitable  for comba&apos;t

ai r o 1 raft.  This said,   the Tucano too would provide training to

ac eptable but less exacting standard.&apos;

^ * T h n

ne Garrett engine proposed for Tucano would be a new  f an existing engine and the RAF would be the launch

custom e

r*     This  creates some  technical  risk but  not in MOD&apos;S view an

unmanageable  one.     And   the  Garrett   engine would

iniProve tk

tne performance of the Tucano.

Th

e a20,   unlike the other three aircraft,   has not yet and its performance can therefore be judged only from a

inc r-Porate

aue extensive design  changes,   including new engines, 0   ^-ODv

ve   performance  and   design   standards.     It   is not red that Huntings could produce the aircraft within

the ti0

Cost

6.      In the final round competing firms were asked to submit offers  for   130   aircraft   on   two   alternative   price bases, fixed  price   (ie  subject  to variation for changes in econ conditions)  and firm  price  (ie in cash  terms and  not su

are

to variation).    The results,  including ancillary costs, as follows:-

	 M	VAT EXCLUSIVE

	Fixed Price	Firm Price

PC9	1 26 . 8	164 .9

Tucano  (with Garrett engine)	131.4	1 58.9

A20	168.2	None quoted

Firecracker	160.5	198.3

It will be seen that the A20 bid is over 30? higher

  hi6her&apos;

cheapest   bid,    and   the   Firecracker   bid   some 25$

Prices were further  reduced  by  British  Aerospace an by mid-day Thursday 14  March to give the following:-

^f the main contenders,  and on the basis of the latest

Pri es Quoted by BAe and Shorts, the Tucano is cheaper than the pcq t_

if the Tucano were successful  Shorts would receive

entral Government grants of  4.6M; the Treasury advise that these &lt;sVi

snould  be  left  out  of  the- comparison.     Shorts have of f er&gt; .

HMg  a 2.5%   levy  on the price  of  any aircraft sold

oversea

as?    BAe have offered 1.555 on any sales in which they

take th &apos;  

ne lead.     Shorts&apos; price could be abated by some  2.5 M-

if M0D din

UJ-a not  take up the  proffered warranty and instead

j  el i ed

0n statutory and common law rights. 8.      On t

the basis of 25 year life  cycle  costs, discounted, the diftv

erence   between  the  PC9  and  Tucano  bids, although

relativeiv

*y small,   favours the Tucano.

 ^Ui^tria,

ajLd  emp] nYrpent factors

Th

e  Pc9  would  be  built.at Brough,   Humberside  and at Prestwi , . ^ in Scotland;    the Tucano would be built in Belfast.

BAe a pro

order would account for only a small part of

n vep,   but would provide some limited and temporary e in h

aealing with their problem of over-capacity. By

Oompariao

n    an order for Tucano would have a proportionately

h  igK

ger impact on Shorts&apos; business,  and DTI judge that it  G-O-NJIDENTTA.L COMMERCIAL  IN CONFIDENCE


CONFIDENTIAL  COMMERCIAL  IN CONFIDENCE

would fit in better with  the  company&apos;s long term strategy

. . _v wit&quot;

than would an order for PC9 in the BAe case;    the lm*

Embraer is considered to be capable of useful develop&quot;1 ef

An order for Tucano could strengthen Shorts as a comPetit

for refurbishment    and support work for  MOD.   Against this \

could  be argued  that by giving the order  to Shorts UU1

no further military new construction work is in prospec

would be promoting an extension of capacity in an 111

where over-capacity  already exists.

way  of  work  placed  in  the UK,   against  the value

to PiaC6
