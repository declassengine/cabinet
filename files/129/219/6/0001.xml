CONVEYANCING BY EMPLOYED SOLICITORS &apos;Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

 n 9 December 1983 (CC(83) 37th Conclusions) Cabinet considered the

uction of restrictions on conveyancing for reward.    Our main concern

was to introduce/^JoTnXetition for the independent solicitor to the benefit the consumer.UWeVconcluded on that occasion -

a      That we s\h ui4^examine extending the right to conveyance outside the legal profess^ays.    The Farrand Committee was subsequently set UP to examine this/^ p ^t.

D-     That the right tcr^Shveyance should be extended to solicitors, employed by banks andC^^ming societies, and that consultations on how to achieve this ob^cj^oAje and in particular to avoid problems of conflict of interest shon^^bk initiated as soon as possible.

^*     The Farrand Committee rep^t^d/ia September 1984;    the Government B1;qP       &apos;&quot;ts proposals and in con^^ce the Administration of Justice 0    &apos; at present before the House oi/ynx$.s, provides for the establishment new profession of licensed conv^j^rs.

q&quot;     p*e Problem of employed solicitorS^^^\aroved less tractable. Of f U   tations did not reduce concern abo&lt; ^^onf licts of interest. Comm^la^S ^ave undertaken further work buS^the Home and Social Affairs a8airittee W3S unaDle to reach agreement when they discussed the issues inter ^ ^ February 1985.    The crucial point is the degree of conflict of w uldeSt between the borrower and the lender and tha extent to which this bank fprevent the service offered by the employe^ofna building society or that   rora.c ntaining the same degree of protectionsf^vthe consumer as Provided by an independent solicitor or conve/imcay.

ensur^ ^enaing institution shares with the borrower aC^Wjjjr^n interest in and f^ S that the title is secure.    But in respect of tQj^m^rtgage terms his    lnancial advice generally the solicitor would have Ca^^pkt duty to Two         yer - whose interest would be opposed to those of^ft^^borrower. ossible solutions to this have been suggested:    first ,^ro^xempt


eniployed solicitors from the common law duty of employees always to act in \f-he best interest of their employers, and secondly to provide a so-called Ny&gt;asic service&quot; (see Annex A) which explicitly excludes advice on finance in particular on the terms and conditions of the mortgage.

CL

v^Cvje &quot;basic service&quot; which is proposed includes not only the actual   \V^P7cin8  ^ tne ProPertv but also the drawing up of the contract and

V*$yftr^n relation to the contract.    On many matters concerned with the COntr^^^Ke employed solicitor should be able to give advice freely. But some as  ^ Arouid again give rise to a conflict of interest, for example,

e purcha^rr may wish to contest restrictive covenants, but the building society uV^o be concerned with the maintenance of the value of the area because/vj^Xs lending on other properties.    Its own interests

erefore co^Ya tend to support the restrictions.

The other area in which there could be a conflict is the acquisition th ln^ormat^on by the_employed solicitor in the course of his duties for

purchaser which/*footd have a bearing on the decisions of the building Society in awarding\\the&gt; qrtgage (for example that the client might be aeclared redundant)!(7j)

^     It is, of course, tr^^Ajhat the purchaser could choose not to take the ^US^ness to tne emplo^ &lt; ^ylicitor.   There was, however, concern in So^   ^0mmittee that,  in reaW^r^/^he opening up of this market to employed 1Cltors would lead to a la^sJKiuimber of purchasers succumbing to the actions of &quot;one stop shopj^fig/j at a bank or building society wh   k   ess  f any warnings whic*^fca\t might be given, or restrictions so      mi nt be imposed.    This wd&amp;fa^raw true whether or not the building bv   6      ffered only a &quot;basic senwU^/or had its activities constrained y a Code of Practice. (yy\

co W0UI^ be fair to say that none^&gt; / ^ were convinced that the

quest 61&apos; C0U^ ^e entirely protected in&lt;   3&amp; circumstances.    The crucial benef^ &quot;&apos; w^^&quot;c^ we were unable to resolveN^raa^ly,  is whether the Solic^Cla^ economic effects justify our opwftrfg up the market to employed 1tors in the face of the lack of protection which would be involved.

essen^6re ^S n  P ^nt *n furtber consultation about this issue:    it is I t,    lfllly a matter of judgment where the greater/p&quot; $W.ic interest lies. erefore invite the Cabinet to consider: (f D

Whether solicitors employed by banks and b s cieties etc should be allowed to offer conveyancrajt/^ services. IKo^k

b

If so, what,  if any, restrictions should be impose k&gt; \ 0n the activities of employed solicitors whether by


exempting them from the normal common law duty always to act in the interests of their employer, or by restricting what they could provide to a &quot;basic service&quot;.

Privy CounTWppfice 4 March 1984 \&gt;


^ic^service

basic service&quot; seeks to minimise the risk of a conflict of interest SlnS      making it clear at all stages to the borrower that he could not ain -&quot;^dependent advice from the employed solicitor on matters where the erests of the lender and the horrower conflict.       The lending institution would  e required:

  to make it clear to the horrower that the employed solicitor ls not independent of the lender, and that anything the horrower &quot;tells the solicitor is in effect told to the lender;

1    to explain to the horrower at the outset that the horrower cannot obtain advice from the employed solicitor ahout his choice of lender, 0r about the terms and conditions of the loan (eg the rate of interest  r        reasonableness of the proposed retentions) or about any other matters on which the interests of lender and borrower may not c incide;

11    to inform the borrower that, notwithstanding   ii.,    the employed solipi +

tor may explain to him in a clear and straightforward manner

the &quot;Pi

J-inancial terms of, and the effects of the legal conditions ching to, the loan (eg provisions concerning early repayment)&apos;, tUt may not advise him on them;

where circumstances likely to lead to a conflict arise, to advise +h -U

wie borrower that it may be desirable to seek independent

advice.
