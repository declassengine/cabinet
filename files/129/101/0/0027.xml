Copy No. 6 1&apos;jlid&apos;i:qCABINETCOMMONWEALTH MINISTERS: DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITYMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations the Pakistan Government have enquired whether the President of pakistan and Ministers of the Pakistan Government will, when attending conferences inthis country, be entitled to immunity from suit and legal process in the same way as representatives of Foreign Governments. The question has probably beenprompted by an incident last September, when the Pakistan Finance Minister wasserved with a writ while attending a meeting of the Commonwealth finance ministers in London.2. Section 4 of the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges)Act, 1950, provides that when a conference is being held in the United Kingdomand is attended by representatives of one or more Foreign Powers, the foreign secretary can compile and publish a list of representatives of those Powers and members of their official staffs who shall enjoy the immunities conferred by lawor custom upon the envoys of Foreign Powers and their retinues.3. I need not go in detail into the nature and extent of the immunity thusconferred. In brief, the Act of 1950 is intended, not to absolve the persons concerned from compliance with the local law, but solely to exempt them, as representatives of Foreign States owing no allegiance to the State in which they are for the time being, from the jurisdiction of the local Courts, whether criminal or civil. So far as the criminal law is concerned, while a person entitled to diplomaticimmunity is exempt from arrest or service of process, it is possible, if the offenceis a serious one, to ask the foreign representative^ Government to waive hisimmunity or to withdraw him. In the last resort, the United Kingdom Governmentmay declare such a person to be persona non grata. So far as the civil law isconcerned, a person entitled to diplomatic immunity is similarly exempt fromthe jurisdiction of the local tribunals; in disputes of a civil nature every endeavouris made to induce the parties to reach a settlement by negotiation or possiblyarbitration, though in the last resort the Government concerned could be asked to waive the immunity. A person entitled to immunity cannot be required to attendany Court to give evidence, without the consent of his Government.4. The Attorney-General, whom I have consulted, considers that under united Kingdom law the President of Pakistan would most likely be entitled toimmunity from the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom Courts, but that ministers of the Government of Pakistan would probably not be so entitled. I feel thatincidents similar to that referred to in the first paragraph can be highly embarrassingand that it would be most desirable to legislate so that Ministers of commonwealth governments may be granted immunity when in the United Kingdom on officialbusiness, or as guests of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. I realise that there is oftensome criticism, both in Parliament and generally of legislation providing forimmunity of this kind. But, in my view, both Houses would accept such legislation as proper in respect of Commonwealth Ministers.C. (60) 775 th May, 1960Printed for the Cabinet. May I96056991
5. A distinct but related question has been raised by the commonwealth economic Committee. Under the Act of 1950 various immunities can be accorded to international organisations if they include one or more foreign Powers. Thereis no such provision for Commonwealth organisations, of which several are established here. The Commonwealth Economic Committee have now asked usto consider giving them as favourable treatment as is available under the 1950 Act.Tjheir request relates particularly to the liability to United Kingdom income taxdf Che Chairman and employees of the Committee (so far as concerns those not normally resident in the United Kingdom). While I have not yet examined the full implications of this request, I think my colleagues should be aware of it now, since it may prove desirable to consider this question also in the context of the widerproblem.6. Should my colleagues agree to the principle of legislation, as proposed inparagraph 4 above, I would suggest that we should explain our intentions informally to the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting before it ends, adding that, if this were the generalwish, we would be ready to introduce legislation at the earliest practical moment.Subject to agreement being reached at the Meeting, arrangements couldsubsequently be made for the exact form and scope of the legislation to be examined by the Departments concerned. A Bill might perhaps be introduced inthe next Session.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,5th May, 1960.
