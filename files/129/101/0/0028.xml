m(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 78 COPY NO.   ^96th May, I960CABINETCOMMERCIAL TREATY WITH JAPAN:PROBABLE EFFECT ON UNITED KINGDOM industries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 10th March the Cabinet approved a recommendation by the Presidentof the Board of Trade that we should resume negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan and be willing to consider the inclusion of a clause giving Japan most favoured nation rights in respect of quantitative restrictions, provided that it wasqualified by certain safeguards (C. C. (60) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2).   The safe-guards were to consist firstly of a list of sensitive products upon which we would retain the right anyway to maintain quantitative restrictions and secondly of thepower to reimpose restrictions in other cases if disruptive competition should be experienced.2. The Cabinet asked that the negotiations should be held in Japan not before the latter part of April.   They are due to start on Monday, 9th May.3. The Economic Policy Committee have considered a list of sensitiveindustries for which we should claim continued protection.   We shall make it clear to the Japanese that it would be our intention to maintain that protection even aspart of a generally satisfactory Commercial Treaty.   If, however, the japanese are not prepared to agree to provisions in the treaty that we would considersatisfactory, we would expect to retain restrictions on other items.   The Presidentof the Board of Trade consideres that it is not necessary at this stage to specifywhat these items would be but only to name the items which in any case we wouldnot propose to free from quantitative restrictions.4. The list of such items proposed by the President of the Board ofTrade is at Annex A.   The Economic Policy Committee recognise that, as this list accounts for products which make up about half of Japan&apos;s exports to the world,it will clearly appear unsatisfactory to them, but consider   that our experience of competition in third markets and the political considerations involved make it wise to propose such a comprehensive initial list.   We may, however, have to consider making some concessions in it, possibly by way of agreeing to reduce or abolishrestrictions over a period of years in certain cases.5. Annex B contains a list of goods from which we would remove import restrictions on the conclusion of a satisfactory treaty.   The Economic Poll cyCommittee   thought that certain items such as canned pilchards, ships and boats and clocks presented economic or political difficulties and they thought that our negotiators should be told that, in the event of the negotiation proving unsatisfactory and a need arising to extend the list of products on which restrictions would remain,these items should be given prior   consideration.1-
6. The negotiations will take a long time.   There are clear advantages in not hurrying particularly as both the Americans and Canadians are at present engaged in discussions with the Japanese and it may be interesting to see whatthey decide to do.   The Cabinet will be kept informed of the course of negotiations and consulted before  any binding commitments are entered into.   In the meantimeit is only necessary for the purpose of resuming the negotiations in accordancewith the Cabinet decision on 10th March to approve the list at Annex A of items which we shall declare our intention to keep restricted even on the basis of theconclusion of a satisfactory treaty.D.

ANNEX BGOODS AT PRESENT SUBJECT TO DISCRIMINATORYIMPORT CONTROL, TO BE LIBERALISED ON THECONCLUSION OF A COMMERCIAL treat.    Goods considered but not offered for liberalisation in connection withthe current trade arrangements.CANNED PILCHARDSThe United Kingdom industry is largely located in Cornwall withfew other employment opportunities.    It is likely to make vigorousprotests about liberalisation of imports from Japan, but it is alreadydeclining under duty-free competition from South-West Africa and imports from Japan are unlikely to make a significant difference toits position.    There is a tariff of 10 per cent on foreign imports.CLOCKS, MECHANICAL TIMING DEVICES, AND FARTSThere is bound to be some anxiety shown by the manufacturers ofclocks if imports from Japan are liberalised.    The industry wascritical last year of the liberalisation of imports of West Germanclocks.    The bulk of clock production is located in difficult employ-ment areas of Scotland and Wales.    There is no indication, however,that the Japanese industry will in the short term represent a seriousthreat to the United Kingdom industry.     There is a tariff of from20 per cent to 33 I per cent on foreign imports.FRUIT PULP AND FRUIT PRESERVED IN SULPHUR DIOXIDESOLUTIONThe United Kingdom industry is sensitive mainly about importsof strawberry, raspberry and plum pulp from Eastern Europe.There appears to be little prospect of significant imports from Japan.There is a tariff of from 15 - 25 per cent on foreign imports.OLEYL-CETYL ALCOHOLJapan already supplies a part of the United Kingdom market but does not take up her quota fully and is unlikely for technical reasons to make further substantial inroads.    There is a tariff of10 per cent on foreign imports.RUBBER MANUFACTURESThere is increasing Japanese competition in foreign markets butnot on a scale likely to lead to disruptive competition in the UnitedKingdom market.    There is a tariff of from 10 per cent to42 per cent on foreign imports.SCREWSUnited Kingdom manufacturers appear to be highly efficient andunlikely to be seriously challenged.    Nevertheless, the Guest Keen andNettlefold group of companies are likely to oppose liberalisationstrongly.    others  is a tariff of up to 20 per cent on foreign imports.-4.

SHIPS AND BOATS AND PARTSThe prospects of these industries are not promising as they arefacing a period of recession which is aggravated by the great increasein shipbuilding capacity in various other countries in recent years,notably Japan.    Although the removal of restrictions on imports from japan is unlikely to affect their position significantly the shipbuildersmay protest strongly.     There is a tariff on foreign imports of10 per cent on ships and boats of less than a gross tonnage of80 tons - all other ships and boats are duty-free - and 20 per centon parts.WIRE CLOTH, FENCING, NETTING AND MESH LESS THAN j&quot; MESHThe finer meshes of woven wire cloth were long protected for strategic reasons and there is some evidence that the Japanese arein a strong competitive position.     For these products as a whole,i. e. , including wider mesh, Japanese exports are of the same order as United Kingdom exports.    There is a tariff of 20 per cent onforeign imports.II.   Other Goods.ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS, FOLIAGE AND FRUITLiberalisation of imports from Japan is likely to arousecriticism because many elderly and disabled people are employed(many in their own homes) with few other opportunities for employ-ment.    The industry is already subject to keen competition fromEastern Europe and Hong Kong and the current annual rate ofimports is probably 2 to 3 times larger than United kingdom production.    Imports from Japan (of textile flowers similar tothose produced here) would increase the volume of the competition.There is a tariff of from 25 per cent to 42 per cent on foreignimports.BICYCLE, MOTOFv CYCLE, TRI-GAR AND TRI-VAN PARTS ANDACCESSORIESThis heading only covers parts;   liberalisation is unlikely to have a major effect on the industry.    With the merger betweenTube Investments and Raleigh Industries 70 to 80 per cent ofbicycle production will be in the hands of one firm.    There is a tariff of from 20 per cent to 30 per cent on foreign imports.(Complete bicycles, motor cycles, etc. , have already been offered to the Japanese for liberalisation.)COVERED RUBBER THRE.ADJapan is considered to be the industry&apos;s most seriouscompetitor, selling at prices well below those of our manufacturers.The home industry; however, employs less than 1,000 workers andis not concentrated in any particular area.    There is a tariff offrom 20 per cent to 22^ per cent on foreign imports.
DECORATED GLASSY/are most firms in the lead crystal (craft) section of the industry are located in Stourbridge where there is little alternative employ-ment.    The industry is subject to keen and increasing competitionespecially from well established glass producers in western european countries and Czechoslovakia, both in strictly comparabletypes of lead crystal and in more cheaply produced demi-crystal.Japanese production was small pre-war but there is evidenceof growing Japanese competition in such oversea markets asAustralia and the United States.    There is a tariff of from20 per cent to 30 per cent on foreign imports.DOWELSThese are only one product of the wood turnery industry whichis widely spread.    There is a tariff of 20 per cent on foreign imports.GLASS FIBRES, YARNS AND FABRICSThe United Kingdom industry which is still in a fairly early stage of development is expanding rapidly and it is unlikely that imports from Japan where the industry is also developing rapidlywould create more serious competition than imports from the UnitedStates, which are already liberalised.    There is a tariff of10 per cent on foreign imports;   the industry are applying for anincrease to 20 per cent.IMITATION JEWELLERYAlthough this is a Japanese export speciality, the UnitedKingdom industry is well established (mainly in Birmingham, Londonand Sheffield) and has the protection of a 20 per cent to 30 per centtariff on foreign imports.     Generally speaking, the industry hasmaintained its position in export markets such as Australia and theUnited States and should not suffer unduly from liberalisation.JEWELLERYThe United Kingdom industry is well established and japan sprimary interest is in imitation jewellery. There is a tariff offrom 20 per cent to 30 per cent on foreign imports.LEATHER GLOVESUnited Kingdom production in this craft industry (mainly smallfirms) has declined in recent years.    The industry is importantlocally in some small towns, especially in the West Country(e.g. , Yeovil).    These are manufactures which Japan might makecheaply, but there is no evidence at present of any considerableJapanese export.    There is a tariff of from 20 per cent to33-j per cent on foreign imports.
MOPEDS, SCOOTERS, PARTS AND ACCESSORIESThere may be some protest from manufacturers in this field on&quot;infant industry&quot; grounds.    The United Kingdom industry isexpanding more rapidly than the Japanese industry, and the mergerbetween Tube Investments and Raleigh will mean that all mopedproduction and a share of scooter production will be in the hands ofone strongly placed firm.    There is a tariff of from 20 per cent to 30 per cent on foreign imports.NON-TRANSISTORISED RADIO AND TELEVISION APPARATUS,RADIO-GRAMOPHONES AND GRAMOPHONESUnited Kingdom producers may protest strongly if importstake place on a substantial scale from Japan.    We have no experienceof the possible effect of Japanese competition in the United kingdom but, on the basis of their trade with other countries; we think theJapanese are primarily interested in transistorised equipment.There is a tariff of from 20 per cent to 33-3- per cent on foreignimports.OTHER LEATHER CLOTHING:  RUBBER AND PLASTIC CLOTHINGClothing made from these materials is not strictly a &quot;textile&quot;manufacture. But the Japanese can export it cheaply, and someUnited Kingdom firms who specialise in it might complain. the textile industries might also complain, as this clothing can besubstituted for &quot;textile&quot; coats and raincoats. It seems unlikely,however, that imports from Japan would be big enough to do serious damage to the textile or other industries.PENCILSThe United Kingdom industry is not located in speciallyvulnerable employment areas, but is declining because of competition from cheap Eastern bloc imports and because of the increasing useof throw-away ball-point pens.     The Japanese, however, are not likely to make serious incursions into the United Kingdom market.There is a tariff of up to 20 per cent on foreign imports.PLASTIC MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURESThere is a real danger that Japan may unload plastic materials at very low prices, as she may with the other organic chemicalsalready liberalised.    In both cases the industry is one wherecapital costs are high and the advantages of maintaining full production are great.    However, there appears to be no immediatedanger.    There is a tariff of from 10 per cent to 33-j per cent onforeign imports of plastics-   mainly 10 per cent.    The UnitedKingdom industry, the value of whose output is of the order of 100 millions per annum, remembering its experience when p.v.c.(a plastic material) was liberalised some four years ago, may bevery apprehensive and may protest vigorously.-7-
RUBBER AND PLASTIC FOOTWEARThe lifting of restrictions on imports from Japan will arouse furthercriticism from an industry already suffering severely from competition from Hong Kong.    It is unlikely that the Japanese product can competein price (over a tariff of up to 30 per cent) with that from Hong Kongthough it may be better in quality.    Production of cheap plastic-soledslippers is important in Rossendale and the largest manufactures of rubber footwear is located on Mersey eide.SCIENTIFIC AND PRECISION INSTRUMENTS, OTHER THAN &quot;PROCESS-CONTROL&quot; AND OPTICAL INSTRUMENTSThere must be some risk of Japanese incursions into this market,because of their rapidly developing skill in the use of transistorsand other electronic techniques, but the United Kingdom industry relieson its very advanced technology as a means of keeping ahead of the&quot;lost-cost&quot; countries.    There are few scientific instruments produced in large quantities.    Such major items as we have been able to test,e. g. , precision balances, do not appear at present to cause theUnited Kingdom industry serious anxiety.    There is a tariff of from15 per cent to 33-^ per cent on foreign imports.SPORTS GOODS, OTHER THAN - FISHING TACKLE AND GOLF BALLSThe industry considers itself particularly vulnerable to increasedJapanese imports of racquets and sports balls of all types.    However,although Japanese production of these goods is cheap, her exportsappear insufficient seriously to affect the United Kingdom industry at present.     Two items which seem specially vulnerable (golf balls and fishing tackle) have been selected for &quot;hard-core&quot; treatment.    There isa tariff of from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on foreign imports.UMBRELLAS AND SUNSHADESJapanese goods, although perhaps rather better in quality, arelikely to compete more with cheap imports from Hong Kong.    Thereis a tariff of from 20 per cent to 42 per cent on foreign imports.WIRES AND CABLESThe Japanese industry is relatively small.     There is a tariff offrom 17j per cent to 20 per cent on foreign imports.WOOL OR FELT HEADGEARThis small industry (the felt hat section located largely in the manchester and Stockport area) has suffered from the decline in demand for hats, shortage and high price of rabbit fur (a basic rawmaterial) and competition from cheap European imports.    Theproduction of felt hoods (the unfinished shapes from which hats aremade) is concentrated mainly in one factory in Northern Ireland.It is known that the Japanese can sell felt headwear overseas very cheaplybut there is no evidence that they at present export on a scale which
is likely to be a serious threat to United Kingdom manufacturers. Thereis a tariff of up to 33f per cent on foreign imports.GRAPEFRUIT, FRESHFRUIT, BOTTLED OR CANNEDGRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGE JUICE AND PREPARATIONS CONTAININGTHESE JUICESThe Japanese have little if any interest in exporting these products,apart from canned mandarin oranges which are already on openindividual licence from Japan.    We are Continuing to restrict importsof citrus products from the dollar area mainly iii the interests of west indies producers and if these restrictions are still in force when theTreaty is concluded some special short-term arrangement may benecessary for presentational reasons.HAMS, WHOLE, PRESERVEDUN AIRTIGHT CONTAINERSNo imports from Japan are expected.    Restrictions are maintainedonly against the dollar area as part of our general restrictions on pigmeatproducts, most of which are already liberalised from Japan.    If this restriction is still in force when the Treaty is concluded some specialshort-term arrangement may be necessary for presentational reasons.MAY, I960
