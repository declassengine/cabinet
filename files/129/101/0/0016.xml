THE PRIME MINISTERS AFRICAN TOURPART IINTRODUCTIONTowards the end of 1959 the Prime Minister decided to make a tour of thefour Commonwealth countries in Africa which have attained, or are nearing, full commonwealth membership South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria and the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In reaching this decision he was influenced by threeconsiderations. First, a visit to Commonwealth countries in Africa would roundoff the Commonwealth tour which he had undertaken in 1958. Secondly, he wasconscious of the rising tide of nationalism in Africa and wished to inform himselfat first hand of the problems to which this would give rise for the commonwealth and for the world at large. Thirdly, he recognised the specific challenge presented to the United Kingdom Government by the problem of constitutional advance inmulti-racial societies in Africa; and he hoped that, by a personal visit, he might help to focus public opinion at home on this problem and possibly to lift it to aplane above that of narrow party politics.2. It was not easy to determine the order in which these four countries shouldbe visited. But the Union, as the eldest in Commonwealth membership, was entitled to expect priority of consideration. It was also conceivable that the UnionGovernment might not welcome such a visit; and the Prime Minister felt that, if for any reason he were unable to visit South Africa, the value of the tour wouldbe so much reduced that the whole project might have to be abandoned. Fietherefore decided that enquiry should first be made of the Union government before any approach was made to the other three Governments. In the event theUnion Government welcomed the suggestion that the Prime Minister should payable visit to South Africa but said that, in view of the timing of the annual move oftheir Government from Pretoria to Cape Town, it would be more convenient forthem if he could defer his arrival in South Africa until the end of January. Thedifficulty was thus resolved. As South Africa was to be visited last, by the expresspreference of the Union Government, it became possible to plan the tour in therational geographical order--Ghana, Nigeria, the Federation and the Union.3. The Prime Minister left London on 5th January and returned on15th February. In Africa, the tour began at Accra on 6th January and ended atCape Town on 5th February. Excluding travel time, 5i days were spent in Ghana,6-?? in Nigeria, 8 in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and 10 in theUnion.The composition of the party accompanying the Prime Minister is shown in theAppendix.4. During the tour the Prime Minister travelled mainly by air. The longerjourneys were made, first in a Britannia aircraft chartered from B.O.A.C. (london to Accra, Accra to Lagos and Lagos to Salisbury), and later, in the Federation andthe Union, in a Canadair and a Viscount belonging, respectively, to the Federal andthe Union Governments. Shorter journeys, and journeys to centres with only asmall airfield, were made in smaller aircraft a Heron in Nigeria and Dakotas inthe Federation and the Union. After the tour ended the return journey was madeby sea to Las Palmas, in R.M.M.V. Capetown Castle which gave the PrimeMinister an opportunity to rest and to reflect upon the upshot of his journey andfrom Las Palmas to London Airport in a chartered Britannia aircraft of B.O.A.C.In all, the Prime Minister travelled 13,360 miles by air, 5,410 by sea and about800 by road. He spent one night in the air and ten at sea. The remaining 30 werespent at 11 different places. At only five of these places (Accra, Lagos, Salisbury,Pretoria and Cape Town) did he spend more than two consecutive nights.5. This African tour was very different from the Commonwealth tour of1958. Outwardly the pattern was much the same informal discussions withPremiers, more formal meetings with Councils of Ministers, civic lunches andreceptions, and visits to outstanding local examples of economic development.But, despite this appearance of similarity, the substance and purpose of the journeySECRET56647 B 2
was very different. In Africa the Prime Minister was concerned throughout withthe problem of race relations a problem of immense intellectual difficulty and onewhich can quickly arouse strong prejudice and bitter controversy. In the Federationhe had to engage in delicate private discussions on matters which threatened to divide the Governments of the Federation and of the United Kingdom e.g., thesubstance and procedure of the Monckton Commission, the future prospects of theFederation and the security position in Nyasaland. And in South Africa he hadto make plain to the Union Government the attitude of the United KingdomGovernment on such difficult questions as racial policy and the future of the high commission Territories. In these countries, therefore, he had difficult business to transact in his private discussions with Ministers. But the problem of public reference to these controversial issues was even more difficult. Almost anythinghe said about them in public was likely to give offence in some quarters; and, if hesaid nothing, he would be thought by public opinion at home to have failed in his duty. Finally, there was the additional difficulty that, with the rising tide of nationalconsciousness in Africa, this problem of race relations was uppermost in men&apos;sminds wherever he went with the result that he was constantly obliged to turnaside questions about it which were pressed upon him in Ghana and Nigeria before he had reached the countries where he was due to discuss it with those who bear adirect responsibility for finding practical solutions.6. Through all these difficulties the Prime Minister contrived to steer a steadyand consistent course. He did not shirk the controversial issues, but he stressedeverywhere the difference between private advice and public criticism; and in his public pronouncements he followed the course of concentrating anything he had tosay on these matters in a single policy speech in each of the countries visited. Inthose speeches he followed the line of re-stating the policy on racial questionswhich the United Kingdom Government are applying in territories for which theybear responsibility and leaving his hearers to draw what deductions they choseabout his attitude towards the policies of other Governments. His main speeches on these themes, at Salisbury and Cape Town, were generally applauded ascourteous but courageous affirmations of British policy.7. The texts of the main policy speeches in the four countries visited areincluded in this print. The texts of the many other speeches which the PrimeMinister made in the course of this tour are being collected in a separate volume,which will also include the records of his various Press conferences.8. The personal welcome accorded to the Prime Minister and Lady DorothyMacmillan wherever they went was spontaneous and impressive. Among thepeople there was evidence of a continuing warmth of feeling towards the UnitedKingdom and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the Commonwealth as a whole. As wasto be expected, this varied from place to place; but, even where it was least inevidence, there was enough to give a measure of encouragement for the future.The statements which the Prime Minister felt obliged to make on racialquestions won, everywhere, respect for the policy and point of view of the UnitedKingdom Government. Even in the Union they seemed to command the assent of a substantial proportion of European opinion.Perhaps the most encouraging feature, so far as concerned public speeches,was the enthusiastic support for any reference to the solidarity of theCommonwealth or to the contribution which it could -make towards a peaceful solution of the world&apos;s problems. It was gratifying to find that, even in thosecountries of Africa which are most deeply perplexed by the racial problem, theCommonwealth concept still seems to have a strong emotional appeal. There was,almost everywhere, an instinctive response to the thought that unity in theCommonwealth spells strength.9. This tour, like that of 1958, was a personal triumph for the Prime Ministerand Lady Dorothy Macmillan. On the social occasions, and on most of the visits to places of special interest, Lady Dorothy accompanied the Prime Minister. But,in addition, she undertook a number of separate engagements visiting Red Crossestablishments, hospitals, clinics, schools and other institutions for the welfare ofwomen and children.Her programme had, unfortunately, to be curtailed for a time as a result of a fall which she had in Northern Rhodesia. She slipped on the steps when enteringan aircraft **t Ndola airport and cut her leg severely.  After receiving first aid in
the aircraft, she was taken to hospital on arrival at Broken Hill, where the cut wasstitched. For a day or so she tried to fulfil her engagements while avoiding muchwalking; but at Pretoria she was obliged, on medical advice, to take two days of complete rest.10. This tour was certainly more arduous than that of 1958. In the early part of the journey the climatic conditions were more trying and, as these eased,the weight and the difficulty of the business increased. The amount of officialbusiness to be transacted, especially in the Federation and the Union, was muchgreater than in 1958. In three of the countries the Prime Minister was obliged to visit outlying centres. In Nigeria he had to go to each of the three regionalcapitals, as well as to Lagos: in the Federation he had to spend some time in eachof the three constituent territories: in the Union he had to visit each of theProvinces and each of the High Commission Territories. This involved a gooddeal of travel in smaller aircraft and a number of short stops. In Nigeria,particularly, the &quot; one-night-stands &quot; were especially exhausting. During the greaterpart of the tour early starts (at 7 a.m. or 7 - 30 a.m.) were the order of the day; andthese were more than usually tiring when the party was on the move and due to spend the next night at a different place. In the Union the Prime Minister onlymoved his headquarters once from Pretoria to Cape Town; and, although therewas much travel, the facility of returning at night to the same place was a welcomerelief.When the programme was being planned, the host Governments were askedto provide one rest day in each country and to reserve three hours each day for the transaction of United Kingdom business. In practice all the rest days were eateninto, by work or engagements, with the exception of a single day at the victoria falls Hotel. The hours reserved for United Kingdom business proved, only toooften, to be the hours of the afternoon during which all resident Europeans retiredto bed.11. Even so, despite the crowded programme, regret was everywhere expressed that the Prime Minister could not have stayed longer and seen more. At the endof the 1958 tour it was felt that the Prime Minister had tried to cover too many countries in the limited time available and it was suggested that on future occasionsit would be preferable to confine such tours to particular regions. It was contemplated that Africa (i.e., the four countries visited in 1960) would be one ofthese. But experience has now shown that even this involves an arduous journey,and imposes a heavy strain on the Prime Minister. The present Prime minister has now visited all the independent countries of the Commonwealth, save Malaya.It may therefore be possible for him, in future Commonwealth tours, to visit onlyone or two countries at a time. This would be more satisfactory to his hosts, as itwould enable him to see more of the countries visited and to meet more of their people. It should also mean, for him, a less crowded programme and a lessexhausting journey.

-&apos; - PART II.    GHANACOMMENTARYThe impact, and the value, of the visit to Ghana was more marked in thesocial than in the political sphere. No particularly important business was donein the talks with Dr. Nkrumah and his Ministers, but as an exercise in public relations the visit can be reckoned an encouraging success. From this point ofview the greatest value was secured from the occasions when the Prime minister was brought into direct personal contact with the ordinary people of Ghana.Particular highlights were the morning which he spent in the old part of Accra,which included a trip in a surf-boat and a visit to the market; and the afternoonwhen he drove through villages on the escarpment north of Accra on the return journey from Akosombo, the site of the Volta Dam. The market-women werevociferous, and plainly sincere, in their greeting. The drive through the country districts took on the appearance of an election tour.The genuine friendliness of the Ghanaians was everywhere apparent. Theyare uninhibitedly friendly, with no trace of colour consciousness. They valueEuropean assistance, both in administration and in commerce: on the other hand there is no exclusive reliance on Britain. They seem to retain from their Colonialperiod no feeling of particular attachment to Britain, no lingering loyalty, but nohostility either. Their initial welcome to the Prime Minister at the airport wasrestrained, and there were no popular demonstrations on the day of his arrival;but this may be explained by the fact that Accra is a very scattered city thereare no built-up areas between the airport and Governor-General&apos;s Lodge, to whichthe Prime Minister went. By contrast, when he drove through the main businessarea of Accra, accompanied by Dr. Nkrumah, there were large crowds to welcomehim, which had to be confined by crush barriers, and the cheering was loud andgenuinely friendly.In the business talks Dr. Nkrumah was evidently concerned to show himselfmoderate and reasonable. It might almost be said that he pulled his punches.The details are recorded elsewhere; it will be apparent that Dr. Nkrumah, even when discussing United Kingdom policy in East and Central Africa, a subject onwhich strong feelings are frequently whipped up in Ghana, was anxious to avoid any language which might offend the Prime Minister and to show himselfbroad-minded enough to understand the difficulties presented by multi-racialsocieties. The sympathetic understanding which had sprung up between the twoPrime Ministers at their first meeting in August 1958 was strengthened by this further meeting. No hint of this appeared, however, in those Accra papers whichare owned and controlled by the C.P.P., Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s Party; this distastefullywritten and mendacious Press continued its customary abuse of all colonial powers, including Britain, and did not spare the Prime Minister himself.The Prime Minister had set as one of the prime objects of his tour thegathering of views on Africa from every possible quarter; and he made a pointof seeing Opposition leaders in each country visited (special circumstancesprevented the full achievement of this in the Union). When in Ghana he proposedthat he should meet members of the United Party, Dr. Nkrumah at first objectedand it was only with reluctance that he was persuaded to acquiesce in a meetingat the High Commissioner^ residence. An account of the meeting is included inthis print. In the event neither the views nor the personalities of Mr. Dombo andhis colleagues struck the Prime Minister as particularly impressive. It must havebeen a consolation to Dr. Nkrumah that the Prime Minister went straight fromthis interview to a tea party to meet representatives of various &quot; Pan-African &quot;bodies. This meeting, arranged from the outset of the tour, was designed to bring home to the Prime Minister at first hand the aspirations of other Colonial and ex-Colonial territories in Africa. In fact, these supposed extremists listened withdeference and without expressed disagreement to a series of cogent and skilfullyphrased impromptus by the Prime Minister on the elements of democracy andthe peculiar problems of multi-racial societies.
From conversations at social functions it was evident that opinion in Ghanawas scarcely disturbed at all by the suppression of the Opposition, the decliningeffectiveness of Parliament and the domination of all aspects of public life by asingle party. It was noteworthy that among such prominent and non-politicalGhanaians as the Chief Justice, or expatriates such as Lady Jackson (BarbaraWard), the view prevailed that strong government was, at any rate for a period,so essential for a State in the first stages of its independence as to outweigh thedesirability of preserving to the full the rights and freedoms of a democraticsociety.The only part of Ghana that the Prime Minister saw was Accra and its immediate neighbourhood. Some regret was felt that he did not visit the north.The Ghana Government no doubt found it preferable that he should not be exposed to the influences hostile to them which he might be expected to encounterin a region from which the United Party derives the greater part of its strength.But a more decisive consideration was the importance of ensuring that the visitwould not be too strenuous. It was known that the Nigerian tour would bearduous, and the United Kingdom High Commissioner made a point of asking the Ghanaian authorities to spare the Prime Minister as much physical exertionas possible. It is noteworthy that the principal excursions from Accra were toAchimota College and Legon University on the one hand and on the other toTema Harbour and to the site of the proposed Volta Dam. Newly independent countries all show an understandable preoccupation with education and witheconomic development. And to them economic development finds its characteristicform in spectacular projects such as dams and harbour works whose massiveconcrete structures are instinctively felt to be the firmest proof of political independence.

RECORDS OF MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONSRecord of a Conversation between the Prime Minister and the Governor-general on Wednesday, 6th January, 1960, at 5 p.m.The Prime Minister told the Governor-General that he was going to seeDr. Nkrumah at 6 p.m. that evening and expected a number of points to be raised,in particular the Volta project, Ghana&apos;s constitutional position, Cyprus and theCommonwealth, the Central African Federation and the general position in Africa.On Volta, the Governor-General said that Dr. Nkrumah was determined to go ahead with the project, whatever anybody said and whatever the outcome of theInternational Bank&apos;s examination. He was of course weakening his position on the selling price of power by making it clear to possible consumers beforehand that the project would go ahead whatever the economics.On the constitutional position, the Governor-General said that Dr. Nkrumahwanted to be on the same level as Tubman and Sekou Toure. It was likely thathe would want The Queen to have a more special relationship to Ghana than thatof Head of the Commonwealth. This might cause complications with the otherRepublics within the Commonwealth. It was not yet clear what question would beput in the referendum to the Ghana people. It might ask them to state whether ornot they wanted a President.The Prime Minister explained the position about Cyprus and told the Governor-General what line he would be taking in his talk with Dr. Nkrumah later that evening.Turning to the Central African Federation, the Governor-General said that dr. Nkrumah might perhaps press the Prime Minister to see African leaders,especially in Nyasaland. The Prime Minister said that this would come badly fromone who did not want him to meet the leaders of his own Opposition! It wouldprobably be of great educational value to Dr. Nkrumah if he could travel to EastAfrica, where he had never been and see what conditions were like there: he didnot seem to realise that the position there was quite different from that in WestAfrica.In commenting on the political situation in Ghana the Governor-General saidthat, although the Government had a large majority in the National Assembly, the back-benchers did sometimes take an independent line and it would be an over-simplification to say that the Government used the Assembly as a rubber stamp. Itwas also true that the ordinary man in the street in Ghana did not feel that he livedin a country with an authoritarian Government, where the police were likely toknock on the door at night.The Governor-General said that he was rather worried about the plans that dr. Nkrumah had in mind for expanding his armed forces. This was difficultpolitically and would also affect adversely the economy of the country. The PrimeMinister asked whether the Governor-General thought it likely that there would bea process of Balkanisation in Africa, and particularly in West Africa. The Governor-General thought there might be some danger of this. The trouble was that manyof the frontiers in West Africa had been drawn on the map without regard toethnographical considerations and there was a strong danger of irredentism. It was rather unreal for Dr. Nkrumah to build up visions of leading Africa, as Ghanawas after all a small country compared, for example, with Nigeria.The Governor-General thought that Dr. Nkrumah was a good politician andan able leader. He certainly knew how to govern. He had no particular ideologyand so adopted a pragmatic approach, although coloured by the position that hehad taken publicly on black Africa. He was personally honest but theAdministration tended to be rather corrupt although not particularly so by Africanstandards. The Minister of Finance, Mr. Gbedemah, was an able and honest man:Mr. Botsio acted as his deputy and was very loyal, but he was not particularlyeffective and was clearly not a rival contender for the top job. The Minister ofEducation was perhaps the best of the other Ministers.The Prime Minister said that he had been greatly impressed by the atmosphere of cheerful independence which he had already sensed. There was neither hostilitynor servility. The Governor-General thought that this might be due to historicalreasons, as Ghana had built up its prosperity on the basis of a trading system andnot a plantation system.
The Governor-General thought that on the whole a Presidential system on theAmerican model might be the best political system for Ghana. He was howeverafraid that they would adopt only a part of the American system, and would dowithout the checks and balances. For example, it was unlikely that they wouldhave a Supreme Court that would be the final arbiter on the constitution. It wouldbe useful if Dr. Nkrumah could get himself advised by an expert constitutionallawyer on framing the constitution. The Attorney-General had been very usefulbut he was not a constitutional expert and it was desirable that expert advice shouldbe available, especially on such things as the machinery for amending theconstitution.Record of a Conversation between Mr. Macmillan and Dr. Nkrumah at FlagstaffHouse, Accra, on Wednesday, 6th January, 1960, at 6 p.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Mr. A. W. Snelling (High Commissioner),Sir Norman Brook, Mr. D. W. S. Hunt and Mr. T. J. Bligh.Dr. Nkrumah was accompanied by Mr. also Adjei, Minister of Foreign Affairs,Mr. Kofi Baako, Minister of Information and Education, Mr. Adu, Secretary, PrimeMinister^ Department, Mr. Dei-Anang, Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and(for Item 1 only), Sir Robert Jackson, Ghana Development Commission.1. Volta River SchemeMr. Macmillan said that he expected Dr. Nkrumah would like to talk first aboutthe Volta project. Dr. Nkrumah referred to the formation of the Volta AluminiumCompany (Valco) about which he was very pleased.Mr. Macmillan said that he was glad to know that the Government of Ghanahad now approached the International Bank. This would be helpful for two reasons. First, it would give a good basis for obtaining financial contributions from various different countries and organisations. And the support of the Bankwould also be of assistance to Valco in raising the necessary capital in the UnitedStates. Secondly, the Bank could provide valuable technical advice from outside the purely commercial sphere. The United Kingdom Government were anxious tohelp. They were looking forward to seeing the reports by Valco and by the WorldBank which would give an indication of the role which United Kingdom assistance should play.Sir Robert Jackson spoke briefly on the likely uses of the power to be produced by the Volta Dam. He said that there were forecasts, particularly of the expansionof the automobile industry, which would indicate that the whole power output of theDam might be used for the aluminium smelter. He himself would regret this, since he would prefer that some of the power output should be available for other purposes, particularly for rural electrification.2. Constitutional Change in GhanaIn reply to a question by Mr. Macmillan, Dr. Nkrumah said that he now hopedthat the inauguration of the Republic could take place in the first week in July.Work was already proceeding on the drafting of the constitution. When a draft was available, it would be debated in the Ghana Parliament and would later be put tothe country in a referendum. He would then wish to raise the matter with the other commonwealth Prime Ministers at the meeting in London in May.Mr. Macmillan said that there were two things which would have to be doneoutside Ghana. One was the preparation and passing of consequential legislation in the United Kingdom. We would have to legislate about commonwealth preference, nationality, &amp;c, as we had done for India and Pakistan. This wouldhave to be fitted into a crowded Parliamentary programme. He remindedDr. Nkrumah that Parliament would rise for the summer recess by the end of July.He suggested that it would be useful if talks could be held in London as soon as theGhana Government had worked out the details of what they had in mind.Dr. Nkrumah said that this was entirely in line with his thinking. He thought thatthe Ghana Government would be ready to have such talks in London about the endof February.
Mr. Macmillan said that the other action required was to get the agreement ofall the members of the Commonwealth to Ghana remaining in the Commonwealthafter having become a Republic. This could best be done at the meeting in May.Such a procedure would be in accordance with precedent. If all the Prime ministers agreed this would be recorded in a resolution carried at the meeting. Dr. Nkrumahsaid he quite understood what was required. He asked if he could be given copies ofthe resolutions passed in respect of India, Pakistan and Ceylon; Mr. Snellingundertook to provide these.3. The Commonwealth AssociationDr. Nkrumah said that he would like to mention one or two matters concernedwith the Commonwealth relationship which gave him some concern. TheCommonwealth, as he understood it, was an association of independent sovereignStates. For his part, he was anxious that nothing should be done which might throwdoubt on the full independence of its members. He had therefore been disturbed bythe suggestion that Cyprus might enjoy some special form of association with theCommonwealth. He also found it difficult to understand why an invitation to attend meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was extended to the Prime Ministerof the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which was not a fully independentcountry.(i) CyprusMr. Macmillan said that he was glad to have this opportunity to explain the objectives of the United Kingdom Government in respect of Cyprus and the stagewhich the negotiations had now reached. Cyprus had not been a Colonial problem:it had been a problem of international relations our task had been to find a meansof reconciling the interests of the Greek and Turkish Governments in the Island.After much difficulty an agreement of principle had been reached in the conferencesof 1959 in Zurich and in London; and for some months detailed discussions hadbeen proceeding with the aim of working out the practical application of the agreedprinciples. The date fixed for the declaration of an independent republic in Cypruswas now very near; and the United Kingdom Government had decided that thebest way of bringing these detailed discussions to a conclusion would be to convene a conference of the Foreign Ministers of the three Governments and therepresentatives of the two communities in Cyprus at which a final agreement couldbe concluded He hoped that this conference would be held in London about themiddle of January.It was still an open question whether the Cypriots would wish, after attainingtheir independence, to remain in association with the Commonwealth. Their wishesin this matter were not yet known. It was possible that their attitude might become more clear in the course of the forthcoming conference in London. But, in any event, there could be no question of Cyprus becoming a full member of theCommonwealth except by the unanimous decision of all the existing members. TheUnited Kingdom Government alone could not do more than accord to Cyprus some special form of association with the Commonwealth falling short of full membership; and it was not yet clear whether the Cypriots would in fact be willingto accept any such form of association. It might turn out that they would prefer,on attaining their independence, to sever their existing links with the commonwealth and to become a foreign country. But, whether they did that or whether they accepted the special form of association which had been suggested, it would in eitherevent be open to them at a later stage to apply for full Commonwealth membership.The decision on any such application would rest with all the existing Commonwealthmembers.(ii) Federation of Rhodesia and NyasalandMr. Macmillan said that it was, admittedly, an anomaly that the Prime Ministerof the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland should attend, as an observer, the meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. On the other hand this anoipaly was of a respectable antiquity. It derived from the fact that Southern Rhodesia had previously enjoyed the unique status of a &quot;self-governing Colony&quot;; and on that account its Prime Minister had for many years been invited to attendCommonwealth conferences as an observer. When Lord Malvern ceased to bePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and became instead Prime Minister of thenew Federation, the other Prime Ministers had all felt that, as he had attended their meetings for so many years, it would be appropriate that he should continue to
attend in his new capacity. This was the origin of the present practice. On the otherhand it was clear that the Prime Minister of the Federation attended only as an observer. For example, he was not present on occasions when the commonwealth prime Ministers considered constitutional questions e.g.,- the admission of a new member. This marked the difference of status between him and the other PrimeMinisters.Dr. Nkrumah said that it would be helpful if this fact could be made public.If at the forthcoming meeting in May the Prime Minister of the Federation did notin fact attend the sessions at which the Prime Ministers considered whether Ghanashould remain within the Commonwealth after becoming a Republic and whetherNigeria should be admitted to Commonwealth membership on attainingindependence, it would be valuable if it could be publicly stated that he had not infact participated in those discussions.Dr. Nkrumah also suggested that it would be convenient if the term &quot; theCommonwealth &quot; could in future be reserved as a description of the association ofthe independent member countries of the Commonwealth. It was confusing and,from Ghana&apos;s point of view, inconvenient that it should sometimes appear toinclude dependent territories whose constitutional relations were confined to theUnited Kingdom or to some other individual member of the Commonwealth.Mr. Macmillan said that this was a point which might be considered perhapsat the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.4. Constitutional Progress in AfricaDr. Nkrumah said that he would like to speak about Ghana&apos;s attitude towardsnationalism in Africa. The Government of Ghana were sympathetic towardsnationalist aspirations in other parts of Africa. They looked forward to the day when all the dependent territories throughout Africa would attain their independence. They recognised that it was the policy of the United KingdomGovernment that British dependent territories in Africa should advance towards self-government as rapidly as possible; and there was, therefore, no difference ofprinciple between the Governments of Ghana and of the United Kingdom so faras concerned the ultimate objective of policy. The point on which a difference ofopinion might arise was the speed at which the advance towards independenceshould proceed. The Government of Ghana would naturally like to see a more rapid rate of advance.Dr. Nkrumah suggested that it would be helpful if the two Governments could agree upon some joint statement of policy in this matter. He was bound to make public statements supporting nationalist aspirations in various parts of Africa.He could not appear to be deserting his friends. But at the same time he was anxious to avoid making statements which might be embarrassing to the UnitedKingdom Government. He believed that there was in fact an identity of view on the ultimate objective of policy. This being so, it would be helpful if someformula could be found which would make this plain. He had discussed this possibility with Lord Home some little time ago. He would be glad if it could now be followed up.Mr. Macmillan said that it would be useful if he and Dr. Nkrumah could havea full discussion on this subject. He would be glad if a further meeting could bearranged for this purpose. Meanwhile, in the relatively short time available that evening, he could give only a preliminary outline of his views.He thought that Dr. Nkrumah would agree that in this matter the record ofthe United Kingdom in Africa was good. Ghana had already achievedindependence. Nigeria would become independent later in I960. Sierra Leonewas moving steadily towards the same goal. In Gambia the next election wouldbe held on the principle of &quot; one man, one vote &quot;. In British Somaliland, despite the local difficulties, good progress was being made towards independence. In Tanganyika there would be an African majority in the legislature in 1960. In the face of this record no-one, he thought, could doubt the good faith of the UnitedKingdom Government and their determination to implement the general policy to which they were pledged. They were in fact determined that, in all the dependent territories for which they were responsible, the pace of constitutional advanceshould be as fast as was practicable in the local circumstances. Due regard musthowever be paid to the local circumstances; and it was a relevant consideration
that in many parts of East and Central Africa the indigenous populations werefar less advanced, and to that extent less capable of accepting the responsibilities of self-government. Nyasaland, for example, was a poor and backward country by comparison with some of the West African territories and it would certainlyneed a substantial measure of economic support for some time to come. Even in kenya, when the British first went there 60 or 70 years ago, conditions were soprimitive that the potter&apos;s wheel was unknown. These considerations alone wouldmean that the pace of constitutional advance could not in any event be as rapid inthose parts of Africa as it could in some of the West African territories. But, inaddition, the problem was further complicated by the existence of racial minorities,whose interests must be safeguarded. This was not solely a problem of the whitesettler: in most of these territories there were large Asian communities too; and constitutional solutions must be found which took account of these minorityinterests. The European settlers had, after all, a considerable stake in these territories. They had been there for a long time: indeed, in the Union, theAfrikanders had been settled in the Cape Province since the 17th century andeven in Kenya there were European families which had been established there for two or three generations and had no other home. Moreover, they had made asubstantial contribution towards the economic well-being of the territories. Forthese territories, therefore, a constitutional solution must be sought on the basisof a multi-racial society. It should be possible for these various communities to live together; and it was the duty of all concerned to seek constitutional means bywhich they might be enabled to do so. The multi-racial society was not a problemsolely for Europeans and Africans. Even in Africa, as he had said, there wereIndian, as well as European, minorities whose interests must be safeguarded.And elsewhere the multi-racial problem presented itself in forms which did not include Europeans at all e.g., in Malaya, where satisfactory progress was beingmade towards an acceptable solution.Mr. Macmillan said that political leaders in Ghana and in Nigeria could make a valuable contribution towards the progress of constitutional advance in east and Central Africa. If they continued to show that in their territories, after independence, Europeans were treated fairly and that due regard was paid totheir interests, this would help to give greater confidence to racial minorities in east and Central Africa.Dr. Nkrumah said that the problems of constitutional advance were certainlyless in those African territories where there were no European settlers. He himselfattached importance to the principle of &quot; one man, one vote &quot;; but he recognisedthat, in territories where there were important racial minorities, the constitutionalsystem must include proper safeguards for their interests.Mr. Macmillan and Dr. Nkrumah agreed to resume their discussion on thissubject at a meeting on the following day.Record of a Conversation between Mr. Macmillan and Dr. Nkrumah at FlagstaffHouse, Accra, on Thursday, 7th January, 1960, at 12 noonMr. Macmillan was accompanied by Mr. A. W. Snelling (High Commissioner),Sir Norman Brook, Mr. D. W. S. Hunt and Mr. T. J. Bligh.Dr. Nkrumah was accompanied by Mr. also Adjei, Minister of Foreign Affairs,Mr. Adu, Secretary, Prime Minister^ Department and Mr. Dei-Anang, Secretary,Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Constitutional Progress in AfricaMr. Macmillan said that he would like to enlarge on what he had said, at themeeting on the previous evening, about the general problem of constitutional progress in Africa.In the territories inhabited by homogeneous communities the pace of constitutional advance could be left to be determined by the rate of developmentof an indigenous administrative and legislative machine. Dr. Nkrumah was, hethought, content with the progress which was being achieved in those territories 
though, even there, there were risks in going too fast, as was illustrated by recent experience in the French Cameroons. In East and Central Africa, on the otherhand, the position was different because of the special problem of racial minorities.In Rhodesia and Nyasaland the position was particularly difficult because of the disparity of the economic position of the three territories. Nyasaland was a poorcountry, characterised by a low level of subsistence farming. Northern Rhodesiawas more prosperous, because of the copper deposits. Southern Rhodesia, on theother hand, was a prosperous territory with a high standard of agriculture due mainly to the efforts of the European community. The United KingdomGovernment had taken the view that a viable economic unit could be formed by,some ,sort of federation between these three territories. But they had undertakenthat they would not withdraw their special responsibility for the two northern territories until the populations there had themselves been convinced that their best prospects for the future lay in some form of union with Southern Rhodesia.The United Kingdom Government were not wedded to any particular form of federal structure for these territories: there was a wide scope of choice between different forms of federation, and all these matters would be studied by theMonckton Commission. But, whatever constitutional solution was ultimatelypreferred, it must plainly provide adequate safeguards for the interests of thelarge European community which had been settled for many years in these territories and had contributed so much to their economic progress. As he had said on the previous day, he firmly believed that it should be possible to find some means by which the various communities could live peaceably togetherserving, as they did, the interests of one another. But, if this was to be achieved,there must be a substantial element of give and take and toleration of the views and interests of others. Certainly no progress would be made if either side insisted on maintaining extremist views on the racial question. He could not yet say what the final solution would be. He believed that, with good will, a solutioncould be found. But he recognised that this would be a difficult task, and he feared that constitutional progress would have to be fairly slow. Meanwhile,political leaders in Ghana and other parts of West Africa could make a usefulcontribution by impressing upon African opinion in the Federation the needfor patience, and by encouraging European opinion by their own example oftolerance and co-operation. There was no doubt that the worst course, for africa as a whole, would be to allow a violent struggle for power to develop between theracial communities in these territories.Dr. Nkrumah said that it was unfortunate that African opinion in Nyasalandhad developed so strongly against the Federal Government. Mr. Macmillan saidthat the best course now was to convince the people of Nyasaland that it was forthem to determine the course of their own constitutional development; for, ifthey were satisfied that the form of government in Nyasaland was a matter fortheir own free choice, they might be able to see more clearly the economic advantages which federation would bring. Dr. Nkrumah agreed that the Africancommunities were more likely to see the issues clearly if they felt that they had a free choice.At the end of the discussion Dr. Nkrumah said that he had prepared a short statement of the views of his Government on the general African situation. Hehanded over a copy of this document (reproduced in the Annex to this record)and suggested that Mr. Macmillan should study it. He hoped that it would befound that there was much common ground between views held on this subject by the Governments of Ghana and of the United Kingdom.
AnnexGENERAL AFRICAN SITUATIONStatement of the Views of the Government of Ghana1. Ghana believes that freedom for Africans on their native continent isessential for World Peace.2. The great wave of nationalism at present sweeping Africa is a fact whichshould be recognised; it is a force which no one can hold in check and there forfeit should be co-operated with in the best interests of all concerned.3. In so far as territories with no minority settlers are concerned, the wayappears to be clear for a planned phasing of progress towards independence.Ghana believes that the peoples of these territories will measure up to the responsibilities demanded by definite prospects of self-rule and will themselvespropose a realistic time-table.4. In multi-racial territories, the difficulty of formulating a constitution whichwill ensure safeguard for the minority communities arises. The following conditionsappear to Ghana to be essential prerequisites to a just solution:(a) The principle that the majority of the people, i.e., Africans, should formthe basis of Government in these territories should be accepted.(b) The African should be made to feel in his own country that he is a first-classcitizen and that he is not discriminated against in any way.(c) The African political leaders should be permitted to share the responsibilityfor taking decisions on the political and constitutional future of their territories.(d) The African political leaders should be consulted on the policy and time-table for independence.(e) There should be safeguards written into the constitutions for minority communities to assure them that they will not be discriminatedeconomically and socially and that they will still have a constructivepart to play in the political and economic life of the country so longas they do not seek to perpetuate inequitable positions of privilege.(/) Ghana believes that, provided the African communities are made to feelthat they are trusted as responsible people with a stake in their ownterritories, they will show a responsible and co-operative approach tothe problem of deciding the future of these territories.
Record of a Discussion with Leaders of the Parliamentary Opposition, held at theHigh Commissioner^ Residence in Accra on Saturday, 9th January, 1960, at p.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Mr. A. W. Snelling (High Commissioner)and Mr. T. J. Bligh.The Leader of the Opposition, Dr. Danquah, was accompanied by Mr. Dombo,Mr. Odamtten, and Mr. Appiah (who joined the meeting half-way through).After an exchange of courtesies about Dr. Danquah&apos;s books and the institution of a school of law in Ghana, Mr. Macmillan asked Dr. Danquah what were themain issues between the Opposition and the Government in Ghana. Dr. Danquahreplied that there were two :(i) The Opposition asked for a constitution backed by the whole country.(ii) The Opposition rejected the centralisation of power in the Government.In discussion on the first point Mr. Dombo said that the Opposition had alwayswanted a second Chamber, whereas Dr. Nkrumah thought one Chamber was right.The United Party wanted a constitution backed by the whole country, theGovernment wanted a constitution settled by their own party. The presentChamber consisted of 104 seats, with everybody over 21 voting. Constituencieshad been drawn up by an electoral boundary commission, but this was no longer in being and no machinery had been devised to re-draw the boundaries to meetthe change in conditions in Ghana as the country became developed. At the lastelection there had been a number of parties standing, including the C.P.P. and insome of the constituencies there had been a number of candidates. after independence all the Opposition Parties had merged into the United Party.Mr. Macmillan asked whether the United Party were afraid that the country might drift into a one-party system. Mr. Dombo replied that it was already doing so. Thus, the question whether or not Ghana should become a republic had notyet been put to the people, and yet the C.P.P. were assuming that a republic wouldbe established. The United Party did not know what form of constitution theGovernment had in mind for the republic.On the second point Mr. Dombo said that the United Party wanted regional assemblies, but local responsibility was at present devolved to DistrictCommissioners, who were paid by the C.P.P.Mr. Macmillan asked if it would be fair to say that there was a real differencebetween the United Party and the C.P.P. on the general political structure of thecountry. Mr. Dombo replied that this was so. The C.P.P. policies all seemed topoint in one direction namely, a state and system of government such as that inRussia.Mr. Macmillan asked whether the strength of the support for the United Partyin the country differed from one place to another. Mr. Dombo said that this was so: they were stronger in the north and in the Ashanti district than they were inthe south. Dr. Danquah added that in the election of 1956 the United Party had secured 336,000 votes against 343,000 of the C.P.P., but owing to the heavy loadingin the Ashanti district they had only secured 32 seats as compared with the 72 ofthe C.P.P. He did not know when the next election would be, perhaps in 1960 or1961, but the results would be interesting as the United Party thought their support in Accra was growing.Mr. Dombo said that there was also a difference between the two parties onforeign policy [at this stage Mr. Appiah joined the discussion]. The C.P.P. favoured a policy of positive neutralism, whereas the United Party wanted more openly tosupport the &quot;West. He thought it was illogical of the C.P.P. to claim to be neutralistwhen they were following a policy of creating blocs in Africa.Mr. Dombo said that Ghana had no armaments of any significance and wasnot really concerned with the military balance between the East and the West.The United Party were entirely concerned with the spiritual values and this wasthe reason that made them support the Western way of life. Mr. Appiah addedthat 113 years of British rule in the Gold Coast had imbued all Ghanaians with adeep respect for the British way of life, based as it was on the twin principles ofthe rule of law and personal liberty. He thought it was hypocritical of the C.P.P.to sit on the fence. It was also illogical of them to say that true freedom couldonly come from republicanism. The United Party knew that personal liberty couldbe enjoyed under the British monarchist system and felt that there was a largeSECRET56647 d 2
majority in Ghana which supported the monarchy. It was interesting, addedMr. Appiah, that the question of republicanism had never been raised in 1957.Mr. Macmillan suggested that it would be inexpedient to identify the differencebetween the two Parties as one of republic versus monarchy. What mattered wasthe shape of the Government, the power of Parliamentary institutions, the existenceof an Opposition, and so on.Mr. Appiah said that the people had not yet been consulted on the form of are public. This was an issue that would have to be fought out between the two parties.Dr. Danquah said that the United Party might well have to refrain from pressing their preference for a monarchical system. It would be difficult for the firstfree African State to accept a white Queen.Mr. Macmillan said that there were different types of Presidential Government:(i) The Indian example, which really treated the President as a constitutionalmonarch. The Ministers forming the Government were in parliament and there was an effective Parliamentary system:(ii) The American pattern, where Ministers were not in Congress but wherethere were a great number of checks and balances and an all-powerfulSupreme Court;(iii) Less democratic examples, where the President was in a very strong position.Mr. Dombo thought the danger might be that Ghana would become a Republicbased on the American pattern without any of the checks and balances. He was particularly troubled at Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s recent appointment as Secretary-Generalof the C.P.P.Mr. Appiah then referred to the proposed boycott on South African goods, asan indication of pressure in the United Kingdom for South Africa to leave theCommonwealth. If tests of behaviour were to be applied to Commonwealthmembers, Ghana might equally have to leave the Commonwealth. But he himselffelt satisfied that in the whole of Africa the great majority of the people would optfor the Western way of life. The Commonwealth had a great part to play inmobilising that opinion. The United Party endorsed the Commonwealth because it stood for the twin principles of the rule of law and the liberty of the individual.If the Commonwealth were to put itself in the position of appearing to condonesuch practices as detention without trial it might become tarnished in the eyes ofthe African peoples. He wondered that people in England complained only ofthe behaviour of South Africa.Dr. Danquah agreed that the greatest contribution the United Kingdom had made to the whole world was what was known as the British way of life. He thoughtit would be useful if the United Kingdom Government could summon a conferenceof all African territories to consider a new Charter. Mr. Macmillan might say something on these lines on his return to the United Kingdom.Mr. Odamtten said that Mr. Macmillan would have seen for himself that thepeople in Ghana were not violent. Yet the C.P.P. had deported people and lockedothers up on the alleged grounds of public security. This was all nonsense.Mr. Macmillan said that it had taken a long time to get the rule of law established in the United Kingdom, and it needed a continual effort to keep the system in balance. And from time to time, in emergencies, it was necessary for the security ofthe State that the Government should for the time being encroach on thesehard-won liberties. It was up to the Opposition in Ghana to fight for their idealsby trying to win votes and to seek power in an honourable way. He was remindedof a sentence from the Epistle for the third Sunday in Advent &quot; Judge not, save inthe fullness of time &quot;. It was difficult, he knew, to be patient, but it was necessary.They must remember that, in trying to get other people to change their minds, itwas possible to say things in ways which would not exacerbate the situation. Theymust also remember that the United Kingdom was only one among a number of equal partners of the Commonwealth. It could not order other commonwealth countries to follow the principles of liberty. It might be that as dependent countriesattained their independence some of them would turn to a authoritarian regime.Indeed, some might think that in the future we should have a totalitarian world.He himself could not believe that this would come about, and we must all fighton with patience and determination. He would devote what was left of his lifeto trying to steer the Commonwealth along those lines.
Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and the &quot; Pan-African Activists &quot;held at Flagstaff House, Accra on Saturday, 9th January, 1960, at 5 p.m.Dr. Nkrumah suggested that during his stay in Accra Mr. Macmillan should meet the Pan-African Activists so that he could &quot; see what he (Dr. Nkrumah) hadto put up with&quot;. Mr. Macmillan agreed to see them and a meeting atDr. Nkrumah&apos;s house was accordingly arranged. Amongst the organisationsrepresented were:The African Affairs Centre,The National Association of Students Socialist Organisation,The Ghana Trades Union Congress,The All-African People&apos;s Conference Secretariat.2. A list of those present is attached. Mr. Koinange of Kenya who had been invited was dissuaded by Mr. Dei-Anang from attending when it was made clearthat it would be embarrassing to Mr. Macmillan to meet him as there was a detention order outstanding against him in Kenya.3. Mr. Macmillan, who was accompanied by Mr. A. W. Snelling (HighCommissioner), Sir Norman Brook and some of the other members of his party,was introduced to those present and then sat down with about ten or fifteen ofthem who plied him with questions.  Dr. Nkrumah was not in the circle.4. The following are some of the questions that were asked and the repliesgiven by Mr. Macmillan :(a) Was not &quot; one man one vote &quot; a proper democratic procedure, and whydid we not grant this franchise, especially in Kenya and the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland?Mr. macmillan dealt with this question by pointing out how verybackward for the most part the indigenous people of the federation and Kenya were compared with the West Africans. He mentionedthose tribes who until well into his own life-time had not even inventedthe potter&apos;s wheel. It was a mistake to think that these people were as ready for democracy which was an advanced form of Government as were the people of Ghana or Nigeria. He asked if any of those present had ever seen Kenya or the Federation and none had.Secondly, he pointed out that, although &quot; one man one vote &quot; was an important feature of democracy as practised in Europe and north america, it was not by any means the only or most important feature.An equally important point was that in a democratic country theGovernment should show by its every word and deed that it considereditself to be in power only temporarily and that it was not in for good.He said that when asked for his address he always said his temporaryaddress was 10 Downing Street. The Pan-Africans took the point andno more was said on that topic.(b) Why should Sir Roy Welensky attend meetings of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters when the Rhodesian Federation had not attainedindependence, while Abubakar was not being invited though Nigeriawas on the eve of independence.Mr. Macmillan explained in detail the constitutional steps whichhad still to be taken before Nigeria became independent and empasisedthat the procedure would follow exactly that adopted in respect of malaya and Ghana. He said that the attendance of Sir Roy Welenskywas anomalous but followed the practice of some 20 years standingunder which Lord Malvern, as Prime Minister of what was then called the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia, had been invited asa courtesy and not as a right to attend these meetings. He said that,when the Federation was formed and Lord Malvern became its firstPrime Minister, it was natural to ask him to come as hitherto, and when sir Roy Welensky succeeded Lord Malvern invitations were extendedto him also though only with the agreement of the commonwealth prime Ministers. Sir Roy Welensky would not however attend meetings at which constitutional questions e.g., relating to Nigeria were discussed.

Theymust also remember that the United Kingdom was only one among a number of equal partners of the Commonwealth. It could not order other commonwealth countries to follow the principles of liberty. It might be that as dependent countriesattained their independence some of them would turn to a authoritarian regime.Indeed, some might think that in the future we should have a totalitarian world.He himself could not believe that this would come about, and we must all fighton with patience and determination. He would devote what was left of his lifeto trying to steer the Commonwealth along those lines.
Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and the &quot; Pan-African Activists &quot;held at Flagstaff House, Accra on Saturday, 9th January, 1960, at 5 p.m.Dr. Nkrumah suggested that during his stay in Accra Mr. Macmillan should meet the Pan-African Activists so that he could &quot; see what he (Dr. Nkrumah) hadto put up with&quot;. Mr. Macmillan agreed to see them and a meeting atDr. Nkrumah&apos;s house was accordingly arranged. Amongst the organisationsrepresented were:The African Affairs Centre,The National Association of Students Socialist Organisation,The Ghana Trades Union Congress,The All-African People&apos;s Conference Secretariat.2. A list of those present is attached. Mr. Koinange of Kenya who had been invited was dissuaded by Mr. Dei-Anang from attending when it was made clearthat it would be embarrassing to Mr. Macmillan to meet him as there was a detention order outstanding against him in Kenya.3. Mr. Macmillan, who was accompanied by Mr. A. W. Snelling (HighCommissioner), Sir Norman Brook and some of the other members of his party,was introduced to those present and then sat down with about ten or fifteen ofthem who plied him with questions.   Dr. Nkrumah was not in the circle.4. The following are some of the questions that were asked and the repliesgiven by Mr. Macmillan:(a) Was not &quot; one man one vote &quot; a proper democratic procedure, and whydid we not grant this franchise, especially in Kenya and the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland?Mr. macmillan dealt with this question by pointing out how very-backward for the most part the indigenous people of the federation and Kenya were compared with the West Africans. He mentionedthose tribes who until well into his own life-time had not even inventedthe potter&apos;s wheel. It was a mistake to think that these people were as ready for democracy which was an advanced form of Government as were the people of Ghana or Nigeria. He asked if any of those present had ever seen Kenya or the Federation and none had.Secondly, he pointed out that, although &quot; one man one vote &quot; was an important feature of democracy as practised in Europe and north america, it was not by any means the only or most important feature.An equally important point was that in a democratic country theGovernment should show by its every word and deed that it considereditself to be in power only temporarily and that it was not in for good.He said that when asked for his address he always said his temporaryaddress was 10 Downing Street. The Pan-Africans took the point andno more was said on that topic.(b) Why should Sir Roy Welensky attend meetings of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters when the Rhodesian Federation had not attainedindependence, while Abubakar was not being invited though Nigeriawas on the eve of independence.Mr. Macmillan explained in detail the constitutional steps whichhad still to be taken before Nigeria became independent and empasisedthat the procedure would follow exactly that adopted in respect of malaya and Ghana. He said that the attendance of Sir Roy Welenskywas anomalous but followed the practice of some 20 years standingunder which Lord Malvern, as Prime Minister of what was then called the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia, had been invited asa courtesy and not as a right to attend these meetings. He said that,when the Federation was formed and Lord Malvern became its firstPrime Minister, it was natural to ask him to come as hitherto, and when sir Roy Welensky succeeded Lord Malvern invitations were extendedto him also though only with the agreement of the commonwealth prime Ministers. Sir Roy Welensky would not however attend meetings at which constitutional questions-e.g., relating to Nigeria were discussed.
(c) Fears were expressed that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland would become independent soon and that the United KingdomGovernment, according to their principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of independent members of the Commonwealth, wouldthen wash its hands of the Africans, particularly in Nyasaland andNorthern Rhodesia who would be left at the mercy of Sir Roy Welensky.Mr. Macmillan replied that there would be no question of theFederation becoming independent until the three constituent parts ofit agreed.  This seemed to satisfy the questioners.(d) Mr. Macmillan was asked about land tenure in Kenya.He explained that until the white men moved into the highlandsthere had been no African settlements there; the land had been used only by nomadic Masai who had roamed over it with their flocks.The highlands had been developed by white enterprise and now therestrictions were being removed which had hitherto prevented the saleof land to any buyer of whatever race.(e) Mr. Macmillan was asked if he would release Dr. Banda.He replied by quoting a statement of Dr. Nkrumah at a recentPress Conference in Accra to the effect that he disliked having to lockpeople up but that it was sometimes necessary to do so for the securityof the State.List of Persons Invited to Attend the Informal Pan-African RecertionGiven by Dr. Nkrumah for Mr. Macmillan on 9th January, 1960The Hon.

Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Krobo Edusei on Sunday,10th January, 1960, at 6 p.m.I talked to Mr. Edusei for an hour. I put to him some of the questions whichthe High Commissioner suggested.(a) Situation in Ashanti. He is going to spend ten days in Ashanti in chargeof the by-election. He is certain that the Government Party will win. He feels that he has a very strong following in Ashanti and that it is he and his friends whobrought Ashanti over to the C.C.P. Ashanti will not slide back. He describedat some length the customs, system of Chieftainship, &amp;c, of Ashanti. He regarded it as the right policy to preserve in an honorific and traditional way the power ofthe Chiefs, but to allow the democratic local government to grow up with the realpower gradually passing into their hands. The Chief acted as a President of theLocal Authority Council, but not as Chairman. He made an introductory speech and then retired. Chiefs are being paid large sums, one, he told me, as much as 16,000 a year. No doubt this is a move by which they have been kept on theGovernment side. It is exactly the move adopted by the English Government afterthe &apos;45. So it has quite good, authority. It was indeed followed after &apos;15, and tosome extent accounts for so many of the Chieftains remaining &quot; loyal&quot; or at least&quot; not coming out &quot; in the &apos;45.Mr. Edusei went on to say that the Ashanti was the most effective and vitalpeople and it was the core of the whole country.(b) As Minister of Transport and Communications he has placed large orderswith British firms and is very well satisfied with the result. According to his own account he travels round Europe and compares the different products. He gave a slightly different story about the bus contract from the one which Sir PatrickFitzgerland gave to me. According to him they bought 200 from Leylands and75 from a German firm. Although he had placed very heavy contracts with theBritish firms they really must be more active in coming out here. It was no goodwaiting in London. I said that I thought they had agents here and he admitted that this was true, but in many of the newer types of things they did not. He spokeabout the airfield, which was a British contract, a large G.E.C. contract, &amp;c. he went on to talk about Ghana Airways. He is trying to make a new contract with a.O.A.C., and it must be in a form that it will preserve &quot; the African personality &quot;.For this purpose it was important that the napkins and plates and knives shouldnot be marked &quot; B.O.A.C.&quot;. He was determined to get a contract with them on ayear-to-year basis or a long hire-purchase contract which made it clear that it wasa Ghana Airways and not a B.O.A.C. enterprise.(c) We went on to discuss the political situation. He was Joe Appiah&apos;s cousinand therefore he knew both sides. He said that Appiah and his friends hadbehaved in a terrible way, threatening the country with disorder. When the crisiscame Dr. Nkrumah had put him (Mr. Edusei) in charge of the situation. He went to Parliament, asked for emergency powers and shut up the men he thoughtdangerous. I said that emergency powers were necessary in certain circumstancesbut it was always the duty of a Government to give them up as soon as they could.We were often in the same predicament. He said he knew it well because he hadbeen imprisoned by the British Colonial Government. He knew what prison was.He said &quot; I have learnt it is one thing to agitate in Opposition; it is another thing to govern &quot;. I should very much doubt whether, if Mr. Edusei has anything to do with it, the emergency will be brought rapidly to an end.He went on to talk of political organisation. I gather that he is nowconcentrating on this. He had been in England during our General Election andlearned many lessons from it. He knew that the Conservatives would win. Theywere better organised. He placed great reliance on organisation. I did not ask him directly whether he wanted a one-party State but from what he said aboutthe elections, &amp;c, I think that he would at least wish to preserve the appearance of a more or less free system.(d) He began to talk himself about the Builders Brigade. He hoped to raiseit to 25,000. The plan was to take the boys, give them two years&apos; training, housethem, clothe them and, I think, feed them, and give them a small weekly allowance.They were concentrating on teaching the boys agriculture. After they had servedtheir two years they would be settled on farms along the frontiers of Ghana in theoutlying and newly-developing districts. They would grow vegetables not, I gather, cocoa.In summary, I found Mr. Edusei a very entertaining character. He told methat he owned a considerable cocoa farm, so I take it that he is well-to-do.
Note of a Visit by Mr. Harold Macmillan to the Chamber and Offices of theNational Assembly, Accra, on Monday, 11th January, 1960, at 11 30 a.m.Mr. Macmillan visited the Chamber and Offices of the National Assembly onthe morning of 11th January. He was received by the Speaker (Mr. Akiwumi) andmet a gathering of Members of Parliament at present in Accra, including the leader of the House, Mr. Botsio, other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, and anumber of back-benchers.Mr. Macmillan inspected the Chamber and Offices, and was photographedstanding by the Speakers Chair, which was a gift from the United kingdom parliament.In reply to a short speech of welcome by the Speaker in the CommonwealthParliamentary Association room, Mr. Macmillan said that he had been profoundlymoved to find in the Assembly so many reminders of the procedure with whichhe was familiar. Recalling the fact that he had first stood for Parliament 35 yearsago, and that of his first six elections he had won three and lost three, the PrimeMinister said that Parliament democracy was not an easy form of Governmentto work; one was apt to think when one was &quot; out&quot; that the people had lost their good sense, and only when one was &quot; in &quot; that they knew what they were about.Nevertheless, he himself believed that Parliamentary democracy had something tooffer which the more monolithic forms of Government could not match.Parliamentary democracy, with its ins and outs, its ups and downs, its recognitionof the right of Government to govern and of the Opposition to criticise, was, he believed, the system best adapted to give the people what they wanted. He believed,too, that inside Parliament there grew up, among members of all Parties, a sense of comradeship and of belonging to an institution that mattered. He wished the parliament and people of Ghana all good fortune.The proceedings ended with the gathering singing, at the invitation ofMr. Botsio, &quot; For he&apos;s a jolly good fellow &quot;, and rounds of cheers.MAIN POLICY SPEECHText of Speech Delivered by Mr. Macmillan at the State Banquet in Accra on saturday, 9th January, 1960I should like first to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, on behalf of my wife and myself for the kind words of welcome you have spoken. We are indeeddelighted to be here and to have a chance of seeing for ourselves some of the remarkable developments which have taken place in Ghana. I have knownDr. Nkrumah now for several years both as a colleague and, if I may say so, as a friend. He has given us the pleasure of entertaining him in England, both inLondon and in our own country home. The last time we met and talked was, Ithink, last August. It was then he visited The Queen at Balmoral, and receivedthe great and well-merited honour of being admitted to Her Majesty&apos;s privy council. And now, at last, I am able to pay a return visit and indeed we are happy to be with you all in Accra tonight.Of the British African territories moving towards self-government, Ghanawas the first to reach its goal. Your experiment in nation-building is therefore ofspecial interest to the people of Britain. We of course have been impressed, as haveother members of the Commonwealth, by the speed and efficiency with whichyour nation-State is progressing. We want you to know that you have the respect and friendship and all the good wishes from all the people in our country in yourgreat adventure. We in Britain, of course, were particularly delighted at thewarmth with which you welcomed His Royal Highness, Prince Philip, when hevisited Ghana a few weeks ago. And reading the enthusiastic accounts of the duke&apos;s visit in the British Press and seeing on our television and cinema screenssome of the great projects which he was shown in Ghana, we can well understand
why Prince Philip was impressed by two things which must impress every visitorto-day. First, the friendliness of your people that is the moral and spiritual side and secondly, the striking evidence of material progress on every side.We are all of us delighted, Sir, at the flourishing state of your economy. Well,economies don&apos;t always flourish sometimes it is quite difficult to steer themalong an even course. We have our troubles, no doubt you will have yours.But what strikes us here is the flourishing state of your economy and the prospects of further investment and development. There is, of course, a great demand allover the world for capital. That is what all the world wants. Capital is reallymade by the savings of people. It is made by a lot of people who forgo the claimsthey might make for themselves in order to put them at the disposal of others andthus postpone their own claims to the future. Capital will flow to those countries and to those projects where the projects are sound and where the countries attractinvestment by creating confidence in their political and economical stability.It is for that reason I am so sure that the strength of our connexion cannotonly be maintained but increased. We have a long relationship on the moral,physical, political side. We have great economic advantages that we can give eachother. We buy quite a lot of cocoa from you timber and minerals. And we look forward to buying a lot of Volta aluminium. We have been following with great interest the progress of the Volta River project. I know it figures very high inyour plans, Mr. Prime Minister, and those of your Government. I am glad to havebeen able to discuss with you some of the latest developments and to hear aboutthe negotiations which you are about to bring to a rapid conclusion. We shall certainly continue to watch these with sympathetic interest and, for my part, Iwould say that this sympathy and interest and enthusiasm will be reinforced byall that I have seen and heard here.As you may know, less than a year after I became Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom, I made a tour to four Commonwealth countries in Asia and alsoto Australia and New Zealand. I did this not to teach other people their business,but to see and to learn. To see something of the developments taking place in thesecountries and to learn from personal and intimate consultations with their PrimeMinisters and leading statesmen. I found it a profoundly moving experience tosee these great countries, some of them with immense populations added togetherthey form a great part of human society, with all their differences, creeds andbackgrounds, in race, in colour, in tradition and in history. That all should be equal and willing partners in a free association is something unique, I think, inthe history of the world. When great Empires have come and gone, this is something unique: a free association of independent nations, all contributors intheir own way to the whole.Two years ago for a number of reasons I could not finish my Commonwealthtour. So I made up my mind as soon as the British people, happily well advised,made it possible to finish my tour by seeing something of the commonwealth in Africa. I hope you will not mind my saying that we in Britain are proud or perhaps I should say grateful, that we have done something to help lay the foundations on which the people of Africa are building so confidently. We look forward to many years of helpful association.We realise, of course, the problems of this vast continent, with all its differences,greater than Europe and almost as great as Asia. We realise that Africa presentsa challenge a challenge calling for the best that all can offer. It is our duty tosee that the great changes taking place in Africa are carried through in such a way as to ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for all its inhabitants. We share the strong tide of feelings among all who live in Africa that it is a time of destiny.Your country which achieved its final independence less than three years ago is,of course, one of the most important independent countries of Africa. Your nearneighbour, Nigeria, will I trust become independent and will also I trust become an independent member of our Commonwealth later this year. But theseconstitutional advances are not confined to the countries with which we in Britainhave a particular association. The wind of change is blowing right through Africa.This rapid emergence of the countries of Africa gives the continent a newimportance in the world. One hundred years ago it would not be unfair to say,in spite of the many ancient cultures which have survived in certain regions, thecontinent as a whole played little part in world affairs. To-day it will have to playits full part in shaping the destinies of the world.
I was most grateful for the words the Prime Minister used about the part our country is trying to play and is determined to play in the vast problems that,confront this conflict of the idealisms of West and East. When I try to make some contribution it is not because I think that appeasement is the right answer. peace and justice must go together.In West Africa, where Europeans have come to work but not to make their homes, relations between Africans and Europeans have never been made difficult by any real conflict of interests. Indeed, they have learnt to live together, to work together and to play together in happiness and harmony. To-day they share thesame interests and the same pride in the growing importance of West Africa. the transition from dependent and then semi-independent and finally independent status has, broadly speaking, progressed smoothly, without disturbing the traditionalrelations between Africans and Europeans. Everywhere I go in Ghana I hear theslogan Freedom you have only now the task just as important as winning it-to preserve it through the years. But this absence of conflicts of interests betweenthe European and the African does not mean that you do not have some kindof similar problems as face other parts of the continent. After all, the countries of West Africa are inhabited by many people of different languages, religions and customs and these peoples have to live together in peace and friendship. And theindependent countries Ghana and soon Nigeria can give and, I believe, willgive a valuable example. At the same time, your own experience in nation-building will help you to understand some of the problems that exist elsewhere.In other parts of Africa, some of which I shall be visiting on my tour, theproblem of race relations is more difficult and complex than it is here in WestAfrica. Nonetheless in those countries too, the essential problem is one ofnation-building. It will be one of the main purposes of my visit to the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland to see and learn and, in all humility, seek how we inthe United Kingdom can best help. In our efforts to find the solution of theproblem to which you referred tonight and which I see, Mr. Prime Minister, you have referred to at other times, we shall hope to meet with sympathy and constructive help from our friends in other parts of Africa and in theCommonwealth at large.I recognise frankly that on every aspect of these difficult and baffling problemswe cannot always see eye to eye on every point. But as you have said and I amgrateful for it, Mr. Prime Minister in this difficult period of change anddevelopment the most important thing for us is to keep in touch, to exchange ideas,to make sure that we understand each other&apos;s point of view. For while we may allproperly question the soundness of another man&apos;s opinion, we should hesitatelightly to question his sincerity. That is true inside a single country it is indeed thevery basis of Parliamentary Government. It is still more true in external affairs.This business of getting to know each other&apos;s mind is one of the things I believeour Commonwealth association is best fitted to develop.In May of this year, we are having a meeting in London of all theCommonwealth Prime Ministers, now I think eleven in number. It will be a greathonour and pleasure to return, as far as we can, all the hospitality we have receivedfrom the Government of Ghana. And it will be a special benefit to me and all myfellow Prime Ministers to have, for the second time, the advantage and advice ofthe Prime Minister of Ghana. At the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; meeting in 1957, if I may say so, he was a new boy; this time he will be quite an old hand.He will be able to join in welcoming another member to our comradeship thePrime Minister of Malaya, a country where many of these problems exist withgreat pressure, where different races and different interests have to be weldedtogether to form a single country.Our Commonwealth association does not, of course, have the elaboratepermanent machinery of other associations such as the United Nations or thevarious Treaty Organisations. Our Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings are called at nofixed time, have no formal agenda, nor do they attempt to reach formal decisionsor conclusions. With us, I think it is the spirit that counts. We meet because weare associated, because we wish to remain associated, because we realise the valueof that association. And indeed, how valuable it is. Perhaps the very informalityof it the simplicity of it adds to its value in an age where everything is on the radio or on the -television. It isn&apos;t a bad thing for eleven soon to be twelve-Prime Ministers of such an immense divergence in the world to be. able to sit down
for four or five days and just talk quietly to each other about each other&apos;s affairs.To talk about the problems as they see them, knowing that every phrase hasn&apos;t tobe weighed because it will be the subject of some criticism. And, indeed, howvaluable it is to have in this Cabinet of the Commonwealth, representatives now ofthe African States. I speak not only of the value to the United Kingdom, but fromthe point of view of a statesman, let us say, in Delhi, Canberra or Ottawa. Howextraordinary it is, that we have in every continent and all round the globe,Commonwealth representatives bound, not by legal or constitutional ties but by what I can only call this almost mystical link.I sincerely hope that given the goodwill characteristic of this Commonwealthtradition, we that is everyone who has responsibilities in Africa will be able toarrive at solutions for our joint and several problems. For if we cannot co-operate,if we divide into separate camps, shouting slogans at each other, we may all suffergrievous harm and most of all those in all the countries for whom we areresponsible and for whom we are trustees. What we have to do, in my view, is totake every situation as objectively as we can, and to work our way to the bestanswers that circumstances permit.It is because I sincerely believe in the broad principles which I know we sharetogether and on which we must base our attempts to resolve the many acutepolitical problems that face us to-day, that I set out upon this journey. I am heretonight at the beginning and I am very glad and, indeed, proud to be allowed to start it here, where you are making this great experiment and where you lead theway. I hope that at the end of my journey I will have learnt something at any ratefrom that most eloquent of all teachers practical experience. I believe, Sir, that onthat road to co-operation and peaceful development the outstanding part can be played and must be played by the Commonwealth. Mr. Prime Minister, and your Excellency, I would like once more to say to you all how grateful I am for.this great opportunity. I am proud to feel that we are members of this family and,like the Prime Minister who has proposed this toast, I pray that as the years passour group of nations, actuated by high principles taking all that is best of thepast will build together for the future, and work together for the peace and progress of mankind.DESPATCH FROM UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER INGHANA TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR COMMONWEALTHRELATIONSI have the honour to submit a report upon the visit of Mr. Macmillan to Ghanabetween the 6th and the 11th January. This was the first stage of the PrimeMinister^ African tour, in which he is also visiting Nigeria, the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland and Southern Africa. Incidentally, it was the firstvisit ever paid to Africa South of the Sahara by a Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom while in office. Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Lady DorothyMacmillan and a party of officials, including Sir Norman Brook, Mr. Harold Evansand Mr. D. W. S. Hunt.2. When he arrived in Accra, the Prime Minister said he had come &quot; to seeand to learn &quot;. For this purpose he was inevitably taken to the Volta River ProjectDam site at Akosombo and the,now nearly completed new harbour at Tema, withthe adjacent township and industrial development area. He visited AchimotaSchool, the nursery of many of Ghana&apos;s most prominent politicians and officials,and the still growing University College of Ghana. He saw the Second development plan Exhibition, which Dr. Nkrumah had kept open especially for him. He visited the National Assembly where, although the Assembly was not in session, he meta large gathering of Ministers and back-benchers and saw the Speakers Chair,presented to the Assembly last year by the House of Commons. He held a press conference. He attended a State reception for 500 guests, and a party at whichhe met and gave a short address to the leading members of the United Kingdomcommunity resident in Ghana.   After a little difficulty with Dr. Nkrumah, theMy Lord,Accra, 20th January, 1960.
Prime Minister also had an hour&apos;s private talk with four of the leaders of theOpposition. He went to a party given by Dr. Nkrumah to meet some of the&quot; Pan-African Activists &quot;, including officials of the Convention Peoples&apos; Party,the Ghana Trades Union Congress, the All-African People&apos;s Conference and other organisations. Meanwhile Lady Dorothy Macmillan saw and was photographedat a number of welfare and other institutions in this town. By way of more informalrelaxation, the Prime Minister visited Accra Harbour, where he saw cargo beingdischarged from ships by the surfboats, which will disappear when Tema Harbourcomes into full operation, and himself went to sea and happily came back again in one of these primitive craft. He also visited the Accra Market, where thefamous mammies, though doubtless ignorant of Sir Walter Raleigh, laid downunessential parts of their voluminous wrappings for their distinguished visitor towalk upon.3. Records of Mr. Macmillan&apos;s discussions with Dr. Nkrumah and otherGhanaians are already available to your Lordship. The main topic was naturallypolitical developments in Africa, and particularly in the multi-racial territories of concern to us on its eastern side. Dr. Nkrumah spoke in private with greatmoderation, recognising that there was no difference in objectives between ghana and the United Kingdom Governments but only on means and on speed. he brought up again the idea which he mentioned when your Lordship was in Accralast year of seeking to avoid disagreement between the two Governments overAfrican nationalism by drawing up a charter of principles to which both of them could subscribe. He produced a draft of his own, setting out Ghana&apos;s point of view.It is an interesting document, and although we could not subscribe to it as it stands,it is by no means so unacceptable as might have been expected.4. The Prime Minister explained to Dr. Nkrumah that he could not commit himself to such a declaration of broad principles at the beginning of a tour designedto acquaint himself at first hand with some of the problems of the Continent.The Ghanaian draft was accordingly left for subsequent study. Mr. Macmillangave an eloquent and persuasive account of our Colonial problem in Africa.Broadly, in those parts of Africa, including West Africa, where the populationswere homogeneous there was agreement that we were following the right policy at more or less the right speed. But in East and Central Africa the situation was complicated, first because the indigenous peoples were more backward than in theWest, and second because of the existence of long-established Asiatic and Europeanminorities. There, the only just solution compatible with economic progress seemedto be one based on a multi-racial society. Hence our difficult search for means bywhich the various communities could be enabled to live peacefully together. west african countries could help, both by impressing on African opinion in theFederation the need for patience and by setting an example of tolerance andco-operation.5. The outcome of the talks on other topics between the two Prime Ministerscan be summarised as follows:(a) Volta. Dr. Nkrumah was not very lucid, but it was clear that he was notyet asking the United Kingdom Government to make a contribution towards the cost of the dam and power plant. It was left that further discussions would take place, probably in London at the time ofthe meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, after further progress had been made with the aluminium companies and after an international bank Mission had reported.(b) Republic. Dr. Nkrumah showed himself anxious to proceed with duepropriety. A republican constitution is still being drafted. Once ithas been published it will be debated in Parliament and put to a referendum. Thereafter, the agreement of other Commonwealth PrimeMinisters will be sought in May to a republican Ghana remaining inthe Commonwealth, and consequential legislation will be necessary inthe United Kingdom in time to permit the inauguration of the republic.  by the first week in July.(c) Commonwealth Questions. Dr. Nkrumah was troubled because, althoughthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is not a fully independentmember of the Commonwealth, Sir Roy Welensky is invited to attend meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. The Prime Ministeradmitted this practice to be anomalous, but explained that it had
grown up principally because Lord Malvern had attended the meetingsas Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia for many years, and hadnaturally been invited when he subsequently became Prime Ministerof the Federation. Dr. Nkrumah was also disturbed about the relationship which Cyprus would have with the Commonwealth, andthe Prime Minister explained the current uncertainties to him. It seems likely that more will be heard from Dr. Nkrumah on both these topics,for in his anxiety to secure from his ill-informed followers support for Ghana to remain in the Commonwealth after she becomes a republic,he needs to be able to demonstrate to them that the Commonwealthreally is an organisation of fully independent States. Anything blurredabout the edges is an embarrassment to him. He threw out the suggestionthat the term &quot; Commonwealth &quot; should in future be restricted to theassociation of independent members.In a talk by themselves the two Prime Ministers also discussed the proper role ofan Opposition, Kenyatta, Banda, Sekou Toure, violence and East-West relations.6. The reception of the Prime Minister by the general populace was warmand friendly. Some of the visiting Pressmen thought otherwise at first mainly because there were no crowds to witness the journey on first arrival from the airportto the Governor-General!s Lodge. But the Ghanaian authorities had organiseda processional drive through the centre of Accra later in the programme, and onthis occasion the Prime Minister and Dr. Nkrumah, sitting in the back of an open car, had a tumultuous reception from crowds lining the route for about miles. And when passing through villages on the way back from Akosombo,the Prime Minister was greeted with school-children, singing, flag-waving andgeneral jollification which he said reminded him of an election tour. At no time was the Prime Minister faced with slogans or placards about Dr. Banda, the Frenchatomic tests or other delicate topics such as awaited him in Nigeria.7. Press reactions to the visit were mixed. The sincerity and goodwill ofthe Prime Minister struck an answering chord, and the local newspapers reportedhim respectfully and fairly. The only act or statement of the Prime Minister inAccra on which the hostile editors of the pro-Government newspapers could seizewas his remark at his Press conference that the French atomic test in the Saharawould have no effect from the health point of view, and they did their worst withthat. But throughout the visit the leading articles in the pro-Government Press,couched in their customary language of 18th century vituperation, were in full cryagainst our &quot; Colonial errors &quot;. The daily dose of anti-British poison in thosenewspapers which are the voice of the ruling political Party is a disquieting feature of life in Ghana, and the Prime Minister would not have gained a true impression ofthe country if it had been withheld for the occasion.8. A summing up of the effects of the visit of the Prime Minister to Ghana,both from our point of view and from that of the Ghanaians, can be undertakenonly as part of an assessment of the results of his African tour as a whole.Economically, Mr. Macmillan could not fail to be impressed by the way in which,to judge by Ghana, independence is followed by a rapid acceleration in the rateof development. Politically, except for the useful discussion of one or two topicsmainly of local significance, one of the valuable results of the Prime Ministers briefstay in Accra was to enable him to hear, and Dr. Nkrumah and his followers totell him, the point of view of Ghana upon the tide of Black nationalism whichis sweeping Africa and upon the problems of the multi-racial territories in theeastern and southern parts of this Continent, some of which he had yet to visit.Mr. Macmillan for his part succeeded in demonstrating to all Ghanaians he metthat the United Kingdom Government is attacking the problems of Africa in a friendly and realistic way, with due regard to African views. The visit has undoubtedly made a very considerable contribution towards the objective illustrated by the Prime Minister in his speech at the State Dinner, when he said: &quot; The mostimportant thing for us is to keep in touch, to exchange ideas, to make sure thatwe understand each other&apos;s point of view. For while we may properly question the soundness of another man&apos;s opinion, we should hesitate lightly to condemn hissincerity &quot;.I have, &amp;c.A. W. SNELLING.
PART IIINIGERIACOMMENTARYThe welcome accorded to the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillanon their drive from Ikeja Airport into Lagos was a foretaste of the reception thatawaited them throughout Nigeria. This was a journey of more than 10 miles,and quite a large number of people had assembled at intervals throughout the route; but in the city of Lagos itself the crowds were dense and demonstrative. Thecontrast with Ghana was noticeable. There, the spirit was one of friendly interest.In Lagos there was more warmth and enthusiasm, and more evidence of a particularattachment to the United Kingdom. This seemed to be an essentially Britishoccasion.The same spirit informed the official discussions which the Prime Minister held with Nigerian Ministers, both in Lagos and in the three Regional capitals. no opportunity was lost to express the gratitude of the Nigerian people for the help which they had received from the United Kingdom in the past. And the hopewas often expressed that this association, though changed in form, would in substance continue in the future. Nigerians look forward with satisfaction to theircoming independence and are anxious to be admitted to full membership of theCommonwealth. But their Ministers, at any rate, would evidently like to feel that within that circle they will still retain some special association with the UnitedKingdom.This may be partly due to the realisation that, although they are about to achieve their political independence, it will be a long time before they are ableto meet all their requirements from their own resources. Like all newly-independent countries, they are preoccupied with the need for economic development andconscious that it cannot be satisfied without substantial investment from overseas.They view with misgiving the approaching end of grants from Colonial development and Welfare funds and the other forms of financial assistance extended to themin Colonial days; and they are anxious that this measure of assistance should becontinued, even though it may flow in future through different channels. Bothin Lagos and in the Regional capitals the Prime Minister was repeatedly told thatNigeria would greatly prefer that investment from overseas should continue to bedrawn from the United Kingdom than from any other source.Nigerian Ministers also admitted that they will need, not only money, butmen both administrators and technicians of various kinds. They are conscious that they will have to continue to rely on outside assistance for some time tocome, until they have trained more of their own people to undertake these duties.Here too they are grateful for the help they have had from the United Kingdom inthe past: and in principle there is no reluctance to contemplate the continuanceof expatriate officers in Nigerian service after independence.Defence was another matter on which Nigerian Ministers looked for continuinghelp from the United Kingdom. They are concerned about the defence of theirfrontiers. They fear that, with the disintegration of the French Colonial empire in Africa, maladministration and unrest beyond their borders may reach a point at which their territorial integrity is threatened. They are especially concerned at the situation which may develop in the French Cameroons. They recognisethat, if this position deteriorates, they may be unable without help to deal with itsconsequences within their own territory; and they are anxious to be assured thatin this event they could count on military assistance from the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister was greatly impressed by the wise and authoritativeinfluence exercised in all these matters by the Governor-General, Sir JamesRobertson. He was glad to learn that the Nigerian Government are likely, after independence, to ask that Sir James should continue in this office for a time.But he was impressed by the importance and the difficulty of ensuring thatafter independence the United Kingdom representatives throughout Nigeria willbe men who have the character and the experience to enable them to give the help and guidance required by a country which, though it has achieved its political independence, will not for some time be able to stand firmly on its own feet.
Politically, Nigeria&apos;s immediate problem is to make a success of the federalsystem and to weld the different races of the three Regions into a single national unity. The Prime Minister had an opportunity of judging the practical difficultiesof this problem in the brief visits which he paid to each of the three Regions.The differences of race, temperament, climate and way of life -were readilyapparent, and the spirit of rivalry between the Regions was also evident. But thefederal system has survived its initial period of trial; and its machinery, althoughit creaks in places, is working reasonably well. The Prime Minister was assured that the younger men, especially among the educated classes, are beginning to think of themselves as Nigerians rather than Ibos, Yorubas or Hausas.The Prime Minister would not have gained a true impression of the variety of the Nigerian scene if he had not visited the three Regional capitals as well asLagos. These visits added greatly to the strain of his journey, especially as he was able to devote only one day each to Ibadan and Enugu and only two to Kaduna.But there is no doubt that, if he had not gone to each of the Regions, the valueof his visit would have been greatly reduced. And the visit to the Northern Regiondid at least give him one day of respite from official business, when the Sardaunaof Sokoto took him to see the Emir of Zaria. This was a day of burning sunshine,free from the exhausting humidity of the south: and he was treated to a colourfuldisplay of horsemanship in Muslim surroundings reminiscent more of Moroccoor Pakistan than of West Africa. In many ways this was the most memorableday of his Nigerian visit.For the present, Nigerian Ministers are preoccupied with their own domesticproblems and are showing correspondingly less interest in political developmentselsewhere in Africa. The Prime Minister was not therefore embarrassed, as hehad been in Ghana, with insistent advice about the pace of constitutional advance in other African territories. Nor was he under pressure to receive deputationsfrom representatives of political organisations concerned to advance the politicalcause of Africans in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland or in the Unionof South Africa. Enough was said, however, by Federal Ministers to make it plain that there is no love lost between them and Dr. Nkrumah. An independent Nigeriawill be jealous of Ghana&apos;s leadership in this part of Africa. And, if it can soonachieve political unity and strength, Nigeria may well be able to exercise arestraining influence on any exaggerated nationalism which may develop in ghana and in other neighbouring territories in West Africa.

RECORDS OF MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONSRecord of Conversation between Mr. Macmillan and the Prime Minister of theFederation of Nigeria at Government House, Lagos, on Tuesday, 12th January,1960, at 9 30 a.m.1. Constitutional QuestionsAlhaji Abubakar said that on 14th January the Federal Parliament would passa resolution authorising the Government to seek independence from 1st October,1960, and to seek thereafter to remain within the Commonwealth as a full member.This resolution, if approved, would be forwarded to the United KingdomGovernment.Mr. Macmillan said that he wondered whether it was enough that theexpression of Nigeria&apos;s desire to remain within the Commonwealth should rest ona resolution passed before the country had formally become independent.Ill-natured people might say that this resolution, passed while Nigeria was stilldependent on the United Kingdom, was not the expression of the unfettered will of a free Nigerian people. The resolution to be passed on 14th January could betaken as a basis for the consultations which the United Kingdom Governmentwould hold with other Commonwealth Governments with a view to reaching adecision, at the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in May, that Nigeriawould be admitted to full Commonwealth membership on attaining independence.It might, however, be desirable that, in addition, the Nigerian Cabinet should,immediately after independence, say on 2nd October, make a formal applicationfor Commonwealth membership. Mr. Macmillan undertook to consider this pointof procedure in consultation with his colleagues and to arrange for further advice to be given on it.Mr. Macmilian said that it was convenient that Alhaji Abubakar was to bein London in May, at the time of the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.This would enable him to meet some of the other Prime Ministers. He might alsobe included in some of the informal discussions which would be taking place at thattime.2.   Internal QuestionsAlhaji Abubakar said that there were many immediate problems confrontingNigeria. It was a large country, comprising different peoples and different tribalgroups. Considerable bitterness had been aroused during the election campaign.He now had to work hard to nurse the country into a sense of national unity.All the main Parties had fought the election on a basis that, although theywere regional Parties, they had the national interest at heart. The Action group had made some ground in the Eastern Region by exploiting inter-tribal differencesand had also gained ground in the North, where they had exploited religiousdifferences between Moslems and non-Moslems.Alhaji Abubakar said that he would have liked to treat the first period ofNigerian independence as an emergency period calling for a national Government.Unfortunately the Action Group had proved themselves to be very difficult partnerswhen sharing the responsibilities of Government in the past and they would not join a coalition, although they had made approaches to him after the electionresults were known on the basis of forming an alliance with the N.P.C. They had also tried to form a coalition with the N.C.N.C. He himself had thought it important that the largest Party resulting from the first General Election shouldtake the responsibility of forming a Government. He had therefore brought about an agreement between the N.P.C. and the N.C.N.C. on the basis that Dr. Azikiweshould become President of the Senate and be in due course a candidate for thepost of Governor-General. It must be remembered that N.C.N.C. was not an easy Party and Dr. Azikiwe was a difficult man to work with. He had made it quite clear that the coalition would come to an end if there were attempts to undermine his own position.Mr. Macmillan said that the first task was to build the new Nigerian Stateinto a single unit. He asked what Alhaji Abubakar had in mind about a changein the Governor-Generalship.   Alhaji Abubakar said that it might be a mistake
to make too early a change. Though he had not yet finally made up his mind, he hadbeen considering the possibility of asking Sir James Robertson to stay on for atleast a year: he had been a very good friend to Nigeria.3.   External Affairs(a) Alhaji Abubakar said that he was not very happy about his neighbours,which were now becoming independent. He had long, open frontiers which werenecessarily unprotected. He did not have very large military forces and mighthave considerable difficulty in maintaining the security of the country. Hiscolleagues had particularly asked him to take up the question whether the UnitedKingdom would come to the aid of Nigeria if there were a threat from outside.He had told them that this would not be easy after independence, but he wanted the United Kingdom Prime Minister to know about it.Mr. Macmillan said that he would consider this request in consultation withhis colleagues in London. It seemed to him that there were two problems:(i) what assistance the United Kingdom could give in helping the Nigeriansto organise their defence forces, perhaps by training, supply of arms,&amp;c.; and(ii) what help could be given by the United Kingdom, perhaps by way of atreaty, to protect the territorial integrity of Nigeria after independence.(b) Alhaji Abubakar said that he had recently been in Liberia for the anniversary of their independence. He was unhappy about the situation there.He thought that Liberia, like Guinea, was playing into the hands of the communists. Its Government, despite its past relations with the United States,did not now appear to be very friendly to them; it had, for example, given theBritish Minister of State a higher place than Mr. Cabot Lodge at the recentcelebrations.(c) Alhaji Abubakar spoke at some length about the attempts which the Israelies were making to extend their influence in West Africa. He had seen the israeli Foreign Secretary when in Liberia and had told her that there were strongrumours circulating in Nigeria that the Israeli Government had given money tothe Action Group to help them in the election campaign. She had said that therewere many people who were ready to spread false rumours about Israel. she had asked about the appointment of an Israeli Consulate in Nigeria and he had told her that this application could be renewed after independence. He had been concerned to learn the previous day that the Eastern Region had invited her to visit Nigeria. He had put his foot down on this as external affairs was a Federalresponsibility.(d) Alhaji Abubakar said that Ghana was likely to cause difficulties in WestAfrica. It seemed to attract all the extremists. The Soviet Government were alsotrying hard to influence it.Mr. Macmillan said that it would be easy to over-estimate this danger.Independence might have gone to their heads, but they would probably steadydown when other larger countries in West Africa had achieved independence.(e) Alhaji Abubakar referred to trouble in the French Cameroons and inparticular to the movement of refugees into the British Cameroons and intoNigeria. The Nigerian Government had decided that these people must bedeported to somewhere other than the French Cameroons. They had thereforesent them to the Sudan. Egypt had then taken up the case and had treated thematter as if the people had been deported from Nigeria. This was quite misleading.(/) Alhaji Abubakar said that there was some trouble in Dahomey and alsoin Togoland, which was due to become independent on 27th April. AlhajiAbubakar was particularly sorry that Dr. Nkrumah should have said in parliament in Ghana that Togoland would become the seventh province of Ghana. this statement had been made without any prior consultation with the Togolandauthorities.Mr. Macmillan said that he hoped that the Governments in West Africa would try to avoid unilateral territorial expansion.(g) Finally, Alhaji Abubakar referred briefly to the Nigerian foreignintelligence service and said that he was expecting someone from the UnitedKingdom to help with this.

Sir Norman Brook,Secretary of the Cabinet, UnitedKingdomSecretaries:Mr. A. F. F. P. NewnsMr. M. JenkinsMallam abdul rahman HoweidyDiscussions with the Prime Minister of the United KingdomThe President entered the Council Chamber accompanied by the Right Hon.Harold Macmillan, M.P., Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and by theRight Hon. Sir Norman Brook, Secretary of the United Kingdom Cabinet. ThePresident introduced Mr. Macmillan to the Council and then left the Chamber.Mr. Macmillan said that it was a very great honour to be invited to meet theCouncil at its first meeting in its present form. He said that, with the PrimeMinisters permission, he had brought with him Sir Norman Brook, who was notonly Head of the Cabinet secretariat in the United Kingdom, but also Head of theUnited Kingdom Civil Service; he was a man of long experience in cabinet government who had served a number of Governments.Mr. Macmillan said that he felt great emotion at being present in that room on such an important date. The Ministers who were present and generations tocome would look back to the year 1960 as a great year in the history of Nigeria.He referred to the satisfaction of the British people at the thought that the longassociation between Great Britain and Nigeria had resulted in the successfullaunching of this great experiment. That association had begun in liberty becauseone of the objects of the arrival of the British in the West Coast of Africa wasto achieve liberty and now a new form of liberty, freedom and independencewas developing. A great responsibility rested with the Nigerian Ministers for thefuture freedom and happiness of the people of a very large territory.
The system of government in Nigeria differed in some respects from thesystem in the United Kingdom, as Nigeria had a federal constitution, but therewere already members of the Commonwealth, Australia and Canada, that had gained experience in the working of federal constitutions, and their experiencemight be of value to Nigeria. A federal constitution presented difficulties but ithad also many advantages. He thought that to anyone who knew something aboutNigeria the choice of a federal constitution was the right and only one, but withRegional Governments and Legislatures responsible for the matters within theirown fields of competence, a great duty was imposed upon the Federal Cabinet to foster the unity of the country.He referred to the difficulties that had come upon other countries by a lackof cohesion within their Parliaments or Cabinets which had resulted in a breakdown of Parliamentary government. For Parliamentary government to be successful,there must be loyalty to the system. One of the most important aspects of theBritish concept of Parliamentary government was that of Cabinet responsibility.In a Cabinet composed of Ministers of one Party, there would inevitably bedifferences of opinion; the differences would perhaps be greater when the cabinet was a coalition. Ministers should be free to voice their differences in discussion in the Cabinet, but once a conclusion had been reached, then all members of theGovernment should stand by that decision and present a united front to thecountry. The Press and others would try to find and exploit differences between ministers and so they should always be on their guard. Long experience in theUnited Kingdom had shown the value of this principle of collective responsibility.Mr. Macmillan said that from the time of Walpole to 1916, no records were kept of Cabinet proceedings in the United Kingdom, and there was no cabinet secretariat. However, that caused many difficulties because of the uncertaintysurrounding the decisions taken by the Cabinet. It was the function of a cabinet secretariat to serve the Cabinet as a whole; the loyalty of the secretariat was tothe Cabinet and not to individual Ministers. Experience over the last 30 or 40years had shown the great advantage of an efficient Cabinet secretariat. It was most important that the decisions reached by the Cabinet should be clearlyrecorded and when conclusions were distributed, the Ministers, should they disagreewith any aspect, should say so immediately or otherwise forever after hold their peace.He said that the future of Nigeria would depend very largely on the first yearsof its life as an independent country. Independent Nigeria would be launched on1st October; it would set sail with a good captain and its future success would depend on loyal officers and a loyal crew. Mr. Macmillan concluded by sayingthat on behalf of his Cabinet colleagues and of all the people of the United Kingdomhe wished the Council of Ministers every possible success in its task. He prayedthat, under God&apos;s guidance, they would succeed in bringing the country forward to a great new era in the life of the people.The Prime Minister of the Federation said that it was a great day for them;it was the first time that a British Prime Minister had attended their Cabinet office.He was grateful for the fine words said about Nigeria and about its future. Hewas grateful to the British Government for the help given to Nigeria over manyyears, and in particular to the Government of which Mr. Macmillan was now thehead for their sympathetic consideration of the desires and needs of the people ofthe Federation. He was very happy to know of the goodwill of the people of theUnited Kingdom, particularly with the difficult time there would be ahead of nigeria in the running of its federal constitution. It would be the aim of theFederal Government to achieve national unity. That could not be done in ashort time; it would be a process over a number of years, but he felt sure that as time went on there would be understanding and co-operation between all theGovernments in the country.In a general discussion which followed, The Minister of Finance raised two points, both of which he said were fundamental to the continued existence of nigeria:(a) Nigeria was grateful to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for theassistance he gave towards the granting of the  15 million loan without which Nigeria could not have completed her development programme.Nigeria was a big country with a large population but also with manyresources.  It was the duty of the Federal Government to develop the
resources of the country for the future prosperity of the people. Theywere very appreciative of the Colonial Development and Welfare grants which had been made in the past, and he hoped that as Nigeria moved from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth Relations Office theUnited Kingdom Government would view with sympathy Nigeria&apos;sneeds for capital assistance.(b) The position of Nigeria in Africa was very significant; the country would wish in the future to contribute to the general defence of theCommonwealth but Nigeria was not sufficiently strong to play a bigpart in that way. With the coming of independence they would not feelas safe as in the past. The frontiers of Nigeria were so wide and therewas a risk of trouble on her borders. The subject had been discussed in the Defence Council and they were concerned about the future position.Mr. Macmillan said that he would bear in mind the reference of the Ministerof Finance to the future loan needs. As regards defence, he said that it was hopedthat a Defence Agreement would be formally concluded after discussions with theUnited Kingdom Government at the end of the spring. Quite apart from anywritten word, what was most important was the spirit behind any such agreement.As regards defence generally, he said there were two types of problem:(c) The risk of a general world conflict.  The danger of that, he hoped, wasreceding; it was a matter to which he had referred in his speech on theprevious evening.(d) The more local danger of the breakdown of law and order in neighbouring territories, and infiltrations, revolutionary activities andsubversive revolutionary movements. He agreed that there was a need to guard against such troubles. Until the 1st October, the defence of nigeria was the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government,and the question was how best the United Kingdom Government andthe Federal Government could co-operate to solve the problem afterthe 1st October. He was glad that the subject had been raised and said that careful study would be given to the problem against the timewhen there were discussions in London on the subject.The Minister of Transport and Aviation said that Ministers responsible forpolicy making in the United Kingdom had had long experience of civil servantsexecuting policy; he asked for some guidance on the relationship between theCabinet secretariat and civil servants in Ministries. Mr. Macmillan said that theCabinet made policy decisions, and the Minister concerned was then responsiblefor carrying out the decisions with the aid of the civil servants in his Ministry.There were occasions when the Prime Minister might leave a certain matter to a minister to execute but would wish to be kept informed of progress, and then he might ask the Secretary of the Cabinet to obtain a progress report.Sir Norman Brook added that in many matters policy was not covered by the responsibilities of a single Minister; there were many problems which touchedmore than one Department. It was in such matters that the Cabinet secretariatcould provide the co-ordination required through the committee organisation.The Cabinet secretariat provided services for committees at all levels. He made afurther point: as the Secretary of the Cabinet was present at all Cabinet meetingshe was aware of the views of Ministers, and the points on which conflict of interest might arise. He was therefore able to assist in enlisting the co-operation of officials of the Departments concerned in carrying out the intentions of the Cabinet.In answer to an enquiry from The Minister of Mines and Power about the relationship of Members of the Cabinet to the House of Lords and the House ofCommons, Mr. Macmillan said that there were Members of both Houses in theCabinet but, unlike the arrangement in the Nigerian Constitution, a Member of theHouse of Lords could not sit or speak in the House of Commons and vice versa.Over the years a convenient arrangement had grown up whereby certain ministers were appointed without portfolios for example, the Lord Privy Seal, the paymaster-General and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. None of these offices carried any Departmental function, and it was very convenient to be ableto assign special duties to their holders. Thus, the Lord Privy Seal had recentlybeen made responsible for Science.
In reply to an enquiry from Mr. Macmillan, the Minister of Finance described the system of revenue allocation which had been established following the RaismanCommission. He said that the Federal Government collected export duty onproduce and paid it all to the Region of origin. Royalties on oil and other mineralswere collected by the Federal Government and were paid out as follows: 50 percent, to the Region of origin, 30 per cent, to a distributable pool, and 20 per cent,to the Federal Government. The money in the distributable pool was sharedbetween the Federal Government and all Regional Governments. The Ministerof Works and Surveys referred to the many mineral and other resources which hadnot been tapped, and of which the best advantage was not being taken. he emphasised the importance of transport in developing the country. He mentionedColonial Development and Welfare grants, and hoped that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would bear in mind Nigeria&apos;s need for the development of her road system and asked if there could be some scheme for grants for road construction.Mr. Macmillan said that that raised the general question whether there might beassistance, either by a loan or a grant. Consideration would be given to the matterbut he wished to make no commitment without being able to consult his ownMinister of Finance, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Communications mentioned the need for the training of technical staff and said that Nigeria needed aid in the development of its technical colleges and in the establishment of night schools.In conclusion, the Prime Minister thanked Mr. Macmillan for visiting theCouncil in the Council Chamber. Mr. Macmillan said that he felt it to be a verygreat honour to have received the invitation to do so; he would not forget the dayas long as he lived.The Council adjourned at 11 - 30 a.m.Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and the Leaders of the opposition in the Nigerian Federal Parliament held at Government House, Lagos, onWednesday, 13th January, 1960, at 11 45 a.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Mr. T. J. Bligh.The Leader of the Opposition, Chief Awolowo, was accompanied byMr. Ayo Rosiji, Chief Anthony Enahqro, Mr. Briggs (Eastern Region) andMr. Tarka (Northern Region).After an exchange of courtesies Chief Awolowo said that the Nigerian election campaign had lasted too long. It had in effect started after the second london conference. He thought that in the future they should try to make their electioncampaigns shorter, although in view of the distances to be travelled they couldnot be as short as in the United Kingdom.Mr. Macmillan asked what were the main points at issue in the election. no reply emerged to this question.Mr. Macmillan then asked what was the strength of the Action Group Partyin the country. Chief Awolowo said that their total strength in the House was 73(two of their members had crossed the Floor since the election results had been announced). Of these, 24 came from the north, 34 from the west, 14 from theeast and 1 from Lagos.Mr. Macmillan asked what was the best time of the year for elections in nigeria. Chief Awolowo said that the weather was best between november and May.Mr. Macmillan asked what would be the main issues arising in the debate onthe Address. Chief Awolowo said that the debate would &quot; roam around the field &quot;,The House would then adjourn until the Budget.The Leaders of the Opposition all paid tribute to Sir Frederic Metcalfe(Speaker, House of Representatives). Their main line in the debate on the Addresswould be to say that the Government should have put a few proposals, howeversmall, in The Queen&apos;s Speech.   In reply to further questions from the PrimeSECRET56647 G
Minister on the main issues between the Parties, Chief Awolowo said that theAction Group stood for the creation of more States, as there were some minoritiesin the Eastern and Western Regions.The general feeling amongst the Opposition leaders seemed to be that theAction Group was more radical than the other Parties.Chief Awolowo said that, it was very important that communications shouldbe opened up in Nigeria. For example, the main wealth of the north lay in cattle,but they lost a lot of value in the drive down to the south,,which at present relied on fish as its main source of protein.In the election, the main instrument of persuasion had been the public meeting,with the usual accompaniments. In most constituencies there were three or fourcandidates but there was no question of a transferable vote. Mr. Macmillanreferred to the problems of a federal system, with reference to Australia and canada, and quoted the French in Quebec as a good example of a protectedminority. It must be satisfying to the Nigerian Government to know that similar problems to those with which they would be confronted had been solved in the past.The meeting closed with a further exchange of courtesies.Record of a Conversation between Mr. Macmillan and the Premier of theSouthern Cameroons held at Government House, Lagos, on Wednesday,13th January, 1960, at 12 30 p.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by the Governor-General and Sir NormanBrook.The Premier of the Southern Cameroons, Mr. J. N. Foncha, was accompaniedby the Commissioner, Mr. Field.Mr. Foncha said that he was sorry that Mr. Macmillan had not been able tofind time to pay a personal visit to the Southern Cameroons. This being so, hehad made a special journey to Lagos, so that he might have the opportunity of meeting him there.In reply to questions by Mr. Macmillan, Mr. Foncha first gave some factual information about the constitution, population and economics of the southern Cameroons. Mr. Macmillan then turned to the problems involved in administering the territory during the interim period from 1st October, when Nigeria wouldbecome independent, to the date when the United Nations would reach a finaldecision on its future in the light of the plebiscite which was to be held before march 1961. He asked whether the existing Government in the southern Cameroons were confident that they would be able to handle that situation.Mr. Foncha said that it would be some months before the plebiscite was held and he hoped in that period to get some constitutional experts to help him.Mr. Macmillan said that this would be good. But he was rather more concerned about the stability of the Administration during this difficult period.There seemed to him to be two needs: first, the Government must be ready toencourage existing administrators to stay and, secondly, the officers themselvesmust be willing to remain, for they could not be compelled to do so. Wouldthese two needs be met?Sir James Robertson said that Mr. Field, with assistance from the federal government of Nigeria, was now carrying out a survey of the existing staff tosee who would be willing to remain. Some of the public services (e.g., Posts and customs) were run on a federal basis and these consisted largely of Nigerian andexpatriate officers. The regional service contained a larger proportion of local officers. Mr. Field said that even in those services very few of the senior posts were held by local officers; and, in some of them (e.g., health services) a high proportionof the specialists were Nigerians or expatriates.Mr. Foncha then made a prepared statement which he had evidently hoped to make at the outset of the meeting. He said that, the people of the southern Cameroons were grateful to the United Kingdom for the benefits which had
come to them during the period of British administration. They were also grateful for being given the chance to determine their own future. It was right that, despite the grant of independence to Nigeria, the separate identity of the Cameroonsshould be preserved until plebiscites could be held. They were particularly grateful to Mr. Lennox-Boyd for his readiness to preserve that opportunity for them atthe conferences on the constitutional future of Nigeria. He also wished to expresshis appreciation of the work which had been done in his territory by expatriateofficers. Finally, he expressed his appreciation for the grants from the colonial development and Welfare Fund for the construction of roads in the southern Cameroons. Further investment in trunk roads would be required. Provision forminor roads could be made from the resources of the territory itself.Mr. Foncha went on to say that the future of the Southern Cameroons mustlie in association either with an independent Cameroon republic or with anindependent Nigeria. The choice must lie with the inhabitants. His own Partyfavoured union with a Cameroon republic. They did not wish to be associated withan independent Nigeria. This did not however affect their gratitude to the UnitedKingdom; and they would wish to maintain some sort of connexion with theUnited Kingdom even if they joined an independent Cameroon republic.As regards officials now employed in the Southern Cameroons, these werebeing assured that the result of the plebiscite, whichever way it went, need not prejudice their future and would not diminish the gratitude of the people for theirpast services.Mr. Macmillan said that, whatever the result of the plebiscite, it was important that the Government and people of the Southern Cameroons should in the meantimemaintain friendly relations with Nigeria. If the plebiscite resulted in union withthe French Cameroons, the unified territory would wish to be on friendly terms with Nigeria. On the other hand, if it resulted in union with Nigeria, it would be unfortunate if a climate of opinion had been created in which the southern Cameroons would not be welcomed back by Nigeria. On either view, therefore,it seemed desirable in this interim period to avoid any action which might endangerrelations between the Southern Cameroons and Nigeria. It was also important that everything should be done to ensure that in that interim period a stable and efficient Administration could be maintained in the territory. He hoped therefore that the Government would do all they could to encourage officers to stay on.Sir James Robertson said that it was to be hoped that Mr. Foncha would alsoascertain from the Premier of the French Cameroons the precise terms on whichunion with a Cameroon republic could take place. If the two Premiers could agree on the principles, officials could meet and work out the details. But it was most important that, at the time of the plebiscite, the people should know clearlywhat union with a Cameroon republic would involve. They knew already whatwould be involved in union with Nigeria. Mr. Foncha said that he hoped todiscuss this question with the Premier of the French Cameroons in February.Sir James Robertson again stressed the importance of retaining during the interim period Nigerian officers who were serving in the Southern Cameroons,especially in the federal services. He reminded Mr. Foncha that these officerscould not be required to stay on: they must volunteer for this duty: and theGovernment must make a special effort to secure their goodwill if they wished toretain their services.In further discussion reference was made to the activities of terrorists in theFrench Cameroons, and the extent to which they were able, on a plea of politicalasylum, to operate from British territory. Sir James Robertson said thatreinforcements of Nigerian troops and police had been sent to this area to control the situation. He reminded Mr. Foncha that this assistance would not be availableafter Nigeria became independent. Mr. Foncha said that he hoped to be ableduring the interim period to recruit ex-servicemen from his own country to forma Home Guard for this purpose. Sir James Robertson said that it was very braveof Mr. Foncha to contemplate union with a territory which contained theseterrorists. To this Mr. Foncha replied that in a united Cameroon republic it wouldbe easier to preserve law and order. While the territories continued to be dividedthe authority of the Chiefs was being progressively undermined.
Record of a Conversation Between Mr. Macmillan and the Governor-General,held at Government House, Lagos, on Wednesday, 13th January, 1960,at 3-30 p.m.After luncheon on 13th January, the Prime Minister and Sir Norman Brookhad an informal talk with the Governor-General about the future of Nigeria.The main points which emerged may be summarised as follows:(1) The leading men in Federal politics were anxious to work a Parliamentarysystem based on the Westminster model. They were interested in itsforms and conventions and were keen to catch its spirit. There was little risk that Nigeria would develop into a one-Party State. For theParties were evenly balanced; and the fact that the country was organised on a federal basis would itself help to ensure the continuanceof an Opposition capable of providing an alternative Government.(2) The circumstances in Nigeria its large area and the great differences between the various Regions had made it inevitable that a federal formof constitution should be adopted. Though there were difficulties in operating a federal system, there was no reason to suppose that it couldnot be made to work in Nigeria. It had in fact been in operation for fiveyears and, although the machine had creaked, it had not broken down.It was expected that, with experience, the working of the system wouldprogressively improve.(3) Nigeria included a number of different tribes and religions, and there weremarked differences between the three Regions. But there was good reason to hope that, through the working of the federal system and withthe spread of education, the consciousness of unity and nationhoodwould grow. It was noticeable already that the University graduateswere thinking of themselves as &quot; Nigerians &quot; rather than Ibos, Yorubas,&amp;c. The same was true of the senior officers in Government service andof people who had occasion to go abroad on official or private business.(4) The first years of independence would impose a heavy strain on theAdministration. From that point of view independence was comingabout five years too early or, to put the same point another way,&quot; Nigerianisation &quot; of the public services should have begun five years earlier. Although there were large numbers of Nigerians in the public services, few of them had yet had sufficient experience to be able to takeover the most senior posts. Therefore, for some years to come theefficiency of the Administration would depend on the retention ofexpatriate officers. The prospects were not too discouraging. SpecialList B had, in particular, proved useful. If the political climatecontinued to be reasonably friendly, it was possible that a sufficient number of expatriate officers would stay on, at any rate during theopening years of independence.(5) The Governor-General gave the Prime Minister an account of the politicalmanoeuvres following the results of the Election. Azikiwe had evidentlyhoped to have a little time in which to explore the possibility of reaching an understanding with the Action Group which would have given him a majority in the House of Representatives. He had at first beenirritated to find that Abubakar had at once been invited to form aGovernment. Later, however, he realised that any working arrangement with the Action Group would in fact have split his own Party; and hewas then ready to come to terms with Abubakar. His conditions had,however, been fairly stiff. He had accepted the office of President ofthe Senate on the understanding that he would at a later date beappointed Governor-General: he had secured for members of his Partya larger number of offices than was strictly justified by the number of seats they had won in the Election: and he had evidently extracted otherpromises which had not yet been disclosed. Even so, it seemed likely that Abubakar would maintain his position.(6) Abubakar would probably wish the present Governor-General to continue in office for at least one further year. Thereafter, unless the situationchanged, he would recommend that Azikiwe should be appointedGovernor-General.
Record of a Meeting of the Executive Council of the Western Region of Nigeriaheld at Ibadan on Thursday, 14th January, 1960, at 12 noon present:United Kingdom NigeriaMr. Harold MacmillanSir Norman brook mr.

Akinyele, Olubadanof Ibadan, Minister without PortfolioDr. S. O. Biobaku, Secretary to Premierand Executive CouncilChief Akintola opened the meeting by welcoming Mr. Macmillan to WesternNigeria and saying how pleased he and his colleagues were that Mr. Macmillanwas able to meet them for an informal discussion. The Premier recognised howshort a time was at Mr. Macmillan&apos;s disposal and expressed his gratitude for thefact that he had been able to fit in a visit to Western Nigeria. The visit wouldpromote understanding between the United Kingdom Government and theGovernment of Western Nigeria. Chief Akintola hoped that, having come once,Mr. Macmillan would come again.Chief Akintola then went on to discuss the position of Nigeria in world affairs.He was anxious that, after independence, the Government of Nigeria should do everything it could to promote understanding between their country and theUnited Kingdom. He and his colleagues had been following with admirationMr. Macmillan&apos;s efforts to secure world peace. They thought it important alsothat, after Nigerian independence, the links between Nigeria and the rest ofthe Commonwealth should be preserved and strengthened.Chief Akintola then raised the question of the constitutional conference whichwas due to be held in April or May to consider the final steps to be taken beforeNigerian independence, including the drafting of the Nigerian Independence Billto be passed through the Parliament at Westminster. He hoped that the possibilitymight be considered of holding the conference in Nigeria, preferably in Lagos,rather than in the United Kingdom.
Chief Akintola then turned to the wider problems of Africa. He said that what was happening in East, Central and South Africa was of interest to the peopleof Western Nigeria, and that the issues which had arisen there must be faced inthe context of Africa as a whole. If things were done in some commonwealth countries in Africa which were repugnant to people elsewhere in Africa and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, this would progressively undermine the cohesionof the Commonwealth. All the members of the Commonwealth should accept thesame code of conduct involving equal opportunities and equal treatment for peopleof all races. The Premier said that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s position as the senior statesmanin the Commonwealth should enable him to exert his influence on other commonwealth countries to conform to such a code of conduct.Chief Akintola then said that Western Nigeria was looking to the older members of the Commonwealth, and especially to the United Kingdom, for economic assistance. He felt that the less developed members of theCommonwealth, such as Western Nigeria, had the right to expect a helping handfrom the United Kingdom in the future, as in the past. They would rather receiveassistance of this kind from the United Kingdom than from the United states or other countries. He had in mind the provision of technical experts and advisersas well as financial assistance. After all, he said, the strength of the Commonwealthderived from the strength of all its component parts. Furthermore, it would be apity if the impression were confirmed that it was the &quot; naughty boys &quot; who got the most help. When he had been in New York recently it was being said therethat a country had only to send a Minister to the Soviet Union in order to ensurethat the United States would offer it substantial sums of money for economic development.Chief Akintola ended by repeating his welcome to Mr. Macmillan andthanking him for his visit.In reply, Mr. Macmillan said that he was very glad of this opportunity to meetthe Premier and his colleagues for informal discussions. He counted it an honourto be in Nigeria at this historic time and he had thought that the previous day&apos;sceremony in the Houses of Parliament at Lagos was a remarkable and movingsymbol of the partnership between the United Kingdom and Nigeria.Chief Akintola had mentioned Nigeria&apos;s position in the world after independence. Mr. Macmillan said he was sure that Nigeria would have a very important position. In population, it was the largest country in Africa, and thefourth largest in the Commonwealth. So far as the country&apos;s wealth was concerned,its new buildings alone made it clear to the visitor that development was proceedingrapidly. Mr. Macmillan was aware of the great natural resources of Nigeria, not least the mineral oil recently discovered. The part which the country would play in world affairs would depend primarily on Nigerians themselves. As he had said on the previous day to the Houses of Parliament in Lagos, a federal system ofgovernment was not always an easy one to work and it called for special loyalties.But the Nigerian federal system was not unique either in the Commonwealth or inthe world. The Nigerian people had examples of successful federations in theUnited States, in Canada (where the French population of Quebec would notwillingly have entered a unitary State) and in Australia, where the different states had their own Governments on very similar lines to those of the Regions of nigeria. The strength of an independent Nigeria would depend largely on thepower of the different Regions to hold together in unity.On the question of the talks to be held to discuss the final steps to be taken before independence, Mr. Macmillan said that the issues involved were not broadissues of policy but rather the details of the legislation to be drafted for enactmentby the Parliament at Westminster. The legislative schedule was rather tight andthe convenience of all had to be considered in deciding where such discussions should be held. The Federal and Regional Governments in Nigeria would nodoubt consult together about the matters to be dealt with at them.Turning to Nigeria&apos;s role in Africa, Mr. Macmillan said that he thought itnatural and proper that the Premier and his colleagues should take an interest in what was happening in other parts of Africa. But he thought, if he might say so,that they should exercise some care in voicing their opinions publicly and officially.South Africa, for example, was a completely independent country. If oneindependent country of the Commonwealth publicly criticised the internal policyof another, this could in time destroy the basis of their association.  In matters of
this kind there was an important difference between public and private discussion..So far as Kenya was concerned, Mr. Macmillan was glad to tell the Premier andhis colleagues that things were moving forward. The emergency had recentlybeen brought to an end and a constitutional conference was to be held in london in the following week. In the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland there wereawkward problems to be faced: and he was now going on there to learn about them at first hand and to prepare himself for the difficult decisions of policywhich the United Kingdom Government would have to take after the monckton commission had reported.Mr. Macmillan went on to say that the Mau Mau movement in Kenya hadbeen the cause of great sorrow to us all. Some 1,800 Africans had been murderedby Mau Mau, as compared with 50 Europeans. However, that was over now andthe prospects looked brighter. He was very hopeful too that early progress wouldbe possible in Nyasaland. None the less, he hoped that the Premier and hiscolleagues would recognise, even if they had not had first-hand experience of Eastand Central Africa, that the countries there were very different from those of west Africa and that the problems they threw up were much more complex.Compared to West Africa, countries like Nyasaland were poor and backward andthe economies of East and Central Africa were very largely dependent on theefforts of the European settlers. In spite of this, the British Government had shown in Tanganyika, as in Ghana and elsewhere, that it was anxious to proceedwith constitutional advance as rapidly as circumstances allowed. In countries where three races, Africans, Europeans and Asians, had all made their homes inthe same land it would not prove easy to build a society where all would be ableto play their part in a system of government which would guarantee fair treatment to them all. Success had however been achieved elsewhere, for example in singapore, where the population was 50 per cent. Malayan and 50 per centChinese, and in Malaya, where the population was 60 per cent. Malayan and 40 percent. Chinese. There was no reason why, having succeeded in building multiracialsocieties in those territories, we should not succeed in other places too.Mr. Macmillan said that he had taken careful note of the Premiers remarksabout Western Nigeria&apos;s continuing need for external aid. He recognised this need,which he considered should be met in such a way as to increase and develop theinternal wealth of the receiving country. Men and money these were the two things required. The United States and Germany were both wealthy countries with a part to play here. At the present meetings in Paris consideration was being given to the possibility of forming a new international organisation to handle theprovision of aid to under-developed territories. In addition to this, however, theUnited Kingdom certainly had its own individual part to play. Mr. Macmillanwas sure that the Premier and his colleagues would understand that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s ability to help depended on its own economic strength. It could notinvest a deficit or lend an overdraft. In 1914 the British national debt had been 800 millions, now it was  27,000 millions. The servicing of this weight of debtwas a heavy burden. The basic need was that the economic and financial positionof the United Kingdom should remain sound. Furthermore, there were many other countries in Asia as well as in Africa looking for help of this sort.None the less, Mr. Macmillan was anxious to persuade people at home in theUnited Kingdom that they should adopt a &quot; good neighbour &quot; policy, and he hoped that, now that Britain&apos;s economy was sounder, we should be able to doeven more in the future than we had done in the past. We had given certainundertakings about continued assistance to the Nigerian Federal Government andwe would do all we could to help. So far as men were concerned, Mr. Macmillanemphasised the United Kingdom&apos;s readiness to provide experts and advisers. Hethought it very important to encourage a greater interchange of experts among thedifferent countries of the Commonwealth and quoted as an example the scholarshipscheme which had been worked out as a result of the recent CommonwealthEducation Conference.Mr. Macmillan concluded by thanking the Premier for the moderation withwhich he had expressed his views. During the remainder of his African tour and afterwards he would ponder deeply the lessons he had learned in West Africa.
Record of a Meeting of the Executive Council of the Eastern Region of Nigeriaheld at Enugu on Friday, 15th January, 1960, at 12 05 p.m.Present:NigeriaThe Hon. Dr. M, I.

Okeke, Minister ofAgricultureSecretary:Mr. A. I. OsakweDr. Okpara opened the meeting, which was quite informal, by welcomingMr. Macmillan to Eastern Nigeria. He then said that, while their first wish wasto entertain him during his short stay in the Region, he and his colleagues wouldalso like to take the opportunity of putting their views to him on one or two matters which were causing them concern.1. Southern CameroonsDr. Okpara said that the Government of the Eastern Region were worriedabout developments in the Southern Cameroons. There had been trouble in theformer French Cameroons at the time of the independence celebrations there, andthe Eastern Regional Government were afraid that this trouble might easily spread to the British Cameroons and thence across the border into the Eastern Region of nigeria. The Eastern Regional Government did not want to have a politicallyunstable territory on their border. The people of the Eastern Region hoped thatthe Southern Cameroons would decide to join the Federation of Nigeria. after all, many of their kith and kin lived in the Southern Cameroons. On the otherhand, if the Southern Cameroons decided not to join the Federation, somethingought to be done to ensure that troubled conditions in the Cameroons would notspread across the border into Nigeria.In reply, Mr. Macmillan said that he and the Governor-General had discussed this question with Mr. Foncha in Lagos. He fully understood the anxieties of theEastern Regional Government. He felt bound to say that he considered that the timing of the Cameroons plebiscites had been unfortunate. And another 18 monthsmight pass before a final decision on the future of the Southern Cameroons couldbe taken. That meant that there would be an interval of perhaps a whole yearbetween the date of Nigerian independence and the time when the future of theSouthern Cameroons was decided.United kingdom mr. Harold MacmillanSir Norman brook mr. T. J. BlighMr. J. H. Robertson
Three different problems arose out of this situation. First, there might be an administrative hiatus between the date of Nigerian independence and a finaldecision on the future of the territory. It was very important from the point ofview, not only of the people of the Southern Cameroons, but also of Nigeria andthe United Kingdom, that the administration of the territory should not collapseduring this period. He hoped that, after independence, the Nigerian governments would be ready to help the United Kingdom to ensure that proper administrationcontinued. Secondly, it was very important that, when the time came to hold the plebiscite, the issues should be placed clearly before the voters. The conditions onwhich the territory might join independent Nigeria had been established. It wasonly fair that the conditions on which the territory could join an independentCameroon republic should be stated equally clearly. The third problem was thatof preventing the political confusion and disorder now prevailing in the formerFrench Cameroons from spreading to the Southern Cameroons and into Nigeria.The frontiers were difficult to control, but he had discussed this point with theGovernor-General and he understood that measures were being taken to tighten upcontrol as far as possible.Dr. Okpara thanked Mr. Macmillan for his understanding of the problem and said that he and his Government would do what they could to help. Mr. Macmillanand Dr. Okpara agreed in discussion that Mr. Foncha&apos;s policy seemed somewhatrash. Dr. Okpara derived some comfort from the fact that Mr. Foncha&apos;s majoritywas very small.2. Economic DevelopmentDr. Okpara said that he would like to discuss the question of economic development in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. He and his colleagues wereimmensely grateful to the United Kingdom Government for the loan of  3 million and the promise of a further  12 million, a proportion of which was to be spent inthe Eastern Region. Independence would not mean anything to the man in the street if his standard of living did not rise. It was therefore important that theUnited Kingdom Government should continue to assist Nigeria economically, nolonger as a ruler, but as a friend.Dr. Okpara said that he wished especially to mention the particular proposal that the Colonial Development Corporation (C.D.C.) should establish plantationsin partnership with the Eastern Region Development Corporation (E.R.D.C.). Inthe original discussions the C.D.C. had said that a deadline would have to be drawneither in April or possibly in October 1960; and the E.R.D.C. was urged to handover plantations to the C.D.C. immediately. The C.D.C. had now decided,however, that the projects were not sufficiently advanced. If help for this project was to be forthcoming something would have to be done quickly.In reply, Mr. Macmillan said that after independence relations between theUnited Kingdom Government and the Governments of Nigeria on financial matters,as on others, would be conducted through different channels and on a different basis from those which had. been customary in the past. The commonwealth relations Office would be taking over from the Colonial Office. Its relations withNigeria would, for the most part, be through the Federal Government.The United Kingdom Government were, however, conscious of Nigeria&apos;s needfor continuing economic assistance. They would do all they could to help in thefuture, as in the past. Their capacity to help would, however, depend on Britain&apos;economic strength. They must earn a surplus in order to be able to make grants or loans to friends overseas. In recent years the national economy had been built up and was now stronger than it had been for some years. Although in the future the method by which we would give assistance would differ from that used in thepast our intention to carry out a &quot; good neighbour &quot; policy remained.Mr. Macmillan added that he would arrange for the particular point which Dr.. Okpara had raised to be examined.Dr. Okpara thanked Mr. Macmillan for his reply.
3. Other MattersDr. Okpara said that there were other matters which he would have wished toraise with Mr. Macmillan if more time had been available.Mr. Macmillan said that he would be ready to resume the discussion after thedinner at Government House that evening.Note.- There was in fact an opportunity for further talk after the dinner. Butthe only subject then raised by Dr. Okpara was that of rural water supplies in theEastern Region. He explained the need for further provision of water (bybore-holes and wells) in the rural areas, and expressed the hope that financialassistance would be forthcoming to enable the Regional Government to continue their current programme. The Governor endorsed the importance of this programme and suggested that the Regional Government would find it necessaryto give it a higher priority. Hitherto they had preferred to give priority to theclaims of education; but he believed that they would do well to revise this order of priority. The Prime Minister expressed interest but avoided any promise of further financial assistance from the United Kingdom.Note of a Meeting of the Executive Council of the Northern Region of Nigeriaheld at Kaduna on Saturday, 16th January, 1960, at 12 noonUnited kingdom mr.

Opening RemarksAlhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Premier, welcomed Mr. Macmillan to the meeting and said how pleased he and his colleagues were that Mr. Macmillan had found it possible to come to their country in 1960. By the end of the year Nigeria wouldbe independent and the Party which he and his colleagues represented (theNorthern People&apos;s Congress) would, thanks to the decision of the electorate, be in aposition to play an important part in the future both of the Federation of Nigeriaand of the Northern Region. As a Northerner he extended a special welcome toMr. Macmillan another Northerner. Like the Conservative Party in the UnitedKingdom the party which the Premier represented were anxious to preserve allthat was best in the traditions of the past. They were grateful for the part that britain had played in building up their country and they would never forget the help she had given in the last 60 years in laying sound foundations for a new and independent national life. During this period there had been no bloodshed orviolence and the people of Northern Nigeria had worked with British expatriateofficers as with friends and brothers. The Premier paid a special tribute to two great Colonial Secretaries, Lord Chandos and Mr. Lennox-Boyd. He concludedhis welcome by saying that, as Mr. Macmillan&apos;s present visit was so short, he hoped he would soon be able to come again.In reply, Mr. Macmillan said that he was touched by the warmth of thePremiers welcome. He would convey to Lord Chandos and to Mr. Lennox-Boydthe kind words which the Premier had spoken about them. He was very glad to be in Northern Nigeria, among fellow Northerners and Conservatives. he hoped that the coming of independence would strengthen, rather than weaken,the ties between Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Of course a Federal structurewas not an easy system to work. The Northern Region and the Northern People&apos;sCongress would have a special position and a special responsibility owing to their size and strength. He was confident that they would do all they could to makethe Federal system work. The British people looked upon 1960 as the beginningof a new era of mutual co-operation between themselves and the people of Nigeria.2. Economic development the Minister of Finance made a statement on economic development inNorthern Nigeria. He said that agriculture and animal husbandry were thebackbone of the economy and the bulk of Government revenue was deriveddirectly or indirectly from agricultural products. It was difficult for the regional government to plan ahead if their annual revenue was subject to wide fluctuations in world market prices for their products. The Regional Government had assumed responsibility for the finances of the region only in 1951 and since then they had had to deal with the legacy of the neglect suffered under the Central Government.In 1954 the Northern Region began to draw up a programme of economic development. The current development programme, which was due to end inMarch 1960, cost  26 million, of which  6 million had been provided from
Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. There was, however, a tremendousleeway to be made up and in the two years 1960-62 development expenditure of 18 million was proposed. Of this,  13 million seemed likely to be available,including the Region&apos;s share of the United Kingdom Exchequer Loan and of therecent Commonwealth Assistance Loan. It would be difficult to find the remaining 5 million. Contractor finance had been suggested, but it carried with it heavyinterest rates which the Regional Government would find it difficult to meet. Therewas likely to be no annual surplus on recurrent account for some years. further capital assistance would therefore be required. A free grant would of course be most welcome; but, if produce prices remained high, the Regional government might be able to service a loan. In the five years, 1962-67, the Minister of Financethought that development expenditure would be of the order of  10 million a year.The Minister of Finance said that so far the only capital assistance which the region had received without strings had been from the United Kingdom. his main worry now was how to raise the capital finance required for the future.Would it be possible, he asked, for the United Kingdom Government to giveoutright grants after independence to this big Region with a population of20 million?In reply, Mr. Macmillan said that the Minister of Finance had raised somelarge and difficult questions. The United Kingdom Government had already agreed to make funds available to Nigeria to cover the transitional period up to1961 and he understood that the Northern Region would have its share of this.He assured the Premier and his colleagues that thereafter the United kingdom would be sympathetic towards the needs of Nigeria and of the Northern Regionin particular though he assumed that after independence it would be for theFederal Government to deal with the United Kingdom Government on thesematters.The assistance required would be in two forms men and money. So faras men were concerned the question was how, at a time when Colonial status was becoming obsolete and the present expatriate service was dwindling, we in theUnited Kingdom could make available the professional and technical expertsrequired. A study of this problem had already been initiated in the UnitedKingdom. This should, however, be regarded as an inter-Commonwealth problem,and he hoped that it would be possible to make arrangements for a growinginterchange of experts between different countries in the Commonwealth.So far as money was concerned Mr. Macmillan said that the United KingdomGovernment would do all they could to help. There were heavy calls upon us and our ability to help depended on our ability to earn a surplus ourselves. Itwas not possible to invest a deficit or lend an overdraft. Our first efforts must beto strengthen our own economy and so provide the basis for helping others. Againwe had to consider priorities. We had to think of Asia, and particularly of India,as well as Africa. None the less he was deeply impressed with the need for capital investment in Nigeria. The Premier and his colleagues would no doubt understandif he was unwilling to enter any definite commitment now, but he undertook thatthe United Kingdom Government would examine very carefully what they could do to ensure that capital investment continued in Nigeria after independence.3. Northern CameroonsThe Premier said that after 1st October the United Kingdom Governmentwould be entirely responsible for the administration of the Northern Cameroons.He thought it very important that a good administrator should be appointed, whohad experience of Nigerian affairs and would be sympathetic to her interests.Mr. Macmillan said that he had discussed this general problem with theGovernor-General in Lagos. The position was undoubtedly awkward. The UnitedKingdom Government would be responsible for the territory until a final decision about its future was taken, and this might not be for another 18 months. He agreedthat the Administration must on no account be allowed to collapse; goodsubordinate officers as well as a good administrator would be required. In theSouthern Cameroons there was the additional problem of preventing violencespreading from the Cameroons Republic into the British Cameroons and intoNigeria. The borders were difficult to control but every possible precaution wasbeing taken. The timing of the plebiscites had been unfortunate but we must makethe best of the awkward situation which had arisen.
4. Security LiaisonThe Premier said that he greatly valued the presence of a British SecurityLiaison Officer in Kaduna. Northern Nigeria was bordered on three sides by french territory, and this inevitably involved some security risk. The SecurityLiaison Officer had proved very useful in providing information about events in french territory and the Premier hoped that this appointment would be continuedafter independence.Mr. Macmillan said that he was glad to hear how highly the Premier valuedthe Security Liaison Officer. To have him stationed in Kaduna was of benefit both to the United Kingdom and to the Northern Regional Government. It was vital that security should be maintained and he would bear in mind what the Premier had said.5. Commonwealth Civil service the Premier asked whether any thought was being given to the possibility ofestablishing a Commonwealth Civil Service. Such a Service would be useful, notonly to the undeveloped countries of the Commonwealth, but also to the older members. To illustrate what he had in mind, he referred to the problem of watersupply. Dutch consultants had been invited to Northern Nigeria to study theproblem and submit a report. This had been done; but what was needed now wasa number of technicians who could put into operation the scheme recommended bythe consultants.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government were conscious ofthe need for technical experts and advisers in the newly independent countries of theCommonwealth, and they were trying to work out some practical plan for meeting this need. It was a difficult problem because it was necessary to guarantee that aioctor or engineer, for example, would be able to resume his career in his own country after his assignment abroad was over. He was not sure what scope therewould be for guaranteeing a full career for such people in a Commonwealth Service:but he would certainly see that this possibility was considered, along with others, inthe review which was now being made in London.After the meeting the Premier handed to Sir Norman Brook a note on thissubject which is reproduced in the Annex.6. Supply of TeachersThe Minister of Education referred, with appreciation, to the results of theCommonwealth Education Conference recently held at Oxford. Not enoughexpatriate teachers were now coming out to Northern Nigeria. He believed that, if more suitably qualified people were to come, it would be necessary to find some wayof safeguarding their careers at home.Mr. Macmillan said that he was not quite clear whether questions concerningassistance from overseas would fall to be dealt with by Regional Governments or bythe Federal Government after independence. But, in the general review to whichhe had referred (Minute 5 above) the United Kingdom Government would certainlykeep in mind the need for teachers. He was glad to know that the NorthernRegional Government appreciated the results of the Commonwealth EducationConference.
AnnexA POSSIBLE COMMONWEALTH CIVIL service note by Government of Northern Region of NigeriaSuch a Service might obtain its recruits from all member States of theCommonwealth and would consist of &quot; field officers &quot; rather than the &quot; expert-type &quot;of officers. Experts have a very limited value in that they may advise on what should be done to meet a certain problem but if there are no field officers to carryout their advice no progress is made.2. Members of such a Commonwealth Service could be hired by anyCommonwealth country who required their service either when their own nationalshad been trained in sufficient numbers or when some particular drive or campaignwas required in connexion with a particular service.3.   The advantages of such a Service will be as follows:(a) Civil Servants of guaranteed ability and security-safe would be available to member States of the Commonwealth when required.(b) A member of the Commonwealth would be able to hire these Civil Servantsfor any period required. The general needs of all the commonwealth would however provide continual employment for such a service.(c) Such a Service would attract the best type of recruits as it would guaranteean interesting and permanent career.(d) All Commonwealth members would supply recruits for the Service althoughprobably those States with the greater number of trained personnel would supply more than others.(e) As all members of the Commonwealth, with the exception of South Africa,have the same ideals and principles there would be no political troublesor rivalries among the staff as occur in many international organisations,and no member State would feel that there were any strings orcommitments attached to the acceptance of the assistance.(/) Such a Civil Service would help to bind the Commonwealth closer togetherby each member gaining advantages from the work and assistance ofother members.
MAIN POLICY SPEECHText of Speech delivered by Mr. Macmillan in the House of Representatives,Nigeria, on Wednesday, 13th January, 1960Mr. Speaker, nearly 400 years ago, to be exact in the year 1571, queen elizabeth I sent a message to the House of Commons telling them not to wastetheir time over matters which did not concern them and to avoid long speeches.As to the first point, the Governor-General in his Speech from the Throne, was certainly more gracious, but on the second, Parliaments, wherever they may be,would do well to bear in mind the great Queen&apos;s warning.I am very conscious, Sir, of the great honour which has been done me to-day.For me, of course, it is an absolutely unique occasion. I am proud to feel thatI am the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to be granted the privilege of addressing you . . . But, if I may say so, for another very different reason it isa unique occasion for you too, since your Prime Minister will tomorrow proposea historic motion. If this is passed, then this Parliament which opens here to-daywill be the first Parliament of an independent Nigeria. ... I need hardly tellyou how keenly my colleagues and I in Great Britain are looking forward to thetime when, as we hope, Nigeria will take its place among the full members of theCommonwealth.This day therefore marks the end of one era in your national life and theopening of another. First, at home in my country, it represents the fulfilment in nigeria of the policies which we have been and still are steadily pursuing in territories for whose welfare and political development we have been responsible.You have come here from every corner of this vast country, freely elected by secretballot. You have, as is right and proper, your own local loyalties, but you come here not merely as one tribe or another but first and foremost as Nigerians ... Itseems to me that if the past hundred years of your association with Britain hasborne no other fruit, one could at least claim with justice that it has led to thecreation of a united country. Unity is strength. Your strength and your influencewill be the greater by your unity.Of course, I realise that a federal system is not the easiest form of governmentto conduct. In any Federation there are bound to be stresses and strains whichthreaten unity and this calls for an exceptional degree of understanding andforbearance. It is for you in this Federal Parliament so to order your affairs with due regard to the views and interests of all sections of the Nigerian people. that means really that you must do your best to see the other man&apos;s point of view andeven if you cannot always agree with him, try to understand him and meet himhalf way. For that, after all, is one of the main principles of Parliamentarydemocracy that we have adopted and you have adopted.Some people I know-and you have made some reference to it, Mr. PrimeMinister some people are beginning to think that Parliaments are a cumbrousway of doing business in this modern world. Sometimes one is tempted to think the same about democracy, especially when one has lost an election. I havecontested in the last 37 years 11 elections. In the first six of these, if I remember,I won three times and lost three times. You cannot have it harder than that. Ofcourse, when one loses one is tempted to think the whole thing ridiculous, the people are being misled by demagogues, but when you win, why then you say, &quot; I alwaysknew the people were sound at heart &quot;. Well, there it is. We should all havea sense of proportion and a sense of humour. In any case, so long as we value thefreedom of speech, freedom to express our opinions within such licence as mr. Speaker in his wisdom is willing to allow us, I know of no better system thana fairly elected Parliament for giving people the sort of Government they want.I have spoken, Sir, of the strains and stresses within a Federation. WhenNigeria becomes a full member of the Commonwealth, you will find the sameapplies to that association also. How can it be otherwise with so many and suchdiverse countries and Governments? No doubt there will be times when ourpoints of view may not completely coincide, but let us try always to understandand respect each other&apos;s point of view. Here you are united in one purpose, thefurthering of the well-being of the people of Nigeria. And likewise in theCommonwealth, despite our differences and there must be differences of emphasis,
of mood, of approach we are united in our common aim to work for thepreservation of peace and the betterment of all mankind.Since the Statute of Westminster, the form of our association has changedbut not, I think, the spirit. Great Britain is now no longer the ruler of a greatcolonial empire but she is a member, I would hardly say senior but at least afoundation member, of a great Commonwealth. As such we feel that with partsof Africa and Asia and of the Antipodes and of the Americas with all these partsof the world we have close links. In all of them we have real friends and partners.Above all, we try never to forget the millions of people in the under-developed countries of the world in whom we have so close an interest. Their needs must be our needs and for us the primary purpose of policy is the preservation of peacewith justice and the rising prosperity throughout the world.Throughout my time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I have beenconscious when speaking for my own country in many international meetings, ofthe hopes and wishes of my fellow members of the Commonwealth. We all, as you know, keep in constant touch with each other. For instance, in 1958, twoyears ago nearly, it seemed that we might be faced with a dangerous situationabout Berlin, and I was supported by the knowledge that our sister countries willbe with me in seeking by all honourable means to avert the stark clash which thenthreatened. My visit to Moscow to which you referred, Mr. Prime Minister, wasnot undertaken without heart-searching. I saw that there were potential dangersand that I was running a risk, but all this visiting has become much more popularsince then. There was a risk, but then the world is a place in which progress cannotbe made by sitting at home. I believe that the conversations which we had contributed in no small degree to a general easing of tension.Now we have at last fixed a date for the Summit meeting, between the UnitedKingdom, the United States, France and Soviet Russia. Moreover, as the interchange of letters between us show, it is agreed that this meeting shall be thefirst of a series.There is, I know, a subject about which the people in Nigeria and other partsof Africa, and indeed all over the world, feel a special anxiety. I think it wouldbe wrong if I did not say something about it. I mean the invention and developmentof nuclear weapons. Their immense destructive power must make us all feelanxious. We in Britain would like to see an end of nuclear tests and in due course the abolition of nuclear weapons as part of a comprehensive scheme of disarmament; and yet by a strange paradox, until disarmament is reached, it is partly by the existence of these frightful weapons that an uneasy peace has beenpreserved. For even the aggressor knows that in a nuclear age there can be novictory, there can only be universal and impartial destruction. Pendingdisarmament both in the field of nuclear and conventional weapons, it is mutualfear which has restrained aggression, but we cannot, Sir, be content with thisignoble balance. We therefore pursue with all the vigour we can the struggle forthe first steps at least in the reduction of international armaments and the key to disarmament is to be found, and can only be found, in some acceptable systemof international inspection and control.We of the United Kingdom have taken the lead. The best way we felt to makea start would be by the cessation of nuclear tests. So we, the British Government,nearly two years ago proposed a technical conference with the Americans and russians to discuss the scientific questions involved. This proposal was accepted and from this scientific conference sprang the present meetings at Geneva in whichwe are trying laboriously to hammer out an agreement for the ending of tests of nuclear weapons. I know that people in West Africa have been and are deeplyand genuinely concerned on this subject. In particular I heard with great respect and sympathy the representations that were made to me on this subject by thePrime Minister only a few months ago. Also there are two separate issues: theimmediate question as to whether a nuclear explosion in the Sahara would causeany material damage to Nigeria or other African countries. I hope and believethat our scientific advisers have been able to reassure your Government as a resultof the Prime Ministers visit; but more generally this is the big issue. I want to assure you that we are profoundly anxious for all nuclear tests to be brought toan end anywhere in the world, in Africa, just as much as in Asia, Europe, America,or the Pacific. At the moment there are only three existing nuclear Powers andthey are taking part in the conference at Geneva; but I have no doubt that if wecan only reach agreement there then we shall be able to bring the other countries
of the world to join us and that is, I believe, the most practical step forward thatwe can take. I venture to speak, Sir, at some length about these problems becausethey are of vital importance to us all, and in facing them we shall especially valuethe advice and assistance of your great country in our Commonwealth team, foryou certainly bring great assets to the common partnership of our Commonwealth.In population Nigeria is the largest country in Africa, the fourth largest in theCommonwealth. It has an area four times the size of the United Kingdom. Inthe course of my short visit I shall, alas, only be able to see a very little of whatyour country has to offer, some of your principal towns. I am sorry I shall not beable to see some of the countryside and of the agriculture which is the basis ofyour prosperity. Your exports find places in most of the markets of the world;oil palm and groundnuts provide food for people everywhere. I think too ofyour cocoa, your cotton, your rubber, your timber, the workings from which youproduce tin and that rare mineral columbite and the imagination of us all, ofcourse, has been quickened in recent months by the discovery of workablequantities of mineral oil in Nigeria. I congratulate you on this discovery. Nigeriaalready has a diversified economy, but a flourishing oil industry will I hopestrengthen this still further. This is indeed a fertile and productive country whichis already contributing to the welfare not only of its own people but of the world,and I am glad to think that you have plans for further development for it is inthe economic as well as in the political sense that you are going to play a worthyand notable part.As you have said, Mr. Prime Minister, in this wonderful scene, this greatChamber, this Parliament just elected, I see people of a wide variety coming froma great area. It is not surprising that there should be divergencies, differences; wehave them at home. Of course, we all know Scotland is the best part of the UnitedKingdom but it is not always accepted by all my compatriots! You have differentraces, Ibos and Yorubas in the south and the coastland; Hausas and Fulanis in thenorth and many other peoples too. All of them have made their contribution, eachhas had its great man who made for themselves a niche in the history of yourcountry and the memories of your people. Again, if you will allow me just for a mount, for this is indeed a very notable occasion, I cannot help thinking of manyof my own countrymen and women who have played their part in your history:Mungo Park, Clapperton, Mary Slessor, all these lie buried here, and later Lugardwho devoted 25 years of his life to build the foundations of modern Nigeria anddied only 15 years ago just when you were taking the final steps towards the goalwhich will be reached on 1st October next. His place, Lord Lugard&apos;s place, inyour history&apos;s eye is assured, and the famous words he spoke about the dualmandate are as true to-day as when he spoke them. I will quote them. &quot; First, topromote the moral and material welfare of the African peoples, and secondly todevelop the natural resources of Africa not only for its peoples but for allmankind &quot;.Sir, we have tried as best we can to build on these principles and we are proudand happy to have seen this day. A country&apos;s history is made not only through itsfamous leaders and I have mentioned some but by all those who serve it loyally.Many such servants you have had, from overseas and from your own place.Humble men, whose names are perhaps forgotten, but whose work endures. nor have those sacrifices been confined to this country; the Nigerians have proudlyserved the common cause in other parts of the world. I can never forget the part played in the liberation of Burma by the 81st and 82nd West African Divisions.It is extraordinary, Sir, to reflect upon how rapid the march has been. It maysometimes have seemed slow, but in reality it has been rapid. During that periodof British responsibility there have been eight Governors and Governors-General.Nigeria has come I think we can claim this to independence without strife orbitterness between our peoples. It has been a notable triumph of the principle ofpartnership in practice, and I trust that that partnership between equals willcontinue in the years to come. You, for your part, can be assured of the boundlessgoodwill of the people of Britain. If we can be of any service to you by providingexperts or anything of that kind, we will do our best, and in the things which you have to offer us you will be not unmindful of an old and well-tried friendship. Wehave worked honourably and well together, and I am confident that in this newera which opens up on 1st October, our peoples will work together in equalpartnership, and I hope I may say real affection for their common good and forthe service of mankind.SECRET56647 i
DESPATCH TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESFROM THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL, NIGERIA(Despatch No.: Personal 17) 19 th February, 1960.Sir,I wrote privately to you on the day of the departure of the Prime Ministerand Lady Dorothy Macmillan from Nigeria to tell you briefly of the success oftheir visit to the Federation. Now that the Prime Minister has returned to theUnited Kingdom I think that you may wish to have my assessment of the impressionmade on Nigerians by the visit to Nigeria and also, in the wider sphere, of there actions here to the African tour as a whole.2. As I told you in my letter of 18th January, the Prime Minister and lady Dorothy Macmillan received everywhere they went in Nigeria a warm and friendly welcome and the visit as a whole went extremely well. I think that itis true to say that the warmth of the welcome was genuine and spontaneous and,among those who take an interest in world affairs, stemmed from a feeling ofadmiration for one who has, as the Prime Minister of the Federation put it,&quot; broken the ice barrier &quot; in his search for peace; among the vast mass of thepopulation it was, I think, an expression of their gratitude and affection for theBritish connexion.3. Within a few months of the country&apos;s independence the political leadersof Nigeria were, I am sure, flattered and delighted to be included in a tour of full members of the Commonwealth (or in the case of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, of a country which has by convention a seat at Commonwealthconferences). It was noteworthy that suggestions made in the United Kingdom(and raised by visiting United Kingdom Press representatives) that the PrimeMinister of the Federation should be invited to attend the forthcoming meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in May found no echo in Nigeria. Nigeriansare content to be entering into full membership of the Commonwealth in october and they have voiced no wish to &quot; jump the gun &quot;. The Prime Minister, particularly by his speech to the Federal Parliament which was extremely well received,succeeded in defining for Nigerians both the values and the difficulties of theCommonwealth connexion and in that respect the visit has created an admirableclimate for Nigerian participation in Commonwealth affairs.4. The continued unity of the Federation is, of course, essential for Nigeria&apos;political and economic future, but it is not always so recognised by Nigeriansthemselves. I have no doubt that the manner in which the need for unity was stressed by the Prime Minister has had a beneficial effect.5. In his discussions with Ministers both in Lagos and in the Regions, thePrime Minister was informed constantly of the need of the Governments in nigeria to continue to rely for many years on outside assistance for manpower,advice and finance. I think also that it was made clear to him that there was a genuine desire that these forms of assistance should be forthcoming from theUnited Kingdom and, by implication, that a general desire existed to retain therebythe closest ties with Great Britain. The Prime Minister gave clear indications ofGreat Britain&apos;s willingness to give what assistance lay in her power and I am sure that as a result of their discussions with him Nigerian Ministers will be expectinghelp on a generous scale. Especially will they look for a continuation in some formor other (and preferably in a form which financially is of no less value) of theassistance which has hitherto come from the Colonial Development and WelfareAct and from the operations of the Colonial Development Corporation.6. With regard to reactions within Nigeria to the African tour as a whole,there was I think disappointment that the visit to Central Africa was not markedby some such vivid gesture as the release of Dr. Banda from detention and, generallyspeaking, the Central African part of the visit did not get a good Press in NigeriaBut all this was forgotten in the enthusiasm aroused by the Prime Minister^speech in Cape Town. Here at last was the categorical denunciation of&quot; apartheid &quot; for which African nationalists had been waiting and here too wasthe outspoken recognition that the nationalism sweeping Africa to-day is a fact of life which can neither be ignored nor resisted. But in Nigerian eyes the CapeTown speech will not of itself suffice; they will not easily accept in the United
Nations a United Kingdom vote which disassociates itself from a condemnationof those policies Which the Prime Minister made clear were contrary to what GreatBritain stands for. While Nigeria will be eager to resist interference in her own affairs she will not hesitate to support interference in the internal affairs of othercountries, Commonwealth or non-Commonwealth, where racial prejudice isconcerned.7.

PART IVFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDCOMMENTARYBefore the Prime Minister^ arrival, the atmosphere in the Federation was already disturbed by a feeling of uncertainty. The year 1960, which was to seethe visit of the Monckton Commission and the opening of the ConstitutionalReview Conference, was already marked in the minds of the politically consciousas a year of decision. More specific fears had been aroused by reports of whatthe Prime Minister was alleged to have said at a Press conference in Lagos on13th January, and of a television interview given by Lord Shawcross. Both seemedto imply that the United Kingdom Government were prepared to see the break-upof the Federation if African opinion in the two northern territories so demanded.There was a general lack of confidence in the intentions of the United KingdomGovernment towards the Federation aggravated by the disappointment of theEuropean population at realising that the result of the General Election in britain had not, after all, resolved all their difficulties. Pleased at the defeat of the party which they believed to represent the main threat to their interests, they werecorrespondingly depressed to discover that opinion in the Conservative Party didnot seem likely to concur in the rapid achievement of their ambition to control the destinies of the Federation.There was uncertainty in the business world as well. As the Finance ministers of both the Federal and the Southern Rhodesian Governments pointed out at their meetings with the Prime Minister, firms were putting off plans for expansion andavoiding new commitments. The foundations of Federation were being questioned.More than anything else the Europeans wanted to feel that the United kingdom was still behind them.One of the Prime Ministers principal aims in his speech at Salisbury on19th January was to allay these anxieties. In this he was undoubtedly successful.It is noteworthy that the audience applauded vigorously, not only the PrimeMinisters strong expressions of support for the idea of Federation, but also the numerous passages in which he reaffirmed the determination of the UnitedKingdom Government to fulfil their obligations to the Africans and praised the concept of partnership. The immediate effect on confidence was marked. But it did not last for long. European opinion in the Federation is volatile, and soon after the Prime Minister had left there were already signs of a reversion to theearlier state of anxiety.The business talks with Sir Roy Welensky and with Sir Edgar Whiteheadopened in rather a threatening mood, and several of the subjects on the agendaseemed likely to lead to difficult arguments. After discussion it appeared that alldifferences had been amicably resolved. It was noticeable that the two PrimeMinisters could be brought more rapidly to see, and fall in with, the view of theUnited Kingdom Government than their Ministerial colleagues. Both of them,too, took a more robust attitude towards the problems of the future than their colleagues, who often seemed oppressed by a lack of confidence in themselves.The effect of the Prime Minister^ visit was somewhat marred by the differences which subsequently arose over the release of Dr. Banda. Because of shortness oftime and the need to digest the advice received from the Governors of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Prime Minister was not able to reach an agreement on this question with Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead before he leftSalisbury. In the event the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations hadto fly to Rhodesia to continue these discussions.The Prime Minister found that the Monckton Commission was still regarded with intense suspicion and hostility both by the Governments of the federation and of Southern Rhodesia and by the public at large. Not only was it condemnedas an undesirable intrusion but the more politically conscious suspected it as adevice for postponing, and compromising, the consideration of their just claims to independence. The Prime Minister devoted much effort to countering this attitude. To the two Cabinets he pointed out that, as public opinion in the UnitedKingdom had not yet fully accepted the case for Federation, any suspicion that
either of them was trying to sabotage the Commission might do irremediableharm. The sensible course was to get full value from the Commission by ensuring that cogent evidence in support of the thesis of the United Federal Party was put before it. In public he pointed out that, as with all international conferences, theFederal Review Conference should be carefully prepared in advance; and thatthe Monckton Commission would serve as a great briefing for the five Governmentsconcerned.Another point on which European opinion in Salisbury needed reassurancewas the future of the northern territories. The average European was afraid thatAfrican nationalism was getting a grip on these territories. The Southern RhodesianCabinet made it clear to the Prime Minister that they would not wish to remain a member of the Federation if that federal bond linked them to States wherepolitical power was in the hands of illiterate voters.In Southern Rhodesia the views of the Europeans are politically the mostimportant. The Southern Rhodesian Africans, by. and large a contented and peaceful community, have as yet scarcely achieved any organised politicalmachinery for the expression of their views. At the meeting with African leadersorganised by Sir Edgar Whitehead, the opinions put forward were moderate and reasonable. In Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, where the proportion of african to European inhabitants is much higher, the importance of African opinion is correspondingly greater. In both of those territories the Prime Minister wasfaced by demonstrators flourishing placards and in some cases shouting slogans.In Northern Rhodesia the principal theme of these was universal franchise; in nyasaland it was hostility to the Federation. In the former territory thedemonstrators showed great personal friendliness towards Mr. Macmillan, wavingand clapping when he waved to them; and there was no friction with the police.But in Nyasaland, where a state of emergency was still in force, there were someclashes with the police at Chileka and Blantyre. These were by no means so serious as Press reports would suggest; and they may perhaps be ascribed as much,if not more, to over-anxiety on the part of the police as to greater animosity onthe part of the Africans.The Southern Rhodesian visit was restricted entirely to Salisbury. In northern rhodesia the Prime Minister covered a good deal of ground and heard a diversityof opinions both from Europeans and Africans. He had to listen to a number ofspeeches at civic lunches which, in one form or another, expressed the generallypaternalistic attitude of European unofficial opinion towards the Africans. much the same attitude was expressed to him, in less strident terms, by Europeans inofficial positions, who took the view that it might be decades before there wereenough educated and trained Africans to fill ministerial and administrative posts.The Africans he saw, who included leaders from all the political Parties in theterritory, naturally contested this, but they did not show the extreme hostility to federation which was evident in Nyasaland. There, the visits to Zomba andBlantyre were only brief; but there also the Prime Minister saw representativesof all political parties. The feeling of suspense and uncertainty was as strongthere as anywhere in the Federation. Everything was felt to depend on the issueof the release of Dr. Banda. The prevailing impression left was that in Nyasalandthe cause of Federation was almost desperate because of the systematic poisoningof African opinion against it. The only grounds for hope seemed to lie in thepossibility of so rapid an advance to self-government in all matters of territorialinterest as to reconcile Dr. Banda&apos;s followers to continuing in the Federalframework.It is likely that the main impact of the visit will be the jolt which it gave to european opinion. If it results in a greater realisation of the purposes of theFederation and a closer co-ordination of policy between the four Governments, itwill have been of great value.On the physical side the tour of the Federation was rather less strenuous thanthe preceding tour of Nigeria, and climatically much less trying. The PrimeMinister had, however, to do a lot of travelling and he had also to conduct aseries of delicate and difficult discussions with each of the four Governments. Theresult was probably equally demanding.

RECORDS OF MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONSA. Federation and Southern RhodesiaRecord of a Meeting of Ministers held at Salisbury on 19th January, 1960,at 8 45 a.m.Present:United Kingdom Southern RhodesiaMr. Harold Macmillan Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister ofSir Norman Brook the FederationSir Edgar Whitehead, Prime Ministerof Southern RhodesiaMr. J. M. Greenfield, Minister of LawMr. A. D. Evans, Secretary, Ministryof Home AffairsSir Roy Welensky said that he and the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiawere glad to have this opportunity to discuss with Mr. Macmillan a number of questions which were all, in varying degrees, related to the work of the monckton commission and the future of the Federation. He himself had already had someinformal talk on these at the private meeting which he had had with Mr. Macmillanon the previous evening; but he was glad that Sir Edgar Whitehead andMr. Greenfield would now be able to express their views. There were twoimmediate difficulties about the work of the Monckton Commission. First, the unfortunate remarks which Lord Shawcross had made in a television interview had created a widespread impression within the Federation that the Commission would go outside their terms of reference. The Dominion Party were indeed preparing to put before the Commission a case for dissolving the Federation. Secondly,there was much alarm at the possibility that extremists of both sides would use the Commission as a means of gaining undesirable publicity. All this made itdifficult to find an acceptable formula about immunity for evidence tendered tothe Commission.More broadly, Ministers in Salisbury were concerned about the attitude ofthe United Kingdom Government towards the future of the Federation. Hithertothey had assumed that Britain favoured its continuation. Some recent developmentshad caused them to wonder whether there had been some change in UnitedKingdom policy on this.Finally, Sir Roy Welensky said that there was concern at the rumours of the impending release of Dr. Banda. He had hoped that he would be consulted about this before any decision was taken. It now appeared that a decision to releaseDr. Banda had been taken without consultation with the Government of theFederation. He himself believed that, if Dr. Banda were released in the near future,this would substantially increase the security risks in Nyasaland.Sir Edgar Whitehead recalled that Southern Rhodesia had enjoyed self-government since 1923 and might by now have achieved independence if it hadnot joined the Federation. Southern Rhodesia had surrendered some of its separatepowers to the Federation, and had sacrificed the early prospect of independence,in the wider interest of Central Africa as a whole. They had taken this step withtheir eyes open to the fact that it would postpone their independence for someyears. It now seemed however that this postponement would be even longer than had originally been contemplated; and as a result feeling was now growing in southern Rhodesia in favour of withdrawal from the Federation. Though he himself still believed firmly in Federation, he would have difficulty in controllingthat feeling. The destruction of the Federation would, in his opinion, be disastrous,especially for Nyasaland. The only hope of raising the standard of living in nyasaland lay in the continuance of Federation. Without the assistance it drewfrom other parts of the Federation it would degenerate into a rural slum.Nevertheless, he feared that the people of Southern Rhodesia would not be willingto continue their support for the Federation unless their minimum conditionscould be satisfied in the course of 1960.SECRET56647 k 2
Mr. Macmillan said that in all these problems he would like to draw a distinction between strategy and tactics. If the Governments concerned could agree upon a common strategy, they would be better able to handle the difficultiesof the tactical situation. The United Kingdom Government were convinced thatFederation, though it involved some sacrifices by some of its members, had great advantages for the whole. The best prospect of economic progress in Nyasalandcertainly lay in continued membership of the Federation. And even SouthernRhodesia, though it had postponed its prospects of independence by joining the Federation, had thereby secured the advantages of membership of a largereconomic unit. The United Kingdom Government had not changed their policy towards the Federation. It was true that some uncertainties had developed in public opinion in Britain due largely perhaps to propaganda by the Church ofScotland and to the sympathies felt for the growth of national consciousness in africa. The Labour Party had naturally tried to make the most of this situation;and the Government had to handle the position carefully, for this was a subject on which liberal and sentimental streams of opinion in the United Kingdom could easily be exploited. Public opinion must be brought round to see more clearly the advantages, political as well as economic, which Federation could bring toall its constituent parts. Difficult decisions would have to be taken by Governmentsat the end of 1960, and it would be a mistake to allow propaganda hostile to the concept of Federation to build up throughout the year. There were already some signs that public opinion was steadying. And the work of the monckton commission should be of great value in influencing public opinion in the UnitedKingdom. This was a strong Commission, containing a number of highly intelligentmen; and he certainly hoped that their report would present the true facts of theexisting situation and an objective appraisal of the practical means of making further progress. It was certainly not the function of the Commission to destroy the Federation: on the contrary its function was to find means by which it could go forward. This was clear from its terms of reference: and he proposed to make that plain in the public speech which he would be making later that day.Mr. Macmillan added that he also proposed to clear up, in that speech, themisunderstanding which had arisen about the statement which he made at hisPress Conference in Lagos. As he would show, from trie precise text of that statement, he had not then been referring at all to the possibility of secession fromthe Federation, but to the eventual right of all its constituent parts to decide whetherthey should continue in an independent Federation.On the question of immunity for evidence given to the Monckton Commission,Mr. Macmillan said that it ought to be possible to reach agreement on a formula.In substance what seemed to be required was that witnesses should be immune from prosecution in respect of statements made in oral evidence to the commissioner contained in written evidence published by the Commission. He quite agreedthat people should not be enabled to make use of the Commission by submittingwritten evidence which was libellous or seditious and simultaneously, orsubsequently, publishing it in the Press. They should not then be allowed to claim immunity on the ground that this was a statement &quot; made to theCommission &quot;.As regards Dr. Banda, Mr. Macmillan undertook to consult further with sir Roy Welensky after his visit to Nyasaland, when he would discuss the general security situation with the Governor. The timing of Dr. Banda&apos;s release was largely a matter of tactics. The main objective in Nyasaland must be to end theemergency and make a start with constitutional progress. It was in the interestof the Federation that constitutional reform in Nyasaland should proceed as rapidly as possible; for otherwise the eventual attainment of independence bythe Federation as a whole would be delayed.Mr. Greenfield said that he had been encouraged by what Mr. Macmillan had said about the Monckton Commission. He still felt, however, that the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and the Federation were to some extent at cross purposesabout this. The Government of the Federation had not wanted the Commission,and had agreed to it only on condition that its terms of reference should not allowit to consider alternatives to Federation. They had been seriously embarrassed by subsequent &quot; interpretations &quot; which seemed to have had the effect of wideningthe terms of reference. From this point of view the statement made byLord Shawcross had been specially damaging. They had also been embarrased by the emphasis laid by United Kingdom Ministers on the fact that the Monckton
Commission would be free to hear evidence from Africans, including those under detention. As a result, in the two Northern territories, active steps were now beingtaken to persuade Africans to give evidence against Federation. In this connexionhe drew attention to material published in Nshila, the official information journalof the Northern Rhodesian Government: its issue of 5th January had containedmaterial which in his judgment was a direct incitement to Africans to give evidencehostile to Federation. Officials of the Northern Rhodesian Government were bythis means continuing a campaign against Federation. At this point Mr. Macmillansuggested that it would have been an even worse situation if Africans had carriedout their threat to boycott the work of the Monckton Commission.In further discussion Sir Edgar Whitehead said that he was still concerned about the question of immunity for evidence tendered to the monckton commission. The Parliament of Southern Rhodesia would in any event have topass legislation about the work of the Commission; and he did not think he could persuade his Parliament to enact a provision which would give immunity to oral evidence given in public before the Commission. If the Commission decided to hear evidence in public, he had no doubt that this situation would be exploitedby extremists on both sides. And public feeling throughout the Federation wouldbe inflamed. The Press would lose no opportunity to give publicity, and theposition would become intolerable, if the newspapers were filled with inflammablestatements made in evidence to the Commission. He therefore felt very strongly that any immunity in respect of oral evidence must be restricted to evidencetendered in private. Mr. Macmillan said that Lord Monckton was fully alive tothis difficulty and would certainly prefer that most, if not all, of the evidence shouldbe taken in private. But it was for the Commission themselves to determine theirprocedure: they had not yet met to discuss it: and Lord Monckton might prejudice his position as Chairman if he gave any public indication in advance ofhis own preference for private sessions. Thus, although there was good reasonto suppose that this difficulty would not arise in practice, it was difficult for either government to give assurances about it in advance before the Commission hadassembled. Meanwhile, however, it was evident that some agreed formula mustbe devised as a matter of urgency; for legislation had to be introduced in the parliament of Southern Rhodesia and some statement had also to be made inthe Parliament at Westminster as soon as it reassembled on 26th January.Sir Roy Welensky said that he hoped ifc would be possible to reach agreement ona formula by which immunity would be restricted to oral evidence given in private and written evidence published by or with the authority of the Commission.Mr. Macmillan said that he had telegraphed to London on this subject on theprevious evening: he expected to have a reply in the course of the day: he hopedthat it would then be possible to reach agreement on a suitable form of words.Sir Roy Welensky suggested that it might also be useful, especially in view ofLord Shawcross&apos; remarks, if a joint statement could be made duringMr. Macmillan&apos;s visit about the terms of reference of the Commission.Mr. Macmillan said that he would be referring to this in his speech later that day;and he hoped that what he was proposing to say would have the effect of allayingthe anxieties which were felt in the Federation on this question.The meeting was terminated at this point in order that Mr. Macmillan mightattend a meeting of the Federal Cabinet.Record (made by Federation officials) of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and members of the Federal Cabinet on 19th January, 1960, at 9-50 a.m.Present:Mr. Harold Macmillan Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister ofthe FederationSir Malcolm Barrow, Minister of HomeAffairs and Minister of PowerMr. J. M. Greenfield, Minister of LawMr. J. M. Caldicott, Minister ofEconomic Affairs, Minister ofDefence and Minister for the PublicService
Mr. D. Macintyre, Minister of FinanceMr. F. S. Owen, Minister of commerce and Industry and Minister of PostsMr.   B.   D.   Goldberg,   Minister  ofEducation and Minister of health in attendance:Sir Norman brook mr. M. R. MetcalfMr. D. W. S. hunt mr. M. D. evans mr.. ParryMr. A. J. LambMr. Macmillan explained that the purpose of his visit to the Federation was partly to complete his tour of the Commonwealth and partly to meet people here and gain impressions of the problems facing the Federation. He recognised thatthe period through which the Federation was going was a difficult one but he feltthere was no reason for pessimism and that the aim should be to concentrate onthe strategic object of the Federal concept. He considered that the Federation as awhole would be of great advantage to Central Africa and that it would be tragicif it were destroyed, a situation which could only lead to disorder and disaster.The pessimism relating to the Federation which had developed was, in his opinion,to some extent due to an atmosphere of idealism and support for the underdogwhich was in the make-up of the people of Britain and, on the other hand, to an arrow and selfish view by some people concerned as to what they had got out ofit. Too much emphasis had been placed on the negative aspect of safeguards tothe exclusion of acknowledgment of positive gains. The whole aim should be tomaintain the steady forward progress of the Federation. This in fact was thepurpose of the Monckton Commission which he was confident would provide awealth of accurate information and take an informed view. The membership ofthe Commission was such as should promote confidence. It would in any caseonly be advisory to the Governments concerned and its value would be in creating a background of sensible and sound opinion. Opposition criticism was notimportant as such, but on this occasion it had touched a point on which theconscience of public opinion was sensitive. The Monckton Commission would help to bring it home to public opinion that the concept of Federation not onlyoffered material advantage but was also right and fair. British people liked to feel,not only that they had their feet on the ground but that their eyes were on ahorizon. As part of this concept it was necessary to ensure political advancementfor Nyasaland as rapidly as was practicable in order to make the various constituent parts of the Federation more homogeneous and correct an imbalance which existedbetween them.Sir Roy Welensky referred to the considerable embarrassment which had been caused in the Federation by Lord Shawcross&apos;s statements on television andmentioned that there was a strong feeling that he was no longer a suitable person to serve on the Monckton Commission.Mr. Greenfield referred to Mr. Macmillan&apos;s view that the monckton commission should be trusted, but could not reconcile this with the lack ofconfidence engendered in the Federation by Lord Shawcross&apos;s statements.Mr. Caldicott also referred to Lord Shawcross&apos;s remarks and suggested that,in view of what Mr. Macmillan had been reported as saying in Lagos, there wasneed for a firm statement correcting the position, otherwise the Federation would suffer a dangerous period of doubt and uncertainty.Mr. Macmillan said that what he had said in Lagos had been misreportedand he proposed to take advantage of his address to the National AffairsAssociation to put the matter in perspective. He agreed that the remarks madeby Lord Shawcross were unfortunate, but he was convinced that he had an openmind on this subject and would be a valuable member of the Monckton&apos; Commission. He was confident that the Commission itself would be a source of strength. He hoped that it would hear most of its . evidence in private andarrangements could be made to deal with the problem of publication of evidence.He himself sensed in the United Kingdom a reaction to extreme views andreiterated that good faith was necessary in the operations of the Commission. he felt that one should not underestimate the capacity of the British people to change to a sensible view from an emotional attitude developed by a mixture ofsentimentalism and getting hold of the wrong end of the stick.
Mr. Macintyre said that he was relieved to hear Mr. Macmillan&apos;s assurancesconcerning the Monckton Commission. He drew attention, however, to the need to allay any doubts as to the permanence of the Federation. If there was any impression that the Federal Government was merely a caretaker Government thiswould have serious effects on the.ability of the Federation to raise external loans.Sir Roy Welensky drew Mr. Macmillan&apos;s attention to the statementsconcerning the Federation by Mr. Lyttelton in the House of Commons on24th March, 1953 and the 24th June, 1953.Sir Malcolm Barrow referred to the security position in Nyasaland which he described at extremely delicate. A vacuum had been created since the emergency in early 1959 which had been filled, with the encouragement of the NyasalandGovernment, by the Malawi Congress Party under Orton Chirwa who was, ofcourse, legal adviser to the banned African National Congress. Whatever theMalawi Party may have said at its inception it was quite clear that it did noteschew violence and a situation was buiding up in Nyasaland on the same lines as that before the emergency had been declared. It was understood that therewas to be an accelerated release of detainees: these would reinforce the MalawiParty with militant leadership. In his opinion if Dr. Banda were to be released,even to the United Kingdom, it would not be possible to contain the position in nyasaland since Africans would compare him with Makarios and Nkrumah. Ifthe United Kingdom Government were a party to the release of Dr. Banda,bloodshed would ensue in Nyasaland for which they would have to take responsibility.Mr. Macmillan said that he proposed to discuss the question of the releaseof detainees further with the Governor of Nyasaland and would have theopportunity of further consultations with Sir Roy Welensky on the matter whenhe returned to Salisbury. He was fully alive to the need to create a situation whichwould lead to confidence in the minds of external lenders.Note by Mr. Macmillan of a Meeting with Representatives of the Dominion Partyheld at Salisbury on 19th January, 1960, at 10-30 a.m.The Federal and ^the Southern Rhodesian representatives of the DominionParty came to see me together.I thought Mr. Field more intelligent than his colleague, who was not above&quot; bush &quot; calibre and seemed very young and inexperienced in affairs. He was alsomuch more extreme about Africans.They explained the general idea of the Dominion Party which is to annexethe Copper Belt, the Kariba Dam, &amp;c, and then to hand over to the ColonialOffice the useless parts of Northern Rhodesia, plus, Nyasaland, to administer asthey wished.  This enlarged Southern Rhodesia would then get Dominion status.This seems quite a good idea from their point of view (as they explained it).Yet I doubt if they hold it very seriously. Mr. Field is obviously a man of somepower and intellect. If (which would be a disaster) he obtained power, I daresayhe would improve.Note by Mr. Macmillan of a Conversation with Sir Edgar Whitehead held onWednesday, 20th January, 1960, at 9 a.m.This interview (30-35 minutes) was in two parts.First, Sir Edgar Whitehead said all the things already on the agenda and repeated later, e.g., request for the removal of the reserve powers of the UnitedKingdom Government in respect of African affairs, &amp;c.Secondly, he expressed a good deal of doubt about the future of theFederation although he added that he would not say this to anyone else.He had caused a financial investigation to be made, and he believed that southern Rhodesia .could from this point of view exist quite comfortably asa separate State with a very loose federation or none.About the African problem, he agreed that too little had been done, and too late, on such matters as discrimination. But he was up against the Opposition and(as I would see later at his Cabinet meeting) his own people.  I did see.
Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and Members of the southern rhodesian Cabinet held on 20th January, 1960, at 9 30 a.m.Present:United Kingdom Southern RhodesiaMr. Harold Macmillan Sir Edgar Whitehead, Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia and Minister of native affairs mr. C. J. Hatty, Minister of the treasury and MinesMr. A. E. Abrahamson, Minister ofLabour, Social Welfare and HousingMr. R. M. Cleveland, Minister of LocalGovernment and Native EducationMr. R. Knight, Minister of Justice and internal affairs mr. A. R. W. Stumbles, Minister of roads and Minister of Irrigation andLandsMr. H. J. Quinton, parliamentary secretary to the Minister of NativeAffairsIn attendance:Sir Norman Brook Mr. FairbridgeMr. M. R. MetcalfMr. D. W. S. hunt sir Edgar Whitehead asked Mr. Macmillan if he would make an openingstatement, after which he knew that members of the Cabinet had various questions to put to him.Mr. Macmillan said he was very happy to have a chance of speaking franklyand in confidence to the members of the Cabinet, for the purpose of his visit wasnot to negotiate but to try to learn their point of view. Knowledge of their viewswould give him an invaluable background when questions concerning SouthernRhodesia came to be dealt with in London.Mr. Hatty said that, as the Minister in charge of finance and economic affairs,he was concerned at the lack of confidence in Southern Rhodesia which was nowbecoming evident. There seemed to be a falling off in investment. He could not support this with exact figures; it was based more on personal impressions. be referred to the views of Mr. George Beharrel, Chairman of Dunlop&apos;s, andof one of the leading figures in the Vacuum Oil Company. Things seemed to bestanding still until the Monckton Commission and the Review Conference were out of the way.Mr. Macmillan said that he hoped that his speech of the previous day wouldhave contributed to a restoration of confidence. He thought that the great hope for the Federation, and for Southern Rhodesia, was that, as the standard of living of all the people rose, the internal market would greatly expand.Mr. Abrahamson said he would like to support what Mr. Hatty had said.He thought that industrialists were putting off expanding their plant, and something of the same kind was evident in relation to new housing. One of his particularworries was about African employment. The education of Africans had made such strides that by 1964 there would be annually some 30,000 Africans who had reached standard VI going on to the labour market, and he did not see howemployment could be found for them all. This would only be possible in an expanding economy. Mr. Hatty said that the short-term funds lying with theBuilding Societies had increased  to  a  record and. embarrassing  amount.Sir Edgar Whitehead said that one statistical indication he could give was thatthe total reserves of the Federal banking system had shown a slight decline over thepast 12 months in spite of the fact that the Federation had had a record favourable
trade balance and there had been a lot of official borrowing. He deduced thatthere had been some movement of capital out of the country.Sir Edgar Whitehead said that one of the factors affecting confidence was thelong waiting period before the results of the Monckton Commission and the FederalReview Conference would be known. Mr. Abrahamson and Mr. Stumbles saidthat they for their part had only agreed to the Monckton Commission under strongpersonal pressure from Lord Home, the Commonwealth Secretary, on his visit to salisbury in April.Mr. Quinton said that he had recently had three meetings with farmers in themost prosperous and longest-settled part of Southern Rhodesia. His aim had been to find out whether they would help to relieve the distress which the drought would cause to Africans by taking on extra labour. All the farmers had said that, solong as the state of political uncertainty continued, they could not face increased expenditure or commitments. They had confidence in Southern Rhodesia, but none in the Federation or in the two Northern Territories. Their view was thatthe African majority was being misled by an African minority, the latter numberingmuch less than the total of Europeans. The farmers could see the future clear fortheir own lifetime but they were worried about their children&apos;s future. Some ofthem, including some of the older ones, were saying they would go after the nextcrop. The only thing which would reassure such people would be a clear and positive statement on the future of the Federation, and, because of the need to waitat least until the end of 1960, no such statement could be made.Mr. Stumbles said he was still not quite happy about what the Prime minister had said in his speech about the two Northern Territories. If United Kingdomprotection was not to be withdrawn until these territories were free to decide for themselves, then at that stage they could logically decide to secede from theFederation. Mr. Macmillan said that his statements in Lagos and Salisbury merelyrepeated what he had said in the House of Commons in July and did not go further than what was said in the Preamble to the Constitution. The real reason why theMonckton Commission was essential was that it would have been a hopeless taskto start from scratch on the Constitutional Review Conference without havingpreliminary work done on the facts. He thought that a reaction was alreadybeginning in the United Kingdom against the extreme critical line that had beentaken in some quarters there; when the Commission started working, and he hoped it would work mainly in private, he thought that it would have a good effect in damping down criticism. The Federation existed and could not be broken up.The point he had made at Lagos, and again in his speech to the National AffairsAssociation, was a different one: it was directed to the conditions under whichthe Federation could become an independent country.Mr. Quinton asked about the franchise in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Was it the intention that they should go over to universal suffrage, with ignorantAfricans casting a ballot for one of a set of symbols? If so, Europeans would notbe able to live there, nor would the territories themselves have a chance of stablegovernment. Mr. Hatty said that changes in the constitution of the northern territories would lead to a great strengthening of the demand for the removalof the present restrictions on the Southern Rhodesia constitution. If there couldbe an advance of that sort for Southern Rhodesia it would greatly improveconfidence.Sir Edgar Whitehead said that, if this year merely produced a postponement of the issue; if it resulted in a recommendation for another review, say in five years&apos;time; it would be fatal. There must be finality. Mr. Macmillan asked Sir EdgarWhitehead whether the point he was making was that the Federal ReviewConference should lay down a definite programme, with dates, even if it couldnot, there and then, result in final independence for the Federation? There was general agreement to this formulation.Mr. Macmillan said that account must be taken of public opinion in theUnited Kingdom. It was a part of the British character, a source sometimes of weakness but often of strength, that they had a feeling for the under-dog and wished the policy of their Government to be not merely practicable, and economically advantageous, but also fair and honourable. He would certainlytry on his return to put in a proper light the part which Southern Rhodesia hadplayed and was playing in the Federation.   As he had explained in his speech,SECRET56647 l
the Federation did not arise from an act of aggression by Southern Rhodesia, but from a policy of co-operation and partnership. Meanwhile, people in theFederation must face the facts that to the north of them independent african states were arising and that to the south of them was the Union, whose racialpolicy offered no hope for the future. Between these two spheres of policy theposition of the Federation must inevitably be most difficult. If they could makepartnership work they would be much more secure. He regarded the federation as offering a supreme chance of an honourable, equitable and safe settlement ofthe racial problem.Sir Edgar Whitehead said that there was still friction between SouthernRhodesia and some of the authorities in the two Northern Territories. This was partly due to the different traditions of the two Civil Services. The SouthernRhodesians derived from the liberal tradition of the old Cape Province, beforethe heavy hand of the Afrikander ideology spoilt it. The Coloured Service inthe Northern Territories based their doctrine on the paramountcy of african interests. There was always a temptation for officials in Northern Rhodesia to blame the Federation for anything which was unpopular with the Africans. he mentioned certain specific cases.Mr. Ouinton said that Africans from Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland didnot dislike coming to Southern Rhodesia to work and some Nyasalanders had told him that, if there were an African Government in Nyasaland, they would try to settle more or less permanently in Southern Rhodesia. Mr. Abrahamsonsaid that Southern Rhodesia Africans objected to the Nyasalanders taking theirjobs, and put this down as one of the drawbacks of Federation. Mr. Knightagreed with what the Prime Minister had said about Africans being given theopportunity for political self-expression. But African leaders interpreted this as meaning that they would get the Government into their hands by virtue of universal franchise. He realised the strength of African nationalism throughoutthe continent, but here there was no place for African nationalism, only forRhodesian nationalism.Mr. Macmillan said that a system based on universal franchise was hard towork even in a country with a homogeneous population. It was inherent in anyattempt to have fair representation in a multi-racial State that all races must haveself-expression but there must be no domination by a crude majority. Mr. Knightasked whether, when Mr. Macmillan had spoken about obtaining the views ofall the inhabitants, he had meant that there must be a referendum by universalfranchise. Mr. Macmillan said that he would make a distinction between suchmatters of ultimate significance and the machinery for carrying on the normalbusiness of government. He did not want to say anything about the machineryfor ascertaining the views of the inhabitants. He agreed with Mr. Hatty that the aim must be to get people to think on the lines of Party and not of race.Sir Edgar Whitehead said that, from the point of view of the franchise, SouthernRhodesia now stood roughly where the United Kingdom did after the first reform bill. Mr. Macmillan said that the difference was that in Africa there was heavy pressure from independence movements elsewhere.Mr. Cleveland said that Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland had remainedrelatively undeveloped: the concept seemed to be that of preserving the noblesavage in a sort of national park. In Southern Rhodesia the ideal was that theGovernment should advance all the inhabitants of the country. Mr. Macmillansaid that he could not agree with this. The United Kingdom taxpayer had pouredmoney into the Colonies, even in our times of greatest economic difficulty in thethirties. Mr. Abrahamson said that in the Northern Territories a lot of this moneyhad been misdirected into creating a welfare State rather than in building up a sound basis for economic development. Sir Edgar Whitehead pointed out that southern Rhodesia got no money from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and that when they asked to be allowed to borrow  1 million from the colonial development Corporation this was ruled to be contrary to the Act and there hadto be, further legislation to legalise it. Apart from this contribution, SouthernRhodesians had created the present very high standard of living there by theirown efforts. This year the Government were increasing taxation to meet the rising costs of African education. This money was voted by a European electorate.It was embarrassing that his Government^ responsibilities were so largely limitedto African affairs, because the things in which Europeans were interested were
federal. 12^ per cent, of Southern Rhodesia&apos;s revenue was spent on Africaneducation. The fact that they had thus laid heavy burdens on a Europeanelectorate for the advancement of the Africans was a strong enough argument for removing the reservations in their constitution. He claimed that they couldbe trusted to continue to carry out wisely their responsibility towards Africanswhen the United Kingdom control of this aspect of their affairs was removed.Mr. Macmillan said that he had referred to these great achievements of theSouthern Rhodesian Government in his speech of the day before.Sir Edgar Whitehead thanked Mr. Macmillan for coming and for speaking to him and his colleagues.Record of a Meeting held at Salisbury on 20th January, 1960, at 2 - 45 p.m.Present:United Kingdom Southern RhodesiaMr. Harold Macmillan Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister ofSir Norman Brook the FederationMr. J. M. Greenfield, Minister of law. Anglo-American Talks on AfricaSir Roy Welensky said that he had learned from the Press (the confidentialsupplement to The Economist) that there had recently been some Anglo-Americantalks on Africa. He gathered that one of the conclusions reached was that therewas no immediate Communist threat to Africa. He did not dissent from this conclusion.Mr. Macmillan took this opportunity of summarising the general course of anglo-American relations since 1956 and referred to the intimacy of the contactswhich had now been established, especially on intelligence matters. This particularmeeting had been one of a series in which officials of the two countries exchangedviews on matters of general interest in all parts of the world.Sir Roy Welensky said that he had not raised this matter by way of complaint.2. DefenceSir Roy Welensky said that, after considering the comments which he had had from the United Kingdom Government, he had now come to the conclusion thatit would be unwise to press his earlier suggestion of a regional defence pact forAfrica. He was however disposed to think that it would be wise for the federation to establish closer contacts on defence matters with the Portuguese. He wouldbe glad if Mr. Macmillan would arrange for the United Kingdom Governmentto consider this and let him have their views on it.Mr. Macmillan undertook to consider this question after his return to London.3. Belgian CongoSir Roy Welensky said that Sir Edgar Whitehead was apprehensive about the repercussions in Southern Rhodesia of the constitutional developments which were taking place in the Belgian Congo. He himself doubted whether the immediateconsequences would in fact be very serious. These developments did howeveradd urgency to the problem of road facilities through the Katanga Pedicle. TheGovernment of the Federation would themselves be content with an agreementconferring rights for a term of 50 years, as the Belgians had offered. The view hadbeen taken in London that we should continue to press for rights in perpetuity.Time might, however, be running against us; and he thought it would be wiser to settle this matter quickly on the basis of the Belgian offer.Mr. Macmillan said that he would arrange for the United KingdomGovernment to reconsider this matter on the basis of the views expressed bySir Roy Welensky.
4. Consultation between GovernmentsSir Roy Welensky said that if he or Sir Edgar Whitehead had any consultations with the United Kingdom Government, they always did their best to keep the governors of the two Northern Territories informed. He was sorry to say thatthe same procedure was not always followed in respect of consultations betweenthe United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the two northern territories. For example, a conference on security had recently been held in Kenya,at which the Governments of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland had been represented: he did not suggest that the Governments of the Federation or ofSouthern Rhodesia need necessarily have been invited to send representatives tothis conference, but he thought that they might have been informed of its results.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government certainly had nodeliberate intention to withhold information from the Government of theFederation. In so far as this sort of thing happened, it was not by malice or bypolicy. It must be due partly to the shape of Government organisation in Whitehall there were bound to be occasions on which it was inconvenient that the affairs of the Federation were handled in London by two Departments. The othercause was doubtless the fallibility of human memory things did sometimes tendto get overlooked. He would consider on his return whether any new machinerycould be devised to ensure that the Government of the Federation were kept informed of such dealings between the United Kingdom Government and theGovernments of the two Northern Territories as were of interest to them.5. Monckton Commission: Protection of WitnessesMr. Macmillan said that, in the light of the views expressed at his meeting with sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead on 19th January, he had considered further how it could best be made plain that people would be free to express their views to the Monckton Commission without fear of prosecution. So far as concerned written evidence, a basis of agreement seemed to have been found:it could be publicly stated that no statement made to the Commission in writingwould be used in evidence in any criminal proceedings, provided that words were added to make it plain that this did not apply to the re-publication, without theauthority of the Commission, of written evidence given to it. No difficulty aroseabout oral evidence given to the Commission in private. The only problem nowoutstanding was that of oral evidence given at any public session held by theCommission. Even this difficulty would not arise if, as he believed, the Commissiondecided to take all, or most, of their evidence in private. But, as he had already explained, it would be for the Commission themselves to determine their procedure and Lord Monckton would not be able to say publicly, before the commission had met, that evidence would be taken in private.Sir Roy Welensky said that, if it could be assumed that the Commission wouldin fact take its evidence in private, the problem was solved. It was most important that the Commission should not hold public sessions if witnesses were able touse the sessions of the Commission as a public forum for ventilating extremistviews on either side. One of the main purposes of the Commission would thenbe defeated; for the publicity which would be given to its proceedings in thePress would certainly have the effect of embittering racial relations throughoutthe Federation. Moreover, other difficulties would arise. For, while theGovernments would not themselves be giving evidence to the Commission, theleaders of other political Parties throughout the Federation would certainly be doing so, and it would be embarrassing if they were able by this means to securefull publicity for their views while the Views of the Governments went by default.In these circumstances he suggested that the best course would be for Mr. Macmillanto urge Lord Monckton to do his utmost to persuade the Commission to take all their evidence in private.Mr. Macmillan said that he would certainly be willing to explain toLord Monckton the reasons why it was important in the national interest thatthe Commission should take this course and to urge him to do his utmost to persuade the Commission to follow it. The immediate problem might then bemet by the issue of public statements, by the Attorney-General in each of the three territories, in the following terms:&quot; No statement made to the Commission whether orally or in writingwill be used in evidence in any criminal proceedings.   This does not apply
to statements made by witnesses outside the Commission even if merely inrepetition of oral evidence or republication of written evidence given to theCommission.&quot;Sir Roy Welensky and Mr. Greenfield said that they would support the issueof a statement in these terms, on the understanding that Mr. Macmillan would communicate with Lord Monckton on the lines which he had suggested. Theywould do their utmost to persuade Sir Edgar Whitehead to accept this solutionof the problem. They would at the same time advise him that the legislation relating to the Monckton Commission which had to be passed by the Parliamentof Southern Rhodesia should be restricted to procedural matters and that thisquestion of immunity for witnesses should be handled separately by way of adeclaration by the Attorney-General on the lines proposed.Note. Later on 20th January a verbal message was received from Sir roy welensky to the effect that Sir Edgar Whitehead had accepted the conclusionrecorded in Minute 5 above.Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and Representatives of african opinion in Southern Rhodesia, held in Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s House in salisbury, on Wednesday, 20th January, 1960, at 4 p.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Sir Norman Brook, Mr. D. W. S. Huntand Mr. T. J. Bligh.The representatives of African Opinion in Southern Rhodesia were:Mr. H. W. Chitepo, Mr. N. Shamuyarira, Mr. S. J. T. Samkange, Mr. ChadChipunza, M.P., Mr. Charles Mzingeli, Mr. P. H. Chanetsa, Mr. AidenMwamuka, Mr. J. Madzima, Mr. A. Nyazika, Mr. Lot send a Moyo,Mr. I. Samuriwo, M.P., Dr. Bswarai, M. L. Takawira, Mr. Aaron Jacha,Chief Chinamora, Chief Simon Sigola, Mr. R. M. Bango, Mr. K. G. Dube,Mr. S. Moyo, Mr. M. M. Hove, M.P., Mr. Jairos Jiri, M.B.E., Mr. J. W.Vera, Reverend Willie Segeca, Mr. M. G. Moyo, Mr. J. Z. Gumede,Mr. M. A. Wakatama, Reverend Nemapare, Mr. Makaye and ChiefMukanganwe.Mr. Macmillan said he had come to Africa to learn and he would like those present to tell him their views.Mr. Samkange hoped that Mr. Macmillan would agree to see the NationalDemocratic Party. Mr. Macmillan said this had only been started about three weekspreviously and he had thought it more important to see representatives of the other parties.  Nevertheless, he would note what had been said.Mr. Chitepo referred to the reservations in the Southern Rhodesian constitution,the United Kingdom &quot; reserved rights &quot;. He hoped that the United KingdomGovernment would not surrender these so long as the Southern rhodesian government discriminated against the Africans. Mr. Mzingeli supported this.Mr. Shamuyarira said that the franchise laws, the land laws and the colour bar in southern Rhodesia were discriminatory against the African and until these hadbeen altered he hoped the United Kingdom Government would not allow SouthernRhodesia to become completely self-governing. Mr. Chad Chipunza also thoughtit would be wrong to remove the United Kingdom reserved rights at this stage.Mr. Chitepo said there was a so-called qualitative franchise at present in SouthernRhodesia. This resulted in a Government completely un-representative of thepeople. Rhodesia, like the rest of Africa, was experiencing a surge of nationalism.The present situation could not go on. They must get a Government which wasrepresentative of the majority of the people. It must also be remembered that theSouthern Rhodesian Government had in detention at present eight African political leaders. Mr. Samkange thought the reservations on the constitution could onlygo when the majority of Africans took part in electing a Government. He also thought that there should be in the Southern Rhodesia constitution some sort of bill of Rights. Mr. Shamuyarira said the reservations were very important.Perhaps they could be kept on until there was a Bill of Rights.   At present there
was no right of appeal by Africans against discriminatory measures. They shouldhave written into the constitution the same sort of protection as was written intothe American constitution. Mr. Chitepo added that the Southern rhodesian government could not keep 2\ million people voteless for ever. Mr. Mwamukaagreed.Mr. Macmillan said that it was important to distinguish between the reserve powers of the United Kingdom Government, which were at present under review,and the influence which the United Kingdom Government were able to exercise.On the reserve powers, they had asked for a written expression of the views of theSouthern Rhodesian Government. It should be remembered that in respect ofthe two Northern Territories the United Kingdom Government also had definitepowers, and he had repeated in his speech the previous day the pledges which theUnited Kingdom Government had given not to surrender those powers until thepeople in the territories concerned were willing that this should be done. On theother hand, there were certain things over which the United Kingdom Governmenthad no power, and which they could only alter by using influence. Mr. Chiteposaid that the United Kingdom Government could use its powers indirectly.The Reverend Nemapare hoped Mr. Macmillan would give them then and therean assurance on reserve powers.   Mr. Hove supported this.Mr. Shamuyarira said that when Southern Rhodesia had become a self-governing Colony the United Kingdom Government had relinquished some ofits powers to a Government which was responsible only to a small Europeanminority. The Southern Rhodesian Government was elected by 4 per cent, of theinhabitants and the Federal Government by 1 per cent, of the inhabitants. TheUnited Kingdom Government should not relinquish responsibilities to such small groups. He also pointed out that the Southern Rhodesian memorandum on thereserve powers was being prepared by Europeans. He thought, and Mr. Samkangeagreed, that it would be right for the United Kingdom Government to seek other points of view from Southern Rhodesia when the memorandum was beingconsidered. Mr. Macmillan said that he took note of this point. The ReverendNemapare said that any liberalisation that there might be in Southern Rhodesiawas due indirectly to the fact that the United Kingdom had reserve powers.Mr. Macmillan asked whether on the broader question of discriminationopinion within Southern Rhodesia was moving in the right direction. He ratherthought it was. He thought it important that they should remember that the minor, and possibly most irritating, discriminations were not always the result oflegislation.   Such matters were often not within the powers of Parliament.Mr. Shamuyarira said there were many social discriminations in SouthernRhodesia. The recent immigrants from Europe, especially the women, tended tobe the most arrogant. They called fully-grown African men &quot; boys &quot;, because theydid domestic work, and there were many other pinpricks of this sort. He thoughtthat the social frictions would not disappear until legal discrimination had been removed. Mr. Macmillan suggested that they should take encouragement fromthe new University and the atmosphere of liberality which it encouraged. Mr. Hovesaid that the University was extra-territorial. Mr. Chitepo said the University wasvery good but they could not rely on University education to end discrimination:the pace would be much too slow. Mr. Takawira said that the Government were notgiving a sufficiently good lead in education; more might be done in getting a liberalatmosphere in secondary schools. Mr. Samkange said that the University was unable to stage big occasions as there were not enough lavatories to cope with thedifferent races. He also said that there were many discriminations against africans in Salisbury: for example, all African offices had to be in the native quarter, eventhough there were many African professional men who were working as colleagues with Europeans. Mr. Mwamuka thought that it was the prevalence of racialdiscriminations in Southern Rhodesia which accounted for the African oppositionto the idea of Federation.Mr. Macmillan said that it might be quite a long time before they got to aposition of &quot; one man, one vote &quot;. After all, this had not been realised in theUnited Kingdom until after the 1946 election. In the meantime, there was muchthey might work for. Mr. Mwamuka thought it most important that the federation should not be given Dominion status until social discriminations had been removed.Mr. Macmillan suggested that there were within Southern Rhodesia many
Europeans who were becoming liberal. There was general dissent from this.Mr. Shamuyarira said there was no significant body of liberal opinion in SouthernRhodesia. One had only to see :what had happened to Mr. Garfield Todd.Sir Edgar Whitehead, while he had liberal instincts, was unable to display hisliberalism to the electorate and had to pretend to be reactionary.The discussion then turned to the Monckton Commission. Mr. Shamuyarirasaid that the wrong people had been appointed to the Monckton Commission asthey were mostly Government employees, for example Chief Sigola. Mr. Bangohoped that there would be no interference with the African Affairs Board. He also thought the Africans had confidence in the Labour Party. Mr. Macmillan hopedthat the Commission would do a good job. It was, after all, composed of experienced men of great good will. The Chairman, in particular, was most uprightand conscientious and fair-minded. The Commission would be able to do a betterjob, the more evidence was given to it. They should be told as much as possible ifthey were to be of any help. Mr. Takawira thought that the terms of reference should have allowed the Commission to consider the possibility of secession. TheFederation had already demonstrably failed, as it did not work on a basis ofpartnership. Mr. Macmillan said that the Monckton Commission was advisory.Its task was to find out as much as it could and then tell the Governments, whowere responsible for taking the decisions, what the background was. Mr. Samkangesaid that the bar on the discussion of secession by the Monckton Commission reallymeant that territories within the Federation were like detainees. Mr. Macmillanhoped that everybody would give the Monckton Commission as much help aspossible.Sir Edgar Whitehead then came in to remind the Prime Minister that it wastime to go to his next engagement and the meeting broke up with an exchange ofcourtesies.Record of Conversation Between Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Garfield Todd in salisbury, on Wednesday, 20th January, 1960, at 5-30 p.m.Mr. Macmillan saw Mr. Garfield Todd at the United Kingdom HighCommissioner^ house before the High Commissioner^ Reception.After an exchange of courtesies Mr. Macmillan asked Mr. Todd how he sawthings. Mr. Todd replied that, although he was usually very optimistic, he wasvery pessimistic now. Mr. Macmillan said he thought that much good might be gotfor very little, for example, if people could be got to treat the question who should or should not go into a hotel as one of money and not colour.Mr. Todd said that the trouble in Rhodesia was that concessions were too little,too late and too grudging. He then went on to talk about widening the franchise.Mr. Macmillan observed that even in the United Kingdom the franchise had beenwidened only very gradually. It was true that the concessions had not on the wholebeen regarded by the public as too little or too late, but even in his own youth the franchise had been comparatively narrow in a town of 20,000 people there mighthave been only about 8,000 voters.Mr. Macmillan went on to ask Mr. Todd to refresh his (the Prime Ministers)memory about Mr. Todd&apos;s own Parliamentary career. Mr. Todd did so, tellinghow, when he was Prime Minister, he had had a majority of 26 out of 30, how thatmajority had included Only 7 Liberals, how, so long as they were talking aboutFederation, they stuck together and how they split on the franchise and he went out.Mr. Todd said that he wondered whether, with a view to fostering a non-racialsociety in the Federation, conditions might not be attached to United Kingdom aid for development. He said that this had been done in respect of the United kingdom contribution towards the cost of the University college of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.There followed a discussion of other European territories in Africa, after which mr. Todd said he believed the Federation would succeed. In reply to a question about the franchise he said that the test should be the worth of the individual, not an economic standard: some sort of educational standard should be the test.
Mr. Todd said that he had recently written in an article for publication in theUnited States: &quot; The apparent weakness of Her Majesty&apos;s Government andstrength of the Federal Government will lead to disaster &quot;. He sincerely hoped thattime would give him cause to apologise for it. Mr. Macmillan said that one couldn&apos;t&apos;tget one&apos;s way by hectoring, but there were other means. Mr. Todd remarked thatthere was very little time.Mr. Todd was charming and friendly throughout; but, although his objects areclear enough, his ideas about means seemed woolly and vague.B. Northern RhodesiaRecord of a Meeting of the Executive Council of Northern Rhodesia held at government House, Lusaka, on Thursday, 21st January, 1960, at 10 45 a.m.Present:United kingdom mr. Harold MacmillanSir Norman brook mr. D. W. S. HuntNorthern RhodesiaSir Evelyn Hone, Governor, NorthernRhodesiaThe Hon. R. A. Nicholson, Acting ChiefSecretaryThe Hon. H. J. Roberts, Minister for labour and MinesThe Hon. B. A. Doyle, Attorney-General and Minister for LegalAffairsThe   Hon.   T.   C.   Gardner,   ActingMinister of finance the Hon. M. G.

Malcomson, Ministerof Local  Government  and  SocialWelfareThe Hon. G. M. Musumbulwa, Ministerof African education the Hon. E. M. L. Mwamba, Ministerof African AgricultureMr. J. R. Dinwiddie, Acting ClerkSir Evelyn Hone welcomed Mr. Macmillan on behalf of the Executive Council.They were honoured by his visit to the Federation, and they were particularlypleased that he was travelling to each of its constituent parts. They particularlywelcomed this opportunity for personal discussion with him.The Council had recently been re-constituted: it now contained, for thefirst time, two African members. He was glad to be able to say that it was notdivided into groups, on racial or other grounds: it functioned as a unit with noother consideration than the interests of the country as a whole.Sir Evelyn Hone then invited Mr. Macmillan to address the Council.Mr. Macmillan said that he had not come to negotiate any agreement on theconstitutional issues which now confronted the Federation. His purpose in making this tour through Africa was to see something of the country and its problems,to meet some of the political leaders, and to gain a personal insight which wouldgive him a clearer understanding of the problems which he and his colleagues athome would have to handle after his return.Politicians were now principally occupied with the constitutional problemsof the Federation.   There was some danger that they might exaggerate the
importance of these problems. After all, the real purpose of politicians was soto arrange the affairs of a country as to enable its people to live a happy, prosperousand useful life. In Northern Rhodesia a primary objective of Government policy must be to broaden the basis of the economy, to expand the demand of the home market and to raise the standard of living of the people. For all this a politicaland constitutional framework was certainly required, but it was a mistake to suppose that constitutional reform was an end in itself.Mr. Macmillan said that he would be glad to hear from the Ministers themselvessomething of the problems with which they were faced.The following is a summary of the statements made by members of theCouncil:1. African education the Government were keenly aware of the need to expand educationalfacilities, though the financial resources which could be allotted to this were limited. A number of primary schools had been established, though these didnot yet cover the whole country. A start had been made with secondary education.And training colleges for teachers were also in operation two new colleges hadbeen opened in the last year. These facilities were supplemented by missionschools, which received Government grants and were subject to government control.2. African AgricultureSubsistence-farming was traditional, but active steps were now being takento persuade Africans to grow cash crops. Of these the main crops were maizeand groundnuts, but good progress was being made with a new project for growingTurkish tobacco, for which there was now a good market. It was not easy to persuade Africans to change their traditional habits of farming, but they were showing an increasing readiness to accept Government guidance and advice.The traditional system of land tenure was not well adapted for cash farming.For, having no legal title to their land, Africans could not raise money by mortgageand a special scheme of assistance was needed in order to provide them with thecapital required. A study was also being made of the possibility of introducing a new system of land tenure which would be better suited to cash farming.3. African HousingHigh priority should be given to the provision of better housing accommodation for Africans. A higher housing standard would help to increase home demand and thus broaden the basis of the national economy. It would also make for greater contentment and political stability. An African Housing Board had beenestablished, to which municipalities could go for financial assistance and for advice. The average cost of new housing, with drainage and other services, wasabout  400 per unit. There was also need for larger houses for middle-classAfricans. The factor which limited faster progress was the difficulty of raisingsufficient capital for this purpose. Loans or grants for housing development wouldbe one of the most valuable contributions which the United Kingdom Governmentcould make towards the future prosperity of Northern Rhodesia.Mr. Macmillan said he would be glad if the Governor would let him havea memorandum on the question of housing for Africans.4. LabourLabour relations had been difficult in the past, but there was some hope thatthe position was now improving. There had been no strike in Northern Rhodesiasince October 1958 largely because the attitude of the trade unions had recentlybeen more reasonable.5. Monckton CommissionAnxiety was expressed lest the visit of the Monckton Commission to theFederation should have the effect of inflaming racial feeling. The attitude of africans towards the Commission had been greatly influenced by the refusal ofthe Labour Party in the United Kingdom to co-operate in its work. It was most fortunate that the Labour Party should have taken up such an unhelpful attitude on this question.
Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and Members of the United FederalParty held at Government House, Lusaka, on Thursday, 21st January, 1960,at 11 15 a.m.Present:United kingdom mr. Harold macmillan mr. D. W. S. HuntNorthern RhodesiaMr. H. J. Roberts (Leader and Ministerof Labour and Mines)Mr. G. M. Musumbulwa (Minister of african Education)Mr. SteynMr. BurneyMr. Roberts said that he was the local leader of the Party of which the FederalLeader was Sir Roy Welensky. It was the only Party in Northern Rhodesiawhich had both European and African Ministers in the Government. He wouldlike to ask Mr. Macmillan whether there could be any change in the present formof the Northern Rhodesian Constitution before United Kingdom protection was withdrawn.Mr. Macmillan said that he was sorry that so much stress was being laid now on the negative aspect of not withdrawing protection. The reason for this waspressure, particularly from the Opposition in the United Kingdom. He thoughthe had now made the position of the Government sufficiently clear and he wanted to concentrate on the positive side. The Monckton Commission would be agreat help in relieving this pressure. There must be many ways of ascertainingpopular opinion.Mr. Roberts said that the policy of his Party, which was completely non-racial,was to move forward to the time when the Government would consist wholly of elected Ministers, both European and African. The present official Ministers,though he did not question their capacity or intelligence, were in an anomalousposition. Mr. Macmillan said that what was necessary was to get on with the job and not to waste too much time on theoretical arguments. He hoped thatthese controversies would die down when the Monckton Commission started work, especially as it was likely to sit in camera.Mr. Musumbulwa said that he had been struck by what Mr. Macmillan had said in his Salisbury speech about the relatively advanced standard of education in west Africa. He agreed that this was a vital point to bear in mind when consideringdemands for self-government for Africans in Northern Rhodesia. Here they hadsimply not got enough educated Africans. He himself had been a Minister for12 months now and realised how difficult it was to learn the arts of government.Mr. Macmillan agreed. He said that in an old country, like France, even long periods of bad government could be endured because of the underlying strengthof the country; in a new country, such as those in Africa, it was not safe to makemistakes.Mr. Roberts, in replying to a question, gave an account of the local governmentsystem. He pointed out that the Native Authority Councils should be taken intoaccount, in addition to the Legislative Council, when discussing representativeinstitutions in Northern Rhodesia.Mr. Roberts said that it had been a great mistake to put the Federal capital in Salisbury; it would have been much better placed in Northern Rhodesia.Mr. Roberts said that he agreed whole-heartedly with what Mr. Macmillan had said in his Salisbury speech about Federation giving an example of partnership tothe world. It must be remembered, however, that there were party politicalpressures on the Federal Government and for this reason it would be a great helpif they could have in Northern Rhodesia a more representative government. Hewould like to suggest that there should be a division of subjects between those over which the Federal Government could have full control and those reserved to theUnited Kingdom Government. It was ridiculous, for example, that parliamentary questions could be asked at Westminster about the policy of road building inNorthern Rhodesia.
Mr. Burney said that from the commercial point of view what was neededwas stability. Business men drew the contrast between Southern Rhodesia7 whichhad control of its own affairs, and Northern Rhodesia, where the ultimate controlrested at Westminster. Confidence would come much more easily if there were some provision preventing the United Kingdom Government from legislating for northern Rhodesia.Mr. Macmillan said he hoped that all these points would be put before theMonckton Commission. He thought that the Commission would perform a very useful function. Its purpose was to provide a briefing for all the Governmentsconcerned in the Constitutional Review Conference. Possibly it might not make recommendations but merely set out the issues; but in his experience all conferencesrequired to be well prepared in advance and he could not see how the ConstitutionalReview Conference could come to anything without the preparatory work whichthe Monckton Commission would undertake.Record of a Conversation between Mr. Macmillan and the Central Africa Party,at Government House, Lusaka, on Thursday, 21st January, 1960, at 12 noonSir John Moffat said that he was concerned at the strength of the feeling against federation which was developing in Northern Rhodesia and elsewhere inthe Federation. This was reported by all the branches of the Central Africa Partyin all the territories. Mr. Macmillan asked to which main cause they attributedthis feeling. Sir John Moffat said the attitude of the protected Africans was thattheir political and social progress would be hampered by federation. They differedin this respect from the Africans resident in Southern Rhodesia. Mr. Franklinsaid that the African had believed that he need not be part of the Federation if he did not want to be. Developments were now tending to confirm his fears thatFederation was a way of perpetuating European domination. During the time that the Federation had existed they had not noticed any difference in their economic,social and political life. He thought it fair to say that the hatred of Federation inthe North was nearly pathological. The Africans in Northern Rhodesia were determined not to give way to Sir Roy Welensky and the Federal Party. Thishostility might well lead to a process of passive resistance, strikes and so on,culminating perhaps in a revolutionary movement which could cause bloodshed.Mr. Gondwe said that Mr. Macmillan had come to Northern Rhodesia at anopportune time. He had recently toured his constituency to talk to his peopleabout the Monckton Commission and he had found, wherever he went, that the africans thought of Federation as synonymous with Salisbury and Sir roy welensky. They were indignant at the way things had gone. If Federation hadan economic purpose, there need be no hurry to take irrevocable political steps.The fact that there appeared to be a rush towards implementing Federation madethe Africans even more suspicious. They feared that the Europeans were aimingto create a military State under their domination. In particular his people believedthat the Federation had tried to get Northern Rhodesia away from its status asprotected territory. They also thought that in Southern Rhodesia the federal government were trying to create a South African way of life.Sir John Moffat agreed that the Africans in the Northern Territories fearedvery much that the protection of the United Kingdom Government would be withdrawn. They thought that the Europeans were determined at all costs toexercise supreme political power in the Northern Territories as in SouthernRhodesia. This was why the United Kingdom powers of protection were sounpopular with the Federal Government. It was also their reason for favouring thetermination of the reserved powers in Southern Rhodesia. Sir John Moffat thoughtthat the opportunities to explain Federation had been lost in the early days. Itwas now too late. If one showed an African a hospital and said this was one of thePresent:United kingdom mr. Harold macmillan mr. T. J. BlighSir John MoffatMr. H. FranklinMr. A. H. GondweNorthern Rhodesia
advantages of Federation, he merely became irritated. He thought it was impossible that the political situation could continue as it was at present. They must now try to find some different sort of association which would hold the line until passionshad died away.Mr. Macmillan said Governments of the Territories concerned in theFederation were required under the law to review the position in 1960. They couldnot escape this. The Monckton Commission had been set up to help with this process. It had unfortunately become slightly involved in United Kingdom politicsbut that position had now been cleared up. Africans should realise that theCommission consisted of extremely able men of great good-will. He hoped thatthey would not boycott it. The Commission was purely advisory. Its function wasto brief the Governments for the statutory review. It would be impossible for theGovernments to conduct this review effectively without some such preparation.Sir John Moffat said that he and his party believed in facing the facts inNorthern Rhodesia, however unpleasant these facts were. There was no future inpretending that these facts did not exist.Mr. Macmillan said that there was also some extremist body of opinion in southern Rhodesia which was opposed to the continuance of Federation, but for different reasons.Mr. Franklin said this sprung from Europeans who thought that SouthernRhodesia was losing money by Federation.Sir John Moffat said that the main mistake which Europeans in SouthernRhodesia were making was their refusal to face the fact that the ultimate destinyof Africa was to be ruled by Africans.Mr. Macmillan said that one could state a logical sequence of three possibilities:(a) the Europeans could fight it out;(b) they could all go away;(c) they could try to find some workable machinery that was broadly fair toeverybody and that would not necessarily mean a mere counting of heads.Mr. Franklin said that they could not, even if they wanted to, fight it out inNorthern Rhodesia. It was inevitable that in due course the country would becomelargely dominated by Africans. What they must try and do was to secure that inthe Legislative Assembly there were a few Europeans working for a situation inwhich nobody would care about colour. He added that it sometimes seemed tothem that the United Kingdom Government were afraid of Sir Roy Welensky asthey were always adding a few face-saving words to their pronouncements.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government had powers whichthey could use in certain circumstances. But it was not always easy for them toexercise their influence by lecturing from London. People were not persuaded to change their minds by public protests: they were more effectively influenced by private talks and discussions.Record of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and Members of the Dominion Partyheld at Government House, Lusaka, on Thurday, 21st January, 1960, at 3 p.m.Present:United Kingdom Northern RhodesiaMr. Harold Macmillan Dr. G. smith mr. J. Robertson Hon. G. F. M. Van EedenMr. C. J. W. FlemingMr. C. F. ThatcherMr. Macmillan opened the meeting by welcoming the Dominion Partydelegates and asking them to put their point of view to him.Mr. Van Eeden said that they were grateful to Mr. Macmillan for having cometo the Federation and to Lusaka to listen to all the different views and perhapscriticisms of those whom he would meet.
The view of the Dominion Party was that the Federation would not be ableto continue in its present form without trouble and possibly violence. There was growing uncertainty and insecurity about the future. Many Europeans were leaving the country more than one would think from the official figures. IfEuropeans were to be persuaded to stay in the Federation and, indeed, if moreEuropeans were to be persuaded to settle in the Federation it was vital that theyshould be convinced that their future would be secure. The Dominion Party feltthat changes in the present Federal structure were needed very soon.The Dominion Party were afraid that either the United Kingdom government might feel, or the Monckton Commission might recommend, that it was necessaryto go ahead with African political advancement at an excessive speed. Nobodywanted to keep the African down, but different people had different ideas aboutthe speed at which his advancement should take place. It was very difficult togauge African opinion correctly. Indeed, the opinions of Africans differed very greatly from one area to another. Africans were now subject to external influences,by no means always healthy, and it was unrealistic to talk of &quot; African opinion &quot;in the Federation as a whole.It was probably true that at present most Africans would say, if asked, thatthey were opposed to Federation. But this need not necessarily mean that the concept of Federation should be abandoned. Admittedly, it was necessary toconsider African opinion but it would be a mistake to give undue weight to it.For example, most Africans now seemed to be antagonistic to the Federal PrimeMinister personally. That was not his fault, but it was a fact, and it meant thatAfricans would automatically suspect any constitutional proposals which wereassociated with him. This sort of illogical factor must be borne in mind whenassessing the weight of African opinion.The policy of the Dominion Party was set out in their proposals for a central african alliance. They envisaged Dominion status for Southern Rhodesia, togetherwith the European-settled areas of Northern Rhodesia, and continuance of UnitedKingdom protection and administration over Nyasaland and the predominantlyAfrican areas in Northern Rhodesia. These proposals had received a considerable measure of support from Europeans and Africans alike. The Dominion Partydid not see how independence for the whole Federation could ever be acceptable to the people of Nyasaland. The Dominion Party supported Sir Roy Welenskyin his demands for independence but thought it more realistic to seek independencefor a unit smaller than the whole of the existing Federation. They would be puttingtheir proposals before the Monckton Commission.Mr. Fleming then said that in his view a democratic constitution on the westminster model would not work with Africans. The chances of its workingwere even less in places where Europeans and Africans lived side by side. So faras he knew, the only successful democracies were those in countries with ahomogeneous population, with the possible exception of Switzerland. In rhodesia and Nyasaland the important thing was to find some way of preventing Europeansfrom dominating Africans and vice versa. The answer to this problem was, he&apos;thought, to give the greatest possible measure of self-government to the differentcomponent parts of thecountry.Mr. Van Eeden said that the Dominion Party also suggested that there shouldbe an Upper House to take the place of the African Affairs Board and to hold thebalance between the different racial communities. Mr. Macmillan mentioned thatin the United States the Supreme Court had played an important function inenabling a number of different States to grow together into one nation.Mr. Fleming agreed that American political concepts might provide useful modelsfor Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He remained convinced, however, that Africanswould always stand for block voting on racial lines and that the Europeans wouldalso be likely to do the same.Mr. Thatcher then asked about the terms of reference of the monckton commission. There seemed to be a difference of opinion between Sir Roy Welenskyand Lord Shawcross on the question how widely these could be interpreted.Mr. Macmillan replied that it would be for the Monckton Commission to interpretits terms of reference. But the Commission^ purpose was to give a clear picture of the situation rather than to recommend what decisions should be taken by theGovernments concerned.   It would be for the United Kingdom Government and
the other Governments concerned to take decisions about the future of theFederation after the Monckton Commission had reported.Mr. Fleming then asked what people in the United Kingdom felt about central africa. He had the impression that even Conservative backbenchers were now beginning to lose confidence in their own leaders who had formulated the plan for federation. In reply Mr. Macmillan said that the British people had many goodqualities: they had a lot of common sense, but they also had a quick symapathy for the under-dog. If they were to be brought to accept any particular solution ofthe problems of Central Africa, they would have to be persuaded that it was bothpractical and morally right.Mr. Macmillan concluded the meeting by saying that he thought it important that the Europeans in Central Africa should try to get the advanced Africans onto their side. He said that in his view the small irritants arising out of discriminatory practices were as great an obstacle to this as the large constitutional and political questions.Record of a Meeting with Representatives of the African National Congress heldat Government House, Lusaka, on 21st January, 1960, at 3-30 p.m.Mr. Macmillan (accompanied by Sir Norman Brook) met the followingrepresentatives of the African National Congress:Mr. H. M. Nkumbula, M.L.C.Mr. J. M. MicheloMr. W. JereMr. E. MilamboMr. Nkumbula referred to the memorandum which he had already submitted.He then proceeded to make the following points orally:(1) In 1958 the Congress had sent a petition to the Colonial Secretary asking for a new constitution for Northern Rhodesia. They were dissatisfied with the existing constitution because it did not give enoughopportunity for Africans to share in the government of the country.They wished to have a constitution based on the principle ofgovernment by consent of the people. They believed that theGovernment should be elected by a majority of the population as awhole under a universal franchise.(2) As regards the Federal constitution, the Congress had no objection inprinciple to the appointment of a preparatory commission as aforerunner to the 1960 Review- They had, however, various criticisms of the Monckton Commission. They were dissatisfied with its composition, because they thought that the proportion of Africans toEuropeans was too small: parity of representation, as between Africansand Europeans, would have captured African imagination throughoutthe Federation. Secondly, the terms of reference were too narrow toallow African witnesses to express their opposition to the principleof Federation. Thirdly, they thought that the African members ofthe Commission were not well chosen. Only one was capable of expressing the view of the majority of Africans in the Federation:the remainder were all known to be supporters of Federation.Unless these defects in the Commission could be remedied theywould not feel able to co-operate in its work.(3) The African population of the three Territories was opposed to Federation.They believed that it was introduced in order to thwart the aspirations of Africans to self-government and independence. The Europeans hadevidently made up their minds to stay in Rhodesia and to rule thecountry. The Congress had no objection to their staying but theycould not be expected to agree that a European minority should
continue to dominate the country. The Congress must continue to oppose Federation because it could do nothing to help the cause of african nationalism.(4) The Congress demanded an educational programme which would providea sufficient number of educated Africans to run the administrative services of Northern Rhodesia.Mr. Macmillan said that he was glad to have had this opportunity of hearing the point of view of the African National Congress. He had noted the points which the delegation had made and would bear them in mind. They would not expect him to give any detailed reply. He would however like to explain thepurpose and functions of the Monckton Commission. In doing so he stressed thefact that the work of the Commission would be preparatory and that theresponsibility for final decisions would rest with Governments. He also referredto the impartiality of the Chairman and the qualities of the United kingdom representatives on the Commission: these were all men of goodwill who could be trusted to deal with this problem in good faith. In conclusion he said that he hopedthat, in view of what he had said about the Commission, the Congress wouldre-consider its present inclination to decline to co-operate in its work. He had himself been interested to hear their point of view. He would see that it was communicated to the Commission: but it would be preferable that they should submit it to the Commission directly and in full and he hoped that, on furtherreflection, they would decide to give evidence to the Commission.Note of a Meeting between Mr. Macmillan and the Paramount Chief ofBarotseland, held at Government House, Lusaka, on Thursday, 21st January,1960, at 4 p.m.Present:United Kingdom Northern RhodesiaMr. Harold Macmillan The Paramount Chief of Barotseland,Sir Evelyn Hone Sir Mwanawina LewanikaMr. G. C. R. Clay (Resident-Commis-   The Ngambela, Imasikusioner in Barotseland) Induna KatemaMr. D. W. S. Hunt Induna KalongaMr. Macmillan said he was very happy to welcome the Paramount Chief ofBarotseland, his Prime Minister and Counsellors. He remembered seeing the paramount Chief at the Coronation where he specially took note of his uniform. he hoped that they would put to him frankly the points they wished to raise.The Paramount Chief said that the Ngambela would speak for him. TheNgambela spoke in Barotse through the interpretation of Induna Katema. Afterthanking the Prime Minister for visiting Northern Rhodesia in spite of his onerousduties, and begging him to present their loyalty and devotion to Her majesty the Queen, he produced a petition which he handed to the Prime Minister (copyannexed) saying that it was a shorter version of one which had already been sentto the Colonial Secretary. Mr. Macmillan thanked the Ngambela and read the petition. He said this was plainly something that required to be studied carefully.However he would give now his first impressions on the three points made in the petition.(i) The United Kingdom Government quite understood the Barotse&apos;s desireto remain as a separate protectorate under the protection ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government. He undertook that their views would be fully taken into account.(ii) He was interested in the suggestion that Barotseland should be shown onmaps as a separate territory. It was a new point to him and he wouldhave it studied.
(iii) He took note of the desire of the Barotse to have the rights and privilegesflowing from the 1900 Treaty of Protection clearly codified. he understood that such a codification was being undertaken by theColonial Secretary.Sir Evelyn Hone said that he had received a long memorandum from theColonial Office which was designed as a basis for what the Paramount Chief had requested. Mr. Clay explained that some of the original treaties with the Barotsewere in non-legal language, and some of the copies in the possession of the Barotsenation had been damaged or mislaid in the course of time. A codification wasplainly desirable. Doubt had crept in about the precise legal status of Barotselandbecause of the changes which had taken place when the administering authority on the spot had changed from the British South Africa Company to the Governmentof North-Western Rhodesia, then to the Government of Northern Rhodesia, and,most recently, when Federation was set up.Mr. Macmillan thanked the Paramount Chief of Barotseland, the Ngambelaand Counsellors, for coming to see him. He promised that the three points, whichhe recapitulated, would be most carefully considered.The Barotseland National Council and the nation itself during its last annualmeeting in September 1959 reaffirmed its conclusions written down in itsMemorandum of September 1958 submitted to the Secretary of State for theColonies, that if and when Dominion Status comes to the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland and /or Self-Government comes to Northern Rhodesia, Barotselandshould remain separate as a full Protectorate under the Protection of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment as petitioned for by the late Paramount Chief or King Lewanika toHer Late Majesty Queen Victoria.The Barotseland National Council further feels that the Status of Barotselandas a Protectorate is rather obscure and therefore they petition that Barotselandshould be declared and distinctly defined on Maps like other Protectorates thoughattached to Northern Rhodesia. This declaration should be certified and signed by one of Her Majesty&apos;s Responsible Ministers.The Barotseland National Council considers that certain rights and privilegescontained in its Agreement and Treaty of 1900 with the British South AfricaCompany on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government have been lessened by theintroduction of the Native Courts and Native Authority Ordinances and we request that these rights and privileges should be considered and restored.The Barotseland National Council strongly recommends that, for ease and convenience of reference, it is of the utmost importance that the rights, privileges and assurances reserved to the Barotse Government and Nation in the variousscattered agreements, concessions, letters and records should be compiled together in one document certified by Government.Record of a Meeting Between Mr. Macmillan and Representatives of VariousAfrican Organisations, held at Government House, Lusaka, on Thursday,21st January, 1960, at 4 30 p.m.Barotseland Protectorate Status with regard to 1960Constitutional ChangesPresent:United KingdomNorthern RhodesiaMr. Harold MacmillanSir Evelyn HomeMr. T. J. BlighMr. Lakement NganduMr. S. M. MunungaMr. K. MulondaMr. W. NkanzaMr. S. H. ChilesheMr. S. TemboMr. K. KaundaMr. M. Chona
Mr. Ngandu thanked the Prime Minister for seeing the independent membersof the Legislative Council. He himself would like to see independence for the africans in Northern Rhodesia. They had been happy under British rule but theydid not like the Federation. Promises had not been kept. He was grateful to thePrime Minister for the speech he made in Salisbury, especially for repeating the pledges of the United Kingdom Government. If that Government thought the africans were not yet ready for independence they must not withdraw their protection. The African must be given a chance to learn how to govern himself and given a chance to educate his children. It would be helpful if there were more secondary schools.Mr. Mununga said that the independent members of the Legislative council had consulted the Africans in their constituencies, who represented half thepopulation of Northern Rhodesia. They could find no support anywhere for federation. All their people would like to see it dissolved. The Federal set-upwas slowing down the political and economic development of the Africans. Therehad been a deterioration in racial relations. Without Federation the Europeanswould be prepared to treat Africans as human beings, but with Federation run bySouthern Rhodesia the Europeans would continue to show no respect to Africans.Turning to territorial problems Mr. Ngandu said that there should be moreAfricans on the Legislative Council. He then registered a strong protest againstthe composition of the Monckton Commission. He said the letter of protest from northern Rhodesia had been ignored. There were seven million Africans and300,000 Europeans in the three territories. The Commission should have theconfidence of the majority of the people.Mr. Mulonda supported the arguments of the first two speakers. The Africanshad disliked Federation from the first and had said so in 1953. Then they were told their fears were unfounded. After seven years they could say that their fearswere justified. Federation had brought oppressive legislation. If they spoke inthe Legislative Council they were protected. If they spoke outside their speecheswere put on a tape-recorder and this was oppressive. He did not demand amajority of Africans right away but thought that the pace should be quickened.Every African wanted to break out of the Federation.Mr. Nkanza said that Africans in Northern Rhodesia were confident that theywould be protected by the United Kingdom Government. They were glad thatMr. Macmillan had repeated, in his speech at Salisbury, the pledges given by theUnited Kingdom Government. He hoped that Mr. Macmillan would understandthat it was not just a handful of Africans who were against Federation: allAfricans throughout Northern Rhodesia were against it. They were suspicious ofthe Federal Government^ scheme for Dominion status and they hoped the UnitedKingdom Government would continue to look after them. They might one dayask for independence: they were confident in the light of recent history that theUnited Kingdom Government would grant this.Mr. Chile she agreed with the previous speakers. The United KingdomGovernment had come to Northern Rhodesia to teach and guide the Africans tothe day when they could control their own country. But from 1948 there had been some change in the general mood and soon after the London Conference the africans began to feel anxious. Then came 1953. The Africans saw this as a transfer of power from the United Kingdom to Europeans in the Federation andthe continuance of the Federation would mean that power would always reside inthe Europeans within it. He hoped that the United Kingdom Government wouldnot forget their original purpose. They must remember that once protection was handed over it would be difficult to recapture. The dislike of the Africans for theFederation was based on their fear that promises would not be fulfilled. he hoped the United Kingdom Government would not regard their attitude asungrateful. They liked the United Kingdom Government and wanted to stayunder their protection. They had been told there would be economic advantage from Federation but Northern Rhodesia was in fact suffering economically andthere had been no development of the social services.Mr. Tembo said that the majority of Northern Rhodesians wished federation to end as they were suffering under it socially. There were many other thingsthan the Kariba Dam on which money might usefully be spent in Northern
Rhodesia. For example they wanted more schools. He would prefer that politicaldevelopments should follow social and economic developments.Mr. Kaunda said that the main problem in Northern Rhodesia was that powerresided in the minority group. That was the root cause of the trouble. Was this because the Europeans felt insecure? The whole country was divided betweenblack and white, politically, socially and economically. It was therefore hollowto speak of partnership. It would have been better if Mr. Macmillan could havebeen entertained in African homes. This was considered impossible because powerresided in the minority. His Party were not wild men: they simply believed in therights of all men. For example they thought it wrong for the Governor to have so much power in Northern Rhodesia and this was not in any way a personalreflection on His Excellency, of whom they were very fond. He thought all these problems could be answered by a peaceful transfer of power to the majority inthe country.Mr. Chona said that Mr. Macmillan, if he looked round the table, would beable to see those who were described as moderates, namely, the independent members of the Legislative Council, and those who were described as extremists,such as himself. Was there any noticeable difference between them? Bothmoderates and so-called extremists said the same thing, that the Federation washated by the African people. He too was glad the Prime Minister had referredto the United Kingdom&apos;s pledges in his Salisbury speech. It sometimes surprisedhim that people thought it wrong of Northern Rhodesians to want to stay under british protection. They trusted the United Kingdom Government to carry out its duty to lead its Colonies to self-government. The Africans in Northern Rhodesiawere not different from the Africans in West Africa, except that they had lesseducational facilities. Proud as they were to be protected, by the United KingdomGovernment they hoped they would be treated in the same way as the WestAfricans. One solution would be accelerate education. Then people would beable to choose who should speak for them. He too was grateful that the PrimeMinister had been well treated by the people with whom he had stayed. It wouldhave been impossible for him to come to an African compound. He would beashamed to show the Prime Minister his hut. If they were an independent countrythey would always be ready to welcome the United Kingdom Prime Minister. he asked the Prime Minister to note their views on Nyasaland and Kenya. Dr. Bandawas liked by the Nyasas, although not perhaps by the settlers. Why could not they let him go?Mr. Macmillan thanked the speakers for coming and for talking to him withcourtesy and moderation. He had gained in experience by hearing what they hadto say. He hoped they would not mind if he made a few comments.Federation was meant to be a co-operative way of existence between three territories. It might or might not be a good thing. It looked as if it might workin Nigeria. It seemed to him that the objection to it in Rhodesia was not an objection of principle but an objection to certain consequences which might flow from it. As they knew from the speech which he made in Salisbury and what hehad said in Lagos, the Northern Territories would not be included in a completelyindependent Federation, unless their people expressed their wish for this, andhe had made it clear in the House of Commons that a Legislative Council couldnot be regarded as a final judge of what the people&apos;s wishes were.On the Monckton Commission he said he was most anxious that this should get to work as soon as possible. All the Governments concerned had to meet atthe end of the year. He could not see how a sensible solution could be reached at this conference without proper preparation. The main purpose of the monckton commission, which consisted of men of great good-will and good faith, was toundertake this preparatory work for the Governments concerned. He hoped thatthey would all feel able to give their views to the Monckton Commission.On the broader question Mr. Macmillan said that in Northern Rhodesiathere were many races and many tribes. This made the problem more difficult.One had to get some sort of unity of purpose in the hearts and minds of all thepeople. He hoped they would as soon as possible try to get some party system which cut across racial lines. There were other parts of the Commonwealth wherethere were similar problems, for example in Malaya and Singapore, and these were being overcome.
C. NyasalandRecord of a Meeting of the Executive Council of Nyasaland held at government house, Zomba, on Monday, 25th January, 1960, at 2 p.m.Present:NyasalandSir  Robert   Armitage,   Governor   ofNyasalandMr. C. W. F. Footman, Chief secretary mr. R. M. M. King, Attorney-GeneralMr. H. E. I. Phillips, Financial SecretaryNominated Official Members Mr. R. W. Kettlewell, Secretary forNatural ResourcesMr. J. H. Ingham, Secretary for LocalGovernment and Social ServicesNominated Unofficial Members Mr. A. C. W. DixOnMr. M. H. BlackwoodMr. E. M. MtawaliMr. C. M. ChinkondenjiMr. P. A. Richardson, ClerkAfter a preliminary exchange of courtesies, Sir Robert Armitage said that theExecutive Council had identified three particular subjects which they wished todiscuss with Mr. Macmillan (i) the expansion of African education in Nyasaland,(ii) the future of the public services in Nyasaland, and (iii) development finance.Brief memoranda on each of these subjects had been prepared in order to facilitatediscussion.  These are reproduced as annexes to this record.1. African EducationMr. Ingham spoke in amplification of the memorandum reproduced in annex A. Present plans contemplated that 50 per cent, of the African population would receive five years&apos; primary education and that, of these, about 20 per cent,would pass on to secondary schools. In Nyasaland secondary education had laggedfar behind what had been achieved in other territories: it was not until 1942 thatthe first secondary school was opened. About 14 per cent, of the availablerevenues of Nyasaland was allotted to education, but little had been spent hithertoon technical training. Throughout the Federation there was a great demand for people with some technical training. It must now be a primary objective of educational policy in Nyasaland to concentrate on secondary and technical education in order to provide the numbers of qualified Africans required in theyears to come both for administration and for industry. Given the money andthe staff, this could be achieved. But it must be recognised that, for many years to come, the teaching staff would have to be drawn almost entirely from outsideNyasaland. This, in turn, meant that there must be a sufficient prospect of stability in Nyasaland to induce people to come out and give their services there.2. Future of Public ServicesMr. Footman spoke in amplification of the memorandum reproduced in annex B.In discussion of this memorandum the following points were made:(a) Mr. Dixon said that the fundamental difficulty lay in the lack of any sense of security, due to uncertainty about the political prospects of Nyasaland.   If itwere possible to build up a prospect of political stability over a period of ten orfifteen years, all these difficulties would be solved.United kingdom mr. Harold macmillan mr. M. R. MetcalfSir Norman Brook
In this connexion Mr. Blackwood said that it was specially important thatpoliticians should avoid making statements about the future which were ambiguous.Whatever had to be said should be stated clearly and unequivocally: otherwise itwould be misunderstood, especially by Africans.(b) Mr. Footman said that a sense of security was specially important for the recruitment of expatriate officers to a career service. He believed that the solutionlay in broadening the area of service, so that recruits could look forward to a lifecareer of service in one part or another of the Civil Services of the Crown. without some measure of interchangeability, he did not see how people could continueto be recruited for career service in territories like Nyasaland. It was suggestedthat opposition to the creation of such a wider service had come from the british treasury. In reply to this Mr. Macmillan said that decisions on such matters were taken, not by Treasury officials, but by Ministers. He went on to explain, withillustrative figures, the extent of the financial assistance which the United KingdomGovernment had made available to Colonial territories since the end of the war.He also referred to the size of the national debt, and the level of taxation, in theUnited Kingdom and to the fact that financial aid to the Colonies could be providedonly from savings.(c) Sir Robert Armitage said that, in view of the difficulties of recruiting forcareer service in the Colonies, it was now essential that means should be found of employing people to serve for only part of their career in such places as Nyasaland,as was suggested in paragraph 4(b) of the memorandum. Mr. Macmillan said thatthe United Kingdom Government were now considering means by which people with various qualifications teachers, doctors and technicians of all kinds couldbe enabled more easily to spend a relatively short period of service in colonial territories. The main problem was to provide an assurance that, after a period ofservice overseas, they would be able to resume their career in their profession inthe United Kingdom.(d) Mr. King said that this was particularly necessary in the legal services.He believed that the methods of recruitment followed by the Colonial Office were out of date. From personal enquiries which he had made he was confident that by other means solicitors or barristers could be induced to give a few years&apos; service in Colonial territories. The Law Society and the Bar Council had ample funds attheir disposal and ought to be able to help such people to resume their careers onreturn to the United Kingdom. He admitted, in reply to a question byMr. Macmillan, that it might be easier to make such arrangements in respect ofsolicitors; but, for his part, he believed that the legal services in the Coloniescould be staffed as well by solicitors as by barristers.(e) There was already in Nyasaland a local civil service open only to personsborn in Africa; and this could be extended as time went on. The difficulties inconnexion with this would have been less if a unified civil service had been instituted from the outset for the Federation as a whole.Mr. Macmillan, summing up this part of the discussion, said that three thingsseemed to be required:(i) An assurance of political stability for the Federation and its constituentterritories for the next 10-15 years.(ii) Increased recruitment of local people, within the Federation, for the postswhich they were qualified to fill.(iii) As regards expatriate officers, further consideration of the possibility of &apos;(a) broadening the base of the career service, and (b) enabling people to accept short-term contracts for short periods of service overseaswith a better assurance of being able to resume their careers thereafterin the United Kingdom.In regard to (iii) he suspected that there were better prospects of advance under(b) than under (a).3. Development FinanceMr. Phillips spoke in amplification of the memorandum reproduced in Annex C.He said that he and his colleagues on the Executive Council were grateful for allthe financial assistance which the United Kingdom had extended to Nyasalandsince the end of the war.  They also realised the financial and economic benefit
which they derived from their membership of the Federation. Finally, theyappreciated that the availability of funds from the United Kingdom for developmentof the oversea territories of the Commonwealth must depend on the level of savings in the United Kingdom over and above those required for domesticcapital development. What they were less sure about was (a) whether the means for making public funds available for export to other Commonwealth countries were as well adapted to this purpose as they might be; and (b) whether more money would be made available for this purpose from the private sector if itwere not for fears about the ultimate security of the capital invested.On (b) the Government of Nyasaland had already suggested that the Bankof England and the City should together devise a scheme for spreading, by insurance,the risks, of providing capital for a territory moving towards independence. there might also be a need, in addition, to improve the conditions of dependent-territoryloans floated on the London market, possibly by some form of preferential tax relief.As regards (a), they strongly urged that, if the volume of savings did not justify an increase in the total amount available for investment in under-developed countries overseas, further thought should be given to the scope and functions ofthe Colonial Development Corporation. Its terms of reference might be amended so as to require it to invest in schemes which could only fructify in the long term.Alternatively, its scope might be restricted and funds which would otherwise be allocated to it should be made available directly to Governments.The main need of Nyasaland was for loans on easy terms especially with along moratorium on repayment of capital. In theory this need could be met bythe International Development Association which was now under consideration.There was, however, some room for doubt whether this Association would infact do what it was designed to do; whether it would have enough funds at its disposal; and whether a sufficient proportion of its funds would be available for commonwealth countries. If the United Kingdom Government shared these doubts, they might well consider withdrawing some or all of their proposedinvestment in this Association so as to enable them to create a new fund of theirown to supply &quot; soft&quot; loans directly to Commonwealth countries.If Nyasaland was to generate its own wealth, its needs for development financecould not be over-stated. At present the Government could not meet theirrecurrent commitments from their annual revenues, let alone increase thosecommitments as they should. They were in fact dipping into their reserves, whichwould be exhausted in about two years. They must not only maintain theirpresent position in the Federal fiscal system; they must also obtain a greater shareof Federal revenues and they must seek additional taxation powers on their own account. It was estimated that, when existing reserves were exhausted, at leastanother  1 million a year would be required to maintain existing services, to expand agricultural and educational services, and to provide additional cover for the borrowing of more money for capital development. Nyasaland could nolonger follow the traditional doctrine of spending no more than its annualresources. It must spend more than that, in order to increase those resources.It followed that it needed financial assistance and this must be given generouslyand promptly, rather than piecemeal over a long period.Mr. Macmillan thanked Mr. Phillips for this lucid exposition of Nyasaland&apos;financial problem. He said that the people of the United Kingdom were anxiousto help. More would have been done already, if so much time had not been lost in the 20 years of the 20th century which had been spent in war and the world economic slump. As a result we were now working against time. But the will to help was there; and, if the British economy could be kept on a sound basis,the means would be available.4. Political Prospects of FederationMr. Macmillan said that he would be glad to hear how the Executive Councilviewed the political future of Nyasaland and of the Federation.Mr. Dixon said that what was urgently needed was a fixed programme of constitutional change which would enable Africans to assume an increasing share in government. No good could come of trying to move too fast, out of panic-that would bring administrative chaos and, ultimately, the economic ruin of all
of the Central and East African territories. At present there would be no profitin discussing constitutional change with the main African parties: the policies to which they were committed were impracticable because there were not sufficientAfricans with enough training to take over full responsibility for government.Until there were enough qualified Africans to do this, government must remainin responsible hands. It would, however, be possible to prepare a programme,acceptable to moderate African opinion, which would provide for a gradualtransfer of responsibility to Africans over a period of 10-15 years. The futureof Nyasaland lay in some form of federation with Northern and Southern Rhodesia.The programme of constitutional advance must therefore be settled in consultationwith the Governments of those territories and of the United Kingdom, and itmust be guaranteed by them all. By this means it should be possible to securethe prospect of stability without which none of the other difficulties discussedunder earlier items of the agenda could be solved.Mr. Chinkondenji said that at the present time Africans in the Federationwere disturbed by fears including fears of one another. No progress could bemade until these were removed. In Nyasaland the Africans looked to the UnitedKingdom Government to provide them with the training which they needed before they could assume a greater share of responsibility for the government of theircountry. The urgent need was for more trained Africans. The majority of africans in Nyasaland wanted to look forward to the day when they could assume the main responsibility for the government of their country within an independentFederation. At that stage representation in the Legislative Council and theExecutive Council would be determined, racially, according to the proportions ofthe total population. The majority of Africans in Nyasaland were anxious toco-operate with their European friends in the territory.Mr. Macmillan said that he was glad to have had the opportunity of hearing the views of members of the Executive Council on this question.
Annex AAFRICAN EDUCATIONAL EXPANSION IN NYASALAND1. Rapid progress towards responsible Government in Nyasaland necessitatesa considerable acceleration of African education to provide a reasonable numberof persons who can be expected to undertake responsible positions in theGovernment, industry, commerce and the professions. Provision is made at presentin the Civil Service alone for more than 400 professional officers.2. The existing African education development plan covering the next fouryears, 1959-63, the capital cost of which is  850,000, is the most that can be done with existing or promised financial resources including the CD. &amp; W. allocation.It provides for an expansion plan at all levels which will take us one short stage further on the road towards providing primary education for all children and willexpand the secondary system to an extent sufficient to give an estimated out-turnof school certificate passes which rises steadily from about 80 at the end of 1960to 260 per annum at the end of 1964.3. The out-turn at school certificate level is regarded as the key because thisis the first level at which access opens directly on to positions of modestresponsibility and is the reservoir from which the supply of candidates for further education is drawn to specialist and professional courses, to higher school certificateand university entrance. The number obtaining university degrees from the existingexpansion programme should be about four graduates per annum at the end of1966, rising to 12 or 13 per annum at the end of 1970.4. On the basis of our present plan for primary education which it would be exceedingly difficult to expand, the greatest realistic acceleration of output whichcould be aimed at would be a doubling of the planned output of school certificatepasses by the end of 1965; and for this we show below the staff and finance required.5. It is essential that development in technical education and artisan training should go hand in hand with development in secondary education. Industry inthe Federation is expanding and so are the artisan training facilities provided forAfricans in the other two territories. The Nyasaland African will lose his traditionalrole of supplying much of the semi-skilled labour to industry throughout theFederation unless our plans for technical education and artisan training are greatlyexpanded.6. To carry out the above proposals, the additional finance needed wouldbe of the order of  1  million capital expenditure spread over the next five yearsand additional recurrent expenditure amounting to a further  380,000 per annumby the end of the expansion period. The additional expatriate professional staffneeded would be about 125.7. In regard to staff, the considerations set out in the paper on the futureof the public service apply. The number given in paragraph 6 of this paper isadditional to the numbers required for existing plans and to fill existing vacancies.The additional finance is, of course, required in the form of grants since the return from its expenditure is both long term and indirect.23rd January, I960.
Annex BTHE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC service. Responsible government demands the availability of a civil service staffedlargely by local officers. Without the staff to run the government machine,responsible government-or indeed any form of government is impossible.2. Even if standards were lowered, nothing which approached the nucleus of a locally staffed senior service would be available in Nyasaland for severaldecades. That this is so may, inter alia, be demonstrated by the fact that thepresent expanded education programme can only hope to produce about fourgraduates in 1966, rising to 12 graduates in 1970.3. Although some progress has been made in furtherance of the jointannouncement in 1957 by the United Kingdom Government and the federal government that locally based civil services should be developed, little progress has been made in the matter of interchangeability. Recruitment from outsidethe Federation will therefore continue to be essential to Nyasaland for aconsiderable time to come. Expatriate officers are and will continue to be requiredto ensure that the government machine continues to run, to provide the basicessential services and to enable the essential training of local candidates for higherappointments to proceed. In the present circumstances they are not forthcoming.Thus, to take a single example, the Education Department has 26 immediatevacancies in the senior section of the Service out of an establishment of 54, witha possibility of four further vacancies and only one recruit in view.4. It is therefore clear that special measures will be required to fill a gapwhich, far from closing, is steadily widening through a failure to attract suitablerecruits and through losses of existing staff. It is represented that the best hopeof achieving this object is to be found in taking the following steps:(a) To provide for the integration of H.M.0.CS. with those United KingdomServices from which Her Majesty&apos;s Government staff their overseas posts;(b) To produce and implement plans which will provide for a regular and comprehensive series of professional and administrative secondmentsfrom the United Kingdom Civil Service, coupled with effectivearrangements whereby persons can be seconded from LocalGovernment and even industry in the United Kingdom without lossof superannuation benefits or detriment to career prospects in theirparent service;(c) To fill gaps which cannot be filled as above by specialists under a ColomboPlan type of assistance for routine Government appointments and notonly for appointments in connexion with particular projects.5. If these steps are not taken the situation will continue to deteriorate until a stage is reached where it is impossible to provide even in attenuated form theservices which the people of a territory have a right to expect and where thegovernment administrative machine will cease to function with even a modicumof efficiency. This is a realistic appreciation of a situation which will inevitablymaterialise if nothing is done to remedy the facts as they are to-day.6. The steps proposed in this paper provide, it is suggested, the most likelymeans by which the territory&apos;s requirements of qualified professional andadministrative staff could be met and by which it might be possible both to attractsuitable career officers and to stem present losses to the service of valuable young officers who see no secure or attractive career in H.M.O.C.S. as at present constituted. In the context of the existing situation it is relevant to observe thatagainst an indent for nine Administrative Cadets in 1959, the Colonial Office were only able to provide one recruit.7. So far as the Technical and Executive grades are concerned, it will benecessary to turn to a system of improved and competitive contract terms. It willbe appreciated that contract terms will not attract the type of career officer requiredfor the professional and administrative services.23rd January, 1960.
Annex CDEVELOPMENT FINANCE1. Financing of development in under-developed countries such as Nyasaland,relying for its prosperity mainly on agricultural activity, presents serious problems.2. Notwithstanding the substantial subsidy which the Nyasaland Governmentreceives as a result of its association with the two Rhodesias, notwithstanding thefact that its association with the wider economy makes possible the borrowing offer more money than /was ever possible before Federation and notwithstanding theadditional assistance which has been given over the past few years from her majesty&apos;s Government by way of CD. &amp; W. grants, the level of productivity ofthe great majority of the population of Nyasaland is insufficient to generateGovernment income sufficient for the expansion of basic services.3. If, therefore, the Territory is to do more than merely sustain the existing level of Government services and if it is to maintain and improve the level of public investment, and so attract further private investment, it is necessary, quite apartfrom the maintenance of some form of Federal association (which for the purposeof this paper is pre-supposed), for further injections of external capital to be madeavailable and for this capital to be made available on easy terms.4. The most important manifestation of both the difficulty and the necessityis in the provision of agricultural services. It is clearly of first importance, and theJack Report has recently underlined this, that the potential of the AgriculturalDepartment should be greatly increased by the provision of both staff andequipment to enable it to perform its vital function of providing day-to-dayservices for farmers to increase the productivity of the agricultural industry. no more internal resources are available for this without undesirable retrenchmentsin other fields of development but at the same time it would be clearly wrong touse money attracting high rates of interest and immediate capital repayments, evenif it could be readily secured, for services of this nature which can produce no immediate economic or fiscal return. Nor can this country afford to borrow large sums of money at high rates of interest for general development, whatever its nature.5. The most beneficial aid would be much larger allocations of CD. &amp; W.funds. As far as this territory is concerned, it has done well to have secured 3 million under the current CD. &amp; W. Act; but it understands that, having regardto other commitments, it cannot get more unless and until the total amount madeavailable by the United Kingdom Parliament has been increased; or until it hasexpended or nearly expended its current allocation, whereupon some redistributionmay be possible.  More is certainly needed.6. What is also needed is a source of funds which can be made available oneasy terms such as, for example, on an interest-free basis in the early years, or witha substantial moratorium on capital repayments, perhaps up to as much as 10 years,or a combination of both.7. Existing United Kingdom and international lending agencies do not generally meet these needs since, although modest deferments of loan redemptionand interest can sometimes be arranged, all lending is intended to be on a fullyeconomic basis. This greatly restricts the Governments ability tp call on theseagencies, because what is needed in Nyasaland is an injection of capital fordevelopments which can be expected ultimately to produce revenue, but whichcannot be carried by the Government on recurrent account at economic rates until they have generated not only sufficient income to service the capital employed, butalso to pay for the recurrent cost of the expanded services needed for their maintenance.8. It is true that the International Bank is now engaged upon constituting anInternational Development Association which is intended to supply this kind ofmoney. On the other hand, certain American attitudes which have come to notice in recent months suggest that the ultimate organisation may not be in a positionto achieve the effect which its original architects desired.
9. Whether or not however the International Development Association does,in the event, achieve this effect, it is already clear that the demand for the fundsat its disposal will very much exceed the amount likely to be available for allunder-developed countries both within and without the Commonwealth. more over it may well be that dependent Territories will be expected to look to the mother country rather than to the Association.10. It is accordingly urged that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should considersetting up an organisation which would seek to carry out the objects to which reference has been made above in respect of the under-developed dependent territories of the Commonwealth. In this connexion, the Colonial development corporation as at present constituted is in no position to meet the needs, and theproposals in the Sinclair Report on the Colonial Development Corporation, evenif implemented, may not in the event materially alter this position. Quite apartfrom this, it is not always desirable, and sometimes not practicable, that theColonial Development Corporation should themselves carry out development projects and where it would seem more appropriate for the Governments ownagencies to carry out these projects, a source of loan funds on easy terms isnecessary.11. A further problem with which this Territory is faced is that certain privateinvestors would be happy to provide loan capital for specific development projectsif only they could be assured that eventual transfers of political power would notdestroy the value of the asset thus created or, worse, lead to a default in the repayment of capital. On more than one occasion a request has been made thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government should be approached to provide a guarantee orotherwise to underwrite a loan of this nature. This, understandably, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is not prepared to do; but it is suggested for consideration that theBank of England and the City of London generally should be asked to considerwhether such lending might not, within limits, be considered an insurable risk and,by some process of underwriting willing lenders, make it possible for them toprovide finance with little or no risk to the principal monies involved.12. This paper is not concerned with ordinary market borrowing. In so faras the Territory can afford to borrow it still has access, through the agency of theFederal Government, to the money markets of the world; and any shortcomingson the London market can be made good, in all or in part, by Exchequer loans.13. But the Territory in fact cannot continue to borrow large sums at marketrates for general development purposes as distinct from immediately revenue-earning projects. It is in this respect that its needs must be met, and met soon,either by further free grants from CD. &amp; W. funds or else by loans on very easyterms from an organisation which it is now proposed should be set up andcapitalised by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.23rd January, 1960.
Record of a Meeting with a Delegation from the Malawi Party held at government house, Zomba, on Monday, 25th January, 1960, at 3 15 p.m.After an exchange of courtesies Mr. Orton Chirwa referred to the memorandum which had been submitted to the Prime Minister by the Malawi Congress Partydelegation51-&apos;. Apart from Mr. Chirwa the other speakers were Mr. Ngwiri, whospoke as the Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, and Mr. Mwale, who spokeas a villager and an ex-detainee.  The main points that emerged were as follows:1. State of EmergencyThe delegation claimed that the situation in Nyasaland had been quiet forsome time. They considered that the State of Emergency should now be ended andthe detainees released. It would be very difficult to solve the constitutional problems which confronted Nyasaland while Dr. Banda was still in prison. The NyasalandGovernment were not justified in claiming that two-thirds of the detainees hadbeen freed, for many of them were still required to stay in their villages and thispenalised, not only the man, but his wife and family also. Reference wasmade to the fact that a State training institution and a school of agriculture had beenturned into a detention camp and a prison. So long as these institutions were soused no technicians or skilled agricultural workers were being trained in them:they should revert to their proper purpose as soon as possible.2. The Territorial constitution the delegation said that they had no confidence in the present constitution of nyasaland and no faith in its Government. There should be a new constitutionwith elections based on full adult suffrage. In this way, Nyasaland could get aGovernment that commanded the people&apos;s confidence. Was it necessary that everyProtectorate should follow the pattern of emergency and imprisonment before independence was granted? It should be possible to talk things over at a round-table conference.Mr. Chirwa said that there had been a very mild demonstration when mr. Macmillan had arrived, with people showing placards, and yet six had been arrested by the police. Mr. Macmillan said he would look into this.3. The Federal constitution the delegation argued that the people of Nyasaland had never wantedfederation. The whole idea was basically wrong; and, as it was not accepted bythe people, their leaders could not take part in any machinery designed to makeit work more effectively. It was not characteristic of British methods to try tocontinue a system against the will of the people. It was this more than anything else which had caused a breakdown of confidence in the United KingdomGovernment. It was easier to see objections to the Federation if one had been ina prison in Southern Rhodesia. Opposition to federation should not be taken to imply any sense of personal grudge by the Nyasas against Europeans. They wantedEuropeans to live in Nyasaland, not as masters, but as friends. Nyasaland wasnot a Colony but a Protectorate and this meant that the interests of the indigenouspopulation should be put above those of the non-indigenous. The Nyasas hadprotested against federation since 1953 and it could be argued that the UnitedKingdom Government had not honoured the treaty of protection in the letter.4. The Monckton commission the Malawi Party had decided after careful and anxious study that they couldnot co-operate with the Monckton Commission. They thought it was wrong incomposition and in terms of reference. Moreover its purpose was to advise thefive Governments concerned, and as one of these Governments did not command the confidence of the people it was doomed to failure. It would certainly not beable to carry out its work while Dr. Banda remained in detention. Would it notbe possible for Mr. Macmillan, on his first visit to Nyasaland, to secure as a gesture of good-will the release of all the detainees?Present:United kingdom mr. Harold macmillan mr. T. J.

Mr. Macmillan thanked the members of the delegation for coming to see him.He had come to visit Nyasaland to see things for himself and to try to get a betterpicture of the situation when he was considering in London the problems withwhich the United Kingdom Government had to deal. He was not here to negotiate.He undertook to consider the points which had been put to him both orally and inthe memorandum.  He would like to make the following comments:(a) The United Kingdom Government did not like declaring a State ofEmergency, but the first duty of any Government was to protect thesecurity of the people and at times the ordinary processes of the lawhad to be set aside, as indeed the United Kingdom Government had done in Britain during the war. It was their earnest desire to get rid of the State of Emergency as soon as possible.(b) The United Kingdom Government hoped for constitutional advance in nyasaland but there were of course other advances than theimmediate introduction of universal adult suffrage. The UnitedKingdom Government had to consider their duty. In the countries forwhich they were responsible their task was gradually to develop asystem of local self-government. In some countries this process wasslower than in others, but it was not a process that could be short-circuited. There had first to be a Civil Service, an educational system,a proper police force, and so on. He could not promise anything definiteabout Nyasaland but he could say that the United KingdomGovernment hoped that there would be an advance. The British recordwas very good and there were two recent examples in Africa namelyGhana and Nigeria which should encourage the Malawi Party tohave some faith in the good intentions of the United KingdomGovernment.Mr. Macmillan thought the terms of reference of the monckton commission were fairly wide and should give scope for everyone to advance their point of view. The Governments concerned were undera statutory duty to hold a review in 1960. This was not a matter whichcould easily be carried out without a great deal of preparatory work.The Monckton Commission was meant to carry out that work. Hevery much hoped that the Malawi Party would see fit to give theirviews to the Monckton Commission.It was a great sorrow to the British people that federation had given rise to so many suspicions. There were many problems whichcould more effectively be tackled within a federation than if the territories stood independently. The Malawi Party had said that the disadvantages outweighed the advantages, but these latter should notlightly be set aside. They should remember that it would be possiblefor Nyasaland to make its own constitutional advance within theFederation, and also remember that the United Kingdom Governmenthad on a number of occasions repeated the pledges contained in the preamble to the Federal Constitution.After the main statement, Mr. Orton Chirwa asked whether Mr. Macmillanwould not agree to see Dr. Banda. Mr. Macmillan said he was sure they wouldunderstand that he could not answer that question. Mr. Orton Chirwa then arguedrather more emotionally than in his opening statement. He said that the time for constitutional advance had gone. He hoped that Mr. Macmillan, who wasultimately responsible for what happened in Nyasaland, would see that the Federalstructure was hindering its progress. It worried him that the United KingdomGovernment were frightened of Sir Roy Welensky. The people in England didnot seem worried about the peoples in Africa. Surely they had other obligationsthan to Southern Rhodesia. It was not right that they should have delayedconstitutional progress in Nyasaland for the last 70 years.Mr. Macmillan hoped that the Malawi Party would keep open minds on thewhole position and would try to have more faith in the United KingdomGovernment. The British people were not easily frightened: they would carry out,in good faith, what they conceived to be their duty. He had listened carefully towhat the delegation had said and he promised he would bear it in mind when considering the problems that had to be solved in the future.
AnnexMALAWI CONGRESS PARTY DELEGATIONMemorandumThe Party has submitted to the Prime Minister a Memorandum, the text ofwhich is sef out below together with suggested lines of reply.&quot; IntroductionIt is not often that a Prime Minister visits any of the Protectorates andthis is certainly the first time that a Prime Minister in office has ever visitedNyasaland. Normally, all Africans should be rejoicing and giving you thewelcome that befits your high office. The African people of Nyasaland are,however, unable to give you that welcome which you received in Nigeria andGhana for the following reasons :(a) that many Africans including Dr. H. Kamazu Banda and other leadersare in prison without trial;(b) that there is in the country a state of emergency whereby normalsocial and political activities are restricted;(c) that ordinary human rights and freedom of movement, publicgatherings, speech and self-determination are thereby denied toAfricans and hundreds of people recently released from detentioncamps and prisons are heavily restricted;(d) that the Africans have no say in the present Nyasaland Governmentand are not happy with the present Interim Constitution and haveno confidence in any of the members nominated to the legislative and Executive Councils;(e) that the existence of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasalandagainst the known opposition of the Africans is the one singlecause of all the frustration, bitterness, resentment andmisunderstanding between Government and people.It is therefore not so much to welcome you to Nyasaland but, unfortunately,to register the protest of the mass of the African people of Nyasaland for thepresent unhappy state of affairs in the land that we come to meet you. the african people of Nyasaland earnestly request you to use your influence tobring to an end the sufferings and privations of the people.&quot;Suggested Sense of reply the Prime Minister might say that he notes the delegation^ protest that heis here to learn at first hand the many problems which face the territory that if his visit might in some way assist to produce a climate of thought which would lead to a more speedy resolution of these problems, then he would be more thancontent. For the rest, the points made in this paragraph are further elaboratedin succeeding paragraphs of the memorandum and are commented on below.&quot;2. The State of Emergency and Release of DetaineesThe African people demand the end of the state of emergency whosecontinued existence cannot any longer be justified in view of the fact that thecountry has returned to normal and quiet. Under the state of emergencythere are still about 400 people still in detention camps and prisons withouttrial; hundreds who have been released are under control and restriction orders,making it hard for them to live ordinary lives as human beings. Publicpolitical meetings are banned despite the fact that under the ordinary lawthe Police have enormous powers of control of assemblies. It is felt byAfricans that these powers are being used to forestall African demands for self-Government and Secession from the Central African Federation and thatthey should be retained until the Federation has been entrenched.The African people feel that the continued detention of Dr. KamuzuBanda and all the other leaders is unjustifiably calculated , to deprive the
Africans of effective leadership. They have therefore resolved that there canbe no progress in constitutional and other matters until Dr. Banda and allother leaders are released and permitted to come and lead Nyasaland toSelf-government and Independence outside the present unacceptableFederation &quot;.Suggested Sense of reply the State of Emergency must necessarily remain until the Governor is satisfiedthat the point of time has been reached when the powers provided by theEmergency Regulations can be abandoned without endangering public order. Thisis the sole criterion. It may appear that the territory is normal and quiet. what has to be judged, however, is whether this is so because of the powers now exercised under Emergency legislation and, conversely, whether this would continueto be so if the powers were abandoned. This is a matter which involves theevaluation of many factors and possibilities. States of Emergency do not springforth full blown in one day, nor do they die in one day. It is of course theGovernor^ hope, as it is the hope of us all, that the time when the Emergencycan be brought to an end will be speedily reached.Detention, Control Orders, bans on public meetings are among the manyunhappy but necessary consequences which attend the outbreak of violentdisturbances and unconstitutional acts necessitating the declaration of a State ofEmergency. They are designed to safeguard life and property and to secure thepeace.  They are never lightly imposed nor can they be lightly cast aside.It is quite untrue to maintain that these powers are imposed to defeat legitimatepublic aims. Public order is the sole consideration.As to detainees, it has already been found possible to accelerate the rate of release. The position regarding Dr. Banda and all other detainees however is thatthey will be released when the Governor is satisfied that they can be released in circumstances which will not endanger the maintenance of public order.&quot; 3. FederationYou are no doubt aware from your reading of the Devlin Commission andother reports that the African people of Nyasaland are intractably opposed tothe Central African Federation and will not agree to any political association with Southern Rhodesia. Your Government imposed this scheme on thiscountry against the unanimous opposition of Africans in 1953. Since thentheir worst fears have been confirmed by events in Central Africa and by theutterances and demands of white settlers for dominion status. There can nowbe no doubt that your Government is determined to assist the white settlersagainst the Africans by the use of troops under the state of emergency. TheMalawi Congress Party has the mandate to state that, whatever happens,Nyasaland Africans are determined to secede from the Federation now and re-assert their right to self-determination Self-government and independence NOW.&quot;Suggested Sense of ReplyFederation was introduced because Her Majesty&apos;s Government felt satisfiedthat it provided for an association of the three territories which would be in thebest interests of the inhabitants of the Protectorate. To the extent that this is so,Her Majesty&apos;s Government, in introducing it, acted in fulfilment of its paramountduty to protect and advance the interests and welfare of the peoples of Nyasaland.The object of Federation is to bring about the association of the two Rhodesiasand Nyasaland within the framework of a constitution designed to conduce tothe security, advancement and welfare of all their inhabitants, and to fosterpartnership and co-operation between those inhabitants. These are laudable andessentially Christian objects which have been misrepresented in many quarters.As to secession from the Federation, it is to be borne in mind that, at present,the peoples of Nyasaland enjoy free access to the Rhodesias to seek employment.Without Federation this could be very different. There would be no obligation on the part of the Rhodesias to make special arrangements for the Nyasas to entertheir territories in search of work. The Nyasa might well find himself cut off fromthis source of gainful occupation. Something like 170,000 Nyasa males are nowin employment outside the Protecorate. About 70,000 move every year out of and
enter into the Protectorate in search of and returning from work. These figures show the extent to which the Nyasa is dependent on getting employment elsewherethan in his own country. His opportunities for employment in the Union arebeing restricted considerably. If this happened elsewhere for any reason it wouldbe disastrous for him.It is a matter for concern that none of those who oppose Federation have everattempted to explain this to their people or to explain what would follow secessionand the consequent restriction of financial resources. There would be less and less money to be spent by the Government. Inevitably, this would mean fewerschools for African children and even now it is only some 50 to 60 per cent, of african children who get an opportunity to learn to read and write and do sums.There would be fewer beds in hospitals, fewer dispensaries and less drugs. Theroads would deteriorate. There would be fewer advisory services to help the progressive farmer with his crops or with his stock. No opponent of the Federationappears to have told the Africans in the villages that this is the price that theywould have to pay if they prefer what they describe as &quot; freedom&quot; to thealternative status of regional autonomy within the Federation. The truth is thatthe road away from an association between the territories leads to ignorance andwant for the peoples of Nyasaland. To suggest otherwise is to mislead the people and those who do so would have a heavy price to pay should they get their way and be required to fulfil the promises they have made for a bright future outsideFederation.&quot; 4. The Monckton CommissionAfricans have no confidence in the Monckton Commission and we havedecided to boycott it for the following reasons :(a) Composition. Most of the members of the Monckton commission are biased in favour of settlers and the Federation. The Africanpeople who have been appointed to it are on the whole Government&quot; men &quot;.(b) Terms of Reference. You  have failed to  assure us that theCommission can have the power and is empowered to recommendsecession in our case. Instead you have insisted that theCommission shall work within the framework of Federation and recommend as to the means of achieving its aims and objects. Thepeople of Nyasaland are not interested in the further continuanceof Federation and feel that no useful purpose can be served in evengiving evidence to a Commission which is so loaded as to entrenchFederation for good.(c) State of Emergency and Dr. Banda. We believe that the first dutyof the Government is to restore confidence in Nyasaland byreleasing Dr. Banda and all other leaders to enable them to come and assist in any future plans for the country. The coming of theMonckton Commission to Nyasaland in the absence of Dr. Bandaand other leaders is very much resented by Africans as a meansof side-tracking him and stabbing him in the back. They wantDr. Banda to come and lead them in all these matters. the concession that Dr. Banda and other detained leaders may give evidence to the Commission is regarded by Africans as a mockery,for Dr. Banda and others would feel unable to speak for the people from prisons and detention camps. They will want to be free andspeak as freemen.id) The Nyasaland Constitution. As the Monckton Commission is setup to advise the five Governments, we feel that no useful purpose would be served by giving evidence to a Commission that is toadvise the Five Governments in which we have no confidence.Before we give evidence to this commission we would require aGovernment in Nyasaland that was representative of Africans.&quot;Suggested Sense of reply as to the composition of the Commission, it is a Commission of individuals.They are not appointed as representatives of particular interests but are chosenbecause they cover a wide field of individual experience.  They represent on the
Commission nobody but themselves. It is quite untrue to suggest that &quot; most ofthe members . . . are biased in favour of settlers and the Federation &quot;. those members of the Commission who come from outside the Federation have no biasof any sort. They are completely impartial. As to the members of the Commissionwho come from within the Federation, they are persons of differing personalviewpoints but they enjoy in common a wide experience of the situation in theFederation and, as is illustrated by their acceptance of appointment to theCommission, a desire to find a just solution to the problems with which theCommission are required to deal. It is only reasonable that persons of this natureshould have a voice in the Commission^ deliberations.As to the terms of reference of the Commission, the Prime Minister has made it clear in the House of Commons that the Commission is in no way inhibitedeither as regards the substance of the evidence to which they are competent to listen, or the substance of their report, in particular with regard to the redistribution of functions and the form of association best suited to any changes.The question of whether Dr. Banda and other detainees will give evidence before the Monckton Commission is a matter for them. Should they wish to doso, arrangements will be made accordingly. If they have strong feelings on theproblems with which the Commission are required to deal, then it would seem wiseof and desirable for them to take advantage of the forthcoming visit of theCommission to make their views known to it.As to the bearing of the present Nyasaland Constitution on this matter, african members enjoy a majority on the unofficial side of the Nyasaland Legislature andto the extent that this is so it would seem inaccurate to imply that the Governmentis unrepresentative of Africans. *&quot;5. Constitutional ReformsAfricans have no confidence in the present Nyasaland Government andespecially in the Interim Constitution. The present members of legislative and Executive Councils do not command the confidence of the people.Because of this lack of confidence in the Government of the country, therecan be no economic and social constitutional progress. Political stability soessential to economic progress and development is lacking and overseasinvestors will not invest capital in the land. The answer is the immediatecreation of a Government in which Africans will have the fullest possibleconfidence. We propose the following: African majority in both theLegislative and Executive Councils and immediate elections based on an adultuniversal franchise roll.&quot;Suggested Sense of Reply-It is accepted that the present Constitution is no more than an interim one andthe Nyasaland Government is most anxious that circumstances should developwhich would facilitate, peaceful and profitable discussion on the matter of the next stage of territorial constitutional advancement. As soon as circumstances permit the peaceful discussion of plans to this end, such discussions will proceed.&quot; 6. Other matters the Malawi Congress Party has the support of the majority of Africanchiefs and people of Nyasaland. We append hereto a Memorandum preparedfor Malawi Congress Party by the Nyasaland Trade Union Congress for submission to you in the hope that you will use your influence to help resolvethese trade union problems in the country. The Malawi Congress Partyendorses the Memorandum and supports every word expressed therein.&quot;(Not reproduced in this print.)Suggested Sense of reply the Prime Minister has already received the original memorandum preparedby the Nyasaland Trades Union Congress and will be replying to that Congressseparately.
Record of a Meeting with a Delegation from the Congress Liberation Partyheld at Government House, Zomba, on Monday, 25th January, 1960, at 4 p.m.Present:United Kingdom NyasalandMr. Harold Macmillan Mr. T. D. T. BandaMr. D. W. S. Hunt Mr. H. F. FaramengaMr. C. W. G. KaluwaMr. P. M. BandaMr. Y. M. L. ChirwaMr. F. KamwanaMr. Macmillan thanked Mr. T. D. T. Banda for the Party&apos;s memorandum,which is reproduced in the Annex to this record. He promised to have this studied.He asked whether the delegation wished to add orally to what was in thememorandum.Mr. Banda was the sole speaker for the delegation. In the course of his address he made the following points :(1) The Congress Liberation Party stood for national unity and against racial hatred. It based itself on the tradition of friendly relations betweenthe United Kingdom and Nyasaland, cemented by Nyasaland&apos;sparticipation in both wars. The Party was not opposed to lawfulauthority, but stood for the development of African self-government.(2) The creation of the Federation marked a victory of the Southern Rhodesianpoliticians over the sound liberal instincts of British statesmen. TheNyasas regarded it as involving the extension to their country of thoseSouthern Rhodesian practices to which they objected when they went to work there. Support for secession was universal in Nyasaland. TheParty stood both for secession and for immediate self-government.When Africans assumed power in Nyasaland they would remainfriendly towards the United Kingdom. They were ready to assureboth European and Asian settlers of the security of their land rights.(3) The principal argument used in support of Federation was the economicbenefit thereby conferred on Nyasaland. Mr. Banda was doubtful about this; for example, Federation had meant that the Shire project was not proceeded with. At the present moment there was severeunemployment in the Blantyre area. He was convinced that Nyasalandcould very well stand on its own feet because the United kingdom would look after it. In any case, he believed that Nyasaland had great potentialities which had not been developed. For example, theycould grow quite a lot of rice. If farming were mechanised, output would be increased. Mr. Banda produced a small glass jar which, hesaid, contained beryllium. This was at present only used in ceramicsbut, with the help of British science, it could no doubt be exploited to greater purpose.(4) His Party was ready to co-operate with the Monckton Commission. Hewould give evidence to the Commission in favour of the secession of nyasaland from the Federation. A detailed statement was already in preparation.Mr. Macmillan thanked Mr. Banda for his statement. The United KingdomGovernment were also anxious to promote constitutional advance in Nyasaland.His own view was that federation was at least an honest project conceived in the belief that by the co-operation of the three territories greater strength would accrue to all of them. He congratulated the C.L.P. on its statesmanlike decisionto co-operate with the Monckton Commission. He had known Lord Moncktonfor very many years, and Mr. Banda would find him a straightforward man and ashrewd Chairman. As for the development of the potentialities of Nyasaland, theUnited Kingdom Government were anxious to do all they could. It was perhapstrue that they had not done enough in the past, but it must be remembered that,out of his own lifetime, 10 years had been wasted in two wars, and after the firstwar there had been an economic depression which had inhibited development.Mr. Macmillan told the delegation that he was grateful for the candour and the friendly tone of their representations. He asked them to believe that the UnitedKingdom Government would act with good will and with good faith in seeking asolution of their problems.
AnnexCONGRESS  LIBERATION  PARTY  DELEGATIONMemorandumThe following sets out the text of a memorandum submitted to the PrimeMinister by the Party, together with suggested lines for reply.&quot; introduction the Congress Liberation Party wholeheartedly welcomes you to thiscountry. You are the first British Prime Minister to visit this Protectoratewhich has always been loyal to the British Crown. We hope that, thoughyour stay in the Protectorate will be a matter of hours, much will be gathered,and a solution Sought to Sad unrest which had enveloped the Protectorate,and that peace and good relations between the Nyasaland Government andthe African people, and also between Non-Africans and Africans Communitiesbe restored.&quot;Suggested Sense of ReplyIt is the Prime Ministers earnest hope, as it must be the hope of all men of goodwill, that a speedy solution will be found to the difficult problems which face the Protectorate. Such a solution can only be found if all sections of the communityshare a willingness to compromise, a sympathetic understanding of each other&apos;spoints of view, a desire for constructive discussion under peaceful conditions andan intention to co-operate with each other. The Prime Minister is here to learnwhat he can of Nyasaland&apos;s problems at first hand and if his visit should also assist in producing a climate of opinion conducive to their solution, nothing would give him greater pleasure.&quot; FederationA great deal of memoranda have previously been submitted on Federationof Central Africa, and it will therefore not be necessary to repeat all what we,our chiefs and other political bodies had said.  We will briefly state our case.It will be recalled that Federation of Central Africa was imposed againstthe overwhelming opposition of the African people to the scheme. TheBritish Government had been misled in the belief that with glaring &apos; economic benefits &apos; which would flow after Federation, and with implementation of&apos; Partnership&apos;, African opposition would naturally decline, and before reviewof the Federal Constitution completely disappear. The African Chiefs andtheir people, on the other hand, assured the British Government that thesettlers&apos; Government of Southern Rhodesia would never allow sufficientfunds for adequate economic growth of the Protectorate, and that&apos; Partnership &apos; would never be implemented in Central Africa.They also mentioned that the main reason for setting Federation wasnot based on economic benefits, but on political grounds to maintain WhiteSupremacy. The British Government believed what the white settlers said and thus imposed Federation on the unwilling loyal Africans of Nyasaland.Since the inception of Federation race relations had deteriorated gravely.We are pleased that time and events have proved Africans right, and as aresult of intensified opposition to Federation, the unrest in the country, andthe untold misery, starvation to several people and economic position of thecountry is almost bankrupt, resulting in unemployment, and lack of expansion in essential human development Partnership Policy for 10 years has failedto be implemented.Secession from federation the case for Secession from Federation was actively made on 1st January,1958, when the Africans decided to draw up a petition which was to be presented to the British Government. We now believe that as the Europeanshave totally rejected partnership everywhere, both the British Government
and Federal Government will firmly work out a solution for letting Nyasalandquit this difficult combination of the three territories. Whilst on this point of secession, we should refer you to what Sir Jock Campbell, Chairman ofBooker Group of Companies in London wrote recently stating a clear case that Nyasaland was completely different to Rhodesia and urged the BritishGovernment to declare the country an African State. Whatever may be ourlot outside the Central African Federation, we have no intention to stand onour Own Without British Guidance, Co-operation and Protection.&quot;Suggested Sense of ReplyFederation was introduced because Her Majesty&apos;s Government felt satisfiedthat it provided for an association of the three territories which would be in thebest interests of the inhabitants of the Protectorate. To the extent that this is so,Her Majesty&apos;s Government, in introducing it, acted in fulfilment of its paramountduty to protect and advance the interests and welfare of the peoples of Nyasaland.The object of Federation is to bring about the association of the two Rhodesiasand Nyasaland within the framework of a constitution designed to conduce tothe security, advancement and welfare of all their inhabitants, and to fosterpartnership and co-operation between those inhabitants. These are laudable andessentially Christian objects which have been misrepresented in many quarters.The financial benefits, economic improvements and the rise of standards ofliving which the Federation has brought about, cannot be gainsaid, they are matters of fact. To take but one example, the Nyasaland and Federal Governmentsbetween them are now spending nearly four times the amount on education and health services than was possible before Federation, notwithstanding the fact thatthe revenue derived from this territory has increased by no more than two-thirdsover the same period. Some people have persuaded themselves that these advantages would have accrued in any case, but such an opinion is not founded on fact.As to secession from the Federation, it is to be borne in mind that, at present,the peoples of Nyasaland enjoy free access to the Rhodesias to seek employment.Without Federation this could be very different. There would be no obligation onthe part of the Rhodesias to make special arrangement for the Nyasas to entertheir territories in search of work. The Nyasa might well find himself cut off fromthis source of gainful occupation. Something like 170,000 Nyasa males are nowin employment outside the Protectorate. About 70,000 more every year go out and enter the Protectorate in search of and returning from work. These figures show the extent to which the Nyasa is dependent on getting employment elsewherethan in his own country. His opportunities for employment in the Union arebeing restricted considerably. If this happened elsewhere for any reason it wouldbe disastrous for him.It is a matter for concern that none of those who oppose Federation have everattempted to explain this to their people or to explain what would follow secessionand the consequent restriction of financial resources. There would be less and less money to be spent by the Government. Inevitably, this would mean fewerschools for African children and even now it is only some 50 to 60 per cent, of african children who get an opportunity to learn to read and write and do sums.There would be fewer beds in hospitals, fewer dispensaries and less drugs. Theroads would deteriorate. There would be fewer advisory services to help the progressive farmer with his crops or with his stock. No opponent of theFederation appears to have told the Africans in the villages that this is the price that they would have to pay if they prefer what they describe as &quot; freedom &quot; tothe alternative status of regional autonomy within the Federation. The truth isthat the road away from an association between the territories leads to ignoranceand want for the peoples of Nyasaland. To suggest otherwise is to mislead thepeople and those who do so would have a heavy price to pay should they get their way and be required to fulfil the promises they have made for a bright future &apos;outside Federation.The allegation that the Europeans have totally rejected partnership does notaccord with the facts. It would be truer to say that in every case where practicesof segregation and discrimination existed before Federation, some progress hasbeen made in removing them. Thus persons of all races are now accepted in anumber of hotels and restaurants throughout the territory, whereas this was. not
the case before Federation. Greater advances have been made than beforeFederation in affording opportunities for advancement to Africans in commerce and the Public Service. The Federal Public Service, like the Nyasaland PublicService, is open to all races with promotion on the basis of merit. A multi-racialuniversity has been established in Salisbury since Federation. Laws criticised asperpetrating and perpetuating racial discrimination are often protective of african interests, but are gradually being amended where desirable to apply to changingconditions, as, for example, the Credit Trade with Africans Ordinance whichhas already been repealed. A racially shared form of local government has beeninaugurated. The African now has a greater degree of representation in theFederal Parliament and a greater say in his choice of representatives. Thetraining, placement and advancement of Africans in industry has made considerable progress since Federation. The Railway Regulations no longer discriminate onthe basis of colour or race. The colour bar in Post Offices has been removed.There are many more examples which could be quoted of the progress which hasbeen made in this context.&quot;Self-government NowNyasaland is now ready for self-government, and we would call uponyou as the Premier of Great Britain to declare that Nyasaland will now haveself-government outside Federation. Such a declaration would be fulfillingpromises made to the African people by Government Administrators earlyin 1891.&quot;Suggested Sense of ReplySelf-government is not a matter for simple declaration &quot;. It is a matter ofevolution. It is the objective of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, as the Prime minister  explained in the House of Commons on the 22nd July, 1959, to advance Nyasalandtowards fully responsible government. To say that Nyasaland is &quot; now ready for self-government&quot; is to ignore the facts. Thus, to take only one example, there isnot available to Nyasaland even the nucleus of a trained and qualified local staffsufficient and competent to man and run the government machine. Without thestaff to run the machine self-government or indeed any form of government isimpossible.&quot; The Interim ConstitutionThis Constitution should be abandoned, and a new Constitution broughtabout before the 1960 conference. The new Constitution should give overallAfrican majority in both Executive Council and Legislative Council.We shall be interested in nothing short of Representative Governmentbased on complete democratic principles established without further delay.&quot;Suggested Sense of ReplyIt is accepted that the present Constitution is no more than an interim one.The Nyasaland Government is most anxious that circumstances should developwhich would facilitate peaceful and profitable discussion on the matter of thenext stage of territorial constitutional advancement. As soon as circumstances permit the peaceful discussion of plans to this end will proceed, and the presentinterim Constitution will be reviewed.If the desire for a new Constitution before the 1960 Federal ConstitutionalReview is prompted by the wish to ensure the presence of a fully representativeNyasaland delegation at the conference, it is to be borne in mind that this canalready be effected within the terms of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution which provides for territorial delegations to be &quot; chosen by their respective Governments &quot;,i.e., the field of choice open to the Nyasaland Government is in no. way restricted.&quot; Lifting of State of Emergency, Reinstatement of Deposed Chiefs and Releaseof Detainees(i) We feel that as the country is back to normal the State of emergency should be lifted, and public meeting be allowed to be held.
(ii) Chiefs deposed owing to their opposition to Federation in 1953should be reinstated, and rustification orders placed on Mission Bvumbwe,Headman Ngamwane and others be removed.(iii) Release of all detainees.&quot;Suggested Sense of reply the State of Emergency can only be ended when the Governor is satisfiedthat it is no longer necessary for the preservation of public order. It is, of course,his earnest hope, shared by us all, that the time when the Emergency can be broughtto an end will be speedily reached.The Chiefs to which the memorandum refers were not deposed but resigned.The question of their reinstatement, should they so desire it, must turn on theGovernor being satisfied that it would be in the interests of good administration in their areas to reinstate them.So far as the rustification order on Mission Bvumbwe and Headman Ngamwaneare concerned, these orders which are the subject of review at six-monthly intervals,were issued on the recommendations of a Court of Law. The question of theirrevocation can only arise when it is clear that the interests of public security nolonger enjoin the restriction of those concerned.As to the release of &quot; all detainees &quot;, the release of each individual depends on whether and when the Governor is satisfied that he is no longer a danger tothe maintenance of public order.&quot; Lastly the Congress Liberation Party declare that in order to restorepeace and loyalty to the British Crown, the following demands of the peopleof Nyasaland should be granted without delay:(i) Nyasaland to Secede from Federation of Central Africa, and declareNyasaland an African State without delay.(ii) British Government to declare that Nyasaland will have self-government now.(iii) That the Interim Constitution be abandoned, and a new Constitutionbe introduced with an overall majority in both Executive and legislative Councils before the review of the Federal Constitutionthis year.(iv) I. That the State of Emergency be lifted.II. Deposed Chiefs be reinstated.III. Rustification Orders be removed on people affected.IV. Release of all detainees.&quot;These points have already been dealt with in the earlier part of this note.
Record of a Meeting with a Delegation from the Central Africa Party (NyasalandDivision) held at Government House, Zomba, on 25th January, 1960, atThe leader of the delegation, Mr. Kumbikano, opened the meeting by sayingthat they were very pleased indeed that in the short time available to himMr. Macmillan was able to see them and hear their views. He then asked mr. Tracy, the Nyasaland Division Secretary, to explain the party&apos;s policy to Mr. Macmillan.Mr. Tracy described the events which had taken place in Nyasaland since the unrest in March 1959. After measures had been taken to deal with that unrest the nyasaland Government seemed to be in a strong position, but since then it had lost the initiative. The African National Congress had been allowed to re-formunder a new name. Moderate Africans throughout the territory were beingintimidated and the Central Africa Party, which was late in the field in Nyasaland,found itself hamstrung.The dominant factor in Nyasaland politics to-day was fear of SouthernRhodesia. The problem was essentially one of human relations. Since theFederation was formed in 1953 a considerable number of Europeans from SouthernRhodesia had come into Nyasaland bringing with them Southern Rhodesianattitudes and modes of behaviour towards Africans. In racial questions theSouthern Rhodesians were closely akin to the South Africans. This provoked manyAfricans into extremist views and indeed the Malawi Congress Party, which hadreplaced the African National Congress after the latter was banned, were blackracialists. If they achieved power they would no doubt turn Nyasaland into a one-party State.The Central Africa Party&apos;s view was that Dr. Banda was the only effectiveleader of the people of Nyasaland. To them he was the Messiah. The central africa Party believed that Dr. Banda should be released but that his lieutenantsshould continue to be detained. If they were released it would certainly become necessary to declare another state of emergency.The Central Africa Party would be prepared to meet Dr. Banda in negotiations and would try to persuade him that a franchise similar to the Tanganyika franchiseshould be adopted in Nyasaland. At the same time they thought it would benecessary to safeguard the rights of minorities by giving the Governor a veto onlegislation and the right to dissolve the Legislative Council. The United FederalParty had put forward a proposal that the Legislature might be divorced from theExecutive on the lines of the American system, but the Central Africa Partyconsidered that, although this might be acceptable in principle, it would prove impossible to secure its adoption in practice.Mr. Tracy then spoke about the Monckton Commission and said that in theview of the Central Africa Party, Mr. Wellington Chirwa would be a worthlessmember. He was hoping to be appointed to the Monckton Commission solely inorder to secure financial advantage for himself.Mr. Tracy went on to say that, if the Federation was to continue in existence(as the Central Africa Party desired), it would be necessary for the Federal structureto be loosened. The Central Africa Party considered that all ties should be removedexcept those of customs, finance, foreign affairs, communications and the monetary system. They considered that on this basis Nyasaland should continue under atemporary constitution to be a member of the Federation for five years and thata plebiscite should then be held under which the people of Nyasaland could decide whether or not to remain permanently in the Federation.4.15 p.m.Present:United kingdom mr, Harold macmillan mr. J. H. RobertsonMr. C. R. KumbikanoMr. W. G. TracyMr. A. MarshallMr. C. G. WhiteheadMr. B. PhiriMr. A. NyirendaNyasaland
Mr. Nyirenda said that the Nyasaland Government had been unable toremove the uncertainty which was hanging over all the inhabitants of the territory.It was essential that they should put forward a firm policy so that everybody should know where they stood, Mr. Marshall said that he had lived for thirty years in nyasaland. It had been a happy place. Relations between Europeans and Africanshad been very cordial. He would do anything he could to restore that state ofaffairs. To-day, however, moderate Africans were being intimidated. he considered that the only way to prevent further deterioration in the situation wasto give the people of Nyasaland the right to secede from, the Federation if they wished to do so.At this point Mr. Macmillan said that he had the impression that the feelingwhich existed in Nyasaland against the Federation was not against the concept of federation as such. It was rather, he thought, an expression of the feeling that theFederation concealed an attempt to spread racial domination. The Federationundoubtedly brought material benefits to the people of Nyasaland and theimportant thing was that psychological fear of it should be removed.Mr. Tracy agreed with this. He said that the Christian missions had played a great part in the history of Nyasaland and that until recently it had been recognisedthat the purpose of the Government had been to bring the people of Nyasalandforward to the point where they could rule themselves. In this way a feeling oftrust had grown up between the people of Nyasaland and the United KingdomGovernment. The imposition of Federation in 1953 had, however, broken this trust.Mr. Phiri agreed with this. He said that the interventions in the affairs of nyasaland by the Federal Government which had taken place since 1953 had hadthe result of stimulating African racialism. Now the Malawi Congress Party werepractising intimidation in the cause of this African racialism and the NyasalandGovernment did nothing to prevent it.Mr. Macmillan concluded the meeting by saying that he hoped that the central africa Party in Nyasaland would put their views to the Monckton Commission.On the question of federation he said that at one time it seemed almost inconceivablethat it would prove possible to build a successful federation in Nigeria.Nonetheless, success had been achieved there. Though circumstances in central africa were in some ways different from those in West Africa, there was nooverriding reason why in the fullness of time success should not also be achieved in Central Africa.Record of a Meeting held at Government House, Zomba, on Monday,25th January, 1960, at 5 15 p.m.Present:United Kingdom NyasalandMr. Harold Macmillan Sir Robert Armitage, GovernorSir Norman Brook Mr. C. W. F. Footman, Chief secretary mr. D. W. S. Hunt Mr. R. M. M. King, Attorney-GeneralMr. J. H. Ingham, Secretary for LocalGovernment and Social ServicesMr. Finney, Special BranchSir Robert Armitage, at Mr. Macmillan&apos;s request, gave a survey of the security situation in Nyasaland.The General Election in the United Kingdom had marked a stage in nyasaland; for, as soon as it was realised that there was not going to be a labour government, the detainees had decided that they would have to behave themselvesif they wanted to be let out and things had become much quieter throughout thecountry. This favourable trend had been reversed with the appearance of theMalawi Congress Party which, organised by Orton Chirwa, had spread rapidly inall the areas where the proscribed Congress Party had been strong: it now had
about 100 branches, as compared with the 200 Congress branches in March 1959.It was organised on the cell system, and Orton Chirwa tried to retain direct controlfrom his headquarters without any intervening local or provincial- organisation.His declared policy was to keep everything quiet until the bulk of the detaineeshad been released: indeed, he admitted that his aim was to create conditions&apos; soquiet that the Government would be obliged to release the detainees. Whether ornot Dr. Banda had authorised Orton Chirwa to use his name there was no doubtthat Dr. Banda was the real leader. In intimidating persons loyal to Governmentthe threat used by the Malawi Party was that Dr. Banda must come into power in nyasaland. This intimidation had caused much unease among Europeans andothers, including Africans. Unfortunately, it was not open to the Government totake a definite line to allay this unease because they were obliged to wait for theresult of the Monckton Commission and of the Constitutional Review. For somemonths to come there would be a political vacuum.Turning to Dr. Banda&apos;s personality, Sir Robert Armitage said that one of themost embarrassing conclusions of the Devlin Report was that which drew a distinction between him and his colleagues. Public opinion now looked onDr. Banda as a mild little man from North Willesden. Pressure for his releasewas therefore widespread. Nobody cared about his lieutenants who could remainlocked up without disturbing opinion in Nyasaland at all. The Nyasas were notnaturally a riotous people, and were used to a paternal form of government; andhe did not think they would mind how many detainees were still in prison solong as Dr. Banda was released. Dr. Banda was now a symbol or a myth. Onthe other hand if, at the same time as Dr. Banda was released, his lieutenants were also released, then there might well be serious trouble.Mr. Footman said that the Malawi Party had closer links with the trades union than the Congress Party had had. This was an added danger. Dr. Bandahad never shown himself able to control his own extreme followers.Mr. Ingham said that in the Africans&apos; mind the principal motive was hatredof Federation. They were demanding African self-government less for its ownsake than because they thought that, if they were self-governing, they would bebetter able to fight Federation. It could therefore be argued that it was logicalto settle first the nature of Nyasaland&apos;s association with the Rhodesias because,if that could be made reasonably acceptable, the Nyasas would be likely to agreeto go forward to self-government at a pace more suited to their limited capabilities.The trouble was that if Dr. Banda was released he would think that we were in ahurry, that things were going as he had forecast, and that he was therefore in astrong position.Sir Robert Armitage said that he had originally agreed with the colonial secretary a programme for the release of detainees, and of Dr. Banda, much moredeliberate than that with which he was now faced as a result of the cabinets decision of 4th January.Mr. Macmillan said that two points seemed to be agreed:(i) that we could not detain Dr. Banda indefinitely;(ii) that he was more of a demagogue than an active organiser so that, if he were let out and his more dangerous lieutenants continued to be detained, we might have the best of both worlds.Mr. Footman said that the purpose of releasing Dr. Banda was to holdconstitutional discussions with him. He might well, however, refuse to talk aboutthe constitution of Nyasaland while it still remained within the framework of federation. Sir Robert Armitage thought it might be an incentive for Dr. Bandato promise to put him on the Nyasaland delegation for the Constitutional Review.It would certainly be valuable to have him on the delegation. The result mightbe that he would agree to constitutional talks. He himself thought it much thebest for those talks to take place in London. Perhaps Dr. Banda would voluntarilyagree to go there; alternatively he could be let out on the condition that he should go at once to London, and be put back in prison if he failed to do so. The analogy of Archbishop Makarios suggested itself. Perhaps Dr. Banda could be told thathe was free to go anywhere other than the Federation (he had already been declareda prohibited immigrant in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia). The reason why he must be kept out of Nyasaland was that his Party was pledged to a policyof secession and, whatever his own inclinations might be, if he were free in
Nyasaland he would be forced by pressure of his colleagues and followers toagitate for secession. This agitation would go on until November at least withoutany possibility of an answer being given. It could produce a security situationworse than that of 1959.Mr. Macmillan said that it seemed to be agreed, not only that Dr. Banda mustbe let out, but also that we must have serious constitutional talks with him, because it was not worth while talking to anyone else. Although Dr. Banda was at presentrefusing to talk within the framework of the Federal Constitution he might, whenreleased, have the sense to realise that no change could be made until, at any rate,the Review Conference; and that, meanwhile, some constitutional advance in nyasaland would at least make things better rather than worse. He could carryon with the argument about Federation later.Mr. Ingham said that a lot depended on how far we were prepared or ableto go in giving Nyasaland an African Government. Sir Robert Armitage pointedbut that any change in the territorial constitution had to be agreed with the federal government. A rapid advance in Nyasaland would have effects on northern rhodesia. Perhaps a rapid advance was out of the question, since the most thatthe Federal and Southern Rhodesian Governments would consider acceptable asa basis for self-government for Nyasaland would be very much less favourable toAfricans than Dr. Banda&apos;s minimum.Mr. Footman said that the Monckton Commission was supposed to be in nyasaland from 16th March to 9th April. If Dr. Banda were released southern rhodesian Europeans might give evidence to the Commission strongly attackingFederation and wanting to be rid of Nyasaland.Mr. Macmillan said that he did not see how Dr. Banda could be let out ofprison but obliged to remain in London for months negotiating without being allowed to return to Nyasaland. Mr. Finney said that in a speech in Zomba inJanuary 1959, Dr. Banda had recognised that negotiations would take a long time.Sir Robert Armitage said that it was only necessary to keep him in play until Juneor July, because from then onv/ards interest would be focused on the Review.We had to try to fill in six months, and he hoped that talks in London would help to this end. Mr. Ingham said that Dr. Banda might be nervous about his reception in Nyasaland and might welcome the idea of talks with the Colonial secretary in London.Mr. Macmillan said that if there was any question of Dr. Banda being refusedpermission to return to Nyasaland there would be severe public criticism, inParliament and in the Press, in the United Kingdom. Was this not likely to endanger security in Nyasaland? The cry at present was for Dr. Banda&apos;s release;if he were released but exiled the cry would be for his return to his own country.It was agreed to resume this discussion later on the same evening.Record of a Meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr. Dingle Foot, M.P., heldin Government House, Zomba, on Monday, 25th January, 1960, at 10 - 20 p.ra.Mr. Dingle Foot said that he was speaking as the legal adviser of Dr. Banda,with whom he had been having consultations. Dr. Banda had asked him to handover a memorandum to the Prime Minister. A copy of this memorandum is annexed to this record. Mr. Foot was understood to say that a copy of thismemorandum was being sent to Lord Home and to Lord Monckton.In discussion Mr. Foot made the following points:(a) Dr. Banda was strongly opposed to Federation and would never, under any circumstances, change his attitude on this.(b) If he were released from detention at this stage he would be preparedto give evidence before the Monckton Commission and would advise his followers to do the same. His influence in Nyasaland was verygreat, and his advice on this point would be accepted.SECRET5664.7 Q
(c) He would nut agree to be released from detention unless his friends were also released or an early definite date were fixed for their release.id) Dr. Banda was extremely interested in constitutional reform as a subjectof study and he would be very pleased to join in discussions on thefuture constitution of Nyasaland.(e) Dr. Banda could be trusted to keep his word.(/) Dr. Banda was opposed to violence.(g) Dr. Banda would be very susceptible to a personal approach at high level.(h) Dr. Banda would want to be released in Nyasaland and not be requiredto go anywhere else.Mr. Macmillan asked Mr. Foot whether Dr. Banda would be prepared to takea responsible view and be ready to co-operate in good faith and with sincerity inthe search for an acceptable solution of the problems confonting them. Mr. Footseemed to suggest that Dr. Banda would only be ready to do this if his points were met.The meeting terminated at 10 - 50 p.m.annex memorandum HANDED TO Mr.  MACMILLAN  BY  Mr.  DINGLEFOOT, M.P., 25th JANUARY,  1960Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has carefully considered the suggestion made to himby the Chief Secretary of the Nyasaland Government on January 4, 1960, thathe should give evidence before the Monckton Commission. He feels that hecould not usefully give such evidence while still in detention. He would be speaking,and would be generally regarded as speaking, not merely for himself but for his followers in Nyasaland with whom he has had no opportunity for consultationsince March 3, 1959. He feels that consultation would be essential for thepreparation of his evidence.2. As stated in his letter to Mr. Footman of January 5, 1960, Dr. Bandaalso feels that it would be impossible for him to give evidence before theCommission while over 400 of his followers were still in detention and the stateof emergency still continued. He is further of the opinion that the commission could not conduct a full inquiry while emergency powers were still in operation.Even if witnesses were fully protected against criminal or civil proceedings inrespect of their evidence they could hardly speak freely if they knew that at any moment they might be arbitrarily detained without charge or trial.3. Nevertheless Dr. Banda would be prepared to give evidence before theCommission, and to advise all his followers to do the same, if the following conditions were assured:(a) The state of emergency would be declared at an end and the detaineesreleased.(b) An assurance would be given that ex-detainees would not be furtherdetained or restricted under the statutory powers now possessed by the nyasaland Government, or any similar powers which might be enacted,on the grounds which led to their detention under emergency powers,or on account of their evidence before the Commission.(c) A similar assurance would be given that witnesses before the Commissionwho had not been detained under emergency powers, would not be detained or restricted under such statutory powers as aforesaid onaccount of their evidence.(d) All evidence before the Commission would be the subject of absoluteprivilege in respect of both civil and criminal proceedings.
(e) All witnesses who desired to give evidence whether orally or in writingbefore the Commission would (so far as practicable) be afforded ani opportunity to do so.(/) It would be at the option of each witness to decide whether his or herevidence would be given in public or private.(g) All witnesses giving evidence to the Commission would be free to expressany views they might wish regarding(i) the policies hitherto pursued in relation to Central Africa by her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, the federal government and the Governments of the three territories, and(ii) the future of the three territories or any of them. It would be opento them, if they so desired, to advocate secession by one ormore of the territories from the Federation, association by oneor more of the territories with other territories now outside theFederation, or forms of association between the three territoriesalternative to Federation.4. This memorandum has been shown to Mr. H. B. Chipembere andMr. D. K. Chisiza who are both in agreement with it.H. K. B.H. B. C.D. K. C.D F.Her Majesty&apos;s Prison, .Gwelo, Southern Rhodesia,24th January, 1960.Record of a Meeting held at Government House, Zomba, on Monday,25th January, 1960, at 11 p.m.Present:United Kingdom NyasalandMr. Harold Macmillan Sir Robert Armitage, GovernorSir Norman Brook Mr. C. W. F. Footman, Chief secretary mr. D. W. S. Hunt Mr. R. M. M. King, Attorney-GeneralMr. J. H. Ingham, Secretary for LocalGovernment and Social ServicesMr. Finney, Special BranchMr. Macmillan said that he had given much thought, since the earlier meeting was adjourned, to the question of the release of Dr. Banda. He had not yet come to a conclusion. He did not wish to intervene as principal, in a matter for which theColonial Secretary was the Minister primarily responsible. It had, however, beenvery helpful to him to have been in Zomba, to have heard the views of membersof the Executive Council and to have learned something of the local background.In further discussion the following points were made.(a) If Dr. Banda were released in Nyasaland the Africans would think this a victory for him. They would begin at once to look for the fulfilment of theextravagant promises he had made, such as the reduction of taxation and the repeal of certain legislation. Attacks on Europeans might start at once.Dr. Banda&apos;s control over his followers was not strong enough to enable him toensure that they behaved themselves.Mr. Macmillan observed that these were sound reasons for not releasingDr. Banda at all. Yet he thought that at their earlier meeting they had come tothe conclusion that it was impossible to continue indefinitely the state of emergency
and the detention of Dr. Banda. The Governor and his official advisers agreedthat it would not be possible to continue direct rule in the hope that a moderateParty would emerge: Dr. Banda was the only African leader with whom we coulddeal.(b) If Dr. Banda had to be at large in Nyasaland this should be postponed until after the Monckton Commission had left. There was danger that the arrival of the Monckton Commission might by itself cause disturbances and, if Dr. Bandawere at large in Nyasaland at the time, these disturbances could take a seriousturn. The dates of 15th or 25th February, to the latter of which the Governor hadearlier reluctantly assented, had been given to him by the Colonial Secretary asan instruction, and he was left nothing but the freedom to choose between them.He had then preferred the latter date as the lesser evil; but he had talked it overmuch since then with his advisers and now begged the Prime Minister to allow himmore time before he had to release Dr. Banda. He would like the colonial secretary to come and discuss the question on the spot before a decision was taken.(c) The ideal solution, in the view of the Governor and his advisers, was that dr. Banda should agree, when released, to go at once to the United Kingdom for constitutional discussions there. If he would not go voluntarily they would beprepared to see some legal force brought to bear on him to compel him to go.He should be forbidden to return to Nyasaland (he was already a prohibitedimmigrant in the other two Territories of the Federation) but might be at liberty to go anywhere else.Mr. Macmillan said that he was convinced that it was illusory to think alongthose lines. To release Dr. Banda and then exile him would be indefensible toParliament and public opinion. Rather than contemplate such a solution he would prefer to keep Dr. Banda under restraint for another year.(d) Sir Robert Armitage and his advisers thought that it was not impossible that Dr. Banda would agree voluntarily to go to the United Kingdom for talks.Some of his associates had reported that he was nervous about what might happen if he came out of detention in Nyasaland. He rather fancied himself as a constitutional expert. It would however be a tactical error on his part, which hewas not likely to make, to agree to discussions without conditions. The difficultythen was that he would probably refuse to talk about a constitution for Nyasalandwhich presupposed that Nyasaland remained in the Federation; after all, the basisof his policy, and the ground for his popularity with his followers, was his advocacyof secession. From our side, too, it was difficult to think of a proper basis for talks on the territorial constitution until we knew what sort of shape the Federationwould take as a result of the Monckton Commission and the Review Conference.Mr. Macmillan suggested that it might be possible to engage in talks withdraw. Banda on the understanding that their result would be without prejudice to thefuture relationship between Nyasaland and the other two Territories. On this basisit would be good tactics on our&apos;part to make a really generous offer. There wouldhave to be two elements in this: a genuine political advance for Nyasaland andan undertaking that Dr. Banda should be nominated to the Nyasaland delegation to the Constitutional Review. It he turned down something which looked like a fairdeal, he would lose a lot of his support in the United Kingdom (and this was a valuable source of strength to him in Nyasaland) and would also reduce his influence in Nyasaland.(e) Sir Robert Armitage and his advisers expressed the opinion that Dr. Bandawould not insist on his companions also being released before he would take partin discussions. They maintained that there was no evidence to support such an assumption, and some evidence that he was already turning against his closestassociates among the detainees.Mr. Macmillan, summing up the discussion, said that the view of the governor and his advisers appeared to be, first, that Dr. Banda must be released and,secondly, that he must not be left at large in Nyasaland. There were two proposalsfor achieving the latter purpose either to take some legal steps, the precise natureof which was not yet clear, to require him to go to the United Kingdom; or to invite him to London for talks and to hope that the result of these talks would be such as to allow him thereafter to return to Nyasaland without creating an impossible security situation. He proposed to give further thought to the problem,and he would discuss it in Salisbury with Sir Roy Welensky on 26th January.
Record of a Meeting with a Delegation from the United Federal Party (NyasalandDivision) held at the House of the Acting Provincial Commissioner, Blantyre,on Tuesday, 26th January, 1960, at 11.15 a.m.Mr. Little opened the meeting by saying that the United Federal Partyrepresented all the races in the Federation. For a long time the party had takenvery little interest in territorial matters and it was only within the last year or twothat it had attempted to recruit African members in Nyasaland. The Partyconsidered that the overriding need in Nyasaland at present was for stability. Itwas important that moderates, especially moderate Africans, should have theopportunity to make themselves heard. Without stability they would not have this opportunity. Mr. Little asked Mr. Matinga to elaborate on this point.Mr. Matinga said that the United Federal Party had been greatly perturbed bythe situation which had developed in Nyasaland since Dr. Banda returned to thecountry. The Nyasas were traditionally a peaceful people and the state of race relations in the territory had always been happy. The Africans recognised thatthe European, Asian and coloured communities had all helped them. This happystate of race relations had been destroyed as a result of the events which took place after Dr. Banda&apos;s return to Nyasaland. Intimidation now seemed to beuncontrolled. If fear was to be removed, the Government must act firmly. It wasdisturbing to hear rumours that Dr. Banda and the other detainees were to be released. Dr. Banda was not wanted in Nyasaland, and if he and his associateswere released a situation more serious than that prevailing in March 1959 would develop. The majority of Nyasaland Africans were grateful to the Europeans for having made Nyasaland what it was to-day.Mr. Phiri endorsed what Mr. Matinga had said. Stability was needed if furtherinvestment in the country was to be forthcoming. After all, Nyasaland&apos;s advance to its present state had been due to investment from overseas. If stability and confidence were to be achieved a multi-racial Government would be needed.Mr. Phiri knew Dr. Banda quite well. Indeed, he had been Acting President of the nyasaland African National Congress when Dr. Banda arrived in Nyasaland in1958. He had received Dr. Banda and had advised him that all races should work together. Unfortunately Dr. Banda had not accepted this advice. Mr. Phiri had recently visited the Central Province and had talked with a number of chiefs and sub-chiefs. Without exception they did not want Dr. Banda to be released: they wanted stability and an end of intimidation. Many people in Nyasaland hadbeen disturbed by recent statements by the Colonial Secretary which appeared toindicate that the end of the emergency would shortly be declared and the detaineeswould be released.Mr. Roop Singh said that Asian feeling was in accord with the views expressedby Mr. Matinga and Mr. Phiri. The Asian community wanted full partnership.They also wanted stability.Mr. Surtee spoke for the coloured community and said that he was verypleased the Prime Minister had been able to meet the delegation. The colouredcommunity also wanted peace and stability. They were alarmed at reports of theColonial Secretary&apos;s recent interview with Mr. Orton Chirwa and they werefrightened by rumours that Dr. Banda would shortly be released.Mr. Warren said that his family had lived in Nyasaland since 1919 and thathe could therefore claim some knowledge of the country and the people. One ofthe things which undermined confidence was that the public speeches andpronouncements made about the future of the Federation and of Nyasaland wereoften  confused  and  difficult  to  understand.    Uneducated  Africans  easilyPresent:United kingdom mr. Harold macmillan mr. J. H. RobertsonNyasalandMr.Mr.Mr.Mr.Mr.Mr.L. A. LittleC. J. MatingaR. WarrenB. W. Matthews PhiriSurteeRoop Singh
misunderstood what was being said. The standard of education in Nyasaland wasvery low. Fifty per cent, of the population went to Government-assisted missionschools for three years, and the remainder went to Government schools for fiveyears: only 10 per cent, of primary school pupils went on to secondary education.The forecast was that by 1970 only 12 Nyasaland Africans would be graduatingfrom university each year. This number was hopelessly insufficient. A massiveimprovement in educational facilities was necessary. This could only be achieved if the United Kingdom Government gave heavy subsidies to the NyasalandGovernment or if responsibility for African education were transferred to theFederal Government.Mr. Warren went on to speak about land tenure. Four years agoMr. Lennox-Boyd, when Colonial Secretary, had given an assurance that thequestion of land tenure in Nyasaland was being examined. Nothing had happenedsince then. The present form of communal land ownership was a positivedisincentive to efficient and productive farming. If Africans could only be giventhe right to own freehold land it would be possible to transform the presentsubsistence agriculture into profitable farming.Mr. Little concluded the delegation^ statement of its views by saying that theUnited Federal Party considered that a ten-year plan should be put forward for constitutional advance in Nyasaland. This would set out the steps required tobring the territory to self-government within the Federation. Once the plan hadbeen published it should not be altered without consent of all the races of theterritory.In reply, Mr. Macmillan said that he had listened to many different points of view about the future of the Federation and of Nyasaland. Politics was alwaysa confusing business. It was necessary to try to reconcile the various different views that were held and to reach a sensible solution. He could see that there might be merits in the proposal for a definite plan for constitutional advance. Thiswould give people something to work for, whereas at present many people seemedto have only something to work against. Nyasaland certainly needed financial help, and the United Kingdom Government would continue to do what they could to provide assistance. Changes in the system of land tenure were no doubt required;but this was a delicate matter, for there was always a danger that any change inthe system would be represented as an attempt by Europeans to seize African landfor their own use. It would be much easier to introduce changes in the system ofland tenure under a properly elected, fully responsible, Government.Mr. Macmillan concluded by saying that his impression was that theopposition to federation was largely psychological. It arose primarily from the fear that federation was a cloak for European domination. If it were possible tobring about constitutional advance in Nyasaland he hoped that Africans therewould be able to recognise more clearly the force of the economic arguments infavour of federation.Record of a Meeting with a Delegation from the Nyasaland Asian Conventionheld at the House of the Acting Provincial Commissioner, Blantyre, on tuesday, 26th January, 1960, at 11.45 a.m.Mr. Sacranie opened the meeting by saying that he and his colleagues weregrateful to Mr. Macmillan for giving them the opportunity to talk to him.Present:United kingdom mr. Harold macmillan mr. J. H. RobertsonMr. A. Sattar SacranieDr. S. S. KokriMr. K. J. AminMr. P. T. PatelMr. James F. D&apos;MelloMr. Daud J. KarimNyasaland
Mr. Sacranie said that African opposition to federation was a fact which mustbe recognised. It had grown continually since the Federation was established in1953. He was convinced that the United Kingdom Government were sincere intheir attempt to bring about partnership in Central Africa. None the less the fact was that the races were drifting apart. The gulf between the different communitieshad now become almost unbridgeable. If the necessary transformation of attitudeswas to take place it must be recognised that the Africans were strongly opposedto federation and that they wished at least to have the right to secede from it.Their opposition was not to the concept of federation as such. It was ratheropposition to a form of government which they feared would involve eventualdomination by the Europeans in Southern Rhodesia.With regard to the Monckton Commission, Mr. Sacranie regretted that its terms of reference appeared to prevent it from considering the possibility ofwinding-up the Federation. It seemed doubtful whether the Commission wouldbe free to make such recommendations as would fully meet the requirements ofthe situation. He thought that the United Kingdom Government should reconsiderthis point.So far as concerned the political situation in Nyasaland itself Mr. Sacraniesaid that he had at one time been an advocate of racial representation in theLegislative Council. Now, however, he had to recognise that with the flight oftime African political consciousness had grown to an extent which made racialparity unacceptable. Fully responsible Government ought to be introduced as soonas possible, and the minority communities would have to accept the fact that itwas for them to reach a modus vivendi with the Africans. He considered thatresponsible Government should be introduced in Nyasaland before the review ofthe Federal Constitution took place so that the Nyasaland representatives at the review would have the full support of public opinion in the territory. Furthermore,the state of emergency should be brought to an end as quickly as possible. Thiswould involve the release of Dr. Banda and other detainees. The Asians had, it istrue, been worried about many of the things Dr. Banda had said but they recognisedthat their only policy was to try to come to terms with him. After all, the Asiansin Nyasaland were dependent on the good will of the Africans and Dr. Banda wasthe acknowledged leader of African opinion. By bringing the emergency to an end and releasing the detainees the United Kingdom Government would remove thebitterness which existed at present among the people of Nyasaland and wouldenhance their own prestige and authority in the territory.No other member of the delegation wished to add to what Mr. Sacranie had said.Mr. Macmillan said that he was grateful for the clarity with which mr. Sacranie had put forward his views. He could not agree, however, with what mr. Sacranie had said about the Monckton Commission. The Commission had as chairman and members people who were recognised to be impartial and able. Thepurpose of the Commission was to prepare the ground for the decisions which thefive Governments would be called upon to take at the time of the review of theFederal Constitution. The Commission^ work would be a massive briefingoperation for the Governments concerned. Naturally it would be the responsibilityof the Governments to take the decisions when the time came. He hoped that as many people as possible would give their views to the Commission. As regardsthe composition of the Nyasaland Delegation to the Review Conference,Mr. Macmillan did not think this need consist solely of Ministers. It would be forthe Nyasaland Government at the time to choose the best representatives of thevarious sections of opinion in Nyasaland. When the time came they would, if they wished, be able to send Dr. Banda or anybody else.Mr. Macmillan said that he agreed with Mr. Sacranie&apos;s view about Africanopposition to federation. As he saw it, the Africans were not opposed toco-operation between the three territories for economic purposes. Even in Europerecently six great countries with different national traditions of their own had cometogether in the European Common Market. The African fear of federation sprangfrom fear of white domination by Southern Rhodesia. He was sure that, if thatfear could be removed, the attitude of Nyasaland Africans towards federation wouldchange.Mr. Sacranie said that he and his colleagues were glad to have met mr.. Macmillan and were happy to see how real an understanding of their problemshe had. He assured Mr. Macmillan that the Asian community in Nyasaland would always wish to co-operate with the United Kingdom Government.
MAIN POLICY SPEECHAddress by the Rt. Hon. Harold Macmillan, M.P., to the Rhodesia NationalAffairs Association; Salisbury, 19th January, 1960Three years ago when I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I made up my mind that I would try to visit, while in office, all the leading countries of theCommonwealth. It was a year before I was able to start upon my travels; and atthe beginning of 1958 I made a journey to three of the Commonwealth countriesin Asia India, Pakistan and Ceylon, and then on to Australia and New Zealand.Two years have intervened, in which I have also made visits to Canada, the UnitedStates and, of course, Russia. Two years and a General Election at home.Fortified by all these experiences, at home as well as overseas, I have now felt ableto make this further journey to four countries in Africa which have either attainedor are nearing, the status of full Commonwealth membership.Why have I made these journeys? To see for myself something- of theseCommonwealth countries and their peoples; to see and try to understand the developments that are taking place in them and the problems with which their people are faced; and to have personal talks with political leaders representing allshades of opinion in an informal and friendly atmosphere. Of course, the PrimeMinisters of the Commonwealth come to our periodical conferences in London.But I have felt that this should not remain a one-way traffic. I am not so foolishas to suppose that in these all too brief visits I can acquire a deep or detailedknowledge of these great countries and their diverse problems. I do not aim atbecoming an expert, I certainly don&apos;t propose to write a book, even if I could finda publisher. But I know very well from experience already gained that all I have heard and read about these countries is brought into sharper focus by seeingsomething of them at first hand and meeting some of the people in their own land.I know, too, that when I get back and deal once more with the questions which will come before me and my colleagues at home I can approach them with a keenerinsight and a clearer understanding because of the personal contacts made during these journeys. It is in this spirit and with this purpose that I have come to theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.I should like to make it quite clear at the very outset of my visit that I havenot come to engage in negotiations about your constitutional future. I shall, ofcourse, be exchanging views on this question in the conversations I shall be havingwith political leaders both European and African whom I shall meet in thecourse of my journeys. Naturally, all that I see and hear while I am in yourcountry will be of the greatest help as background to the decisions which will indue course have to be taken. I have been greatly heartened by the very kindwelcome which my wife and I have received since our arrival. Nor do I forget,nobody could forget, the loyalty and devotion of all your people to the crown and to the Commonwealth. Both in war and in many difficult emergencies whichhave arisen since the war, whenever we are in need we know that we can look to the support of your forces for the defence of our common interests.I am glad to be making this journey through Africa in 1960, which for manyAfrican countries will be a year of great decisions. In all parts of this continentthe tide of nationalism is flowing fast. Fifteen years ago, at the end of the war, we saw something very similar in Asia and many countries, of very different races andcivilisation, were then pressing their claim to independent national life. The BritishGovernment and Parliament of those days decided not to seek to stifle or restrainwhat they recognised as the legitimate national aspirations of peoples for whosedestinies Britain had hitherto been responsible. As a result, India, Pakistan,Ceylon, Malaya, all stand with us to-day as free and equal partners in theCommonwealth. Now we are faced with a similar growth of national consciousnessin Africa. This is one of the facts of the African situation to-day. We must accept it as a fact. And take it into account in framing our policies.My journey has already led me to two countries in West Africa where we have followed the same policy as in Asia. It has been equally successful. Ghana onattaining independence has freely chosen to remain within the Commonwealth
and to continue her association with Great Britain, which has already broughtsuch benefits to both countries. Nigeria, which I left yesterday, will become independent in October and has already made clear her keen desire to remain within the Commonwealth. I was deeply impressed during my short visit to thesetwo countries by the warmth of their regard for the United Kingdom and thestrength of their desire to remain in close and friendly partnership with us andwith all countries of the Commonwealth. In Ghana and in Nigeria the last stages of advance to independence have been both rapid and uninterrupted. For in countries with homogeneous populations the rate of advance can be geared tothe speed at which representative institutions and administrative efficiency can be developed. Responsibility can be transferred as soon as the institutions ofgovernment have been established and local people are ready and able to workthem. Both in Ghana and in Nigeria I was struck by the smoothness of thistransition. Naturally there are strains and stresses especially in the early years.But I am confident, from what I have seen, that they will be able to manage theirown affairs and prove loyal members of our Commonwealth team.Of course this rapid evolution is partly due to the fact that these two west african countries have had a special place in the history of the continent. Forcenturies past their people have been exposed to the current of world affairs. trade has flourished there for hundreds of years. The European came there by sea:and of course at the same time across the desert came the caravans from Timbuctooand Morocco in those distant days important centres of culture and commerce.Locally, too, there were the rudiments of industry and culture. Mines were workedthere. And-their people acquired skills in various crafts, produced considerableworks of art, and developed a lively internal commercial system. All this proved a firm foundation for the educational opportunities which they have had under british rule. Over the last 100 years numbers of them have been trained in law,in science and in medicine. They have entered into modern commerce and theirartisans have added to their traditional craft the refinements of Europeantechniques. As a result there is to-day a large educated population to be numberedin thousands. Indeed many families on the West Coast have for generations hada tradition of sending their children to Britain to be educated. We must rememberall this when we are thinking of West Africa past and future.From West Africa to the Federation, from Accra to Salisbury, nearly 3,000miles-almost as far as from London to Accra and that within a part, only a part,of a single continent. Yet some people I fear at home talk as if Africa were asingle and homogeneous unity &quot; Oh, you&apos;re going to Africa: you are sure to see my-son and daughter-in-law they live there &quot;. Such simple talk is as wide of the mark as the ideas of those who suppose that Africa&apos;s widely divergent problemscan be met by a single and uniform solution. It was only yesterday that I arrived in Salisbury. Already I have formed an impression of your vigorous mountingprogress. Scarcely seventy years have passed since the Pioneer Column arrived on this spot. Rhodesians have a right to be proud of all that they have achievedsince then. Out of a sparsely peopled, undeveloped land, your pioneers built up a vigorous and go-ahead country. Their successors have proved worthy of thosewho led the way and the great city of Salisbury growing every minute standsto-day as a monument of their achievement.Alas, I shall have time to visit only a few of the other thriving cities and townsin the Federation. Nor shall I be able to see much of the farms and mines onwhich so much of your prosperity depends. But I can assure you that we in Britainappreciate and admire this hard work, energy and faith by which these flourishingenterprises have been created. All through history ladies and gentlemen our people have gone out from the old country to the most distant parts of the worldwhen it was much more difficult than now. They have gone as missionaries, astraders, as administrators and as settlers and even the most jaundiced critic cannotdeny that their work has been greatly to the advantage of every country to whichthey have gone. Nevertheless I know you will forgive me for reminding you howheavy is the responsibility which lies upon you all whether you were born hereor came here only yesterday. You are the representatives of a great tradition offair play and constructive work. I want to assure you that we at home, whateveryou may occasionally read or hear, do not listen to them. I speak for the great mass of British people who look to you with affection and pride and equally, we,like you, share to the full the responsibility for all the peoples among whom&apos;youlive and work.R

Later this week I shall be visiting Kariba. I look forward keenly to seeingthis great feat of engineering. I know that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the queen Mother is greatly delighted to be coming here for the official opening inMay of this tremendous work which will mean so much to you all.Much of the credit for Kariba must go to Lord Malvern. The people of thiscountry were indeed fortunate when, over 50 years ago, Dr. Godfrey Huggins setup in practice in Salisbury. His place in the history of your country is assured.The torch which he carried so successfully has been handed to a worthy successor.I am very glad to be here to-day with my friend and colleague Sir Roy Welensky.Kariba is a splendid example of interdependence and co-operation betweenthe countries of the Commonwealth. You needed more power for rapid development. We joined with your Government in guaranteeing the World BankLoan for Kariba (the largest single loan the Bank has ever made) and we also made 10 millions available from our own sterling contribution to the Bank. TheColonial Development Corporation and the Commonwealth Development FinanceCompany in the United Kingdom also made large loans and I cannot help beingglad to know that no less than 82 per cent, of the total cost of this scheme was spent in the Commonwealth and that 85 per cent, of the mechanical and electricalplant was supplied by the Old Country in the face of intense world competition.Of course, there are always pessimists you referred to them, Sir-towhom the future appears clouded and uncertain. And no doubt you have some of them. We certainly have. But to them I would say look atthe facts. There are to-day many people outside the Federation Governmentsof all countries, financiers of all countries and hard-headed business men who have confidence in the future of your country. The proof, if proof is needed, is in theinvestments to undertakings in the Federation which have been and are beingmade. I am happy to say that in this Britain has been in the forefront.More recently, United Kingdom firms have made substantial financialcontributions to your own Industrial Development Corporation, which will assistthe development of industry in the Federation stimulated as it will be by thethe abundant power now to come from Kariba. We in the United Kingdom are most anxious to see that other Commonwealth countries are developed industriallyto the maximum possible extent and I am glad to think that a large number of firms whose names are household words in the United Kingdom have already decided to invest in industrial development in the Federation. I am told that many others have new projects in mind. This is, I think, an example of the way in whichinvestment follows on the heels of the export trade.For a good many years now the total United Kingdom investment in theFederation has been running at the rate of some  25 millions a year. It follows that, to a great extent, your economic future is linked with our economic prosperity.We in the United Kingdom aren&apos;t doing too badly there are some rash people who said that &quot; We&apos;ve never had it so good &quot;. I wouldn&apos;t &apos;t go as far as that. But i will take three simple tests earning, spending, and saving. More people areearning more and spending more than ever in our history and at the same timesavings, this is the vital point, which enable us to finance overseas development, are running at a record figure. During the last war of course we mobilised our economic resources to fight the war to an extent unequalled in any other country.We put all we had into the fight for freedom. Naturally we have had to pay theprice. But our recovery has therefore been slow but on the whole steady. Therehave been ups and downs receding as v/ell as advancing waves-but, broadly, ithas been a flowing tide and this prosperity in the United Kingdom has its effect allover the Commonwealth not least in the Federation. We are now investingoverseas, mostly in the Commonwealth from our savings from genuine savings-at the rate of some  200 millions a year.Our economy and yours therefore are closely linked. They are complementary.We need many things that you produce your copper, tobacco, tea, and now I amtold you are sending us your beef. You need the products of our manufacturing industry. I see no reason why these ties should be weakened. On the contrary^the improvement of communications and transport should bring us even closerin this field as time goes by.If, therefore, we look upOn the future economically or in terms of economic progress, I say the prospects are good. We have solid ground for confidence. but our economic life must be set in a political framework.  Indeed, it cannot thrive
unless the political basis of society is sound. The great challenge to you here, inthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, is to establish on a sound basis a social and political structure which reflects the political realities of your country in days of change. I am confident that you will meet this challenge in the same spirit withwhich you have overcome other difficulties in the past.Nor will your success be confined to your own territories. For you can bean example to the world and a model, for many areas in Africa, if you can succeed in your endeavour to create a society in which men, regardless of race, are judgedon their merits as individual men and enabled to make their individual contributionto the common good. This was the goal you set before yourselves when federation was launched. This is still your goal. This is the means by which, in this great partof Africa, you can satisfy the growing aspirations of Africans for politicalself-expression as well as for economic development. The task which thisgeneration of Rhodesians have set themselves is to find a way in which the variouscommunities in these three territories can live peacefully together and make their contribution to the life and welfare of the whole.This is the vital challenge which faces you to-day. . It is a different challengefrom that which faced the founders of your country, but it demands the samequalities vision, selflessness and courage. I and your very many friends in britain-in the old country are confident that the Rhodesians of to-day will play their part in this century no less nobly than their forerunners played in the last.Within the Commonwealth we have seen how multi-racial communities can beforged into a single nation. In Malaya and in the West Indies, for example,different communities, each having a stake in the land, are beginning learning toco-operate for the common good. What is possible in Asia is, I feel sure, possiblein Africa. And if you can set such an example in the heart of Africa then theconsequences for good will be felt far beyond the boundaries of the Federation.In your economic life, as I have said, much has already been achieved. Africansare rapidly acquiring the technical competence which enables them to play their full part in the industrial expansion of the Federation. To-day they hold their ownin a wide and expanding range of industrial skills. Industry is increasinglypractising co-operation between the races and setting an example which otherswould do well to follow. New wealth is being created, and all can be seen to besharing in the process and in its advantages. And these are widely spread. the growing financial and economic strength of the Federation benefits all its members,not least the Africans.The development of educational and health services can be and is being rightthrough the Federation enormously increased. That is well; for, while politiciansconfer and frame constitutions, life goes on. But throughout our Commonwealthstory we have done much more than create communities which can stand on theirown economic feet. We have always proceeded on the basis that in the countries of their birth all men should have political rights and carry political responsibilities.And if we have given special importance to the spread of education it is because we have desired that throughout the dependent territories for which we have been responsible that men and women should learn to practise the arts of administration and government for themselves.Your University College in Salisbury is giving a first-class education to menand women of all races. I look forward to the day when the same spirit will inspireyour technical colleges and secondary schools. Meanwhile, here is a remarkablefact worth repeating to all the world. In Southern Rhodesia the proportion of african children attending primary schools is already higher than in any otherAfrican country.These are the foundations on which democracy can be built. It cannot bedone in a day especially where different races are concerned. It is often a slowgrowth, even with a homogeneous population. Our own democracy at home hasevolved over centuries of experience. Of course we in Britain think that parliamentary democracy is the best political system we think that especially when we have just won a General Election. When we lose, we sometimes have our doubts. But whether the people have been wisely led, by statesmen that&apos;sus or misled by demagogues that&apos;s the other side we know that this system is not an easy one to work. It cannot be worked successfully without a high degreeof tolerance and self-discipline and humour. These are political qualities whichcannot be developed over-night.  They call for patience and for time.  And this
is why we have always wanted to be sure, before finally transferring our responsibility, our United Kingdom responsibility, that the duties and obligations of democracy were not only understood by the heads but felt in the hearts of thepeople. Our aim and yours has always been to ensure that every man who is subject to the law should have a right to its protection; that the rights of all communities in a country which is the home of them all should be safeguarded;and that all should have their due share in the work of government..In the fullness of time we hope that the Federation with the full consent ofthe peoples of its three territories will add in the complete sense its strength and influence to our Commonwealth association. We hope that its people, European,African and Asian alike, will play their full part in forging the future of a greatnation, of which all will be citizens and in all take a common pride. But this cannotcome about unless confidence can be built up on all sides. I must therefore sayagain to-day in Salisbury what I and my colleagues have said in Parliament inLondon: that&quot; whatever the outcome of the Monckton Commission on the formof the Federation and whatever the outcome of the 1960 Conference, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom will not withdraw their protection from thepeople of Nyasaland or Northern Rhodesia until their people so desire. I fear that something which I said about this at a Press Conference in Lagos onJanuary 13 has been misunderstood or misrepresented. I should like to take theopportunity to repeat the words which I actually used and having some littleexperience I now go about at these conferences with a tape recording machine and I quote from the record as played back by the machine. I said this &quot;... theGovernment of the United Kingdom has made it clear abundantly clear thatwe will not remove the protection of the British Government to either of theNorthern Territories Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland until it is clear that the expressed wish of these people is to enter into a full and independentFederation ...&quot; As you will see, I was speaking of the independent Federationof the future. I was repeating in other words exactly what I said and whatSir Roy knows I said in Parliament on July the 22nd. I said this &quot;... theBritish Government will certainly not withdraw its protection from Nyasaland and Rhodesia in the short run, and in the long run our object is to advance these territories to fully responsible government. They will then be able to dispense with our protection and stand entirely on their own feet as components of theFederation. When all the units are in a position to agree, and are agreed thatBritish Government protection is no longer needed then, and only then -can thewhole Federation go forward to full independence and full membership . . . &quot;That is the negative side and it does not rest only on my statements or those of mycolleagues. It is inherent in the preamble to the Federal Constitution. But it isthe negative side which it pledges to protect we have to make them but I want to say something about the positive Side, for that is what we are engaged in and I want to say it in fairness to all concerned. First I should like to make it plain that the function of the Monckton Commission is not to destroy the Federation far from it. It is to advise us how the Federation can best go forward. So that wehave that advice when we come to the governmental meetings and this is clear from its terms of reference, to which Sir Roy Welensky has referred. And I should like to make it plain that my Government stands by those terms of reference andlooks to the Commission to do a valuable and a constructive job. I am confident that it will. May I quote the words I have used in Parliament, especially inconnexion with the Monckton Commission, on July the 22nd immediately afterthe passage I have quoted, I said this &quot;... If we were to announce our intentionnow to disband the Federation, or form a new one, or to divide it into differentunits without waiting either for the Commission or for the 1960 Review; if wewere to tear up, without further thought, an experiment which is only seven years old and which was started with a good deal of good will on all sides, an experimentwhich has made very considerable progress, we should be guilty of an act oftreachery towards the high ideals and purposes which we set ourselves &quot;.&quot; I standby these words all of them and I do not wish to add to them, except perhaps tosay this. In much of the present controversy the origins of the Federation seemto have been forgotten or misrepresented. It was not a plan to enable oneterritory to obtain some advantage for itself. It was a plan to enable all byco-operation to gain mutual advantages. It was not an act of aggression as somecritics seem to think. It was an act of consolidation. Its purpose was to benefit!all both economically and politically. Naturally, for it to succeed, like every otherhuman institution, it needs forbearance and patience and understanding, but I
say and say again it began and it lives with high and. honourable purposes. I saidthat my main object in undertaking this journey was to see and to learn, and alsoto promise that Britain will play her full part to the best of her ability in helpingyou with your great adventure. There are many millions, hundreds of thousands,who wish to be able to call this country their home, and they have a right to doso. Europeans, Asians, Africans all want to be sure that it will be a country of growing opportunity for their children and their grandchildren. Of course,many of your problems are difficult but the prize is great. If you succeed andI know that you will succeed you will have built in this land of splendidopportunity a new society which will serve as an example of true and enduringpartnership to all the world.DESPATCH FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER,FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALAND(Despatch No. 1) Salisbury, 15th February, 1960.My Lord,I have the honour to report on the visit to the Federation of the Prime Ministerand Lady Dorothy Macmillan.2. The Prime Minister and his party arrived in Salisbury from Nigeria late in the evening of the 18th January. They spent the following two days in Salisbury,devoting one day each to Federal and Southern Rhodesia affairs. They spent aday in Lusaka, a day visiting the Copperbelt and, after making a stop at Kariba,flew to the Victoria Falls for the week-end. After visiting Zomba and Blantyrethey returned to Salisbury on the 26th January and left the following morning forFrancistown on their way to the Union. My wife and I accompanied the PrimeMinister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan throughout their tour. The Prime minister had a number of engagements in addition to those included in the original programme, either because they were arranged subsequently, e.g., meetings with united National Independence Party leaders in Lusaka, with Mr. Dingle Foot inZomba and with Mr. Savanhu and Mr. Wellington Chirwa in Salisbury, or because(as in the case of the meetings with Africans and Mr. Garfield Todd in Salisbury)the local authorities preferred that the engagement should not be given advancepublicity.3. Arrangements for the entire visit were co-ordinated by the federal government in consultation with my Office. They provided a Canadair from theR.R.A.F. V.I.P. flight for the Prime Ministers party, not only for internal flights butalso for the flight to the Union via Francistown. They provided as many R.R.A.F.Dakotas as were required for the internal transportation of the Press, for courierservices or other specific duties. In all the arrangements which they made theywere at once generous and co-operative.4. Although the announcement of the Prime Minister^ visit was warmly welcomed by all sections of the public in the Federation and much pleasure was expressed that he was taking the trouble the first time a United Kingdom PrimeMinister had done so to see the problems of Central Africa for himself, it couldnot have been anticipated that this visit, particularly as it was taking place at socritical a period in the Federation^ history, would pass off as smoothly as it did.5. Before the Prime Minister^ arrival the nervousness of the Federal and southern Rhodesia Governments about the terms of reference of the monckton commission had been revived by Lord Shawcross&apos; reported statement that hewould not (as a member of the Commission) hesitate to recommend secession ifhe thought it to be the right solution. Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whiteheadissued a joint statement describing Lord Shawcross&apos; remarks as deplorable and indicating that they would take the matter up with the Prime Minister immediately on his arrival.6. Secondly, the Prime Minister had been widely misunderstood ormisrepresented as saying at a Press conference in Lagos that the inhabitants of the
two northern Territories would be given the opportunity to decide whetherFederation was beneficial to them. Here, again, was the spectre of secessionrearing its unlovely head.7. In discussions with Ministers and in his main public speech to the RhodesiaNational Affairs Association on the day after his arrival in Salisbury the PrimeMinister gave reassurances on both these points. His plain statement that the function of the Monckton Commission was not to destroy Federation but to advisehow it could best go forward, and that the United Kingdom Government stood bythe Commission^ terms of reference, dispelled the gathering apprehensions on thefirst point.8. His explanation of the Lagos statement in which he quoted its exact wordsto demonstrate that he was merely repeating a pledge made to the people of thenorthern Territories in the House of Commons did much to clear the air on thesecond point. But there is no doubt that the repetition of the pledge by a UnitedKingdom Prime Minister in the middle of Salisbury, and in the course of a more liberal speech than local audiences are accustomed to listen to, had an impactwhich no amount of its repetition in the House of Commons could have. reading the Prime Ministers words* in the context of the need, which he emphasised, tobuild up confidence on all sides before the Federation could become independent,the Press, public and political Parties proceeded to examine and make somewhatconfused and conflicting pronouncements on the implications; the debate is notyet over.9. The Southern Rhodesia division of the Dominion Party were quick off the mark with a well-publicised statement coolly received by Europeans in northern rhodesia that unless the&apos; security of the Europeans in Southern Rhodesia andthe country&apos;s natural resources were assured, the Colony would haye to secedefrom the Federation. Subsequently, the United Federal Party held a meeting ofits Central Executive at which Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead were reported to have given their followers a lecture on the need firmly to countersecessionist talk and show faith and determination in the future. The Pressreported and reflected the disappointment and uncertainty which were evident in political circles. The general consensus of editorial opinion during the visit wasthat the Prime Ministers remarks on the future of Federation left many questionsunanswered and, in particular, offered no clear-cut assurance of the permanency of federation or the security of European interests in it. Without an assurance ofpermanency (such as, it was frequently pointed out, the former Colonial secretary had given) it was thought that the pressures for secession would not slacken andfinancial confidence in the Federation would diminish.10. African reactions to the Prime Minister^ major speech in Salisbury andto his visit as a whole were more uniformly favourable. His Cape Town speechwould also appear to have had a good effect in these quarters. His renewal ofthe pledge given to the northern Protectorates was warmly applauded by the AfricanPress and by Africans generally. It will have done much to restore Africanconfidence in the United Kingdom Government^ intentions and to dispel the fear that dominion status will be granted before Africans can compete on equal politicalterms with Europeans. It remains to be seen whether it will also, as the AfricanPress hoped it would, encourage Africans in the northern Territories to work morepatiently for their ends within the framework of Federation and to abate their demands for secession. In his private discussions with African nationalist leaders in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland the Prime Minister will no doubt have haddirect evidence, if this were needed, that their demand for secession is as strongas ever.11. The chief apprehension felt by politically-conscious Africans before thePrime Minister^ arrival in the Federation was that he would not see enough andas many of themselves, whether in or out of gaol, as to give him a &quot; true &quot; impression of the state of opinion in the country. In Salisbury two or three prominent Africanspublicly chose to refuse invitations to functions held in honour of the PrimeMinister rather than risk giving him or anyone else the impression that they were* &quot; I must, therefore, say . . . that, whatever the outcome of the Monckton Commission and whatever the outcome of the 1960 Conference, Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom will not withdraw their protection from the people of Nyasaland or Northern Rhodesia until their people so desire.&quot;
normally admitted to the buildings in which those functions were being held(Meikles Hotel and the Rhodes cinema). In the event, apart from detainees, thePrime Minister met and had discussions with Africans of every shade of political opinion in all three Territories, including the United National Independence Partyin Northern Rhodesia and the Malawi Congress Party in Nyasaland. In SouthernRhodesia he did not meet the recently formed National Democratic Party, whichin consequence issued a statement on the day of his departure to the effect thathe had &quot; left a trail of racial animosity in the country because he had not met thepeople &quot;. But at the home of Sir Edgar Whitehead (who discreetly withdrew intoanother room) he had already met about 30 Africans, some of whom were as wellequipped to represent the views of politically-conscious Africans as the NationalDemocratic Party, and one of whom at least is subsequently reported as havingjoined that Party, which, though showing promise of rapid growth, could not be saidto be properly established. In fact, the views represented to Mr. Macmillan atthat meeting were almost identical to those which the National Democratic party had said that they hoped to make known to him..12. During his tour of the Federation the Prime Minister made three mainspeeches in Salisbury, Lusaka and Blantyre. As I have indicated, the speech in salisbury produced a somewhat mixed reaction from Europeans in the Federation.But I should mention that in this and in other speeches the Prime Minister didnot neglect to pay tribute to the part played by Europeans in the development ofthe country. His main theme, both in public statements and in private discussions with political leaders, was that confidence must be built up and people of all racesmade to realise that with goodwill it should be possible for their aspirations to besatisfied within the concept and framework of Federation.13. I do not propose in this despatch to give an account of the discussions which the Prime Minister had with Governments or representatives of political parties. Records of these have already been sent to the Commonwealth relations office. Suffice it to say that the Prime Ministers skilful handling of the discussions with the Federal and Southern Rhodesia Cabinets created a much easier atmospherethan I had myself anticipated, though there are signs that on some questionscomplete identity of view was not achieved.14. In discussions with African leaders in the northern Territories and inhis speech at Lusaka, the Prime Minister went to some trouble to explain thepurpose of the Monckton Commission and to encourage people to submit theirviews to it. There have recently been welcome signs that this plea did not fallentirely upon deaf ears.15.- It was inevitable that amongst the crowds of Africans and Europeans whoturned out to greet the Prime Minister there should have been some Africandemonstrators and placard bearers protesting against Federation, the monckton commission, the detention of Dr. Banda, the lack of independence and so forth.But they were not numerous and on the whole they were remarkably good-natured.The noisiest demonstration, which led to the arrest of a few Africans (all of whom were released the same day), was made in Blantyre. It is now the subject of anofficial enquiry, whose findings I shall not attempt to anticipate. But I mustrecord the unfortunate fact that the accounts given in some United Kingdomnewspapers of the incident and of the &quot; brutal &quot; behaviour of the Nyasaland Policehave left a bitter taste in the mouths of the European public throughout theFederation. The accounts are generally held to have been grossly exaggerated andunnecessarily malicious and they have not enhanced the reputation, never high,which the United Kingdom Press enjoys in this country.16. It is still too soon to sum up the results of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit on political thinking and attitudes in this country. Dominion Party followers andthe right-wing element of the U.F.P. have inferred that the safeguards promised by the Prime Minister to the two northern Territories will mean premature Africandomination in the Federal sphere and that any constitutional advance for theFederation must await the pleasure of the African Nationalist leaders. It was, nodoubt, for this reason that Sir Edgar Whitehead made public, at a Press conferencein Salisbury two days after the Prime Ministers departure for the Union, hisconditions for his Governments continuing co-operation in the Federation. these included the removal of the restrictions in the Southern Rhodesia constitution and the establishment of the principle that the Governments of the northern territories must be based on partnership and not on African nationalism.   His
forthright statements must be interpreted as an attempt and a successful one to encourage his own European following and to offset the growing appeal of theDominion Party who have been able to pose, amid present uncertainties, as theonly protector of the white man in Southern Rhodesia.17. The outstanding feature of the Prime Minister^ visit was the tremendousimpact of his personality wherever he went. People in Salisbury are still discussinghis visit and trying to sort out the things he said to get some clue as to their future. But even those who find nothing to give them any comfort agree that itis of the greatest advantage that the Prime Minister has taken this opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of conditions in the Federation and of its problems.From the United Kingdom Governments point of view the advantage is quite clear. The Europeans have been given a great shake-up and have been forcedto pull their heads out of the sand. They have been made to think more seriouslyabout the realities of their situation and this, incidentally, may be helpful to theMonckton Commission.18. In concluding this despatch I should like to record that I have heard very many personal tributes paid to the Prime Minister, and to Lady Dorothy Macmillan,whose ease of manner and lively interest endeared her to everyone she met.19. I am sending copies of this despatch to the United Kingdom high commissioners at Accra and Cape Town, and, on a personal basis, to the governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.I have, &amp;c.M.

PART VUNION OF SOUTH AFRICACOMMENTARYBy far the most important event of the Prime Minister^ visit to South Africawas his speech in Cape Town on 3rd February. The text itself contained nothing which would be considered startling or even novel in the United Kingdom indeedone of the most effective passages was a quotation from a speech made five monthsearlier by the Foreign Secretary at the United Nations. What caused the sensationwas that the Prime Minister should make any reference at all to racial problems in a speech delivered to the two Houses of the South African Parliament andthat he should have chosen this occasion to make a clear and firm statementof British policy in the territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible.Inevitably, all of the visit that went before seemed in retrospect mere preparation,and the reverberations of the speech deprived of all interest the events of theremaining few days which the Prime Minister spent in the Union. It soon became clear that the Cape Town speech was the culmination of the whole African tour.From the point of view of climate and of scenery, South Africa was the mostattractive of the four countries visited. On the other hand it was impossible to escape from an oppressive realisation of the many unsolved and apparentlyinsoluble problems darkening the relations between the races. The visit fellnaturally into two stages. In the first, based on Pretoria, the Prime Ministertravelled widely. He visited the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the NorthernTransvaal, the Rand, Swaziland, Durban, Bloemfontein and Basutoland. He was accompanied on these travels by Mr. Eric Louw and, from time to time, by otherNationalist Ministers. At the same time he met a good many representatives ofdifferent points of view. He was able, for example, to meet prominent industrialistsfrom the Rand, men with open minds and with experience not limited to south Africa. He was able to hear the liberal opinions of such people as sir&apos; Harry Oppenheimer and Mr. Flather, Editor of the Star. When he moved toCape Town, by contrast, his time was almost entirely taken up with discussions with the Nationalist Government and under the predominating influence of theNationalist philosophy of life, though he also met a number of leaders of Capeliberal opinion.Dr. Verwoerd made arrangements for the Prime Minister to see the leadersof those Opposition Parties which were represented in Parliament, i.e., the Unitedand Progressive Parties. His readiness to meet the leaders of the African national congress, who had asked for an interview, as had also certain minor Europeangroups, was opposed by Dr. Verwoerd and his colleagues. They were not moved by the fact that the Prime Minister had, in the other countries visited, shown himselfready to meet all shades of Opposition opinion. He therefore felt obliged to fallin with the wishes of his hosts. He did have a fairly long talk with SenatorMrs. Ballinger, representing African interests, and met the Council for ColouredAffairs, a Government-sponsored body; but this was the first country in africa in which he was denied the opportunity of discussions with African political leaders.The Prime Minister was impressed by the contrast between the ability,enterprise and open-mindedness of the business men and intelligentsia of the transvaal and the doctrinaire and obscurantist attitude of Nationalist Ministers.The Government, who arranged the programme, were plainly anxious, not onlyto show hospitality, but also to convince the Prime Minister that their native policy was both morally sound and practically reasonable. The visit to theNorthern Transvaal Bantu Chiefs, who are pensioners of the Union Government,was designed to persuade him that apartheid was welcome to Africans also. It wasnot convincing enough to be successful. On the other hand, by contrast with what was found in the other territories visited, the general impression which heformed of African attitudes was of a people content with little and politically almostinactive. Such demonstrations as took place were on a minor scale, consisting ofno more than a few people, usually women, displaying placards.The business talks were in a low key and there was no real meeting ofsympathies. It was plain that on the South African side there was a genuinedesire to be understood but no comprehension of how South Africa&apos;s fixedattitudes are regarded by the outside world.   A significant example of this was
that the Union Government apparently believed their unpopularity in africa to derive, not from their own policies, but from the cold attitude shown towards them by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mr. Louw seemed to be convinced that South Africa could form an effective bridge between the western powers and the uncommitted African States if only the former, and particularly the United Kingdom, would show greater sympathy with their policies and objectives.The question of the High Commission Territories was raised; but Dr. Verwoerdmade it clear that he did not intend to press at present for transfer. What movedhim more was the question of the change-over to a republican form of Governmentwhile retaining, at least at the outset, membership of the Commonwealth; and heendeavoured to extract from the Prime Minister some expression of view whichhe could use with advantage in the referendum campaign. Similar efforts weremade by representatives of Nationalist newspapers at the Press conference atCape Town. The Prime Minister refused to lend himself to this and said nothing which could be used to suggest that Britain was indifferent to the question whetherSouth Africa would become a republic.The Prime Minister^ address to the two Houses of Parliament came in themiddle of the talks with Ministers. Although Dr. Verwoerd had been given anidea of its main outlines beforehand, it was plainly a surprise to him and to his supporters. Indeed, he was so struck by the likely effects of the criticism containedin it, though mild and merely implied, that he found it necessary to make animmediate reply putting the case, as he expressed it, for justice for the whiteman. The Cape Town Nationalist paper, the Burger, took an even stronger line and for a week and more after the speech devoted at least one leader to it daily.The general line was that South Africa was now left without supporters in theworld and would have to rely on its own efforts. This was accompanied by agood deal of self-pity and resentment against Britain. The United Party werepleased at what they considered a blow to their Nationalist opponents, althoughsuch criticism as there was in the speech could be applied almost equally well totheir own views on race relations. Liberal opinion was immensely fortified.Above all, the impact of the speech caused a marked quickening of interest in politics on the part of those elements hitherto mainly apathetic. This stirring ofopinion is expected to have important political results, v/hich may possibly affectthe outcome of the referendum.The tour involved a great deal of travelling and some of the daily programmes were extremely strenuous. On the other hand, there was none of that shifting ofbase which had characterised the visits to Nigeria and the Federation; the PrimeMinister^ time was divided between five nights in Pretoria and four nights inCape Town.Except for Durban and Cape Town, there were few large crowds to welcomehim. There would have been, without any doubt, a great turn-out in Johannesburg,but the Union authorities insisted on keeping his time of arrival and route secret,and as a result few people had assembled to greet him. When told of the reasonby the Mayor of Johannesburg, the Prime Minister remarked that the security precautions seemed excessive. The Mayor later made a statement about this tothe Press, which led Mr. Louw to make a counter-statement in which he took itupon himself to apologise for the Mayor&apos;s behaviour. It is a fact, however, thatthe Mayor had unsuccessfully tried to persuade the security authorities to let the route be known in advance. As it was, many hundreds of people guessed correctlythe route by which he left Johannesburg for Pretoria and he was enthusiasticallycheered.This was only one of the facts which contributed to the general impression thatthe Union authorities were not anxious to allow too much enthusiasm to be publicly shown. A great deal of this enthusiasm was indeed a display of feelingby the English-speaking element. This was naturally marked in Durban, wherevery large crowds stood along the whole route from the airport to the King&apos;s House.The farewell in Cape Town was most affecting, both on the route to the docks andon the quayside.The Prime Minister particularly enjoyed his visits to the High commission territories. The arrangements made were excellent and the programmes went offwithout a hitch. Popular enthusiasm was immense, and the people of the three territories were glad to renew their expressions of loyalty to the Queen andattachment to their United Kingdom connexion.

At 12-30 p.m. Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy lunched quietly with theGovernor-General and Mrs. Swart at Stal Plein.33. At. 2 - 30 p.m. Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy left Stal Plein and,accompanied by the Minister of Finance and Mrs. Donges, drove round by SeaPoint, Chapman&apos;s Peak and Fisch Hoek to Groot Constantia, where a tea party was given by the Administrator of Cape Town and Mrs. J. H. O. du Plessis.34. At 8 p.m. Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy attended a State banquetat the Castle in Cape Town given by the South African Government, in the courseof which Dr. Verwoerd made a short speech to which Mr. Macmillan replied.35. Friday, 5th February. At 9-30 a.m. Mr. Macmillan held a press conference in the garden at Groote Schuur.36. After the Press conference Mr. Macmillan had a final private conversation^ with Dr. Verwoerd.37. He and Lady Dorothy were then taken by Dr. Verwoerd to see theRhodes Memorial.38. At 11-45 a.m. Mr. Macmillan had a formal meeting* with representativesof the Council for Coloured Affairs at their headquarters at 84, Harrington Street.39. At 12-15 p.m. Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy went to the Town Hallto a civic luncheon. The Mayor (Mrs. Newton Thompson) introduced them tothe Mayoress (Mrs. Hugo) and leading members of the City Council.At the end of luncheon the Mayor proposed the loyal toast and &quot; God save the Queen &quot; was played an event unusual in the Union. Mr. Macmillan gave the toast of &quot; South Africa &quot;, after which &quot; Die Stemme &quot; was played. The Mayorthen made a speech, in proposing Mr. Macmillan&apos;s health.  Mr. Macmillan replied.40. After the luncheon Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy returned toGroote Schuur for a short rest.41. At 3 -15 p.m., accompanied by Dr. and Mrs. Verwoerd, they left to drivethrough the city to the docks. On this occasion the route had been well publicisedin advance: the main streets were decorated with flags and bunting and lined with large crowds on either side. Mr. Macmillan, who was driving with Dr. Verwoerdin an open car, stood to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd.42. On arrival at the docks Mr. Macmilian took a General Salute andinspected a Guard of Honour mounted by a contingent of the South African AirForce. He and Lady Dorothy then took leave of Dr. and Mrs. Verwoerd,Mr. and Mrs. Louw, the United Kingdom High Commissioner and Lady Maudand a number of other leading personalities. They then went on board theR.M.M.V. Capetown Castle.A large and enthusiastic crowd had assembled on the quayside. While thetugs were going alongside, the crowd sang &quot; For He&apos;s a Jolly Good Fellow &quot;. Asthe lines were cast off the band played &quot; Auld Lang Syne &quot;. After it had marchedoff the crowd spontaneously sang &quot; God Save The Queen &quot;. As the ship movedaway, few of them seemed to leave: a great crowd remained waving and shoutingfor as long as they could see the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillanstanding on the bridge. It was an impressive and moving scene: a fitting andheart-warming end to the Prime Ministers tour.43. Friday, 5th February to Sunday, 14th February. The 10 days spentat sea in R.M.M.V. Capetown Castle gave the Prime Minister an opportunity torest and to review his African tour as a whole. Throughout this period he wasin daily touch with London by telegram and transacted a considerable amount ofUnited Kingdom business.44. Monday, 15th February. At 8 - 25 a.m. Mr. Macmillan received on board the R.M.M.V. Capetown Castle Mr. E. L. Fox (Her Majesty&apos;s Consul, Teneriffe),and Mr. G. Miller (Her Majestys Consul, Las Palmas).At 8-30 a.m. Mr. Macmillan received the following Spanish authorities: .His Excellency Vice-Admiral Don Luis Lallemand Menacho, Vice-admiral commanding the Naval Bases of the Canary Islands.
His Excellency Major-General don Antonio Llop Lamarca, Commander-in-Chief of the Air District of the Gran Canarias.His Excellency Brigadier-General Don Roman Leon Villaverde, military governor and Commander of Troops, Gran Canarias.His Excellency Don Honorato Martin-Cobos Laguera, Civil Governor ofLas Palmas.Don Matias Vega Guerra, President of the Cabildo (i.e., Chairman of theCounty Council).His Excellency Don Jose Ramirez Bettencourt, Alcalde (Mayor) of LasPalmas.His Excellency Lieutenant-General A. Erquicia Aranda, Captain-General ofthe Canary Islands.At 9 a.m. the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan disembarked onto the quay. Mr. Macmillan inspected a Guard of Honour which then marchedpast. After this Mr. Macmiilan&apos;s party travelled by car to the British Club,Las Palmas, where they were received by Mr. I. K. Park, the President of the Club,who made a short address of welcome to which Mr. Macmillan replied.Mr. Macmillan&apos;s party were then driven by car through Las Palmas and through the countryside to the airport. Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy were there greeted by a number of girls in Spanish costume singing national songs andthrowing flowers in their path a gay and colourful scene. Mr. Macmillaninspected another Guard of Honour, took leave of the Spanish authorities and wasairborne in his Britannia aircraft shortly after 11 a.m.^ Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy arrived at London Airport at 5-30 p.m.They were met by the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the commonwealth secretary and a number of other members of the Cabinet. Mr. Macmillan had ashort meeting with representatives of the Press, and then drove to10 Downing Street, where he arrived at 6-45 p.m.
RECORDS OF MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONSRecord of a Discussion held at Groote Schuur, Cape Town, on Tuesday,2nd February, 1960, at 10 a.m.1. AntarcticDr. Verwoerd said that he would like to take this opportunity of expressing the gratitude of the Union Government for the assistance which they had had from the United Kingdom Government in relation to the Antarctic.2. UraniumDr. Verwoerd said that, in view of new discoveries, the world demand for south Africa&apos;s uranium would in future be less than had been expected hitherto.In these circumstances it would be in the common interest of both producers and consumers if the existing contracts, which were due to expire in 1965 or 1966,could be spread out over a rather longer period.Mr. Jooste said that exploratory discussions would shortly be opened, between officials of the United Kingdom and Union Governments, to look into thepossibility of such an arrangement. The Union Government would welcome itin principle, even if it would involve some sacrifice of revenue in the next fewyears. He hoped that these discussions would be conducted in the friendlyatmosphere which had characterised earlier negotiations about uranium contracts.Dr. Verwoerd said that he hoped that the United Kingdom representatives inthese discussions would take a sympathetic view of the difficulties which this situation created for the Union Government.3. Commonwealth Relations: Departmental ResponsibilitiesMr. Louw suggested that the United Kingdom Government should consideradjusting Departmental responsibilities in London so that other commonwealth governments would be able to deal directly with the Foreign Office on foreignaffairs. In principle it seemed desirable that other Commonwealth governments should receive information and advice on these matters directly from the ForeignOffice, instead of through the Commonwealth Relations Office, at second-hand;and also that they should be able to put their views and representations directly to the Foreign Office. He had in the past discussed this question of organisation with the Foreign Ministers of Canada and Australia, and believed that they would both favour such a change. He also had some reason to believe that Mr. SelwynLloyd would not be opposed to it.Mr. Louw went on to cite, in support of his suggestion, three instances inwhich he believed that the interests of the Union Government had been overlookedby the Commonwealth Relations Office. First, in 1956, the Union Governmenthad received no advance information of the Anglo-French decision to undertakemilitary operations against Egypt. Secondly, the United Kingdom Governmenthad been represented at an international conference in Lisbon which considered a number of matters relating to Africa which were of close concern to the UnionGovernment: he had obtained (not from United Kingdom or Portuguese sources)a full report of the proceedings at this conference; and he had been surprised tofind that the United Kingdom representative had resisted a suggestion that, when a further conference of this kind was held, the Union Government should berepresented: at it; Thirdly, he had learned that officials of the United Kingdom,the United States and Canada had recently met in Washington to consider Africanproblems: he thought it strange that the Union Government should not have been invited to participate and even stranger that the Canadians (who had no direct interest in,Africa) should have been asked to send representatives.   .Present:United KingdomSouth AfricaMr. Harold MacmillanSir Norman BrookSir John MaudDr. VerwoerdMr. LouwMr. Jooste
Mr. Macmillan said that in independent Commonwealth countries other thanthe United Kingdom there was usually a single Department of External affairs and a single Foreign Service covering both Commonwealth countries and foreigncountries. In theory it would be possible to adopt the same form of departmental organisation in London; but this would have the practical disadvantage that therewould be no single Minister in the United Kingdom Cabinet with the duty of seeing that Commonwealth interests were not overlooked. The interests of theother Commonwealth countries would not be better served if they were lumpedtogether with all the foreign countries with which the Foreign Secretary was concerned. It was not to be assumed that, because messages came in a commonwealth Relations Office cypher, their content had been settled by that department. The material for these telegrams, and the advice which theycontained, was provided by the Department concerned with the subject matter whether Foreign Office, Treasury, Board of Trade or other Department in whitehall. In this sense the Commonwealth Relations Office was a Post office for conveying the views and advice of specialist Departments. The advice sentto other Commonwealth Governments on foreign affairs certainly came from theForeign Office. Moreover, on matters of major importance, much business wastransacted by messages from Prime Minister to Prime Minister. Finally, inLondon, Commonwealth High Commissioners were not required to do businesssolely through the Commonwealth Relations Office, but were encouraged to godirectly to the Foreign Office and other Whitehall Departments for information and advice.Dr. Verwoerd said that the Union Government did not wish to appear to betelling the United Kingdom Government how to organise their Departmentalbusiness. Nor were they suggesting that the Commonwealth Relations office should be abolished. From their angle, however, they would prefer that theForeign Office should handle relations with other Commonwealth governments on foreign affairs and that the Commonwealth Relations Office should deal only with Commonwealth business.In further discussion Mr. Jooste confirmed, from his own experience as HighCommissioner in London, that Commonwealth High Commissioners were free to deal directly with the Foreign Office on foreign affairs though they were expected to keep the Commonwealth Relations Office informed of these exchanges.There was, however, no direct link between the Foreign Secretary in London andthe Minister for External Affairs in another Commonwealth country.Mr. Macmillan said that he saw no reason of principle why Ministers for external Affairs in other Commonwealth countries should not conduct personalcorrespondence, when required, with the Foreign Secretary just as other commonwealth Prime Ministers conducted personal correspondence with him.He would consider this possibility. On the wider question he thought that the aim should be to have a form of Departmental organisation in London whichwould produce the result that Commonwealth countries had better facilities thanforeign countries for consultation, information and advice. He would consider this question of organisation further, in the light of this discussion. It might befound convenient to have some talk about it at the forthcoming meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers in London.4. The Position of the Union Government in AfricaDr. Verwoerd said that important changes were taking place in Africa, andthe Union Government were anxious to play their full part in guiding these indirections which would be helpful to the West. It was right that the Union should play this part; for it was, as it were, the resident representative of Europeancivilisation in Africa. It was in a good position to assist the development of otherAfrican States, and was in fact already doing so. It was playing its full part inthe Commission pour la Co-operation Technique en Afrique (C.C.T.A.) and inthe Foundation pour 1&apos;Assistance Mutuelle en Afrique (F.A.M.A.); and, outsidethe work of these international organisations, it was also giving a good deal of help and advice in relation to agriculture, broadcasting, scientific development and administration. Unhappily, however, its influence with the other African states was being seriously impaired by lack of support from the United Kingdom and theUnited States.   This was doubtless due to disapproval of the internal policies
of the Union a matter which he would discuss privately with Mr. Macmillan.But it was unfortunate that this should prevent those countries from appreciatingthe desire of the Union Government to assist in the development of the african states and the extent to which they were already doing so. South Africa was devoted to the Western cause, from conviction not from self-interest: her wholeoutlook was bound up with that of the West and she would remain firmly in theWestern camp, however much her motives might be misunderstood. She wasthe one solid foundation in Africa on which the West could build. Yet the Westwere losing these opportunities because of their dislike of the internal policies ofthe Union Government. If the United Kingdom and the United States could show greater confidence in what the Union Government were trying to do tofurther the Western cause throughout Africa, they would thereby increase theinfluence which the Union could bring to bear on other African States.Mr. Louw said that he would like to make the same point in its politicalcontext. The main need of the emergent States in Africa was for economic aid;and there was at present something like a competition to gain the influence whichthe grant of aid could bring. Some of the countries offering aid had ulteriormotives: he was not sure that the Americans might not have commercial motives,and it was evident that Russia and Egypt had ideological motives. If we wished the new African States to work with the West, we must provide them with a link.The Union, as a white Government in Africa, could provide this link, if only theprejudices against the Union in the new African States could be overcome. Atpresent those prejudices were being fed by statements made by the Press and by political leaders in the United Kingdom and the United States. The attitude ofpublic opinion in those countries was frustrating the attempts of the UnionGovernment to help the other African States and to bind them more closely tothe Western cause.The Union Government themselves were doing what they could to overcomethese prejudices for example, special arrangements had been made to enablenext year&apos;s conference of trie C.C.T.A. to be held in South Africa. The UnionGovernment looked to the United Kingdom Government to help in overcomingthese prejudices. The United Kingdom Governments support for South Africa,in her difficulties in the United Nations, had been helpful. Mr. Macmillan could also help by telling the British public, from his personal experience, what was being done for Africans in the Union they were not in fact &quot; having it so bad &quot;.Dr. Verwoerd said that extreme expressions of sympathy for the Africanwould make the task of the Union Government impossible. They were to-day inthe same position as the United Kingdom had been in recent years in carryingout their Colonial policy under a heavy fire of criticism of &quot; Colonialism &quot;. Whenthe United Kingdom were under this criticism, they had received sympathy and support from the Union. It would be helpful if the United Kingdom could nowshow a more sympathetic understanding of the motives and intentions of the UnionGovernment in Africa.Mr. Macmillan said that, after the secession of the North American Colonies,British Colonialism had been concerned mainly with territories in which british people had never had any intention of settling. In most of our Colonies we had reluctantly accepted the responsibility of administration as a consequence of our desire to trade; and our intention had always been to transfer that responsibility to the inhabitants as soon as they were fit to undertake it. Sometimes we mighthave done so. too quickly; the two wars of the twentieth century had forced the pace. But, whatever might be said on the question of timing, he had no doubtthat, in countries where there was a homogeneous population, our policy shouldbe to concede self-government and independence as soon as the inhabitants were ready for it. There were, however, within the Colonial Empire a few territorieswhere this policy could not be followed because the population was nothomogeneous. For us, this problem was most acute in Central and East Africa,where there were many European settlers who had no other home. Here wewere confronted with the same problem, on a smaller scale, as that which existed in the Union. There were two possible approaches to this problem. The UnionGovernment had chosen to follow the policy of separate development. The United-Kingdom; Government, on the other hand, had thought it right to work for thecreation of a non-racial State, in which all the communities would have a share in the government.  It was too early to say whether this could succeed; but the
Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland still believed that itwas the right solution. It might also be relevant to recall the nearest foreigncomparison-Algeria, a white country in North Africa, with about a millionFrench settlers. It now began to look as though the French had lost their strugglein Algeria. If they had, it was certainly not for lack of courage or for lack ofmaterial strength and expenditure. If the experiment did fail, its failure wouldbe due to the fact that they had tried to hold down an indigenous population by force. Mr. Macmillan said that on this question the Governments of the union and of the United Kingdom took a quite different view. He feared that they wouldnot be able to find a basis for agreement about it. What they could do, however,was to try to remove the bitterness from the controversy. Matters would becomeworse if each side imputed dishonourable motives to the other. If they could not agree on the substance, they could at least agree to discuss it coolly and objectively.The countries of the West were, after all, in great danger. Apart from theimmediate threat from the Soviet Union, there loomed beyond it a possibly greaterdanger from China, which would have a population of 800 millions by 1970. Thecountries of the West, if they were to survive, would be well advised to try tounderstand one another&apos;s difficulties and hold together despite differences ofopinion on particular issues.Dr. Verwoerd said that he could not believe that a non-racial State was a practicable solution in a multi-racial community. If the French failed in Algeria,it would be because they had aimed at creating a non-racial State. Once you setfoot on that road, you had to travel it to the end which, in Africa, meantdomination by Africans. That was why the Union preferred the alternative of enabling the two communities to live together as neighbours, not as one family.However, all that lay in the future. The immediate problem was to find meansof preventing the new African States from falling under Communist influence.The Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States could bestcontribute to this by showing confidence in the good faith of the Union Governmentand the genuineness of their desire to assist in the development of the otheremergent States in Africa.5. United Nations(a) Security CouncilMr. Louw, after describing the history of the Union&apos;s candidature for theCommonwealth seat on the Security Council, said that the Union Government, while they had hitherto been content that this seat should be held by one of the other commonwealth countries, were now determined to secure it for themselves in 1961.They recognised, however, that if the Commonwealth vote were split this mightdestroy the convention that one of the non-permanent seats was always held bya Commonwealth country; and they were anxious to have the support of theUnited Kingdom Government in avoiding that situation.After discussion it was agreed that the United Kingdom Government should now approach the Governments of the older Commonwealth countries and seek to secure their agreement to support the Union&apos;s candidature in 1961. If their support could be secured, the Prime Ministers of the other Commonwealth countries could be consulted when they were in London for the Commonwealth meeting inMay. These latter consultations would be carried out informally: it would not be expedient that the matter should be raised formally at a plenary session of themeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. If at that time Mr. Nehru agreedthat India would support the Union&apos;s candidature, he might be willing to persuadeDr. Nkrumah to withdraw Ghana&apos;s application so as to avoid a split in theCommonwealth vote.Dr. Verwoerd said that he would like to assure Mr. Macmillan that, if theUnion became a Republic and did not remain within the Commonwealth, theUnion Government would at once vacate the Commonwealth seat on the security council.(b) South-West AfricaMr. Louw described the dealings which the Union Government had had withthe Good Offices Committee appointed by the United Nations to seek a wayout of the difficulties which had arisen between the Union and the United Nations
in respect of South-West Africa. The Union Government would have beenready to consider the possibility of a partition, by which one part of the territory would be incorporated in the Union and the other placed under United Nationstrusteeship. The United Nations had, however, been unwilling to consider sucha solution; and the second report of the Good Offices Committee contemplated anarrangement by which the whole of the territory would be placed under united nations supervision. The Union Government were not prepared to accept that situation. As a result, the Afro-Asian group were now canvassing in the united nations the possibility of applying sanctions against the Union. These might take the form of a boycott of South African goods, or withdrawal of diplomatic representatives from the Union, or restrictions on the use of international airportsby South African aircraft. If any such proposal were made at the Security Council,the Union Government hoped that it would be vetoed by the United Kingdomand France. But it was possible that the matter might be brought to the Assemblyunder the &quot; uniting for peace &quot; Resolution and, in that event, it might obtain a two-thirds majority.Dr. Verwoerd said that this was a matter of vital importance to the UnionGovernment, who were not prepared to accept United Nations supervision overthe whole of South-West Africa.Mr. Macmillan said that, as he understood it, the International Court had given an advisory opinion against the view taken by the Union Government onthe legal issue.Mr. Jooste said that, while this was so, the opinion was somewhat obscure.While the Court had taken the view that the Union Government was accountable to the United Nations in respect of South-West Africa, they had not found thatthe Union was under a legal obligation to put the territory under trusteeship.And the Union Government had in fact been willing to consider placing part ofthe territory under trusteeship. They had also offered to submit information aboutthe territory to members of the old League of Nations.Mr. Macmillan asked whether there was not some risk that the international court would be asked to give a definitive judgment on this issue.Mr. Louw said that there was a risk of this, for the Union had accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. In that event, however, he hoped thatthe judgment would give supervision, not to the United Nations, but to someformer member of the old League of Nations.(c) Internal PoliciesMr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government, while continuing to adhere to the principle of Article 2 (7) of the Charter, were finding it increasingly difficult to vote against the inscription on the Assembly agenda of items relatingto the internal policies of the Union Government. None of the other commonwealth Governments now supported us in voting against the inscriptionof such items: we were now alone in doing so: and he thought it right to warn the Union Government that we might not be able to continue to do so. We might find it necessary, on future occasions, merely to obstain from voting on thisquestion.Mr. Jooste said that it would be preferable if the United Kingdom Governmentcould declare that they would not participate in the discussion, with an explanation of their reasons for non-participation.Mr. Macmillan said that the Complexities of United Nations procedure mightoffer the possibility of some way out; but he doubted whether the United KingdomGovernment could again register a positive vote against the inscription of this item.Dr. Verwoerd said that the Union Government, while they had preferredhitherto to stand on the principle of Article 2 (7), had prepared a damaging case against other countries (including the United States) in which racial discriminationwas practised. If they found themselves alone in the United Nations, they mightbe forced to change their tactics and go over to the offensive on the substance ofthis question.Mr. Louw added that some countries were now arguing that Articles 55 and 57of the Charter, which dealt with human rights, contained an implied authority
for the United Nations to discuss the internal affairs of a member country. He had,however, looked up the records of the San Francisco Conference and had verifiedhis recollection that, when these Articles were discussed in draft, Mr. Foster Dulleshad made it plain that they could not be used as a means of getting round theprohibition in Article 2 (7).6. Procedure(a) Future MeetingsIt was agreed that a further meeting should be held on the evening of3rd February to discuss:(i) The High Commission Territories.(ii) The world situation.The two Prime Ministers would meet alone on the morning of 4th February todiscuss:(iii) The Republic issue and the Commonwealth.(iv) Representation of South Africa at the next meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers.(b) PressDr. Verwoerd said that he assumed that there would be no public disclosure of the substance of the conversations which he was holding with Mr. Macmillan.Even disclosure of the subjects discussed would be embarrassing to the UnionGovernment.Mr. Macmillan said that he had no intention of disclosing publicly what had passed in these private discussions. If he were asked about them at the press conference which he was holding on 5th February, or at any other time, he wouldtake the line that these were private discussions and that he had nothing to sayabout them.Record of a Discussion between Mr. Macmillan and Sir de Villiers Graaff, heldin Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s Room in the Assembly Building, Cape Town, on Wednesday,3rd February, 1960, at 11-35 a.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Mr. T. J. Bligh.After the usual exchange of courtesies Mr. Macmillan asked Sir de VilliersGraaff if he would like to say what were the main differences between the united party and the Nationalists.Sir de Villiers Graaff said that these could be summed up as follows:(1) The Nationalists stood for sectional interests whereas the United Partytried to represent the whole country.(2) The Nationalists were in favour of State management and State control:the United Party stood for free enterprise.(3) The United Party wanted a steady flow of immigration. They hoped thatwith a rise in the natural increase of the white population and a large increase in immigration the Union would be able by the turn of thecentury to have a larger white population than black, and this wouldsolve a number of problems. The Nationalist Party were anxious tocontrol immigration; they would not accept Roman Catholics and couldnot attract as many British people as they would like. Moreoverimmigrants would not necessarily vote for the Nationalists.(4) The United Party attached more importance than the Nationalists to thedignity of the individual. Some of the Governments recent legislationhad been very restrictive. -(5) The two Parties differed fundamentally on their approach to Africans. TheUnited Party believed that there must be some consultation with the
non-Europeans and thought that it was essential that the non-Europeanview should be constantly before Parliament. The Nationalists didnot accept any of this.(6) The United Party were opposed to the idea of a Republic and thought thatthe way the republican issue was being handled might cause deepbitterness in the country.In further discussion the following points emerged:(a) The United Party found it very difficult to get all their supporters to thepolls. The English-speaking section of the community seemed to beapathetic about elections.(b) The United Party had reminded Dr. Verwoerd that he would have to apply for South Africa&apos;s readmission to the Commonwealth on a change ofthe constitution. This did not appear to have occurred to the nationalists.(c) There was a low standard of awareness of world problems in South Africa.It was true that a considerable number of South Africans travelledabroad, especially the younger people. But they made little effort to relate South African problems to the problems of other countries, even within Africa.(d) The United Party had lost the 1948 election by four seats, although theyhad had a majority of the votes cast. Since then the Nationalists hadgerrymandered the constituencies and although they secured only halfthe votes they had established a firm hold on the country.(e) The United Party&apos;s task of opposition had been made no easier by thesplintering off of the Progressive Party. It was extremely unlikely thatthis party would win a single seat in the next General Election.(/) If the United Party were ever to get a chance of forming a government they must attract votes from the moderate Nationalists: they had,therefore, to be realistic.(g) Sir de Villiers Graaff said that he had argued that if South Africa left theCommonwealth they would lose free entry and preferential treatment in British markets. But apparently the United Kingdom trade commissioner had gone round to Dr. Verwoerd subsequently and saidthat this would not necessarily happen at all. Mr. Macmillan said hewould ask the High Commissioner to look into this. It was mostimportant that no commitments should be made at this stage.In conclusion Sir de Villiers Graaff congratulated Mr. Macmillan on the speechhe had just made to the Members of both Houses. He thought that this wouldhave a good effect throughout the country.Record of a Discussion with Leaders of the Progressive Party, held inDr. Verwoerd&apos;s Room in the Assembly Building, Cape Town, on Wednesday,3rd February, 1960, at 12 15 p.m.Mr. Macmillan was accompanied by Mr. T. J. Bligh.The representatives of the Progressive Party were Mr. Steytler andMr. Lawrence.Mr. Macmillan welcomed the leaders of the Progressive Party and, after theusual exchange of courtesies, the following points were made in discussion:(a) The present strength of the Progressive Party in the House was 12.Eleven of these had originally belonged to the United Party. the progressive Party hoped to increase their strength by recruits from theLiberal Party.(b) The Liberal Party were the first Radical Party in the field but their policieswere totally unrealistic. The real point of difference between theLiberal Party and the Progressive Party was in their approach to the
universal franchise. The former wanted to, introduce this at once,which was clearly impracticable.(c) The Progressive Party had started when Dr. Verwoerd had put forwardhis New Vision, which had led to the setting up of Bantustans. this idea had been rejected by the United Party but they had not put forwardany constructive alternative to it. The Progressives had felt it necessary,if partition were to be opposed, to accept overtly the multi-racial State.Their three main points were:(i) Real consultation with representative Africans.(ii) The extension of political rights.(iii) Participation by non-Europeans in the House.These ideas were not acceptable to the United Party, and the progressive Party had come into being as a result.(d) The Progressive Party were making some headway with their localorganisations. They did not of course enjoy the benefit of the united party machine in any of their constituencies.(e) The main issue on which they differed from the Government was the colour question. They thought it utterly wrong to make a dogmaticapproach to this problem; what was needed was a cautious advance atthe highest acceptable rate. On the other hand the principle of &quot; one man one vote &quot; was equally inapplicable in practice.(/) The Progressive Party were worried at the high rate of emigration ofeducated Africans. If this continued, the African community in theUnion would reap no benefit from the growth in educational facilities.(g) The Progressive Party believed that most of the intellectual Nationalistsrealised that apartheid could not work. The Government themselvesrecognised that the 3 million Africans employed by the farming community were essential to the economy of the country but they took the view that these Africans could exercise their political rights in theirown territories. This was disingenuous since most of the Africansconcerned had been de-tribalised and had no home territory.(h) It was possible that Mr. Louw was beginning to recognise the need for the nationalists to change their racial policy He had recently indicatedacceptance of the view that the Union must try to exercise someinfluence on the emerging black countries in Africa, and that theycould not do this if their own internal policies rendered them open tosevere criticism from those countries.Record of a Discussion held at Groote Schuur, Cape Town, on Wednesday,3rd February, 1960, at 8 50 p.m.1. World situation at Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s request Mr. Macmillan gave a review of the state of relations between East and West, with special reference to the problem of Germany.The Soviet pronouncement of November 1958 had been in effect an ultimatumand had created a very dangerous situation. There was then a serious risk thatthe world might drift into war, as it had done in 1914. It was on this accountthat he had taken the initiative of making his visit to Moscow. Since then a yearhad been spent in visits and discussions between leading statesmen of East and west. These discussions had not perhaps gone very deep, but they had at leastbought time and averted conflict.Present:United KingdomSouth AfricaMr. Harold MacmillanSir Norman BrookSir John MaudDr. VerwoerdMr. LouwMr. Jooste
Berlin was the symptom, rather than the cause, of tension in Europe, but itmight easily provide the spark to touch off a general conflagration. The western countries were not in a strong position to defy the Soviet Government over Berlin.For, in the last resort, Mr. Khrushchev could make a peace treaty with eastern germany and invite us to deal with the East Germans on all matters relating toour rights of passage through their territory to Berlin. In such circumstances,though our juridical position might be strong, our practical position would be weak;for the British public would certainly not be willing to risk a world war over thequestion whether a German official or a Soviet official stamped the documentscarried by a convoy passing through East German territory to Berlin. This wasnot the sort of issue on which a democracy.could be persuaded to go to war. Wehad therefore done our best to negotiate some temporary arrangement aboutBerlin, and agreement had very nearly been reached at the meeting of foreign ministers in 1958. These negotiations had eventually broken down in a somewhatlegalistic debate as to what the position would be at the end of the temporaryperiod. It was hard to know what value Mr. Khrushchev put upon this point:it might be that he was determined that a final decision should be reserved for aSummit meeting.In all this the fundamental difficulty lay in differences of view about thereunification of Germany. Dr. Adenauer, though he realised that reunificationcould not come for many years, was determined that nothing should be done to prejudice the possibility. The Russians, on the other hand, were determined to keepGermany divided for ever for their main fear now was the threat which a reunitedGermany would present to their security. Their aim was to get Eastern Germanyrecognised as an independent State, like Poland. For the present at any rate wemust resist this, for it might tend to detach Western Germany from the Westernalliance. Dr. Adenauer and General de Gaulle were inclined to think that, if westood firm, the Russians would accept some temporary arrangement about Berlin.The United Kingdom and United States Governments, on the other hand, realised that the Western position in Berlin was highly vulnerable and could easily be undermined without the use of force: they were therefore very conscious of the dangers involved in following what was in effect a policy of bluff. If the bluffwere called, the West would suffer a humiliating diplomatic defeat. It might therefore be wiser to be ready to make small concessions in order to get some temporary arrangement. Meanwhile, time had been gained, and tempers hadcooled, as a result of the negotiations over the past year.In discussion the following points were made.(a) Would the situation become easier as the Russians became moreapprehensive about China?Mr. Macmillan said that Mr. Khrushchev was probably a little apprehensivealready about the Chinese, who were inclined to follow reckless policies whichmight interfere with his plans e.g., for securing a measure of disarmament. Butit would probably be some years before China&apos;s strength imposed any substantialrestraint on Soviet policy.(b) Would it not be preferable to accept a permanent division of Germanyand to recognise East Germany on the basis of some readjustment of boundarieswhich would deal with the problem of Berlin?Mr. Macmillan said that Dr. Adenauer could not hope to sustain his political position unless he continued to affirm his faith in the ultimate reunification ofGermany. It was in our interest that Western Germany should be retained inthe Western camp; and, if the West Germans felt that their interests had been abandoned by the West, their morale might break and they might yield to the temptation of buying unification at the cost of a neutrality which would leave them at the mercy of the Soviet bloc. As regards the adjustment of boundaries,it must be remembered that Berlin was about 150 miles east of the boundary and could not be brought within Western Germany without something in the natureof a Danzig corridor, which would be a source of continuing friction and danger.(c) Must it not be assumed, from youth parades and other evidence, that the younger generation in Eastern Germany had been fully converted to Communism?Mr. Macmillan said that he doubted whether this was so. If it were, theRussians would not be so completely unwilling to contemplate the possibility of free elections. , . 1
(d) Would the Western Powers be able to make any:concessions about west berlin without fatally weakening their position there?Mr. Macmillan said that, if we took the alternative course of refusing to try to reach any accommodation, the Russians could make our position in Berlinentirely untenable whenever they chose. -2. High Commission Territories(i) GeneralDr. Verwoerd said that for the last 50 years it had been understood that theHigh Commission Territories would eventually be incorporated within the Union,The United Kingdom Government had always held that the transfer could not take place until the inhabitants had been consulted and the Parliament at westminster had expressed its views. Before the war it had been agreed that theUnion Government would be given an opportunity to explain the position to theinhabitants, so that they would be aware of what was involved before anything in the nature of a plebiscite was held. Since the war, however, successive governments in the United Kingdom had adopted a wholly negative attitude onthis question. Moreover, a new development was now beginning; for measuresof constitutional advance were being introduced in the Territories without anyconsultation with the Union Government. It was possible that this might havethe result that it would become even more difficult to arrange for the territories to be incorporated within the Union. The Union Government therefore found it a matter for regret that they had not been consulted before these constitutional changes were introduced. Dr. Verwoerd thought it his duty to register a protestover this and to ask that no further constitutional changes should take place within the Territories without prior consultation with the Union Government^In discussion the following points were made.(a) Sir John Maud said that the Act of 1909 did not itself include any-undertaking that the Territories would be incorporated within the Union.Dr. Verwoerd said that this might be so; but the negotiations held in 1937-39between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Union had clearlycontemplated that responsibility for the Territories would ultimately be transferredto the Union.Mr. Macmillan said that much had happened since then. In particular,domestic legislation enacted in the Union had affected the attitude of publicopinion, in the United Kingdom and throughout the world, on the question whether further African populations should be brought within the responsibility of theUnion Government.Dr. Verwoerd said that if one party to an agreement wished to pursue acourse of policy inconsistent with that agreement, the other party had a right to expect that at least it would be consulted.Mr. Macmillan replied that the Union Government had not consulted theUnited Kingdom Government before introducing the legislation to which he had referred.(b) Mr. Macmillan asked whether the Union Government had any particularobjection to the constitutional changes recently introduced in Basutoland.Dr. Verwoerd said that he was not taking any particular point on the detailof these changes. He was making the general point that they should not havebeen introduced without prior consultation with the Union Government.(c) Dr. Verwoerd said that he would be glad to know what the presentintentions of the United Kingdom Government were in respect of the high commission Territories. If all thought of incorporation within the Union had been abandoned, was it intended that they should become independent States? So longas the policy of the United Kingdom Government remained obscure, this wouldbe a bone of contention between the Union and the United Kingdom and wouldbe a continuing source of friction.Mr. Macmillan concluded this part of the discussion by saying that he took note of Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s protest that constitutional changes had been introducedwithin the Territories without prior consultation with the Union Government.: &apos;
(ii) Economic SituationDr. Verwoerd said that it was the general desire of the Union Governmentto help the emergent African States. They were already, in a sense, the economicguardians of the inhabitants of the High Commission Territories which, naturally,were economically interdependent with the Union. They were, however, concerned at the development of European industries within the Territories; for this, ifcontinued, would produce a situation inconsistent with the policy of separatedevelopment which was being pursued within the Union and was bound on that account to lay up trouble for the future. Another difficulty facing the UnionGovernment was that they could not continue indefinitely to provide employment for the surplus population of the Territories at a time when the African populationWithin the Union was increasing. In the Union their solution for this problem wasto create industries on the borders of the areas reserved for Africans so as toprovide employment for the growing population. This solution could not however be applied in respect of the Territories unless there were closer co-ordination ofthe economic and social policies followed in the Union and in the Territoriesrespectively. The Union Government could make these Territories viableeconomically if they were able to guide their economic development and harmoniseit with that of the Union itself.Mr. Macmillan said that he would take note of what Dr. Verwoerd had said on the economic aspects of this problem.(iii) Future PolicyDr. Verwoerd said that he recognised the strength of the prejudices held, inthe Parliament at Westminster, and by world opinion at large, against the internalpolicies of the Union Government. This being so, he recognised that the UnitedKingdom Government, even if they wished to do so, would not be able at present to transfer to the Union Government the responsibility for the High commission territories. He was not therefore asking for early transfer. For the present hewould go no further than to ask that the Union Government should be free totell the inhabitants of those Territories what their position would be if they wereincorporated within the Union what political and social systems would beintroduced, and what prospects of economic development there would be. TheUnion Government could, if they chose, conduct a campaign of propaganda forthis purpose without the consent of the United Kingdom Government. They didnot wish to take that course. They would prefer to proceed in co-operation withthe United Kingdom authorities. But they did feel strongly that they ought notto be denied the opportunity to put the facts plainly before the inhabitants of the territories so that they would be able, when the time came, to make an informedchoice. In short, the plea of the Union Government for 1960 was, notincorporation, but co-operation.: Mr. Macmillan said that Dr. Verwoerd would not expect him to give animmediate answer to this request. He would however consider it with his cabinet colleagues after his return to London.Record of a Discussion between the Prime Minister and Dr. Verwoerd at GrooteSchuur, Cape Town, on Thursday, 4th February, 1960, at 10 a.m.1. High Commission TerritoriesDr. Verwoerd began by reiterating the points he had made in the earlier discussion of 3rd February. He said that the Union was the economic guardian ofthe Territories and we were the political guardian. He still thought the time had come for us to- hand over the political guardianship. He recognised, however, thatthe British Parliament and public opinion might not be able to swallow this. he therefore made a strong plea that we should consult together and that any steps which we took on the political side should be taken in consultation, and if possiblein agreement with the Union Government.He went on to say, and he repeated all this at the end of the conversation whichranged over a wide field, that if we used the Colonial Development Fund to set up
European-controlled industries in the Territories which would lead to competition,the Union would have to take measures to protect their industries. I referred to existing imports from Hong Kong, and reminded him that he was bound by GATTand the Ottawa Agreements. He said that he realised this but that the Union would act to defend herself if necessary. He said again and again that, if we would onlyrealise that his whole policy was to benefit the African population while protecting the European, we would be able to co-operate. He wished.to avoid unpleasantnessin the future but warned me that unpleasantness would grow.2. The RepublicHe spoke about the Republic. I said that this was nothing to do with me. It was for him to tender advice to The Queen as Her Prime Minister of South Africa. Heseemed rather nettled about this. I said again that it was nothing to do with me, andI assumed that he had consulted The Queen. He said that he had not done so, andhe gave me a copy of his speech of 3rd December and said that it was hypotheticalonly. I said that it might be hypothetical but I understood that the plebiscite was likely to take place in August, and everybody was registering for it. He seemedupset. He said it was all hypothetical and he would act correctly when the time came. He then went into a long discourse, with his usual fluency and high levelof argument, to prove that if only the final question between Afrikaans and Britishtradition could be resolved it would remove all unpleasantness and allow the countryto go forward as a single nation. That was his purpose. He believed that manyindustrialists and others of British descent would welcome the settlement of thismatter. I said that this might be so, but he could not expect me as The Queen&apos;first Minister of the United Kingdom to be enthusiastic about the end of the monarchy in South Africa. He then adopted a rather hurt attitude and said we quitemisunderstood him. His only aim was to make concessions all round and to reach a peaceful settlement of a long-standing dispute. I again said that this was nothing to do with me as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and that all I could dowas to take note of what he had said.3. The Republic and the CommonwealthDr. Verwoerd said that he thought it would ease things very much if at thetime that the plebiscite was held, whenever that might be, it was indicated that itwas the wish of South Africa to stay in the Commonwealth. Five-sixths of his ownParty would favour this, although one-sixth would be hostile. But, apart from othermatters, he wanted to know whether we really wanted South Africa to remain inthe Commonwealth. I replied that everything I had said since I had been in Africamade it clear that I regarded the Commonwealth as of permanent value not as the setting sun of British imperialism, but as the dawn of an entirely new concept andI hoped that South Africa would play her full part in it. I had made it clear thatour partnership within the Commonwealth might continue for many years whenother questions had been resolved in one way or another.,^ He took all this quitewell. I think it is likely that he will say that he wants to stay in the Commonwealth,if only to get a good vote in the plebiscite.4. Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; ConferenceDr. Verwoerd said that it would be very difficult for him to come to the next meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers because of his other commitments. Hecould only come if he could tell his people that the subjects he would discuss were so important that he could not be represented by a substitute. He asked me whether thought it would be wise for him to raise the Republican issue in May. Since the meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers took place only about every two years,and on the assumption that the Republic came into being between two meetings,would it be wise to raise the question informally and hypothetically in order to testthe opinion of the other members on the question whether South Africa, should shebecome a Republic, could continue within the Commonwealth? I felt that there might be a catch in this and said I would think about it and let him know my view.The point he made was that, if it was settled more or less informally, then when thetime came no more would be needed to complete the formalities than an exchange of correspondence. He had noticed that Ghana had already notified theCommonwealth Prime Ministers of their intention to become a Republic. I simplysaid I would consider this and let him have my advice. The catch in this is, I think,SECRE&apos;1
that he means to get us all to agree that a Republican South Africa could stay in theCommonwealth, use this for his plebiscite campaign, and leave himself free at anytime to find new difficulties.My conclusion is that he wants me to press him very hard to come to the Maymeeting on the understanding that we will (a) discuss the Commonwealth Republicproblem, and (b) make some further agreement with him about the Territories. Hewill make the excuse that these two matters would enable him to miss someceremonies in the Union, but 1 think it is his usual method of bringing pressure. I did observe to him that, if all the 11 Prime Ministers had to find some special reason why they should come to London for a Commonwealth meeting, things wouldbecome rather difficult. He turned this off with a laugh and said that this was aspecial year for South Africa. In any event they had always made it clear thatmeetings in the first half of the year were very difficult for them.5. The Queen&apos;s Position as Head of the CommonwealthDr. Verwoerd said that there was still a strong feeling in South Africa againstrecognising The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. I said I was rather amazedat this. It seemed to me that, if he really believed in reconciliation, it was prettyungenerous to the 45 per cent, of British people in South Africa, to whom the endof the Monarchy would be a serious blow, if he now tried to avoid recognising the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. If he wanted reconciliation, here wasa gesture which would do exactly what he said he wished. He hummed and ha-eda bit at this and said there was still a great feeling in South Africa against the monarchy and it would be a help for future relations if this could be removed. Hethen began to talk about Ireland. I pointed out that this was not relevant:Mr. De Valera had accepted the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth and ireland had left the Commonwealth for different reasons under Mr. Costello. He thentalked about Cyprus. I said that I thought Cyprus was another matter. Thequestion there was whether a country whose policy was more or less under theprotection of two foreign Powers could be regarded as fully independent andqualified for Commonwealth membership. He acquiesced in this and said no more,but expressed his pleasure at getting my view frankly.Record of a Meeting with the Council for Coloured Affairs held at Cape Townon 5th February, 1960, at 11-45 a.m.Present:United Kingdom South AfricaMr. Harold Macmillan Mr. J. F. Naude, Minister of the InteriorMr. D. W. S. Hunt Mr. P. W. Botha, Deputy Minister of the. J. E. R. Wyndham InteriorMr. du Plessis, Secretary of the Depart-ment of Coloured AffairsMembers of the Council for ColouredAffairs(Note. This meeting was arranged at the particular request of the UnionGovernment and at very short notice. The Prime Minister was only asked on thepreceding evening whether he would be ready to meet the Council. Many of its members had to be brought to Cape Town by a special effort made by the UnionGovernment.The Council is constituted in accordance with the Separate Representation of voters&apos; Act, 1956. It is composed entirely of coloured people, 12 elected (all fromCape Province) and 15 nominated by the Government. In the event 24 of the 27attended. Its functions are mainly advisory. All jjolitical organisations of thecoloured people boycotted the Council.)Mr. Macmillan was met on arrival at the office of the Coloured AffairsDepartment by, the Minister of the Interior, Mr. Naude, who introduced his deputy, Mr. Botha, and the Permanent Secretary, Mr. du Plessis.  He was then
taken to a separate entrance leading to a semi-basement room, where the colouredmembers of the Council were assembled. Introduced by Mr. du Plessis he shookhands with all those present.Arrangements had been made for the proceedings to be recorded by the SouthAfrica Broadcasting Corporation but at Mr. Macmillan&apos;s request this was cancelled.Some representatives of the Union Press were present.The proceedings opened with a speech read by Mr. Naude which set out theGovernments programme of social benefits for the coloured people. After thisMr. du Plessis spoke briefly on the work of his Department. A speech of welcomeWas then made by the (coloured) Chairman of the Council. He expressed thegratitude of the coloured people for what the Union Government were doing forthem. He claimed that they had a particular right to the sympathy and supportof both white communities in South Africa, in particular because of the willingand loyal support they had always given in war.Mr. Macmillan replied in an ex tern pore speech. He said that he was very glad to have been given this opportunity of meeting the coloured people and he wished his remarks to be taken as being addressed, not only to their statutoryrepresentatives whom he saw before him, but also to all coloured people in whateverorganisations &quot;and associations they might have formed for themselves. He saidthat he was conscious of the difficulties facing all communities in Southern africa and that they should remember that even greater difficulties had been overcome inthe past by their forefathers. He ended by extending an expression of continuedgood will from the people of the United Kingdom.The members of the Council, who appeared visibly affected by Mr. Macmillan&apos;saddress, rose to their feet as soon as he had finished and sang &quot; Die Stem vanSuid-Afrika &quot;.Afterwards Mr. Macmillan chatted informally with the members of theCouncil and gave a number of autographs.  He left at 12-20 p.m.Note on Suggested Meetings with Representatives of African National congress and other Parties not Represented in Union parliament before he arrived in the Union, Mr. Macmillan had been asked to receivedeputations from the African National Congress, the Liberal Party and a numberOf other organisations not represented in the Union Parliament. The fact that hehad received these requests was widely known among newspaper correspondents,and it was evident that, if he did not see representatives of any of these organisations, there was likely to be criticism in Parliament and in the Press. TheUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union was aware, from conversations which he had already had with Mr. Louw, that the Union Government would be unwilling that Mr. Macmillan should see these people and would try, if theycould, to leave him with the odium of refusing. The High Commissioner felt very strongly that they ought to be seen or, alternatively, that the Union Governmentshould take public responsibility for the decision that Mr. Macmillan should not see them.The Prime Minister had a brief conversation about this with Mr. Louw on27th January. Mr. Louw was unhelpful and evasive. Therefore, on 28th January,the Prime Minister sent him a letter in the following terms:&quot; When we had a word yesterday about the possibility of my seeingsomeone from the Liberal Party and the A.N.C. during my visit, you said youthought that if I wished to pursue this it was something I would need to discuss with Dr. Verwoerd.Since our conversation I have been thinking further about this matterand I thought it would be courteous to let you know that I do feel I oughtto discuss it with the Prime Minister as soon as conveniently possible after wereach Cape Town. It may be that you would like to let him know this.Perhaps it would be helpful if I put my position very briefly like this.There can of course be no question of my receiving from any quarterany petition regarding matters which are the domestic concern of the Union&apos;&apos;     Government: if any such petition were addressed to me (and I understand you have reason to think that the A.N.C. are considering the submission of
something of the kind) I should have it returned at once to the sender, asbeing none of my business. But letting people come and see me is quiteanother matter. Dr. Verwoerd has kindly arranged for me to meet leaders ofthe Parliamentary Opposition Parties, which I very much appreciate. But itis generally known (and was mentioned in questions which I evaded at myPress Conference in Pretoria yesterday) that the Liberal Party and the A.N.C.have both said they would like to meet me. As I understand it, both of the mare legal political associations: and I have had opportunities to meet what might be regarded as their equivalents in all the other African countries Ihave visited on this tour. I feel therefore it would be quite impossible for meto say that I was for my part unwilling to see them though of course I wouldnot see them without Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s agreement.I am Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s guest and I am in his hands. My difficulty is that ifhe should feel it impossible to agree that I should see anyone from thoseParties I fear I should eventually have to indicate when questioned inParliament or by the Press that this was the reason. I would of course do so astactfully as I could, consonantly with making my own position clear: but I ammoved by an awareness of how much credit would accrue to South Africa inthe United Kingdom if it were possible for me to say that I had seen these people with the approval of the Union Government, to suggest that it wouldbe valuable if Dr. Verwoerd and I could discuss the matter before any final decisions are taken &quot;.On 30th January, during an aircraft journey from Durban to Pretoria,Mr. Louw told the High Commissioner that he was most reluctant to forward this letter to Dr. Verwoerd. It would be a great shock to him and would affect thespirit in which Dr. Verwoerd would meet the Prime Minister at Cape Town.Dr. Verwoerd would, he knew, be strongly opposed to the suggestion thatMr. Macmillan should meet the representatives of the African National Congress.It was, in his opinion, a subversive organisation and many of its leaders hadCommunist leanings. It was closely akin to the Congress Parties which had beenbanned in Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland and elsewhere. It position would be greatly strengthened if the Prime Minister saw its representatives. It would bemuch better if the Prime Minister would content himself with seeing representativesof the non-Government Parties in the Union Parliament. This was the line whichthe Union Government had taken in arranging the programme: it was a defensibleline: and Mr. Louw hoped very much that the Prime Minister would fall in with it. In these circumstances he hoped that the Prime Minister would agree towithdraw his letter of 28th January.The gist of this conversation was reported to the Prime Minister in the aircraft.He said that he was unwilling to withdraw his letter, but would be ready to-discussthe matter with Mr. Louw on the following day.The Prime Minister saw Mr. Louw at Libertas, Pretoria, at 10 a.m. on Sunday.31st January. In this discussion Mr. Louw repeated the arguments which he haddeployed to the High Commissioner on the previous evening. He went on to argue that it would be inappropriate for Mr. Macmillan to concern himself, duringthis visit, with the internal politics of the Union. If Mr. Macmillan were visitinga foreign country, he would not think it his duty to see all the political leadersoutside the Government who asked to see him. It would be a reflection on theindependence of the Union if he took a: different line there merely because SouthAfrica was a member of the Commonwealth.The Prime Minister said that he could not accept this argument. Moreover,he was doubtful whether the Union Government would be wise, in their own interest, to appear to be preventing him from hearing the views of their political opponents. This was likely to become a matter of public controversy, certainly inthe United Kingdom; and, if he were questioned about it on his return, it wouldbe difficult for him to avoid implying that, in declining these requests, he had beendeferring to the wishes of the Union Government. For these reasons he thoughtthat this was a matter which he must discuss with Dr. Verwoerd himself; and, that being so, he saw no reason to withdraw his letter of 28th January.After his arrival in Cape Town, Mr. Macmillan had a private talk about this with Dr. Verwoerd. From this it appeared that Dr. Verwoerd felt very strongly that Mr. Macmillan should not meet representatives of the African national congress and that it would be both more logical, and more convenient for the
Union Government, if he confined himself to seeing leaders of the opposition parties represented in the Union Parliament. It was also evident that Dr. Verwoerdwould be much upset if Mr. Macmillan implied, in any public statement, that hewould have liked to see these people but had been prevented from doing so bythe Union Government. Dr. Verwoerd felt very strongly that the distinctionbetween Parties which were represented in the Union Parliament and those whichwere not was a logical distinction on which both he and Mr. Macmillan couldjointly take their stand. He offered to arrange for Mr. Macmillan to see, not onlythe leaders of the United and Progressive Parties, but also Mr. Bloomberg (a CapeColoured Member) and Mrs. Ballinger (the &quot; Native &quot; representative in Parliament).On reflection Mr. Macmillan decided that this matter was less important thanthe content of his Cape Town speech. He intended, in that speech, to make a plainstatement of the policy followed by the United Kingdom Government on race relations in territories for which they were responsible, and to imply that the UnitedKingdom Government could not endorse the racial policy of the UnionGovernment. He thought it more important, from the point of view of publicopinion at home, that he should be uncompromising about this in his speech thanthat he should persist in seeing representatives of the African National Congressagainst the wishes of the Union Government. He thought it inexpedient to riskgiving serious offence to the Union Government on both points, while he was theirguest; and he came to the conclusion that it would he wiser to defer to their wishesin respect of the proposed deputation from the African National Congress. Hedeferred his decision on the precise terms of his reply until he had been able to judge the reception of his speech.On 4th February Mr. Macmillan wrote to the Secretary-General of the AfricanNational Congress in the following terms:&quot;I have read with interest the letter which you addressed to me on25th January. I am obliged to you for giving me a statement of the views ofyour Party, but I regret I am not able to accede to your request that I shouldreceive a deputation.I have received a number of requests from different groups who wishedto put their views to me in person. The arrangements which have been madefor my brief visit to South Africa have not, however, enabled me to receive any deputations from organisations not represented in Parliament.As you will be aware from reports of my speech in Cape Town on 3rd February, I have already expressed my views at length on some of thematters you raise in your letter &quot;.Letters in similar terms were sent to the representatives of other Parties, not represented in the Union Parliament, which had asked him to receive deputations.On 3rd February, Mr. Macmillan had seen the leaders of the United party and the Progressive Party. Records of these two discussions are included in thisprint. He had also taken the opportunity, at the High Commissioner^ gardenparty on 2nd February, to have talks with Mrs. Ballinger who sits in the UnionParliament as the &quot; Native &quot; representative, Mr. Patrick Duncan, the Editor of contact and a well-known Liberal, and the Most Rev. Joost de Blank, archbishop of Cape Town.Finally, on 5th February, he had a brief formal meeting with members of theGovernment-appointed Cape Coloured Board. A record of that meeting is also included in this print.Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; meeting in their private discussion on 4th February, Dr. Verwoerd asked Mr. Macmillanto advise him whether he should raise, on a hypothetical basis, at the May meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers, the question whether South Africa couldremain within the Commonwealth if she became a republic. Mr. Macmillandecided, on reflection, that it would be easier to give advice on this point orallythan to deal with it by telegram after he left the Union. He therefore spoke to dr. Verwoerd about it in a further private conversation which he had with himon the morning of 5th February. In this talk he took the line that, as a matterof procedure, it would be in accordance with precedent that this question shouldbe raised with the other Commonwealth Prime Ministers at a meeting, on a
hypothetical basis, before the constitutional change had been introduced in theUnion. And he put this as a special reason why Dr. Verwoerd should attend theMay meeting.At the end of their talk Dr. Verwoerd said that he would be grateful if hecould have this advice in writing. After the civic luncheon on 5th February,immediately before he left Groote Schuur, Mr. Macmillan handed to Dr. Verwoerda letter marked &quot; private and confidential&quot; in the following terms:&quot; I promised to try to put into writing what I said to you this morningabout the procedural questions relating to the Union&apos;s remaining within theCommonwealth if it becomes a republic.All other countries which have remained within the Commonwealth asrepublics have asked, before taking the formal step of constituting a republic,whether the other members would be content that they should remainthereafter in the Commonwealth. If therefore it is likely that the Union willbecome a republic within, say, the next two years, it would be in accordancewith precedent if the matter were raised at the May meeting on a hypotheticalbasis. I realise that in your case there is in a sense a double hypothesis, firstthat the country will vote for a republic and secondly that having become are public it will desire to remain in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless therewould be advantage in raising the matter in May, when it can be done orallyrather than leaving it to be settled by correspondence at a later date.I venture to repeat that this is an additional reason why I hope that youwill be able to come in person. But in any event this will be an importantmeeting, (a) politically, because it will immediately precede the summit meeting; and (b) constitutionally, because it will decide whether Ghana should remain in the Commonwealth after becoming a republic and whether Nigeriashould be admitted to full Commonwealth membership on attainingindependence.Moreover, as I told you, I would feel it would be a great advantage if at such a meeting you and I and, say, Menzies and Diefenbaker and Nashcould have informal talks together about all these problems. I am sure we will all gain.I shall be glad if you will regard this as a private and confidential letter.It would be a great inconvenience if what I have said were made known inany way, either directly or indirectly.&quot;MAIN POLICY SPEECHAddress by the Right Hon. Harold Macmillan, M.P., to Members of both houses of the Parliament of the Union of South Africa, Cape Town, 3rd February,1960It is a great privilege to be invited to address the Members of both Houses ofParliament in the Union of South Africa. It is a unique privilege to do so in 1960just half a century after the Parliament of the Union came to birth. I am most grateful to you all for giving me this opportunity and I am especially grateful to your Prime Minister who invited me to visit this country and arranged for me to address you here to-day. My tour of Africa-parts of Africa the first ever madeby a British Prime Minister in office, is now alas nearing its end, but it is fittingthat it should culminate in the Union Parliament here in Cape Town, in this historiccity so long Europe&apos;s gateway to the Indian Ocean, and to the East.As in all the other countries that I have visited my stay has been all too short.I wish it had been possible for me to spend a longer time here, to see more of yourbeautiful country and to get to know more of your people, but in the past week Ihave travelled many hundreds of miles and met many people in all walks of life.I have been able to get at least some idea of the great beauty of your countryside,with its farms and its forests, mountains and rivers, and the clear skies and widehorizons of the veldt. I have also seen some of your great and thriving cities, andI am most grateful to your Government for all the trouble they have taken in
making the arrangements which have enabled me to see so much in so short a time.Some of the younger members of my staff have told me that it has been a heavyprogramme, but I can assure you that my wife and I have enjoyed every moment of it. Moreover, we have been deeply moved by the warmth of our welcome.Wherever we have been in town or in country, we have been received in a spirit of friendship and affection which has warrhed our hearts, and we value this the morebecause we know it is an expression of your goodwill, not just to ourselves but toall the people of Britain.It is, as I have said, a special privilege for me to be here in 1960 when you arecelebrating what I might call the golden wedding of the Union. At such a time it is natural and right that yOu should pause to take stock of your position, to lookback at what you have achieved, to look forward to what lies ahead.In the 50 years of their nationhood the people of South Africa have built astrong economy founded upon a healthy agriculture and thriving and resilientindustries. During my visit I have been able to see something of your miningindustry, on which the prosperity of the country is so firmly based. I have seenyour Iron and Steel Corporation and visited your Council of Scientific andIndustrial Research at Pretoria. These two bodies, in their different ways, aresymbols of a lively, forward-looking and expanding economy. I have seen thegreat city of Durban, with its wonderful port, and the skyscrapers of Johannesburg,standing where 70 years ago there was nothing but the open veldt. I have seen,too, the fine cities of Pretoria and Bloemfontein. This afternoon I hope to seesomething of your wine-growing industry, which so far I have only admired as aconsumer.No one could fail to be impressed with the immense material progress whichhas been achieved. That all this has been accomplished in so short a time is a striking testimony to the skill, energy and initiative of your people. We in britain are proud of the contribution we have made to this remarkable achievement. Muchof it has been financed by British capital. According to the recent survey made bythe Union Government, nearly two-thirds of the oversea investment outstandingin the Union at the end of 1956 was British. That is after two staggering warswhich have bled our economy white.But that is not all. We have developed trade between us to our commonadvantage, and our economies are now largely interdependent. You export tous raw materials, food and gold. We in return send you consumer goods or capital equipment. We take a third of all your exports and we supply a third of all yourimports. This broad traditional pattern of investment and trade has been maintained in spite of the changes brought by the development of our twoeconomies, and it gives me great encouragement to reflect that the economies ofboth our countries, while expanding rapidly, have yet remained interdependent and capable of sustaining one another. If you travel round this country by train youwill travel on South African rails made by Iscor. If you prefer to fly you can goin a British Viscount. Here is a true partnership, living proof of theinterdependence between nations. Britain has always been your best customerand, as your new industries develop, we believe that we can be your best partnerstoo.In addition to building this strong economy within your own borders, you have also played your part as an independent nation in the world.As a soldier in the first world war, and as a Minister in Sir Winston Churchill&apos;sGovernment in the second, I know personally the value of the contribution whichyour forces made to victory in the cause of freedom. I know something too, ofthe inspiration which General Smuts brought to us in Britain in our darkest hours.Again in the Korean crisis you played your full part. Thus in the testing&apos;times ofwar or aggression your statesmen and your soldiers have made their influence feltfar beyond the African continent. ,In the period of reconstruction, when Dr. Malan was your Prime Minister,your resources greatly assisted the recovery of the sterling area. In the post-war world now, in the no less difficult tasks of peace, your leaders in industry, commerce and finance continue to be prominent in world affairs to-day. Your readiness toprovide technical assistance to the less * well-developed parts of Africa is of immensehelp to the countries that receive it. It is also a source of strength to your friends in the Commonwealth and elsewhere in the Western world. You are collaboratingin the work of the Commission for Technical Co-operation in Africa South of the
Sahara, and now in the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. YourMinister for External Affairs intends to visit Ghana later this year. All this provesyour determination, as the most advanced industrial country of the continent, toplay your part in the new Africa of to-day.Sir, as I have travelled round the Union I have found everywhere, as Iexpected, a deep preoccupation with what is happening in the rest of the Africancontinent. I understand and sympathise with your interest in these events, and your anxiety about them. Ever since the break up of the Roman Empire one ofthe constant facts of political life in Europe has been the emergence of independentnations. They have come into existence over the centuries in different forms, with different kinds of Government, but all have been inspired by a deep, keen feeling of nationalism which has grown as the nations have grown.In the twentieth century and especially since the end of the war, the processeswhich gave birth to the nation States of Europe have been repeated all over theworld. We have seen the awakening of national consciousness in peoples who have for centuries lived in dependence upon some other Power. Fifteen years ago this movement spread through Asia. Many countries there of different races andcivilisations pressed their claim to an independent national life. To-day the same thing is happening in Africa and the most striking of all the impressions I have formed since I left London a month ago is of the strength of this African nationalconsciousness. In different places it takes different forms but it is happeningeverywhere. The wind of change is blowing through this continent and, whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact. We mustall accept it as a fact, and our national policies must take account of it.Of course you understand this better than anyone. You are sprung from europe, the home of nationalism, and here in Africa you have yourselves created a new nation. Indeed, in the history of our times yours will be recorded as thefirst of the African nationalisms, and this tide of national consciousness which isnow rising in Africa is a fact for which you and we and the other nations of theWestern world are ultimately responsible. For its causes are to be found in the achievements of Western civilisation, in the pushing forward of the frontiers of knowledge, in the applying of science in the service of human needs, in the expanding of food production, in the speeding and multiplying of the means ofcommunication, and perhaps, above all, the spread of education.As I have said, the growth of national consciousness in Africa is a politicalfact and we must accept it as such. That means, I would judge, that we must come to terms with it. I sincerely believe that if we cannot do so we may imperil the precarious balance between the East and West on which the peace of theworld depends. The world to-day is divided into three main groups. First thereare what we call the Western Powers. You in South Africa and we in Britainbelong to this group, together with our friends and Allies in other parts of theCommonwealth. In the United States and in Europe we call it the Free World.Secondly there are the Communists Russia and her Satellites in. Europe and china whose population will rise by the end of the next 10 years to the staggeringtotal of 800 million. Thirdly, there are those parts of the world whose people areat present uncommitted either to Communism or to our Western ideas.In this context we think first of Asia and then of Africa. As I see it the greatissue in this second half of the Twentieth Century is whether the uncommittedpeoples of Asia and Africa will swing to the East or to the West. Will they be drawn into the Communist camp? Or will the great experiments in self-government that are now being made in Asia and Africa, especially within theCommonwealth, prove so successful, and by their example so compelling^ that thebalance will come down in favour of freedom and order and justice?The struggle is joined and it is a struggle for the minds of men. What is howon trial is much more than our military strength or our diplomatic andadministrative skill. It is our way of life. The uncommitted nations want to seebefore they choose., What can we show them to help them choose right? Each of the independent members of the Commonwealth must answer that question for itself. It is a basicprinciple of our modern Commonwealth that we respect each other&apos;s sovereignty in matters of internal policy. At the same time we&quot; must recognise that in thisshrinking world in which we live to-day the internal policies of one nation mayhave effects outside it. . We may sometimes be tempted to say to each other &quot; mind
your own business &quot;, but in these days I would myself expand the old saying sothat it runs: &quot; mind your own business but mind how it affects my business, too &quot;.Let me be very frank with you, my friends. What Governments andParliaments in the United Kingdom have done since the war in accordingindependence to India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Malaya and Ghana, and what they will do for Nigeria and other countries now nearing independence, all this, though we take full and sole responsibility for it, we do in the belief that it is the only way toestablish the future of the Commonwealth and of the Free World on soundfoundations. All this of course is also of deep and close concern to you for nothingwe do in this small world can be done in a corner or remain hidden. What we do to-day in West, Central and East Africa becomes known tomorrow to everyone inthe Union, whatever his language, colour or traditions. Let me assure you, in allfriendliness, that we are well aware of this and that we have acted and will actwith full knowledge of the responsibility we have to all our friends.Nevertheless I am sure you will agree that in our own areas of responsibilitywe must each do what we think right. What we think right derives from a long experience both of failure and success in the management of our own affairs. Wehave tried to learn and apply the lessons of our judgment of right and wrong.Our justice is rooted in the same soil as yours in Christianity and in the rule oflaw as the basis of a free society. This experience of our own explains why it hasbeen our aim in the countries for which we have borne responsibility, not only toraise the material standards of living, but also to create a society which respects the rights of individuals, a society in which men are given the opportunity to growto their full stature and that must in our view include the opportunity to have an increasing share in political power and responsibility, a society in which individualmerit and individual merit alone is the criterion for a man&apos;s advancement, whetherpolitical or economic.Finally in countries inhabited by several different races it has been our aim to find means by which the community can become more of a community, andfellowship can be fostered between its various parts. This problem is by no meansconfined to Africa. Nor is it always a problem of a European minority. In Malaya,for instance, though there are Indian and European minorities, Malays and Chinesemake up the great bulk of the population, and the Chinese are not much fewer in numbers than the Malays. Yet these two peoples must learn to live together inharmony and unity and the strength of Malaya as a nation will depend on thedifferent contributions which the two races can make.The attitude of the United Kingdom towards this problem was clearly expressedby the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, speaking at the United nations general Assembly on the 17th September, 1959. These were his words: &quot;Inthose territories where different races or tribes live side by side the task is toensure that all the people may enjoy security and freedom and the chance tocontribute as individuals to the progress and well being of these countries. We reject the idea of any inherent superiority of one race over another. Our policy thereforeis non-racial. It offers a future in which Africans, Europeans, Asians, the peoples of the Pacific and others with whom we are concerned, will all play their full part as citizens in the countries where they live, and in which feelings of racewill be submerged in loyalty to new nations &quot;.I have thought you would wish me to state plainly and with full candour thepolicy for which we in Britain stand. It may well be that in trying to do our duty as we see it we shall sometimes make difficulties for you. If this provesto be so we shall regret it. But I know that even so you would not ask us to flinchfrom doing our duty.You, too, will do your duty as you see it. I am well aware of the peculiar natureof the problems with which you are faced here in the Union of South Africa. i know the differences between your situation and that of most of the other States in africa. You have here some 3 million people of European origin. This countryis their home. It has been their home for many generations. They have no other.The same is true of Europeans in Central and East Africa. In most other african states those who have come from Europe have come to work, to contribute theirskills, perhaps to teach, but not to make a home.The problems to which you as members of the Union Parliament have to address yourselves are very different from those which face the Parliaments of countries with homogenous populations.   These are complicated and baffling
problems. It would be surprising if your interpretation of your duty did notsometimes produce very different results from ours in terms of Government policies and actions.As a fellow member of the Commonwealth it is our earnest desire to give SouthAfrica our support and encouragement, but I hope you won&apos;t mind my sayingfrankly that there are some aspects of your policies which make it impossible forus to do this without being false to our own deep convictions about the politicaldestinies of free men to which in our own territories we are trying to give effect.I think we ought, as friends, to face together, without seeking to apportion creditor blame, the fact that in the world of to-day this difference of outlook liesbetween us.I said that I was speaking as a friend. I can also claim to be speaking as arelation, for we Scots can claim family connexions with both the great Europeansections of your population, not only with the English-speaking people but withthe Afrikaans-speaking as well. This is a point which hardly needs emphasis inCape Town where you can see every day the statue of that great Scotsman, AndrewMurray. His work in the Dutch Reformed Church in the Cape, and the work of hisson in the Orange Free State, was among Afrikaans-speaking people. There hasalways been a very close connexion between the Church of Scotland and theChurch of the Netherlands. The Synod of Dort plays the same great part in thehistory of both. Many aspirants to the Ministry of Scotland, especially in the17th and 18th Centuries, went to pursue their theological studies in the Netherlands.Scotland can claim to have repaid the debt in South Africa. I am thinkingparticularly of the Scots in the Orange Free State. Not only the younger AndrewMurray, but also the Robertsons, the Frasers, the McDonalds families whichhave been called the Free State clans who become burghers of the old Free Stateand whose descendants still play their part there.But though I count myself a Scot my mother was an American, and the UnitedStates provides a valuable illustration of one of the main points which I have been trying to make in my remarks to-day. Its population, like yours, is of differentstrains and over the years most of those who have gone to North America have gone there in order to escape conditions in Europe which they found intolerable.The Pilgrim Fathers were fleeing from persecution as Puritans and the Marylandersfrom persecution as Roman Catholics. Throughout the 19th Century a stream of immigrants flowed across the Atlantic to escape from poverty in their homelands,and in the 20th Century the United States have provided asylum for the victims of political oppression in Europe.Thus for the majority of its inhabitants America has been a place of refuge,or place to which people went because they wanted to get away from Europe. Itis not surprising, therefore, that for so many years a main objective of Americanstatesmen, supported by the American public, was to isolate themselves from europe, and with tfteir great material strength, and the vast resources open to them,this might have seemed an attractive and practicable course. Nevertheless in thetwo world wars of this century they have found themselves unable to stand aside.Twice their manpower in arms has streamed back across the Atlantic to shed itsblood in those European struggles from which their ancestors thought they wouldescape by emigrating to the New World; and when the second war was over theywere forced to recognise that in the small world of to-day isolationism is out of date and offers no assurance of security.The fact is that in this modern world no country, not even the greatest, canlive for itself alone. Nearly 2,000 years ago, when the whole of the civilised worldwas comprised within the confines of the Roman Empire, St. Paul proclaimedone of the great truths of history-we are all members one of another. Duringthis 20th Century that eternal truth has taken on a new and exciting significance.It has always been impossible for the individual man to live in isolation from hisfellows, in the home, the tribe, the village, or the city. To-day it is impossible fornations to live in isolation from one another. What Dr. John Donne said of individual men 300 years ago is true to-day of my country, your country, and allthe countries of the world :&quot; Any man&apos;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind.And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee &quot;.All nations now are interdependent one upon another and this is generally realisedthroughout the Western world. I hope in due course the countries of Communismwill recognise it too.
It was certainly with that thought in mind that I took the decision to visitMoscow about this time last year. Russia has been isolationist in her time and still has tendencies that way, but the fact remains that we must live in the sameworld with Russia and we must find a way of doing so. I believe that the initiativewhich we took last year has had some success, although grave difficulties may arise.Nevertheless; I think nothing but good can come out of its extending contacts between individuals, contacts in trade and from the exchange of visitors.I certainly do not believe in refusing to trade with people because you mayhappen to dislike the way they manage their internal affairs at home. Boycottswill never get you anywhere, and may I say in parenthesis that I deprecate the attempts that are being made to-day in Britain to organise the consumer boycott of South African goods. It has never been the practice, as far as I know, of any government of the United Kingdom of whatever complexion to undertake orsupport campaigns of this kind designed to influence the internal politics of anotherCommonwealth country, and my colleagues in the United Kingdom deplore this proposed boycott and regard it as undesirable from every point of view. It canonly have serious effects on Commonwealth relations, on trade, and lead to the-ultimate detriment of others than those against whom it is aimed.I said I was speaking of the interdependence of nations. The members ofthe Commonwealth feel particularly strongly the value of interdependence.&apos; Theyare as independent as any nation in this shrinking world can be, but they havevoluntarily agreed to work together. They recognise that there may be and mustbe differences in their institutions; in their internal policies, and their membershipdoes not imply the wish to express a judgment on these matters, or the need toimpose a stifling uniformity. It is, I think, a help that there has never beenquestion of any rigid constitution for the Commonwealth. Perhaps this is because we have got on well enough in the United Kingdom without a written constitution and tend to look suspiciously at them. Whether that is so or not, it is quite clearthat a rigid constitutional framework for the Commonwealth would not work.At the first of the stresses and strains which are inevitable in this period of history,cracks would appear in the framework and the whole structure would crumble.It is the flexibility of our Commonwealth institutions which gives them their strength.Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Honourable Ministers, Ladies &quot;-and Gentlemen, i fear I have kept you a long time. I much welcome the opportunity to speak tothis great audience. In conclusion may I say this. I have spoken frankly aboutthe differences between our two countries in their approach to one of the greatcurrent problems with which each has to deal within its own sphere of responsibility.These differences are well-known. They are matters of public knowledge, indeedof public controversy, and I should have been less than honest if by remainingsilent on them I had seemed to imply that they did not exist. But differences onjone subject, important though it is, need not and should not impair Our capacity to co-operate with one another in furthering the many practical interests which weshare in common.The independent members of the Commonwealth do not always agree on every subject. It is not a condition of their association that they should do so.On the contrary the strength of our Commonwealth lies largely in the fact that itis a free association of independent sovereign States, each responsible for orderingits own affairs but co-operating in the pursuit of common aims and purposes in world affairs. Moreover these differences may be transitory. In time they maybe resolved. Our duty is to see them in perspective against the background ofOur long association. Of this at any rate I am certain those of us who by graceof the electorate are temporarily in charge of affairs in your country and in mine,we fleeting transient phantoms in the great stage of history, we have no right tosweep aside on this account the friendship that exists between our countries, forthat is the legacy of history. It is not ours alone to deal with as we wish. to adapt a famous phrase, it belongs to those who are living, but it also belongs tothose who are dead and to those who are yet unborn. We must face the differences,but let us try to see beyond them down the long vista of the future.I hope-indeed, I am confident-that in another 50 years we shall look backon the differences that exist between us now as matters of historical interest, for as time passes and one generation yields to another, human problems change andfade. Let us remember these truths.&apos;. Let us resolve to build not to destroy, and let us remember always that weakness comes from division, strength from unity.
No. 2 DESPATCH FROM UNITED KINGDOM HIGH commissioner in THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICAMy Lord, Cape Town, 18th February, I960.I have the honour to submit an account of the visit to the Union of the PrimeMinister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan from 27th January to 5th February andof the effect which the visit, and particularly the Prime Minister^ address toParliament, has had on this country. The dust has still to settle, but one canalready say that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s visit is probably the most important event inSouth Africa since the Nationalist Government came to power in 1948. It has hada tremendous impact on all sections of South African public opinion and the net result must have been an unexpected disappointment, not to say shock, to dr. Verwoerd and the National Party. \ . &apos;   ,2. Your Lordship will recall that, on your instructions, I first explained theidea of the Prime Minister^ proposed tour to Dr. Verwoerd on the 9th November.Before this interview I had some doubt about his reactions, though I felt that on balance he would be persuaded by the advantages from his own point of view ofwelcoming the Prime Minister as well as by fear of embarrassment if a visit to commonwealth countries in Africa, including Ghana, Nigeria and the Federation,omitted the Union. In fact, Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s reaction was immediately favourable.He said that he was becoming increasingly aware of the closeness and importanceof ties between the United Kingdom and the Union (characteristically he did notspeak of Commonwealth ties) and that he would very much welcome an opportunityfor personal discussions on matters of common interest, which could better be heldhere than in London where Mr. Macmillan&apos;s time would inevitably be moreprecious. He also responded favourably to the more general idea of the PrimeMinisters tour of Africa, which he seemed to see chiefly as a shrewd move to get in before Mr. Khrushchev. He wondered indeed whether the Prime minister should not consider extending the tour to include some non-commonwealth countries.3. Imwelcoming the visit the principal conditions in Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s mindwere that the Prime Minister should spend at least as long in the Union as elsewhere and that, though he did not mind the Union coming at the end, it shouldbe seen as the culmination of the tour. Though Mr. Macmillan did not feel ableto use this word in the official announcement of his intended visit, Dr. Verwoerdgot what he wanted, though the world-wide impact of the Prime Ministers address to the Union Parliament in Cape Town can hardly have been the kind ofculmination that he had had in mind. . -4. In retrospect it is now fairly clear why Dr. Verwoerd initially welcomed the visit and what he hoped to get out of it. He set the tone in his ownannouncement on the 18th November, in which he said that the fact that the UnionGovernment, &quot; committed to the earliest possible establishment of a republic &quot;,had issued an invitation to Mr. Macmillan, was the best possible proof of SouthAfrica&apos;s desire to maintain and promote friendship and co-operation with Britain,&quot;whatever the constitutional position&quot;. Shortly after becoming Prime Minister,he said, he hkd indicated that a visit by the British Prime Minister would be welcome. It would create an opportunity for personal top level discussions of problems and future developments affecting both countries. The impression which Dr.. Verwoerd sought to convey in this statement was that he, Dr. Verwoerd, hadtaken the initiative, that he was inviting the Prime Minister on his, Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s,terms and that the Prime Minister himself had tacitly accepted these terms. It wasa corollary of this presentation that from the beginning Dr. Verwoerd consistentlyemphasised the importance of the private conversations which he would have withthe Prime Minister and implied that the latter was coming to see him rather thanSouth Africa. This line, faithfully reflected and elaborated in the Nationalist Press,which developed a sudden warmth in speaking of relations between the union and the United Kingdom Government, was no doubt intended to create a climateof opinion, especially among Afrikanders, which would look upon the visit as a diplomatic success for Dr. Verwoerd and even as a deliberate conciliatory gestureon the part of Britain. It was also no doubt intended to convey to English-speakingSouth Africans that relations between the two countries would be unaffected bySouth Africa becoming a republic
5. I think there is little doubt that Dr. Verwoerd succeeded to a considerable extent in conditioning public opinion along these lines. By the time the PrimeMinister arrived in the Union an atmosphere had been created in which themeaning of the visit would almost certainly have been misunderstood to dr. Verwoerd&apos;s advantage, if the Prime Minister had not in his address toParliament made it explicitly clear where he stood. Dr. Verwoerd would havebeen able to claim that Mr. Macmillan had bestowed some kind of tacit blessingupon the Nationalist Government and that, even if he could not approve of all its policies, he was, like Field Marshal Montgomery, in favour of giving it a chance. This would of course have been a major success for Dr. Verwoerd inbreaking out of the circle of isolation and world censure into which he and his party have worked themselves over the past years, and which has of late beenmanifest in increasingly disturbing ways-at the United Nations, in the boycottcampaign and in criticism showered upon the Union not only in the overseasPress but also by the Governments of some nominally friendly countries, such asthe Netherlands.6. Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s intention was to divide the programme for the visit betweenPretoria, the Union&apos;s administrative capital, with excursions to the adjacentsources of industrial and mineral wealth in the Transvaal, and Cape Town, thelegislative capital, where Parliament would be in session and Dr. Verwoerd wouldbe able to get down to his personal top level talks with Mr. Macmillan. The only other fixture on which the Union authorities later set their heart was a visit to aNative Reserve, where the Prime Minister could be shown something of the newpattern of &quot; Bantu authorities&quot;. Although the Union authorities were notunaccommodating, and although they readily recognised that Mr. Macmillanwould feel obliged to pay a brief visit to at least one of the High commission territories, we had a long struggle to secure the inclusion in the programme ofall the Territories and of Natal (to be balanced by a visit to the Free State) which Dr.. Verwoerd evidently considered an unnecessary complication. In the end the programme was as satisfactory as we could reasonably have hoped, giventhe relatively short length of the visit, and though there was some criticism thatMr. Macmillan was not able to spend longer in Natal or to visit its capital,Pietermaritzburg, the itinerary went as far as was practicable to avoid offence to anyone.7. The Prime Minister and his party arrived in Pretoria in the early afternoonon the 27th January, after having stopped for two hours in Francistown in the bechuanaland Protectorate on their way from Salisbury by air. For the first five days Mr. Macmillan was based on Pretoria, staying at Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s officialresidence, &quot; Libertas &quot;, which was placed at his disposal. During this time hevisited mining and industrial developments on the Rand, Bantu housing outsideJohannesburg and a Native Reserve in the Northern Transvaal, where he wasreceived with elaborate and somewhat artificial ceremony, and where he wasalso able to see the Bantu University College under construction at Turfloop.On the Rand Mr. Macmillan&apos;s social engagements included lunch with the Chamberof Mines and a cocktail party given by the Mayor of Johannesburg. In Pretoriahe visited the Voortrekker Monument, the Iron and Steel Corporation (Iscor) andthe Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He also attended a cocktailparty given by the Administrator of the Transvaal. At a private dinner party inmy house he was able to meet and talk to some leading figures in the Transvaal,including Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, an Afrikaans industrialist, and the Editorsof the Star and an influential Afrikaans newspaper. On the 30th January he paid a two-hour visit to Swaziland by air and car via Piet Retief and flew from thereto Durban for an afternoon reception at King&apos;s House, given by the Administratorof Natal. Lady Dorothy&apos;s leg injury prevented her from accompanying the PrimeMinister during the first two days.8. After a day free of official engagements on Sunday, 31st January, thePrime Minister and Lady Dorothy flew to Cape Town on the 1st February, stoppingon the way for brief visits to Bloemfontein, capital of the Free State, and Maseruin Basutoland. At D.F. Malan Airport they were formally welcomed byDr. Verwoerd, who had sent Mr. Louw north to represent him during the first half of the tour. The 3^ days in Cape Town were physically less demanding,there being no travelling beyond a visit to Stellenbosch and Paarl, an hour*s drivefrom Cape Town, and a scenic tour of the Peninsula.   The social engagements
included a State Dinner at Cape Town Castle, a lunch with the Mayor of CapeTown, tea with the Administrator of the Cape Province and a Garden Party at high Commission House. The highlight was of course the Prime Ministersaddress to the Members of both Houses in the dining room of the Parliamentbuilding. This relatively uncrowded public programme allowed two morningsand an evening for talks with Dr. Verwoerd, a dinner with the Union Cabinet atGroote Schuur (Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s residence at which the Prime Minister and lady Dorothy were his guests) and a private dinner with Dr. Verwoerd. Thelatter made available his own room in the Assembly building for the Prime Ministerto talk to the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, and leaders of the progressive Party, Dr. Steytler and Mr. Harry Lawrence. Lady Dorothy paid a visit on her own to the Malay Quarter in Cape Town. The Prime Minister, whohad received the Press on his first arrival in Pretoria, gave a Press conference onthe morning of his departure on the 5th February.9. All these engagements, including the numerous shorter speeches whichthe Prime Minister made during his tour, received the fullest publicity from bothsections of the Press, who commented with warmth and admiration on his stamina,good humour and diplomatic skill. The security arrangements were elaborate, thepolice being very much in evidence throughout the tour. The Union authoritiesalso, with some exceptions, withheld from the public advance information about Mr. Macmillan&apos;s precise movements, mainly with the intention of frustrating a campaign announced by the African National Congress to picket the route withslogan-bearing supporters and impress upon the visitors that they were not meeting&quot; the people &quot; and that the Africans had &quot; never had it so bad &quot;. These security precautions inevitably limited opportunities for public demonstrations of feeling.But where occasion offered, as in Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town, not to mention the High Commission Territories, there was an impressive turnout andscenes of great enthusiasm not only from white South Africans but, when mr. Macmillan visited the townships near Johannesburg, from thronging Africansas well. The climax was reached when the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothymade their farewell drive to the docks to board the Cape Town Castle. Most ofthis popular enthusiasm no doubt came from the English-speaking part of thepopulation; a part, at least, of the acclamation in Cape Town was contributed by united Kingdom citizens temporarily or permanently in the Cape; and therewas probably an element of old-fashioned jingoism in some of the clamour. Butthere is no doubt that Mr. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy also earned the respect and in some cases the affection of Afrikanders as well. The Prime Ministersnumerous short addresses throughout the country, of which the main themes werethe pace of change, the interdependence of nations and the importance of theCommonwealth, were felicitously attuned to his different audiences and invariablymade a notable impact.10. I mentioned earlier the regrets in Natal that Mr. Macmillan did notspend longer in the Province. The other chief criticism of his programme wasthat it did not permit him to meet political leaders from outside Parliament, thatis to say, of the non-Europeans and Liberal Party. The Liberals received someconsolation from private talks with Mr. Macmillan during my Garden Party.But although pressed by the Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd was adamant in resisting his suggestion that he should meet leaders of the African national congress, though arrangements were made for him to call upon the totallyunrepresentative Coloured Advisory Council in Cape Town, at which the PrimeMinister made it clear in a short address that he was speaking through them tothe coloured community as a whole. The omission from the programme of any opportunity to hear the views of African leaders other than the officially approvedchiefs at the tribal gathering in the Northern Transvaal was a subject of adversecomment in United Kingdom newspapers as well as in liberal circles in the Union.But most of this criticism fell away after the Prime Minister^ address to Parliament.11. I shall not try to recapitulate in this despatch the record ofMr. Macmillan&apos;s talks with Dr. Verwoerd. I should observe, however, that theattitude of Dr. Verwoerd and Mr. Louw and the subjects they raised were fullyconsistent with the analysis, with which this despatch began, of Dr. Verwoerd&apos;attitude to the visit. Apart from the perennial chestnuts (like Mr. Louw&apos;s desireto deal direct with the Foreign Secretary and to be excluded from no discussions on Africa) and ad hoc topics (like the Union&apos;s candidature for the Security Council),
Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s chief pre-occupations were, first, to secure United Kingdom support for the Union&apos;s ambitions to play a fuller part in Africa; secondly, to draw out thePrime Minister on the subject of the republic; and thirdly to press for prior consulation about political and economic developments in the High commission territories, and for an opportunity to explain Union policy to their inhabitants.His remarks on the first topic were staggering in their lack of realism. The Union,he said, was the one solid foundation in Africa on which the West could build.But its influence with other African States was being seriously impaired by lack of support from the United Kingdom and the United States. If they would onlyshow greater confidence in what the Union Government were doing to further the Western cause throughout Africa and if only the &quot; prejudices &quot; against theUnion among new African States could be overcome, the Union Governmentcould help these States and bind them more closely to the Western cause. It would therefore be helpful if the United Kingdom could now show more sympatheticunderstanding of the motives and intentions of the Union Government in Africa.This line is of course not new, but it is remarkable that South African ministers should have thought that they could seriously present it to the Prime Minister ata time when both official and public opinion in London and in the world point soclearly in the opposite direction. The Prime Minister was obliged to warnDr. Verwoerd at the same meeting that, far from supporting the Union in a campaign to extend its influence in Africa, we might have regretfully to stand aside when the apartheid issue next came before the United Nations. this conversation took place the day before the Prime Minister addressed parliament and illustrates strikingly both the Union Governments lack of comprehensionand the shock which Mr. Macmillan&apos;s frank statement of British policy must have caused Dr. Verwoerd and his colleagues.12. Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s purpose in raising the question of the republic was, asexpected, to obtain assurances from Mr. Macmillan without, however, bindinghis own hands. Dr. Verwoerd gave no indication of his intentions about timingbeyond enquiring whether it would be opportune to bring up the matter informallyand hypothetically at the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference in May to test the opinionof other members about a South African Republic remaining in the Commonwealth.He also asked Mr. Macmillan directly whether the British Government wishedSouth Africa to stay in. Throughout this conversation Dr. Verwoerd was careful to express no explicit wish himself to preserve the Commonwealth connexion.13. When the Prime Minister addressed the combined Houses of parliament on the 3rd February, South Africa and the world outside probably still believedthat the visit would pass off without controversy; and Dr. Verwoerd, though toldbeforehand of the lines on which Mr. Macmillan intended to speak, may still havecherished the illusion (which was so startlingly apparent in the private talks ofthe previous day) that he could manipulate the British Government into playinghis game. Mr. Macmillan began his address with the themes that he had emphasised in earlier speeches: the &quot; wind of change &quot; throughout Africa, the force of Africannationalism, the need to come to terms with it as a political fact, and the smallnessof the world. After showing recognition of the Union&apos;s special problems deriving from its large European population with no other home but South Africa, he stated frankly and as a friend the United Kingdom&apos;s policy in the areas of Africafor which the British Government bore responsibility. In a world divided betweenthe Western Powers, the Communist countries and the uncommitted nations, itwas Britain&apos;s task not only to raise living standards but to create societies wheremen could grow to their full stature. This must include the opportunity to enjoyan increasing share of political power and responsibility. Individual merit aloneshould be the criterion of a man&apos;s political or economic advancement. Thoughit was the United Kingdom&apos;s earnest desire to give South Africa support and encouragement as a fellow member of the Commonwealth, there were someaspects of her policy which made it impossible for the United Kingdom to do this without being false to its own convictions. After giving the Union Governmentits only crumb of comfort by forthrightly condemning the boycott campaign,Mr. Macmillan concluded on the theme of the importance and fundamentalstrength of the Commonwealth which lay in flexible co-operation betweenindependent countries pursuing common ends and purposes without obligationto agree on every subject. Present differences might be transitory; the friendshipbetween the Union and the United Kingdom was the legacy of history and belonged to those yet unborn.
14. Mr. Macmillan was heard in almost complete silence, but there waswarm applause at the end, though some of the Nationalist ranks forbore to join in it. When Dr. Verwoerd rose to reply the atmosphere was tense and someobservers from the Press gallery reported that he was white with emotion.However, that may be, the task he chose to impose on himself was unenviable.Apart from the unpalatability of the contents of Mr. Macmillan&apos;s speech he wasfaced with a direct personal challenge. He could have contented himself witha brief speech of acknowledgement, which some people thought would have beenthe wisest course. But he no doubt felt that he could not leave his supporterswithout a final word from himself and it would have been out of character for him to ignore a challenge to his debating skill. Considering the difficulties ofreplying ex tempore in such circumstances, his performance, though it soundeda little lame and harsh, was not uncreditable and seemed to delight his supporters.After a shaky start and a laboured joke, he made it clear that he did not shareMr. Macmillan&apos;s view of Africa. He feared that British policy might well lead todisaster. There must be justice for the White man as well as for the Black. Butthough there was this difference between Britain and South Africa, who believedin &quot; separate development &quot;, the Union was with the West in resisting Communismand he hoped that good political and economic relations would continue with theUnited Kingdom.   He did not mention the Commonwealth.15. Apart from Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s reply the only official comment so far on thePrime Ministers speech has been an interview with Mr. Louw published byDie Burger on 8th February, in which he expressed his surprise that Mr. Macmillanshould have seen fit to criticise South Africa&apos;s internal affairs and wondered whether he would have behaved in this manner had the Union not been a commonwealth country. In the same vein he also attacked those who had criticisedthe omission from the Prime Minister^ programme of any opportunity to meetrepresentatives of the African National Congress and asked how the BritishGovernment would have reacted if the Prime Minister of South Africa, invitedas an official guest, had asked to see Sir Oswald Mosley. Finally, he expressedthe hope that Mr. Macmillan was not thinking of changing his views about the validity of Article 2 (7) of the United Nations Charter and expressed surprise thatat his official Press conference he had avoided committing himself to continuedsupport of South Africa on the apartheid item. On the 16th FebruaryDr. Verwoerd was asked in a Parliamentary Question whether Mr. Louw had consulted him before making this statement and whether his views represented the position of the Union Government. Dr. Verwoerd evaded the question. Butthere is no doubt that the Union Cabinet as a whole bitterly resent the PrimeMinister&apos;s plain speaking.16. The immediate reaction to Mr. Macmillan&apos;s speech in both the English-speaking and Afrikaans Press was to recognise it as a major event for the union and for Africa. Opposition newspapers, who are now representative more of the progressive than of the United Party, welcomed its blunt realism wholeheartedlyand proceeded to rub in its lesson that the Union, as a result of 12 years of nationalist rule, now stood totally isolated. The United Party have not so farreacted officially to the speech, though unofficially they have warmly welcomedit as a blow to the Nationalists, while ignoring the implications for themselves.17. The Afrikaans Press has been a particularly interesting object of study.For the first two days after the speech their reaction was unexpectedly mild. since then, however, Die Burger, organ of the Cape Nationalists, in a daily sequence of articles, has adopted an increasingly sharp tone and apparently sought to create an atmosphere of crisis and of a parting of the ways. In an article headed &quot; Stateof Emergency &quot; it concluded that Britain had now placed herself firmly on the sideof African nationalism and African self-government and that she was callouslyready to sacrifice White interests in Africa for this policy. A later article objected to Mr. Macmillan&apos;s high moral tone in explaining what was in fact an opportunistdecision motivated by cold war considerations. Another article, &quot; The End of anIllusion &quot;, saw the speech as a warning to British communities in South africa and elsewhere that, though they had been originally encouraged by jDast british governments to settle in Africa in support of Britain&apos;s Imperial Mission, theycould now no longer expect British support or protection. Die Burger&apos;s conclusion was that South Africans must now be ready to stand alone and cling togethertrusting to their own resources. Their differences of approach to the racial problemmust take second place.
18. Other Afrikaans newspapers, including Die Transvaler, the Nationalistorgan for the Transvaal and the Free State, with which Dr. Verwoerd is closely associated, have been notably more restrained than Die Burger. Indeed, their linehas not perceptibly sharpened since their initial relatively.conciliatory comments.In particular they have avoided giving any impression that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s speechhas faced the Union with a crisis. This is consistent with current belief that dr. Verwoerd instructed the Transvaler (he is not in a position to instruct DieBurger) to remain as far as possible restrained and non-committal. It would seemprobable that he wishes to have further time to gauge public opinion and to decide on the best tactics. Meanwhile Die Burger&apos;s ballons d&apos;essai may help him to decide whether a call of &quot; backs to the wall &quot; would succeed in creating a sense of commondanger and common interest which could serve Nationalist ends and in particularhelp to secure a republican majority in the referendum.19. It is still too early to judge either the effect of the speech on the general public or its likely consequences in terms of political tactics. I am told thatAfrikanders on the platteland had expected something even stronger and saw nothingfrightening or objectionable in the speech. At the opposite end some of the Englishcommunity, who welcomed it as a personal triumph for a British Prime Minister,may be less enthusiastic when its meaning sinks in. But there is no doubt that public opinion, at any rate its thoughtful component, has been given a severe joltand that intelligent South Africans of all political shades have been obliged tore-think their position; and some are already feeling the better for it. It is,however, too much to hope that this re-thinking, in the sense of a revaluation of policies and principles, extends to the Nationalist Party caucus. The evidencesuggests that, though there is much cerebration, it is concentrated on internal political tactics. While he bides his time Dr. Verwoerd is doubtless pondering on how best to turn the present situation to his advantage and repair his prestige, nowprobably lower in the eyes of his Nationalist supporters than at any time since hebecame Prime Minister. His supporters in their turn are wondering how to cornerthe United Party and how best to harness the impact of the speech to the causeof republicanism.20. Already Mr. Japie Basson, the ex-Nationalist Member for Namib inSouth-West Africa, had announced plans for forming a moderate Afrikaner party which might work in harness with the United Party. Its prospects are doubtful,but his decision to canvass it at the present time must reflect the hope that adefection of Nationalists from Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s leadership is now a seriouspossibility. Any such defections among the caucus would almost certainly springfrom individual opportunism and personal resentment of Dr. Verwoerd ratherthan from a genuine clash of principle; indeed there have been rumours for many months that some of the Cape Nationalists under Dr. Donges are awaiting theiropportunity for a showdown.21. I have mentioned these confusing cross-currents only to illustrate thegreater fluidity into which South African politics seem to have been thrown.This is the result not only of the impact of the Prime Ministers speech but also,among other things, of a gradual growth of scepticism during the past year aboutthe practicability and tactical wisdom of the Bantustan plan with which Dr.. Verwoerd had at first dazzled his supporters. But I must make it clear thatin my opinion these intriguing possibilities derive in the main from tacticalconsiderations. There is no sign that the Government intend to modify theirpresent policies. Indeed it is more likely that they will intensify them. TheTransvaler has significantly called for an acceleration of the pace of &quot; separatedevelopment &quot;. We must also be prepared for the possibility that our relationswith the Union Government may become still less easy and even that the anti-Commonwealth faction in the Nationalist Party may grow. Dr. Verwoerd maybe trying to gauge whether he could now obtain a majority for a republic outsidethe Commonwealth of which Mr. Louw, among others, is rumoured to be anadvocate and to which his interview with Die Burger may have been intended topoint. If Dr. Verwoerd concludes that a republic outside the commonwealth would not command majority support he has been careful to mask his ownpreferences he may now find himself in the difficulty that his own Party are lesswilling to back him in seeking a republic inside the Commonwealth. In other words, the Prime Ministers speech may have upset the delicate balance of feelingwithin the Nationalist caucus on which Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s recent decision to announce
the referendum was presumably based. It is not impossible, therefore, that the speech may have the paradoxical effect of forcing Dr. Verwoerd to postpone final decisions about the timing and status of the republic.22. To sum up, Mr. Macmillan&apos;s visit has set South Africa in a ferment.There is no politically articulate section of the community which is not now engaged in some form of debate or reappraisal. The long-term results cannot beforecast, though they may indeed prove far-reaching. In the short term and apart from its effect in the wider international context the Prime Minister^ visithas achieved the following important results:(i) it has brought new and welcome realism into our relationship with theUnion;(ii) it has enormously encouraged the leaven of progressive and liberal opinion in the Union which seems at present to offer the main hope of progress towards a saner approach to race relations here;(iii) it has done much to re-establish the faith of the African and colouredpopulation of the Union in Britain and the Commonwealth;(iv) it has, by putting our current differences of outlook into a historicalcontext, most skilfully established the distinction between the presentNationalist Government and South Africa as a whole. This in itself is a real achievement, since it is South Africa&apos;s potential rather thanher present which justifies the patience and perseverance devoted bythe United Kingdom Government to our relations with the Union:but until the Prime Ministers speech no way had been found of making this distinction in a public statement.23.
