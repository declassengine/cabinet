ANNEXHOUSING policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh affairs. IntroductionI believe the stage has been reached where housing policy in England andWales needs to be given a change of direction, and for that reason I must ask theCabinet to take a comprehensive look at the matter. There are three main aspects.2. The first is subsidy. I think the time is ripe for a radical reshaping of subsidy arrangements, with the basic objects of directing subsidy where it is most needed, and of making payment of future subsidies conditional on the localauthority pursuing an adequate rent policy and showing financial need. This wouldinvolve legislation. If the principles set out in section III of this paper meet with approval, I would like to bring forward a Bill next Session.3. The second aspect is building to let. Since the war, practically all building to let has been done by public authorities; private enterprise has concentrated on building for sale. This situation will drag on unless we can encourage privateenterprise to come back into building to let or can bring in other non-municipalagencies, such as housing associations or trusts, to help fill the gap. Though theproblem is difficult, particularly in the matter of finance, I am sure that we musttackle it, and we could make a start in the Bill I have in mind.4. The third need is to secure better management of privately-owned rentedhouses. I want to encourage private owners to make more use of improvement and conversion grants. Ultimately we may have to force the pace by requiringmodern conveniences to have been installed by a given date; but first we should see if we cannot get better results without resorting to compulsion of this kind.5. I am circulating this paper to give the Cabinet a general view of thehousing situation; to obtain their views on whether there should be a housing bill next Session; and to indicate what its form might be.II. Review of Present Position(i) House-building6. New house-building, private and public, is running at the rate of about275,000 completions a year in England and Wales (300,000 in the whole of GreatBritain). Of this 275,000, about 165,000 (60 per cent.) are likely to be completedthis year by private enterprise, and 110,000 (40 per cent.) by public authorities,including new town corporations. This level of output is about equal to thenumber of completions in 1957; in other words, house-building as a whole hasnow just about recovered the ground lost as a result of the counter-inflationary measures taken in the autumn of that year. This recovery is, however, largely dueto the continued growth of private building; building by public authorities is stillabout 10 per cent, below the programme they were working to in 1957, and below what they would like to do.7. Virtually all private building is for owner-occupation; only a tiny fraction(chiefly expensive fiats) is for letting. It is unevenly distributed over the country,being mainly concentrated in the south and east. In the north it tends to be verythinly spread.8. Since 1956, when the subsidy for general needs housing was reduced (it wasabolished in the following year except for one-bedroom dwellings), house-building in the public sector has been concentrated on those special purposes for whichsubsidies have continued to be available. These are slum clearance rehousing,old people&apos;s accommodation, building to house overspill and building to houseincoming industrial workers.
9. Slum clearance has been the main effort of the local authorities. Overthe past four years about 200,000 houses have been demolished or closed, and the families living in them rehoused. Clearance is now going ahead at the rate ofabout 60,000 houses a year (well over half of all local authority building is for slum clearance). But though good progress has been made, a very great deal remains to be done. At least a further 650,000 houses unfit for human habitation have still to be dealt with in England and Wales; and as time goes by and property getsolder, the actual number may well prove to be much larger. Though about halfthe local authorities should complete their present clearance programmes by theend of 1962, the larger and more difficult part of the task will still be to come. Themain concentrations of slums are in the older industrial towns of the midlands andthe north. In places such as Liverpool, Manchester, Oldham and Batley theproportion of slums is as high as 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, of all dwellings, whileelsewhere a ratio of 20 per cent, is not uncommon. Though at the present rateof clearance the great majority of the 3,500 housing authorities should finish the job within the next 10 years, the 50 or so with the very big and difficult problemswill need much longer. Some indeed will have to have a higher rate of financialassistance if they are to find their way through within the next 20 to 30 years.10. Next to slum clearance, local authorities have concentrated on theprovision of onerbedroom dwellings (fiats, flatlets and bungalows) suitable forthe elderly, childless couples and single people. They have now raised theirbuilding of these smaller units to about 25,000 a year. In an ageing population,in which there will also be an increasing number of separate households, we mustplan to meet a large and growing demand for this kind of accommodation. a considerably increased proportion of the total house-building programme oughtto be devoted to this purpose; and it will tend to release larger houses nowunder-occupied. Many&apos; of the old cannot, however, afford the economic rent of even the smallest dwelling, and that means subsidy.11. Overspill building (in London new towns and in town development schemes) at present amounts to upwards of 10,000 houses a year. This is inadequate, because sheer shortage of house-room is now most acute in the bigcities which are almost at an end of building land within their own boundaries andtherefore are largely dependent on overspill building for relief. As building inthe new towns is now running down, the position will worsen unless faster progress can be made with the expansion of small towns to take population (andemployment) out from the big cities. It may also be necessary to start one or two more new towns, though not for London. Had we had a new town under construction for Liverpool, we could probably have got one of the new car factories to go there, with advantage to everyone.12. Of the 110,000 houses likely to be completed in the public sector during1960, some 95,000 (perhaps more) will be absorbed by building for the threesubsidised purposes just described (slum clearance 60,000, one-bedroom dwellings25,000, overspill building 10,000). The remaining 15,000 (perhaps Jess) will be mainly for &quot; general needs &quot;, a phrase which, at any rate in the big cities, meansfamilies in need of better accommodation because of gross overcrowding or urgenthealth reasons. This amount of &quot; general needs &quot; building tp let is very small inrelation to what is required if people are to get out of thoroughly unsatisfactoryconditions relatively quickly. In recent housing debates our own back-bencherswith knowledge of these cities have been calling on the Government for freshinitiatives to tackle overcrowding.13. A number of local authorities would be building more, for general needs,even without subsidy if they were allowed to. If I did not hold them back, thetotal public programme would probably be of the order of 120,000 houses a year,or 10,000 more than the current rate. This was the size of programme authorities were building to when the 1957 cut was made; this is the size of public programmewe ought to aim at getting back to for the next two or three years, although after that it could be reduced as one authority after another completes its slum clearance.(ii) Improvements and Conversions14. Changes made last year in the grant system for the improvement andconversion of older houses have led to a marked increase in the amount of grant-aided improvement work. The rate is now above 100,000 a year (compared with
35,000 a year before the 1959 Act), and the trend is still upward. The great bulkof the applications for grant have however come from owner-occupiers; the response from landlords has so far been disappointingly small.15. It is impossible to forecast whether the present upward trend willcontinue, or whether indeed the current rate of 100,000 will be maintained. Somuch depends upon the owners, with whom the initiative rests. Though the rateof progress to date has been encouraging, it is still small in relation to need. Thereare at least 2\ to 3 million sound houses in need of improvement (in the main bythe provision of bathroom, indoor water closet, hot-water system and a properfood store). To make a sufficiently speedy impact on the problem, the rate ofimprovement ought to be raised to 200,000 or 250,000 a year. Even then, it wouldtake 10 to 15 years to modernise all the houses worth modernising. If they arenot modernised (and so given a new lease of life) within the next 10 years or so,large numbers of them will run down into slums, it is important therefore toencourage owners, particularly landlords, to make wider use of improvement grants by removing deterrents and strengthening inducements wherever possible.16. There are however many small landlords who may well be unable or unwilling to improve their properties, even with the aid of grant. We cannot therefore rely on the grant system alone to get improvements done to rented houseson an adequate scale. Methods of dealing with this problem are discussed in sections III and IV below.(tii) Haw we stand17. Since 1945 just over 3 million new dwellings haye been provided inEngland and Wales (nearly 3^ millions in Great Britain). This is nearly equivalentto rehousing one family out of every four in the country.18. As a result of this immense output, there is no longer a nation-wideshortage of housing accommodation. In many rural areas and small towns thereis now no great problem; over a large part of the country the truly urgent needshave been met, or very nearly so. But elsewhere many families are still living inmost unsatisfactory conditions with little hope of escape. There is badovercrowding, mainly in the big cities, but to some extent also in the older industrialtowns of the midlands and north, and indeed in some new and expanding industrial areas. It is in these places that the housing effort needs to be increased, if we are really to throw off the reproach of the &quot; Two Nations &quot;.19. In the big towns, a main cause of this unsatisfied demand is the shortageof land for building. Planning policies have rightly set a limit on outward growth;they insist on the preservation of a green belt around the built-up area, and thedecentralisation of population and employment to smaller places some distanceaway.20. Since 1951, no new towns have been started in England and Wales (as distinct from Scotland) for the relief of overcrowded and congested towns. Further&quot; overspill &quot; building has relied on local authority action, largely in the form of town development schemes based on agreement between the exporting and receivingauthorities. For a number of reasons (planning, financial, administrative andpolitical) progress has been very slow. The London County Council have made realefforts to get schemes going; they have succeeded in several places which are alreadyproducing homes and employment for Londoners, and they now have a good prospect of getting agreement on two or three major schemes in Hampshire.Elsewhere, with one or two exceptions, not much has yet been achieved; but localauthorities in the counties have received one or two sharp shocks recently, in the shape of threats by the exporting authorities to break out for themselves(Birmingham&apos;s demand for 2,500 acres at Wythall, for instance), and I believe weshall be getting better progress now in some of the difficult areas. Manchester seems likely to reach agreement on building what will virtually be a new town atWesthoughton in Lancashire. I am trying to achieve agreement betweenBirmingham and the surrounding counties on two or three substantial schemes of town development. I intend to see Liverpool in an effort tp make them accept thepolicy of decentralisation, in which Lancashire has always been prepared toco-operate. If I can slightly improve the rate of Government assistance foroverspill, and be prepared, where there is a strong, case, tp start anotherGovernment new town, it would provide a fresh stimulqs at a critical moment. We
might, within the next year, be able to find agreed and acceptable solutions for allthe main overspill problems, which have caused so much trouble and heartburningsince the war.21. Overspill is however only one aspect of unsatisfied housing demand.More house-building is required in the difficult areas to meet all kinds of need. slum clearance (with its heavy incidence in the older industrial towns) and housing for old people have already been mentioned. In addition, in a number of cities and large towns there are a great many families on the waiting lists still without a separatehome of their own. Some double up with other members of the family, a potentcause of friction, especially when newly marrieds have to live with in-laws. others have rooms in multi-occupied houses, a family on each floor with inadequatesanitary arrangements, and are often living under conditions worse than if they hada slum house to themselves. Then there are people who urgently need rehousingon health grounds, or because of some other disability. These are types of &quot; generalhousing &quot; need which cannot be met by private building (because the families cannot afford to buy), yet for which little is being done as yet by the local authorities becauseof the priority which existing subsidy arrangements give to slum clearance and otherspecified purposes. I want now a greater flexibility in the subsidy pattern so thatauthorities can build more freely according to their judgment of the urgency of theneed to be met.(iv) Subsidies22. Existing arrangements provide for the payment of fixed annual amounts of Exchequer subsidy for certain specified purposes. These subsidies are payableat the same flat rate for 60 years to all housing authorities regardless of their localpoverty or wealth.23. The specified purposes and basic amounts of subsidy for the ordinarytype of council dwelling are:One-bedroom dwellingfor general needs   ...       10 per annum (3s. lOd. per week)Slum clearancerehousing    ......       22 Is. Od. per annum   (8s.   5d. per week)Overspill andindustrial housing ...       24 per annum (9s.   2d. per week)A further  8 per annum is added for overspill in the new towns; and, usually,in town development schemes (contributed in whole or in part by the exportingauthorities) but in these cases it is provided only for the initial 10 years on the theory that, in time, the receiving authority should be able to manage with onlythe standard subsidy.There is a discretionary power to enable these basic amounts (apart fromoverspill and industrial housing) to be increased up to a maximum of  30 adwelling, if a local authority can show that unless given extra assistance theywould have to charge unreasonably high rents or incur an unduly heavy rate burden. Few authorities have so far qualified for this additional help, thoughthe number is increasing.The key figure of  22 Is. Od. was fixed when the cost of building was lowerand when the rate of interest was 3J per cent. To-day it is 51 per cent.24. Higher rates of subsidy for the same purposes are payable on a graduatedscale where building takes the form of flats in high blocks (because these are more expensive to build); and there is also a special subsidy, again on a graduated scale,for expensive sites costing more than  4,000 an acre when developed.25. In isolation, existing subsidies are inadequate to bridge the gap between, the weekly cost of a new house and the amount of rent that many families in thelower income group can reasonably be expected to pay. The present average cost of a typical three-bedroom council house is about  1,800 (including land), andthe economic rent at the current interest rate for local authorities works out at about 50s. a week net. To this has to be added 10s. to 15s: for rates, and so theinclusive weekly cost, assuming no subsidy, would amount to between  3 and 3 5s. Od. a week. Subsidy at the slum clearance rate (for which the majorityof council houses now being built qualify) would reduce this by 8s. 5d. a week,
making it  2 11s. 6d. to  2 16s. 6d. a week. Where the family income is below 14 a week, this is too high. (On the basis of figures derived from the FamilyExpenditure Survey in 1958, it is estimated that there are something over 6 millionfamilies in this income group.) Many could not afford to pay more than  2 to 2 10s. Od. a week inclusive (30s. to 35s. net rent), and others not as much.26. However, the existing subsidies which are being paid out on currentnew building do not have to be looked at in isolation. Local authorities are alsoreceiving a very large amount of subsidy on the 3 million houses they have previously built. These include about 1$ million houses built at cheap cost before1939 which to-day, as a result of inflation, no longer need to be subsidised, though they will still attract subsidy till 60 years are up. The total subsidy bill on all existing local authority houses now amounts to about  59 millions per annum,of which  11 millions is in respect of pre-1939 houses. At the current rate ofbuilding in the public sector, the bill is increasing annually at the rate of 3 millions- 4 millions.27. Local authorities as a whole have therefore large subsidy resources attheir disposal to enable them to keep rents down for their poorer tenants, andalso to carry on for a time with new building, despite the inadequacy of existingsubsidies looked at in isolation. The great weakness of the present position isthat the  59 millions a year subsidy now being paid out is distributed very unevenlybetween authorities (because of wide differences in the numbers of cheap pre-warhouses they own, and of variations in the amount of subsidy paid during thepost-war period) and that the amount each authority is already entitled to, or mayget for new building under present arrangements, bears scant relationship eitherto its financial or to its housing need.(v) Municipal Rents28. Local authorities have in fact managed to carry on house-building since1956 by pooling rents and, to a lesser extent, subsidies. This means that they havespread the cost of new building over all their houses, by gradually pushing up andevening out (as between their cheaper and more expensive houses) the level of rents charged. In addition some authorities, through the operation of differentialrent schemes, have used the subsidies they receive as a pool out of which to abatethe rents of their poorer tenants. Though the level of council rents in many areas is still low, the general level has been going up steadily over the past three years,roughly at the rate of 1\ per cent, per annum.29. But the ability of authorities to finance further house-building in thisway varies widely, because of differences in resources. Many of the big townsand cities still have a good deal of rent potential to draw on: they have largenumbers of cheap pre-war houses, and their rents generally are still very low. Onthe other hand, many of the rural districts and smaller towns have in their pool of accommodation a high proportion of post-war and therefore expensive houses,and these authorities have already pushed up their rents a long way, in some cases to about as far as they can go in relation to current wage levels. For these authorities, mostly in country districts, additional house-building would meanimposing an increasing burden on the rates.30. Furthermore, many of the bigger authorities which are Socialist-controlledpursue a low rent policy deliberately. They are unwilling to adopt differentialrent or rent rebate schemes which take account of rent-paying capacity. Theysupplement the Exchequer subsidies by contributions from the rates (which theyare no longer under any statutory obligation to make) in order to keep rents lowall round. Yet many of their tenants could certainly afford to pay much higherrents, and in some cases the full economic unsubsidised rent.31. In consequence, council house rents are often lower in terms of shillingsper week in the towns than in the rural districts.. In some of the big cities, theyare absurdly low. The average rent (exclusive of rates) of a post-war three-bedroom house is about 16s. in Manchester, 16s. 3d. in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,18s. 3d. in Liverpool, and 18s. 7d. in Hull. On the other hand, many ruralcouncils are charging average net rents of between 25s. and 30s. a week for thesame kind of accommodation, in spite of the relatively low level of earnings in rural areas.
32. Expressed in terms of aross value (G.V.) (the &quot; gross value &quot; of a houseor flat broadly represents the rent, estimated at 1939 values, which it Would havefetched in its 1956 condition), the contrast in average council rents between the big towns and the rural districts is even more marked. For rural districts, theaverage rent at March 1959 worked but at slightly above 2 G.V., and is the highestfor all classes of local authorities; for county boroughs the average comes out at - 6 G.V., and is the lowest. These figures compare significantly with the rentlimit of 2 G.V. for privately-rented houses subject to control under the Rent Act.III. What Needs to be Done33. The lessons to be drawn from this review are that to-day there is nolonger a national housing problem, but a collection of local problems: these problems are serious in some parts of the country only: to play their part in meeting them, local authorities will still need to continue building a substantial number of houses: even where the problems are serious, there are big variations in the size and character of the needs to. be met: there are also wide differences inthe resources available to local authorities to meet them: some authorities are getting more help than they need: others are not getting enough. Policy shouldbe reshaped so as to take account of these differences, with the aim of enablinghousing effort to be applied from now on where it is most needed and on asufficient scale.  How can this be done?34.   As the first step, I put forward the following broad proposals :(a) We should pay subsidies for new building only where there is financialneed, and in those cases we should make it more adequate to the need.This would mean withdrawing the present flat-rate system of subsidies and replacing it, for houses built to meet local demand, bya graduated system based on a test of the CounciFs financial need.This test would take cognisance both of rent income, and of any surplus in the housing account arising from subsidies on existing houses. Theassumption would be made that authorities should be receiving from existing houses a total rent income equivalent to 2 G.V., rebates where necessary being provided by charging higher rents to those able to pay more, supplemented as necessary by a contribution from the rates. the broad intention would be to vary the subsidy where the test showed that an authority possessed resources out of which it could bridge the gap between the cost and the rent of such new houses as it needed tobuild. Authorities with such resources would get less subsidy, or evennone at all; those without resources would get more.The special subsidies for flats and expensive sites would have to beretained.The intention would be to fix a new standard subsidy payable to authorities satisfying the rent test, a subsidy that could be increasedwhere needs were exceptionally heavy, and decreased where theauthority had financial resources, potential or actual, in their housingaccount. To safeguard the Exchequer the aim would be to fix thenew standard subsidy at a level which, allowing for the increases anddecreases and all the special subsidies, would contain the annualaddition to the Exchequer commitment within its existing limits.Further, I propose that the subsidy should not be promised over thewhole 60-year period of the loan, as has been the practice in the past.If wages continue to increase, capacity to pay rent increases and theamount of annual subsidy required goes dowh. I would propose totake power to review the annual payment at fixed intervals, possibly by reference to the level of earnings.Payment of subsidies on this basis would mean that some authorities which deliberately pursue low rent policies would for a time get much less new subsidy than at present, even though they still have large and urgent housing needs to meet in their areas. It would mean, over aperiod, increases in many municipal rents, increases which in some townsmight amount ultimately to 20s. a week or more before the authoritycould qualify for full subsidy on new building (that is the measure of the inadequacy of their existing rents).  The increases would take effect by
degrees. Examples are Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where rents at present are far below the level which the tenantscould reasonably be expected to pay. Many London County Councilrents would also have to be increased. All these authorities would stillbe able to continue building if they would face the necessary rent increases. It would be a question of forcing them to do their duty, andthere would be storms. The ratepayers generally of course would stand to gain rather than to lose by one section the Council tenants being required to pay sensible rents. The people on the waiting listwould gain, because Council tenants no longer featherbedded by subsidies they did not require would in a good many cases start thinking of house purchase.(b) We should pay subsidies for any purposes for which the local authorityreally need to build, e.g., slum clearance, general needs, relief ofovercrowding, old people; and (apart from the subsidies for overspillbuilding and for housing for incoming industrial workers) pay the same amount of subsidy per dwelling, as determined under (a), for all purposes,but weight it in favour of those authorities with a great deal of slum clearance still to do.These arrangements would allow for the varying housing needs tobe met by local authorities, and while giving them an incentive to pushon with slum clearance as vigorously as they can, would leave themfree to allocate their new building (without fear of loss of subsidy) to whatever needs seem to them to be most pressing.(c) We should enable housing associations to obtain subsidy direct from theExchequer for building for old people, or for any other approvedpurpose which would entail letting below economic rents. The amountof subsidy would be the standard amount referred to in (a) above.At present, a housing association can only get subsidy through thelocal authority, and then only where it enters into approvedarrangements with the authority for the carrying out of a particularscheme. This is unsatisfactory because it puts the local authority inthe position of being able to frustrate building by a housing association,by refusing to collaborate or by insisting that any houses built by an association must be let to tenants on the CounciFs waiting list. Removalof this limitation would give freedom of initiative to housing associations and stimulate some of them to fresh activity: a very desirable development.(d) We should tackle the problem of overspill building more vigorously and give it a new impetus by doing two things.The first is to improve the subsidy available to local authoritieswhen building for overspill purposes under town development schemes.Town development, like new town building, has to be self-supporting,allowing only for the Exchequer contribution and for such additional assistance as the exporting authority can be induced to give. Theauthority that agrees to receive population from a distance cannot beexpected to contribute to the house-building cost out of the rates, orout of the rents of its existing tenants. This form of public housinghas therefore been hit worse by the rising rate of interest than any other.Even where the all-in contribution is  32 per annum (12s. 3d. a week)it is not enough to bridge the gap between cost (50s. net rent for athree-bedroom house) and the net rents that can be paid (on average30s. to 35s. a week). The contribution needs to be somewhat increased,to  38 or  40; and the receiving authorities need to be assured of continued additional help beyond the first 10 years if need can thenbe shown.Secondly, we should be prepared, if need is proved, to initiate thebuilding of one or two more new towns. I have mentioned the effortsI am making to improve the at present almost non-existent rate ofdecentralisation from Birmingham and Liverpool. If it proves, as itmay, that for either or both of those places action on a new town scaleis part of the appropriate solution, I am certain that we ought to be
willing to build those towns ourselves. In recent years we have taken the line that if Birmingham or Liverpool or any other powerfulauthority need a new town to relieve their congestion, they shouldbuild it themselves; but it would be very difficult now for them to raisethe necessary capital, quite apart from which there is no doubt thatbuilding by a Government agency is very much more acceptable to thepeople In the county concerned than building by one of these greatmunicipalities.I should of course seek to agree any specific proposal for the siting of a new town, or of any town expansion, with those of mycolleagues principally concerned.(e) We should encourage the improvement and conversion of older houses by making the return to owners on their expenditure more attractive.At present an owner carrying out improvements or conversionswith the aid of grant is limited in the rent he may charge afterimprovement. In the case of improvement of a single-family dwelling(as opposed to conversion into two or more units) the rent increase may not be more than 8 per cent, of the owner&apos;s share of the expenditureon the improvement works. This percentage addition offers noworthwhile return to the owner, and needs to be increased to something like 12 per cent, to provide an incentive. Some comparable easementis also needed (though the form would have to be different) in order toencourage more conversion work.Reaction of the Local Authorities35. If these proposals are agreed in broad outline, I would propose to settledetails with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and then discuss them in confidencewith the representatives of the local authorities. As the.great municipalities will bethe main losers, I must expect opposition from their representatives. But I would find support from other quarters; the scheme would be attractive to authoritiesalready charging adequate rents and with heavy tasks still ahead.IV. Rented Houses36. There are two great gaps in the existing housing situation which theproposals I have made in section III above will do nothing to remedy. One isthat since the war private enterprise has done almost no building to let. Anyonewanting a house nowadays has virtually only two choices: to buy or to become a council tenant. Opportunities of renting privately-owned houses are still very few.37. The other gap is that the present private owners of rented houses are, inmany cases, deficient as landlords. They are not modernising the houses; theyare not even maintaining them properly. For small owners and there are manyof them this can be very difficult; often they lack the resources or the competenceto do the job properly. Often, too, they are simply rent-drawers; they do not understand the importance of good management if their property is to retain its value. Furthermore, after years of rent control the one aim of many landlordsquite naturally is to get rid of their property, rather than to spend any more money on it.38. This weakness in landlordism makes us very vulnerable. The Socialists&apos;remedy for it is municipalisation. We reject that but we have yet to find a positive solution of our own.39. I have been considering what might be done to deal with these problems,and confidential talks have been held with representatives of the builders and building societies. As a result it seems clear that though a few builders wouldbe interested in building to let (a very few are already doing some), this will not amount to much. Finance is the big difficulty. Few builders have resources toenable them to tie up capital over a long period, even to the extent of putting ina 10 per cent, stake. In any event they would need to obtain up to 90 per cent, ofthe cost on mortgage, and on terms which would avoid the necessity of the builderhaving to feed in further capital during the repayment period. This means thatloans on mortgage would need to be spread over at least 30 years, which is longer than building societies are ordinarily prepared to consider quite apart from the
fact that their main interest is in lending for owner-occupation. One or twobuilding societies might be induced to make finance available for rented housinghere and there; and it is possible that capital might be obtained from insurance and investment companies. But they would in general look for a higher returnthan rented housing can provide. It seems therefore that we cannot at present hope for much from private sources.40. Apart from straight building to let. a few builders are interested in thepossibility of building for co-operative housing groups, as is now widely done inthe Scandinavian countries. The attraction of this method is that the occupants,organised in a estate society, themselves provide the equity capital by taking upshares and are the collective owners of the property with full responsibility formortgage repayments, maintenance and management. This is a form of self-help which I think is well worth encouraging. The co-operating and collectiveowner-occupiers could not at present, however, get any tax relief on their interest payments, as individual owner-occupiers buying on mortgage can do; and thisI propose to discuss with the Chancellor.41. I have also looked into the possibility of promoting housing trusts orassociations (a) to build to let at economic rents, and (b) to purchase, repair and improve houses which landlords cannot look after properly. My first idea was thatthe building societies might be willing to support bodies of this kind and to put up the bulk of the finance. I had hoped too that they (and the builders) might be actively associated with the formation of such bodies. But this has led nowhere.The building societies are just not interested in this sort of housing activity and Ican see no prospect of help coming from them, except perhaps for one ortwo experimental schemes. The builders simply take the view that they do not wantany other agency encouraged to build to let.42. In this situation the only way I can see of making progress would be forthe Government to be prepared to lend money, at current rates of interest, to approved housing trusts or associations willing to build to let without subsidy andon a non-profit-making basis. This might be done through a Housing Corporation.Alternatively, some form of guarantee scheme might be worked out under whichthe Exchequer would underwrite borrowing by such trusts in the market. Eitherway, it would be necessary for the trusts to borrow the bulk of their capitallong-term, i.e., up to 60 years, in order to make it possible for rents to be kept to a level which tenants can pay. If housing trusts or associations could be got goingin this way, in addition to building to let they could be enabled in due course topurchase, improve and manage existing houses. They could become anon-municipal means of replacing the private landlord who is unable or unwilling to look after his property properly, and thus provide us with an alternative to thedrift towards municipalisation. A proposal of this kind, coupled with those set outin section III, would enable the Government to present to the country a comprehensive housing policy.43. I understand that the Chancellor may be opposed to this idea of stimulating building to let, for two main reasons: first, on the view that as manyhouses are being built as the economy can stand; and second, because the lendingof money for rented housing at the Exchequer (or Public Works Loan Board) lendingrate can be regarded as a form of concealed subsidy (since for this purpose, with itsattendant risks, the market would look for a substantially higher rate). Though thehousing trusts would be expected to meet the full cost to the Exchequer, they mightfail to do so, especially if there were a depression. There is also the point thatlending for this purpose would increase the Exchequer^ below-the-linecommitments.44. I can well understand that there may be anxiety about adding to thevolume of housing investment, and that it may look to be too soon to be pushingbuilding to let at a time when building for sale is running stronger than ever. Butas against this, it will at best be a slow business getting housing trusts on to their feet,and I would in any event propose to start on a small scale and to count any houses built in this way against the public programme. Thus there would, for the timebeing, be no question of adding to the total number of houses that would be builtanyhow.45. As to the possible objection that an arrangement on these lines wouldinvolve a concealed subsidy, I of course agree that houses built or bought to rentoffer a less reliable investment than houses built or bought for owner-occupation.
There would certainly be an element of risk in trying to encourage building to let ateconomic rents at the present time. Most private rents are still controlled, andguaranteed by our election pledge against any increase during the present parliament. In these circumstances the scope for letting at economic rents is, at best, limited. But the builders I have consulted believe that there is a demand whichwould make itself felt once it was known that someone would build houses to let,and that the Government wanted to see this done.46. It is in my view tremendously important politically to break the presentmonopoly of local authorities in building to let. Private enterprise is not going tobreak it; its market is in building to sell. But housing trusts, working on a non-profit making basis, and given access to the necessary finance for repayment over60 years, could provide houses at net rents of between  3 and  4 a week. Theycould thus cater for the many families in the middle income group who do not wish or cannot afford to buy and v/ould otherwise have no option but to look to thelocal authorities. It would be worth while in my view to take power to lendmoney to approved trusts if only to get them building (and also converting and improving) for the elderly and other classes specially in need of help. But I believethat quite apart from this it is important to demonstrate that our party recognises the general need for some new rented housing and for good management, and hasan alternative to municipalisation an alternative which might contain the seedsof a great new housing movement. If we were to launch it now, we would I believemake some progress in expanding the housing association movement before thenext election, and I think that that could be important too.47. In any event I want to get housing trusts going in some of the new towns,to provide for the continued building of rented houses after the development corporations have completed the main task of bringing people into the towns.Somebody has got to continue house-building in these towns, although on a reduced scale; and while private enterprise is showing an increasing willingness to build in them for owner-occupation (and I am anxious to encourage this, within limits) itdoes not meet the main continuing need, which is to provide houses at moderaterents for those who work in the towns. I do not want the local authorities to haveto carry out all the future building of rented houses in these towns (for whichincidentally they would certainly expect Exchequer assistance, as they have fewolder houses over which to spread their costs), nor do I want the central commission which is to succeed the Corporations to be a major house-building authority in a dozen towns. The chairmen of the Development Corporations, whom I have consulted, believe that there is scope in the towns for better-class housing at or near to economic rents, and I think it would be appropriate that the Corporations should establish Housing Trusts to undertake this, financing them through the New TownsAccount. I hope to reach agreement with the Chancellor on this.Summary48.   Housing policy needs to be developed further for three main purposes:(a) To secure a better and more rational use of subsidy.(b) To make a start on building to let at unsubsidised rents.(c) To encourage the better management and maintenance of privately rented accommodation. ,49.   I seek:(a) Approval in principle to the broad proposals outlined in section III above for dealing with subsidy, the details to be worked out in agreement withthe Chancellor, with a view to introduction of a Bill next Session.(b) The views of the Cabinet on whether an attempt should be made by theloan of Exchequer money to get housing trusts established to build to let, and when opportunity offers to purchase and improve and manageprivately rented houses; and, if so, whether the necessary provision should be made in the same Bill.H.
