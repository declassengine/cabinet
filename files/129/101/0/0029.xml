(THIS D  C&quot; ME&apos;&quot;TT IS THE P?OFE.?Ti:&apos; &quot;\F HER BRITANNIC MA JEST iHS GOVERNMENT )C.(60) 796th May, I960CA . I :ETPENSIONS:  TIMING OF THE    EXT MOVEMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor. We have undertaken, in our Election Manifesto, &quot;to ensure thatpensioners continue to share in the good things which a steadilyexpanding economy will bring&quot;.   The Social Cervices Committee havebeen considering the timing of the first move to give effect to this pledge.2. The Minister of Pensions considers that the pledge, though notcontaining any specific commitment as to time and amount, has createdan impression that we would increase pension benefits at an early date and that a failure to introduce legislation before the summer recess would therefore be damaging to the reputation of the Government.   There are other grounds for an early move.    First, the Government Actuary hasmade his quinquennial report to the Treasury on the financial conditionof the National Insurance Fund:  this will be published before Whit sunand thereafter the Minister of Pensions will have to report to parliament on whether the benefits ought to be altered.   Second, there has been asubstantial increase in average earnings since the last increase in national insurance benefits came into force in January, 1958.3.        The Committee have agreed, however, that we must not do anything which might have the effect of postponing the inception , inApril, 1961, of the new graduated scheme under the 1959 Act.   To introduceonly a few months before that date legislation to increase pensions and contributions might, however, cause confusion to those who have to decide whether or not to contract out of the graduated scheme and so giverise to pressures to delay its introduction.   Alternatively, earlierlegislation would face us with the problem of how to finance increasedpensions for the months before the new scheme began:   we could hardlyincrease contributions for this purpose, when in the following Aprilthey are due to be reduced for the lower paid;  and the Chancellor of theExchequer is quite clear that he cannot provide more money from theExchequer or run down the National Insurance Fund further.   The costof living has been reasonably steady since the last increase in pensionsand in all the circumstances there seems no obligation on the Governmentto make another increase yet.   The majority of the Committee, therefore,take the view that the position can and should be held until April, 1961.The Minister of Pensions has, however, clearly warned us thatsome pressure for a pension increase is to be expected following thequinnquennial review, and that a move later in the year might riskpostponement of the new graduated scheme.   To legislate   this autumnfor an increase to take effect immediately after 1st April, 1961, wouldalso be likely to generate demands for postponement of the new scheme:-1-COPY   TO.   ^ O
we should of course have to resist these and it will be the less difficultto do so if, as we envisage, the increase is limited to the minimum andflat-rate contributions.    On the other hand, to introduce legislationimmediately after 1st April, 1961, would lead to charges of bad faithon the ground that the Government had deliberately concealed its intention to alter the structure of the National Insurance Scheme duringthe period when employees and employers were having to decide what attitude to adopt to that scheme.   If, therefore, we do not legislate before april, 1961, it may in practice mean that legislation cannot be introduced for some time thereafter and that pensions cannot be raised before theautumn of 1961 at the earliest - two years or more after the GeneralElection.5.        Nevertheless the Social Services Committee agreed to deferfurther consideration of an increase until the autumn, on the understandingthat the Minister of Pensions could raise the matter at any time earlierif he considered it necessary.   In the meantime, the Minister has, at therequest of the Committee, worked out alternative forms which the nextpensions increase might take, whenever it comes: these include thepossibility of differentiating in favour of the older pensioner, either by concentrating the whole increase on the over-seventies or by introducing a higher rate of benefit for them.   We propose to consider also whetherit would be right, for the future, to rely to a greater extent on the moreselective instrument of national assistance.6. In short, the choice before us.on timing appears to be:-(a) To legislate now for an increase in pensions next autumn.   Ifwe moved immediately, we should probably be able to resist subsequentpressure for postponement of the new graduated scheme next April butthe financial difficulties are great.(b) To legislate this autumn for an increase in pensions next April,when the new scheme is due to take effect, with subsequent pressure (whichwe should of course have to resist) to postpone the start of the new scheme on that date.(c) To legislate after next April for a pensions increase in the autumn of 1961 at the earliest.The majority of the Social Services Committee are not in favour of (a).They have concluded that the best course is to wait until the autumn to reconsider the matter, noting and accepting the risk that (b) may thenappear impractical, so that we should be left with (c). The objectionto (c) is that it would entail a long delay before the next move actuallytook place: we should have to be very resolute to hold the position for so long.House of Lords, S.W.I.6th May, i960-2-
