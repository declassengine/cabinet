o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 65 COPY NO.4th April, I960CABINETPOLICY IN THE SOMALILAND PROTECTORATEMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial AffairsEver since the United Nations decided that Somalia should become independent in I960, we have had to take account of the desire of the peopleof the Protectorate to join it in framing our policies.     In February, 1959, the then Colonial Secretary made an agreed statement in Hargeisa.    The text of the statement is annexed.2.      This statement greatly improved sentiment in Somaliland.Subsequently a vigorous party political campaign led up to elections to thenew Legislative Council in February this year.    The first proclaimedobjective of all parties was &quot;independence and union with Somalia&quot;.3.      The new Legislative Council meets for the first time on 5th April.The Governor informed us that a group of strongly nationalist back-benchersintended to introduce a motion calling for steps to be taken forthwith for theimmediate unification of the Protectorate with Somalia, and for independencefor the Protectorate on 1st July (the date when Somalia becomes independent).He also advised us that his more responsible Ministers, notably his leader of Government Business, admitted privately that this motion wasunrealistic and that they would not mind, and indeed be relieved, if her majesty&apos;s Government stalled on it.    We were therefore going on the linesthat the Governor should say in his opening speech that, while her majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to fulfil Mr. Lennox-BoydTsundertaking to facilitate negotiations, they could not do so until anindependent Government came into being in Somalia, and that it was there-fore impossible for union to take place on 1st July.4.      Within the last three days, however, the Governor has reported thata wave of excitement has developed, in part stimulated by the action ofthe Somalia Assembly which has passed a motion calling for the unification,if possible before 1st July, of all the Somali peoples, i. e. , those in the protectorate, Kenya, Ethiopia and French Somaliland.    This excitementhas affected all the elected members of the Legislative and executive councils in the Protectorate, who have shown no patience with theGovernor^ arguments that, because of the many practical problems to be solved (see paragraph 7 below) before independence and unification can come about, it is unrealistic to insist upon the target date of 1st July.The Governor has now advised us that, were he to persist in this statement,this might provoke disturbances which in turn would require him to bring in British troops since, in the emotional political atmosphere, the localpolice and security forces (the Somali Scouts) could not be relied on.    Inthe circumstances I agreed with him that he should not say anything aboutthe motion in his opening speech to the Legislative Council.-1-$ECMEtf
5.      Nevertheless, during the debate on the motion, the Governor willprobably be pressed to make our position clear.    If we say nothing, we shall probably still be blamed for standing in the way of Somali wishes, and at best provoke considerable ill-will.    To avoid this, the Governor^representative might be authorised to make the following statement later in the debate:-&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to do all that isrequired of them to prepare Somaliland so that, should both countries wish it, union may take place at the earliest possibleconvenient date between an independent Somaliland and anindependent Somalia.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government understandSomali feelings, but equally would ask the elected representa-tives and people to understand, in the same helpful spirit, the many practical difficulties involved. &quot;6.      By making such a statement we may find ourselves committed to independence for the Protectorate on 1st July (although I feel that, for practical reasons, this is doubtful) and that we will have to act in future insuch a way that we will not be open to the charge of dragging our feet.    Ifthis policy is accepted, it should be made clear that we are ready to givethe Protectorate its independence at an early date for only one purpose,namely, union with Somalia.    This, it is to be hoped, would do something to lessen demands for earlier independence in other territories in EastAfrica, and Aden.    At the same time, our international interests make itdesirable that we should not allow ourselves to be accused of deliberatelyencouraging union, and even less of encouraging Somali expansionisttendencies.    The Somali nationalistic movement may snowball, trying tobring in the Somalis in Kenya, Ethiopia and French Somaliland.    We willhave to state publicly that we are not in favour of this.    The Governor of kenya has been asked for an assessment of the situation likely to develop in his Northern Province.7.     Apart from the fact that the Somaliland Protectorate is notadministratively or economically ready for independence, the outstandingpractical problems which will need to be resolved are:-(a) Legal and constitutional.    These are being urgentlyexamined by legal authorities, with particular reference to the question whether legislation isrequired.(b) Financial, with particular reference to the undertaking in paragraph 7 of Mr. Lennox-Boyd&apos;s statement.(c) Transfer of administration for the Somali Scouts (atpresent administered by the War Office) to localcontrol.(d) Arrangements to secure the pension and other benefits of the Civil Service.(e) Arrangements for tribesmen from the Protectorate tocontinue to move into Ethiopian territory to grazetheir herds, since the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreementof 1954 would lapse upon independence.
(f) Currency:   the Protectorate is in the sterling area andSomalia in the lira bloc.(g) Satisfactory arrangements about the lease of the new british Broadcasting Corporation relay station atBerbera.(h) Probable securing of overflying and staging rights formilitary and chartered aircraft - which appear to be our only defence requirements.8.      Despite these problems and the difficulties outlined in paragraph 6, I 1ask my colleagues to approve the line of policy proposed in paragraph 5 above in the realisation that it may possibly result in the Protectorate becomingpart of a union with Somalia from 1st July, whereas at the time when mr. Lennox-Boyd made his statement no union for two or three years hadbeen contemplated.P.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.4th April, I960.ANNEXPOLICY STATEMENT:   THE SOMALI LANDPROTECTORATE(Issued by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 9th February, 1959, at Hargeisa)Last November, the Governor announced certain constitutionaladvances and after the forthcoming elections the Protectorate will have forthe first time a Legislative Council which includes elected members andsome of these elected members will be making themselves familiar withthe work of some departments of Government.2.      When he made his statement the Governor made it clear that further constitutional progress was being planned.    In considering this matterHer Majesty&apos;s Government have thought it right to pay special regard to thefact that the neighbouring territory of Somalia is due to become independent,when the Trusteeship Agreement between the United Nations and theItalian Government comes to an end in December, I960.    In these specialcircumstances Her Majesty1 s Government think that there is justification for proceeding with constitutional development in the Protectorate at afaster pace than they believe to be suitable or advantageous in more normal circumstances elsewhere.    I can now say that it is the intention of Her
Majesty&apos;s Government that by the end of I960 there shall be an electedunofficial majority in the Legislative Council, together with a Ministerialsystem under which a number of unofficial members of the LegislativeCouncil will become members of the Executive Council with executive responsibilities in Government.3.      These changes will raise important issues which will need to beconsidered.    The Governor intends shortly to appoint a Commission to make recommendations to him on the number of representative members in thenext Legislative Council, the method of their selection, constituencies and similar matters.     This Commission will also be asked to consider theplace of the traditional tribal authorities in relation to the legislative and executive organs of Government and how these authorities may best be associated with the future working of the constitution.4.      The changes foreshadowed for I960 will also involve a re-organisationof the Government machine and some adjustment of the present budgetaryarrangements.    The Governor proposes to set in train the necessaryexamination of these problems at once so that in due time recommendationscan be made to me about any changes which should be made in the present arrangements.5.      By the end of I960 there will thus be an unofficial majority in theLegislative Council and Somalis with executive responsibility in the Govern-ment.     Thereafter, it is the intention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government toarrange such further constitutional steps as may be necessary to lead to early self-government.6.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government is aware of the desire expressed by manySomalis of the Protectorate that there should be a closer association between this territory and Somalia.    If, therefore, when Somalia hasbecome independent, the Legislative Council of the Protectorate formallyresolves that negotiations with the Government of Somalia be instituted todetermine the terms and conditions on which a closer association of the two territories might be achieved, Her Majestyrs Government in the UnitedKingdom would be ready to transmit this resolution to the Government ofSomalia and enquire whether that Government would be willing to enterinto negotiation.    If so, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would arrange for negotiations of a suitable nature to take place.7.      Whatever the eventual destiny of the Protectorate, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will continue to take an interest in the welfare of its inhabitants,and will in the light of the circumstances prevailing from time to time, beprepared to give sympathetic consideration to the continuation of financialassistance within the limits of the amount of aid at present being provided to the Protectorate.
