2 CONFIDENTIALVISIT TO CERTAIN MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES-MARCH 1960 IReport by the Head of the Levant Department; Foreign Office ^L-WOn this journey I visited Episkopi, Nicosia, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, Amman, ^L-9mJerusalem and Tel Aviv. I was able to discuss all matters of current interest with ^L-Wdtic,Missions arid to have a number of conversations with leading people in thearea. These talks no doubt added little if anything to what our Heads of Missionshave been reporting and I do not attempt to record individual views in detail:I propose below to give my brief impressions of some outstanding issues in thisarea at present, in the light of what I heard during my tour, and to make a few ^L-Wgeneral observations. For the sake of completeness I annex a list of the people Italked .to, outside our own Missions.United Arab Republic/Israel I wMMMMI did not find the Egyptians I spoke to obsessed with the question of Israel ^L-W^L\%W in the same way as the Israelis are obsessed with the United Arab Republic(U.A.R.)-even though my talks coincided with the visit to London of the Israel ^k-wmPrime Minister, Mr. Ben Gurion.  Nevertheless the increased antagonism between ^L-Wthese two ill-proportioned States is the main political issue at present in the Levantand seems likely to remain so- Dr. Murad Ghaleb spoke to me as he had alreadyspoken to Mr. Crowe, Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, about the U.A.RVs policy ^L-Wto &quot; contain &quot; Israel.  In reply to a question he said that this policy implied astringent application of the Arab boycott and the continuation of the Suez Canalblockade.  I argued the case for allowing normal Israel trade to pass the Canal ^L-Wunder the arrangements made by the Secretary of the United Nations, providedforeign ownership could be shown, but Dr. Ghaleb seemed less forthcoming onthis point thari when he had spoken to Mr. Crowe (and raised bur hopes) a month ^L-Wbefore. Mr. Heikal, confidant of the President of the United Arab Republic, whowas responsible for negotiating the resumption of diplomatic relations withMr. Crowe, had little to say directly about Israel but he-and indeed everyone- ^L-Wemphasised that the supply of further arms by us to Israel could not be accompaniedby an improvement in relations with the U.A.R.Nobody in Cairo seemed to think it necessary to explain, interpret or apologisefor the speeches made by the President of the U.A.R., Colonel Nasser, in Damascus.The Lebanese Permanent Under-Secretary told me that Colonel Nasser&apos;s receptionin the Northern Region had exceeded in enthusiasm anything seen there before ^L-WWMMMM               and that this explained the demagogic content of the speeches.  Mr. Heikal said ^k^Wthat the recent setback to the growth of Anglo-U.A.R. confidence was due toreferences in London to the Tripartite Declaration, the United KingdomPrime Minister&apos;s statement that he was glad to share ther responsibility^^fl               for Suez, and the visits of Messrs. Ben Gurion and Peres to London. ^L-WWMMMM I was surprised to find the normally rond*de-cuir Mr. Hassouna to be themost doctrinaire and intransigent of the people I talked to in Cairo.  He ^LwM^k\%\ harangued me for over an hour about the world&apos;s responsibility for the i k-MMPalestine refugees, the Arab refusal to resettle them and the need for a Palestine ^k-wmentity.  No doubt this was because the Arab League had just been working onthis problem, without much result.  (Also Mr. Hassouna has a position to keepup-he published his views as outlined to me in the Press the next day.)Mr. Hassouna had a number of points to make about curtailing the growth ofIsrael influence {e.g., Israel diplomatic representation in Cyprus). One gets the wMMMMimpression that action to contain Israel is being pursued by the U.A.R. very muchas an Arab League exercise at present and that the U.A.R. does not contemplate ^k-wma direct showdown with Israel in the near future.   However, so personal and ^k-wm^LWm                unpredictable is the policy of Colonel Nasser that the most one can say is that the ^k-wmCairo mood seemed fairly relaxed and confident, as might have been expectedfrom their recent diplomatic successes: the policy towards Israel seems likely to        I wMMMMbe one of steady pressure but no &quot; Jihad&quot;.Naturally enough, the Israelis see the situation differently. They want notonly a direct improvement in their margin of safety through the supply of more ^L-Wand better arms but they need the indirect boost to their morale which is alwaysrepresented by getting these arms from a powerful friend. From Mrs. Meirdownwards they are beginning to talk again in terms of survival and fighting to thelast woman and child. Arms, and the ability to be in some way associated with a TLwM^LW CONFIDENTIAL
^[ CONFIDENTIAL 3Western Power in military training and supply, is becoming the only issue for Israel.The World Bank loan for Canal development, so long a cause of bitter complaint,has been thrust into the subconscious mind. The whole issue of Suez Canal transit^^fl I is hardly mentioned.   Indeed it was raised only to be dismissed by one official,who said that Israel must draw the obvious conclusions, claim equal belligerentrights against the U.A.R. and abstain from hopeless attempts to secure pass$gj&gt; L^Hthrough a waterway which lay within Egyptian control. No doubt this outburstwas not typical but we must recognise, in the words of our Ambassador, that theIsrael attitude has deteriorated in recent months, i.e., become more embattled andaggressive.  To-day the subsidiary diplomatic issues fought by Israel throughout^^fl 1959, partly on their merits and partly to whip up international sympathy, havegiven way to an uncompromising demand for increased military strength.Unfortunately, given the Israel character and the facts of war, few of the arms theywant can be described as purely defensive.  Nevertheless Israel can make a caseI for improved equipment in the light of increasing U.A.R. pressure. In some waysher best case is for anti-aircraft defence, in view of the U.A.R. ability to run ashuttle bomber service between the Southern and Northern Regions.^^fl I Both in Cairo and Jerusalem I had the impression that our efforts to strike abalance between Israel and the Arab world were viewed with some suspicion butthat no one questioned our right-indeed our duty-^to play a role in the area.Mr. Heikal went out of his way to say that the British interest in the Middle East1 should be sustained: ovir influence must continue. The Israelis accept the fact thata resumption of United Kingdom-U.A.R. relations can in the long run representa moderating influence in Cairo but they do not rate such considerations highlyand insist that their only hope is to remain too tough a nut to crack.Tripartite DeclarationThe preceding sentences lead me to a brief mention of the TripartiteDeclaration, brief because I did not find that anyone regarded it as of muchpractical significance. In spite of Colonel Nasser&apos;s outbursts, no one in Cairoshowed any particular interest in the Declaration.   In Jerusalem the Director*I General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while the Declaration hadServed a purpose, it no longer seemed fully adapted to the circumstances.Mrs. Meir was adamant that Israel could not in any case rely on the West, theUnited Nations or world opinion to save her in time in the event of a U.A.R.| attack. If Israel should herself become weak enough to invite such an attack, she L^Hwould have been obliterated by the time the West stepped in to save her.Governmental opinion in Israel certainly seems to have moved towards the idea ofassociating the Soviet Union in some way with the Western Powers to maintainthe status quo, though it is not clear why Israel should expeot the Soviet Union tomodify its present pohcy of pleasing the Arabs at the expense of Israel. L^HJordan WatersI did not meet with much interest in this subject. The Lebanese Prime Ministertook the stock Arab line and said that the first action by Israel to draw water wouldbe a casus belli for the Arabs.  On the official side in Jordan I did not find any1 special anxiety about the resulting threat to farming on the lower reaches of theJordan, either by the reduction of water available or by an increase in salinity of thewater leaving Lake Tiberias. But Mr. Musa Alami expressed concern about theprospects of a grave increase in salinity.  He also argued that too much attentionI has been given to projects for tapping water and too little to the need for teachingfarmers to cultivate irrigated land. He himself has drilled enough water for his farmproject at Jericho and is teaching a new generation of Arab refugee orphans to clearthe land from salt by the process of cultivation.A Palestine &quot; Entity&quot;- and the Palestine RefugeesThe Secretary-General of the Arab League insisted on explaining exactly whatthis phrase meant. It did not mean that the Arabs expected to throw Israel into thesea. &quot; Entity &quot; did not refer to the original Palestine as a unit. The Arabic word&quot; Kian &quot; signified &quot; essence &quot; or &quot; existence &quot;. There must be something to carryon the name of Palestine against the day when a final solution of the Palestineproblem might be reached. The U.A.R. was training some of the refugees asPalestinian, not Egyptian, soldiers.   The refugees themselves were a world^[ CONFIDENTIALb 2
^LWk 4 &apos; CONFIDENTIAL^^^H              responsibility. - There was no particular reason why they should be resettled by 1 WXWM^L^-M               other Arab countries. They ought to be given the choice of going to any country ^LwM^L^-M               in the world if they could not be granted their first demand, which was to go home. ^LjM%MmM               The Kingdom of Jordan had accepted custody of most of the refugees and a part ^LwM^L^-M               cf Palestine against the day of a final settlement. He was sure this was generally I UMM^L^-m understood. When I saw King Hussein, his anger at the U.A.R. attitude on this ^LyM^L^-M               subject had largely subsided, but the row over the terms of the U.A.R. Consul-^^^H               General in Jerusalem&apos;s exequatur and the U.A.R. propaganda about a &quot; Palestine ^LwM^L^km                entity &quot; had obviously rankled a great deal with the Prime Minister as well as the BVM^L^-M                King. Seen from Jordan, the way in which the U.A.R. have been playing this handin the Arab League is clearly designed to upset and diminish Jordan. However onedoes not get the impression that the policy has been pursued with much conviction ^kjM^m^km                by Cairo.  Nor has it done Colonel Nasser much good on the West Bank.  The MmU^LwWM ex-Prime Minister, Mr. Samir Rifai, thought that the King and his Government had ^kwM^L^km               made a mistake in allowing themselves to be drawn too far in answering this^^^1                Egyptian feint.   It remains to be seen whether the feint is followed up by a ^kjMMmWM                determined attempt to embarrass Jordan on the West Bank. I WmM^LWwM The inhuman attitude of both Israel and the Arab States towards the Palestine ^LwM^L^km               refugees is deplorable. The refugees have become a political symbol, a weapon inthe struggle between the two sides. Israel hopes that annual aid for the refugees can ^kjM^LWjM               be stopped so that their resettlement will be forced upon the Arabs.  The Arab MWM^LWjM                States insist that the refugees must not be resettled because they represent the main ^kjM^LWjM                element of a Palestine entity and must be preserved intact as a bargaining counter ^kjM^LwWm                in a political settlement, the likelihood of achieving which they are the first to ^kwM^kjkm                discount. Meanwhile the admirable Mr. Musa Alami is virtually alone in his private I BMW^LWjM                enterprise to help some of the refugee orphans who are not on the rolls.  And he ^mVM^k^km                meets with little enough encouragement from the Jordanian Government. ^k^k\WKwLM               Jordan, Syria and Iraq ^LwMMr. Heikal was prolific in assurances that the U.A.R. did not want trouble^LlkW                in Jordan or Iraq.  He claimed that the Syrian Baathists had been foremost in ^kyMpressing for an activist policy by the U.A.R. in both countries.   He gave me a ^LjMdetailed outline of the reasons (connected with a land reform case) why the ^mVM^L-W                Baathist Ministers had come to tender their resignation and implied that their m-Mdeparture had made it easier for Colonel Nasser and his entourage to step more ^mVM^LjkW                warily in Jordan and Iraq.   King Hussein might keep a feudal regime but the ^mVMWX^m.                U.A.R. nevertheless did not want trouble with him.  In Iraq certain &quot; chemical ^LwMprocesses &quot; had been active for months and they would continue for some time. ^LwMDuring this difficult period it was a U.A.R. interest that Qasim should continue Mmmto rule. It would be dangerous for the individuals or parties who were friends of ^LwM-MmU                the TJ.A.R. to be exposed to the processes of government at this stage.  In short, ^LwMMr. Heikal was at pains to represent the U.A.R. as pursuing a cautious policy ^LwMin the Arab world, containing Israel, picking no quarrel with Jordan and -Mm^k^km                 observing from afar the chemical processes active in Iraq.Anglo-American RelationsEverywhere except Tel Aviv (where my time was limited by illness) I met the^^^B                American representatives.   Relations both locally and as between London and ^k^MWashington seem to be about as good as could be expected but there is clearly ^k^k\^k^km a latent risk of friction in Cairo and Amman.   In Cairo I doubt whether therelations between our two Embassies have been fully satisfactory since SenatorCaffery&apos;s day. With the advent of a new United States Ambassador (Mr. Reinhardt) ^k^L\and others well known to members of our Mission, and with the eventual ^k^Mre-establishment of a British Embassy after a gap of several years, it may be hoped ^L^k\that the two Missions will now become as close as they should be.  Certainly the ^L^k\^k^kw                position of the Canadian Ambassador in Cairo shows that the Egyptians are Ianxious not to rely exclusively on the United States for Western tutelage. So long ^L^Mas the U.A.R. is not behaving much worse than at present towards our interests inAfrica there should be little cause of friction between British and United States ^k^Mpolicy in the U.A.R.   Meanwhile, I had the impression from our call at the^^^fl United States Embassy that there is still a certain constraint at such meetings. The^^^1: United States Counsellor seemed critical of the Jordanian reaction to the recentU.A.R. propaganda attacks and one had the impression that we were regardedas Jordan&apos;s keeper.CONFIDENTIAL ^LW
^LM CONFIDENTIAL S WMMIt is indeed the independent position of Jordan, in view of the massive support^LwM I now being given by the United States to the U.A.R., which is the main source ofMJmm potential friction in. Anglo-American policy.  The pattern would be neater,,from ^^^Hthe United States point of view, if the antithesis between Colonel Nasser andKing Hussein.did not exist and United States money did not have to be poured ^^^Jinto the lesser as well as the greater channel.   Moreover, Jordan is not the sort^LWM of country which the United States Government are well equipped to understand!!&apos; KSJ^LWm Fortunately the Point Four representative at Amman is admirably co-operativei -Mx^Lm towards our Embassy, as is his Ambassador.   Nevertheless one could wish thatthe latter carried more guns so that he could better justify in Washington thelarge United. States expenditure on Jordan and possibly also see that the Jordanians^L^LM spend it better.   It is flattering that our representative in Jordan should givethe advice and the United States the money but one would willingly reverse theposition (at least as regards advice) for the sake of a greater United StatesBJ involvement.United States policy moreover leaves us with some embarrassing decisions which^L^LM the United States Government consciously prefer that we should take.  They are^L^LM i       not prepared to supply heavy military equipment to the Middle East and thishas left us no choice but to supply almost all the heavy tanks for the JordanianBfl re-equipment programme as well as shouldering the main responsibility for thesupply of similar equipment to Israel, with all that that implies for our relations^L^LM with the Arab States. From what I saw during this short trip I would judge that,^L^L\ while there is little to complain of in the relationship between our representatives,,there still remains scope for a more equitable sharing of responsibilities in theBfl Middle East as between the United Kingdom and the United States.^L^LM I The area I visited is not the whole of the Middle East but it is the core of it,^LWm Cairo is the greatest centre of teaching and propaganda in the Arab world. Public^LWM opinion in Egypt may not mean much but this is the only country of the area^LWm where newspapers sell well over 100,000 copies daily.  The relics of Palestine andthe refugees represent a problem which unites the Arab world. The Palestine^LWM I upheaval has left the region somewhat in the condition of a volcanic crust whichM*M-\ has erupted and is slowly solidifying once more-but for how long?   It isimpossible to estimate what further volcanic potentialities the area holds. Thestatus quo, which we are concerned to preserve for fear of something worse,contains many anomalies.  Israel is the first and obvious one.  Whatever rapiaj^^fl affinities Israel may have with its Arab neighbours, its background and aspirationswMml are firmly Western and competent observers say that the Israelis are becoming lessand less like Jews every day. The division of Palestihe along geographical contour^L^LM lines has left many Arab villages gazing hopelessly down at the fields which theyused to cultivate, now beyond the frontier. Many Palestinian Arabs of high^^Lm intelligence and attainments have been pitchforked back from the advancedBJ administration of the British mandate into a feudal society headed by the Kingand his Bedouin advisers. (It is typical that the two examples of disinterestedpublic service by individuals which I saw in the area viz. Mr. Musa Nasr&apos;s Collegeat Bir Zeit and Mr. Musa Alami&apos;S farming community at Jericho, were both thework of Palestinians.) I heard nothing but loyal words in Jerusalem about Kingmjmm Hussein and his Government and I believe that the two parts of the country are^LWm settling down as well as could be expected. Nevertheless the mixture is anomalous.^LWM Geographically and historically &lt;the natural unit for Syria to join would be IraqI        and Transjordan: but Syria has joined Egypt, with no land connexion. And,M\^-\ however well things may be going for the moment, the union looks incongruous inthe longThere is thus very little that is solid in the area. The undeclared goodwill and^L^L\ acceptance of the status quo between Israel and Jordan js one of the few stableMwm elements. Meanwhile it is worth bearing in mind that, however much we may try^LWm and withdraw ourselves from Middle Eastern squabbles, the local Governments^LWm will continue to regard us as a useful card to play in the international game. Indeed^LWm our practical experience of the area makes our influence a tangible element in the1        situation which all sides will continue to canvass given the slightest encouragement.H To take only one example, Mr. Musa Alami argued to me that even now we and^LWm the Uniteq Slates should impose a Palestine settlement by which Israel would^LWM cede a strip of North Galilee to provide some compensation for evicted landownersMM CONFIDENTIAL^LM mm

He argues that we should be wrong inthinking that time will heal the wounds in Palestine since, both in Israel and the       i ^^flArab States, the young people are more fanatical than the old. Thus the beliefthat we can still make the weather in the Middle East dies hard: and no wonder inview of the influence we still exercise, almost against our will, in Jordan. IOne dominant impression which even a few days in the Middle East cannot^^H^sk,&quot;&apos;&apos; fail to provide is of the toughness of the Israelis and the ineffectiveness of the Arabs.The Egyptians and the Israelis are equally emotional in different ways but there Iis no doubt which is the more dangerous animal-the latter.  Indeed, I would besurprised if the Israel forces have many equals in quality among the world&apos;sconventional armies.   Our efforts to maintain a confidential relationship with JIsrael, while rebuilding a similar relationship with the U.A.R., are bound to befraught with complications.J. G. S.
