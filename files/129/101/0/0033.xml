Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1960C. (60) 83 Copy No.   3 312th May, 1960CABINETDOLLAR LIBERALISATIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 18th January the Cabinet discussed the further removal of import restrictions and they had in mind the liberalisation in late February or early Marchof imports of fresh and processed milk, dyestuffs, and canned fruit (other thangrapefruit and apples) (C.C. (60) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 8). Subsequently atthe meeting of the Economic Policy Committee on 24th February, I referred to theneed to proceed with the liberalisation of dyestuffs but to defer action on canned fruit until May. We should therefore now review what, if any, further action isnecessary particularly in relation to the dollar area and I would also like to seek the views of my colleagues as to what I should say on this subject during a visitI shall be paying to North America, including California and Western Canada,from 22nd May to 15th June.-2. I have annexed a list of the goods on which we are still exercising adiscriminatory control against the Dollar Area. The Americans and the Canadiansknow that in relation to most of these goods we have genuine problems and wecan therefore expect them to be reasonably tolerant of our continuing adiscriminatory control in breach of our obligations under the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). There is however one product, i.e., canned fruit,for which we have absolutely no justification for continuing our presentdiscrimination. Liberalisation of this product would not affect our balance ofpayments though it might, of course, cause some diversion of imports from commonwealth countries to the Dollar Area. The only effect of this control isto protect certain Commonwealth producers (particularly in South Africa, Australiaand to a lesser extent Malaya). &quot;These Commonwealth countries earlier pressedus to defer liberalisation until the autumn of this year but they have accepted thefact that we must remove the discrimination shortly and the Americans know thatthey have done so. This product is of great importance to the Americans and toa small extent the Canadians, and the United States Economic Minister in Londonrecently protested formally to me about our failure to liberalise it. So longtherefore as we retain control on this item we must expect the Americans and the canadians to be much more critical of our remaining discriminatory controls in breach of our GATT obligations.3. There are, however, strong reasons for deferring action. Although itshould not, in fact, affect our balance of payments, liberalisation might appearinappropriate at a time when we have had to take steps to restrain internal demand.Moreover a number of difficult issues have arisen in our relations with the americans. We have recently had cause for complaint about American shippingdiscrimination and about their support for the Six rather than the Seven in Europe.We are also about to re-negotiate the wool tariff quota but it will be some monthsyet before the outcome of this negotiation is known. On the whole the political reasons for deferring liberalisation seem to outweigh the advantages of action now.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
4. Of the remaining products we could liberalise wine, beer and gin at anytime. These are of minor commercial significance. Although the liberalisation of the imports of wine would have some presentational advantage particularly inCalifornia, these products must stand over until we can act on canned fruit.Pharmaceuticals cannot be further considered until July. The talks between theBritish and Dutch dairy producers which were intended to precede the liberalisation of. fresh and processed milk have not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion. Actionon. these other products must clearly be held up for a while yet.5. I do not think that this is the right moment to liberalise imports further.If my colleagues also take this view I would propose simply to say, during myAmerican and Canadian visit, that when we are in a position to make a further move towards liberalising imports canned fruit will be among the first of the products on which we shall act.6. There is a quota of  3-2 millions for imports of canned fruit from the dollar Area which runs from 1st September-31st August. For commercial reasons it is the practice to announce arrangements for the next season well in advance and I would propose that we should announce during June a small increase ofabout 15 per cent, in this quota for the next season. This would have administrativeadvantages and help us to meet some of the difficulties that inevitably arise in thedistribution of a quota based on past trade.R.
