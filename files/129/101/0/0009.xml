With about one-seventh of the funds I have to improve communications overan area one-half of that of England and Wales: we have about twice the mileageper head of trunk and classified roads and, while our traffic is lighter, our roads are on the whole of lower standard. Much of our industry is concentrated in central scotland but there are many parts where local industry suffers from the handicapof distance even from markets in Scotland: and the dispersal of industry will increase as the overspill problem in Glasgow is solved. The coming of firms likethe British Motor Corporation serving United Kingdom markets and the increasingdependence of all industry on access to larger markets illustrates the need for goodcommunications over the long distances in Scotland and of first-class roads to themain markets in the south. While, therefore, the main trunk road network in central scotland must be improved and urban congestion problems must be tackled, thereis a need for substantial expenditure on smaller schemes on the feeder routes.Proportionately, therefore, greater prominence must be given in Scotland to our programme of smaller schemes.Trunk Road Network3. At the present rate of expenditure it will take nearly ito 1980 to meet theminimum needs of the main trunk road network in Scotland. The appendix andthe map attached to this Paper show these minimum needs which I think shouldbe met within 10 years. Such a programme would provide for the improvementof about 700 out of 2,000 miles of trunk road in Scotland. The appendix alsoexplains how far the existing four-year programme, will take us.Urban Congestion4. The inner wards of Glasgow will be virtually rebuilt in the next 15 yearsand an inner ring road must be provided at the same time. This is expected torequire an average grant of up to  f million per annum for 10 years including theprovision of a central river bridge. Grants will also be needed-to enable Edinburghto proceed with substantial urban improvements.Tourist industry. The tourist industry is expanding rapidly in Scotland and in many partsis an economic necessity. Between 1954-59 the number of visitors accommodatedincreased from 3 - 7 millions to 5 millions; extended tours increased by 25 per cent,and car traffic on the ferries by 80 per cent.

the roads throughout the Highlands are not fit for it. There are, for example,lengths of road where the highway authority has had to preclude the use of the modern 8 ft. tourist coach and many others where they are not suitable. Theattached map shows three Highland trunk roads where widening to take twotraffic lanes is imperative.The Need for Advance Preparation6. Priority has been given to the Clyde Tunnels and the Forth Bridge, andI have been precluded from preparing trunk road schemes which could not befitted into the current four-year programme. A start must now be made on thepreparation of many large projects to be carried out before 1970; otherwise theScottish programme will not be sufficiently flexible to be adjusted according to the funds available from year to year.i&apos;!Long-Term Programme .7. The annual programme should be increased from the present level of 7 millions to  8 millions per annum to  20 millions per annum reaching that figure in 1963-64.Short-Term Programme8. More rapid progress should be made with the improvement of feederroutes (paragraph 2): this can be done by means of relatively inexpensive schemes which remove difficult and dangerous sections from long roads which are otherwise of fairly good standard for their purpose. In this category there are requests from my agent authorities and highway authorities for authority to proceed in 1960-61with smaller trunk road schemes costing  2 millions and with classified schemescosting  3^ millions in grant. At present no more than  9 millions can be allocated for each of these purposes and I propose that these sums should be doubled in1960-61 and be slightly larger still in 1961-62. In these two years we shall have toenter into the preparation of commitments necessary for the long-term expansionof the main trunk road programme.Annual Payments9. The annual authorisations I propose and the annual payments over thenext five years resulting from them would be as follows:	A uthorisations	Payments	  millions	  millions1960-61     ......	......      10	1131961-62     ......	......      13	12 11962-63     ......	......      18	13-61963-64 .......	20	14-31964-65	...      ...   . 20	17-0Total......	......      81	68-3After 1964-65 payments would become about  20 millions per annum if this rate of authorisation remains at the same level. Under the current programmemy expenditure over the five years 1960-65 would be about  50 millions.J. S M.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,25th March, 1960.
APPENDIXMASTER PLAN-Scotland a ten-year programme starting in 1960-61 and costing of the order of 165 millions is necessary to keep up with the increasing needs of traffic in Scotland,particularly to facilitate the movement of the produce of Scottish industry so as to overcome the handicap of distance from English markets and to open up thehighland area for the development of tourism.i2.

A programme of this size would enable 700 out of 2,000 miles of trunk roadin Scotland to be rebuilt; the priority routes in paragraph 2 (a) being opened to traffic by 1970-71; the Crofter Counties Programme would be completed by aboutthe same time. The general trunk road programme in paragraph 2 (b) would include reconstruction of many weak bridges throughout the country; it wouldalso enable the widening to take two lanes of traffic of over 70 miles of single-lanetrunk roads.Current Programme to 31st March, 19624. The four-year programme in Scotland has five main objectives; theirstate of progress at 31st March, 1962, and expected completion dates will be:Project(a) Clyde Tunnels(b) Forth Bridge(c) Glasgow-Stirling road a.80(d) Glasgow-Carlisle road a.74(e) Crofter Counties Pro-gramme   -StateNo. 1 completed; No. 2 half completed, to be completed by end of 1963.In progress, to be completed by end 1963.9 miles reconstructed; remaining 1\ in progress;completion date about end 1963.40 miles reconstructed or nearing completion; 17 underreconstruction; remaining 26 still to be authorised;completion about 1965-66.760 out of original 1,200 miles reconstructed or in hand;440 remaining.

Taken together these two priority lists cover 337 miles at  50-3 millions and together with schemes to be authorised before 31st March, 1962, make up thefigures given in paragraph 2 (a). The result of doing this work is shown on theattached map.March I960.
