confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1960C. (60) 51 Copy No.   g j15th March, I960CABINETBRAINWASHINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarThe Cabinet will no doubt have seen the rather sensational reports about&quot; brainwashing &quot; in the Press recently and, at the suggestion of the Prime Minister,I am circulating this paper to put the facts in perspective.2. There is confusion in the public mind between two entirely different things,&quot; brainwashing &quot; and training in resistance to interrogation. Brainwashing is a process whereby, to make a man recant his views or confess to an action, he isby psychological methods robbed of his previous personality and made ready toreceive the new personality which his captors wish to impose upon him. This is a process which takes months or even years and has a lasting effect on the individual.It has never been employed by the British Army or, so far as the War Office knows,by British Intelligence Services and there has never been any question of invitingvolunteers to submit to it for training purposes. The report of Professor Kennedy&apos;slecture in the Observer of 28th February, which started the publicity, was inaccurateand misleading. Professor Kennedy has written to me explaining that he made no reference to Britain in his lecture. I annex a copy of his letter. In last Sunday&apos;sissue the Observer made a very unconvincing attempt to justify its report.3. Resistance to interrogation on capture, which is a separate thing altogether,has always been a part of the Army&apos;s training. Formerly, when we were expectingto fight an enemy who would observe the rules of the Geneva Conventions,resistance to interrogation merely took the form of impressing on all ranks that,whatever the circumstances, the only information they were to give if captured in the field was their name, rank and number.4. The Army&apos;s experiences in the Korean War changed all this. In an effort to extract information from prisoners, the North Koreans and Chinese used manyforms of physical ill-treatment and torture. It is clear that this is the sort oftreatment which our soldiers, especially those of spearhead detachments, can expect to meet if we are ever again engaged in even limited hostilities with a communist Power.5. The Army has, therefore, in the last few years been acquainting soldiersof units such as the Parachute Regiment and Special Air Service, who areexceptionally prone to capture in war and likely to be in possession of muchinformation of immediate value to an enemy, with the sort of treatment that theymay expect to receive in such circumstances. Neither in intensity nor duration,of course, is the physical hardship comparable to that which a prisoner inCommunist hands would receive. The soldiers who undergo this type ofinterrogation are all volunteers. There have been no complaints about this typeof training nor requests for transfers or discharges on account of it.56714
War Office, S.W.1,14th March, 1960.annex copy of Letter from Professor Alexander Kennedy to the Secretary ofState for War 8th March, 1960Department of Psychological Medicine, 2 George Square,.University of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, 8.8th March, 1960:I understand that you would like confirmation of the information given byme to Colonel Bowring, who rang me up yesterday, about newspaper reports onthe subject of Brainwashing in Britain.I have looked at the script used by me at my discourse at the Royal Institutionand can give you full assurance that at no point in the script or in the discourseitself did I make any reference to Britain or to any sort of interrogation orbrainwashing activities carried out there. As there were about 400 people present it would not be difficult to obtain confirmation of this.My references to brainwashing were entirely general and no Government was referred to. My account of its principles could be deduced entirely from materialalready available in books and magazines. As I spent 4-  years in the Middle Eastduring the war it is unlikely that I would know anything about secret activities in britain. My paper was a scientific one which referred to the known methodsused in interrogation and their application to peacetime purposes such as thetreatment of Delirium in old age, to which a large part of the discourse was devoted.I was naturally annoyed when I saw the headline in the Observer, but Irealised that no good is ever done by complaining about inaccuracies in newspapers,so I took no action.I hope that this will serve to reassure you that my comments On brainwashingat the Royal Institution have been grossly distorted and exaggerated by the Press.Yours faithfully,(Signed)      ALEX. KENNEDY.The Right Hon. Christopher Soames, C.B.E.,The War Office,London, S.W. 1.6. On the whole, following my explanation in the House on 9th March, thePress has taken a very sensible line in distinction to the sensationalism of the daily Mails &quot; revelations &quot; on the previous day. I can assure the Cabinet thatthe Army is not doing anything which is discreditable or unreasonable.Interrogation of prisoners is in effect a weapon of war. Information thus receivedcan be vital in the winning of a battle. Resistance to the interrogation methods ofa potential enemy must, therefore, be an essential feature of the training of a soldier.C.
