oOn 17th May, I960, the Cabinet agreed that there should be nofurther relaxation of restrictions on dollar imports at that time and authorised the President of the Board of Trade to say during his visit to north America that canned fruit would be among the first of the products to be liberalised when we were in a position to take further action of thiskind (C. C. (60) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4).2.      The President of the Board of Trade has now proposed that import restrictions on canned fruit (excluding grapefruit and apples) should beremoved in the near future.   Imports of dollar wines, beer and gin, whichare of negligible commercial importance, would be freed at the same time.3.      The main reasons for putting forward this proposal are:-(a) We have no real justification for retaining import control on-canned fruit.   When this control has been removed, our ability to justify our remaining restrictions will be greatly strengthened.(b) The main centre of the canned fruit industry in the United states is in California.   The powerful Californian lobby is friendly towards theUnited Kingdom and has always been helpful in promoting liberal tradeprogrammes in the United States.   They have been patient towards our difficulties and it would be unwise to antagonise them by undue delay inremoving our import restrictions on their product.   In return we shouldsell greater quantities of British goods to the important Californianmarket and the canned fruit could provide cargoes for British ships atpresent returning empty from the United States.(c) In the opinion of the Board of Trade, there are reasons forthinking that the removal of restrictions on canned fruit would not resultin any significant increase in our import bill.   Consumption of canned fruit per head in this country is already well above pre-war levels, supplies are abundant, the stocks held by the Californian industry are not atpresent large, and it is probable that the dollar quota for the presentquota year will not be fully taken up, although this may be due partly tothe basis on which the licences have been issued.   Figures of importsof canned fruit from the dollar area, the Commonwealth and the restof the world for pre-war and for certain recent years are given in the annex to this paper.   If canned fruit were liberalised, there would nodoubt be some substitution of dollar imports for Commonwealth canned fruit, but Commonwealth goods would continue to enjoy a tariff preference of from 10 to 15 per cent.C.

(d)    Now is the right time to take this step.   The trade is expecting aGovernment announcement in early July about the arrangements for thenext quota year which begins on 1st September, I960.   An announcement of liberalisation on or before 15th July will enable the United States growersand canners to make their plans for the ensuing year.   It is unlikelythat there would be any marked increase in United States deliveries before1961.4.      The Economic Policy Committee have considered this proposal.Some members thought that the removal of restrictions would be likelyto increase our total imports of canned fruit substantially because of theattractiveness of the United States product and the probability that theUnited States exporters would launch an intensive campaign to promotetheir sales here.   Although the United States attitude in such matters asthe wool textile tariff and flag discrimination shows less regard toBritish interests than we would hope, the Committee recognised that theremoval of the restrictions on canned fruit would improve the prospects for our exports to the United States.   The Committee therefore recommendon balance that dollar import restrictions on canned fruit and on wine,beer and gin should be removed   as from 1st September, I960.   If this were done, it might be possible to obtain from the United States government an assurance that they would help us resist any pressure from theirdomestic producers for the removal of dollar import restrictions oncitrus prod.ucts, which are of basic economic importance to the West Indies.5.      The timing of an announcement causes some difficulty.   It might seem inconsistent to announce liberalisation in July, so soon after therecent measures to restrain internal demand and improve our balance ofpayments.    An alternative course would be to announce new quotas forthe next quota year and to announce the removal of controls later.However, the Government would be open to criticism if they announced in July new quotas and shortly afterwards removed the restrictions.It would be desirable to give at least one month1 s notice to the Common-wealth before liberalisation takes effect.   The President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were invitedto give further consideration before the Cabinet discussion to the timeof the announcement and have agreed that it should be made on or before15th July.   The Commonwealth Secretary has however reserved hisposition on this.recommendations.      The Economic Policy Committee recommend that:-(a) Import restrictions on canned fruit (other than grapefruit andapples) from dollar sources should be removed as from 1st September,I960.   Restrictions on dollar wines, beer and gin should be liftedat the same time.(b) The announcement should be made on 15th July. The commonwealth secretary has however reserved his position on this.7.    I seek the views of my colleagues on these recommendations.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.1st July, I960-2-
