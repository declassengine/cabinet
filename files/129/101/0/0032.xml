CABINETPICCADILLY CIRCUS:  MONICO  SITEMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh affairs my colleagues will recall our discussion on 26th November (C.C. (59) 60thConclusions, Minute 9) at which they endorsed my decision to call in the applicationwhich had been made to the London County Council for planning permission forthe redevelopment of a site on the north side of Piccadilly Circus.2. The proposal was for a building covering the whole site up to and includingthe first floor level, with a tower rising an additional 12 storeys. There were to be large panels for illuminated advertisements on the tower.3. A public inquiry was then held, at which.strong objection was expressed to the design by several architects of standing who were called by the Civic Trust.The London County Council and the Westminster City Council maintained thatthe design was satisfactory. Just before the inquiry opened the Royal Fine art commission declared themselves opposed to it but they did not appear.4. The Inspector agreed with the objectors; and for my part 1 have no doubtthat the application must be refused. The fundamental objections are that the design is poor: that the building would fail to give the sense of enclosure which an urban square or &quot; circus &quot; ought to have: and that the great advertising panelswould, in the Inspector^ words, &quot; hang over the Circus in a domineering manner &quot;,while the views of the upper part from a distance would be objectionable. a building of this kind would in my view ruin any chance of a satisfactoryredevelopment of the whole Circus. A further objection is that the proposed arrangements for car-parking are inadequate.5. To conclude that this building on this site will not do is easy. Thedifficulty comes in saying what is wanted instead. The developers are said tohave paid  4 millions for the site (including Moon&apos;s Garage, on which they reliedto meet their car-parking obligations) and they have already demolished muchof the property, relying on the fact that they had virtually reached agreement withthe London County Council as planning authority. It would therefore be extremelyhard not to give them some guidance as to what might be acceptable, Moreover,on getting the refusal they will be entitled to serve a purchase notice on theCouncil, requiring them to buy the site on the ground that the decision leavesthem with no &quot; reasonably beneficial use &quot;. If I were satisfied that that was so,I should have to confirm the notice within six months unless I was able to tell them that they could develop in some way which would give them &quot;reasonablybeneficial use &quot; even though it was not what they had wanted.6. I am advised that it would be possible, given some adjustment of theroad boundaries, to put on the site a longer, horizontal building which would givethe developers the same floor space, though less advertising space; and whichwould provide the sense of enclosure which is needed. The position is complicated57019Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1960C. (60) 82 Copy No.     **011th May, 1960
by the fact that the Minister of Transport desires there to be 50 per cent, morecapacity for traffic in the Circus when the London Pavilion comes down (which isproposed in 5 years&apos; time), but I understand that he has now decided how this canbe done, and that redevelopment of the Monico site with a long, horizontalbuilding can be fitted in..,5 7. But the big question is whether there ought not to be a comprehensiveIpltn for the complete redevelopment of the Circus as and when existing buildings are demolished, including a radical attack on the present jumble of vehicles andpedestrians, and possibly providing for their separation at different levels. the inspector said that the objectors in their various, ways were mostly advocatingradical treatment of the Circus, and he sympathised with that approach. Mightit be possible to provide shops on the first floor, with bridges over to an elevatedpiazza on the great central island which will be entailed in the new road plan?Ought the possibilities not at any rate to be examined?.8. I think they should. I propose, if the Cabinet agree, to say in my decisionletter that I intend to open discussions with the London County Council forthwithon ways and means of devising a comprehensive plan for the Circus to whichdevelopers can be asked to conform.9. That will still leave us with the question of the Monico site. The CountyCouncil do not feel able to face buying it, and the question will be whether it ispossible to settle the method of its redevelopment ahead of a comprehensive plan for the Circus without prejudicing that plan. My advisers think it might bepossible; but whether we could satisfy the developers must be doubtful. However,I think that on this we can only wait and see how things turn out; what arrangementswe can make for getting a comprehensive plan; and what line the Monicodevelopers take.10. Accordingly I ask the Cabinet to agree that I should turn down thebuilding proposed for the Monico site, explaining my reasons and saying that a building of horizontal emphasis on which the advertising panels would besubservient to the design instead of dominating it would be more appropriate;adding that I intend to discuss with the London County Council ways and meansof devising a comprehensive plan for the redevelopment of Piccadilly Circus towhich developers can be asked to conform.H.
