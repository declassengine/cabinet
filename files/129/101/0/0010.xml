All our experience since the war shows that a weak balance of payments is usuallythe reflection of an overloaded domestic economy. In present conditions of strongforeign demand the balance of trade is likely to benefit appreciably if we moderatethe growth of home demand.(c) Re-impose Physical Controls on Importsp Hardly any of the advanced industrial countries now resort to this device,which runs contrary to all the efforts that have been made in the post-war period to free world trade from quota and tariff restrictions. We have supported&apos; these efforts, particularly in Europe, in the belief that as a manufacturing nationdependent on a large flow of essential imports we stand to gain from an opensystem. The following difficulties would attend a re-imposition of import controls (i) The immediate effect would be a loss of reserves, owing to forestallingpurchases while the machinery was being built up, and to the shock to confidence in the pound.(ii) Unless control were extremely widespread, expenditure would be diverted from controlled to uncontrolled items.(iii) Unless control were accompanied by restriction of total demand,expenditure diverted from imports would fall on goods which could otherwise have been exported.(iv) If the restrictions were maintained for any length of time we should haveto expect retaliation from the countries whose exports we were cutting down. The reaction of the United States and Continental countries would be severe. It must be remembered that many of our exports are in the nature of luxury goods while the bulk of our imports are food and materials.(d) Limit Investment and Government Expenditure Abroad(i) Government Expenditure. The attached report on United KingdomExternal Investment shows that net Government expenditure overseas is expectedto average about  400 millions a year during the period 1960-63. This is some 120 millions more than in 1959. The main components of this expenditure arecontributions to overseas development ( 170-190 millions a year) and military expenditure (about  200 millions a year). It is difficult to produce any quickimprovement in either of these fields, but it is at the very least essential that weshould avoid entering into new commitments. We may well be driven to someunwelcome reductions.(ii) Private Investment Abroad. We could tighten our control over exportof private capital to countries outside the sterling area. But this consists mainly of profitable direct investment in oil and in Canada. It is, in fact, matched by an.inward flow of investment of about the same size. Portfolio investment is banned;credit facilities are tied to our exports. There has been no control over private investment in the sterling area and to impose such a control would risk the break-up of the sterling area.In considering the subject of investment abroad it is important to remember that a substantial proportion of it directly finances British exports, irrespective of whether the loans are tied or not. It also maintains commercial connexions ofbenefit to our trade. Hence a cut would bring much less than proportionate benefitto the balance of payments in the short run. In the longer run, of course, a cutwould mean the sacrifice of the profits on the investment.4. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the level of internal demand is the factor of crucial importance.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,25th March, I960.
ANNEX a balance OF PAYMENTS PROSPECTS AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENTMemorandum by Chairman of. the Economic Steering CommitteeThe Economic Steering Committee have discussed the following threeimportant papers, which are now submitted to Ministers, about the balance ofpayments prospects for 1960 and United Kingdom investment abroad:(a) Report by the Committee on Balance of Payments ProspectsThis report deals with the balance of payments outturn for 1959and reviews the prospect for the balance of payments during 1960.(b) Report by the Sub-Committee on United Kingdom External InvestmentThis report seeks to estimate the likely scale of United Kingdomexternal investment and expenditure in the period 1960-63.(c) Overseas Investment and the Balance of PaymentsThis is a general commentary by the Board of Trade.2. The following summary analyses the position as seen by the EconomicSteering Committee and gives their conclusions:(a) Unhappily both the present position and the outlook for the balance ofpayments give cause once more for serious concern.(b) So far as the balance of payments was concerned 1958 was an annusmirabilis. For the first time for a century, there was a surplus on thevisible trade account, and the combined surplus on current account(both visible and invisible) (nearly  350 millions) amply covered capitaloutgoings. As a consequence the reserves were fortified (by some 284 millions).(c) There was a marked deterioration during the course of 1959. The combinedsurplus on both visible and invisible account fell to  145 millions andfailed by a large margin to cover the capital outflow. The position was complicated by certain special capital transactions payment of thefurther subscription to the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.)( 232 millions), the repayment of the balance of the Export-ImportBank loan ( 89 millions) offset by a special receipt of  60 millions fromGermany.(d) The overall outcome was a deterioration in the monetary position by about 100 millions, setting aside the special capital transactions, and by 363 millions without this adjustment. (The reserves fell by 119 millions.) But the increased subscription to the I.M.F.strengthened our- second line of reserves and the repayment of theExport-Import Bank loan extinguished a liability which otherwise would have had to be met over a five-year period.(e) The disturbing feature of 1959 was the marked deterioration in the second half of the year, when the combined surplus on visible and invisibleaccount almost disappeared.(/) The main reasons for this deterioration were:(i) A disproportionate rise in imports as compared with exports(increase of imports of  275 millions as compared with 1958:increase of exports  119 millions).(ii) A sharp fall in the surplus on invisible account, due largely to a badyear for oil.(g) The forecast in the report is that there will be a further serious deterioration in 1960. The broad picture is expected to be that of a combined surplus on current account which will be only very slightly
higher than the disappointing and inadequate figure for 1959, andtherefore one which will be wholly insufficient to cover our increasedlong-term capital outflow. The main factors bringing about this positionare expected to be:(i) A slight worsening (1 per cent.) is assumed in the terms of trade.(ii) Although export prospects are good, imports are expected tocontinue to increase substantially (by some  370 millions overthe 1959 figure) and the deficit on visible trade is expected to bethe same as in 1959 ( 60 millions).(hi) There will be a slight improvement on the invisible account.(iv) The long-term capital outflow (excluding special transactions) isexpected to be nearly  80 millions higher than in 1959 (made up. as to  30 millions additional for inter-government loans, 20 millions additional oil investment, and  35 millions of long-term private investment, offset by a reduction of  5 millions inother kinds of investment).(/?) The general result is expected to be of a further deterioration in the monetary position to the amount of  200 millions as compared with 100 millions in 1959. A worrying feature of the position is that, forseasonal reasons, the whole fall in the reserves is likely to be concentrated in the second half of the year: if this happens, the effect on confidencecould be serious and the possibility of another autumn crisis could notbe excluded.(/) The forecasts have been worked out with great care. But they are obviouslysubject to much uncertainty in detail, and unforeseen movements(especially on the capital side of the account) could change the figuresappreciably. The crucial question is whether the broad assumptionsseem right. The general assumption has been that the economy will go on expanding in 1960 by about the same rate as in 1959. The maindoubt is whether the rate of continued stock building in 1960 has beenoverestimated. It is probable that a large part of the sharp increasein imports at the end of 1959 was accounted for by stock building: this process may come to an end sooner in 1960 than some of us anticipate,in which event the estimated substantial increase in imports might wellbe less. The most recent import figures however are still rising actually more rapidly than was allowed for in the forecast.(/&apos;) In general, the assumptions taken in the report are not felt to be toopessimistic. Indeed in some respects the opposite is the case: theassumption about the rate of increase in exports is very sanguine (alarger increase as compared with the previous year than in any yearsince 1951). And even if the assumption about stock building proved to be wrong and the import bill was less by, say,  100 millions thatwould still leave us with an overall deterioration in the monetary position for the second year running of  100 millions.(k) Fluctuations in the balance of payments are to be expected and need notnecessarily give rise to anxiety if the trend from year to year is satisfactory.  But the disturbing features of the present situation are:(i) The fact that the expected deterioration in 1960 will follow asimilar outcome in 1959.(ii) These difficulties are being experienced at a time when world conditions are very favourable for our trade (and the terms oftrade still satisfactory).(iii) We have to face a position in which, over the period 1960-63,Government expenditure overseas including loans is expectedto be some  120 millions a year more on average than in 1959.(iv) If there is a heavy fall in the reserves in 1960 (say of the order of 150 millions out of a total of  970 millions) this will not onlyweaken our general position but may shake the presentconfidence in sterling and so lead to even sharper deterioration in the position.
(/) Serious as the outlook is, the Economic Steering Committee do not considerthat it calls for the consideration of drastic steps such as, for example, there introduction of quantitative restrictions on imports or any attemptto control private investment overseas. Indeed such measures wouldbe likely to be self-defeating and to shake confidence. But the situation,in our view, points to the clear conclusion that the Government oughtto pursue a policy of caution and restraint as regards:(i) The scale of our future commitments (in military expenditure,aid, &amp;c.) overseas.(ii) The general pressure of internal demand on our resources in the months ahead. If this is excessive, it will increase imports andhold back exports. The situation could be transformed, forinstance, if over the year our exports could be increased by say,another 5 per cent. equivalent to  200 millions.3.

ANNEX BBALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROSPECTS FOR 1960PART I.-SUMMARYThis report deals with the prospects for the balance of payments during 1960.The main results are summarised in this part. A more detailed account of theoutturn for 1959 is given in Part II and the prospects for 1960 are outlined inPart III. The conclusions to be drawn are set out in Part IV.2.   The principal estimates are set out in the table below United Kingdom Balance of Payments, 1958-60  millions	1958	1959	1960		Provisional	ForecastBalance of visible trade      .........	-f 98	- 58	- 60Invisible balance      ...      .........	+251	4-203	4-220Identified current balance   .........	4-349	4-145	4-160Special capital transactions^)       ......	 	-261	-Other identified long-term capital (net)   ...	- 259	-287	-365Balancing item        ............	4-123	4- 40	-Monetary Movements (adverse -f)	-213	4-363	4-205Monetary Movements, excluding effect of special transactions     .........	-213	4-102	4-205(*) I.M.F. subscription (-232), Ex-Im Bank repayment (-89) and advance repayments of debt and purchase of Treasury Bond by Germany (4-60).3. In 1959 there was a deterioration in the United Kingdom&apos;s monetary position (that is the balance of liquid assets and liabilities) of about  360 millions.However, there were some large special transactions, such as the I.M.F. subscription,which can properly be excluded in assessing the underlying position in 1959. If thisis done, the overall deficit is reduced to about  100 millions. In 1960 the overalldeficit is forecast at over  200 millions.4.   This prospect is clearly unsatisfactory and calls for remedial action.PART II.-THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN 19595. No more than preliminary figures for some sections of the balance ofpayments in the final months of 1959 are yet known, but the central fact seems certain. There was an underlying overall deficit in the balance of payments of theorder of  100 millions. The actual deficit was over  350 millions but there werespecial non-recurrent transactions^ which can properly be excluded from the reckoning.6. In 1958 there was an overall surplus of a little over  200 millions. A large part of the adverse movement between 1958 and 1959 lies in the estimate for thecurrent balance which worsened by  204 millions. However, this change, togetherwith a small increase in the identified net outflow of long-term capital, fails to account for over  80 millions of the deterioration in the external monetary positionbetween 1958 and 1959 and the balancing item reflecting errors and omissions hasmoved from -r- 123 millions to -f- 40 millions.7. There was little change between 1958 and 1959 in average import and export prices with import prices about 5 per cent, below and export prices about per cent, above the average for the previous five years. Thus it is changes in the* Set out in the footnote to the table above.SECRET56776 d
volume of trade which have dominated the visible trade position. On a seasonallycorrected basis imports and exports began to rise in 1958 and by the fourth quarterof 1959 both imports and exports were rising strongly, imports rather the more; itseems probable that a large part of the spurt in imports at the end of 1959 wasaccounted for by stockpiling. As a result, imports on a balance of payments basiswere valued  275 millions higher than in 1958 at  3,605 millions, and exports 119 millions higher at  3,547 millions.8. The net credit on invisible transactions also moved adversely in 1959 by 50 millions, mainly on account of a fall in the net oil credit. There area number of factors responsible for the reduction in the net oil credit.First, the figures for the two years are not strictly comparable due to the change in treatment of the United States special resident accounts at the end of 1958.Secondly, operating expenses rose in 1959 with the rising trend of production.Thirdly, remitted proceeds fell in 1959 with a more competitive supply position which led to a fall in posted prices of crude oil, sales of large amounts of oil at considerable discount, and increased supply credits.9. The long-term capital account in 1959 included three special transactions:the payment of the  232 millions further subscription to the International monetary fund, the repayment of  89 millions to the United States Ex-Im Bank, and thereceipt of  60 millions from Germany on account of advance repayments of debt and purchase of the Treasury Bond. As a result of the first transaction, the second lineof reserves has been greatly strengthened and the second has extinguished a liabilitywhich would have otherwise had to be met over the next five years.10. The special transactions apart, there was a small increase of  28 millions in the net outflow of long-term capital between 1958 and 1959, but within the totalthere were more significant changes. Inter-Government loans (net) increased by 44 millions to  89 millions and the net outflow on account of oil investmentincreased by  67 millions, largely because there was a much smaller inflow than in1958 when the Royal Dutch issue brought in  50 millions. On the other hand,there was a fall of  76 millions in the &quot; other &quot; long-term net investment mainlyowing to the unusually high level in early 1959 of the inward flow of private capitalfrom the United States.11. In sum, 1959 was a year when the United Kingdom identified currentsurplus, one of  145 millions, failed by a large margin to meet the identified long-term capital outflow of  287 millions (excluding the special transactions). The favourablecontribution to the overall position from unidentified transactions was much smaller than in previous years, and the change in the external monetary position amountedto about  100 millions, excluding the special transactions.12. Had these transactions not taken place, and the repayment of  71 millions to the I.M.F. (which reduced the reserves and sterling liabilities equally) not beenmade, the net change in the external monetary position would have been composed as follows a net increase in liabilities of  17 millions on account of miscellaneouscapital, &amp;c, an increase of  184 millions in the Rest of the Sterling Area (R.S.A.)sterling holdings, little change in the Non-Sterling Area (N.S.A.) sterling holdings and an increase of about  100 millions in the reserves. The actual monetarymovements included an increase of  43 millions in N.SA- sterling holdings and a fall of  119 millions in the reserves; the other monetary items were not affectedby the special transactions.PART III.-THE PROSPECTS FOR 1960The Economic background.3. Last year was a year of continued recovery from the recession of 1958, and1960 seems certain to be a year of further world economic expansion. Moreover,prosperous conditions are likely to be more widespread. During the greater part of1959 the exports of primary producing countries were rising, but their importsremained low. Now, following increased export earnings and relaxation of import controls, their imports have also started to rise and should contribute significantly tothe expansion of world trade in the coming year. This should present new opportunities for United Kingdom exports.
14. In the United States and in other industrial countries a further expansionseems certain in 1960 though perhaps generally at a slightly lower rate than in1959. A continued large outflow of gold and dollars from the United States ofsome $2^ billions is expected, though this would be less than in 1959. Apart fromthe United States, no other important country seems likely to be in a balance ofpayments position which might lead to any significant restrictive action. Indeed,a large aggregate increase of reserves seems likely to accrue to some western european countries, notably Germany, France and Italy. We do not expect thatany steps taken by the United States authorities to reduce their overall deficit willhave any important repercussions on the United Kingdom in 1960.15. Trends in the United Kingdom internal economy will be more thanusually critical for the balance of payments prospects in 1960. Our forecasts are based on the expectation that the economy will expand in 1960 at a rate not very different to that of 1959, and that demand will press more closely than at present on the nation&apos;s capacity to produce. Hence the supply position of exports isexpected to be less favourable than in the last two years.The United Kingdom Balance of Payments16. We expect the overall balance of payments position in 1960 to moveadversely by about  100 millions compared to the outturn for 1959 (excluding fromthe reckoning the special transactions which took place last year). The current account surplus is put at  160 millions with the visible deficit about the same as in1959 and the net invisible surplus rising by nearly  20 millions. The net long-term capital outflow is expected to increase by nearly  80 millions.17. With expanding economies at home and overseas, large rises in bothimports and exports and some resumption in the upward movement of pricesseems certain over the coming year. However, it is impossible to quantify thesetrends with a precision sufficient to be confident of a reliable forecast of the visibletrade balance, for the visible balance is extremely sensitive to comparatively smallchanges in import and export trends. We consider our estimates lie at the centre of what is possible and we indicate in succeeding passages where the main doubtslie.Imports18. Imports rose strongly in the last quarter of 1959. The available evidencepoints to there having been a large build-up of stocks in the economy towards theend of 1959 and this has undoubtedly influenced the level of imports. A slightly lower rate of stock-building is expected in 1960 than in the fourth quarter of 1959though higher than in 1959 as a whole. We therefore expect the rate of increase ofimports to slacken in the course of the year.19. Total imports (valued f.o.b.) in 1960 are forecast at  370 millions, or about 10 per cent, above the level of 1959. An increase in volume of importsaccounts for roughly 7 per cent, and the remaining 3 per cent, is on account of price. Most of the expansion is expected in imports of industrial materials and finished manufactures. It has been assumed that the volume of imports of industrial materials (which here includes all imported goods used in the first instance in industry, for example, metals as well as ores and yarn and cloth as well as textilefibres) will increase by 8 per cent, compared with the expected rise in industrial production of some 7 per cent, and higher prices seem likely to account for anadditional rise of about the same magnitude. The total rise in imports of industrial materials is put at  240 millions. In 1959 imports of finished manufactures thatis types of goods going into final consumption or investment increased sharply,under the influence of trade liberalisation and the boom in consumer durables.In 1960 the effect of liberalisation continues, and a faster growth is expected in demand for capital goods. On the other hand there is likely to be some slackeningin the rate of growth of demand for consumer durables, and British manufacturersshould have more chance of maintaining their share of the home market. For1960 we have forecast an increase in imports of finished manufactures of 160 millions, or 35 per cent. Some  45 millions of this represents Boeing 707aircraft for B.O.A.C.; excluding ships and aircraft the increase would be much thesame as in 1959.    On a proportionate basis the rate of expansion of finished
manufactures is considerably larger than the improvement in exports of this category although in absolute terms the export rise is the greater. The Committeewill give further study to this point.Exports20. Exports also were rising strongly towards the end of last year and 1960clearly presents great opportunity for further expansion. Not only is thereincreasing world demand but also the imports of the United Kingdom&apos;s maincustomers, the R.S.A. countries, are now picking up firmly after a rather sluggishperiod in 1959. In assessing the level of exports in the coming year it has been necessary to take into account the effect of likely developments in the UnitedKingdom internal economy. We have taken the view that rising pressure of home demand during the year will have a slight adverse effect on export performance,e.g., by lengthening delivery dates.21. An increase of 8 per cent, in the volume of exports is forecast for 1960which is greater than for any year since 1951 but this represents a falling off in therate of increase experienced in the latter part of 1959. The rise in export earnings in 1960, including a price increase of some 2 per cent., is put at  368 millions (in balance of payments terms) or a little over 10 per cent, higher than in 1959. R.S.A.countries are expected to take the same share of exports in 1960 as in 1959.Exports to Western Europe are expected to increase at a higher rate than in 1959but the rise in exports to North America may slacken off with less buoyancy inmotor car exports and an end to the indirect benefits of the American steel strike.The Balance of Visible Trade22. These import and export trends in 1960 lead to a forecast deficit in thebalance of visible trade of  60 millions, about the same as the deficit provisionallyestimated for 1959. The volume of exports is expected to rise a little more thanthat of imports but this favourable movement is offset by an assumed smalldeterioration in the terms of trade. In our forecasts for the trend in import and, export prices, the terms of trade deterioration has been put at about 1 per cent.However, any forecast of price movements in international trade is at any timehazardous and it is particularly so in the circumstances of an expanding world economy. An unforeseen price trend could materially upset the prospects for thevisible balance set out in this Report.Invisibles23. The net surplus on invisible account is expected to improve by nearly 20 millions. The net oil credit is expected to rise by  73 millions on account of higher remitted proceeds and reinvested profits. On the other hand Governmentnet debits are put over  20 millions higher with military expenditure responsible forthe greater part of the increase owing to a fall in German contributions to supportcosts.Long-term Capital24. The net long-term capital outflow in 1960 is put at the very high levelof  365 millions, nearly  80 millions above the outflow (apart from specialtransactions) in 1959. The steady upward trend in new Government lending seems certain to continue and for 1960 expenditure is forecast to be  82 millions ( 49millions in 1959*), almost entirely for India and the Colonial territories. Theestimate for net oil investment, at  136.millions, is nearly  20 millions higher thanin 1959. The net outflow of other identified long-term private investment of nearly* This figure forms only part of the total financial assistance by the United Kingdom to the less-developed countries set out in Cmnd. 974. The other main items of financial assistance are colonial and other grants of  50 millions (included in the current account of the balance of payments) anddisbursements by the International Bank of nearly  20 millions (reflected in an equivalent fall in theBank&apos;s sterling holdings). In all, the financial assistance items in the balance of payments estimates for the calendar year 1959 of this Report aggregate about  125 millions which is comparable to thefigure of  138 millions for the financial year 1959-60 in the White Paper.  10 millions of the differencebetween these two figures reflects the estimated increase in Government overseas loans in the first quarter of 1960 compared with those made in the first quarter of 1959. The remainder of the difference( 3 millions) represents transactions which do not enter the balance of payments.
 90 millions^ is higher than the 1959 estimate by  35 millions but the 1959 figure was low as a result of an unusually high level of inward flow of capital from theUnited States into the United Kingdom.The External Monetary Position25. Bringing the figures for current and long-term capital account together,we forecast a current account surplus in 1960 of  160 millions and a long-term capital outflow of  365 millions. The balancing item has somewhat arbitrarilybeen put at zero for it is impossible to forecast this item with any confidence.Thus our estimates imply a deterioration in the monetary position of a little over 200 millions.26. It remains to consider how this is likely to be distributed among theUnited Kingdom monetary liabilities and assets. Some movements are predictable.The known transactions on miscellaneous capital account imply a net inflow of 30 millions which represents an increase in net liabilities in the monetary position.Another and more important monetary item is the movement in the sterling holdings of the R.S.A. countries. This change reflects the overall position of theirbalance of payments with the rest of the world. In 1959, when the low level ofR.S.A. imports continued to reflect the effect of both the restrictions imposed in1958 and the reduced export incomes of the recession period, the R.S.A. sterling holdings rose by  184 millions. R.S.A. imports have started to rise and, with higher export incomes and a high level of development spending, the expansionshould be well maintained in 1960. Exports are also expected to rise but byrather less. Thus, with little change in the inflow of long-term capital, the sterling holdings of the R.S.A. are likely to rise substantially less than in 1959. After a detailed study of the R.S.A. position we put the increase at  110 millions.27. Of the forecast of a little over  200 millions deterioration in the monetary position in 1960, we have so far accounted for  140 millions as an increase inliabilities, mainly to the R.S.A. How the remaining  60 millions should be distributed between changes in the N.S.A. sterling holdings and in the reservesis impossible to judge as much depends on unpredictable short-term capital flows.However it is possible to set down some special factors affecting the level ofN.S.A. sterling holdings. These include the repayment of  60 millions of theI.M.F. drawing, which will have the effect of reducing the sterling liabilities and reserves equally, and the payment of  24 millions compensation by Egypt. these and other known factors would lead to a fall in N.S.A. sterling holdings of over 100 millions in 1960. If there were no other movements in the N.S.A. sterling holdings, the reserves would fall by over  160 millions. This would be likely totake the form of a rise in the reserves during the first half of this year and a fallin the second half of the year rather larger than  160 millions. But it is quite possible that the foreseeable changes in N.S.A. sterling holdings will be outweighed by other movements, so that the change in reserves could well be less or morethan the figure mentioned above.PART IV.-CONCLUSIONS28. The forecasts set out above have been worked out with great care andin much greater detail than is shown in this Report. Nevertheless it must be stressed that they should not be taken literally. With the volume of exports and importsrising fast and with prices also in movement, no forecast of the balance betweenthe two can be relied on for accuracy. Each 1 per cent, error in volume of imports,volume of exports, the price of imports or the price of exports alters the outturnby  40 million from the forecast. Nor is it at all easy to forecast the balance of very large transactions on both sides of the oil account; while unforeseen capital movements are constantly occurring, and the balancing item, representingunidentified transactions, is subject to considerable fluctuation.29. While the particular forecasts made above are not to be trusted implicitly,we feel confident of our main conclusion that the overall balance of payments willon present policies be rather worse in 1960 than in 1959.30. In judging whether a given balance of payments situation or prospect is acceptable or not, this Committee has for many years been guided by the standardthat the external monetary position of the United Kingdom is weaker than is
desirable and needs to be improved over the long run. At the same time it is obviousthat fluctuations in the balance of payments are normal and inevitable and shouldnot give rise to concern, provided the trend over the years is satisfactory.31. Looking back, 1958 was exceptionally favourable from a balance ofpayments point of view by reason of the sharp fall in import prices and thedepression in home demand which limited the volume of imports. In 1959 activity in the United Kingdom revived, and imports rose, partly on account of somestock-building; but the revival in some of our export markets, particularly inside the Sterling Area, was delayed. Viewing the two years together, therefore, it is not surprising that some worsening of the balance of trade took place in 1959.32. In 1960 we are assuming some rise in import prices and a continuation of stock-building at a rather higher rate than in 1959 as a whole, and so the totalimport bill is put at about 10 per cent, higher than last year. Export earnings areexpected to increase at a similar rate and the total current account surplus isexpected to be little different to that of 1959. On the capital side of the account,however, the deficit is expected to increase by  80 millions. Thus it comes about that in what may be regarded as a favourable year, the overall deficit, instead ofdecreasing, will increase. This goes contrary to our aim of maintaining a surplus in the overall balance of payments over an average of years so as to improve the external monetary position in the long run.33. Part of the United Kingdom overall deficit is likely to be financed by arise in the sterling balances of the other members of the sterling area. Whileincreases in these holdings may lead to losses of United Kingdom gold andconvertible currency reserves later, and represent a potential lien on the UnitedKingdom&apos;s future export capacity, at least this is better than financing a deficit outof reserves in the first place. There are, however, certain specific reductions inthe sterling holdings of the non-sterling world in prospect, so that despite the helpwe shall be getting from the rest of the sterling area a fall in reserves in 1960 is highly probable. We would not wish to forecast the amount of this fall in any definite way, partly because of the general uncertainties mentioned in paragraph 28above and partly because there is a considerable chance of some inflow of fundsinto London arising from the liquid condition of the world economy in 1960,based fundamentally on the continuing outflow of gold and dollars from the UnitedStates.34. In the Committee&apos;s last Report (November 1959), it was stated that &quot; the recovery in the United Kingdom has not been going long and there are few signsof pressure in the domestic economy. Up to the present the balance of paymentshas been satisfactory. Hence it would be premature to advise taking in sail. Thepresent is the time for vigilance &quot;. Since then the results for the second half of1959 have become available and have shown that the United Kingdom was inoverall deficit in 1959. The further worsening between 1959 and 1960, indicatedas probable in the last Report, is confirmed by the present review. On this occasion, therefore, the Committee conclude that the prospect is unsatisfactory and requires to be altered by remedial measures.35. It is not the function of this Committee to make recommendations oneconomic policy as a whole. But it is clear that we shall be running serious dangerson the external front unless positive steps are taken to improve the balance ofpayments: by limiting the rate of growth of domestic demand; by caution in face of the inevitably increasing pressure to accept commitments for higher Governmentlending abroad; and by maintaining domestic monetary conditions which will tendto moderate private lending abroad, espcially in the field of short-term credit.36. We cannot predict exactly how much improvement in the external positionwould result from a given set of measures. But we are confident that resolute action could bring about a substantial improvement in the balance of payments and that,in any event, it is of cardinal importance that we should leave the world in no doubtthat we have our domestic situation firmly under control.

ANNEX CECONOMIC STEERING COMMITTEESUB-COMMITTEE ON UNITED KINGDOM EXTERNAL INVESTMENTREPORT ON UNITED KINGDOM EXTERNAL INVESTMENT 1960-63Introduction and Summary of conclusions the Sub-Committee was set up in July 1958 with the following terms ofreference: &quot; To keep under review the United Kingdom&apos;s external investmentwith particular reference to the resources available and the demands made upon them, and to make regular reports to the Economic Steering Committee &quot;. Thisis the Sub-Committee&apos;s second report; it covers the period 1960 to 1963 andincorporates provisional estimates for 1959 produced by the Balance of PaymentsProspects Committee.conclusions.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows:  I. For the years 1960 to 1963 net Government expenditure overseas isexpected to be on the average about  400 millions a year. This is some 120 millions a year more than in 1959. There are three main reasonsfor the increase:  (a) Government grants and loans for development are expected to be some  40 millions a year higher. The main single componentis aid to India.(b) Net military expenditure abroad is expected to be, on the average, 20 millions a year higher. This is mainly because of the ending of German support costs.(c) The remaining increase of  60 millions results from a larger excessin the future of payments over receipts on account of pastGovernment lending and borrowing operations. Receipts wereexceptionally high in 1959, especially from Germany.II. 1959 was a year in which, even when certain exceptional Governmentpayments are disregarded, the external monetary position showedsome deterioration!1). Given the expected increase in government expenditure overseas in the years 1960 to 1963 the other componentsof the balance of payments would need to improve by more than the anticipated rise in net Government expenditure abroad if the externalmonetary position is not to deteriorate further.III. It is not possible to forecast with confidence the development of thesecomponents over a number of years, but the Report attempts to assess the likely trend, with the following results:  (a) No help can be expected on the private investment side. private investment overseas is likely to rise although a considerable partof the increase is likely to be met by reinvesting increasedoverseas profits.(*) The 1959 total excludes the Ex-Im Bank repayment as a transaction more properly belongingto the external monetary position in that the reserves and a medium-term liability were equallyreduced; it also excludes the sterling portion of the United Kingdom&apos;s subscription to the international monetary Fund.SECRET56776 E
(b) Apart from this element of reinvested profits the net invisible balance is not likely to show much change.(c) Thus, if any improvement is to be found it must be through a reversal of the small deficit on the visible trade balance that weexperienced in 1959. We cannot count on such an improvement.In recent years the United Kingdom&apos;s share of world trade hasbeen falling and we can find no positive reasons for predictinga change in this trend. In the absence of such a change, wecannot expect to do better than achieve a rate of rise in exportsabout the same as the probable expansion in our imports. Inaddition it is likely that there will be some deterioration in theterms of trade.(d) We take this view on the assumption and in the belief that the world economic background will be favourable. The growth of world trade should not be hampered by liquidity problems in the period under review. The problem of the disequilibrium in the UnitedStates balance of payments is likely to continue for a time,but we do not envisage that this will lead to corrective measureswhich will present serious difficulties for the rest of the world.IV. The prospect is, therefore, that on present policies net government expenditure overseas will rise, but there is likely to be no correspondingimprovement in the other components of the balance of payments.These conclusions suggest that the external monetary position willworsen by several hundreds of millions of pounds over the next fouryears. This worsening would be more likely to take the form of a lossof reserves than of an increase in liabilities. Since the present level of reserves is lower than is desirable, a further loss of several hundreds ofmillions of pounds could not be tolerated.V. The conclusion to which we are led is that the various objectives of policy that involve competing claims on our balance of payments may provedifficult to reconcile; choices between desirable aims may have tobe made.3. This Report is in a different form from the Sub-Committee&apos;s first Report(E.S. (59) 9). In this Report we concentrate on Government transactions (bothcurrent and capital) in the balance of payments, and deal in a more summary formwith the other components. This Report also examines some additional problemsconcerned with international lending which were not covered in the first Report,but the background analysis contained in the first Report is not repeated.4. The Report is in three parts. The first part examines in detail Governmenttransactions in the balance of payments and gives some quantitative forecasts forthe years 1960 to 1963. The second part looks at the remainder of the balance ofpayments and considers in turn the outlook for private investment and the current balance, and the implications for the external monetary position. The third partexamines two general questions associated with the subject of this Report, i.e.,world liquidity and the need for flexibility in the United Kingdonrs capitalcommitments.PART government TRANSACTIONS IN THE BALANCE OF payments the Scope of Government Expenditure Overseas5. In the review of probable developments in the United Kingdom externalcapital account over the years 1960 to 1962, made in the Sub-Committee&apos;s first report, one of the conclusions to emerge was that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be under heavy pressure to increase its lending overseas throughout thisperiod. The circumstances calling for such increased lending, particularly to the under-developed countries of the Commonwealth, were recognised at the MontrealConference in 1958. In this report we have attempted to look a little further ahead,to the end of 1963, and the re-examination of the prospect confirms that over the
next four years new Government lending is likely to show a sharp increase on thelevel of lending expected in 1959 and to be well above all recent years.6. Net Government payments also include the Government^ current spendingoverseas and in order to assess the total external claims made by the Governmenton resources, account must be taken of these items which are part of the netinvisible balance in the current account of the balance of payments. Governmentcurrent expenditure in the. next four years may also show some increase. For theyears 1960 to 1963 Government net expenditure overseas as a whole is expected tobe on the average about  400 millions a year. When the exceptional Ex-Im Bankrepayment in 1959 is excluded this is some  120 millions more than in 1959.7. Proposals to increase overseas expenditure whether in the form of militaryoutlay, grants or loans, have to be viewed against the background of competing claims, not only on our external resources but on total national resources, andmeasured against proposals to increase Government spending at home or toreduce taxes. In order to keep the scope of its enquiry within bounds and toavoid overlapping the work of other bodies, the Sub-Committee has not pursuedthe domestic implications of overseas expenditure. The resultant claims on domestic resources and on the Budget nevertheless need to be taken into account in considering the scale of overseas expenditure. For the purposes of this report it has been assumed, however, that domestic policies will be such as to ensure thatthere will be a sufficient margin of resources available to provide for likely increases in exports, and that the only limiting factors will be the availability of export markets and the relative competitiveness of United Kingdom exports.8. The Sub-Committee has used as the basis for its survey estimatessubmitted by Overseas Departments of the probable demands on the Governmentfor lending abroad in the next four years; estimates have also been made ofGovernment current expenditure overseas, including grants. These estimates are intended to show the probable magnitude of the demands that may be made on united Kingdom resources; some are commitments and some prospective newrequirements. The adoption of figures for the purposes of this Report does not,of course, bind either the Overseas Departments or the Treasury in any policycontext. With this reservation the Sub-Committee has accepted the estimates (witha few amendments made in the light of discussion).9. In the presentation of the detailed review of Government overseas spendingwhich now follows, it is convenient to distinguish between Government spendingfor development and the remainder of Government overseas spending. this method enables the main elements in the expected increases to be brought out.The estimates are presented on a balance of payments basis, and not on anappropriations financial year basis as is used in the proposed White Paper on government overseas aid.10. Table 1 below summarises the estimates of spending for development,the estimates being explained in the succeeding paragraphs 11 to 18.New Lending: Current Commitments11. In the years 1955 to 1958 new lending, excluding Colonial development corporation loans, averaged about  20 millions a year; in that periodCommonwealth countries received only half this sum most of the remainder went to Iran and other Middle East States, but the period also included a  20 millionscredit given to Argentina. There was a large increase in new lending in 1959,mainly to India and the Colonial Territories. In the next four years loans already promised are expected to run at about  30 millions a year; the main recipient willbe the Colonial Territories; but the estimates also include the Nigerian loan and theremainder of the loans offered to India under the consortium arrangements, whichare expected to be fully drawn by 1961.New Lending: Probable Requirements12. New Government lending, however, is likely to be required on a large scale. The United Kingdom almost certainly will need to finance a proportionof India&apos;s development needs in the last year or so of the Second Five-year plan as well as in the the Third Five-year Plan on a scale at least comparable with the loans made during the two consortium operations. The eventual size of the UnitedKingdom share will be determined no doubt after international discussion but for

Loans to other Commonwealth countries, apart from India, may totalabout  18 millions a year, with Pakistan, Ghana, Malaya and Nigeria the most likely recipients. In addition Government funds lent through the colonial development Corporation may continue at some  5 millions a year in the forecastperiod. For new loans to non-Commonwealth countries (mainly to countries in southern Europe and the Middle East) we have taken a figure of  6 millions a year.14. In total, therefore, the scale of probable new requirements for UnitedKingdom Government lending is put at  55-75 millions a year, which, taken withthe commitments already undertaken, suggests a total of newlending of  100 millions a year on average. Such a level of Government lending would be far above the levelincurred in any year since 3948 the period of post-war reconstruction in Europe.Grants15. A further contribution to development is made through government grants. These grants cover a wide variety of purposes; they range from emergencyaid to Malaya to grants for the provision of technical assistance, and include UnitedKingdom subscriptions and contributions to United Nations agencies and the colombo Plan. The Colonial territories are again the largest recipients; Colonialgrants are primarily for development and welfare purposes, but they also comprisegrants-in-aid of local revenues as well as help towards local emergency costs. Butthere are also a number of small grants made to independent commonwealth countries as well as non-Commonwealth countries; Malaya has been a big recipientand, on a smaller scale, some of the Middle East countries.Table 1
16. In the four years under review grants to the Colonies are expected tocontinue at about  40 millions a year. Grants to Commonwealth countries areexpected to show some increase although the period should include a reductionin payments to Malaya. Among the grants to foreign countries where some increase is also forecast, grants to international organisations are expected to show anincrease in trend, and the special grants to particular countries seem likely tocontinue at least for some part of the forecast period. Thus, development grantsas a whole may average about  60 millions a year in 1960 to 1963.Capital Contributions to International Organisations17. The use of United Kingdom capital contributions to various international organisations for development purposes should also be included within the totalof the Governments contribution to development abroad. In 1960 to 1963 drawingson the United Kingdom contribution to the European Fund under the EuropeanMonetary Agreement are expected to be about  5 millions a year. The UnitedKingdom is likely to contribute to the proposed new International development association at a rate of about  10 millions a year over the four-year period. Inaddition the International Bank is expected to spend the rest of the sterling it nowholds; the remainder of the original United Kingdom subscription will probablybe drawn by the end of 1961 and this would give, over the four-year period, anaverage of  3 millions a year. The International Bank may seek to replenish thesefunds by a further issue in London but this would be private money and is, therefore,excluded from this section.18. Further United Kingdom contributions may also come through overseas governments&apos; issues on the London Market but these fall outside the Governmentsphere and are dealt with separately below. Thus, to sum up these estimates, thetotal United Kingdom Government contribution to development in 1960 to 1963is expected to average  170-190 millions a year according to the size of our eventualfurther contributions to Indian development.Other Government Transactions in the Balance of Payments19. The United Kingdom Government contribution to overseas developmentcovers only a part of the total of Government transactions in the balance ofpayments. There are large loan repayments in both directions and Governmentcurrent expenditure of a kind not associated with development. Estimates forthese items are given in Table 2 and discussed in paragraphs 20 to 25.Table united Kingdom Government transactions in the Balance of Payments (&apos;)  millions	1955-57 average	1958	1959	1960-63 averageTotal United Kingdom Government con-tribution to development (from Table 1) New borrowing by United Kingdom: German bond deposit   ......

New Borrowing20. No new long-term borrowing by the United Kingdom is expected in theyears 1960 to .1963. The estimates show a receipt of  37 millions in 1959 fromGermany which is more in the nature of an accounting operation; sterlingdeposited in the United Kingdom by Germany against future repayments of theGerman post-war debt to this country was transferred from the sterling balancesinto a long-term bond. The bond will be reduced as repayments become due.Repayments: to the United Kingdom21. Repayments to the United Kingdom which were exceptionally highin 1959 because of especially large receipts from Germany and Holland should beabout  25 millions a year in the four-year period under review. These repaymentsare largely from European countries in respect of post-war loans and will be mainlypaid off towards the end of the present period.Repayments: by the United Kingdom22. Repayments by the United Kingdom in 1960 to 1963 are likely to averageunder  60 millions a year. In addition to the United States and Canadian loans now some  30 millions a year repayments on the debt to E.P.U. will be about 30 millions in 1960, but will fall off in the later years of the period. There are alsosmall repayments due to Portugal. The estimates of repayments exclude the UnitedKingdom&apos;s obligations to the I.M.F.; in the next two years we are due to repurchase 120 millions in respect of our 1956 drawing. This item is treated as a short-term capital transaction and affects only the components of the external monetary position.Military Expenditure23. The forecasts of United Kingdom military expenditure abroad (basedmainly on information provided by the Service Departments) at nearly  200 millions a year in 1960 to 1963, are some  20 millions above the levels which prevailed in1958 and in 1959. The increase is largely because of the expected ending of Germansupport costs.Administrative, Diplomatic, &amp;c.24. This covers a wide variety of expenditure. The total has risen in mostpast years, but is expected to be maintained at about current levels in the next fouryears some  40 millions a year.Government Credits25. In the period 1955 to 1957 the United Kingdom Government^ invisiblereceipts averaged  100 millions a year of which about a third was defence aid fromthe United States and rather more than a third arose from off-shore sales to theUnited States Government. In 1958 defence aid ceased and receipts from other united States sources fell so that total receipts in that year were less than 60 millions; in 1959 receipts fell to about  45 millions. Receipts as a whole areexpected to show a further slight decline in the next four years mainly because ofa fall in off-shore sales. In making this assumption we have taken no account ofany change in United States military spending overseas, which if it occurs is likelyto be in a downward direction, and would further reduce United KingdomGovernment receipts in respect of United States spending on military installations and provision for United States forces.Net Government Transactions26. The net overseas transactions of the Government in the past two years have resulted in sharply increased demands on United Kingdom resources. In1959 there was a particularly sharp increase in Government spending on development, but the effect of this was offset by exceptionally high receipts,particularly from Germany. It is expected that in the next four years netGovernment transactions will cost something like  400 millions a year on average.27. This gives an increase of about  120 millions on 1959. There are three main reasons for the increase. Government grants and loans for development areexpected to be some  40 millions a year higher. Net military expenditure abroad is
expected to be, on the average,  20 millions a year higher. The remaining 60 millions is largely accounted for by a rise in net outgoings in respect of UnitedKingdom borrowing and lending in the past; this mainly arises because the exceptionally high level of receipts in 1959, including the German bond operation,will not be repeated in 1960 to 1963. The fall in these receipts will more than offset the benefit of some decline in our own repayments. Quite arbitrarily we retain thespecial German transactions for the purposes of comparison; this is partly because in any year there are usually some exceptional items, and it is difficult to decide what should be excluded and what retained, and partly because quite fortuitously thetotal of the German transactions was offset in its effect on the external monetary position by the gold payments to the International Monetary Fund in respect of theincrease in quotas. The rise in Government spending on development containedwithin the expected increase implies that in the next four years we are likely toacquire long-term assets in so far as the main increase is expected in Governmentlending rather than grants. While these assets should lead to some increase in ourinvisible receipts, repayments are likely to be spread over a long period, and in somecases refinancing or the turning of the loan into an outright grant may proveinevitable.28. Throughout this Report prospective Government payments are calculated as an annual average over the years 1960 to 1963. This is because of thedifficulty of dividing the averages for 1960 to 1963 into separate figures for individual years. It does seem, however, that 1960 is likely to be a particularly heavyyear in respect of Government overseas payments. In this year a high level ofpayments is expected to the European Monetary Fund; the remainder of our 18 percent, subscription to the International Bank is likely to be run out; and the yearmay include the first drawing on our contribution to the International development association. With regard to the remaining years of the forecast period no one yearseems likely to be conspicuously better or worse than any other.PART IITHE REST OF THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS29. The argument so far can be summarised as follows. Our. examinationof the Government account has led us to conclude that provision must be madeunder existing policies for substantial increases in development lending and ofmilitary expenditure above the 1959 level. The amount of the increase in netGovernment expenditure abroad cannot be precisely estimated but (ignoring theEx-Im Bank repayment in 1959) it looks like being in the region of  120-140millions. This increase is expected by comparison with a year when the externalmonetary position even allowing for a number of exceptional transactions andthe fact that the full figures are not yet complete probably showed a significantalthough not a serious deterioration.30. What we have to consider now. is whether we can be.reasonably confident that, under these circumstances, the other components of the balance of payments will improve enough to cover the additional Government outlay, and still leaveroom for some strengthening of the external monetary position. The improvementrequired in these other components might be something of the order of 200 millions.Overseas Private Investment31. We consider first the outlook for overseas private investment. This typeof investment includes borrowing by overseas Governments on the London Marketas well as normal direct and portfolio investment by United Kingdom residentsin enterprises overseas. Private investment also makes a contribution to overseas development, but being associated primarily with potential profitability it is of a rather different calibre from Government lending.32. The net level of overseas investment is determined by many varyingfactors on which it is virtually impossible to make realistic assumptions. overseas investment both outward and inward can be affected by off-setting factors in thecurrent account, while these movements tend to fluctuate from one year to anotherdue to exceptional transactions which cannot be foreseen.
c33. In our last report we examined private capital transactions in some detail and attempted to forecast their probable development over the three years 1960to 1962. With the difficulties described in the preceding paragraph in mind,however, the Sub-Committee considered that there was little value in repeating this procedure. Instead, in this section, we consider whether the probable developments in private long-term capital transactions over the next few years are likely toaccentuate the problems created by the prospective rise in Government spendingand the need to strengthen the external monetary position.Outlook for Private Overseas Investment 1960 to 196334. Generally, we would expect the level of net private investment in the next four years to rise well above net private investment in the past few years. Themain increase is likely to be in oil investment which has been rising steadily forsome time and seems likely to go on doing so. In so far as this increase will be financed out of re-invested profits it should produce no additional burden on thebalance of payments.35. The course of other overseas private investment is more difficult to envisage. With investment opportunities growing in the more developedCommonwealth countries it may be expected that direct investment will resumean upward trend in the next four years unless a new recession intervenes or thereis a significant change in financial conditions in this country. The common market may also provide an attractive field for United Kingdom investors. As inthe case of oil, part of this investment will no doubt be financed out of re-investedprofits, but some of the increase is likely to lead to an actual outflow of funds.This assessment assumes no major change in exchange control policy.36. The level of overseas Government borrowing on the London Marketwill be governed by the trading conditions of the period, but the incidence of these loans will probably be spread fairly evenly over the four-year period, although loansmay show a sharp increase should trading conditions deteriorate in a particularyear.37. Inward investment in this country will no doubt be affected by the sort of exceptional transactions that occurred in past years, but as it is quite impossibleto anticipate such transactions we can only assume that inward investment willcontinue at something like a &quot; normal &quot; rate.38. Thus, to sum up this section, the probability is that net investment as awhole will be well above the level of past years. A substantial part of the increase will be made out of re-invested profits and so will be offset in the current account.But some proportion of net private investment does entail a call on UnitedKingdom resources, although no reliable estimates can be put on the amount involved. Any change in the resulting outflow of funds is likely to be in an upwarddirection and will add, therefore, to the additional burden expected on government account.Invisible Balance39. There are three large items here Government expenditure, shipping,and interest profits and dividends. An increase in Government overseas spendingon current account has already been allowed for in the section on Governmentspending. With regard to shipping, liner rates tend to remain stable and the volumeof tramp shipping available makes any substantial recovery in tramp freightsunlikely. The shipping accounts as a whole therefore should show little change.There is a strong upward trend in interest and profits from United Kingdomoverseas investments, and this is likely to continue. But this increase may be largely offset by increases in private investment overseas. We have no reason to expect any systematic change in either direction in the aggregate of a large numberof other smaller items entering into the invisible balance. In short, we cannot rely on an improvement in the invisible balance to carry the extra burden on the external position to be expected from Government transactions.The Balance of Visible TradeImports40. The rate of growth in the volume of United Kingdom imports tends tobe very much in line with the growth of industrial production. We see no reason
to change the hypothesis of our last report of an average annual increase in industrial production of about A\ per cent., which implies a rate of growth in thevolume of imports of about 5 per cent, a year. .Exports41. As in 1959 we had a slight deficit on visible trade, export earnings would need to grow slightly faster than imports if the balance of payments wasnot to be adversely affected by this increased expenditure on imports. Assuming,as we have done throughout the report, that domestic policies will be such as toensure that there will be sufficient margin of resources available to provide the requisite exports, the expansion of United Kingdom exports will depend on world conditions and on our competitive power. The outlook for world exports of manufactures in the next four years will depend on the rate of expansion in industrial countries and, in so far as this is reflected in demand for raw materials and foodstuffs, on the income of primary producing countries. The imports of primary producing countries will also be affected by their success in continuing toobtain overseas supplies of capital and by their attitude to the size of reserves they wish to hold.42. Broadly, the prospects seem favourable for a continued expansion in world trade. Expansion in industrial countries is well under way, and there seemsevery prospect of substantial growth over the period under review. Primaryproducing countries should benefit from the recovery in their earnings from their main exports. The risk of liquidity problems has become less with the recentstrengthening of the International Monetary Fund, and with the recent improvementin the distribution of world reserves. A doubtful factor in the situation is thecontinued disequilibrium in the United States balance of payments; no firmconclusion can be reached about this problem but it is referred to more fully inPart III. The rate of international lending is another doubtful factor. Anyassumption about the rate of growth of world trade must attempt to take all these and other factors into account. Generally, we think that a rate of expansion of8 per cent, seems a reasonable guess at the average annual increase in world exportsof manufactures over the next four years. This is less than the 10 per cent, annual increase from 1953 to 1957, but this was a period of marked economic expansion.43. In the period 1953 to 1957 however United Kingdom exports increased on the average by less than 5 per cent, a year. No satisfactory explanation can begiven for the failure of United Kingdom exports to rise as fast as the average. Inpart it was due to the composition of our exports and the areas to which we normallysell. The market for many of our traditional exports was not expanding, and insome instances was declining. (However, a significant change in the composition of our exports has been achieved; in 1938 engineering products accounted for20 per cent, of the total, in 1958 the engineering share was 44 per cent.) our traditional markets in the sterling Commonwealth, which still account for over two-fifths of our total exports, have been expanding at a slower and more irregularrate than world trade as a whole. In addition, a notable feature of the period hasbeen the recovery of Germany and Japan; with these two countries regaining ashare of world trade some loss in our own share was probably inevitable. other reasons have been examined in the Board of Trade and other Departments but thedecline remains partially unexplained.44. During the period of contracting world trade in 1958, United kingdom exports almost maintained their share of world trade in manufactures, but with therenewed expansion of trade in 1959 the United Kingdom&apos;s share resumed the downward drift. Since we do not know why this downward trend has persisted in the past we have no basis for assuming that it will be reversed in the future.While the sterling Commonwealth is now recovering from the 1958 recession, itseems unlikely that the expansion in the demand for imports will be as rapid andas steady as in the more highly industrialised countries. It may well be that weshall also lose some ground in Commonwealth markets to foreign competitors;apart from the general trend towards the ending of quota discrimination, theUnited Kingdom market is not growing so fast as other markets (our agricultural policy is a contributory factor), and this has led many Commonwealth countries to attempt to broaden the basis of their trade and to revise tariff preferences. in western Europe the effect of the development of the Common Market may mean that the expansion of our exports there may be at a slower rate than those of countries within the community.SECRET56776 f
45. We can see no reason, therefore, to expect that the downward trend ofthe United Kingdom share of total world trade will be reversed. With a growth of that total by 8 per cent, a year, we should be doing markedly better than wehave done hitherto if our exports expanded at a rate of 5 per cent, a year or at about the same rate as our imports were increasing. An increase of this orderimplies a proportionately greater expansion of engineering exports, which havebeen the main element in the growth of exports over recent years.46. These assumptions imply that there is little likelihood of an improvementin the balance of visible trade over the 1959 level without taking into accountpossible changes in the terms of trade. In fact some deterioration in the terms oftrade seems likely although the extent of the deterioration cannot be foreseen; asan example, a 1 per cent, deterioration in any given year would cost  40 millions in that and subsequent years though some of this might eventually be recoupedby an increase in the volume of exports.47. To sum up this part of the Report so far it is difficult to find reasons,either in the private capital account or in the current balance, which are likelyto produce much change in the next four years compared with the results achieved in 1959. If anything, with private investment likely to rise and with the termsof trade liable to turn against us, these transactions together may add to the deterioration expected on Government account. This is not to say that animprovement, particularly in the current items could not happen, but rather thatwe do not think it likely.External Monetary Position in 1960 to 196348. There will thus be substantial extra demands compared with 1959 on theUnited Kingdom&apos;s foreign exchange resources, and we cannot count on meetingthese demands by increased net earnings. In addition since the monetary position for 1959 deteriorated!3), this means that the outlook for 1960-63 is that the monetary position will continue to deteriorate even before the extra Governmentdemands are taken into account.49. Thus, taking into account the 1959 position and the expected increasein Government overseas spending we reach a conclusion of a possible annualdeterioration of perhaps  200 millions a year. In view of the wide margin of uncertainty over many of the components in the calculation, that figure shouldnot, however, be read as a definite forecast, but rather as an indication of the strong probability that there will be some deterioration unless appropriate action is taken to prevent it. It is scarcely possible to give any useful guess at the formthe deterioration may take i.e., increase in liabilities or a fall in reserves. However,the indications are that on balance there will be little change in total sterling holdings over the period as a whole, and this implies that the deterioration wouldbe in the form of a reduction in reserves.50. For a swing in the monetary position of this size to be sustained even for two consecutive years would imply a much larger change in the external monetary position than at any time since the war, with the exception of 1951 when UnitedKingdom imports rose by more than  1,000 millions over the previous year. Inany case given the size of our reserves it is apparent that an annual deterioration of this size could not be allowed to continue for four years, although a deteriorationon this annual scale might properly be accommodated in any one year throughdrawing on our second line of reserves in the International Monetary Fund.51. We have emphasised throughout the difficulty of making judgments inthis field. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests very strongly that there is aninconsistency between policy objectives on the one hand, the Government^declared intention to increase its overseas lending and, on the other, the need to improve the external monetary position. How to resolve this inconsistency isa matter for further policy consideration.C1) This is after excluding the Ex-Im Bank repayment and the sterling subscription to the I.M.F.Without this exclusion the deterioration was particularly severe. The Ex-Im Bank repayment is excluded from the long-term capital items on the grounds that it led to an equal reduction of gold reserves and in medium-term liabilities leaving the true external monetary position unchanged. , the sterling subscription is excluded on the grounds that the existing sterling holdings of the Fund are so high that the additional sterling subscription is not likely to be called for some time.
PART IIITWO GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS(i) World Liquidity52. The outlook for world liquidity has improved considerably with the redistribution of world reserves that has taken place over the last few years andthe increase in the resources of the International Monetary Fund. The improveddistribution of world reserves has been largely based on the outflow of gold and dollars from the United States which has continued throughout almost the wholeof 1959. Attention has been focused on the United States gold and dollar outflowin the last two years because of the exceptionally high level of the outflow, andit is generally accepted that the disequilibrium in the United States balance ofpayments, which the size of this outflow signifies, is not likely to be allowed tocontinue indefinitely. Because of the outflow the rest of the world has also beenable to absorb the rapid build-up of German reserves without undue strain.53. A doubt for the future is, therefore, the measures that the United states authorities may take to restore a better balance in their external payments.Generally, we do not think that any drastic remedial action is likely to be takenin the immediate future. The outflow is in any case likely to fall well below the1958 and 1959 level in the immediate future through some improvement in theUnited States trade balance following the moves towards non-discrimination andthe recovery in economic activity in the rest of the world and for other reasons.It is possible that the volume of United States aid might be reduced in later yearsand further moves towards the tying of United States aid might follow; UnitedStates military spending overseas might also be reduced. But in our view drastic changes in United States policy seem unlikely, at least in the four-year period under review, and we would expect the United States authorities to rely mainly onan expansion of earnings in order to achieve a measure of equilibrium.54. On the assumption that the outflow is reduced, or perhaps reversed atsome stage, the rest of the world will need to accommodate itself to a rate of growth of reserves below the rate at which world trade is expected to grow. This itself in the long-term might produce pressures in the world payments system which couldhamper the continued expansion of world trade, particularly if the Germandisequilibrium is not corrected at the same time as that of the United States. here again although we think the danger should be recognised, we think it reasonable toassume that the international action on the necessary scale is likely to be taken inorder to prevent the world payments system from suffering any major disruptionfrom these causes. Indeed, countries are already taking measures towards a fullerco-operation as is shown by the recent increase in I.M.F. quotas.(ii) Scope for Flexibility in Lending55. The assessment in this Report emphasises the importance of retaining asmuch flexibility as possible in Government lending policies, so as to allowappropriate retrenchment of United Kingdom lending if sterling should come under strain. (The point was made in the Sub-Committee&apos;s first Report, Part IV,paragraph 70 (12).)56. It must be recognised however that the scope for flexibility is severelylimited by commitments and arrangements entered into in the past. Even wherea loan is not actually promised we may find ourselves morally committed becauseof the pattern of past aid. In the case of expenditure under the colonial development and Welfare Acts, to take another example, the promised UnitedKingdom funds are often committed to long-term development schemes which arehardly subject to short-term curtailment.57. The need for flexibility should nevertheless be borne in mind, not onlyin the context of the terms of particular loans but also in the timing of new loans.The disbursement of funds, arising out of a loan agreement, may spread over along period during which the balance of payments can move from a favourable toa weak position.

.    ANNEX DOVERSEAS INVESTMENT AND THE BALANCE OF payments memorandum by the Board of trade the Economic Steering Committee, in their discussion of the Report on united Kingdom External Investment, agreed that further consideration shouldbe given to the possibilities of improving the balance of payments and that these should be examined when the Balance of Payments Report was before theCommittee.2. The position seems to be that we can no longer make ends meet. We are committed by policy decisions to overseas capital expenditure in the form of aid and investment and we have no prospect in 1960 of attaining a sufficient balanceout of income to finance it. Since we got out of our worst difficulties on the balanceof payments in 1957, there has been a sharp increase in overseas aid and investment,beyond the level which could be supported by a current surplus of the ordernormally achieved. Now we find ourselves short of money to meet our commitments.3. If overseas aid and investment are to continue on the scale forecast in thepaper, the only alternative to drawing on the reserves or borrowing is to improve the current balance. Assuming that Government military expenditure overseas isirreducible, there is little or nothing the Government can do to influence the invisibleaccount short, perhaps, of improving tourist facilities here or restricting our own people&apos;s travel abroad. Any significant change in the current balance can only beachieved either by increasing exports or by reducing imports.4. The ordinary machinery for encouraging exports is working steadily andthe Minister of State, Board of Trade, has recommended to the Economic PolicyCommittee some measures to improve the effectiveness of those efforts. No onesupposes, however, that these recommendations will result in an early and substantial increase in our exports. There are, in fact, as experience has proved,no administrative devices which will of themselves bring about any noticeableacceleration of the level of our exports.5. Increased export credits might, in some circumstances, result in someincreases in our exports, although not necessarily an improvement in our balanceof payments. If the economy is already fully employed, to provide yet more loanswould merely increase the deficit on current account by providing on credit goods for which we can earn cash. If, however, credits could be used to secure export orders for under-employed firms, then they might reduce the deficit and would notadd to it; they would increase our exports, but not necessarily and immediatelyour export earnings. But the effect on the balance of payments would depend on whether and when the money was repaid, and particularly on the extent to whichearly repayments more than covered the import content, and on how far theunemployed resources might otherwise have been switched to firms whose productssave imports or produce extra cash-earning exports.6. Imports can more readily be influenced by direct controls, but this is notthe same thing as saying that this results in an improvement in the balance ofpayments. The economy is now wide open with practically no controls on imports,and increased demand at home would suck in more industrial materials and finished goods. Import controls have not for many years been an effective barrieragainst this. To reduce imports by quantitative restrictions would do harm ratherthan good. Such restrictions would have to be non-discriminatory and imposed on Commonwealth and foreign imports alike. They might reduce the total bill,but most of the recent increase in imports has been to meet the needs of industryand to cut these would reduce industrial output. The internal effects would beinflationary and affect our competitive position in exports markets. In any case,the restrictions would certainly produce prompt and vigorous retaliation,particularly in Europe; all the more so as our purpose in introducing them wouldnot be to combat a current account deficit, but in order to continue overseas aid and investment at a level of our own choosing. In the long run we should be likelyto lose at least as much on exports as we saved on imports.
7. If our aim is to secure an improvement in our balance of payments, weare therefore forced to consider appropriate internal measures. It is assumed thatsharp deflationary measures would not be tolerable or tolerated because of theireffects on employment and output. The effects would in any case be uncertain:while severe deflation would certainly reduce imports sharply, it might not increaseexports substantially. A mild deflationary policy, if sustained over a period, wouldbe unlikely to produce any substantial increase in exports beyond what we havealready forecast, but it would make the achievement of those forecasts and possiblysome improvement much more certain. Such a policy might also be expected to moderate, the demand for imports. The converse of this is, of course, a continuanceof an inflationary trend. This would increase the demand for imports and leadmanufacturers to seek export business less actively and to be less competitive in price and delivery, so that our exports would certainly fall below the level forecastand the balance of payments position deteriorate further.8. To sum up, there is no way to remedy overspending except to reduce expenditure. The country cannot afford to lend, spend or give away more than itsreceipts from overseas. While the Government could by appropriate internalpolicies increase the current account surplus, we shall only land ourselves in troubleif we over-lend and then hope that somehow or other we shall be able to step up our income. A large surplus on current account is only attainable with a high levelof real savings within the economy. This can be attained by the appropriatemonetary or budgetary measures. But it means either the Government, or industry,or the consuming public must cut down their demands on resources. This wouldbe reflected in increased resources for exports and a reduced demand for imports,and therefore a larger current surplus.Board of Trade, S.W.1,March 1960.
