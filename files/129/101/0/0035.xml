H SECRET -II_HJ ancBuia 23/V*  * f &lt;w JDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^|   I       C. (60) 85 COPY NO.24th May, 1960CABINETINDONESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsOn Wednesday, 13th April, the Defence Committee discussed thesupply of ships and aircraft for Indonesia.    The Committee:-(a) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the ParliamentarySecretary, Ministry of Aviation, to arrange for negotiationsto take place for the sale to Indonesia of small patrolvessels and of eight unarmed Shackleton aircraft. ^Lmm(b) Took note that the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence, ^LwmWaWawM would obtain the views of the Australian Government on thesupply of destroyers to Indonesia.In reaching these decisions Ministers were influenced both by commercial ^LfM-mWM con siderations and by the views of the Chiefs of Staff that it has becomeof the utmost importance for the Western Powers to meet the require-ments of the Indonesian armed forces in order to prevent their becomingdependent upon the Communist bloc.    There was a particular danger ofthe Indonesian Navy coming under Communist domination.2. During the recent visit of the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies,to London, the Prime Minister discussed this problem&apos;with him and learntthat the Australian Government would not intervene to prevent us supply-ing eight Shackleton aircraft and two destroyers to the Indonesians.3. In the last two weeks new circumstances have arisen bearingupon this matter.    Indonesian reactions to the much publicised Dutchdecision to send an aircraft carrier, destroyers and permanent militaryreinforcements to New Guinea   have become increasingly violent, forI example the deplorable attack on the Dutch diplomatic office in Djakarta.We have learnt from secret sources that they have even been talking ofattacking the Dutch warships should they enter what the Indonesiansclaim to be their territorial waters.    There is undoubtedly muchexaggeration in all this, but the Indonesians are excitable people who mayact foolishly in the heat of the moment.    There is considerable inter-national disquiet about the situation and, during the Meeting ofI A Commonwealth Prime Ministers, the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru,emphasised the dangers of this state of affairs.    In such circumstancesa decision at this moment to sell important weapons to the Indonesianswhich could undoubtedly be used for aggressive purposes might be heldm\\\\ m\mm\
SECRET ^^^^Bto be provocative.    The Dutch are still trying to help over Sixes and i  Sevens and the effect upon them of such a decision at this moment couldcould be very bad.    I think, therefore, that we should postpone adecision for the time being.4.     I should like to be able to take some other form of action toimprove our relations with the Indonesians;    At the moment we havelittle commercial trade with Indonesia.    This is largely because wediscriminate against Indonesia in the matter of export credits. Shereceives only three years cover, as in the case of defaulters such asTurkey and Uruguay, instead of the usual five years, although in fact,surprising  as it may seem, she has been a good risk up to now. Webelieve that we could obtain valuable contracts which would assist in theindustrialisation of Indonesia and open important markets to ourselves ifthis could be extended to five years.    I feel that whether or not it isdecided to supply aircraft and destroyers to Indonesia, it is verydesirable that we should establish more normal commercial relationswith them.Foreign Office, S.W.I.24th May,Hit H
