THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROEERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)REPLACEMENT OF THE &quot;QUEEN&quot; LINERS;CHANDOS report memorandum by the Paymaster-general on 29th July, 1959, the Cabinet gave consideration to the replace-ment of the Cunard Liners - the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;(C. C. (59) 48th Conclusions, Minute l).   As recommended by the Ministerof Transport, the Cabinet approved the appointment of a small independent committee whose function would be advise the Government - on theassumption that the &quot;Queen&quot; liners would be replaced - on such questions as the type of ship best suited for the purpose, how it should be built and operated and how this should be financed. There was general agreement tothe effect that the Government intended to support our traditional supremacyin the weekly trans-Atlantic service through the replacement of the&quot;Queen&quot; liners when this became necessary.   This intention was published in September, 1959, in the Conservative Party manifesto which stated:&quot;We   .... intend to support the replacement of the &quot;Queen&quot; liners&quot;.2.      The committee were appointed on 11th September, 1959, withViscount Chandos as chairman;   the other members beingSir John Hobhouse and Sir Thomas Robson.   They issued their reporttowards the end of May, I960, and the conclusions were reported to theHouse of Commons on 1st June, I960.3. The committee were not asked whether a replacement should bemade and interpreted their terms of reference to mean that they should recommend how best an express passenger service across the Atlanticunder the British flag could be maintained. They considered their taskto be to make recommendations which would, if possible, be such as to induce the Cunard Company to operate the service and to invest a largeproportion of their available funds in the replacement of the present &quot;QueensThe Chandos recommendations.      Their conclusions have been agreed with the Cunard Company andare as follows.5.      The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; should be replaced by a ship of a gross tonnageof 75,000 tons.   A decision as to the replacement of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;would be postponed until 1968 to take into account developments in sea andair travel across the Atlantic and in nuclear propulsion.C(60) 901st July, I960CABINET-1
6.      The financial arrangements should be as follows -(a) The agreement to be subject to a capital cost not exceeding 30 millions.(b) The ship to be owned and operated by the Cunard Company through a separate company to which the Cunard Company would subscribe 12 millions as equity capital.   The remainder of the cost, not exceeding 18 millions, to be provided by the Government as loan capital.Alternatively, the ship to be owned and/or operated by the Cunard Companyso long as the Government were left in the same position as regardssecurity and redemption as if the ship were owned by a separate Company.(c) The loan to bear interest at 4j per cent per annum from the date on which the ship comes into service.(d) The loan to be redeemed by the operation of a 4jr per cent sinkingfund over twenty-five years.(e) If the gross yield on the Cunard equity should exceed an averageof 7 per cent, the excess to go to accelerate redemption of the Governmentloan.(f) The Cunard Company to have the right to redeem the outstandingbalance at par at any time on reasonable notice.(g) Depreciation to be at a rate of one-twenty-fifth of the capital cost per annum.(h) On the assumption that the ship is owned by a separate subsidiarycompany, the Government to have a charge on all assets and earnings ofthe company,   including accumulated depreciation funds.   The use of depreciation funds to be subject to the approval of the Government.Equivalent arrangements to be made if the ship is not owned by a separatecompany.(i) The construction of the ship to be put out to open competitivetender to all appropriate shipyards.(j)     The loan to be interest-free during the construction period,except that any Government money drawn in the first two years of thatperiod to bear interest at Z\ per cent for the remainder of the period.(k)    If, from the  beginning of the sixth year of service, the grossyield on Cunard&apos;s investment should fall below 3 per cent in any calendar year, then for each one-half per cent fall the interest on the Governmentloan to be reduced by one-half per cent for that calendar year.Consideration by Ministers7.      The Sub-Committee of the Economic Policy Committee on shipping and Shipbuilding have considered these proposals.   They have directed their attention in particular to the element of subsidy in the recommendations,the extent to which the terms might be improved, the effect which a subsidy might have on shipping policies and other Government loans, the contribution which the proposed ship might make to our earnings of foreign currency and the productive resources for which its building would provide employment.-2-
Element of subsidy in recommendations.      The Chandos proposals involve the Government in considerable financial assistance to the Cunard Company even if the service of the loanis fully met.   Before the rise in Bank Rate the rate at which theGovernment could have raised a similar loan repayable over twenty-fiveyears was about 5f per cent.   The interest rate of 4^ per cent payable by the company would, therefore, have been tantamount to a subsidy inthe region of  4 millions.   This loss to the Government would be increasedby about  lj millions by the provision that advances during the constructionperiod should bear no interest or, in certain circumstances, a rate ofZ\ per cent.   In fact, the value of the Governments assistance is greaterthan  5j millions because the company would probably have to pay interest at 6-f- per cent on a comparable loan in the market, if it were possible toraise a loan at all for a project with such an uncertain financial futuredue to increasing air competition.   And it is even greater now that interest rates have risen or can be expected to rise following the change in bank rate.9.      There is the possibility of further loss to the Exchequer arisingout of the proposal that the rate of interest of 4j per cent should be reducedpro rata to any reduction in the gross yield on Cunard&apos;s investment in the equity capital below 3 per cent in any year.10.    There is also the risk that the separate company will be unable to repay the Government&apos;s loan. The scheme recommended by the ChandosCommittee provides that, at the end of ten years, two-thirds of theGovernment&apos;s loan would be covered by repayments or by cash assetson which the Government would have a charge, while at the end of the fifteenth year the loan would be fully covered.   But if the venture were unsuccessful and the depreciation and loan service charges during thefirst fifteen years were not fully met, the Governments capital would beat risk since the assets of the separate company would not provide fullsecurity for the loan.11.     There is also an element of subsidy in the arrangements for insurance.     Cunard&apos;s estimates provide for insurance to cover only their share of the cost of the ship.   If the Government had to bear the cost Ofthe insurance on their own investment, or decided to carry the risk them-selves, there would be a concealed subsidy to the company of about 67,000 a year, or rather more than  rf- millions in all.   The cunard company paid for insurance to cover the existing &quot;Queens&quot; on a whollycommercial basis.Co uld the se term sjbe ipn proved ?12.    It is very unlikely that the Cunard Company would agreed to payable higher rate of interest than 4j per cent on the Governments loan.   Theywould argue that their main competitors on the North Atlantic route havereceived considerable Governmental assistance towards the constructionof their ships, including a subsidised   rate of interest, and at least one ofthem continues to receive an operating subsidy.   The United StatesGovernment contributed.  16 millions to the total cost of  27.7 millions ofthe &quot;United States&quot; and agreed to advance up to 75 per cent of the remainingcost at 3-^ per cent interest.   The French Government provided  5 millionstowards the cost of the &quot;France&quot; and undertook to pay any interest over-3-CONFIDE confidential 
4j per cent while the liner was under construction.   The Dutch Governmenthave also provided a loan at 4j per cent to the owners of the &quot;Rotterdam&quot;.It seems clear that a higher rate of interest could not be negotiated withthe Cunard Company.    They might of course consider it if the Governmentwere first to refuse publicly to go ahead on the lines of the Chandos Report.13.    Some of the other conditions might be open to renegotiation.   Thereis already a provision that if the gross yield on the Cunard equity exceedsan average of 7 per cent, the excess should be used to accelerate re-payment of the Government loan.   It would be useful to have provisionsthat, if Cunard&apos;s return were to exceed an average of 7 per cent:-(a) Some interest should be paid on the loan during the constructionperiod.(b) The rate of 4j per cent after the construction period should beincreased (to balance the provision for a reduced rate if Cunard&apos; return is less than 3 per cent).Lord Chandos has been asked for his opinion on the likelihood of securingthese improvements.     He thinks that the company might accept anarrangement to deal with (a) but only after the Government had firstagreed that the Report was otherwise acceptable.   He did not think thatthe company would agreed to (b).   We consider that it might well be worth the attempt.14.     We do not think that the company would agree to improve thesecurity for the loan.   It would, however, be desirable to find out whetherthey would be prepared to bear the cost of insuring the Governmentsinvestment.   In addition, the agreement would need to provide for theproportion in which the cost during the construction of the ship should beborne by the company and by the Government.Effect of subsidy on shipping policies and other Government loans15.     Because the subsidised North Atlantic express passenger services are regarded as unique, acceptance of the Chandos recommendations wouldnot prejudice our case against unjustifiable foreign subsidies for shipping.Some British shipowners may be critical of a Government loan to the cunard Company on preferential terms, while others are likely toconsider that such terms should be available to them as well as to the cunard Company.     But the Government should be able to resist any generaldemand from the British shipping industry for Government loans atpreferential rates.     The problems of the rest of the industry are not somuch shortage of capital or subsidised competition as the general surplusof shipping and discriminatory shipping practices like flag preference.16.    A loan to the Cunard Company at a rate of interest lower than thatat which the Government could borrow will be invoked as a precedent byother firms and especially by local authorities, but the Government couldresist such demands on the grounds that the replacement of the &quot;Queen&quot;liner is a special case.   The precedent is unlikely to embarrass theGovernment in settling the terms of loans under the Local EmploymentAct, I960.-4-
Foreign currency and sterling earnings17.    In considering whether the cost to the Government of replacing the &quot;Queen&quot; liner is justified, the foreign currency and sterling earnings of these ships should be taken into account.   In 1958 alone the total gross earnings of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; together amountedto  13 millions, of which some  8.9 millions were dollar earnings and 4.1 millions were earnings in the sterling area.   The position in 1959was similar.   If the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; were not replaced, not only would someforeign currency earnings be lost, but there would be some additional expenditure of foreign currency by British travellers to the extent thatthey travelled in foreign ships or aircraft instead.   The anticipated gross earnings of the new &quot;Queen&quot; liner are  7.9 millions, of which 5. 5 millions are expected to be dollar earnings and  2.4 millionsearnings in the sterling area.Use of productive resources18.    The shipyards likely to tender for the construction of a replacementliner are on Clydeside, the North East Coast and at Belfast.   All these areas would welcome the additional employment which this contractwould bring.   Building a replacement ship would probably take 3j to4 years from commencing construction and would employ an average labour force of, say, 2,000 to 2,500 during this period    The figure would be at its lowest, probably about 500, during the first year, rising afterlaunching and during fitting out to at least 4,000.   These figures are oflabour employed in the shipyard;  they do not include labour employedon sub-contracts outside the yard, which would be scattered widelythroughout the country.Arrangements for tenders19.    The announcement about the Chandos Committee&apos;s conclusion in the House of Commons on 1st June, I960, included their recommendation that the construction of the ship should be put out to open competitive tenderwith all appropriate shipyards.   It would be difficult for the Governmentto reject this recommendation, which has already been accepted by the cunard Company.   But there is likely to be resentment and criticism inScotland if the contract is not awarded to a Scottish shipyard.Conclusions20.    Non-replacement of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; would end our traditionalsupremacy in the weekly trans-Atlantic service.   In the view of most members of the Sub-Committee this would be damaging to British prestige and might affect our earnings of foreign currency.   These Ministers feelthat the Chandos recommendations, while they might be improved incertain respects in further negotiation, are not so onerous that theGovernment could claim that they should be relieved of their Election pledge21.    On the other hand, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has grave doubts as to the justification on prestige or economic grounds of acceptanceof the Chandos recommendations.   The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; is not due to be scrapped until 1965 at the earliest.   If, therefore, there were noreplacement, our supremacy would remain until that date, after which theUnited Kingdom would be operating only one such ship, and be in the same-5-
CONFIDENTIAL .        g 2position as the United States and France.    No decision to replace the&apos;&apos;Queen Elizabeth&quot; need be taken until 1968.   If the Government turneddown these recommendations they might offer alternative terms on whichthey would be willing to proceed.   To offer stiffer terms, which in theview of the Government were reasonable, would, even if they were rejected by the Company, not involve a breach of our Election pledge.Our pledge &quot;to support the replacement&quot; cannot mean support onany terms acceptable to the Company.   Alternatively, the Govern mentmight say that they would be willing to consider a scheme for the replacement of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; in the light of the conditions and prospects for sea travel in eight years&apos; time.   It might be that the best course for the Company to adopt after the withdrawal of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;from service would be to operate a single-ship service on schedulesagreed with other countries running North Atlantic liners.22.    I invite the views of my colleagues on these conclusions.M.Office of the Paymaster-General,S.W.I.1st July, I960.-6-
