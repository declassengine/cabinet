Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1960C. (60) 58 Copy No.    5 625th March, 1960CABINETTHE ROAD programme memorandum by the Minister of transport at Present Our roads are overloadedWe have the highest density in the world of vehicles per mile of road 1957figures were United Kingdom 29; Germany 22 (the next highest!); United States 19.Most trunk and class I roads have only two lanes. Overtaking is dangerous orimpossible for long distances. This leads to a drop in speeds and the taking of unnecessary risks. The Road Research Laboratory estimate that congestion costus  250 millions last year.  210 millions fell on industry and is double what wespend on roads.In Future It will get worse because vehicles are increasing over three times as fast as roads2.   Between now and 1965 increases will be:(a) Vehicles. From 8-1 to 11 million&apos; nearly 30 per cent, increase.(b) Motorways and new trunk roads (including major improvements). -Tothe present 6,380 miles we shall add only 575 miles less than 10 percent.At the beginning of 1960 we had 8^ million vehicles. In 1975 there will be16 million. The situation is critical now and is steadily getting worse.Roads should match vehicles3. we ought not to allow cars to increase at present rates without buildingroads to match. We should build more roads or limit the number of cars. To doneither means traffic really will be chaotic in 1964 a most inconvenient year.We need at least a  100 millions per annum road programme. We should outline a ten-year road programme and definitely fix the magnitude of the programme for the next five years. I believe nothing less than 550 millions is needed for this-five-year period. A programme of  630 millions would be better. The ten-year programme is at Appendix A. Two alternativefive-year programmes are at Appendix B.Revenue from new road vehicles registered between now and 1964 will pay forsuch a programme. This year we are spending on roads a smaller proportion of taxes collected from motorists than any other country with  110 millions spent (includingmaintenance) against about  600 millions to be collected. A comparison withother countries is at Appendix C. The present amount retained by the exchequer is not reduced under my proposals.  The whole of the additional expenditure for56772BTHIS DOCUMENT IIS TifllE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S.GOVERNMENT
which I ask, over the level of expenditure already authorised, could be met fromthe extra revenue which will be collected from new cars coming on the roads inthe next five years. (In the last five years revenue rose annually by  35 millions.In the next five years it will rise by at least  35 millions each year making a totalof at least  525 millions extra to be collected in the five years.)ffaxes from new cars can pay for my road programme. I must stress that it is the avalanche of additional cars which will create acritical situation. But the taxes they pay will meet my proposals. And if myestimate of new cars proves to be too high then the programme could be slowed down by reducing starts.Roads for 1964 must be initiated now7. If we want roads by 1964 the decision to start must be made now. to wait for another year will be too late. This is because of the time taken to settle the line of a road, acquire the land and get the road built.recommendation. I seek the agreement of my colleagues to a ten-year road programme along the lines set out in Appendix A and to a programme of road expenditure over thenext five years totalling not less than  550 millions and not more than  635 millions.The annual payments are shown below. 635 millionsprogramme 550 millionsprogramme1960-611961-621962-631963-641964-6583-690 0112-3164-4183-87892106133138E. M.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,24th March, I960.
APPENDIX ATHE MASTER PLANOur estimates of future road traffic growth show it increases at an average annual rate of 5 per cent, compound reaching a level of 1959 plus 150 per cent,in 20 years. Our figures are consistent with the growth in the number of motor vehicles on the road as estimated by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and traders in a paper to the Committee on Motor Industry Prospects; namely13 million in 1970 (including 10-6 million cars) more than 15 million in 1975(including 13-5 million cars) leading to an ultimate figure of perhaps 18 million to 19 million vehicles overall.2. These figures represent a situation of an entirely different order from theadmittedly critical situation which v/e know to-day when there are about eightmillion vehicles in total on the road. If we are to start making up the backlogand prepare for the greatly aggravated conditions which will soon be upon us,we must be able to put in hand an overall plan designed progressively to bringthe situation under control; moreover we must put it in hand at once, since it takes anything up to four years to bring a major project to maturity.3. We can hope, given the resources, to make a considerable impact on thesituation within five years. But a master plan must look beyond a five-year period.Such a plan must provide for:(a) The completion of the system of motorways, on which a start has beenmade.(b) The complete modernisation of certain trunk roads which will either befeeders to the motorways or complementary main traffic routes and join the major conurbations to these through routes.(c) The redevelopment of urban roads.(d) The removal of traffic bottle-necks.4. I consider that a ten-year plan at a total estimated cost of the order of 1,500 millions is necessary to achieve this purpose. The general outlines of this plan are already clear and more detailed work including the phasing of itscomponent parts, is now proceeding intensively. In broad terms I propose thatwe build 800 miles of motorway and improve some 1,200 miles of trunk road ata cost, including land, &amp;c, of about  900 millions. This will replace or modernisea quarter of our trunk roads and will benefit at least half the traffic moving.The remaining  600 millions would be spent on classified roads, mainly on urbanworks where traffic is densest and congestion most acute. I am satisfied that thisis essential and it represents no more than what the local authorities have told methey are anxious and willing to do.5. The attached Map A shows the motorways programme and those sectionsof our trunk roads where the gross overloading warrants an overall improvementof the type which is being adopted for the Great North Road. It shows the basicnetwork of super highways on the great through routes which the master plan willbuild. It does not show of course the small schemes or even isolated major schemes, categories which account for a quarter of the cost of trunk roadimprovements. Map B attached shows those parts of the ten-year master planwhere the road works would be completed wholly or over substantial lengths bylate 1964.March, I960.56772

APPENDIX BTHE NEXT FIVE years the Next Five Years: Financial Years 1960-61, 1964-65, inclusiveIt is naturally possible to phase the first five years of a ten-year programme on different hypotheses without prejudicing the ultimate completion of the totalplan. Moreover, a build-up from a lower to a higher rate is likely to mean that expenditure in the first five years will in any case be smaller than in the remainingyears. My Department have considered two possible bases for the first five-year programme.(a) Maximum rate involving payments of  634 millions.(b) A modified rate involving payments of  550 millions.It can be stated at once that the present  300 millions programme will be totally inadequate for the problems we face.The implications of the present programme . Indeed, the present programme will not permit the road programme already announced in the last Parliament to be completed in a reasonable time.In essence, the announced programme consists of the five major projects plus suchurban and other works as could be fitted into the financial limits. The five major projects, together with their completion dates, under the present programme aregiven below:Projects(a) Modernisation of Great North Road(b) London-PenrithYorkshire SpurMotorway     with(c) London-Channel    Ports,Medway Motorway(d) Midland-South WalesincludingCompletion date the London-Newcastle section will be substan-tially completed by 1964. There will remainapproximately 40 miles which will still be three-lane road and which will be dealt withsubsequently.London-Birmingham already open.Birmingham-Preston 1964.Preston By-pass already open.Preston-Lancaster 1966.Lancaster By-pass 1960.Lancaster-Penrith 1971.Southern half of Yorkshire Spur 1966.Northern half of Yorkshire Spur-1967.Sheffield-Leeds-1969.Medway Motorway 1964.Other improvements 1968-70.Lydiate-Twyning (Eastern end of Ross Spur) 1961.Ross Spur-1960.Twyning-Severn Bridge 1970.(e) London to the Airport and the West   Chiswick-Langley 1965.The implications of this would be as follows. The Birmingham-Preston Motorwaywould have to be constructed in three separate sections with starting dates spreadover four years. The Severn Bridge would be left without adequate links to theeast for some years and the motorways centred on Birmingham would also beleft without adequate links. Even these completion dates depend upon an extremely low rate of expenditure on other projects; viz., a reduction to only 15 millions a year for authorisations for all trunk roads including the Great NorthRoad; and the same figure for all classified roads including urban works. Thesefigures have been deliberately depressed in order to permit the five major projects to be completed as soon as possible under the total financial limitationof the present programme. In practice, however, they will certainly prove totally inadequate. Even if the position could be held on the trunk roads, it is virtuallycertain that so much pressure would build up for more to be done on urban worksthat it would prove necessary to modify the rate of progress on the five major projects and certainly to defer for a very long time any extensions of them.
Comparison of the three five-year programmesMotorways3. Under the present programme the position by the end of the financialyear 1964-65 would be as follows:Motorwdys Completed           Mileage	Birmingham-Preston	86Lancaster By-pass.       .........	11Lydiate (near Birmingham)-Twyning and	sp to the Ross Spur    ......	27Ross Spur          ......       ......	22Birmingham-London     ...      ...	74Medvvay    Motorway    and   Maidstone	By-pass           ......      ......	32Doncaster By-pass (part of Great North	Road improvement)	15Stevenage By-pass (part of Great North	Road improvement)   ......	13Maidenhead By-pass     ......	6Newport By-pass          ...      ......	7In Hand MileagePreston-Lancaster         ......      ... 15Sandiacre-Crick (part of Yorkshire Spur) 43Darlington By-pass (further part of GreatNorth Road)    ...      ...      ...... 8Durham Motorway (further part of GreatNorth Road).........      ... 21London-Eastern   end   of   MaidenheadBy-pass           ......      ...      ... 17Under the  550 millions programme, all the above would have been completedexcept the Durham Motorway which would be advanced 12 months. Otherswould be in hand, the most important of which is possibly the start of the Midlandlinks joining the three main motorways.  Changes are summarised below:Additional MotorwaysCompleted MileagePreston-Lancaster ...      ...      ... 15Sandiacre-Crick .......... 43Darlington By-Pass       ......      ... 8London-Eastern   end   of   MaidenheadBy-pass ...      ...      ...      ... 17Additional Motorwaysin Hand MileageMidland Links    ...      ...      ......   45Doncaster-Sandiacre      .........   43Under the  634 millions programme the construction of the Motorways would be advanced as much as the state of preparation and statutory procedures permit.The improvements on the  550 millions programme would be as follows:Additional Motorways Additional MotorwaysCompleted Mileage in Hand MileageMidland Links    .........      ...   45       Twyning-Severn Bridge           ...... 41Chippenham-Severn Bridge and Newport 45London-Basingstoke      ......      ... 37Lancashire-Yorkshire     ...      ...      ... 50Hendon Motorway        ...      ...      ... 4Lancaster-Penrith          ......... 38Trunk Roads4. Under the  634 millions programme it would be possible to spend about 170 millions on Trunk Roads (including land) and thus make substantial progress towards the implementation of the master plan; under the  550 millions programme the figure would be some  15 millions less, but under the present programme itwould drop to under  90 millions and would be insufficient to complete even those schemes the preparation of which has already been authorised.Classified Roads5. Local Authorities have submitted to us a programme which would require a grant of  60 millions per annum. This is provided for under the maximumprogramme, while the  550 millions programme would allow for a grant Of. 50 millions per annum. The present programme allows for a grant of only 15 millions per annum. As stated in paragraph 2 above this would be totally inadequate. A grant of at least  10 millions per annum is likely to be necessaryfor London and the Birmingham conurbation alone.
The Annual Cost6. The annual payment rates involved in the two alternative five-yearprogrammes would be as follows: 634 millions  550 millions1960-61        ......       83-6 781961-62        ......       90 0 921962-63        ......      112-3 061963-64        ......      164-4 1331964-65        ......      183-8 138The programme would involve the following commitment rates:1960-61        ......       99-9 981961-62        ......      133-8 1031962-63        ......      165-6 1^61963-64        ......      173-9 1551964-65        ......      176-8 119The Choice between the  634 millions and  550 millions Programmes7. I consider that the  634 millions programme would be fully justifiedparticularly since the present backlog is so great that a sharp and rapid increasein effort is necessary. However, I should regard the  550 millions programme as acceptable although it will mean a steeper increase in expenditure between 1965and 1970 in order to complete the master plan.March, 1960.
