9194- I LPrinted for the Cabinet.   May I960C. (60) 87 Copy No.  5424th May, 1960CABINETTARIFF negotiations memorandum by the Minister of State, Board of trade on the 16th May, the European Economic Association Committee considered a paper by the President of the Board of Trade about a statement which he proposedto make (in reply to an arranged written Parliamentary Question) on the UnitedKingdom attitude to the forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) tariff negotiations. The Committee agreed generally with the President^analysis and invited him, after his discussions with Ministers of the European free trade Association (E.F.T.A.) in Lisbon, to submit the draft statement to theCabinet.2. The tariff negotiations will provide a useful opportunity for carrying astep further our policy of negotiating reductions in the tariffs of the United States.In addition, it will provide an opportunity for negotiation on the common tariffof the European Economic Community (E.E.C.).3. While our objective must still be the achievement of a single european market by some form of association between E.E.C. and E.F.T.A., and theinternational atmosphere may now be more favourable, there can be no assurance of success. The GATT negotiations will provide an opportunity for securing asubstantial reduction in the tariff barriers against us in Europe; in taking it, weshall be acting consistently with our ultimate object of free trade in Europe, weshall hearten our friends inside the Six, and if we succeed we shall blunt thesharpness of the division which threatens Europe.4. The purpose of making a public statement of our attitude to the negotiations is two-fold. First, it will be to our advantage internationally to take the initiativewith a forthcoming statement of our attitude towards negotiations with the E.E.C.and thus to dispel any suspicion that the United Kingdom is less liberal in commercial policy than the Six. Secondly, we need to give a clearer lead to ourown industry as to the role we see for the negotiations in the strategy of our approach to the problems in Europe.5. I annex a draft of the statement which, if my colleagues agree, I proposeto make forthwith.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1,24th May, 1960.annex draft Reply to an Arranged Written Parliamentary Question&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcomed the initiative of the United StatesGovernment which led to the calling of the forthcoming GATT Tariff Conference.They hope that negotiations at the Conference will lead to substantial reductions!in tariff barriers. The United Kingdom will enter into negotiations with theUnited States and the European Economic Community and will be ready to exchange important tariff reductions over a wide range of our imports foe comparable reductions in tariffs against our exports.&quot;24th May, 1960.57073
