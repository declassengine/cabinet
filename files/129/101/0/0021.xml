ANNEXEUROPEAN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL* ^It is proposed to establish five centres, under an international Agency, tocontrol upper air space over the six Common Market countries and the UnitedKingdom. Traffic over this country would be controlled initially from London andPrestwick.2. A planning directorate and evaluation unit would be set up as soon as the protocol is signed and the Convention would come into effect when enoughcountries had ratified to make the control organisation practicable.cost. For the first three years the gross cost would be shared on the basis of the gross National Product, making the United Kingdom share 29 per cent.Subsequently the sharing of recurrent costs would be partly on the basis of the extentof each country&apos;s actual use of euro control.4. Estimates of cost are very tentative as yet since the technical plans are still being worked out. The total extra cost to the United Kingdom of joiningEurocontrol as compared with providing an independent but compatible systemmight be of the following order:Between million and  1  million for capital expenditure and between ^ million and  1J million for annual recurrent expenditure during the first threeyears, commencing, so far as can be foreseen, in 1962. In the fourth and subsequent years the United Kingdom share of recurrent expenditure may increase to an extra cost of between  ^ million and  2 million. The United Kingdom share in the first year of the planning directorate and evaluation centre is expected to be about 47,000. All these figures are gross, and could, be reduced by the imposition of charges on the operators. The United Kingdom representatives have pressed forthis and it will be further discussed at the next meeting of officials on 2nd May.Fuller details on costs have been supplied to the Treasury.Administration5. Decisions on many of the policy issues would be decided by a majority vote, with the voting weighted to reflect the size.of national contributions. Themethod proposed does not reflect the size of the United Kingdom financial contribution as well as it might. We are trying to improve this but it may not bepossible to negotiate a better arrangement.legislation. Legislation would be required to permit the control of aircraft over theUnited Kingdom by the Agency; to provide for contributions towards its cost ona permanent basis; for establishing the legal identity of the Agency; and forsecuring its immunities and privileges in this country.North Atlantic Council7. The North Atlantic Council have approved euro control in principleprovided that military security is not harmed. It will be necessary to report tothe Council before the Convention is opened for signature.Ministry of Aviation, W.C. 2,13th April, I960.
