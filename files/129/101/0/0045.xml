Printed for the Cabinet.   June I960C. (60) 95 Copy No. 5516th June, I960CABINETROAD TRAVEL EXPENSES OF PEERS AND MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 8th May, 1958, the Cabinet considered an Opposition proposal that members of Parliament should be entitled to claim refund of expenses, equivalentto the cost of a first-class return ticket, in respect of journeys to and from their constituencies in their own motor cars (C.C. (58) 39th Conclusions, Minute 2).The view was expressed that this suggestion was not unreasonable; but it wasdecided that the time was inopportune for passing the Resolution that would benecessary, and the Cabinet invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and myself, to give the idea further consideration indue course.2. Following the Election further discussions have been held and if mycolleagues approve, a scheme can now be introduced at an early date. There ispressure for it from the House, and in reply to a Question from the Leader of theOpposition on 24th March, the Prime Minister agreed that the Government would do its best to consider it urgently and favourably.3. I am in agreement with the Home Secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary,and the Chief Whip that it is important that any scheme should be simple and thatit should be left to the House Authorities to work out its detailed administration.What we have in mind therefore is a scheme of the following kind, going in some respects a little further than that originally envisaged.(i) Members would be authorised to claim refund of expenses for carjourneys up to the cost of the first-class rail fare for journeys already covered in the existing scheme for rail, air and sea travel, i.e., journeysbetween home, constituency and the House.(ii) The scheme would apply to all private motor vehicles or hired cars, andnot merely to Members&apos; own cars. Its extension to travel by publicroad transport is not at present contemplated there seems no realdemand for it but the Resolution the House would be asked to approve would permit this extension later by administrative means ifit became desirable.(iii) The maximum sum to be claimed would be the cost of the actual railjourney now permitted not the road mileage at the cost per mile railfare. (It is understood that Members would be content with thisarrangement which would be a great deal simpler and easier to administer than anything like a mileage allowance.)(iv) It would be for the House Authorities to devise a practice to cover caseswhere clearly less than the maximum should be claimed. examples are: that where a car is shared by two or more Members only one claimcould be made; that less should be claimed in the few instances wherethe rail journey, being a zig -zag, is markedly longer than the direct roaddistance; that Members using three-wheeled motor vehicles or evenmotor-cycles could naturally not claim the full rail cost; and that whereMembers hold season tickets claims in respect of car journeys shouldbe restricted to one a week.

(v) There will be no restriction upon the number of journeys on parliamentary business for which a Member could claim his expenses in this way, butto guard against the possibility that the scheme might prove more expensive than at present anticipated the right would have to be reserved to introduce, if need be, a closer control in this respect.^ 4. It is proposed that these main rules should be recorded in a statementmadS at or before the introduction of the Resolution authorising the scheme. TheResolution itself could, in accordance with precedent, be simple and general.5. It would, of course, be necessary to apply these new arrangements to theHouse of Lords and this could be done without alteration in the existing minimumattendances rule. At the same time it is suggested that we should rectify a littlediscrepancy between the rules governing travel expenses applying to the two Houses.Under the terms of the relevant Resolution a Member of Parliament can reclaimthe whole cost of a permitted journey by air, whereas a Peer can only claim up tothe rail fare for the journey in question. If we corrected this anomaly, arrangements with two Houses will be brought fully into line with each other.6. The cost of the scheme for the Commons is extremely difficult to assess, butit is not thought likely to exceed  40,000 a year and a Supplementary Estimate willbe necessary. The cost for the House of Lords is thought likely to be negligible.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,15th June, 1960.
