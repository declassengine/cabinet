(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 86 COPY NO.   A jj*25th May, I960CABINETSOUTH AFRICAN REFUGEES IN THEHIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsWhen the Union Government in April declared an emergency andembarked on a policy of widespread arrests (there are now some 1,700persons in detention) a small number of people came to one or other of theHigh Commission Territories, and declared that they had come for political reasons.    The present estimate of adult refugees is:-Basutoland 17Bechuanaland Protectorate 15Swaziland 20All, or nearly all, of those in Basutoland are Africans, and of those inSwaziland, Europeans, these being accompanied by about a dozen children.Those in the Bechuanaland Protectorate are partly African and partlyEuropean.2.      About one-third of the total number is known to be Communist orto have Communist associations.    Although allowance must be made forthe South African propensity to label as Communist persons who would beregarded in this country as no more than Left-Wing Socialists, some ofthose people are known to have been in touch with the Communist Party ofGreat Britain.3. The presence of these refugees in the High Commission Territoriesraises a number of problems; -Residence permitsMaintenanceTravel documentsAction under the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881.My proposals for action are contained in paragraphs 4, 11 and 14 below.Residence Permits4.     In Basutoland the control of entry and residence is, for practical purposes, in Basuto hands and, at the time of the constitutional discussions in December, 1958, it was recognised that this should be so.    At present no difficulty is foreseen over the admission of refugees from the Union to-1-
JBasutoland.    In the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland there are different provisions for Europeans and Africans.    Since it is difficult orimpossible for refugees from the Union to comply with the normal requirements for securing residence permits, the High Commissioner,with my approval, promulgated Proclamations at the beginning of Aprilenabling him, in exceptional circumstances, to sanction the entry orcontinued presence in those two Territories of persons who would other-wise be there in contravention of the normal laws.     These amendingProclamations empowered him, in granting special residencepermits, to impose conditions and to cancel the permits at any time.The High Commissioner has not yet issued any special permits but, ifrefugees are to remain in Bechuanaland and Swaziland much longer, hewill need to do so, since some of them are already in breach of the normalconditions.    He has proposed that such permits should be valid for alimited period, still to be defined, and should be subject to the condition,the breach of which could be penalised by fine or, in default, imprison-ment, that the holders shall not take part in politics.    The definition of&quot;take part in politics&quot; will need careful drafting.    Subject to this, Ipropose to authorise the High Commissioner to issue temporary specialpermits for up to three months at a time.Maintenance5.     Although it has been reported that some of the refugees are getting into financial difficulties, no occasion has yet arisen for maintenancefrom official sources.    Some of them are believed to have received funds from the Ghana Government or from unofficial sources, such as ChristianAction.Travel Documents6.      Some of the refugees want to travel further, some to the UnitedKingdom, some to Ghana, some to the United Nations.    They do not needany papers in order to leave the High Commission Territories.     They donot need any papers in order to re-enter the Union but, ex hypo the si, theydo not want to do this.     The other normal routes are, from Bechuanaland,to or through Southern Rhodesia, and, from Swaziland, to or throughMozambique.     Both these countries require would-be visitors ortransients to be in possession of valid passports or other travel documents.Other countries on the route to the end destinations have similarrequirements.     If a person is a British subject - and, by the british nationality Act, 1948, Union Nationals are British subjects (commonwealth citizens) he may enter the United Kingdom if he can satisfy animmigration officer that he is a British subject.     He does not require apassport to do this.    The High Commissioner at present has before himfour applications for United Kingdom passports from South Africanrefugees in the Bechuanaland Protectorate.    None of the four is a united Kingdom citizen.    One of the applications, viz. , fromMr. Arnold Selby, who is believed to be a Communist, is supported by-Mrs. Barbara Castle, M. P.    The High Commissioner has req\xestedinstructions.    The normal practice would be to refer the applicants to theSouth African authorities.    This would be unrealistic in these cases.They would not get passports and, by applying, they would reveal theirwhereabouts to the South African authorities.
7.      The Ghana Government have given me a list of 20 names of refugees in the High Commission Territories (17 adults and 3 children)whose fares and travel expenses to Ghana they are willing to pay.    nine of these are believed to be Communists.    One of them has a UnitedKingdom passport and another is eligible for one.    Mr. Geoffrey Bing,the Attorney-General of Ghana, has evolved a form of certificate of commonwealth citizenship which the Ghana Government are prepared togive to South African citizens who cannot obtain passports from theirown Government.    They have sent an official to Salisbury, SouthernRhodesia, to ascertain whether these certificates will be recognised bythe Federal Government for the purpose of transiting the Federation.He has been told that they will not be recognised.    The federal authorities have told us that they are unwilling to recognise any documentsissued by the Ghana Government but would be willing to recognise anydocuments issued by the United Kingdom Government.    The GhanaGovernment are reported to have chartered an aircraft to uplift sevenSouth African citizens in Bechuanaland for the Belgian Congo on28th and 29th May.     Mrs. Bing has visited the High commission territories in a chartered aircraft, and is believed to have made these arrangements during her visit.8.      When Mr. Louw, the South African Minister of External Affairs,was in London, I twice discussed with him the possibility of our issuingto South African refugees in the High Commission Territories some kindof travel document which would be valid for a short period and for onejourney only to this country.     Mr.. Louw disliked the whole idea.    I got the impression that he would not object to our giving a limited number,but that he would object to our opening up what he called an escape route through Bechuanaland.     I told him that we might find it necessary toissue a limited number in twos and threes over the next few weeks.    I did not ask him to agree, but merely not to disagree publicly.    He saidthat he would consult his colleagues on his return to South Africa.    Ihave not so far heard further from him.9.      The arguments for our issuing travel documents are:-(a) As long as these persons are in the High commission territories, they are liable to become a focus of intrigueagainst the Union Government and of discontent within the territories.(b) They may also involve us in difficulties with the UnionGovernment, if the latter invoke the Fugitive OffendersAct.(c) There is little opportunity of useful local employment forthem.(d) Since these people are (under our law) entitled to leavethe Territories and to enter the United Kingdom, it isdifficult to justify the refusal of a document to help them to travel from the Territories to the UnitedKingdom.
(e)    If we do not issue travel documents, the Ghana Govern-ment or the Indian Government may well do so, and otherwise interfere in the High Commission Territories,as the Ghana Government are already beginning to do.10.    The arguments against our issuing travel documents are;-(a) It is contrary to all precedent since the British nationality act, 1948, that we should issue travel documents tocitizens of another Commonwealth country, except asagents for, and at the request of, their own Government.(b) If we start, we may attract an influx of refugees.(c) It is an offence against the South African Departure from theUnion Regulation Act, 1955, for South African citizens toleave the area of the Union-cum-High commission territories without a valid travel document as defined inthe Act.    The definition excludes any document that weissued to South African citizens.    The Union Governmentmay regard us as abetting their citizens to commit an offence against South African law.(d) Our action, and its consequences, could provoke the UnionGovernment into establishing a system of requiring traveldocuments in order to pass from the Union to the high commission Territories, or vice versa, which would be detrimental to the economy and administration of the territories.(e) We shall assume a share of the responsibility and the odium,for the subsequent activities of these people if, for instance,they go to the United Nations to start attacks there on theUnion Government, or attempt to set up a &quot;Committee ofNational Liberation&quot; in Accra.11.     There is a lot to be said for giving travel documents to the fourpersons whose applications are awaiting answers, though it is awkwardthat they are Communists or near-Communists.    Alternatively, wecould try to stand aside for a bit longer, and see the result of the reported arrangements for a privately arranged air lift to the belgian congo.Fugitive Offenders Act, 188112.     On 16th May, Mr.  Erasmus, the South African Minister ofJustice, said in the House of Assembly that, of 27 fugitive South AfricanCommunists, two were in Basutoland, four in Bechuanaland and 14 inSwaziland and that the Union Government were negotiating with theBritish Government to get these Communists back to the Unionj  that before the negotiations were concluded the Emergency Regulations couldnot be repealed;  and that these persons were in the High commission territories, organising against South Africa.    This made it necessaryfor us to state in Parliament on 19th May that no negotiations on this
subject were in progress and that it was not the intention to compel personswho had come to the Territories for political reasons to return to theUnion on political grounds, though the question of return to answercriminal charges would be a matter for the courts.13. The Act specifies two main methods of recovering a fugitiveoffender.     Part I, which applies, for instance, between the Union ofSouth Africa and the United Kingdom, provides procedure whereby afugitive, who is wanted on a Union warrant for an offence punishable byimprisonment for one year or more, may be apprehended in the UnitedKingdom, brought before a court and if, (a) the court is satisfied that theevidence produced against the fugitive raises a strong or probablepresumption of guilt;  (b) the Commonwealth Secretary thinks it just, his return to the Union may be ordered.     Part II provides a simplerprocedure, which may be applied by Order-in-Council to groups ofcontinguous territories.    This procedure was applied in 1913 between theUnion of South Africa and Tiasutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate,Swaziland, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    Underthis procedure it suffices for the Union authorities to send to the territorywhere the fugitive is, or is believed to be, a warrant for the arrest ofthat person for any offence punishable by law in the Union.    Providedthat the magistrate is satisfied that the warrant has been properly issued,he may back the warrant.    It is not necessary to bring evidence of thecommission of the offence, and when the person is arrested the magistrateorders his return to South Africa if he is satisfied that the fugitive hasbeen correctly identified.    There is provision for the magistrate (or asuperior court) not to order the return of the prisoner -&quot;if it is made to appear to a magistrate or to a superior courtthat by reason of the trivial nature of the case, or by reason ofthe application for the return of such prisoner not being madein good faith in the interests of justice or otherwise, it would,having regard to the distance, to the facilities of communication and to all the circumstances of the case, be unjust or oppressive,or too severe a punishment, to return the prisoner ...&quot;There is no provision in either part of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881,corresponding to that in Extradition Act, 1870, specifically excludingpolitical offences from the offences for which the return of a fugitivemay be requested or ordered.    On the other hand there are one or twodecided cases which contain obiter dicta indicating that &quot;all thecircumstances&quot; in the above-quoted section might permit a court torefuse to return a fugitive when the offence charged is a political one.If the Union authorities v/ere to secure warrants for the arrest of someof the refugees in the High Commission Territories for alleged offences against, for instance, the South African Suppression of CommunismAct, 19 50, and then to ask for the return of those persons from the territories under the Fugitive Offenders Act, a delicate politicalsituation would arise.    It would be open to a court to refuse to ordertheir return, on one of the grounds in the section quoted above, but wecould not be certain in advance that the court would refuse.    Meanwhile,we are in any case likely to be under pressure in Parliament either toamend the Act of 1881 in order to exclude the possibility of a fugitivebeing returned for a political offence, or at least to amend the 1913Order-in-Council so as to exclude political offences from the scope of
those to which the procedure Under Part II applies between the Union andthe British Territories in Southern and Central Africa.    The second course would be technically possible, but there would be constitutional and political complications.     We could not very well amend the Order-in-Council solely in respect of the High Commission Territories, while leaving the position as it is in the Central African Territories.    But, ifwe wanted to amend it also in respect of the Central African Territories,we should have to overcome the difficulty that fugitive offenders is a subject within the responsibility of the Federal Government under theFederal Constitution, 1953.     We are committed to refrain fromlegislating for the Federation except at the request and with the consentof the Federal Government, and it is far from certain that this would be forthcoming.14. In these circumstances, I propose that:-(a) We should take the line in Parliament that there is at present no actual question of the return of a fugitive for allegedpolitical offences being requested under Part II of the1881 Act, so that it is not necessary to amend either theAct or the 1913 Order-in-Council but that, if the question should arise, we should be willing to consider thedesirability of amending the Order-in-Council.(b) We should represent to the Union Government forthwith thedifficulty with which we shall be faced if they put themachinery of the 1881 Act into operation for an offencewhich would be likely to be regarded in this country asa political offence, and express the hope that they willnot find it necessary to do so.H.Commonwealth Relations Office,S.
