(TH2S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)BOYCOTT OF TRADE WITH SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesAn urgent request for instructions has been received from theGovernor of British Guiana, whose Ministers recently informed him inExecutive Council that they intended to support a motion of the Leader ofthe Opposition recommending a ban on trade with South Africa.     TheGovernor has already, but without success, done his utmost to dissuadehis Ministers from this course.    He will have the power, pending theamendment to the Constitution agreed at the recent conference, to actagainst this advice.     What should I instruct him to do?2.        Jamaica proposed a similar ban last year.    My predecessorwas advised that they could be prevented from imposing the ban only byan amendment by Order-in-Council.either of the Jamaican or of theWest Indies Constitution or by the passage of an Act of Parliament here.My predecessor concluded, after consulting the Commonwealth Secretary,that formal intervention was not politically practicable.3.        The South African Government were told that, although theUnited Kingdom Government disapproved of the step taken by Jamaica,we could not take any effective action.    The South African Governmentpublicly stated that they regarded the matter in a serious light and urgedthat, since the West Indies Federation was not yet an independent State,sovereign power still rested with the United Kingdom Government.    they further took the view that the action of Jamaica constituted interference in South africa s domestic affairs.    In private the South African Govern-ment also indicated that Jamaica&apos;s action might affect their attitude if and when the question of the admission of the West Indies Federation to membership of the Commonwealth came up for consideration in the future4.        It was understood at the time  that what troubled South Africamost was not the economic effect of the boycott but the fear that otherColonies would follow suit.    None did so immediately, but theGovernment of Antigua imposed a similar ban on 30th March, I960.    this action was taken under existing legislation (under the terms of theAntigua Constitution the Administrator , i3 bound to accept the advice ofhis Executive Council in such matters and is not required to seek my instructions), and I had no prior knowledge of it.    In Nigeria aresolution in favour of a boycott has been passed by the House ofRepresentatives (and in the Regional Houses).    The Government of st. Lucia show every sign of following Antigua&apos;s example.    similar action is under consideration in Barbados and Trinidad.0(60) 8931st May, I960CABINET-1-
5.        The question whether intervention by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentis called for is further complicated by the fact that (except for Jamaica)these territories and British Guiana subscribe to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G. A. T. T. ), Articles II and XI of which would becontravened by a trade ban.    The embargo imposed by Antiguaconstitutes a breach of Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;3 obligations underG. A. T. T.     So would that contemplated by the other territoriesmentioned.6. The British Guiana problem has a special significance since therewe have the power, without new legislation, to prevent a ban.7.        The arguments against intervening are, however, formidable.Our obligations under G. A. T. T. provide too narrow a basis upon which to justify &quot;disciplining&quot; such Colonies as we can.    This is not merely because I imagine that most other members of G. A. T. T. would probablyignore breaches in this context, but also because, if we stand upon theprinciple that our obligations under G. A. T. T. are over-riding, then weshould surely have to defend them everywhere, by taking special powerto do so   (e.g. , in Antigua), as well as by using powers which we already possess, e. g. , in British Guiana and Nigeria - and I do not regard this aspolitically practicable.8.        In British Guiana we cannot exclude the possibility that inter-vention would lead to civil disturbances.    Moreover, the effect of apolitical crisis in British Guiana might stimulate elsewhere just the sort of action which we want to avoid;   and if, for example, Nigeria were stunginto giving effect to the resolutions already passed in favour of a boycott,we should be in a thoroughly embarrassing position.    Further, it hasbecome very rare indeed for a Governor, even if free to do so,deliberately to reject the advice of his Ministers after he has exhaustedall his powers of persuasion;   and in relation to public opinion locally,in the United Kingdom and throughout the world, an occasion of this kind would be a singularly unfortunate one on which to make an exception tothat general practice.9.        My recommendations are as follows:-(a) We should continue everywhere to try to dissuade ColonialMinisters from taking official Government action againstSouth Africa.    If we fail we should suggest that they limitthemselves to making a public appeal for a boycott ratherthan imposing one officially.    This would at least get usover our difficulties with G. A. T. T.    (My colleagues should,however, know that the second expedient which I have just mentioned has no chance in British Guiana, as the governor has already unsuccessfully urged upon his Ministers that anything which they may insist upon doing in this contextshould stop short of official Government action.)-2-
(b)    If we fail even in this, and Ministers insist upon an officialban, we should not use against them such ultimate powersof coercion as we may possess.I. M.Colonial Office, 5. W; 1.31st May, I960.-3-COWFIDENTIAL
