(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 57 COPY NO. SZ23rd March, I960CABINETMANUFACTURE OF DART ENGINES IN india memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his memorandum C.(60) 56, the Minister of Aviation sets out the background to his proposal that we should waive 7 5 per cent of the levy of about  280,000 due to the United Kingdom Government from theagreement recently concluded between Rolls-Royce Limited and theIndian Government for the manufacture of Dart engines in India.2.        It is clearly important that we should not prejudice our prospects of future sales in India, and I recognise the part played by the IndianMinister of Defence, Mr. Krishna Menon, in these matters.   If nothing more were at stake than the sum of  200,000 or so immediately at issue in respect of the Dart levy, there might be some case for meetingMr. Menon&apos;s request.   But this is not so.3.        There are, as the Minister says, a number of precedents for abating or foregoing altogether levies on sales of aircraft.   these reductions, however, have been agreed to assist the manufacturerwhen he could not afford to pay the full levy out of the best price at which the sale could be negotiated,   and when in the absence ofsome concession on the levy he would have felt obliged to abandon thesale.   In no previous case has the levy become a matter for discussion between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the customer.   Nor has therepreviously been any proposal to reduce a levy, not to assist the manufacturer to bring his negotiations with the customer to a successful conclusion, but as a concession to the customer after hissignature of the contract.4.        To reduce a levy in these circumstances may be expected to havetwo unfortunate results.   In the first place, it may well attract adversecriticism in the Public Accounts Committee.   In their past considerationof this question, the Committee have made clear their dislike of levyreductions, and have expressed the view that a reduction in an agreedrate of levy should not normally be sanctioned unless there would otherwise be an unreasonably low return to the manufacturer.   This pointdoes not arise in the present case, where reduction of the levy is proposedin the interest not of the manufacturer but of the customer.5.        A concession to Mr. Menon on the Dart must be expected tohave important consequences for our prospects of securing levypayments in future sales overseas.   The reluctance of the Indians topay a price for British aircraft which includes a   sum due to theUnited Kingdom Government in respect of development costs is perhapsunderstandable, though quite unjustifiable.   If we give way in the present .case, we must expect them to put great pressue on us to forego our levy-1-CON FIDENTIAL
on all future sales.   Further, British manufacturers will be quickto detect the possibility of using the levy as a bargaining factor in their negotiations with oversea   Governments, by encouraging the latter toput pressure on us to facilitate a sale by giving up our receipt.   Asthe Minister himself points out, India is potentially an important market for British aircraft and the loss of our levies on these sales would bea serious matter.   Moreover, if we lost our levies on sales to Indiaour position on many other oversea   sales would be undermined.6.        The right of the Government to participate in the proceeds of sales of aircraft which have been developed and manufactured withExchequer assistance is an important feature of our new policy towardsthe aircraft industry.   This right of participation, however, wouldappear to be no less vulnerable than the present levy arrangements tothe sort of approach which Mr. Menon is making on the Dart.    It seemsimportant not to prejudice the new arrangements from the outset.7.        Against these considerations must be weighed the risk to our prospects of future sales to India if we make no concession to Mr. Menon.How serious is this risk?    It seems unlikely that the recollection of a concession on the Dart levy would be decisive in persuading the indians in a future case to buy a British aircraft rather than a foreigncompetitor.   If they believed that their requirements would be moreadequately met by the foreign type, it would be very surprising if they didnot either buy the foreign aircraft or else demand some new concession of us as the price of buying British.   If, on the other hand, their considered view was that the British type would suit them best, theywould hardly go so far as deliberately to choose an inferior foreignproduct merely because we had disappointed them on the Dart levy.8.        I conclude that it would be wrong and most dangerous to our future prospects of maintaining a yield from the levy to make theproposed concession.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.23rd March, I960-2-C CONFIDENTIAL
