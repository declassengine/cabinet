2CONFIDENTIALReactions ] -&apos;;        ;;6. There has not yet been a considered professional reaction to the Report,but the medical profession will have mixed feelings and the dentists are considerablydisappointed. For the Government there is a unique opportunity of restoringand maintaining harmonious relationships with the professions.Proposed Basis for Negotiation7. The Wages Policy Committee endorsed the proposal of the Health ministers that negotiations with the professions should be opened on the basis of a &quot; packagedeal &quot;. We would tell the medical profession that provided that they accept theCommission^ recommendations as a whole (i.e., both those for hospital doctors and those for general medical practitioners) as they stand, the Government are-prepared to do likewise; and that we are ready at once to begin working out withthem the detailed proposals for implementation on this basis. There would be asimilar &quot; package &quot; proposal for the hospital dentists and general dental practitionerstogether.8. The package deal should include certain matters of interpretation ofconsequential which do not depart from the Report. There should be changes inthe distribution of the general practitioners&apos; pool: these would be designed to bringabout an improvement in the standard of service to the public (see paragraph 9below). The charges for board and lodging for hospital doctors and dentists shouldalso be renegotiated, but the Committee were not wholly agreed that the proposed increase in general remuneration for these classes justified a reduction in the element of subsidy contained in the present charges. I propose to discuss this matter further with the Ministers concerned.Distribution of General Practitioners&apos; Pool9. The increase of pay ought to be accompanied by improvements of service,and to this end the following changes in distribution will be discussed:. . (a) Increased pay for doctors undertaking maternity work who satisfy specified- .      requirements as to training and experience.(b) Relatively more pay for doctors having higher qualifications, and greaterexperience generally.(c) Reduction in the maximum number of patients who can be on one doctor&apos;slist (at present 3,500). A separate memorandum on this has beensubmitted (C. (60) 55).As these discussions will take time, interim distribution arrangements might benecessary.Review Body10. Agreement to the establishment of the Standing Review Body is an integral. part of the package deal and a matter to which the professions attach great importance. The Report recommends that (a) the Review Body itself should normally initiate consideration of possible changes in remuneration, but atrelatively infrequent intervals (e.g., not less than three years); (b) the changesrecommended should not contain any element of retrospection; (c) the deliberationsof the Review Body should be in private; (d) its recommendations should not. be formally binding on the Government.11. The only recommendation concerning the Review Body which the wages policy Committee agreed the Government should not accept was the proposal thatthe Inland Revenue should furnish the Review Body with information aboutearnings in the various professions. Apart from serious practical difficulties whichthere are in this proposal, it is a cardinal principle that information supplied by the tax-payer to the Inland Revenue is strictly confidential and should notbe used for other purposes. We consider that the necessary information couldbe obtained through sample enquiries and that the Government should offer to helpin the application of this method.Timetable12. It is important to open negotiations at a very early date, before the professions get themselves committed to an attitude on the Report which might make it difficult for us to negotiate on the lines proposed.  In private exchanges
before publication of the Report, the Health Ministers made the suggestion thata first meeting should take place within two-three weeks after publication, pendingwhich they hoped no rigid public stand would be taken by the professions. Theyhave already written to the leaders of the professions saying they hope soon to bein a position to arrange a meeting.13. Once the broad line can be agreed, some months of very detailed negotiations will be necessary to work out the distribution of the increased sums,including the retrospective payments, proposed. Whatever the leaders of the professions accept provisionally in these negotiations will have to be ratified bytheir appropriate representative bodies. The general medical practitionerrepresentative body meets in June and it is unlikely that the detailed negotiations could in any event be completed before then.14. Once instructions have been given, the clerical task of working out the sums actually due to individuals will be enormous and it seems unlikely that theincreased payments could be made before September.Repercussions15. Acceptance of the Royal Commission^ recommended pay increases for doctors and dentists will be bound to affect the pay of medical grades at the universities and, in consequence, the salaries of the medical and scientific staffof the Medical Research Council. There will also be some reaction on the pay ofthe Civil Service Medical Officer Class.  All this will increase the cost.16. The Wages Policy Committee recognised that acceptance of the RoyalCommission^ recommendation concerning retrospective payments totalling  20millions to cover the period back to the time when the Commission was appointed,i.e., March 1957, could have an undesirable effect on the course of the negotiationswith the railway unions following the report of the Guillebaud Committee.Nevertheless, we do not feel that the Commission^ recommendations on this mattercan be rejected, since their terms of reference specifically asked them to assess theproper current levels of remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National health service at the time the Commission was appointed.Summary17. The Wages Policy Committee endorse the proposal of the health ministers that negotiations should be opened as soon as possible with the medical and dental professions respectively on the basis of &quot; package &quot; acceptance of theRoyal Commission^ recommendations, subject to:(a) The stipulations mentioned in paragraph 8.(b) The point made in paragraph 11 about the Review Body.We now seek the approval of the Cabinet to this course.D.

annex summary OF THE report note. Not all the separate detailed recommendations are mentioned in thisSummary.GeneralThe Commission^ recommendations are based on comparison with the earnings of other professions as revealed in the survey figures printed in the Report.Comparative Career Earnings 1955-56.....2.   (Paragraph 121). The figures to which the Commission attach thegreatest importance are those of total career earnings of the average member ofcertain professional groups between ages 30 and 65 which, as set out in thefollowing table, relate to 1955-56:ProfessionMedical-General medical practitioners ...ConsultantsSenior hospital medical officersGeneral medical servicesHospital doctors ...      ......All National Health Service doctorsTotal earningsage 30-65 79,000117,00073,00076,000100,00084,000Dental-General dental practitionersGeneral dental service ...79,00078,000Others-AccountantsActuaries..........Barristers.........Advocates        ...      ....Solicitors (England and Wales)Solicitors (Scotland)ArchitectsSurveyorsEngineersUniversity teachersGraduates in industry71,000105,00092,00072,00088,00067,00054,00063,00059,00063,00084,000Career Earnings Recommended for National Health Service Doctors and Dentistsfrom 19603. (Paragraph 170).-The Commission think that in 1957 doctors and dentistsought each to have been getting , 7,000 more than the figures shown on the abovetable. For 1960 they recommend that there should be such rates of pay as will produce career earnings from all sources of:(d) About  102,000 for.National Health Service.doctors.(b) About  96,000 for general dental practitioners.Their specific recommendations are designed to produce this result.
Hospital Doctors and DentistsRecommended New Scales of Annual Remuneration compared with Present4.   (Paragraph 102). ConsultantsSenior hospital medical and dental officersSenior registrars......Registrars.........Junior   hospital   medicalofficersSenior house officersHouse officers    ......Present scales 2,293 to  3,385 1,720 to  2,211 1,258 to  1,601 972 to  1,104 887 to  1,230 852 486to  600Recommended scales 2,550 to  3,900 2,000 to  2,700 1,500 to  1,800 for the normalperiod but rising to  2,100 for those who remain nine years inthe grade 1,250 to  1,400 1,100 to  1,580 1,050 to  1,100 according to age 675 to  825Distinction Awards for Consultants5. (Paragraphs 231 to 234). Distinction awards for consultants are paid at present to 34 per cent, of all Consultants as additional salary. The Commissionrecommends:(a) Increases in the value of all the awards.  (They have not previously been increased since the beginning of the Health Service.)(b) The superimposition of a new higher award for the hundred bestconsultants.(c) Limitation of the awards to a fixed number instead of to percentage ofall consultants.6.   Their proposals compare with the present situation as follows:Grade of awardA plus a   ......b   ...C   ...Current values anddistributionNone* 2,500 per annum for 4 per cent, ofall consultants,i.e., 322 in 1959* 1,500 per annum for 10 per cent, ofall consultants,i.e., 805 in 1959 500 per annum for20 per cent, of allconsultants, i.e.,1,610 in 1959Proposals 4,000 per annum for 100 consultants 3,000 per annum for 300 consultants 1,750 per annum for 800 consultants 750 per annum for 1,600 consultants* Consultants with A and b awards have since 1954 had their annual salaries abated by 300 and  200 respectively, in effect reducing the value of their awards.Reduction or Abolition of Weighting for Part-time Senior Staffs7. (Paragraph 209). Part-time consultants, Senior Hospital Medical Officersand Senior Hospital Dental Officers are at present paid more than the straightproportion of the full-time rate. The Commission recommend that this&quot; weighting &quot; be abolished for staff appointed in the future and reduced for existing staff as follows:Present weighting6-25 per cent.Weighting recommended for those in post3-15 per cent.Weighting recommended for future appointmentsNilOther Matters8.   Among other recommendations for hospital doctors and dentists are:(a) (Paragraph 293).-Peripheral Hospitals-Hospitals away from teachingcentres should be allowed to pay up to  100 a year extra in order to recruit suitable registrars, junior hospital medical officers, senior houseofficers and house officers.
(b) (Paragraph  282). Medical  Superintendents  of  Mental  and  mental deficiency Hospitals. The Commission recommend a payment of.    250 a year in addition to other salary and any distinction award held.(c) (Paragraph 294). Board and Lodging Charges. A new scheme of charges for board and lodging should be formulated which should have regardto whether individuals or classes of individuals are obliged to live in.General Medical Practitioners ,9.   The main recommendations are:(a) (Paragraph 339). An increase in average net remuneration distributedthrough a Central Pool:Existing average Proposed new average net remuneration net remuneration 2,426 a year including Ex-  2,425 a year excluding Ex-chequer Superannuation chequer SuperannuationContributions and pri- Contributions and pri-vate earnings vate earningsAfter allowing for changes in the method of calculation the average net increase proposed is equivalent to about  260 a year.(b) (Paragraph 342). Distribution of the increased sums to be agreed betweenthe Health Departments and the profession.(c) (Paragraph 336). Interest free loans for the encouragement of grouppractice should in future be provided directly by the Exchequer and notthrough the Pool.(d) (Paragraphs 345 to 351). Differential Payments totalling  500,000 a year over and above the cost of the other recommendations should be madeavailable if a scheme for rewarding distinguished general practice canbe agreed between the profession and the Government, Until such ascheme is agreed to the money reverts permanently to the Exchequer.(e) (Paragraph 357). Trainee Assistants should receive an increase from  858to  1,150 a year.General Dental PractitionersRecommended Average Net Remuneration10. (Paragraph 390). The main recommendation is that dentists shouldreceive an average net income of  2,500 a year (excluding ExchequerSuperannuation contributions) from the general dental services, excluding earnings from private practice and other Health Service sources. This recommendationassumes continuance of the present number of hours of work of the average dentist.11. (Paragraphs 366 and 381). Payment is on an items of service basis and asa result of speedier techniques it appears that dentists may already be earning the recommended net average income. Accordingly the Commission recommend thatno change of rates should be made until a Dental Rates Study Group has been setup and got to work.Dental Rates Study Group12.   The functions of this proposed body would be to:(a) (Paragraphs 385 to 388). Ascertain continuously, on work study lines,the time an average dentist could reasonably take over each item ofservice.(b) Ascertain average hours worked.(c) (Paragraphs 385 to 388). Fix fees which will give the intended net income to a dentist working the average number of hours and putting theaverage number of jobs into an hour.(d) See how this works out in actual incomes and make any necessaryrevisions of fees if the target income is not hit.The Study Group will not be concerned to lay down or vary the average net income. Any change in future from the recommended  2,500 would be a matter forthe Review Body (see paragraphs 15 to 17 below).
The Study Group would consist mainly of representatives, of the dentalprofession and the Health Departments, but would include persons highly qualifiedin work study techniques and have a layman of authority as chairman.Other MattersStability _.....v.    .  ,        , ...13.   (Paragraph 399). Provided there are no pronounced alterations incurrent economic circumstances and trends, the recommendations apply for thethree years from 1 st January, 1960.Retrospective Payments14. (Paragraphs 395 to 398). While they consider retrospective paymentsinappropriate in principle, the Commission, having regard to the fact that theywere asked to recommend current levels in 1957 but have been unable to reportuntil 1960, recommend the distribution of lump sums of: 11 millions to general medical practitioners, and 9 millions to hospital doctors and hospital dentistsin accordance with schemes to be agreed between the Health Departments andthe profession.Review Machinery., ,15. (Paragraphs 427. to 430). While leaving minor matters to be negotiatedthrough existing machinery the Report proposes a new Review Body, similar tothe Committee on the Remuneration of the Higher Civil Service under theChairmanship of Lord Coleraine, for major issues, i.e., notably the establishment ofnew general levels of remuneration. The Body should be appointed by and advisory to the Government, and consist of a chairman and six other members,all of whom should be persons of eminence and authority, but not members of themedical or dental profession. The chairman should devote considerable time tothe work and might have to be highly paid.16. (Paragraph 449). The Review Body should be supplied with statistics of earnings in other professions by the Board of Inland Revenue. It should keep theposition under constant survey and should normally initiate reviews and offeradvice on its own initiative. It could also, however, be asked for recommendations by the Government or by the professions though only through the Government., 17. (Paragraphs 436 and 14). The Government must reserve the right to disregard the Body&apos;s recommendations but in practice should hardly ever do so and only for the most compelling reasons.Memorandum of Dissent18, . (Page 183), Professor John Jev/kes has not signed the report. In his memorandum of dissent he recommends:(a) The average annual net remuneration of General Medical Practitionersshould be  2,550 and not  2,425 as recommended by the majority.(b) Part-time consultants, senior hospital medical officers and senior hospitaldental officers should have the same &quot; weighting &quot; of their remuneration.      as., now.   \, ......i . - i   &apos;     ,(c) The only change,in distinction awards for consultants should be a straightincrease of 30 per cent, in the rates of each.(d) There should be no back-pay.    t .   .. ....... ,(e) In place of the recommended.
