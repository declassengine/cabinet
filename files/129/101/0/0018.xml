Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1960C. (60) 68 Copy No.    5 320th April, 1960CABINETTOMATOES: APPLICATION FOR TARIFF increases memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have discussed a report by the Tariff AdvisoryCommittee on an application from the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.Us.) andothers.for increased import duties on fresh tomatoes, but were unable to reach agreement. A summary of the views of the Committee is set out in paragraph 6.I how seek the views of the Cabinet on the courses open to us.background. In 1957 the N.F.U. arid the Tomato and Cucumber Marketing Boardmade two applications for increases in the duties on tomatoes and, after prolongedconsideration, the Cabinet rejected these applications iri January 1959(C.C. (59) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2). In November 1959, the N.F.Us. and othersapplied for a duty of 6d. per lb. on fresh tomatoes from 16th May to 31st August.The existing duties and the recommendations of officials are as follows:Existing Duty    RecommendationFrom 16th May-31st May:(a) Of a value exceeding Is. 3d.per lb......    ......      4d. per lb. 6d. per lb.(b) Other        ...      ......      10 per cent, ad        No changevaloremFrom 1st June-15th June ...      ...      4d. per lb. 6d. per lb.From 16th June-T5th July......      4d. per lb. 5d. per lb.From 16th Jufy-31st August       ...      4d. per lb. No change the Tariff Advisory Committee consider that the recommended increases should be reviewed after three seasons and that the onus of establishing a case forthe continuance of the increases should then rest on the industry.3. Since 1957 Dutch tomatoes have obtained a substantially increased shareof the home market in the second half of May and in June: last year Dutchtomatoes formed 27-3 per cent, of the total quantity of tomatoes marketed inthe United Kingdom in the last fortnight of May and 23-5 per cent, of the total quantity marketed in June. But Dutch tomatoes have shown no tendency toincrease their share of the market in the period from the middle of July to the endof August. Since 1957 there has also been a further contraction of tomato growingin Great Britain, and it seems reasonably clear that net incomes of tomato growershave fallen and are still falling, although the income and cost data provided by the applicants were not adequate to support any precise conclusions.56896
The Arguments For and Against an Increased Tariff4.   The main arguments in favour of an increased tariff are (a) Dutch imports have increased substantially in the early part of the seasonand are likely to continue increasing if nothing is done, with a consequent depressing effect on prices. It is reasonably clear that netincomes of our growers have been falling and that this is attributable to the increase in imports, which is particularly serious since UnitedKingdom and Guernsey growers with heated glasshouses need to obtainadequate returns early in the season to compensate for the normalfall in prices later in the summer.(b) The present duty of 4d. per lb. is a lower proportion of the price in theearly part of the season than it is later when prices have fallen, and this may be one cause of the pressure from Dutch imports in May and June.(c) The ad valorem incidence of a 6d. per lb. duty now would be less thanthat of the pre-war duty of 2d. per lb.(d) An increase in duty for a limited period would give the less competitiveof our growers a breathing space to increase their competitiveness by taking advantage of new techniques, of the improvement grants providedby the Horticulture Bill and of the compulsory grading scheme whichmay be promoted by the Tomato and Cucumber Marketing Board.(e) The present tariff application is a very sensitive political issue.  Our PartyManifesto said &quot; We shall continue to use the tariff as the maininstrument of protection &quot;. The current application, put in soon afterthe election, is regarded as a test case both by our supporters in theHouse and by the horticultural industry. Yet another rejection wouldshake belief in our pledges.(/) The United Kingdom Government also have responsibilities towards the. Channel Islands. Guernsey growers are particularly dependent onadequate returns early in the season. They have to bear even heaviertransport charges than the Dutch because all their fuel is imported andtheir tomatoes are exported by sea. Despite efforts to improve efficiencytheir income too has been falling as the Dutch share of the early markethas risen.  This trend affects the whole economy of Guernsey.5.   The main arguments against an increased tariff are (i) Although the level of Dutch wages is somewhat lower than that in theUnited Kingdom this is offset by the existing tariff and transport charges; the other competitive advantages of the Dutch arise not fromany natural conditions but from the better organisation and greater efficiency of their horticultural industry.(ii) Our tomato growers should protect themselves by matching the efficiency of continental producers rather than by seeking to increase tariffs thatare already high. An increased tariff might merely relieve the pressure on them to become more efficient.(iii) The main tomato growing area in Great Britain is in the Lea Valley;the economic difficulties of growers here may be partly due to airpollution in this relatively urban area, as reflected in low yields per acre by many producers there, and to the competition for labour withneighbouring factories; tariff increases should not be used to maintainsuch uneconomic production.(iv) An increased tariff might result in higher retail prices and a smallerdemand for tomatoes.(v) The political difficulty of impressing on the horticultural industry theneed to become competitive with imports is likely to be less now thanit would be later.(vi) An increased tariff would damage our overseas trading relations, and inthe case of the Dutch in particular, who are our best friends amongthe Six and who are the only foreign suppliers to be affected by the recommended tariff increases, it would have a serious effect on political relations; this may make it more difficult to reach a solution to our trade problems in Europe.
Summary of the Committee&apos;s Views6. Most of the Committee considered that the balance of the arguments was against an increase in the tariff. The Ministers with responsibilities for agricultureand for the Channel Islands, however, stressed the political importance of thetariff application and the almost complete dependence of Guernsey&apos;s economyon the tomato industry. They considered that the tariff should be increased by not less than the official recommendation. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministryof Agriculture, considered that a tariff of 5d. per lb. should apply from 16th june to the end of July and not merely until 15th July as recommended by officials.Some other Ministers suggested that if the tariff were to be increased there shouldbe a clear provision for the termination of the increases after a given period, since this would more effectively discourage any expansion of high cost tomatoproduction than the official recommendation that the increase in duty should be reviewed after three years.7. Should the decision be to increase the tariff, there would not be time to go through the procedures laid down for invoking the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (GATT) preference waiver if the increases are to operate from the middleof May. We could say that in spirit the waiver conditions were satisfied but weshould be procedurally wrong. The Foreign Secretary considers that this wouldbe taken badly by the Dutch and would provide an opportunity for criticism inthe GATT of which they would no doubt take full advantage.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,14th April, I960.
