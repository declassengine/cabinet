PENSIONS:   TIMING OF NEXT MOVEMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance the questions for decision aret-(i)    The timing of the legislation to increase national insurance benefits and contributions.(ii)    The timing of the operation of these changes.2. For practical purposes the choice seems to me to lie between two alternatives.    These are;-Plan 1Legislation - June/July, I96 0.Operation - November/December, I960 (i.e., before christmas ).Plan 2Legislation - November/December, I960.Operation - early April, 196(8, (i. e. , contemporaneouslywith the introduction of graduated contributions).The third possibility mentioned in the Lord Chancellor&apos;s paper(C.(60) 79) of an increase delayed until 1961-62 does not seem to be a practicable one in the light of our pledges.    I ought to make it clear thatif legislation were delayed until some time after April, 1961, it would notbe possible to put the benefits into payment until 1962.3.      The arguments in favour of Plan 1 are:-(i)    We could claim to be fulfilling our Election pledge to let the old people have a share in the rising prosperity of the country.(ii)    Public opinion attaches substantial importance to improving the financial position of old people beforethe worst of the winter sets in and, sentimentally,before Christmas.-1-A(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 80 COPY NO.   j 39th May, I960CABINET
(iii)    I have a statutory duty under Section 40 of the national insurance Act, 1946, to &quot;review the rates and amounts of benefit in relation: -(a) to the circumstances at the time of insured personsin Great Britain, including in particular theexpenditure which is necessary for the preservation-tion of health and working capacity;   and(b) to any changes in those circumstances since therates and amounts of benefit were laid down bythis Act or any Act  amending it and to the likelihood-hood of future changes&quot;.This review, which will have to say whether in relation tothese considerations there is a case for raising benefitscan hardly be postponed beyond mid-summer.    TheGovernment Actuaryrs report to the Treasury on hisquinquennial review of the finances of the scheme underSection 39 of the Act, on the laying of which beforeParliament my statutory duty arises, was signed on27th April and I understand that, if printing takes itsordinary course, it will be ready for publication byabout the end of this month.    On the last occasion in1954 it was laid a fortnight after signature and mypredecessor1 s report was laid on the following day.(iv)    In the light of the change to graduated contributions, the increases in national insurance contributions, and soin benefits, which it is practicable to make on this occasion can, at best, be only moderate in scale;  the relevant figures are set out at paragraph 8.     Publicacceptance of such modest benefit increases will be increasingly difficult to secure if they are delayedfurther.(v)    Postponement of the introduction of legislation beyondthe summer recess will give rise to great publicpressures.    As a consequence, changes whenintroduced would appear to have been extracted by pressure rather than given on our own initiative.(vi)    From the point of view of preventing changes in national insurance being used to build up pressure for a postponement of the introduction of graduated contributions under the Act of 1959, it is desirablethat changes be announced as long as possible before April,  1961.4.      The arguments in favour of Plan 2 are as follows:-
(i)    In the light of the changes due to take place in April, 1961,it would be difficult and embarrassing to raise thepresent flat-rate contribution, already acknowledgedto be high in respect of the lower-paid worker, to ahigher figure for a few months and then to reduce itsomewhat in April, 1961.     Postponement of thechange until April, 1961, would remove the dilemmaof either doing this, or finding an alternative interimmethod of financing increased rates of benefit.(ii) The latest cost-of-living figure is only two points above that ruling in January, 1958, when benefits were fixed at their present level.(iii)    Though pressure to make an increase will undoubtedly be heavy this summer, with the probability of some ofour own Members of Parliament supporting it, thereis no reason as yet to believe that, although damaging,it will be absolutely irresistible.5.     It is the interim financing of the increases which, as the LordChancellor&apos;s paper brings out, is the most important problem of Plan 1.We must hold firmly to the general principle that increases in benefitsmust be matched by higher contributions.    It has, however, been widelyacknowledged that the present contributions are just about as high inrelation to present earnings as can be tolerated in a flat-rate scheme, andat the General Election we took some credit for the fact that the 1959 Actwould mean a reduction in contributions for the lower-paid worker fromnext April.    Benefit increases on the scale contemplated could be financed from April next year by retaining the present contribution as theminimum contribution under the new scheme.    I think that, with wagesincreasing, this would generally be accepted as a fair price for higherbenefits.    But I am sure it would be very difficult to gain acceptancefor a proposal actually to increase contributions for a few months tosome 15 per cent above their present level so as to finance increasedbenefits pending the introduction of the new scheme.    If the benefit increases come into force in mid-December, as they might reasonablydo if not linked with contribution changes, the extra amount needed to finance them until next April would be about  35 millions.    It would be pointed out that the National Insurance Funds hold securities of over 1,450 millions from which the money could be found to bridge the gap andthat the Funds are already being run down to the tune of about  50 millions this year to save the Exchequer from having to meet the full deficiencywhich will arise until the graduated scheme comes into force.    If, there-fore, we decide that policy and the pledge require us to increase thenational insurance benefits before the end of I960, it will be verydifficult to satisfy Parliament (including our own supporters) and thecountry that on this unique occasion (i. e. , pending the introduction of graduated contributions) these increases could not be financedtemporarily by drawing on the Fund for a further three months ratherthan resort to a temporary increase in the flat-rate contribution beyondthe level hitherto regarded as tolerable for the lower-paid workers.It would be said that this is just the sort of temporary situation for whichthe Funds exist.    It is also worth noting in this connection that the
introduction of the new graduated contributions in April, 1961 entails agreat deal of extra work and trouble for employers which they certainlyresent ;  and to inflict considerable further work on them by a doublechange of rates within this particular few months would give rise to serious criticism.     This would be the more serious if, as may well be,a temporary increase of this kind was generally regarded as unwarranted.Though I do not underrate its importance, I am inclined to think thatthe reference in paragraph 6(a) of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s paper to &quot;great&quot;financial difficulties in this connection is overstated.    What is involved isa once-for-all payment of  35 millions at the end of 1960-61 in respectof which various devices are possible to avoid the burden falling on Votes.This sum compares with the saving of some  65 millions in 1961-62 whichwill result to the Exchequer from the coming into operation of theNational Insurance Act, 1959.6.     In my own view, what is the right course is a question of politicaljudgment.    Although we have firmly resisted any precise undertaking toincrease benefit rates by any particular figure at any particular date, wehave created an expectation that an improvement will be coming soon.Indeed my major anxiety is whether, whenever announced, the particularimprovements which we have in mind may not be thought to be less thanadequate, as they will certainly be less than expected.    It is materialthat our recent statements of policy have departed from the old basis of considering rates of benefit pretty closely in relation to changes in thecost of living - on which basis our position would at present be fairlysound - and have introduced the new concept of a share for the old inthe increasing prosperity of the nation.     This new concept has a profoundappeal, particularly to that section of our population which feels someuneasiness of conscience when it contrasts the very high levels of consumption of the working population with that of older people whoseincome from public sources is, in real terms, only a matter of a fewshillings a week above what was thought right in the very difficultcircumstances which existed immediately after the war.    No precisedefinition of what is the criterion of increasing prosperity has been laiddown.     The most obvious test is that of earnings of industrial workers.Since January, 19 58, when the present rates of national insurance benefitcame into operation, earnings of male industrial workers have risen byl\ per cent and of women by Qj per cent.    These figures relate to october, 19 59, and will clearly have risen further before November, I960,which is the earliest date from which pension changes can now operate.But even as at October, 19 59, a mere application of the same percentage increase to the basic level of retirement pensions wouldinvolve an increase of about 3s. 9d. in the 50s. pension, and thefigure may be nearly double that by the time any such change will be operating.     Tho danger, it seems to me, if we postpone pension changesuntil April, 1961 - eighteen months after the Election - is not only thatthe delay may be thought not to be consistent with the expectations  wehave raised, but also that the amount of the changes, which seem modestenough now, will then seem quite inadequate.     We are not here in thefield of precise, logic, nor can we therefore hope to combat loss of faith and confidsnce in us by precisely logical argument.    It may wellbe that public opinion in general and the pensioner in particular readinto our policy statements and speeches last autumn more than, on ananalytical consideration, they will bear.     But if, as I fear, those
those statements did create an expectation, frustration of that expectationcould do the Government and the Party immeasurable long-term harm.I annex a number of statements which have been made on pensions.7.     In our consideration of the problem of giving to the pensioner ashare in increasing prosperity it is helpful to note what is said in themost recent assessment of the economic situation which was circulated bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Economic Policy Committee.The report by the Economic Section of the Treasury appended to the notestated that, apart from the effect of recent wage settlements, &quot;a large increase in money incomes has certainly been taking place&quot; during theearly months of this year.    Some rise in prices is also forecast, apartfrom the fact that the increase in tobacco duty in the Budget will raisethe Index figure by two-fifths of a point.    These facts were not of courseavailable when the Social Services Committee, the majority view of whichis given in the Lord Chancellor&apos;s paper, considered this question at theend of February.8.      The immediate question to be decided is whether legislation forincreased benefits should be carried through this summer or next session,and with this is linked the method of financing the increases until next april if they are to come into force before Christmas.    If the decision is in favour of summer legislation, then we shall next need a very early decision about the structure of benefit improvements to be made.    Asparagraph 5 of the Lord Chancellor^ paper indicates, the Social services committee have had tinder consideration three possible schemes which,at their request, have now been worked out in detail with the Treasury.They are:-(i)    A general increase of 6s. (single) and 10s. (married) inthe standard rates with proportionate increases inmost other rates, but rather more for widows&apos;children.(ii)    A general increase of 5s. (single) and 7s. 6d. (married)together with an extra addition of 4s. 6d. or 5s.(single) and 7s. 6d. (married) for pensioners over 70,with again better than proportionate increases for widows&apos; children.(iii)    No general increase but a big increase (about 15s. single)for pensioners over 70.It may be noted, that the Labour Party bid was for an immediate general increase of 10s, (single) with no extra for a married couple, and thishas set the level of public expectation.    To some extent sentiment infavour of scheme (ii) above, with its bigger increase for the over-seventies,for which there is a respectable case on social grounds, has been influenced by a feeling that general increases of no more than 10s. for a married couple and 6s. for a single person would be a bitter disappointmenteven if promptly introduced.    There is no doubt that they would beregarded as totally inadequate if they were withheld until April, 1961 -18 months after the Election - with no prospect of further increases for another two or three years.
9.      On this question of the timing and cost of a move on national insurance, the effect on national assistance also requires consideration.It is now accepted on all sides, and strongly held by the Chairman ofthe National Assistance Board, that whenever we increase national insurance benefits we must at the same time increase national assistance -though not necessarily to the same extent - to ensure that thosepensioners with national assistance supplements get something.     But,if the national insurance increases are delayed till April, 1961, we may still be compelled to increase national assistance before the onset of next winter, and then again in April.    This would mean two increases in national assistance within a short period and the sum of these twoincreases (even if the first one were quite meagre) might well be larger and more costly to the Exchequer than one increase synchronous with anational insurance increase before the end of I960.10.    I invite the Cabinet to consider whether we should not proceedforthwith with legislation to be carried through Parliament this summer.J. A. B. -C.Ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W.C.2.6th May, I960.ANNEXSTATEMENTS MADE ON PENSIONS&quot;The rates of retirement pensions, which we have increased three times, have now a real buying power over ten shillings higher than in1951.     We pledge ourselves to ensure that pensioners continue to share inthe good things which a steadily expanding economy will bring. &quot;(Conservative Election Manifesto)&quot;To-day the value of the pension is ten shillings higher in purchasingpower than it has ever been.    And that&apos;s deeds not just words.    It means that we have made a start on doing something all of us want - to give the pensioner a share, and a fair share, in the increasing prosperity of thecountry.    Ana I give you this pledge, this personal pledge:  In the nextParliament we shall go on doing it. &quot;(Prime Minister&apos;s television broad-cast, 6th October, 1959)
&quot;Under our policy since 1951, pensioners and other beneficiarieshave not only had the purchasing power of their benefits maintained butshared in the increase of the national prosperity.     This remains a keyfeature in our policy and we intend to ensure that as our prosperityincreases pensioners and others will continue to have a share.&quot;(Chancellor of the Exchequer, Debate onthe Address, 3rd November, 1959)&quot;I believe the public realised that the pledge we gave during theElection was an undertaking to old-age pensioners, not only that wewould maintain their rate of pension in relation to the cost of living, whichwe have done up to date - and more -but also that they would take their share in the rising prosperity of the country, which could be assured only by the pursuance of Conservative policies and by the continuance of the betterment which we have brought about.    I believe that that impressedthe people and that certainly is the policy which we intend to pursue inthis Government. &quot;(Home Secretary, Debate on the address, 3rd November, 1959)&quot;We want to see expanded wealth in which all sections of thecommunity share.    We have given a pledge to the old-age pensioners inthis respect and we intend to keep it. &quot;(Prime Ministers New Year message to the Conservative Party,1st January, I960 )&quot;.....the Government intend to keep their pledge about retire-ment pensions.    Our Election pledge was perfectly clear.     We said thatwe would ensure that pensioners would continue to share in the risingprosperity of the nation.    Our record on pensions is a good one, asthe electorate realised, and we can be trusted to see that that recordis maintained. 11(Chancellor of the Exchequer,Budget Debate, 7th April, I960)-7-
