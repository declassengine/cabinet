oSECRET58(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(60) 6225th March, I960LICENSED MINESMemorandum by the Minister of power on 25th March the Home Affairs Committee discussed the difficult situation which has arisen from the proposals of the national coal Board to reduce the output of the small, licensed mines.   Two-thirds of all the licences which the Board issue under Section 36 of the1946 Nationalisation Act are currently due for renewal.   Under the act the Board have the power to attach conditions to the issue of theselicences.2. The Board feel that the quotas of output which they have proposed are justified because the alternative is further stocking of coal bysome of the Board!s own mines, and probably some more closures.The Federation of Small Mines think the reduction too harsh.3.        In the course of six conversations I have had with the Chairmanof the Board, he has agreed to make improved offers which at an earlier stage would almost certainly have led to a settlement.   TheFederation^ attitude has undoubtedly been stiffened by offers ofpolitical support and a settlement, even on the basis of the improvedoffers, now seems remote.4.        The Chairman of the Board was anxious that I should speak tothe Federation before he renewed negotiations with them, in the hopethat this would enhance the likelihood of an agreed settlement.   TheHome Affairs Committee were overwhelmingly of the view that Ishould not do so, but should impress upon the Chairman of the board the urgent importance of his settling this problem.   I have conveyedthis to the Chairman and expect that negotiations will be resumednext week.   I will report to the Cabinet the result of these negotations.In the event of their not being successful I should have to consider what further action I could usefully take.R. F.
