Printed for the Cabinet.  June I960C. (60) 9231st May, 1960Copy No.   JCABINETGRANTS TO STUDENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof education the report of the Committee on Grants to Students under the chairmanship of Sir Colin Anderson is to he published on Thursday, 2nd June. There is a numberof Parliamentary Questions on it, to be answered on the same day. The prospect ofthe report has already aroused wide public interest and we cannot avoid sayingsomething.2. The Committee on Education Policy have given some preliminary consideration to the principal recommendations in the report. These raise majorfinancial, administrative and political issues, which we shall need time to decide.Some of them we cannot decide until we have consulted the universities, the localauthorities and the schools. A purely holding statement, on the lines of the draft annexed, seems, therefore the right course.3. The majority of the Anderson Committee recommended the abolition ofthe parental means test, together with the abolition of the tax allowance in respectof any student receiving an award. This would mean a substantial charge on public funds, though the cost would not be great in relation to the whole cost ofeducation. The minority recommendation favoured retention of the means testbut in a form more generous than at present. But the Education Policy Committeeare satisfied that the difference in cost, as shown in the following table, would not justify retaining the administrative machinery and incurring the criticism which the minority recommendation would involve.University awardsGrants to studentsin teacher training colleges, &amp;c.   ...Total1958-59Cost on Additional costpresent of recommendations:basis majority I minority millions  millions  millions17 54 Ah22 539 lOiCost onpresentbasis  millions2938671969-70Additional costof recommendations:majority /minority  millions   millions9i514i7i5mIf we are going to retain the means test at all, it should clearly be substantiallystricter than the minority recommend.4. The second major recommendation is that all students of a certaineducational standard who are accepted by a university or for an equivalent course should receive an award from public funds. This would have the great advantageof securing uniformity of grant administration throughout the United Kingdom butraises several very difficult problems.
2CONFIDENTIAL5. First is the question of selection for awards. The effect of therecommendation would be to put selection entirely into the hands of theuniversities, leaving the local authorities no discretion; and thus to focus a newkind of attention on thefadtnissjon procedures of the universities, which are alreadyhaving a damaging effect on the pattern of education at a time of shortage ofuniversity places.6. Secondly it raises the question of central or local responsibility fpr payingttie Waras^^lhe recommendation were accepted and if the parental means test(with its administrative background) were abolished, the local authorities wouldbe left with no function at all but to pay. This they would not accept and it followsthat the function of making the awards and the whole cost of them would have to betransferred to the central Government.7. These and other important issues raised by the Anderson report will needto be further considered. Meanwhile, we invite the Cabinet to agree to thestatement as drafted, which leaves it in no doubt that the proposed consultationswill not include the question of the means test.J. S.
