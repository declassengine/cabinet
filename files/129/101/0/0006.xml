m ifi!(.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 56 COPY NO.      ^21st March, I960CABINETMANUFACTURE OF DART ENGINES IN india memorandum by the Minister of AviationRolls-Royce Limited recently concluded an agreement with theIndian Government for the manufacture of Dart Engines in India.   Rolls-Royce are to receive about  1 million,   paid in instalments overfifteen years.   Of this, the United Kingdom Government are entitledto receive a levy of about  280,000, spread over the same period.2.        The amount paid to British manufacturers for licences to manufacture aircraft and aero-engines overseas is subject to negotiationin each case.   The amount of the levy payable to the Government, inrespect of either the sale of aircraft and engines, or licences for production abroad, depends uponthe extent to which the development ofthe equipment has been financed out of public funds.3.        The Government paid about  5 millions towards the developmentof the earlier marks of the Dart engine, while Rolls-Royce are payingentirely for the development of the later  marks, making a total contribution by the firm to the Dart series of about another  5 millions.Under our contract with the firm the United Kingdom Government areentitled to receive a levy of l\ per cent or 3-f per cent of the priceof each engine sold, and 33*1 per cent or 25 per cent of any licensing fees,(the percentage depending upon the mark of engine).    When the UnitedKingdom Government&apos;s total contribution has been recovered the levy onengine sales falls to 3 per cent for all marks.4.        Last September, before the agreement was   completed,Mr. Krishna Menon, the Indian Minister of Defence, approached theMinister of Supply with a request that, having regard to India&apos;sheavy expenditure on defence equipment from the United Kingdom, theGovernment should forgo its levy.   The Minister of Supply undertook toconsider this request sympathetically;   and in December the indian government signed the contract.5.        In view of India&apos;s importance as a customer to us, I asked theChancellor to agree   to our cutting the levy by 7 5 per cent (i. e. byabout  200,000).   However, he could not see his way to agree.6.        In the last few days I have received a letter from Mr. Menon press in;for a decision on this question.   He has in the past been extremely helpfuland has played a notable part in getting the Indian Government to buyBritish aircraft (for example, the Canberra and the Hunter) againstintense United States, Russian and French competition.   Moreover, theIndian Government are at present considering placing orders for other british military aircraft, worth over  30 millions.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
7.        Mr. Menon, who enjoys bazaar bargaining, clearly attachesimportance to getting his way on this point;   and having regard to theimportant orders which are in prospect, I think it is worthwhile lettinghim do so.   However, in order to preserve the principle of the levy, Ido not think we should abate it by more than 75 per cent.8.        There are a number of precedents for abating or forgoingaltogether the levy on sales of aircraft (e. g. Canberras for Indiaand Comet.s  for Egypt), though this problem has not until now arisen in connection with licence agreements.9.        In all the circumstances I hope that the Cabinet will approvemy proposal to abate the levy by 75 per cent (i . e.   200,000) spreadover fifteen years.D. S.Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.21st March, I960CONFIDENTIAL
