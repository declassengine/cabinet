secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1960C. (60) 64 Copy No.    5(J4th April, 1960CABINETIMPORTS OF PIGMEATMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have discussed a report by officials on future policy concerning imports of pigmeat and canned hams, but were unable to reach agreement. A summary of the majority views of the Committee is set out inparagraph 13. I now seek the views of the Cabinet on the various courses whichare open to us.background. The Cabinet will recall their decision on 17th November, 1959(C.C. (59) 58th Conclusions, Minute 5), to authorise imports of up to 25,000 tonsof frozen pork from North America (in effect, Canada) and to reduce supplies ofbacon from East European countries. Accordingly the Polish bacon quota forthe first half of 1960 was fixed at 20,000 tons (compared with an annual quota of48,500 tons for 1959) and no undertaking was given about the level of future quotas.3. In the event Canadian Government stocks of frozen pork have been foundto be unsuitable for use in the United Kingdom, and private North Americanexporters are not at present interested in selling frozen pork here at our prices.4. The cut imposed on bacon supplies from Poland has caused great politicalresentment there, and serious harm to United Kingdom export trade. This hasled to strong protests from United Kingdom industrialists (including the chairmen of Associated Electrical Industries Ltd. and Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.).Large orders for capital goods are being held up and orders for over  3 millions(including one of  2-5 millions for three Viscounts) are known to have been lostbecause of the fall in prospective Polish earnings of sterling. The Poles have refused to proceed with the negotiation of a new trade agreement, have askedfor a revision of the debt settlement, and have said that they must hold up orders inthis country for capital goods totalling over  12 millions until the bacon issue issettled. There is no limitation on bacon supplies from Denmark or Holland, sothat if the objective is to limit total bacon imports, it is unlikely that a cut in the quota of Poland, a minor supplier, will have any effect a shortfall in Polishsupplies can easily be made up by increased shipments from Denmark or Holland.5. Government policy on pigs and pigmeat is a sensitive issue among Britishfarmers. Their confidence has been shaken by the agreement to reduce the tariff on Danish bacon and other foodstuffs from the countries of the European free trade Association (E.F.T.A.) and they are far from satisfied about the outcome of the recent Farm Price Review, which increased the guaranteed price for pigsby 9d. a score. They are also concerned about the possibility that the concessionsmade to the E.F.T.A. will be extended to Finland if the latter joins the Association.6. If the United Kingdom market were opened too widely to supplies ofpigmeat, domestic prices would tend to fall and the cost of Exchequer supportunder the deficiency payments scheme would increase perhaps very substantially.7. The views of the Committee on the policy which we should adopt in this situation are set out in the following paragraphs.Poland8. While it was recognised that, in the absence of Canadian supplies, therewas a strong case for offering the Poles at an early date a bacon quota of 48,500tons for 1960, the majority of the Committee thought that the quota for the first half of 1960 should be left at 20,000 tons and that a quota of 24,250 tons shouldbe offered for the second half. This would restore the 1959 rate of imports from56812
Poland for the second half of 1960 but the lower total of Polish supplies over theyear would go some way to meet objections from British farmers. The foreign secretary holds the view that, in order to restore our political relations with Poland,the bacon quota for 1960 should be not less than 48,500 tons and should, if possible,be increased to 51,000 tons (the total for which the Poles have asked). The Minister^qf) Aviation shares this view.9. With some encouragement from us after the war, the Poles have developedtheir pig industry with the British market in mind and need above all an assurance that our purchases of Polish bacon will be maintained at a reasonable level over theyears during which they must pay for capital. goods purchased on long-term contracts. Most Ministers felt that we should tell the Poles when the 1960 quotawas offered that we should be prepared to offer a quota of 48,500 tons for 1961,because it would be unrealistic to offer this level for so short a period as the last six months of 1960 only. Others proposed that the assurance should take the formof a commitment to offer an annual quota for 1961 and subsequent years of notless than 40,000 tons with negotiations each year to settle the exact figure.Canada10. The Committee were of the opinion that, while there was an obligationto remove quantitative restrictions on imports of pigmeat from dollar sources,it was inopportune to take such a step at present, even though supplies of pigmeatfrom Canada would probably be negligible if the trade were freed. Most of theCommittee thought that the Canadian quota should be kept at 25,000 tons for thetime being and if the Canadians pressed for more we should consider the irrepresentations on their merits. Much would depend on whether they had begun in practice to sell over here.11. The Minister of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, has pointed outthat it was difficult to support a proposal which placed a Commonwealth country(which was a traditional supplier of our market) at a disadvantage vis-a-vis an iron curtain country. In his view, that should mean at the minimum that the Canadiansshould be given a pigmeat quota not less than that given to the Poles. This couldbe achieved by adding a quota of 25,000 tons of pigmeat to the existing quota of25,000 tons of frozen pork. To leave only the existing quota of 25,000 tons offrozen pork will not satisfy the Canadians (who cannot take advantage of it), andthey will now look for a quota for all types of pigmeat.Canned Hams12. The Committee were agreed that quantitative restrictions on imports of canned hams should be maintained for the present!, but the size of the quotas might need to be reviewed. If canned hams were freed from import restriction and canadian pigmeat were not, the British canning firms would be able to argue(however illogically) that they were being prevented from buying their raw materialsupplies while being exposed to competition from finished products.Summary of Committee&apos;s Views13.: (a) As regards 1960, the majority view was that the Polish bacon quotashould be left at 20,000 tons for the first half of the year and should beincreased to 24,250 tons for the second half. The Foreign secretary and the Minister of Aviation have reserved their positions.(b) As regards 1961, most Ministers thought that we should offer Poland atthe same time a bacon quota of 48,500 tons for that year in order tohelp our exporters secure long-term orders for capital goods. It wasalso argued that alternatively we should offer an annual quota of40,000 tons for 1961 and subsequent years with negotiations each yearto settle the figure.(c) The quota for Canadian frozen pork should be maintained at 25,000 tons,but, if the Canadians protest, we should consider their representations on their merits. The Commonwealth Secretary has reserved hisposition.(d) Quantitative restrictions on canned hams should be maintained for thetime being, but the size of quotas might need to be reviewed.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,1st April, I960.
