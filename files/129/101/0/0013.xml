SECRET5a.(THIS DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)C.(60) 63COPY NO.   jfo.28th March, I960CABINETBRITISH GUIANAMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs in constitutional talks over the past three weeks agreement has been reached on recommendations to the Cabinet which would,subject to two provisos, result in the grant of full internal self-government to the Colony at the end of the normal life of the presentLegislature (August, 1961).    The provisos are:   suitable arrangements to safeguard the rights of public servants, and agreement within thenext twelve months by the Colonial Secretary that   responsibilities inregard to police and internal security should be transferred to electedMinisters in the new Constitution.   There would then be reserved toHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, acting through theGovernor, powers only in regard to defence and external affairs(excluding external trade) and the making or amending of the Constitutionor its suspension in grave emergency.2.         At the very end of the talks the Minister of Commerce andIndustry in British Guiana, Dr. Jagan, demanded that new constitutionalinstruments should forthwith be made which would provide for thePremier now to preside in Executive Council instead of the Governor.His reasons are that the Pr emier should gain experience;   that her majesty&apos;s Government should shew trust in the political leaders,of British Guiana;  and that the territory should at once be given a status equal to Trinidad.3. Mr. Burnham, leader of the Opposition, who was associatedwith Dr. Jagan in the misdemeanours of the Government that led tothe suspension of the Constitution in 1953,  supported Dr. Jagan&apos;demands.   He probably did so believing that Dr. Jagan&apos;s  administration would get in a mess (he is right! ) and that he would reap the fruitsat the next elections.4.        I undertook to ask the Cabinet whether, despite the originalinsistence of the Colonial Secretary that the Governor should continueto preside over Executive Council at the constitutional stage following the elections of August, 1961, and his reluctant concession that at that stage the Premier should preside, an amending Order should besubmitted to Her Majesty in Council now, providing for the Premierto summon and preside over Executive Council while still reservingto the Governor discretionary right to summon and preside overmeetings if he saw fit.-1-
5.        The Colonial Secretary had previously undertaken to reportthe views of the British Guiana delegation that the leader of theGovernment under the new Constitution should be &quot;Prime Minister&quot; andnot &quot;Premier&quot; and the strong protest of the delegation at the colonial secretary&apos;s decision that it should be &quot;Premier&quot;.6.        I had also undertaken to seek the views of Ministers on therequest by the British Guiana delegation that a Bill should be passed to amend the British Guiana Act, 1928, by removing the power to legislate by Order in Council.   This request was made although theColonial Secretary had announced his willingness to affirm by Despatchthat it would not be his intention, after the introduction of the newConstitution, to advise that the power to legislate for British Guianaby Order in Council under the British Guiana Act, 1928, should be usedother than for the purpose of constitution-making or in grave emergencyThe claim of the delegation was that the continuance of this general power was derogatory to the status of british Guiana and implied alack of sincerity on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the expressed intention of leading the territory to independence, and thatthe Colony should be put in the same position in this respect as a numberof other West Indian territories in which, for historical reasons,Her Majesty no longer has a general power to legislate by Order inCouncil.Immediate Removal of the Governor from Executive Council7.        The Governor and his official advisers judge that the immediateremoval of the Governor from Executive Council, despite his retentionuntil August, 1961, of general reserved powers, would be a grave blow to public opinion in British Guiana and the United States and wouldshock overscc-s investors.    British Guiana depends almost entirely on overseas investment in sugar and the mining of bauxite andmanganese.   Dr. Jagan and his colleagues (with the possible exceptionof his communist wife, who is also a Minister) are inept administrators.The Governor   would, upon the most liberal interpretation of his responsibilities, be compelled frequently to intervene to get decisionsof Council altered, and this at best would mean much friction.    Clearlyit is undesirable that &quot;reserved powers&quot; should be used save on themost infrequent and important of occasions.   There has been no discussion either in the Legislature or in public in British Guianaof substantial constituional changes to take place earlier than the end ofthe normal life of the present Legislature, and not only has Dr. Jaganno public mandate to seek such changes but his majority is shaky.8.        I have offered instead that the title of &quot;Premier&quot; be broughtinto use at once by convention and that the Governor would liberallyconstrue the present constitutional requirement that he preside in Coun&quot;so far as is practicable&quot; and would from time to time absent himselfso that the Premier would have experience in presiding.   This was unacceptable to the delegation and if we, as I think we should for reasons given above, stand firm it may mean the breakdown of this conference.-2-SECIftET
-3-SECRET9.         I have done all that is required in reporting this demand.Amendment of British Guiana Act, 192810.       This is a request made in part because the Guianese, havingthrough their own misconduct had one Constitution suspended, arenervous of having any future Constitution suspended and in part forprestige reasons at home.   The assurance offered by the colonial secretary that he would not advise the exercise of the power save forconstitution-making or in grave emergency seems sufficient.   Thisis not a sticking point for the delegation.11.       I have consulted the Colonial Secretary by telegram andhe has replied agreeing with my views.P.Colonial Gffice, S. W. 1.28th March, I960
