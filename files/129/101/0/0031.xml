CABINETKUWAIT: THE EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT OF 1899Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe formal relationship between the United Kingdom and Kuwait is stillbased on the &quot; Exclusive Agreement&quot; of 1899 whereby the Shaikh of Kuwaitundertook on behalf of himself and his successors &quot; not to receive the Agent orRepresentative of any Power or Government at Kuwait or at any other place within the limits of his territory without the previous sanction of the BritishGovernment&quot;, and also not to part with any portion of his territory &quot; to theGovernment or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;.2. The Letter of Assurance given to the Ruler on 21st of October, 1958,recognised that the Ruler intended to &quot; deal with certain matters affecting Kuwaifsrelations with other Arab States by your own efforts to the extent that your highness considers this desirable in the interests of Kuwait&quot;, and gave our tacitapproval. Thus, in so far as the Ruler might wish to receive certain foreign representatives, the previous sanction required by the 1899 Agreement was in factgiven. However the Ruler could reasonably claim that the 1899 Agreement is inconsistent at least with the spirit of that letter.3. The 1899 Agreement is still more clearly inconsistent with the international status which Kuwait is now assuming in practice. The Cabinet considered Kuwaifsinternational status on 11th of November, 1958 (C.C. (58) 80th Conclusions,Minute 7). They agreed to my proposals about the accession of Kuwait to international organisations, and they recognised that it might consequently become necessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to state that they regarded Kuwait as fullyresponsible for the conduct of her international relations. The necessity for sucha statement did not arise until March 1960 when the eligibility of Kuwait for membership of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation waschallenged in the Council of that organisation. Although the declaration thatKuwait is responsible for the conduct of her own international relations was made only orally and at official level by the United Kingdom representative at the meetingof the Council, this declaration has now been made.4. I have been considering whether it would be wise to take the initiativewith the Ruler of Kuwait in seeking a modification of the 1899 Agreement to bring it more into accord with the spirit of the present Anglo-Kuwaiti relationship.I have concluded that it would be unwise to do so. There is at present no pressure in Kuwait for a change in the Agreement, whose very existence remains in obscurity.It would not necessarily be possible to negotiate a new written agreement of any kind, since Arab nationalist pressures would develop as soon as the attempt wasmade.5. I consider however that, if the Ruler should raise the question of revising the 1899 Agreement, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, or the PoliticalPrinted for the Cabinet.   May i960C.

Agent in Kuwait, should be empowered to say immediately, as from himself, thathe is sure that Her Majesty&apos;s Government realise the Agreement to be no longercompatible with present circumstances and would be ready to consider revising it,and that he would make a recommendation in this sense to London. I invite mycolleagues to agree that instructions in this sense should be sent to the political resident.i) (I 6. -I-should prefer to postpone, until the circumstances prevailing at the time are known, consideration of what form of agreement might be negotiated to replace the Exclusive Agreement of 1899. *rS.
