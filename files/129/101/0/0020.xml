Printed for the Cabinet.   April I960C. (60) 70 Copy No.   5319th April, 1960CABINETSALARIES OF UNIVERSITY STAFFSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Vice-Chancellors&apos; Committee and the Association of University Teachers(A.U.T.) have made representations to the University Grants Committee (U.G.C.)for salary increases to non-medical university staffs. The U.G.C. has consideredthese representations. For these purposes, the professorial members of U.G.C.withdraw, and the recommendations are made by the chairman, Sir Keith Murray,who is responsible solely to me, and the non-academic members of the Committee.2. The U.G.C. has recommended to me that increases should be made. Theexisting and proposed new scales are set out in the Annex. These recommendations,which are of course very much less than the A.U.T. were seeking, would cost 3-1 millions in a full year.3. The Wages Policy Committee have considered the proposed new scalesand the recommended differential payments to attract teachers in great demandoutside the universities, e.g., certain kinds of scientists, and, while recognising thatthese recommendations might cause some further difficulty in staffing senior posts in colleges of advanced technology, agreed that they should be accepted.Date of Implementation4. The U.G.C. have recommended strongly the acceptance of the requestof the Vice-Chancellors&apos; Committee and the Association of University Teachersthat the new scales should have effect as from 1st October, 1959, the date fromwhich comparable staffs in technical colleges (including colleges of advanced technology) in England and Wales received their last salary increases under the burnham arrangements. The U.G.C. have said that it is only equitable to giveuniversity staffs similar treatment to those in comparable employment, notablydoctors, teachers and civil servants, and draw attention to the ill-feeling created in the Universities at the decision to post-date the last salary increases, which were announced in March 1957 but did not take effect until August of that year.Back-dating to October 1959 would increase the cost of the settlement in 1960-61to  5J millions.Arguments in favour of October 19595. The Government have recently conceded much greater amounts of retrospection both in the award to the Executive Class of the Civil Service andin the decision to accept the Pilkington Commission^ recommendations on theNational Health Service. If the Government concede retrospection for adminsitrative, scientific and other Civil Service claims, they cannot reasonablyrefuse to back-date the university salaries increases as a matter of principle; itwould clearly be discriminating&apos; against university staffs if they are singled out forthis treatment among other professional workers financed mainly from theExchequer.56894THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT

6. Moreover, although the Government provide the bulk of the universities&apos;resources, they have consistently resisted suggestions in Parliament and elsewherethey they should exercise a closer control over the way in which the universitiesconduct their affairs, on the grounds that this would constitute a threat to theiracademic freedom: to this extent the universities are in a different constitutional position from the nationalised industries.(j7. Moreover, the Government are pressing the universities to expand to meetnational needs: the U:G.C. is now asking the universities to make proposalsinvolving a further increase of 35-40,000, which would make a total of some175,000 compared with the present 105,000. It is difficult for the Government topress the universities to co-operate in a major expansion, and at the same time totake action on salary claims which the universities would regard as unjust. .Arguments against October 19598. It is important to make a distinction between normal salary improvements and the re-assessment of pay scales which have recently been undertaken by, e.g.,the Pilkington Commission. While a case can be made for retrospection in thesecond category, there is not in general an argument for it in the first. In particular,the Burnham Committee&apos;s arrangements contain no provision for retrospection.If the argument were conceded to university staffs, it would weaken the ground of the Government and industry in dealing with claims by industrial workers who do not generally receive back-dated increases in pay. In the particular case ofScotland, back-dating to October 1959 would cause resentment among scottish teachers whose last salary increase dated from 1st January, 1960.Date of Implementation summary. The majority of the Wages Policy Committee were not in favour of accepting the U.G.C.&apos;s recommendation that the new salary increases shouldbe back-dated. Since the discussion in the Wages Policy Committee I have consulted Sir Keith Murray, Chairman of the U.G.C., about the reactions ofhis Committee if the Government felt unable to concede retrospection.10. Sir Keith emphasises the great importance that the universities attach to this point the bitter ill-feeling created by the post-dating of the previous pay increase in 1957; the fact that the universities, unlike doctors and teachers, havehad no interim increases in the period under discussion (the U.G.C. refrained from making such requests because they considered that changes should not be madeat frequent intervals); the inequity for university teachers of being six months ormore behind teachers in training colleges and advanced colleges of technology(October 1959), doctors (January 1960 plus generous lump sum), civil servants(October 1958). The U.G.C. proposals to provide &quot; spread&quot; for lecturers inscarce subjects, though inevitable, will arouse considerable opposition in the universities. The U.G.C.&apos;s task of persuading the universities to carry out theexpansion which the Government is seeking would be greatly impeded if it was felt in the universities that the Government was not behind them.11. In view of the division of opinion in the Wages Policy Committee, Iseek a decision by the Cabinet on whether the new scales recommended by theU.G.C. for non-medical university staffs should have effect from 1st October, 1959.D.
