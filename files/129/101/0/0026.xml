Printed for the Cabinet.   May I960C. (60) 76 Copy No.    555th May, 1960CABINETDECIMAL COINAGEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the British Association appointed a Metric Committee early in 1958 underthe Chairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver. Although the Committee were originally intended to review the case for the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures it was agreed at an early stage that their scope might usefully be extendedto cover the decimalisation of the currency and their terms of reference were extended accordingly. The Committee have had no official status but theGovernment have from the outset expressed approval of the British Association^initiative and the expert knowledge and co-operation of Government departments have been placed at the Committee&apos;s disposal.2. The Report of the Metric Committee was published by the BritishAssociation on 4th May, 1960. The first part of the Report discusses the case for introducing a decimal system of coinage. As is explained in the Report, theCommittee received written evidence from a wide range of institutions trade associations, local authorities, nationalised industries, learned and professionalsocieties, &amp;c. But they took no oral evidence and did not seek to discover the viewsof the man in the street.3. The conclusion which the Committee formed on the question of a decimalcoinage and the recommendation which they offer are annexed. They can besummarised as follows:(i) Decimalisation is primarily a domestic question.(ii) There is widespread approval for it in principle.(iii) The bodies consulted showed an overwhelming wish to retain the poundas the major unit. In this case the  /mil system (i.e., the poundsubdivided into 1,000 parts) would probably be the best decimal system.(iv) The cost to the country of converting machines, &amp;c, would be heavy(over  100 millions), but not unduly large in relation to the resourcesof the country.(v) Decimalisation of the currency should precede adoption of metric weights and measures.4. The Committee recognise that the Government will need to test publicopinion but strongly recommend that an early decision should be taken, since the longer a decision is delayed the greater will be the cost if a change is eventuallymade. While this is undoubtedly sound advice, there can be no question of taking a snap decision on so important an issue. The Government will, however, beexpected to offer some comment as soon as the Report is published. The immediate question is, therefore, what that comment should be. We ought presumably toexpress appreciation of the Report and announce that we are considering theviews expressed in it and that we shall be glad to receive any indications of publicopinion on the question of a decimal currency.5. A more difficult question, however, is whether we should express any immediate view on the possibility that if a decimal currency were introduced itmight be based (as in South Africa) on a unit not of a pound but of 10s.  The56989
Beaver Report brings out fairly clearly the technical superiority of the 10s. unitover the pound as a basis for a decimal currency. The pound does not lend itselfconveniently to decimalisation. If it were sub-divided into 100 sub-units,equivalent to about 2-Jd., these would be too large to serve as the minimum unit of currency. To sub-divide them into halves and quarters would nullify muchof the advantage of decimalisation. The alternative is to sub-divide the poundinto 1,000 parts (the  /mil system) which produces a sub-unit equivalent to less*than a farthing. This is unnecessarily small and involves the inconvenience and expense of working to three places of decimals. Most decimal currencies, such asthe dollar, use only two places of decimals.6. Despite these considerations the Beaver Committee report a general desireamong the bodies which they consulted to retain the pound as the major unit.If we give no lead on this question, public discussion can be expected to rangeover both the major questions at issue the case for and against decimalisation assuch and the rival merits of systems based on a pound or a 10s. unit. The risk isthat this will prove to be such a wide area of debate that no clear expression ofopinion will emerge at all. There might therefore be advantage in our indicatingat the outset whether we are or are not prepared to contemplate replacing the pound by a 10s. unit. If we are not, discussion will then be usefully limited tothe case for and against adopting a decimal system based on the pound.7. What lead ought we to give? As I have said, the Beaver Committee reportsa heavy preponderance of opinion in favour of retaining the pound from trade associations, public utilities, learned societies, professional institutions, &amp;c. ManyBritish Trade Commissioners overseas expressed to the Committee the view thatthe pound ought to be retained in view of its prestige and associations. The Bankof England share this view.8. My own view is that though retention of the pound might remove someof the attraction from decimalisation we should be taking an unjustifiable risk withthe status of our currency and our general financial prestige if we adopt a 10s. unit in place of the pound. I am inclined to think therefore, that we should make anannouncement (a) Saying that the Government welcome and are considering the Report.(b) Inviting public comment.(c) Bringing out clearly the issue which would be likely to arise, if a movewere made to a decimal currency, between the practical advantages ofbasing this on a 10s. unit, and the disadvantages of abandoning the pound. At the same time the statement should indicate that theGovernment would see very great difficulty in contemplating the latter course.I should be glad to know whether my collegues would agree to the issue of astatement on these lines.D.

annex extract from Report of the Metric Committee7.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONConclusionsThe main conclusions we have reached from our enquiry are as follows:Although respondents express little dissatisfaction with the present systemof coinage in industry and commerce, there is wide approval of the concept ofdecimal coinage.There is some disagreement as to the preferred method of decimalisationbut there is an overwhelming wish to retain the Pound as the major unit. Ifthis is accepted, the  /mil or  /cent, with the cent suitably subdivided,systems appear to be the most suitable. These systems are also the mostpopular.Decimalisation of the coinage would be helpful by simplifying moneycalculations, with particular advantage in the fields of business machines andin education.Decimalisation of the coinage is primarily a domestic question. The mainqualification to this statement is that any system which involved abandoning the pound as the major unit might lower the status of our currency.Decimalisation of the coinage would give only slight advantage in our international trade.So far as we have been able to ascertain, the transitional costs consequent upon decimalisation of the coinage would be heavy, but would not be undulylarge in relation to the resources of the country and the long-term benefitsthat would accrue.The question of decimal coinage may be considered On its own meritsindependently of the system of weights and measures but decimalisation ofthe coinage should precede any future plan for the adoption of the metricsystem.recommendation on all the available evidence we consider there is a strong case for the adoptionof a decimal system of coinage. Our evidence, received mainly from industry and commerce, may not, however, accurately reflect public opinion either on theprinciple or the method of decimalisation. Clearly, in such a change general approval and understanding on the part of the public would be essential and it ishoped that our report will provide a basis on which the public may be informed.The time has come for a decision to be made in principle on the question ofdecimal coinage, and this decision can only be made by the Government.We therefore recommend:That the Government should aim to take an early decision in principle for or against the adoption of a decimal coinage. The longer the delay thegreater will be the transitional cost if a change is eventually made. before taking such a decision it would doubtless be necessary to make further enquiries, including a sounding of public opinion. Prior to and during suchenquiry efforts should be made to inform the public on the issues involved.If a decision were taken to adopt decimal coinage we find that a minimum ofthree years&apos; notice would be required to make essential preparations. This periodof notice should provide ample time to familiarise the public with the new system.
