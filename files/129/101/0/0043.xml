(60) 939th June, I960CASINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1960-61 AND LATER SESSIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentThe Future Legislation Committee are now ready to submit to the Cabineta provisional programme of Bills for next Session, together with a conspectus ofthe major legislation we think should be undertaken in the two following Sessions.The Forward Plan2. We have drawn up this forward plan, the main features of which areset out in Annex A, in order to put the next Session in perspective and to securefor the greater part of the Parliament a programme which will be politicallycoherent and, from the point of view of drafting and the business of the House,reasonably manageable. In addition to a number of major-Bills on various subjects,the pattern has certain recognisable themes running right through it social ormoral reform, improvement of our financial institutions and commercial practice,a progressive attack on the problems of transport and a steady improvement, ona wide front, of the criminal and civil law and its administration. Reorganisationof the nationalised industries, not all all of which require legislation, will probablybe proceeding. And constitutional and other development in the Commonwealthand the Colonies will be a recurrent subject of legislation as and when the occasionarises. The pattern of Scottish legislation will, as appropriate, be adjusted toaccord with decisions on the English Bills.3. The picture sketched in Annex A is not, and does not aim at being,complete. But if the Cabinet felt able to give it general approval, as a solid (ifrather unexciting) legislative achievement at which to aim in our present termof office, the necessary planning and preparation could proceed.Detailed Programme for 1960-614. For the next Session we must go, without delay, into much more detail.After discussion with all Ministers concerned, the Committee have allocated thematerial put forward into the following categories:A. 1.-Essential Bills, which depend on some inescapable time-table.A.2.-Contingent Bills, the need for which depends on some factor at presentunknown.B.l.-Main programme Bills.B.2.-Other programme Bills.C-Other Bills, for which it is unlikely that time can be found.P.-Bills for handing to Private Members successful in the ballot.57147TOP SECRETBPrinted for the Cabinet.

5. The unavoidable and possibly unavoidable Bills in lists A.1 and A.2 call for little comment except that, while some of the latter may prove not to be requireduntil a later Session, there may be others not in the list which, though on present information unlikely, we may later find that we have to include.6. The &quot; programme&quot; Bills in lists B.1 and B.2 together constitute a programme much heavier than we can comfortably perhaps even possibly undertake. Some of them for example, Housing Subsidies, Rating and Valuation,and Overseas Resources Development are expressions of important political decisions which have yet to be considered by the Cabinet and which it may bedecided to defer to a later Session. But to many of them we are already committedand the Committee recommend the Cabinet to agree (a) That for all the Bills in lists B.1 and B.2 the Ministers concerned should beinvited to seek the necessary policy decisions as soon as possible.(b) That progress should be made with the drafting of all these Bills. (I shouldmention that substantial progress has already been made.)(c) That no Bills should at this stage be added to lists B.1 and B.2 except on thebasis that particular, identified Bills are relegated to a later Session tomake room for them.Then, rather nearer the time, we can consider what further reductions must be made.7. In conclusion I should like to draw the Cabinefs attention to List P, the bills which the Committee consider might be prepared for handing to private members successful in the ballot. This arrangement has the double advantage ofincreasing the amount of legislation desired by the Government without adding tothe pressure on Government time and of obstructing at least some of the unwelcomelegislation devised by Private Members for themselves.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,8th June, 1960.
