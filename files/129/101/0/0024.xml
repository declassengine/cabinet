(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)The joint declaration issued on 30th March, at the end of my recent discussions with President Eisenhower, contemplated that arrangements would be made, between the Governments of the United States, the UnitedKingdom and the Soviet Union, to institute a &quot;co-ordinated research programme&quot; for the purpose of improving methods of detecting nuclearexplosions below a seismic magnitude of 4. 75.    The President and Iwere satisfied, on the advice of British and United States experts, thata &quot;joint programme&quot; on a tripartite basis would be a slow and cumbrousmethod of procedure, and that more rapid progress was likely to be made if each of the three countries conducted separately its own part in a&quot;co-ordinated programme&quot;.    The concept is that each should notify the others in advance of the experiments which it proposes to undertake so asto ensure that the whole field is covered and that unrewarding duplicationis avoided;   and that there should thereafter be a full exchange of resultsand continuing consultation at the technical level.    It was also hoped that facilities would be given for each side to send observers to inspectexperiments conducted under this programme, particularly thoseinvolving nuclear explosions.2.      The United States authorities have already drawn up a programmeof experiment to improve methods of detecting nuclear explosions belowthe proposed threshold of 4. 75.     They are establishing throughout theUnited States a chain of detection stations, including some unmannedseismic stations, which will be completed by the autumn of this year.By October they expect to be ready to conduct nuclear and conventionalexplosions, in different underground environments, to test the efficacyof these detection stations.    In 1961 they will establish further detectionstations in the United States and possibly in Canada.    This will be their contribution to the &quot;co-ordinated programme&quot; of research.3.      V/e ourselves have already been making a modest contribution.Within the next six months we shall complete the series of experimentswhich we have been making in Cornwall to test the theory that explosionscan be muffled by concealing them in deep underground cavities.We have also been developing improved systems of instrumentation, andit is desirable that this should continue at an enhanced rate.    We havenow to consider what further contribution we can make to the&quot;co-ordinated programme&quot;.C.(60) 7427th April, I960CABINETNUCLEAR TESTSMemorandum by the Prime Minister-1-SECRET
4.      The Atomic Energy Authority consider that we could mostusefully contribute by supplementing the detection stations which areto be established in the United States.   They recommend that a numberof detection stations should be built in Canada.   This would have threeadvantages.   First, it would increase the value of the results to beobtained from the stations in the United States, for the coverage wouldbe more complete.   Secondly, it would not be necessary for us tomake further experimental explosions, of our own;   our stations wouldbe observing the explosions which the Americans have already decidedto make.   Thirdly, we should be engaging in a joint Anglo-Americanprogramme and should thereby be enabled to continue our closetechnical collaboration with the United States authorities.   We should get the benefit of advice and help from the powerful team of seismolo-gists which has already been assembled in the United States.5.      An outline of the proposed programme and its coo-to is givenin the Annex to this memorandum.6.      It may be possible to enlist some degree of Commonwealthsupport for this programme.   The stations would be erected in Canada;and the Canadian Government might be willing to make some contribution towards the local costs.   Failing that, they might contribute the logistic support and they and other Commonwealth countries might provide(and pay for) the services of some experts.   Australia, which hasalready played a notable part in the testing of nuclear weapons and tosome extent in seismology, might be willing to send some of the scientific staff required to man the detection stations.   New Zealand,which has already promised help with seismology in New zealand and has some good seismologists, might also be ready to second someof these for a period of service in the Canadian stations.The practical possibilities of securing this degree of Common-wealth co-operation in our part of the research programme might with advantage be explored in the course of the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers.7.      I would myself make it clear to President Eisenhower when i see him next month that we would not embark on any actual expenditureuntil the Soviet Government have agreed that arrangements for aco-ordinated research programme should be made.8.       After consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister for Science, I invite the Cabinet to agree in principle that weshould offer to undertake, as our contribution to the &quot;co-ordinatedprogramme of research&quot;, a programme on the broad lines indicated inthe Annex to this memorandum - at an estimated cost of about 3. 25 millions over the next three years.   If this proposal is accepted in principle, the immediate practical steps to be taken will be:-(i)   To obtain the consent of the Canadian Government for theestablishment of detection posts   in Canada and to seek from them a contribution towards the cost andco-operation in providing technical and logistic support.For this purpose, after a preliminary approach to thePrime Minister of Canada, discussions ohould be openedshortly at the technical level with the Canadians and thereafter, on a tripartite basis, between the Canadians,the Americans and ourselves.&apos; -2-SECRET
(ii)   Orders should be placed by the Atomic Energy Authority  assp&apos;.)n as poMible for the supply of seismometers and otheequipment from the United States, at an estimatedcost of half-a-million dollars.The Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand shouldbe asked if they would be willing to help to man thedetection stations by lending seismologists and othertechnical staff.(iv)   The Atomic Energy Authority should be invited to assumetechnical and financial responsibility for the conduct ofthe programme as a whole, including the enhancedinstrumentation development programme, and should seek approval for supplementary expenditure as necessary(v)   An inter-Departmental Committee of officials comprising,under Foreign Office Chairmanship, representativesof interested Whitehall Departments and of the atomic energy Authority should be appointed to advise on policy questions arising from this programme.   ( ThisCommittee would discharge functions similar to thoseof the inter-Departmental Committee which handledpolicy questions arising from trials of nuclear weapons.)(iii)H.M.10, Downing Street, S.W.T.27th April, I960-3-
SECRET171ANNEXOUTLINE OF UNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTIONTO RESEARCH PROGRAMMEIt is proposed that we should construct in Canada (i) the completeseismological section of a control post, as recommended by the geneva conference of Scientific Experts;  and (ii) about a dozen posts of a muchsimpler type.    For the main post a building of permanent constructionwould be required, but the simpler posts would each require only ahut and a recording van.   The main post would be manned by threescientists and four technicians.   Each of the simpler posts would bemanned by one scientist and two technicians.   All posts would requirelogistic support   - for living accommodation, communications, etc.The main control post would be manned continuously, but the simplerposts need be manned only intermittently, mainly for periods of twomonths at a time while the experimental explosions were being prepared and made.2.      The capital cost of buildings and contruction in Canada wouldbe about $1. 5 millions.   Equipment obtained in Canada might cost$1 million.   Instruments purchased in the United States would cost$0.5 million.The total cost of a three year research programme is estimatedat  3. 25 millions, of which less than half would be in dollars;   this estimate includes  0. 75 million for an enhanced instrumentationdevelopment programme.3.       The sit e for the main post must be carefully chosen.   Stringentconditions of &quot;seismological noise&quot; must be met, and it may take a surveteam three or four months to find a good site.    The conditions for thesimpler posts are not so stringent.We should establish as quickly as possible at least two surveyteams, each containing three technical men (one geologist, oneseismologist and one technician), together with support, to look for good sites.4.      Most of the instruments required for the main post and for thesimpler posts   can be obtained commercially in the United States.   Twofirms are already making long runs of instruments for the United StatesGovernment, and it is probable that any orders we placed could be metwithin  six months, simply by adding our orders to those already placed by the Americans.   The total dollar costs of the instruments requiredwill be of the or der of $0. 5 million.A considerable amount of instruments and equipment will beobtained in the United Kingdom.   Some of this could be exchanged withthe United Spates, in order that both sides can try the other&apos;s equipment.The United States and the United Kingdom might each make an offer tothe Soviet Union to exchange instruments with them.-4-
