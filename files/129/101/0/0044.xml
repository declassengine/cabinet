5. Parliament have not yet been told anything about the need for this additional  80 millions of short-term capital since this only recently became knownto the Government. It has not been told specifically about the intention thatthe Agency would lend the  40 millions; when the Ministry loan of  70 millions was announced in Parliament reference was made to the fact that apart from theloan the Agency would be continuing to finance capital developments outsideNewport, but no figure was given.6. The problem before the R.T.B. equity can be sold is to ensure thatthe provision of the  80 millions of new short-term capital can be satisfactorilyarranged. In formulating a scheme for the disposal of the Company, BaringBrothers have taken account of the need to provide this  80 millions of short-term capital and have put forward proposals incorporating terms which they advise the agency are as favourable to the Government as the market is likely to accept. Thedetails of this scheme are briefly as follows : (i) The existing equity capital of the Company would be sold tothe public for say       ...      ............(ii) New equity capital would be created and would be sold to thepublic along with the existing equity capital; this would raisesay        ........................(iii) Against the security of debenture stock the Agency would make to the Company a loan (referred to in the preceding paragraph) of    .....................(iv) To cover the balance of the  40 millions loan already promisedthe Agency would also subscribe for cumulative,participating, redeemable preference shares to the value of(v) In . addition the public would be invited to subscribe fordebentures to the value of    ...      .........(vi) It would be hoped that the Banks and the Acceptance houses would make available short-term finance of......In brief, therefore, item (i)  46 millions would be in payment for the Agency&apos;sexisting investment in the equity of the Company; items (iii) and (iv)- 20 millionseach together with the  70 millions loan from the Ministry of Power would beavailable to finance the longer-term capital commitments of  110 millions; anditems (ii), (v) and (vi)  17 millions,  30 millions, and  35 millions-would providethe cash for the additional peak short-term requirements of about  80 millions which are now foreseen. The Agency and Baring Brothers expect that a scheme on these lines would make it possible to offer the equity to the public in the nearfuture.7. Given the foregoing position, a sale of the equity at this time would beopen to the following objections:(i) It would mean that over the years 1960-62 the Ageney&apos;s net cash receipts from sale of the equity of R.T.B. would amount to  6 millions only(i.e., sale price  46 millions less new investment  40 millions).(ii) It would secure for the Government a share in the Company&apos;s future growth only to the extent of limited participation rights attached tothe  20 millions new preference shares; no similar provision couldbe made for the Agency&apos;s debentures of  20 millions or for the Ministryof Power&apos;s loan of  70 millions.(iii) It is very likely that the  35 millions of loans from the Banks and theAcceptance Houses, the  30 millions of debentures offered to the public and, to make them marketable later, the Ageney&apos;s  20 millions ofdebentures would have to rank as to security before the Ministry of power&apos;s loan. This would be an important amendment of the present agreement between the Ministry and the Company; it would have tobe reported to the House of Commons and might well be debated inaccordance with the assurance (reproduced in Appendix I to this paper)given by the Home Secretary during the debate on Committee Stage ofthe Iron and Steel (Financial Provisions) Bill.millions461720203035
. 8. If, therefore, the Agency were to proceed with the disposal of the.Companyon these terms the Government would be open to the criticisms that although wehad managed to sell R.T.B. the amount of cash therefrom that would actuallyaccrue to the Exchequer in the next two or three years would be only  6 millions;that we had secured only a small share in the Company&apos;s future growth; that wehad materially worsened the security for the Ministry of Power&apos;s loan; and thatin the result the Company, in which there will be invested  128 millions of privatemoney and  110 millions of Government finance, could hardly be said in any real sense to have been returned to private ownership. If, on the other hand, theCompany were not sold at this time we should disappoint-at least temporarily-some of our supporters, both in the House and outside it, for there is little doubtthat the devesting of R.T.B. has come to be regarded as the touchstone of our determination to complete the process of denationalising the steel industry.9. In these circumstances there is an alternative course of action which meritsconsideration. The Agency have contemplated that, if they were to proceed withthis sale of R.T.B. in the near future, the next step would be to sell a substantial part of their prior charge holdings in Companies already denationalised; it would hardly be possible for this to be done before the end of the year at the earliest.In order to avoid the least attractive of these securities being left on theGovernments hands the Agency are advised that it would be advantageous tosell them in one comprehensive &quot; package &quot; transaction, or perhaps two: theyhave already had preliminary&apos; discussions with Messrs. Morgan, Grenfell aboutblock sales of this kind. If, however, R.T.B. were not to be sold this summer itshould be possible for the Agency to arrange such a comprehensive sale of priorcharges in, say, the autumn. If this were done the Agency could be asked to explore the possibility of arranging for the issue by R.T.B. of say  50 millions of debenturesand for their sale to the public as part of the package deal.10. An alternative operation of this kind would have the following advantages:(i) We should meet the increasing desire on the part of our own supporters tosee the return to private hands of the Government^ large share in thecapital of companies whose equity has already been sold.(ii) As a result of this operation, very substantial sums would accrue to theExchequer, perhaps of the order of  100 millions.(iii) It would be consistent with the Government^ declared intentions, forwhatever the general expectation may be, we have always been careful(as appears from the Ministerial statements reproduced in Appendix II)not to commit ourselves to any particular timing or order of disposals.(iv) The operation of disposing of  50 millions of R.T.B. debentures would if found practicable relieve the Exchequer of the need to find 50 millions towards the Company&apos;s development plans and would bean earnest of the Government&apos;s intention to proceed with the devestingof the Company as soon as that seemed expedient. The  50 millions ofdebentures would if they were to be sold to the public almost certainly have to rank for security prior to the Ministry of Power&apos;sloan but this would be less likely to give rise to criticism if the Company&apos;sequity capital were to remain, at least for a period, in Governmenthands.(v) When R.T.B.&apos;s development projects, particularly the strip mill at Newport,are nearer to fruition the sale of the company should be easier andmight on that account yield a better price.11. On the other hand, the existing prior charges for the most part carry acoupon lower than the rates of interest now current and they include some 30 millions of irredeemable 3% per cent, preference stock. For this reason theywill have to be sold at a discount (the Agency have mentioned a sale figureof  140 millions in respect of the total existing holding i.e., excluding thenew R.T.B. debentures of  158 millions nominal). This may give rise to criticism,but it ought to be possible to meet it.12. These alternatives are finely balanced. I am, however, inclined to the view which is shared by the- Paymaster-General and the Minister of Power that thepreferable course at this stage would be to arrange for the disposal of a block of57165
the Agency&apos;s prior charges including, if possible,  50 millions of new R.T.B.debentures. If this is to be done it will be necessary for the Agency to be givenearly instructions both to discontinue their present discussions about R.T.B. (orotherwise the City will begin to regard an early sale of the Company as a certainty)and to explore with their advisers the alternative arrangements outlined above.Early decisions are in any event desirable in order that a general statement of theGovernment^ intentions may be made during the debate on the Opposition motionabout the denationalisation of R.T.B. which has been put down for 27th June. Inthe debate we must also make it clear that we shall have to find very substantial sums for R.T.B.13.   I therefore invite my colleagues to agree:(i) That we should adopt the alternative course summarised in paragraph 10above rather than proceed with the early sale of the R.T.B. equity.(ii) That the Agency should be instructed forthwith to prepare a scheme forselling a block of prior charges as early as practicable.(iii) That we should defend this course of action on the ground that, giventhe momentum of the Company&apos;s present expansion programme, itwould be wiser to defer the sale of the R.T.B. equity until a date nearer to the completion of its major development plans.14. If this course is approved, the question of how much will have to besaid by the Government spokesmen in the debate on 27th June will requireseparate consideration when the terms of the Motion are known.D.

APPENDIX IExtract from Statement by the Home Secretary During the committee stage of the Iron and Steel Bill: 22nd March, I960. (Official ReportVol. 620, No. 83, dated Wednesday, 23rd March, 1960, Columns 426-7)We have, therefore, two separate problems to consider. One the statement by my right hon. Friend that he will inform the House of any variation orre-negotiation, and secondly, something written into the Bill that there shall, eachfinancial year, be the opportunity of stating any change or any situation vetted bythe Comptroller and Auditor General which the House shall be able to consider.I think that the only addition to the statements already made by theGovernment which is necessary is that there shall be an undertaking given, which Iam ready to give on behalf of the Government, that if such a report is made in thefirst place by my right hon. Friend, or if such a report is made under Clause I (6) ofthe Bill, there shall be an opportunity given by the Government for discussion bythe House. That will mean that if there is to be any such report, we will undertakethat the House will have an opportunity of discussing it. That will mean that therewill then be an opportunity for a debate in the House.APPENDIX IIMinisterial StatementsA. Extract from Speech by the Minister of Power (Mr, Richard Wood)During the Second Reading Debate of the Iron and Steel Bill. (official report for Thursday, 18th February, 1960; Volume 617, No. 59,Columns 1448,1449, 1450)Cols. 1448-1449The question of denationalisation has been exercising the minds of some hon.Gentlemen recently. The Bill, as I have tried to explain, is in no way concernedwith questions of denationalisation, but draws attention to the large loan which theGovernment are making to a company still in public ownership, Richard thomas and Baldwin&apos;s. The House may wish to know how the intention to make this loanaffects the progress of devesting the remaining assets which are held by the Iron andSteel Holding and Realisation Agency. Therefore, it would be timely to state theGovernments policy on this.We took powers under the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, to return the industry to private ownership according to what we then considered,, and still consider, to bethe best interests of the national economy. Since 1953, we have pressed forward as quickly as possible and having regard to all the circumstances with the implementation of that policy, and much has been accomplished. I cannot denythat the process has been made more difficult by the uncertainty which has beenoverhanging the future of the industry because of the declared intention of the partyopposite to renationalise it if they were returned to power last October.Cols. 1449-1450I was about to say that the remaining holdings in the agency fall into four parts.First, come the fixed interest securities; secondly, comes Richard Thomas andBaldwin&apos;s, which is the largest firm still in public ownership; next come the10 smaller companies; and, lastly, there is the outstanding loan by the Agency tothe Steel Company of Wales. The Agency, therefore, is proceeding as rapidly as itprudently and properly can towards the completion of its statutory functions.I do not believe that it is either desirable or right to&quot; specify a detailedprogramme or timetable, but I am quite certain that the programme of disposalsmust take account first, of the state of the market, secondly, of the demand for thedifferent kind of security and share capital that these holdings represent, thirdly, of
the nature of the undertakings, and, fourthly, of the requirements of the Iron andSteel Act, 1953, that the Agency, without disregarding other relevant matters should secure, in the words of Section 18,&quot; that the consideration obtained from the disposal of assets is financiallyadequate. . . .&apos;*All that I feel it necessary or desirable at present to say is that the programmeof disposal will continue, but that the manner in which the programme is carriedout, and the timetable to which it will conform, must be matters of judgment onwhich it is not possible to lay down rules in advance.I have announced that the Agency intends to dispose of its present holdings,which will certainly include an intention to dispose of the remaining holdings inRichard Thomas and Baldwin&apos;s.B. Extract from Speech by the Economic Secretary, Treasury, During theCommittee Stage of the Iron and Steel Bill. (Official Report for Tuesday,22nd March, 1960, Volume 620, No. 82, Columns 365 and 366)The Government are determined to proceed with the process ofdenationalisation until it is completed, and it is in no sense a weakening of thatdetermination to point out that the rate of progress which the Agency can make inreturning the industry to private enterprise must inevitably depend upon the stateof the market and the fulfilment of the considerations to which, by Statute, the agency must have regard.I hope that I have left the Committee in no doubt about our determination topress on with the completion of denationalisation. The hope of the Governmentis that, within the lifetime of the present Parliament, the Agency will complete itsduty of substantially returning the industry to private enterprise. We are veryhopeful that conditions will be such that the Agency will be able to make significantprogress during the course of this year.C. Extract from the Chancellor^ Budget Statement.  (Official Report forMonday, 4th April, 1960; Volume 621, No. 91, Column 48).. . For I should mention that in these calculations I have not taken account ofany receipts which may come to the Exchequer from the Iron and Steel RealisationAccount, I fully expect however that the Agency will be able to make significantprogress during the year with sales of securities and that the Iron and SteelRealisation Account will yield some very substantial relief to the below-the-lineburden on the Exchequer.(Hon. Members: &quot; Hear, Hear.&quot;) I cannot tell what that sum will be.
