SECRET . r. n153(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0^(601 67 COPY NO. ^c5l12th April, I960CABINETGENEVA CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEAMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the Minister of Agriculture, who is leading the United kingdom delegation to the Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva, hasadvised that there is evidence of a Mexican-Saudi Arabian intention totable a straight nine-mile territorial sea proposal at the very end of theConference if no other proposal obtains a two-thirds majority.    He has asked that the implications of this proposal should be examined as amatter of urgency.     The issue is whether in the absence of any otheragreement a nine-mile territorial sea and fishery limit would be preferable to the Conference reaching no agreement at all.Consequences of a Breakdown2.      The Minister of Agriculture feels that a breakdown of theConference would quickly lead to a very bad situation.    He says thatthere is a definite tendency among many delegations towards twelve miles.This tendency is widespread on the fishery side, and two or three stronggroups support it on the territorial sea side.    If no agreement emergesfrom the Conference it is quite possible in his view that within the next decade two-thirds or three-quarters of the countries of the world willby unilateral action be effectively asserting either a twelve-mile territory sea or a twelve-mile fishery limit or both;  and on the fishery side claims going well beyond twelve miles might well be made.A Nine-Mile Territorial Sea and Fishery Limit3.      The Committee on the Law of the Sea have not in the time available been able to meet to discuss the matter, but I understand thatthe following represents the views of my colleagues on the Committee,insofar as their Departmental responsibilities are concerned, asregards the merits of a straight nine-mile territorial sea and fisherylimit over a breakdown of the Conference.(i)     Fishery Considerations .    A breakdown of the Conference wouldbe the worst result.     Experience over the last ten years demonstratesconclusively that, until a firm rule of law has been clearly established,those States desiring wider territorial waters and fishery limits will inevitably take the law into their own hands.    Already many states have adopted a twelve-mile limit or more, and the more States that doso, the more acceptable will wider fishery limits become to theInternational Court of Justice.    Indeed, unless the Geneva Conference
produces a settlement, it is almost certainly only a question of time beforeall the nations off whose shores we fish have a twelve-mile limit and more.Certainly, Iceland could not be restrained from laying claims to the wholeof the Continental Shelf.    This, together with wide extensions off norway and the Faroes, would completely cripple the distant and middle-waterfishing industries as they now exist.A nine-mile limit would avoid most of this loss and, indeed, would save much of the loss which would be sustained from the adoption of atwelve-mile fishery limit.    About ten per cent of our distant-water catchis taken between nine and twelve miles, and the middle-water catch in thiszone off the Faroes is also appreciable.    A nine-mile limit is therefore muchto be preferred to a breakdown of the Conference.(ii)    Strategic Considerations.    The strategic implications of a twelve-mile territorial sea have already been examined by the Chiefs of Staff.They are strongly opposed to this limit for the following reasons:-(a) It would greatly reduce, if not remove altogether, the areasof sheltered water in which naval forces could replenishat sea in rough weather.(b) The difficulties of fixing a ship&apos;s position accurately wouldbecome much greater, thus increasing the risk of inter-national incident.(c) An extension to twelve miles might, if there was any doubt about the goodwill of the coastal States, lead to greaterinterference with coastwise passage.    It would alsotransform many of the most important internationalstraits into national waterways.     No matter what safe-guards might be written into a treaty with regard torights of innocent passage in national waters, such rights would in practice be at the mercy of the coastal State.(d) Operations against enemy submarines would be greatlyhandicapped because of the extra shelter they wouldenjoy.The only differences between the effects of a twelve-mile limit and a nine-mile limit are:-(e) That one strait (the straits of Hormuz leading into thePersian Gulf), which would be closed at twelve miles,would remain open at nine.(f) An additional three miles of open sea would be freed.As regards (e), it is unlikely that entrance would be denied in presentcircumstances whether the limit was nine or twelve miles.    As regards(f), the outermost three miles is of much less value to naval States than theother nine.     These advantages are so marginal as to render the nine-mile limit scarcely more acceptable strategically than the twelve-mile limit.
SECRETA nine-mile limit as a possible last-ditch position would therefore be highly-undesirable militarily.    Nevertheless, if the choice lay between acceptanceof a nine-mile limit and a break-down of the Conference in circumstances in which there was the prospect of numerous unilateral claims to a twelve-mile limit, militarily the balance of advantage would probably lie in accepting a nine-mile limit, provided that the right of innocent passage through international straits was guaranteed.(iii)  Shipping.     Broadly speaking the wider the territorial sea the more damaging the effects on merchant shipping interests, but the legaluncertainty which would arise from a breakdown of the Conference, withthe prospect of increasing unilateral extension of the territorial sea to twelve miles, might well be more damaging to shipping interests than theacceptance by the Conference of a nine-mile limit.(iv)   Civil Aircraft.    Since civil air transit rights are governed by theChicago Convention and the International Air Services Transit Agreement,the issue of a nine-mile territorial sea versus the breakdown of theConference is of no significance for civil aircraft.(v)   Colonial Territories.        From the point of view of the colonial territories, a nine-mile territorial sea would seem preferable to a break-down of the Conference.4.      The Cabinet will wish to consider in the light of the views recordedabove what instructions should be sent to the Minister of Agricultureregarding the possible proposal for a nine-mile territorial sea andfishery limit.K.Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department,S.W.1.12th April, I960.-3-
