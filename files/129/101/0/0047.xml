C.(60) 9720th June, I960CABINETSKYBOLTNote by the Minister of DefenceDuring my recent visit to Washington, I concluded a memorandumof understanding with Mr. Gates, the United States Secretary of Defence,about the development of SKYBOLT.   A copy is attached at Annex   A.The next step is for H. M. Ambassador, with help from the Ministry of aviation, to conclude the technical and financial agreement referred toin the last sentence of the memorandum.2.     Heads of agreement have been drafted;  their essence is containedin the draft covering agreement at Annex B, which will be supplemented by a more detailed technical agreement.   It is proposed that we should bear only such extra development costs as are incurred in meeting our needs.   In due course, when the time comes to place a production order,we shall pay the cost of production without contributing to the underlyingdevelopment costs.   This, I understand, corresponds to normal UnitedStates practice when supplying friendly Governments.3.      We have not so far had to state the number which we shall require;I have only said that we shall need a hundred or more.   In fact I foreseeour requirement as being 144 plus a percentage for spares and prooffirings.   I attach at Annex C a rough estimate of costs, but it isimpossible yet to say what the cost of the finished article will be - hence the two brackets of cost which I have given for purposes of illustration.4.     I ask my colleagues to approve the memorandum of understanding which I have signed, and to agree that H. M. Ambassador should be instructed to negotiate the technical and financial agreement.H.
