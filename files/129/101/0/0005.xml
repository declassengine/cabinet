confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC -MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March I960C. (60) 55 Copy No.   5318th March, 1960CABINETSIZE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS&apos; LISTS OF PATIENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of HealthIf the Report of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos;Remuneration is accepted in principle we shall have to enter into discussions withthe medical profession about the detailed distribution of the extra money forgeneral medical practitioners.2. In these discussions our aim will be to secure that the extra money is distributed in such a way that it helps in raising the standard of service given bythe doctors to their patients. There are a number of possible ways of doing this;but as the medical profession themselves will have views on them, it is not possibleto say, in advance of our discussions, which will, in fact, be adopted.3. One of several possible measures to raise the standard of service to patients and one which would have a high priority is a reduction in the maximum numberof patients a doctor may have. At present a single-handed practitioner without an assistant is allowed to have a list of up to 3,500 patients, and while the averagelist is much smaller quite a number have lists of, or approaching this size. Everydiscernible trend in modern-medicine indicates, however, that an increasing amountof time is required for the patient&apos;s adequate care, and it is, therefore, widely feltthat the present maximum is too high.4. The discussions about distribution offer an ideal opportunity to reduce itas, with the help of the additional money recommended by the Royal Commission,this can be done without the large list doctors suffering any loss of income. we feel, however, that it is necessary to consult the Cabinet before proposing a reductionof the maximum list because it will have financial implications which extend beyondthe Royal Commission settlement. The reason for this is that the release of patientsfrom large lists will make it easier for new doctors to enter the general medical service; and for each extra doctor the Exchequer will have to pay an additional sum into their pool of remuneration.5. Additional doctors have been entering general medical practice eachyear and this is likely to continue. The rate at which they do so will depend ona variety of factors, including the supply of practitioners and the openings availableto them elsewhere. It will be influenced also by the manner and speed with whichit may be decided, in our discussions with the profession, to effect a reduction inthe large lists: thus a reduction on a voluntary basis or one spread over a period will be less likely to swell the number of doctors than a compulsory reduction or one coming into effect at a stated date.6. The cost to the Exchequer specifically due to a reduction in the maximumlist is thus very difficult to estimate, but we consider that it would be reasonable to assume that a reduction of 250 from 3,500 to 3,250 might lead to an increase(over and above the increase that would otherwise take place) of, in all, 200 to 300general practitioners, at a cost to the Exchequer building up over a period- toperhaps  1 million a year. This cost Would, of course, be on top of the cost of implementing the Royal Commission^ Report.56748
7. Despite this extra cost we think there are strong reasons for reducingthe maximum now. The medical case is such that the measure must rank highlyamong those that would help to achieve an improvement in the Health Service.In this context the sum involved is relatively small. The fact that a reduction wasbeing made would also help to demonstrate that the settlement was in the publicinterest, as well as in the interest of the medical profession. Furthermore, it isonly, when there is extra money to distribute that a reduction can be achieved without large list doctors suffering a loss of income.8. If at some time in the future the Government wished to secure it in orderto raise the standard of medical care, there would no doubt be pressure for theExchequer to provide extra money over and above the cost of the additionaldoctors to prevent the existing large list practitioners from suffering a loss of income, even though the provision of extra money in this way would be contraryto the general intention of the Royal Commission^ Report. For this reason areduction would be much more difficult to achieve at any other time.9. Accordingly we seek the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to a reduction in themaximum list being included as one of the matters to be raised with the medical profession when the detailed distribution of the additional money arising fromthe Royal Commission^ Report is being settled.J.
