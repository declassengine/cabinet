C. (60) 84 COPY NO.   dO21st May, I960CABINETTALKS WITH EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONSMemorandum by the Minister of labour in our Election manifesto &quot;The Next Five Years&quot; under the heading&quot;Sharing Prosperity&quot; we stated: -&quot;Unity.     Prosperity depends on the combined efforts of thenation as a whole.    None of us can afford outmoded approaches to the problems of to-day, and we intend to invite therepresentatives of employers and trade   unions to considerafresh with us the human and industrial problems that the next five years will bring.&quot;2.     I think that it would now be opportune for the Government to invitethe employers and trade unions to discuss these problems with us.    Weare far enough away from the General Election for talks to be held in anon-partisan atmosphere.    We shall be vulnerable politically unlesstalks have started well before the Party Conference in October.Nature of the talks3.     I suggest that the talks should be opened by a meeting under theChairmanship of the Prime Minister accompanied by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, President of the Board of Trade and myself.    -TheBritish Employers1 Confederation, the Federation of BritishIndustries and Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the.National Union of Manufacturers should be asked to nominaterepresentatives on the employers&apos; side and the Trades Union congress would, of course, be invited to nominate the trade union representatives.We should also invite the Chairmen of the National Coal Board, gas council, Electricity Council and British Transport Commission.    Thismeeting would later be followed by further meetings under theChairmanship of the Chancellor or myself.4.      The talk under the Prime Minister&apos;s Chairmanship should be on abroad basis as a review of the human and industrial problems for thenext five years.    This would be   in contrast with previous talks betweenthe Government of the day and representatives of employers and tradeunions taken by the Prime Minister, which have in recent years been called in order to deal with a particular crisis.    I think we stand a better chance of the talks being successful if we put the problems into a widesetting.    It is advisable that on this occasion the Government should notemphasise the need for wage or price restraint or make any request for them.
Subjects for discussion5.      I suggest that the talks should be concerned with three mainsubjects:-(a) Full Employment.    We should make clear that the maintenanceof full employment is a prime object of our economic policy and explain the financial and trade difficulties to be overcome both in our domesticeconomy and in relation to the balance of payments to give practical effect to this policy.(b) Industrial Relations.    There is a need for a fresh look at therelations between management and labour and at the efficiency of thearrangements for considering and dealing with the problems that arise from time to time.(c) Productivity.     We should stress the need for a steady expansion ofour economy based on stable prices and increasing productivity as essential to maintain full employment, establish the social conditions we want at home and give us the economic strength to carry out our inter-national policy.    This theme should be related to the two earlier subjectsfull employment and satisfactory relations between management andlabour are the essential basis of production.Some points which might be developed by the Chancellor and myself are treated more fully in the Annex to this paper.Action arising from the talks6.      The problems are not new.    We cannot expect nor do we seek anydramatic developments.    Many of the points are within the terms ofreference of existing Governmental-industrial bodies such as theNational Joint Advisory Council or the National Production AdvisoryCouncil for Industry and could appropriately be referred to such bodies.It is essential, however, that the meeting should do more than generallyair views and end by leaving further consideration of the subjects discussed to existing Committees..7.      The object of the meeting should, in my view, be to obtain agree-ment that on some subjects a new initiative is necessary and that reference to the existing consultative bodies is not enough.    On the subjects with which I am concerned I should like to lead the meeting toagree to forming a small Committee which could consider a report of the talks, a more detailed account of the present position on some of the subjects and suggestions for further action where this seemed necessary.This would have several advantages.    It would be a convenient way forme to put before the employers and trade unions a comprehensiveaccount of what is happening on the range of topics of interest to management, labour and myself which are related but which are atpresent being dealt with through separate Committees and Councils, andthis might throw up ideas.    It would enable me to get discussion on anumber of points listed in the Annex which are not at present accepted as falling within the scope of established employer/trade unionnegotiation machinery in industry and are not effectively discussed on
my National Joint Advisory Council. Looking to the future it mightemerge that the parties would welcome an occasional resumption ofthis kind of intimate discussion.8.     If the Committee were to consider only subjects with which I amconcerned I would propose that it should consist of three or four members from the British Employers1 Confederation and the same number fromthe Trades Union Congress.    If, however, subjects in which other ministers are interested are put to it we should have to consider bring -ing in representatives of the Federation of British Industries andpossibly other organisations representing business interests.    on balance I think the advantage lies with restricting the terms of reference of the Committee to labour subjects and for other Ministers to follow up their interests, if they wish to do so, in other ways.    I should, however,welcome the views of my colleagues.E. H.Ministry of Labour, S.W.1.20th May, I960.ANNEXOutline of Subjects for Discussion1.    EmploymentWe should explain the particular importance of full employmentin future years because of the increase in the number of young personsentering employment from the summer of I960 onwards - the &quot;bulge&quot;.If full employment is maintained the problems of the &quot;bulge&quot; will belocalised - largely in the development districts.    We should takecredit for our measures to deal with local unemployment through theLocal Employment Act, but point out the need for these to be supplemented by reasonable geographical mobility of labour and privateinitiative in the development districts by local industrialists.Reference could be made also to changes in the existing level ofemployment in particular industries, e.g., coalmining, shipbuilding,cotton  and agriculture and the need underlined for industries to lookahead and for labour to be mobile between industries and trades aswell as geographically.    This could be. related to the need for trainingin industry both for adults to increase this industrial mobility and for young persons to deal with the problems of the &quot;bulge&quot;.-3-
2.   ProductivityOn the positive side we should stress the need for a stable and expanding economy as the basis for providing full employment, thesocial conditions we want at home and a successful international policy.On this last, particular attention should be given to the need forhelping the under-developed countries and the commitments we have entered into - a subject which appeals to the trade unions.     We should explain the difficulties of maintaining full employment while avoidinginflation at home and maintaining a balance of payments, which isessential to our national livelihood and to the discharge of our overseac ommitment s.3.   Industrial relations we should avoid any appeal to common interests between management and labour and &quot;pulling together&quot;,   and recognise that thereare also irremoveable conflicts of interest.    Because of the latter weshould emphasise the need for the arrangements to consider matters affecting employers and workers (and Government) at a national,industrial and local level to be fully effective, and that to ensure this a continuing critical examination of the efficiency of the organisation ofeach side as well as of the joint machinery is essential.    In thisconnection we could welcome the inquiry by the Trades Union Congressinto strikes and question whether employers&apos; associations are convincedthat all on their side is satisfactory and that management is makingthe maximum contribution to good relations.    We would add that theGovernment would be glad to consider any steps by which they couldassist industry in any of these ways.This could lead on to a reference to subjects of importance to management and labour relations which by and large are not dealt withby existing industrial machinery, e. g. , recruitment, staff training,redundancy and retirement arrangements, and joint consultation.Practices of management on these matters range from the excellentto the out-dated.     The Party&apos;s Industrial Charter dealt with these andother matters and the Government -have taken some action in past years to encourage the spread of good practices by general propaganda at the top and by approaches to individual managements.    We could ask thequestion whether more effective steps could now be taken to raise thegeneral level in industry and whether the existing industrial organisa-tions can help to do this.May, I960
