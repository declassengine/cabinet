Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1960C. (60) 99 Copy No.        6123rd June, 1960CABINETEUROPEAN AGREEMENT ON THE PROTECTION of television BROADCASTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsMinisters&apos; Deputies of the Council of Europe at their 88th meeting which began in Strasbourg on Monday, 20th June, 1960, have before them a draftEuropean Agreement for the Protection of Television Broadcasts which is now open for signature. The text is annexed below. This regional agreement sets out toprotect television broadcasts against unauthorised rebroadcasting in other countries.This problem has been, and is still being, considered by a committee of theInternational Labour Organisation, the International United Bureau for theProtection of Industrial, Literary and Artistic Property (Berne Union) and the united nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, who are considering thepreparation of a universal convention on &quot;neighbouring rights&quot;; but this draftconvention will not be ready for some considerable time yet. In the meantime theCouncil of Europe have prepared a regional agreement which will lapse when the&quot; neighbouring rights &quot; convention is approved. This European Agreement wouldgive to the various European television companies the same protection in thiscountry as is enjoyed by the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) and theIndependent Television Authority (I.T.A.). It grants reciprocal protection to B.B.C.and I.T.A. television broadcasts in European countries. It seems generallydesirable that we should obtain this protection by signing and ratifying theAgreement.2. The draft was unanimously accepted by the Committee of Legal experts of the Council of Europe at its meeting on 29th and 30th April, 1960. In its final form it incorporates a large number of United Kingdom amendments designed toimprove its meaning and to restrict its application in certain circumstances, and officials in the Board of Trade, Post Office and Ministry of Labour now considerit suitable for application in the United Kingdom. The B.B.C. and I.T.A. havebeen consulted, and agree.&apos;3. A further reason for accepting the Agreement is the desirability of showingour solidarity with the other European countries whenever it is possible to do so.4. An Order in Council under Section 32.1(e) of the Copyright Act, 1956,will be needed to bring the Agreement into force in the United Kingdom. I am advised that an affirmative resolution of Parliament will not be necessary, and i hope that ratification would automatically follow.5. Before instructing the Permanent United Kingdom Representative to theCouncil of Europe to sign the Agreement on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentI should like to know that my colleagues are in agreement with this step.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,22nd June, 1960.
