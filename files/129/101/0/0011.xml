REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DEVELOPMENT POLICYIntroductionWe were set up in September 1959 with the following terms of reference:To examine the problems involved in assistance to the less developedareas overseas, and to make recommendations on (i) how best the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contributions to such assistance might be co-ordinated, and(ii) how best these contributions might be co-ordinated with similar assistanceoffered by other countries and institutions of the West.2. In Sections I to III of this Report we describe the background against which these questions have to be considered, under three heads The Need for development Capital; the Scale of the Problem; the United States and Europe.In Section IV, on the United Kingdom Contribution, we have summarised what assistance this country is so far providing, and discuss the limitations on the size of this assistance. Section V of the Report then deals with the question ofco-ordination of the various forms of assistance provided by the United Kingdom,and Section VI deals with co-ordination with other countries and institutions ofthe West. Finally, Section VII summarises the foregoing appreciation of theproblem and the Committee&apos;s recommendations on these questions of co-ordination.I.-THE NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL3. The need of the less developed countries for economic assistance is boundto be one of the dominant themes in any survey of the international scene to-day.In the nature of things, it is one of the most important factors in relations between those countries on the one hand and the more advanced countries on the other.In addition, it raises issues affecting the relations of the industrialised countriesamong themselves.4. The problem is not a very recent one, but in the past few years it hasentered a new phase, as the need of the less developed countries for foreign capitalhas emerged on an increased scale and in a more pressing fashion. It is not simply that there is a more widespread urge in those areas of the world to take action designed to relieve their poverty and backwardness, and in many cases theiracute population pressure; but also many of them have moved far enough forward in their planning and initial development to be able now effectively to use capitalon a larger scale, if it can be mobilised. Thus, the Indian Second Five-year Planpaves the way for a bigger Third Five-year Plan. In some countries there areparticular major projects, such as the Aswan High Dam in Egypt, or the VoltaRiver scheme in Ghana, v/hich have been the subject of technical study andfinancial negotiation for years on end, and which can each absorb great sums ofcapital. In many of these cases the drive for development has been intensifiedby the achievement of independence or the emergence of nationalist regimes.5. This marked quickening of the tempo of development, at any rate in itsown sphere of operations, was noted in the Annual Report of the international bank covering the 12 months up to 30th June, 1958, when the amount of new loansapproved by the Bank in that period had risen steeply to $711 millions, over 75 percent, more than the average of the previous three years. The Report noted thatthis had been a period of industrial recession in the United States and elsewhere,and of depressed commodity prices, but continued as follows:&quot; It would be a mistake, however, to relate the large increase in the Bank&apos;slending over the year to this immediate background. The main explanationlay in longer-term factors which are operating to make a larger number ofdevelopment projects ready and eligible for financing. One of these factorsis the long period of planning and negotiation on development programswhich have been carried out by borrowing countries and by the Bank. . . Thenumber of large projects now under consideration in the Bank indicates thatthe rise in lending during the year may have signalled the start of a new and higher rate of operations.&quot;Time has confirmed the soundness of this appreciation.
6. The larger part of the capital needed by most of the less developed countries comes from their own resources. In the case of India, for instance, theproportion supplied from the country&apos;s internal savings is roughly three-quarters.But additional resources, and in particular foreign exchange resources, from outsideare an essential supplement. Private capital makes an important contribution(though unevenly distributed) accompanied in many cases by invaluable technical and managerial skills, and it is desirable that both the capital-exporting and thecapital-importing countries should follow policies designed to encourage or atleast not to inhibit the flow of private capital. The less developed countries oughtalso to refrain from practices such as shipping discrimination which are liable toreduce the goodwill of the donor countries. Moreover, the level of demand whichthe industrialised countries maintain for the commodities produced by the less developed countries, and the outlets allowed for their manufactured products, havedecisive effects on the foreign exchange available to them from their currentearnings. In the long run it will be of cardinal importance that they should notbe prevented by tariffs and import restrictions from selling their goods in the.richercountries, if ever they are to earn enough to service the large amounts of externaldebt which they are now incurring, and to dispense with continued governmentalaid. But it would be unrealistic to imagine that devices to stimulate private investment overseas, or the international trade and commodity policies which maybe adopted, will remove or even significantly reduce the need for large-scaleeconomic assistance from the Governments of the advanced countries for someyears to come.II.-THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM7. Apart from the Soviet Union, only two main areas of the world have achieved an advanced stage of development. Europe, or most of it, forms oneof these areas. The United States and Canada form the other. To these can beadded Japan, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.8. All the rest of the world, again excluding the Soviet Union, must be classedas less developed the whole of Asia; the whole of the continent of Africa, except the Union of South Africa; the whole of Latin America.9. This is the geographical basis of definition adopted by the United Nations.These countries comprise roughly two-thirds of the world&apos;s present populationof 3,000 millions-figures which will not continue to apply for long because of the rapid rate of population increase. The two largest of these countries are also very nearly the poorest, China with a population of 650 millions and an income per head of about  15 a year, and India 400 millions and  23 per head. In theCommonwealth alone, apart from India, there are another 70 millions with less than 30 a head, and a further 14 millions with less than  70 a head.10. At that sort of income level the expectation of life is short andmalnutrition prevails. Crop failure or other disasters can rapidly result in outrightfamine for many millions of people. (Ironically, the one major programme inoperation for redistributing the world&apos;s food supplies, that is disposals ofagricultural surpluses by the United States under their Public Law 480, has arousedopposition from other countries producing these foodstuffs for export.) The firstresult of medical advance and the conquest of disease is a fall in the death rate,leading to an acceleration of the rate of population increase, which over wide areas has swallowed up much or all of the gains so far achieved from economic development. It is frequently asserted that the gap between the richer and the poorer countries is widening all the time.11. The poor countries can escape from this situation only by achieving much higher rates of investment and of increase in the stock of capital per head. but such rates of investment, if they had to be financed wholly or almost wholly fromdomestic savings, could be extracted from a very poor country only by a rigoroustotalitarian regime hence the need for financial help from outside. But foreignfinance will not solve everything. It is also necessary for receiving governments to pursue policies which will make effective use both of the aid received and oftheir own domestic resources. Such policies for example, agricultural and landreform; encouragement of birth control; the elimination of inefficiency and
corruption; the overhaul of uneconomic enterprises are often unpopular and difficult to apply. Many people are therefore ready to believe that in any caseonly a totalitarian regime can be efficient and dynamic enough to bring aboutrapid development in a really backward country, and the relative pace ofdevelopment in India and China over the next 10 years will be widely taken as avindication of whichever of these two forms of society succeeds best in the economic sphere.12. In the most recent years for which United Nations statistics areavailable it appears that up to $5 billions, a year has been going from the advancedcountries to the non-Communist less developed countries, in the form both ofprivate capital and of Government loans and grants for development and othereconomic purposes. It is estimated that, in the four years 1955-58, the outflow ofprivate long-term capital to these countries averaged $2 billions a year. As regardsGovernment funds, including those channelled through multilateral institutions, a united Nations report for the year 1957-58 stated that the total of thesecontributions to the less developed areas advanced to a record level of $3 - 3 billionsor 14 per cent, above the level recorded in the previous survey. These figures include economic assistance from Russia to non-Communist countries, but not thelarge amounts which she is believed to have provided to China, North Korea andOuter Mongolia.13. It is extremely difficult to make any realistic estimate of the amounts ofadditional capital required. Mr. Paul Hoffman, the Managing Director of theUnited Nations Special Fund, which was brought into existence in 1959 to carryout major surveys and other preparatory work for economic development, hasspoken of the need for an additional $35 billions over ten years from the &quot; have &quot;countries, on top of their present effort, to enable the economic breakthrough tobe made in the countries with which the Special Fund is concerned (and fromwhich China is excluded). Various other figures have achieved internationalcurrency, but it is. doubtful whether there is much practical value in such far-rangingestimates, which must necessarily be highly speculative.14. A more realistic approach is to start from the relatively firm anddocumented demands with which the West is already confronted, includingrequirements for particular projects or countries which have been the subject ofspecial study. Thus, it can fairly reliably be estimated that India will by 1961have spent some  5,250 millions on her Second Five-year Plan; that herconsequential total foreign exchange deficit over this period will be over  1,400millions; and that this will have been met by aid to the extent of roughly  1,000millions, and the remainder by running down of her sterling balances to theminimum safe level. India&apos;s planners appear to be thinking in terms of expenditure,in the public and private sectors together, of  7,500 millions on the Third Five-year plan, to commence in 1961. One estimate is that the consequential foreign exchangedeficit over the five years would be  1,875 millions (including  375 millions for service of existing debt); all of which would have to be financed by aid. Theprospects of mobilising aid on this scale, or even on a scale adequate to make possible a somewhat curtailed and more flexible plan, are not good, unless a radical change of attitude can be brought about on the part of the potential donorcountries. And yet, even if not curtailed, a plan of the size mentioned would, itis estimated, provide only about 12 million new jobs falling far short of theprobable net increase in the size of the working population during the Third Planperiod, conservatively estimated at 14 millions. Information about PakistaniOutline Plan for the same period has become available more recently and it islikely that it will be found necessary to provide substantial aid for this also, thoughon a smaller scale than for the Indian Plan, especially if the West mounts a concerted effort of assistance to India. Similarly, there can be no doubt that awhole series of other development programmes or projects, about which at present we have a greater or lesser amount of information, will force themselves upon theattention of the West over the next few years, and may compete for similar treatment.15. Thus, even without recourse to any global estimates, the clear facts are that aid is already at a level at which the Governments of the industrialised countries must take it into account as a substantial factor in their budgetary andeconomic policies; but that even so it falls short of the immediate and frimly established demands which the less developed countries are pressing, let alone the
amounts needed in the longer run to make a major impact on the conditions of life of the less developed world as a whole. This situation raises three questionswhich have to be considered along with those specifically posed in our terms ofreference. What can be done to deal with the budgetary and balance of paymentsobstacles which at present inhibit a bigger contribution from the advanced countriescollectively? What can be done to ensure that whatever total can be madeavailable is distributed between recipient countries in such a way as to produce the maximum return, in terms of the wide foreign policy objectives of the West?What can be done to ensure that the Governments of recipient countries pursue the policies which are needed if effective use is to be made of aid?16. On one point the position is clear from the outset. The advancedcountries will not be in a position to bring about an early and major increase inthe flow of aid, without putting a serious strain on their economies, unless eitherthey can effect some switch of resources, say, from defence to development, or their peoples are prepared to forgo some part of the increase in their ownconsumption which they expect to enjoy. It is doubtful whether this implicationof the problem of world development is widely enough appreciated, and it isimportant that it should continually be brought home to the peoples of theindustrialised countries.III. THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE17. The situation has recently entered a new phase in another importantrespect, that is, the changed relative positions of the United States and western europe. Since the war the United States has provided aid on a massive scale aid under the Marshall Plan and other arrangements for the rehabilitation ofEurope, which has now done its work, and aid for the less developed countries,still continuing. This has been accompanied by some fall in her gold holdings and a substantial increase in her liabilities overseas. In every year except one since1953 there has been an outflow of gold and dollars from the United States, inspite of the fact that she has had a current balance of payments surplus, usuallya substantial one, in these years. The total outflow since 1953 is of the order of$14 billions. In 1958 it amounted to $3^ billions in a single year, and in 1959 itis likely to be $4 billions. Although the reserve position of the United States isstill very strong compared with the United Kingdom&apos;s, this is a rate of outflowwhich clearly cannot continue indefinitely, and the United States is in the processof attempting to adjust it. She has introduced a substantial degree of tying to united States exports of aid through the Development Loan Fund, which nowaccounts for an important and increasing part of total United States economic aid.She has also given clear notice to the other industrialised countries that she expectsthem now to take a bigger share of the burden of aid. Although the United states under-Secretary of State, Mr. Dillon, has given us to understand that the UnitedStates does not mean to effect an absolute reduction in her contribution, there maybe strong Congressional pressure for such a reduction in aid appropriations inthe period immediately ahead; and, as a result of the tying of the DevelopmentLoan Fund, some countries may not take up potential allocations from this sourceor, if they do, may get less value for the money, because of the high level of prices for certain types of United States goods.18. Continental Western Europe is undeniably in a position to do more.Taking the two most important countries concerned, France is already puttinglarge amounts into the territories in Africa where her main overseas interests lie,and appears to be doing at least as much overall as any other country in relationto her resources; nor can she be accused of failing to discharge her obligationswith regard to the International Bank and the proposed International development association, but her share in these is on the low side and she has shown nodisposition to take on a bigger share or to put money out by other means in newdirections. Thus Germany is left as the individual country most obviously in aposition to increase her contribution towards meeting the general problem andto set an example for the smaller countries of Continental Europe the Beneluxand Scandinavian countries and Switzerland, which between them should be capable of making a contribution roughly comparable with that of either france or Germany.
19. In the event of a cut in United States aid, then if Europe correspondinglyincreases hers and there is so far ho assurance that this is going to happen theresult would be merely to avoid a reduction in the total amount of aid. What isrequired, from the point of view of the less developed world, is a bigger total effort.There is some force in the United States View that a necessary condition for thiswould be a bigger European share in the total effort. The fact remains that theUnited States accounts for a very large proportion of the total wealth and production of the free world. Over a longer period, and when the United Statesgold inflow has been stemmed, she should be expected to increase her owncontribution.IV.-THE UNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTIONCharacter of the United Kingdom Contribution20. The reasons why the United Kingdom is prepared to play a prominentpart in Western aid include all the general considerations so far set out in thisreport. But, because of our exceptional dependence on international trade, wehave probably been influenced more than some other countries by the motive of helping poorer countries to maintain their demand for our exports. We are also,of course, a country with an imperial history; we still have sizeable colonial territories and are the political and financial centre for the Commonwealth as awhole. These two factors have largely determined the directions in which our aidgoes. Thus, our bilateral governmental assistance has been predominately to thecolonies, in the form of both loans and grants, and to the less developed countries of the independent Commonwealth, principally in the form of loans. Bilateraleconomic assistance from the United Kingdom to non-Commonwealth countries has so far been regarded as exceptional, and accounts for only a small proportionof our total effort.21. In the field of multilateral assistance, we have made the second largestsubscription (the biggest being that of the United States) to the capital of theInternational Bank and its smaller affiliate, the International Finance Corporation,and we will be making the second largest contribution to the resources of theproposed new International Development Association (I.D.A.). Proportionatecontributions to these bodies are linked to quotas in the International monetary fund, where it is in the United Kingdom&apos;s interest to have a relatively large quota.We are also now making the second largest contribution to United Nationstechnical assistance programmes. These various contributions have in generalbeen in support of programmes of assistance to all the member countries of the institutions concerned (although the larger part of our payments to the international bank were earmarked for its loans to the Commonwealth in the first place) and,with the creation of I.D.A. and our increased support for the United Nationstechnical assistance programmes, we will in the future be playing a larger partthan before in aid for non-Commonwealth Countries. But all these amounts stillrepresent only a minor part in our effort, which remains predominately in theCommonwealth and on a bilateral basis.Size of Present Expenditure22. In 1958, when the United Kingdom balance of payments was benefitingfrom a substantial improvement in the terms of trade, it was decided to adopta flexible policy of more liberal lending, because our larger current surplus enabled us to do more to help primary producing. countries who were suffering fromprecisely those factors which led to the improvement in our own position. Thisled to the Commonwealth Assistance Loans under the arrangements announced at the time of the Montreal Conference in 1958. Largely as a result of these loans, and including the loans made to India, a total expenditure from UnitedKingdom public funds on economic and technical assistance to all overseas countries and territories rose from  75 millions in the financial year 1957-58 to  100 millions in 1958-59, and is continuing to rise sharply in the current year 1959-60. the out-turn for the current year is still subject to variation, depending in part on therate at which the recipients take advantage of the facilities provided to them, butthe total of the expenditure, on economic and technical assistance this year islikely to be about  150 millions.   This would represent a doubling of this
expenditure between the two years 1957-58 and 1959-60. These figures includeamounts channelled through the International Bank and United Nations technical assistance programmes. They exclude amounts provided for overseas countries as military assistance, certain emergency expenditure, certain relief funds, andother miscellaneous amounts; these between them have been amounting to roughlya further  30 millions a year. All these figures exclude private capital of all kindsgoing from the United Kingdom to countries overseas.Limitations on the United Kingdom Contribution23. The total aid of the United Kingdom to under-developed countries, thoughlarge in comparison with that of most countries, is a very small proportion of our total production or even of our domestic investment: it is equivalent to about one-third of one year&apos;s normal growth of production. But to maintain that assistance, and even more to increase it substantially, presents problems for thebudget and the balance of payments. At a time when our domestic resources are fully employed, the Government must, to provide this assistance, take measuresto ensure that the nation reduces by an equal amount its own expenditures, whether in the field of Government services, of public or private investment, or of private consumption. Aid cannot be created from thin air; it can only be found byforgoing the use for other purposes of real resources, and, to the extent that othersavings are inadequate for all that we want, this means increased taxation. Thepublic will not acquiesce in this unless they can be convinced of the urgency ofthe need. Moreover, even if the aid is soundly financed in this way, this providesno complete guarantee that it can be transferred across the exchanges withoutdamaging the balance of payments. For this purpose we must also be competitiveenough to ensure that the released resources can be employed to secure increasedexport earnings sufficient to cover the aid provided. Otherwise our reserves will fall, or our short-term indebtedness increase, which, taking one year with another,we cannot afford.24. The immediate balance of payments outlook is now far less promisingthan it was in 1958, and the possibility is that during 1960 we shall run into deficit1on combined current and capital account. That is to say, we shall be lending more on Government and private account than we shall be earning in the shape of acurrent surplus. (The term lending is used advisedly, since outright grants are treated as current account payments for the purpose of balance of paymentsstatistics.) It is arguable that the flexible policy adopted in 1958 is such that it canbe implemented in a way enabling us to reduce our overseas lending now. But thisis true only to a limited extent. One reason for this is that commitments incurred in principle at a particular time may result in expenditure some time later. Anotheris that our programme of assistance to the colonies, for which we have special responsibilities, is on a five-year basis. It is true that there is no similar forwardcommitment over a period of years to independent Commonwealth countries, let alone non-Commonwealth countries, but even there, when we are attempting toplay our part in dealing with long-term problems of development, it is hardlypracticable to contribute only spasmodically. To do so would seriously reducethe value of our effort and weaken our influence on others.25. In spite of these factors there is some scope for regulating the flow of our assistance in the period immediately ahead, but in attempting to do so we will find ourselves between two conflicting pressures. On the one hand, there are the growing demands from the less developed countries themselves and the representations from the United States that we, as well as Continental Europe,should do more to meet them; in many cases there will be arguments from thepoint of view of the United Kingdom&apos;s own political and trade interests for movingin this direction, and the tendency will certainly be for the level of United Kingdomassistance to rise still further. On the other hand, there are our concerns about the budgetary and balance of payments implications. So far as the budget is concerned,if our aid is to increase, it will be a question of making budgetary provision for itand of convincing Parliament and the public of the desirability of this. From thepoint of view of the effects on our balance of payments, we believe that we canmost safely increase the resources allocated for lending abroad and other formsof economic assistance if we do so in company with other advanced countries. Solong as British export industries are competitive, we believe that multilateral
untied lending suits, our position best, and that we can hope that the foreign exchange earnings from our share in the trade so financed will at the least cover,the amounts we lend. This is illustrated by the fact that the value of contracts wonby United Kingdom firms for projects financed by the International Bank has been considerably more than the funds made available to the Bank by the UnitedKingdom though this is partly accounted for by the fact that in the earlier yearswe restricted fairly severely the rate at which the Bank could use these sterlingfunds. Thus, if any increase in our overseas lending on Government account which takes place is matched by comparable increases in the lending of the otherindustrialised countries, substantially in the form of untied lending, we ought notto incur balance of payments difficulties as a result. Even if a certain amount ofthe aid given internationally is tied, that at least may be less damaging to our economic position than would be a situation in which we found ourselves carrying a disproportionate share of the total aid in all forms, in much the same way as ourrelative economic position suffers if we carry a disproportionate defence burden.It must be recognised that it will not be easy to reverse the recent trend, which hasbeen towards more and not less tying of international lending; we are submittinga separate paper on this problem.V.-CO-ORDINATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOMS CONTRIBUTIONS26. The United Kingdom&apos;s expenditure on overseas economic and technical assistance consists both of voted money and of issues from the Consolidated fund which do not pass through Departmental Votes. The voted money is administered by the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, and the Commonwealth relations office. As regards the sums which do not pass through votes, the Colonial Officeadministers the Exchequer loans to the colonies and issues to the colonial development Corporation; Export Credits Guarantee Department administersloans under Section 3 of the Export Guarantee Acts; and the Treasury, with theBank of England as their fiscal agents, have dealt with the United Kingdomsubscriptions to the International Bank and the International Finance Corporation,and similar arrangements will apply to the United Kingdom contribution to theproposed International Development Association. Control of this expenditure is exercised by departments and the Treasury, in accordance with the normalarrangements for control of expenditure of monies voted by Parliament or issued from the consolidated fund.27. Apart from this financial control, a number of Inter-Departmental OfficialCommittees, such as the Africa Committee, which are concerned with regionalquestions consider, among other things, problems of development in those regions.In other cases, such as the problem of India or the question of a new international development Association, problems of development have been consideredinter-departmentally at ad hoc meetings arranged for the purpose, and by theCommittee on Development Policy since they were brought into being.28. In our view it should be the function of the Development PolicyCommittee, reporting to the Economic Steering Committee, to keep the whole field of development, and expenditure in this field, under review. It seems to usimportant to try to look at the general problem of development as a whole, and notmerely to deal piecemeal with particular requests or proposals for expenditurearising from it. This was the reason for setting up the Committee on UnitedKingdom External Investment as a sub-committee of the Economic steering committee. They have produced one report and are in the course of preparing asecond, but their work is primarily statistical. Their functions could be absorbed by the Development Policy Committee which provide a forum where developmentproblems which do not naturally fall into.the province of any other committeecan be examined. The Development Policy Committee should keep a watch onthe soale of total Government expenditure in this field, particularly in relation toour balance of payments prospects; and they might generally co-ordinate (under;the Steering Committee) the activities of the Government in the field ofdevelopment. These functions should not in any way displace normal departmental responsibilities, or the normal relationship between the Treasury and otherdepartments in matters of Government expenditure.
VI.-CO-ORDINATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES and institutions OF THE WESTThe Group of Eight (Development Assistance Group) :&apos;..:/ .v;29. In the field of international co-ordination of aid questions attention isnow focussed on the arrangements Which have very recently been agreed in Paris,on the initiative of the United States, for a series of meetings between a group of eight countries* to discuss &quot;various aspects of co-operation in their efforts and to consult with such multilateral organisations as the International Bank for reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank &quot;. the title &quot; Development Assistance Group &quot;has more recently been proposed for thesegatherings. We will be submitting separate papers on particular questions whichmay be discussed in these meetings, and the attitude to be taken by United kingdom representatives in the Group will require consideration from time to time as mattersprogress. But we set out below a certain amount of general background material.We have also attempted to identify the main questions to be dealt with by theDevelopment Assistance Group and the principles which should underlie theUnited Kingdom approach to them.Previous Moves30. There have been several previous moves over the past few years with aview to new measures to co-ordinate Western aid to the less developed countries.There have been various reasons for this the feeling that the West is at a disadvantage in this respect as compared with the Soviet bloc; apprehension thatthe debtor countries may seek to play one creditor country off against another;fear of a credit competition between the exporting countries; a desire to exercise a moderating influence on the ambitions of the developing countries; and a belief that it would be useful to make a concerted attempt to match the supply of capitalwith the demands on it.31. A year or so ago the Federal German Government assumed the role ofthe most active proponent of these ideas, and some discussion took place, though not in open session, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Bankin Washington in September 1959. But at that stage the United States had not made up their minds. Germany&apos;s idea of some new and comprehensivearrangement received little support, though the President of the International Bankundertook to examine the matter. The creation of the Group of Eight has come about because of a marked and rapid change of attitude on the part of the UnitedStates. In this the United States desire to see more aid provided by Europe has played a major part. But it cannot be assumed from this that the United states has been converted to the view that completely new and comprehensive institutionalarrangements are required.Existing Arrangements32. In practice it has by no means been the case that each of the western countries has gone it alone in this field. An important part of their effort ischannelled collectively through the complex of institutions having their origins inthe Bretton Woods conference especially the International Bank, with its newerand smaller affiliate, the International Finance Corporation, which is concernedexclusively with assistance to private enterprises. To these there may soon beadded the International Development. Association, as a further affiliate of theBank, designed to provide funds on more flexible terms than the Bank can do.The International Monetary Fund provides short-term foreign exchange assistanceto countries in balance of payments difficulties, and not development capital; butit is an important part of this complex of institutions, all of which operate so faras possible by associating their assistance with bilateral finance from governments or private sources in dealing with particular situations. The volume of bilateralfinance is of course much greater than the amounts going through the international institutions. To take other examples of Western co-operation, the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) provided the focal point for* The eight countries are,Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdomand the United States, and the Commission of the European Economic Community will also participate.The United States has also proposed that Japan should join the Group.
combined rescue operations for France and Turkey in 1958, when the international monetary Fund and the United States joined with the other European countries in providing foreign exchange assistance. Again, the Colombo Plan arrangementsprovide a valuable forum for discussion of the development problems of Southand South-East Asia, though the final contributions of the West to that area arein no way channelled through a single fund.33. Of some importance also, in our view, as a model for the future, are thearrangements made in August 1958, and again in March 1959, when a consortiumof donor countries was brought together under the aegis of the International Bankto concert, through meetings in Washington, programmes of assistance towardsthe Indian Second Five-year Plan. There are now good prospects that these arrangements will be extended and developed in connexion with India&apos;s ThirdFive-year Plan (on which we have reported separately) as a result of recent talks between the United Kingdom and the United States. The agreement reached fora mission of three prominent Western bankers, including Sir Oliver Franks, to visit India and Pakistan should play an important part both in influencing Indiatowards more realistic planning and in keeping up momentum towards a concertedWestern effort to help her.Scope for Increased Co-ordination34. All this does not, of course, add up to a comprehensive arrangement for detailed budgeting and for co-ordinating all Western aid. It has always seemedto the United Kingdom that there would be formidable difficulties in the way ofany such arrangement. The donor countries are not in a position to commit themselves, individually or collectively, to total amounts of aid for any long periodahead. It is doubtful whether they could between them make any realisticappreciation of the total amounts which they ought to aim to provide over such aperiod. It is arguable that the attempt at such collective planning would not merelyconfront the less developed countries with a co-ordinated attitude on the part ofthe donors, but would also confront the donors with concerted and therebyreinforced pressure on them from the needy countries. Moreover, most of the major capital-exporting countries have spheres where their own particularresponsibilities or interests lie in the case of the United Kingdom, the colonies,and then the independent Commonwealth; in the case of France, the territoriesassociated with her in Africa; in the case of the United States, Latin America andCountries such as Formosa, in which she has an important political or strategicstake. It is not to be expected that these countries could agree that control oftheir aid in those directions should be taken out of their hands.35. Nevertheless there is large scope for improving consultation on the policies and methods to be adopted by the Western countries, and for seeking toreduce frictions. This would clearly be in the interests of the Western effortgenerally. Further, since we attach importance to the concept that the UnitedKingdom should aim to effect her overseas lending in company with lending fromother countries, it will be in the United Kingdom&apos;s interests to explore any new arrangement which would help to bring this about.36. It is also Clear that influence can best be brought to bear on the planning of the less developed countries if this is done through some multilateralarrangement, rather than through bilateral governmental channels. It wouldrequire considerable space to deal fully with this question, which, in certaincircumstances, could raise difficult problems as to what are the correct economic policies for a particular recipient country to follow, and to what extent the donorcountries are entitled to press their own beliefs on others. In practice, however, itis often the case that outside observers have little difficulty about forming a view on particular situations. It is generally recognised that the International Bankhas in this respect exerted an important influence for the good, without incurringthe political odium that would be inevitable if an individual donor Governmenttried to secure the same results. But the International Bank&apos;s resources of suitablehigh-level people are limited. To the extent that donor Governments have to try to achieve similar results by other means, the political difficulties will be reduced if they act collectively rather than individually. The mission of the three Westernbankers to India and Pakistan, with the blessing of the Western Governmentsthough not specifically on their behalf, may help to break new ground in dealingwith this problem.
37. Against this background it seems to us that the possible subjects to be examined by the Development Assistance Group might include the following:(i) Sharing the burden; &quot;&apos;(ii) Methods of operation;(iii) The terms of aid;(iv) Discussion of priorities.The following paragraphs add some further brief comments on each of thesequestions.Sharing the Burden *38. It may be very difficult to reach agreement on a comparative statementof how much each of the advanced countries is now doing in relation to its resources.We should support any collective studies designed to clarify the facts and figures,and we believe that our present performance would compare well with that ofany other country, with the possible exception of France. There seems no doubt at all that Germany is doing proportionately little, and one major object of any international exercise must be to influence Germany to do more. It appears thatthe United States do not accept the idea of comparing burdens on this sort of basis,but they will certainly be concerned to put pressure on particular countries todo more.39. As a result of the recent discussions in Paris, O.E.E.C. is undertaking a comprehensive study of the amount and types of aid provided for the less-developed areas of the world (including the less developed European countries)from 1950 to 1959 by the more industrialised countries of Western Europe and north America. The results of these studies should be of value for the work ofthe Development Assistance Group, and it may well prove desirable for theinformation to be brought up to date from time to time, and perhaps published as a full record of what the West is doing in this field.Methods of Operation40. To the extent that Western aid is to be actually channelled throughmultilateral organisations, we believe that the Bretton Woods institutions shouldcontinue to serve this purpose. It can be assumed that the United States willcontinue to take the lead in resisting proposals to give this role to the united nations, which would involve participation of the Communist countries, although some of the smaller European countries would favour this course. It is too soon to decide what functions a reorganised O.E.E.C. might perform in the field of aid,but at least it might continue to carry out studies on the subject as already mentioned. It is possible that the six countries of the European economic community will seek to build up the European Investment Bank on their overseas investment Fund, in which case the problem would be to harmonise their activitieswith those of the International Bank. But it is very likely that the bulk of Westernaid will continue to be on a bilateral basis. We consider that the most practical and desirable method of concerting these bilateral funds would be by a developmentof the consortium idea, preferably under the aegis of the International Bank. Inthe first instance the aim should be to secure such arrangements for further assistance to India. If this is achieved, the donor countries could go on either towiden the scope of this consortium, possibly to cover Pakistan as well as India,or to set up further and separate consortia to deal with other countries. We must recognise, that, if such arrangements are made with regard to the commonwealth countries in which the United Kingdom has a special interest, the United kingdom could hardly resist participation in similar arrangements for other countries aswell. This should, however, entail no radical departure from the basis that our aid goes predominantly to the Commonwealth. One of our objects should be tosecure an increased German contribution in any future consortium arrangements.The Terms of Aid41.. We have already argued that it would suit the Unied Kingdbm&apos;s positionbest if. the advanced countries generally would agree to extend the bulk of theiraid in united form-&apos; This should therefore be one of the major questions for international discussion, and we will submit separate and more detailed recommendations on this.   It may also be necessary at some stage to consider
other aspects of the forms and terms of aid. For example, we may be pressed by the United States and Germany to adopt a system of Government guarantees for private investment overseas&apos; a measure which we regard as --inappropriate for super-imposition on the well-established methods of channelling private investment from this country, and one liable to impair the proper functioning ofprivate capital in seeking out loan-worthy borrowers and potentially profitableenterprises.Discussion of Priorities42. The total of aid from the advanced countries is at present unevenlydistributed over the less developed world and some of the poorest and mostbackward countries receive a smaller share than others who are not quite so badlyplaced. It is not surprising that this should be so. To some extent it is becausethose who have already made some progress are in a better position effectively to use aid. But in any case, for reasons already set out, it is not to be expected&quot;that the donor countries (including the United Kingdom) would consider poolingall their contributions, to be distributed according to some criterion of equity and need. But there is room for discussion whether the donor countries, after taking account of their prior charges, so to speak, should make a greater concerted effort in other areas which are of major interest to the West as a whole. In our viewIndia is an outstanding case where such an approach has proved valuable.43. A particular problem of priorities will arise for the new international development Association (I.D.A.). Its parent body, the International Bank, hasbeen able to screen applications for loans by applying criteria, not merely of the borrower^ need and the technical soundness of projects, but also of the loan-worthiness of the borrower and the project. These latter tests will not serve theI.D.A. in the same way, since its function will be to provide finance on flexibleterms for countries and projects which are not &quot;bankable &quot;.44. It is understood that the International Bank has been asked to draw up,and submit to the Development Assistance Group, a list of desirable projects forwhich, for one reason or another, finance has not been available. If this were intended merely to provide additional evidence (if such were needed) of the greatneed for development capital, it would in itself do no harm. But our attitude wouldbe unfavourable to any suggestion that the Group should concern itself with therelative priorities of particular projects such as might be included in the list- a task which would and probably will fall more naturally to the I.D.A., when it comes into being. The I.D.A., moreover, will provide a forum where the less developed countries themselves will have an opportunity, as they should, to voice then-reactions to the selection of projects.VII.-SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS45. The Committee&apos;s appreciation of these problems may now be summarisedas follows. There are in the less developed countries of the non-Communist worldover 1,000 million people existing on extremely low incomes--in India  23 a yearper head and these populations are rapidly increasing. To raise these income levels, a rate of investment is required which they cannot achieve unaided, except possibly by the imposition of rigorous and efficient totalitarian regimes. Amongthe non-Communist under-developed countries, India occupies a key position inantithesis to that of China among the Communist countries, and their relativerates of economic advance will be a matter of major importance.46. This situation has entered a new phase in two important respects. On theone hand, the needs of these countries have emerged on a larger scale and in amore pressing manner, calling for a substantial increase in the already large volumeof economic assistance to them. On the other hand, there has been a change in therelative positions of the United States, whose gold and dollar outflow has risen toa rate which she cannot allow to continue, and of Western Europe, which is nowin a much stronger economic position. The United States is therefore pressing for europe to take a bigger share of the burden of aid; this has been an important factor in the recent United States initiative, resulting in arrangements for a group of eight Western countries to hold a series of discussions On various aspects ofco-operation in their efforts. &apos;       ;    1 -  ^ . .
47. A - large increase has already taken place in the annual amount ofexpenditure from United Kingdom public funds on economic and technical assistance to overseas countries and territories from  75 millions in 1957-58 toprobably about  150 millions in the present financial year, including fundschannelled through the International Bank and the United Nations. In the coming year we are likely to incur a significant though not critical balance of paymentsdeficit on current and capital account, taken together. The scope for. counteringthis by curtailing our overseas aid is limited. In general, a high level of UnitedKingdom lending can be maintained without strain on the economy only if webudget for it in the disposition of our resources, which we hope will continue toincrease. Subject to that, balance of payments difficulties are more likely to be avoided, if the other industrialised countries join in overseas lending, and especially if they do so without tying their loans to their own exports.48. In the light of this appreciation, the Committee&apos;s recommendations onthe two questions set out in the terms of reference are as follows:(i) Co-ordination of United Kingdom ContributionsThe Development Policy Committee, reporting to the Economic steering committee, should co-ordinate the various Government activities in this field,and should keep under review the scale of the resulting government expenditure, particularly in relation to the United Kingdom&apos;s balance ofpayments position and prospects and to other calls on its resources.(ii) International Co-ordinationA single comprehensive machinery for co-ordination of internationallending is hardly practicable, or even desirable, but there is scope for muchmore consultation on policies and methods of operation. The impendingdiscussions in the Development Assistance Group provide a new and importantopportunity for this. The United Kingdom&apos;s attitude on some particularaspects of these matters should be as set out below:(a) We should continue to support the Bretton Woods group of institutions,especially the International Bank, as the main channel for the Wesfsmultilateral aid.(b) We should aim to secure continuation of the arrangements so far madeunder the Bank&apos;s aegis for concerting the various bilateral contributions to India, on which we have reported separately. We should be preparedto apply these or similar arrangements to the problems of some othercountries also.(c) We should support collective studies designed to clarify the facts about how much the various countries of the West are already doing.(d) One of the major objectives should be to influence Germany (whoserelative effort clearly falls far short of that of the other major western countries) towards a bigger contribution, specially in future programmes of assistance to India.(e) The United Kingdom should explore in these international discussions thepossibility of agreement to put an increased part of Western aid on anuntied basis.March, I960.
