Document is the property of her britannic majesty*s government cp(76) 45copy no    g I5 July 1976cabinetCUTTING THE COST OF THE CIVIL SERVICE:ABOLITION OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for industry.        It was announced in the Budget Statement that; because of theindustrial consequences. Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on petrol-drivenvehicles would not be abolished.    Nevertheless, and despite the very short time that has elapsed since the Statement, the Lord Privy Seal attachescritical importance to VED abolition in the context of our objective to cut the cost of the Civil Service by  140 million in 1978-79.   He takes the viewthat not only would there be a major saving of etaff, but mat a failure on thepart of the Treasury to concede it could impair the willingness of our colleagues to co-operate wholeheartedly in making the difficult and painfuldecisions in their own spheres of responsibility that are necessary to ensurethe achievement of our objective.2.        We accept entirely that if that objective were imperilled the widertask of bringing aggregate public expenditure within the limit set in lastFebruary&apos;s Public Expenditure White Paper could be compromised.    Wehave not therefore lightly maintained our objections to VED abolition throughthe successive Ministerial exchanges on the subject since last autumn.   Wemust, however, keep matters in scale.   We are concerned here with about, 000 prospective new recruits, some of them to be engaged in Swanseawhich is of course in an area of high unemployment.   These people will moreman pay their way in revenue-gathering; given, in addition, the effects on thecar industry, there is a better case for looking for staff economies where theeffects will be less likely to be counter-productive.    We recognise that VEDabolition is associated also with, important if less urgent objectives in thefield of transport policy.   But the link between VED abolition and transport policy is basically an indirect one.    It is not so much the abolition of VEDas such but the consequential increase in petrol prices which provides themain connection with transport policy.    The recent Budget illustrates that itis possible to move in this direction while still retaining VED as a usefulsource of revenue.I
THE FISCAL ARGUMENT3.        We take first the fiscal argument for retaining VED, not because itis more immediately important than the industrial argument but because ithas received less attention than it warrants in the interchanges at bothMinisterial and official level.    The essence of the fiscal argument iB thatto substitute higher petrol taxation for VED, which is what would be entailedin order to maintain revenue-neutrality and prevent a further and whollyunacceptable widening of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR),would amount in practice to a serious erosion of revenue-raising capacitythat would make still more difficult the essential task of bringing the. PSBRdown to more manageable proportions over the years immediately ahead.4.       Even with the revisions to public expenditure programmes that were announced in the February White Paper, and allowing for the need progresssively to reduce the PSBR, we are as a Government going to be faced in theperiod up to 1970-80 with a formidable revenue-raising problem.    We cannotlook as in the past to direct taxation for a major contribution.   On thecontrary, as we acknowledged in the Public Expenditure White Paper, theincome tax burden now bites too harshly on low incomes while the high levelof marginal tax rates is a serious threat to the morale am effectiveness of management.   Any easing of the burden of income tax will increase the needfor revenue from other sources.   In this process petrol taxation will have toplay a significant part; but the very real constraints on our freedom ofaction here need to be recognised.    They are, most notably, the priceleverage exerted by the Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC)cartel, which we aro virtually powerless to influence; the importance of petrol in the Retail Price Index (RPI) and hence to wage bargaining in the context of counter-inflation policy; and the need to maintain, in the interestsof both industrial and counter-inflation policy, an appropriate balance between the price of petrol and derv.    The presence of such constraintscalls into doubt any assumption that if VED on petrol-driven vehicles were abolished, at a loss to the revenue of  625 million in the current financialyear and of a steadily rising sum beyond this (as the car populationcontinues to grow) in future years, the loss could be readily recouped viahigher petrol taxation.   It is likely that in practice other taxes would haveto be increased, or entirely fresh sources of revenue found, against a background, to repeat, of general fiscal stringency.5.        We note, in passing, that every other European Economic Community(e.c.) country has, as we now have, a three-tier structure of motoringtaxes comprising VED, petrol tax and vehicles sales tax.    So does theUnited States.   All these countries find it necessary to spread the taxburden on motoring in this way.2
THE INDUSTRIAL ARGUMENT6.        Any substantial and sudden increase in the price of petrol would strengthen the tendency which has been apparent over the last year or twofor United Kingdom car buyers to switch from larger to smaller cars.Fuel economy Is an increasingly emphasised selling factor and this is normally related to engine sise.   Import penetration has been growingparticularly in the mini segment of the market and is now Hearing 50 per cent;penetration is much less in the size range immediately above this (taken ascars between 1200 cc and 2000 cc and so covering the vast bulk of all; carsproduced in this country) and is of the order of 20-25 per cent.    TheSociety of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) estimated that if carbuyers responded to the sudden increase in the petrol price following theabolition of VED in a way similar to their response to substantial pricerises over the past few years, demand for cars under 1200 cc would increase by about 20 per cent with comparable losses in demand for cars over that level.    Import penetration in the small car segment could thus be expectedto increase by up to 10 per cent.    They estimated that this might cost thebalance of payments perhaps  20-25 million.   Apart from the loss ofbusiness to imports, a shift downwards in demand would be detrimental tothe industry^ profitability, given the close link which exists at almost everylevel between car selling prices and the profitability of the individual model.7.        The particular vulnerability of the industry to the abolition of VED lies in the fact mat the industry has at present only one car available in anynumbers in the mini segment (the nearly 20 year old (British Ley land (BL)Mini for which the proposed replacement is not expected to be effectivelyestablished in the market until 1980), compared with a very wide range of competing imported models.   Even with the introduction of the Ford Fiestaat the end of this year we will still be highly dependent in this area on imports.   Ford estimate that imports will still account fox 43 per cent ofregistrations in the mini sector on average between 1976 and 1980.   Apartfrom the consequences for the level of imports, a change coming before thenew BL Mini has been introduced and established itself could be damagingfor BL.   If there is an artificial stimulus to imports in this sector before1980 with a demand which the existing Mini could not satisfy in output termseven apart from the competitive advantages of the imported models, existingloyalties to Leyland products will be lost and the new Mini will have to be launched against a difficult background which may threaten its profitabilityand viability.   This would be particularly serious since the new Mini is of central importance In BL&apos;s model plan and of key importance in allowing BLdistributors to have a wide enough range to offer.8.        The effects on employment can arise both as a direct consequence ofa shift of demand from the medium range of cars where the great volume ofUnited Kingdom production rests and also from the threat to the success ofthe Mini replacement which the consolidation of the position of the foreignsmall care in the market in the period up to 1980 would constitute.   In the motor Industry Tripartite Group (of which Mr Jack Jones and Mr Hugh Scanlonare members aB well as the chief executives of the four major carmanufacturers) the view has been strongly expressed that job security depends3
on the stability of the environment for industry planning.    The Group:sagreed view was that the abolition of VED and its replacement byincreasee in petrol tax would be disturbing and damaging for theindustry.    The union members of the Group continue to press strongly the case for selective controls of imports of cars to protect jobs, with considerable support from the manufacturers, and the threat of increased imports due to the abolition of VED would very much strengthen their pressure.    They believe, rightly in our view, that abolishing VED byloading the burden on to the petrol tax would add to unemployment by reducing the number of jobs in the car industry.   This loss of jobs hasto be added to the Civil Service clerical jobs that would not materialisein Swansea and elsewhere.9.        A further relevant consideration is the treatment of company carsas a taxable fringe benefit.    Our colleagues will be aware that the fringebenefit proposal has stimulated considerable criticism from the motor industry.    We have offered full and genuine consultation with the industryso as to see how far the possible adverse effects on the industry can beameliorated.    This issue still remains open.    But it is relevant to theproposal to abolish VED in two respects.    First, the decision not to abolish VED was received by the motor industry with considerable relief.They would find it incomprehensible if the Government were to reversethis decision, particularly bearing in mind that the Budget Statementemphasised industrial considerations as the major reason for retaining the duty.    Second, whatever the outcome of the fringe benefit discussions,the industry would be shocked and demoralised, and in our view withsome justification, if after emphasising to us the difficulties that theywould face if fiscal measures encouraged a shift towards small cars,we were to make a change which would almost certainly have preciselythis result.   The credibility of consultation, on which we have placedconsiderable emphasis, would be severely, perhaps irreparably,undermined.CONCLUSION10.       In the light of these considerations we conclude that the prospectivestaff savings are insufficient ground for abolishing VED on petrol-drivenvehicles.    In the first place, given on the one hand the revenuerequirements that lie ahead and in particular the paramount importanceof curtailing the PSBR, and on the other hand the practical constraintsthat apply in the field of petrol taxation, we cannot afford the effectivenarrowing of the tax base that abolition would imply; we should in practice be giving up  625 million a year for nothing!   Second, we cannot sensiblycontemplate action that would further open up the domestic market toforeign small cars, and thereby put at risk the efforts mat British Leyland,Ford, Chrysler and Vauxhall will be making over the next few criticalyears to regain their share of mis section of the market.    While theadministrative cost of collecting VED 1b admittedly high relative to other important taxes (though arguably not as high as it appears because the4
coat of vehicle registration would presumably still have to be borne evenif VED did not exist), the duty does seem to work to our nationaladvantage in present circumstances.    Zt is acting in effect as a non-tariff barrier of a kind which our more nationalistic competitors, notably the French and Japanese, unashamedly deploy.    It is impossible toimagine that any of them would make a fiscal change which would increasethe vulnerability of one of their major industries.    Third, a change of mind now on VED, after the decision announced in the Budget speech onprior industrial grounds, would deal a severe blow to the credibility ofour pledge, notably in the National Economic Development Councillast autumn, to give priority to manufacturing industry in framing our economic and fiscal policies.    The implications of that for the currentlyvery successful work on industrial strategy would be very serious indeed.D W HE VTreasury Chambers5 July 19765
