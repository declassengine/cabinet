^ttB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 4812 July 1976FOOD SUBSIDY PROGRAMME 1976-77 and 1977-78Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection and Paymaster general,        Among his proposals for reducing public expenditure in 1977-78the Chief Secretary has suggested (CP(76) 42) that food subsidies in thatyear should be cut by  200 million.   I think my colleagues should be aware of what the effectB of such a cut would be.2. The 1975 Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393) providedfor food subsidies to be run down as follows:- m.  (1976 survey prices)1975-76 6351976-77 4081977-78 2801978-79 841979-80 56The Chief Secretary is now proposing that the 1977-78 stage in theprogramme should be omitted and that the run down should be acceleratedby one year.    Because the figure of  84 million would cover little morethan lp on a pint of milk, the effect of the Chief Secretary^ proposal would be to reduce the milk subsidy to that level, and abolish the othersubsidies, within about 12 months from now - in other words, broadlywithin the period of the present incomes policy agreement with the TradesUnion Congress (TUC).3.        The existing programme, involving a reduction in food subsidies inthis current financial year of  227 million (at 1976 survey prices) willitself cause substantial price increases between now and next April.    Itwill entail abolishing the subsidy on tea, and reducing the level of each ofthe other subsidies.   Because falls in the price of milk for manufacturingpurposes have the effect of increasing the deficit in the Milk Fund whichhas to be met by the subsidy, it will be necessary to bring forward from january 1977 to September next an increase in the price of milk.   This is contrary to an undertaking we gave in the House of Commons at the time ofthe last farm price review but if the Minister of Agriculture agrees I am1COPY NO    SICABINET
prepared to accept it as unavoidable.    None of these   price increases willbe palatable to the TUC and our supporters, but they can be defended asbeing within the existing programme which was known tc the TUC when they agreed to the pay limits for the next incomes policy year,4.        But to achieve the accelerated run-down asked for by the chief secretary would mean that price increases linked to subsidy reductions would have to take place in every single month from September 1976 to april 1977.   These increases would be additional to the heavy price increases on subsidised foods expected for reasons unrelated to reductions in subsidy.   The total effect is estimated to be that price increases on the six subsidised foods alone might add l-l  per cent on the Retail Price Indexover the 1976-77 financial year and a further f-1 per cent over the 1977-78financial year - in all about 8 per cent on the Food Index.    (These figurestake no account of a possible devaluation of the Green Pound.   I cannotemphasise too strongly the importance of avoiding any move on that front,particularly in relation to milk products and milling wheat.)   The Increasesbefore August 1977 include at least 2p a pint on milk (24 per cent, all dueto the. subsidy cut); 3p on a large loaf of bread (17 per cent, two-thirdsdue to the subsidy cut); 14p a pound on cheese (28 per cent, three-quartersdue to the subsidy cut); and 12p-13p a pound on butter (31 per cent, about one-third due to the subsidy cut).5.        These increases will hit hardest the most vulnerable sections ofthe community whom we have tried to help through the food subsidyprogramme - pensioners, those on low incomes, and those with large families.    We subridised the cheaper sources of nourishment to help the poor; hence, sharp price increases in subsidised foods mustdiscriminate against mem, as they have no acceptable alternative to turn to.   Prices of these basic necessities are likely to go up considerablyfaster than the non-basic foods.   Some of those most affected are alreadydisappointed by the slower phasing in of the full Child Benefit Scheme,and will be affected by increased charges for school meals in the spring.The report from the General Council of the TUC which was presented tothe special conference of the TUC last month reaffirmed their belief inthe value of food subsidies in giving special help to the least well off.I do not believe the TUC or our supporters in general would be preparedto accept action on our part to effect increases in the prices of food overand above those caused by reasons beyond our control and by the need tomeet our existing programme for reducing the level of subsidies.6.        My conclusion is that we cannot go along with the Chief Secretary&apos;proposal for a further cut of  200 million in food subsidies in 1977-78without putting at risk both the maintenance of this year&apos;s pay policy andthe possibility of negotiating an acceptable policy for the following year.I have considered carefully whether there is any lesser cut which we couldadopt but I have come to the conclusion that the most I could safely offeris  50 million.   Even this would involve abolishing the subsidies on bread and  Lour in April next year; but it would waftble the increases in the priceof milk and the reductions in and eventual abolition of the subsidies on 
butter and cheese to be phased over a slightly longer period, and soreduce the pressure on the critical first half of next year.7,        I therefore recommend that the food subsidy programme for1977-78 should be cut by  50 million.    Recognising the need to reducethe Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, one possible alternative whichI have put to the Chief Secretary would be to increase excise duties.The difference of  150 million between the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal and my own could be covered by, for example, an additional     on apint of beer and 3p on a packet of 20 cigarettes.    I am loath to make&quot;any recommendation which would increase prices or put up the retail price Index, but I would regard an increase in excise duties as likelyto be less repugnant to the TUC, as well as being a more tolerable step in terms of both social and nutritional policy, than the virtual elimination of food subsidies over the next 12 months.S w department of Price and Consumer Protection12 July 19763
