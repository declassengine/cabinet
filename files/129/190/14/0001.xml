DOCUMENT JS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJ STY*S government cp(76) 39 o ACOPY NO     811 July 1976CABINETCUTTING THE COST OF THE CIVIL service memorandum by the Lord Privy SealINTRODUCTION1.        I was invited by Cabinet at their meeting on 13 May 1976(CM(76) 4th Conclusions, Minute 3) to hold bilateral discussions withcolleagues to secure the maximum possible agreement, baaed on thepossibilities in Annexes A, B and C to CP(76) 9, on measures to cut the forecast 1978-79 cost of the Civil Service by  140 million.2.        The   140 million must all come from the civil Departments andamounts to 9 par cent from their total net expenditure - not 5 per cent asCabinet originally thought appropriate.   The Ministry of Defence (MOD)was excluded because it will by April 1979 save, as a result of DefenceReviews, some 40, 000 staff, about half of them United Kingdom based.AGREED SAVINGS3.       Annex V records the amounts saved by options which are acceptable to the Ministers concerned -  95 million, or  45 million short of the target to which we are publicly committed.4.        The effects of these cuts in relation to current strengths (Annex Y)and forecast strengths (Annexes V and W) vary from Department toDepartment - unfairly in the view of some colleagues.   But an equalpercentage cut for all would be even more unfair because it would take no account of relative work priorities or the practicability of sheddingcommitments.   Some Ministers have offered more than others; but,since we need all the agreed options, and no new ones have emerged, Isaw no scope in my discussions for evening out the burden.   It is now for cabinet to decide which of the disagreed options should be added.DISAGREED SAVINGS5.        The disagreed options from my original package, worth 43 million, are listed in Annex W, with the reasons for disagreement.Annex X gives other options listed in my previous paper; these remaineven less acceptable to Ministers.1
BRIDGING THE GAP6.        There is no way of making the saving without choosing amongstthe options in Annexes W and X.7.        The savings already agreed by Ministers include an element(generally 2 per cent or so) for &quot;good housekeeping&quot;.   This reflects the outcome of a detailed study in the past year by senior officials of thescope for cost-saving initiatives, including a fully comprehensive systemof staff inspection and the deployment of management services resources to give full emphasis to better working methods, cost cutting and costcontrol.    I hope my colleagues will **** a personal interest in this work.But I am satisfied that it would be rash to look for larger savings fromthat source,8.        The conclusion seems inescapable that we must take in all the options in Annex Win spite of the strong arguments against.    This would leave us just under 12 million short of  140 million, and, as I said in cp(76) 9, it is reasonable to assume that consequential savings will be enough to cover this.   I recommend accordingly.ABOLITION OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY (VED)9.        The biggest single &quot;disagreed&quot; saving is the abolition of VED,proposed by the Secretary of State for the Environment but disagreed bythe Secretary of State for Industry - CP(76) 41 gives the arguments.The saving la  12 million if we count only the savings in staff (3, 000)and in Post Office agency services.   But an annual  2 fee to cover theadministrative costs of the residual registration scheme would raise afurther  22 million.   It can therefore be argued that the total contribution,of TED abolition is  34 million.   As before, I have counted the saving as 12 million because on balance this seems right.   But our task would, ofcourse, be greatly eased if the general view was not only that VED couldbe abolished but also that it could fairly be counted as  34 million.10.      Without abolition we shall find  140 million only with extreme difficulty because we shall have to take, not only the whole of Annex W,but also some  12 million from Annex X.   This will involve some highlydisagreeable decisions.LEGISLATION11.      I was also asked, In consultation with the Lord President, to describe the legislative implications of this exercise.   Annex 2(i) sets out in detail the legislative implications of the agreed options in Annex V,and Annex Z(ii) the implications of the disagreed options in Annex W;the position is summarised in the introduction to these Annexes.   ThereIs one issue of consequence for the Cabinet to decide.   The agreedDepartment of the Environment proposal to save  ^ million by deferringthe statutory time limit to return certain buildings to Local Authorities,2
and Ilia disagreed proposal by the Lord Chancellor to save  700, 000 by reducing the size of juries to ten, both require legislation next Session.Both could be included in the Administration of Justice Bill, which onlyhas third priority in next Session&apos;s provisional programme.   The issuefor decision is whether, having regard to the saving involved and the factthat no Miscellaneous Provisions Bill will be needed next Session, tbeAdministration of Justice Bill should be given higher priority so as toensure its introduction next Session, although this would reduce the numberof other Bills in the provisional programme which could be introduced nextSeeaion.CONSULTATIONS12.       My colleagues have stressed that they need to consult with certainoutside interests and with the Departmental Staff Sides before settling indetail how their allotted savings should be made.   I have also undertaken to consult Hie National Staff Side before we reach and announce our conclusions.THE LONGER TERM13.      Worthwhile studies could - as 1 suggested in CP(76) 9 - be made into the administration of such manpower intensive policies as revenuecollection and the distribution of social security benefits.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State for Social Services and for employment are inclined to agree, and a small group of permanent secretaries is being set up to steer a preliminary feasibility study.   Suchlong-term studies could not lead to significant economies before the 19,80sand would involve transitional coBts.    But if we do not conduct them, andthen face their implications, the Civil Service will continue to grow.CONCLUSION14.       I invite my colleagues:-a. to accept the savings of  95 million in Annex V;b. to agree that the remainder of the  140 million befound by accepting all the savings in Annex W;c. to agree that they should have freedom, in the light offurther consultations, to vary in detail the ways in which their total savings are achieved;d. to give personal attention to the adequacy of staffinspection arrangements and management services activities in their Departments;e. to accept the need to quantify, and to weigh more heavilythan in the past, the staffing and administrative costs of all new policy proposals brought forward for consideration by colleagues;3

CutH of the extentindicated In Schedule V could be achieved but anything beyold this wouldmean that the Department and the SBC oould not meet their basicobligations under the Supplementary benefit Scheme.   The Chairman ofthe SBC has stated that a cut of this level could not in any circumstances be accepted by the Commission.Reduction of enforcement work to the level which a out of this size wouldrequire reduces the deterrent effect and increases the risk of losingmore money by lost contributions than would be gained by staff savings.The Income of the HI Fund could be Seriously affected.   Prom the publicpoint of view a large number of pension records would be adverselyaffeotsd because of contributions left unallocated to individual accounts.The Chairman of the SBC has stated that this measure, which would reduceeven the postal contact with their oldest claimants, would be a stickingpoint for the SBC.About  31m was recovered in 1974-75 from husbands who were liable tomaintain their wives, and vioe versa, and from parents liable to maintainthsir ohlldren.

Shaet  1rjssrswMre zmplkuteiks op the optiohsThere are two items which oi.&apos;.ld ba included in &amp; Finance Bill, iutA one in aliill already before Parliament this Session^ provided the ceceesaiyamc-rid-Tienta can be made in tine,.    Sevo.-a! ituns I-equli-e Scottish legislation, and depend iipo.i the Secretary of Ststp for Scotland giving theseproposals sufficient priority within his own liut of bill for nert SeRslon.   There are several items for which no suitable 3ill is in prospect,or for which a suitable Bill is planned but hs3 poor praopecta of finding a place r.eit Session because it is or-ly in tho third priority nr theReserve category; tut nsopt of theuu fi-e items for which alternatives are being sought by the responsible Departnfints, or which would bring only small savings.   There, should ba no need for a separate Mitoellaneoun Provioions Bill next Session to sweep up legislative proposals whioh offersignificant eavingR but cannot bp accommodated In wider legislation.There ara two items involving quite substantial savings which may depend upon giving higher priority to ft Bill in next Sossion&apos;s programme-ane thanit has at pisisent.   These are the DOE&apos;s agreed proposal to save  500,000 by deferring the deadline for compliance with the  Statutory requiroaentto hand back certain Government buildings to Local Authorities; and the Lord Chancellors disagreed proposal to save  700,000 by reducing thesise of juries to 10.   The latter item, but not the former, could be Included in the Home Secretary^ Criminal Justice Sill, which is in thesecond priority gmup in the provisional legislative progi-a-Trae and h^; quite a good prospect of proceeding next Session.   Both items oould beincluded in the Lord Chancel lor&apos;s Administration of Justice Bill, which is in the third priority group in the legislative programme and does nothave a good chance of proceeding next Session.   These savings oould be ensured by giving the Administration of Justioe Bill higher priority.Owing1 to the expected severe pressure on p&amp;rllaaentaiy time next Session, this would reduce the number of other Bills in the provisional programme which could be introduced; and it might well become impossible to proceed with one of the Bills in the second priority group for whichthere could otherwise have been room.1.
