HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?6) 49 COPY NO        8113 July 1976CABINET &quot;&quot;PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. At our discussion last Tuesday, the nature of our problem for nextyear became clear.    It is not one of shortage of resources.    True, asalways in recovery, bottlenecks will emerge in a few sectors, but by anypost-war standard output and employment will still be heavily depressedthroughout next year.    The real constraint is that we cannot get by now ornext year without extensive foreign borrowing, and that will not be forthcoming without foreign confidence in our power to handle our economydecisively and to break through to a position when we are again paying ou?way.2.        The first question, therefore, is whether what we are being asked todo is likely to restore confidence.    It is only five months since we publishedour last public expenditure White Paper.    That committed us to a strategy for getting through the next three years by rigid control to ensure that public expenditure took none of the increment of output.    To abandon it soquickly will not restore confidence: it will show only mat the BritishGovernment has neither confidence in its own policies, nor the resolution to resist foreign pressures.3.        To do what the Chancellor is asking, we shall have to announce thismonth a package of actions directed at public expenditure alone.    We shallbe forced both to reduce subsidies on some basic services and to take afurther slash at public sector capital programmes.4,        Cuts in subsidies will fall on rents, food or fares.    Like increases in Value Added Tax (VAT) or tobacco tax they put up the Retail Price Index(RPI),    On council rents, room for manoeuvre is in any event limited bythe need for legislation specifically to cut subsidies if we are to meet theCmnd 6393 targets.    That seems to me out of the question in presentcircumstances.    Politically, the limit to which we can go is in practicean increase of around 60p - the same as mis year.1
5 But the cuts on public capital programmes are even moremisguided - economically and politically.    We could not possibly achievesavings of the size requested without imposing a virtual moratorium, moreor less prolonged, on starting new council houses as well as on roadbuilding - local and national.    This would have no possible justificationin terms of relieving the pressure on the construction industry.    ThePublic Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) Report forecasts that evenwithout cuts, construction output in every year to 1980 will remain below1970 levels.   After shipbuilding, construction is our worst-hit industry.Unemployment is running at 13^ per cent.    Lees work means the deliberatecreation of higher unemployment there.     400 million off public sectorconstruction work will mean over 50, 000 jobs lost - with nothing to show for it since neither the spare labour nor the spare capacity can help theindustrial strategy at this stage,6.        To achieve major savings in expenditure next year the moratoriummust be announced this summer, inevitably with mounting effect on jobs thiscoming winter.  I do not see how we could justify such an abrupt U-turn inour policy from Cmnd 6393 when we said *The planned levels of expenditure for future years reflect the continuing high priority being accorded to housing^ to a situation where housing investment bears the brunt of a programme of public expenditure cuts.   At least when our apponentsimposed a construction moratorium in 1973 they had the justification of aserious overload on the industry - and even then they excluded housing androads.7.        These measures will in my view do serious, perhaps fatal politicaldamage.   The public sector unions - and they include not only the NationalUnion of Public Employees, the General-Municipal Workers Union, theNational Association of Local Government Officers and the National Unionof Teachers but in construction the Union of Construction and Allied trades and Technicians and the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications andPlumbing Union and in transport the Transport and General Workers union and the rail unions - will be bitterly opposed and this will certainly be reflected at the Trades Union Congress in September and increasingly inthe months ahead.    The Party in the House and in the country will simplynot accept the deliberate creation of extra unemployment in the midst ofour worst post-war recession.    There is also a real risk of a breakdown in our relationship with the local authorities.    We promised to bring them into PESC and we are presently seeking their co-operation in cutting some 400 million of excess planned expenditure this year.    To impose neweconomies on them, without consultation will be regarded quite simply as a breach of faith.    But, above all the loss of morale will come from the clearrecognition that we are being forced to take measures not because theyassist our strategy for industrial revival but as a gesture to appease ourcritics at home and overseas.2
8.        We decided last week to cut out the prospective over-spend, so thatwe remain on course with our announced strategy of zero growth in public expenditure^    This by itself will involve the control of local authorityhouse building and a reduction of  150 million on capital expenditure.    Weshould not at this stage do more.    If we cut  1 billion this time, we shallsoon be told that more is needed - and the next  1 billion instalment willrequire even more drastic revisions of our fundamental social policies,and even more deliberate creation of unemployment in construction.9.        Either we maintain confidence by sticking to the course we havealready publicly charted or we go for a comprehensive package which willbe seen to be balanced and relevant to our problems.    Taxes, not public expenditure cuts, are the obvious instrument for short-term demand management.    Of course, higher indirect taxes will add to me RPI,    but before we decide that is a critical objection to their use now, let us ask twosimple questions -Do we see no distinction between prices of essentials such as fares,rents and foods, and more discretionary items such as petrol,tobacco and drink - even if the effect on the RPI is slightly larger?Do union members really prefer fewer jobs to higher prices?10.       But, above all, higher taxes demonstrably bear much more directlyon imports.    If we cut public construction, the direct effect is on jobs athome with only a small reduction on imported materials.    H we put upindirect taxes, this will have a much larger and more direct effect both on imports and on the release of production for the export market.    Taxationeven helps the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement more, since everydomestic job lost means both less revenue from taxes on income and moreexpenditure on unemployment pay to be set against the original public expenditure saving.11.        if tho view of the Cabinet is that  1 billion is not enough, that weshall still be unable to finance our prospective trade deficit, then other anddifferent measures are required.    The situation of deficit, falling reserves and high unemployment precisely fits the terms of Article XH of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and Article 108 of the Rome Treaty andwould justify in international economic law the imposition of generalrestraints on imports.12.       X therefore urge my colleagues to think again and to take the timeneeded to evolve a total package that will bom directly reduce our need forforeign money and command the political support required to maintain the major success that has been achieved in our voluntary prices and incomespolicies.P department of the Environment13 July 19763SECRET
