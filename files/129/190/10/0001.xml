OCCUPATIONAL PENSION schemes the ROLE OF MEMBERSINTHE RUNNING OF SCHEMESCHAPTER IINTRODUCTIONI. The growth of occupational pension schemes is one of the phenomena ofour time. In less than a generation they have almost doubled their coverage.Now they cover half the working population and play u key part in the life ofthis country-socially, financially, economically and in the field of industrial relations. The Government have recognised their value and importance by theunique partnership which the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 establishesbetween the state scheme and occupational pension schemes. But this dealsonly with the area in which the state scheme and occupational schemes interact.Now the Government have decided that there are some changes which shouldbe made in the system of occupational pension schemes as a whole to adaptit better to modern social conditions, so that it serves individual members andthe community to the best advantage.2. The system of occupational pensions has grown piecemeal. On the whole ithas served its members well; but in a number of respects it needs bringing upto date to keep up with our changing society. Workers want to play their part, in accordance with modern ideas of industrial democracy; and they want to be assured that their benefits will be safe in spite of current economicconditions which have been putting a great strain on some schemes. TheGovernment accordingly asked the Occupational Pensions Board to consider to what extent new statutory provision was necessary in relation to solvency,disclosure of information and member participation in occupational pension schemes.3. This request was made in July, 1974. In February, 1975, the Board made afull Report^, having considered both written and oral evidence from a wide variety of sources. The Board came to the conclusion that some furtherstatutory provision was required. The Board&apos;s study of this important andcomplicated subject was invaluable and the Government wish to record their appreciation of the work involved and of the way the task was carried out.4. The Government have now examined the matter exhaustively in the light ofthe Board&apos;s Report. This White Paper sets out the conclusions they have* Report of the Occupational Pensions Board in accordance with Section 66 of the social security Act 1975 on the question of Solvency, Disclosure of Information and MemberParticipation in Occupational Pension Schemes Cmnd 5904 February 1975.
reached and their proposals for action; in some cases alternative proposals are discussed where the evidence does not seem to point clearly to one particularline of action. The three subjects dealt with by the Board are, as the Boardthemselves pointed out, very closely inter-related. The Government take theview that the way into these problems is through proper disclosure of information to members of schemes. This White Paper therefore discusses first the questionof disclosure of information, then the related question of member participation,and finally the question of solvency. It also refers to the question of theconstitution of the Occupational Pensions Board itself and the forthcoming report from the Board about Equal Status for Women in occupational pension Schemes.CHAPTER 2DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION5. Occupational pensions are deferred pay. Occupational pension schemesexist for the benefit of their members. As a matter of justice, and as an aspect of good relations between employers and employees, members of a schemeought to be given all the information necessary to enable them to feel aninvolvement in how it operates and understand how it will affect them personally.This principle seems to be generally accepted. It must now be fully carriedout in practice.6. The members of occupational pension schemes already have legal rights tocertain information:(i) Trust law. Most schemes are set up under deed of trust, and trustlaw as applied to a pension scheme, provides that trustees must givemembers and other beneficiaries, if they request it, the right to inspectdocuments about the state of the trust fund and those which willenable them to ascertain their rights;(ii) under section 19(2)(b) of tie Finance Act 1970 it is a condition of approval of a pension scheme for tax purposes that every employeewho is, or has a right to be, a member of the scheme has been givenwritten particulars of all essential features of the scheme which concernhim (and the Inland Revenue impose a similar requirement when ascheme is notifying major changes);(iii) the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 requires that within a specified period after the beginning of an employee&apos;s employment, the employermust give to the employee a statement which includes details of the pension rights, or state that there is no pension provision, attached tothe employment; and this Act was specifically amended by the social security Pensions Act 1975 to require the statement to say whetheror not the scheme is contracted out.(iv) the Employment Protection Act 1975 places a general duty on employers to disclose information to independent trade unions on request forthe purposes of collective bargaining, provided that it would be inaccordance with industrial relations practice to do so and that theunion would be materially impeded without the information.
7. Apart from these statutory requirements, some progressive employers have themselves taken the initiative in providing employees with clearly presentedinformation about tlieir schemes in considerable detaii. In some cases ongoinginformation is also supplied.8. So there has been progress. But we need to go farther still. Al] employees inschemes should get the kind of information which only the most fortunate nowreceive. There must be systematic arrangements for disclosing the vitalparticulars about the administration and progress of an occupational pension scheme, not only to all its members but in addition to recognised independenttrade unions, who need it to protect their members&apos; interests.Again this is a proposition which would be widely accepted not only by those concerned primarily with the interests of workers, but also by many employersand others concerned with schemes.9. There are two types of information to which scheme members and their trade union representatives should have access. The first is general information about the scheme, the benefits it offers, the method of financing them, and theconstitutional and management structure-the kind of information that can be incorporated in an explanatory booklet issued to all members and prospectivemembers. The second type of informalion has to do with the ongoing financialand actuarial situation of the scheme, the investment of its assets, and thedischarge of the responsibilities of the trustees or management body of thescheme-the kind of information that can be put into an Annual Report.10. In addition there is information which is personal to the member-information about his own benefit position under the scheme. This is bound to incorporate, or reflect, information about him as an individual, liis pay orsalary, his marital and family position, his dependants, and so on. This he mustbe able to get from the scheme on request, within reason. But unlike the other information it raises issues of personal privacy. This means that it is not normallyto be disclosed to other members, or even to his union, without his consent.11. The Occupational Pensions Board considered all three types of information in considerable detail. They took into account the argument put to them that a voluntary code of practice on disclosure of information would in time be observed and would make legislation unnecessary. The Board concluded that a voluntary code could well be ignored by those in most need of encouragement.They recommended that there should be a statutory requirement for disclosure.The Government agree with the BoaitTs view.12. In relation to the first category of information, general information aboutthe scheme, the Board made the following recommendations:(i) prospective members should be given an outline of the scheme&apos;s mainbenefits, eligibility conditions, pension age, and employee contribu-tions, within three months of joining the employment, with subsequentnotification if any of this information is changed before they actuallybecome members;(ii) new members, before or shortly after joining the scheme, should begiven information not only about the constitution of the scheme, but
also about the functions of the trustees and of any managementcommittee or other body charged with the management of the scheme,and in particular ihe methods of appointment and replacement in eachcase (all of which should be specified in the trust deed, scheme rulesor other documentation of the scheme, including public serviceschemes);(iii) new members should also be given details of the scheme&apos;s mainbenefits, the method of financing the scheme, including information about the calculation and collection of employee contributions, thebasis on which the employer contributes, whether or not it is taxapproved, whether it is used for contract! ng-out and a statement ofmembers&apos; rights of inspection of the documents comprising the scheme(any subsequent changes in this information to be notified);(iv) in the case of unfunded schemes a statement should be given to new members on joining, to early leavers with preserved benefits, and to pensioners and other beneficiaries when their benefits first become payable, showing that their benefits are not funded and are thereforedependent either on the company&apos;s continuing prosperity or in thecase of public service schemes on the continued provision of resources from the Exchequer.13. The Government agree with all these recommendations with two modifica-tions. They propose that prospective members should be given information about the basis on which the employer contributes, as well as information aboutemployees&apos; contributions.In the case of unfunded schemes, they do not think that the proposed specialstatement is necessary or appropriate for unfunded public service schemes,since it would not be justifiable to give members of such schemes any cause for anxiety as to the ability of those schemes to meet their commitments.14. On the second category of information, that is information about theongoing financial and actuarial situation of the scheme, the occupational pensions Board made a number of recommendations, according to whether thescheme is fully insured or not. These recommendations are of particular importance because of their bearing on the question of solvency, which isconsidered separately in Chapter 4.15. In the case of insured schemes the Occupational Pensions Board recom-mended that if the benefits were fully secured by insurance policies, without taking into account future bonuses or other forms of profit sharing, the trusteesor managers should be required to prepare a statement each year signed onbehalf of the relevant life office showing:(a) that the benefits were fully secured and(b) whether the premiums required in the previous year had been paidin full-This statement they recommended should be available on request to anyserving member of the scheme.
16. In relation to other schemes (that is self-administered schemes and insuredschemes under which the benefits were not fully secured by insurance policies,because for example the benefit entitlement could not be determined in advance,such as final salary schemes) the Board recommended that the trustees ormanagers should be required:(a) to prepare annual accounts;(b) to have these professionally audited;(c) to obtain an actuarial report at the outset of the scheme and at leastevery three years thereafter;id) to make available on request to members (including pensioners andthose with preserved benefits) and other beneficiaries of the scheme anannual report; this should contain the annual accounts, the auditorscertificate, details of the scheme&apos;s investments, a certificate preparedby the actuary, at the last valuation, showing the extent to whichaccrued benefits would be secured on the immediate discontinuance of the scheme, and a statement by the actuary giving his recom-mendation, at the most recent valuation, on the rate of contributionto be paid, the bases used in making this recommendation, and thelevel of funding which this was intended to achieve; and(e) to present all this information in a form laid down by the Board.17. The Government agree with all these recommendations. In addition theyconsider that the annual report should indicate in general terms the investmentpolicy being followed. They also consider that any member should be able tosee on request any recent actuarial report made in respect of his scheme as it stands, (other than a report concerned with the individual benefit position ofother members, identified in the report).18. In relation to trade unions, the Board recommended that legislation should provide that any information to which members (including pensioners andthose with preserved benefits) or other beneficiaries are entitled, whetherautomatically or on request, could be passed by them to any trade unions orother organisations representing them. The Board also said that they believedthat where unions were recognised for negotiations on pensions matters, thenall the information which they were recommending should be available to members and beneficiaries, save information relating to an individual^ ownbenefit entitlement, should be available to such unions. However they did notconsider that such a requirement would be appropriate for social securitylegislation. The Board also recommended that the Advisory, Conciliation &amp;Arbitration Service should include in the Code of Practice they are drawing upon disclosure of information for collective bargaining, guidance on theinformation that should be given to unions recognised for negotiating on pensions matters.19. The Employment Protection Act 1975 gives unions a direct right to haveinformation for collective bargaining purposes (see paragraph 6(iv) above).For the rest, the view of the Government is that the proposal that members and beneficiaries should be entitled to pass information on to any trade unionsrepresenting them does not go far enough. They consider it essential that
independent recognised trade unions should in all circumstances have directaccess to information in their own right about schemes to which their membersbelong. The legislation the Government will introduce will provide that inde-pendent recognised trade unions with members in a scheme will have the sameright to information either automatically, or on request, as the membersthemselves have (except for information about an individual members benefitposition).20. The third category of informalion is benefit information concerning theposition of the individual member. In relation to this, the Board recommendedas follows:(i) members reaching normal pension age should be given a benefitstatement to be available shortly before or after reaching that agewhich should also include a statement of any rights or options opento them;(ii) pensioners should be notified of any changes within the scheme which affect them;(iii) beneficiaries, or those acting on their behalf, on a members deathshould receive a benefit statement which should also show any rightsor options open to them and undertake to notify them of any subsequent changes within the scheme which affect them;(iv) early leavers should on leaving be given a benefit statement whichshould also include a statement of any rights or options open to themand should state who will be responsible for paying the benefit whenit becomes due, and the procedure for claiming benefit (where appropriate).(v) all scheme members still in the relevant employment (ie activemembers) should be entitled to an individual benefit statementwhenever they reasonably request it.21. The Government agree with all these recommendations. Moreover theyconsider that the notification to pensioners of any changes within the schemewhich affect them should be made in advance.22. Disclosure of information, whether it is general information, or specificallyrelated to the individual^ own beritnl position, will lose much of its value ifthe information disclosed is badly set out. Pension matters are often complex,but the practice of the best schemes shows that the essential matters can be identified and presented in a clear and straightforward manner. The government attach great importance to this factor.23. The requirements set out in this chapter would not involve changes in allschemes equally- Some good schemes may already be disclosing information on this scale, others may be doing very little in this direction. The government consider that compulsory disclosure of information on the scale proposed isessential if workers and unions in all schemes are to be able, as only some ofthem now are, to play a responsible part in the running of pension schemes which so closely affect their interests. Workers will then be able to satisfy themselves that so far as possible adequate arrangements have been made tosafeguard their pension rights.
24. It will not be sufficient to legislate only in respect of new members ofschemes. Existing members must have the same rights to information as new members. However, with about eleven million members in schemes, it will benecessary to allow a reasonable period of time for this to be done. It will alsobe necessary to avoid duplication where the member has already had the specified information. The Government will discuss these points with occupa-tional pensions organisations before the legislation is introduced.CHAPTER 3MEMBER PARTICIPATION IN SCHEME MANAGEMENT25. It is necessary at the outset to distinguish between matters proper to negotiation through collective bargainingand those to be decided by participativemanagement. The Employment Protection Act defines collective bargaining as including the terms and conditions of employment. Occupational pensions can and often do fall within this category and in such cases the introduction of new schemes or the alteration of existing schemes are properly matters for collective bargaining. Scheme administration, however, including such matters asinvestment policy and the discretionary allocation of benefits within agreedguidelines to one individual rather than another, can be the responsibility ofparticipative management. It must be emphasized that the development ofindustrial democracy is complementary to collective bargaining and not intendedto replace or inhibit it in any way. This White Paper does not deal with issues which are properly the subject ot collective bargaining, but with matters whichshould be left for decision within the structure of the scheme itself. The employercouid continue to reserve to himself the determination of his own contributionto the scheme, and the extent of the powers to be exercised by participativemanagement could itself be the subject of collective bargaining.26. There has been valuable experience of participative management of occupational pension schemes. In recent years a number of established as wellas newly formed schemes have had arrangements for employee participationbuilt into them. So there is something to build on. The Governments view isthat the time has come to establish a statutory right to participation. One oftheir first concerns in 1974 was to seek advice from the Occupational PensionsBoard on this matter. The proposals in this White Paper are to be seen also inthe context of the Governments wider commitment to a programme of measuresextending employee participation. Their distinctive feature, not shared by other elements of the programme, is that they deal with the management of resources which comprise the deferred pay of the workers concerned and with schemes setup and administered under trust law as separate institutions solely concernedwith promoting the interests of their members.27. The last survey by the Government Actuary in 1971 showed that therewere about 65,000 occupational pensions schemes in the United Kingdomcovering about 11 million members. The survey did not touch upon the degreeof member involvement in schemes. A fresh survey carried out in the second halfof 1975 is expected to produce some information about this, but the results
will not be available for some months. Nevertheless it can safely be assumed that only a minority of schemes have formal arrangements for participation by employees or unions in scheme management.28. In the light of modem ideas about industrial relations and participativemanagement, it is not acceptable that the structure of most occupational pensions schemes should exclude recognised independent trade unions fromthe administration of the scheme. For this reason, the Government, in framingtheir proposals for the new state pension scheme, considered it essential to puta statutory obligation on the employer to consult the relevant recognisedindependent trade unions before deciding whether or not to put in an applicationto contract out. This has now been carried into effect through regulations madeunder the Social Security Pensions Act 1975*.29. There are many advantages in pension schemes being run jointly by employees and employers. Such a partnership gives members of the schememore confidence in it and a greater sense of security. It can also be expected togive them a better appreciation of the extent of the claims on resourcesconstituted by a pension scheme. When it comes to difficult individual cases,such as exercising discretion to pay death benefit to one person rather than another, member representatives may have special knowledge and be able toadvise more surely than management representatives. The employer, on the otherhand, may have access to specialised financial and investment advice and the trustees will normally rely on the employer to provide the administrative structure for collecting and recording contributions and distributing information.30. The Occupational Pensions Board came to the unanimous decision that member participation in occupational pension schemes is desirable in principle.They referred to the absence of any standardised method of running occupational pension schemes; boards of trustees, management committees, boards of management, corporate trustees, advisory committees and scheme adminis-administrators, all had differing functions and degrees of responsibility in various schemes. They concluded that the variety of practice was such as to makelegislation impracticable. Instead they recommended a Code of Practice to be accompanied by a long term study of its effects and the possibility of laterlegislation. In connection with this Code of Practice, the Board said that theycould see no reason for not following the practice already existing in someschemes of 50:50 representation; and they suggested that, where decisions canbe taVen by a majority vote, there should be a chairman with a casting vote.31. The Government, while recognising that there is a wide variety of schemesdo not accept that legislation would be impracticable. They consider that itwill be possible to find a general formula which would achieve the desiredresult while allowing a variety of structure. The Government have therefore decided to introduce legislation to secure effective member participation.32. It is likely that the Employment Protection Act will increasingly secure thatoccupational pension schemes are brought into the sphere of collective* The Occupational Pension Schemes (Certification of Employments) Regulations 1975.(SI 1975 No 1927).
bargaining. The normal position will then be that schemes, and alterations inschemes, will be negotiated by recognised independent trade unions. In that situation the Government believe that the best way of securing the independence of those who are to be appointed, as a result of the legislation, to achieveeffective member representation in the running of the schemes, is to ensure thatthis is done through trade union machinery, instead of leaving the employer to nominate them or to decide on the arrangements. This would have theadditional advantage of providing a means by which relatively large numbersof union members and officials, taking the country as a whole, would becomefamiliar with the day to day problems of running particular pension schemes.While collective bargaining would no doubt usually be carried on by otherunion members or officials, the indirect results of having this body of up todate experience available for consultation could not fail to be beneficial.33. For these reasons the Govertiment are proposing that participation by employees in the running of occupational pension schemes should be achieved through the agency of recognised independent trade unions, and that they shouldhave a right of appointment to 50 percent of the membership of any controllingbody or bodies specified by the legislation.34. As to the form of statutory requirement to be imposed for this purposethere is room for some difference of view. One possibility would be merely togive recognised independent trade unions the right to appoint 50 per cent ofthe trustees. On this approach the powers of the trustees appointed by theunions would be entirely confined to whatever was laid down in the trust deedabout the powers of trustees generally. There would also be the difficulty ofadapting this possibility to the system of corporate trusteeship. As an alternative,or in addition, it would be possible to provide that every scheme must have acertain kind of controlling body with specified functions, on which there wouldbe equal participation.35. A variation of this would be to select several key functions (such asinvestment, the provision of information to members, and the exercise ofdiscretionary powers in relation to, say, death benefit and hardship cases) andlay down that these must all be exercised by a joint body, that is a body onwhich recognised independent trade unions had a right to 50 per cent of theseats. This would give the maximum freedom of organisation since they couldbe exercised by existing bodies such as trustees or committees of management,or alternatively they could be exercised by ad hoc bodies set up for the purpose.36. A more general approach on similar lines would be simply to lay down that recognised independent trade unions had a right to 50 per cent of theseats on all bodies concerned with the general management of occupational pension schemes, such as bodies of trustees or specialist management committees, or bodies of similar character. This last proposal is the one thatappears to be the most comprehensive while retaining the maximum flexibility,and it is the one which the Government consider most likely to produce a workable arrangement when embodied in legislation. However, the Governmenthave not closed their minds to other possible solutions and intend to have further discussions with the TUC, the CM, the nationalised industries, thepublic services and the pensions interests, before legislating on these points.
37. The Board considered whether there should be express requirements aboutthe representation of women. They concluded that this would need furtherconsideration when the code of good practice which they had recommendedwas being prepared, but pointed out that there would be difficulty in devisingspecific provision for women&apos;s representation. The Governments general policy on eliminating sex discrimination is well known and the measures concerned are on the statute book. The Government wish to see women playing their partin the running of occupational pension schemes. They consider that this can safely be left to the members and the unions to achieve on the footing that menand women would be equally eligible for appointment. It should, however, bepossible for the parties to discriminate in favour of women in this respect ifthey so wish and accordingly the legislation will contain a permissive provision on the lines of Section 49 of the Sex Discrimination Act, 1975.CHAPTER 4SOLVENCY38. When the Government asked the Occupational Pensions Board to examinethe question of the solvency of occupational pension schemes, this was againstthe background of the strains on the system caused by the economic situation as it was then developing. The findings of the Occupational Pensions Boardshow that there is a long history of financial stability in the affairs of occupa-ttonal pension schemes, that faiSures to pay benefits have been very few, andthat this continues to be the case in spite of recent difficulties. Apart from some public sector schemes, the great majority of schemes, and practically allschemes now being set up, are funded in one way or another either through an insurance company, which is subject to the supervision of the Departmentof Trade, or by means of self-administered funds with actuarial and otheradvisers. Thus one way or another the money being set aside by the employer to provide the benefits for employees, and the contributions of the employeesthemselves in contributory schemes, are being supervised at a professionallevel quite independently of the employer.39. It cannot be assumed, however, that because schemes have generally beenable to meet their obligations in the past, no action is necessary to ensurethat they will continue to do so. Most existing schemes are still far from reaching maturity and, in terms of cash flow, are benefiting from a favourableratio of members to pensioners, which has been further helped by the fact thatthe period of growth of schemes has also been a period of expansion of theworking population. There has recently been a rapid extension of final salaryschemes for manual workers, in place of the type of scheme that providespension rights in fixed money terms which can be fully secured throughinsurance policies. And members will increasingly expect their pensions to beinflation-proofed even where this is not a contractual right (and it is likely that schemes will increasingly provide some degree of inflation-proofing on a contractual basis). The Occupational Pensions Board drew attention to anumber of ways in which the financial security of benefits could be strengthenedparticularly in relation to contracted-out schemes.
CONTRACTED-OUT SCHEMES40. Contracting-out is a system whereby, at the instance of their employer,people are allowed to be taken out of the absolute security of the state scheme,in respect of a large slice of the benefits covered by that scheme. To replacethese benefits the employer undertakes to provide equivalent benefits from anoccupational scheme. Therefore in the Governments view it is essential toensure that those benefits which are standing in place of the state schemebenefits will be paid when they fall due. This is the jusWkaiion for the particularand special arrangements for safeguarding the solvency of what are called the&quot;guaranteed minimum pensions&quot; provided by schemes contracted out of thenew state pension scheme set up by the Social Security Pensions Act 1975.41. In relation to contracted-out schemes the Occupational Pensions Boardrecommended that the Board should be given the following powers for thepurposes of ensuring the security of guaranteed minimum pensions:(a) power to require notification that premiums and contributions have,or have not, been paid;lb) power to require actuarial certificates, both at the outset and everythree years, other than for fully insured schemes with power torequire different types of certificate according to the degree of priorityaccorded to guaranteed minimum pensions in the scheme*s winding-uprules;(c) power to require restrictions on investment and in particular controlsof investment in the employing company and associated companies and of concentrations of investment in any one field ;id) power to require any other information from the employer, schemetrustees, managers or life office necessary in the Board&apos;s view toensure the security of the guaranteed minimum pension;(c) power to cancel a contracting-out certificate if they considered thatthe financial or other conditions were not and would not be met; and(/) power to continue to supervise schemes formerly used for contracting-out so long as they retain responsibility for guaranteed minimumpensions.42. All these powers have been given to the Board in the Social SecurityPensions Act, 1975, or the regulations made under it.43. The Board also suggested some additional protection for guaranteedminimum pensions. First, in relation to the Governments proposals which latertook shape as the guarantee scheme in the Policyholders&apos; Protection Act, 1975,they suggested that the normal level of 90% protection for benefits underpolicies should become 100% for guaranteed minimum pensions by analogywith the 100% protection provided for claims under specified types of compulsory insurance policies. The second point concerns Section 65 of theEmployment Protection Act, 1975, which, subject to certain limits, provides inthe case of insolvency for the payment from the Redundancy Fund of contribu-tions outstanding in the 12 months preceding the date of insolvency, including those payable by the employer, whether or not the scheme is contracted out.In relation to this the Board suggested that the cover should extend to all
outstanding contributions required to buy back in full any guaranteed minimumpensions (failing which such contributions should be deemed to be paid). Asthe provisions in the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 and regulations ensurethat in the last resort no employee need lose any guaranteed minimum pensionthrough the non-payment of premiums or contributions by his employer, theGovernment has not pursued these two suggestions.ALL SCHEMES44. The provisions discussed so far deal with the solvency of contracted outschemes in respect of guaranteed minimum pensions. What then should be thestatutory position in respect of people in occupational pension schemes whichare not used as a basis for contracting-out, or in respect of those parts ofcontracted-out schemes which are not within the statutory requirements for contracting-out? Protection for the individual in these cases must come mainlythrough recognised independent trade unions. Pensions are a matter for collective bargaining; and it is for unions to work towards the required degreeof security of the pension schemes they negotiate as part of the process of collective bargaining. On this view the primary task of the Government is to legislate for adequate financial information to be available to workers and theirunions. This the Government will do (see Chapter 2). But funding of finalsalary schemes inevitably involves assumptions which may not be borne out and can never be entirely free of risk. The Government do not believe that, in thelong run, this is a matter solely for collective bargaining. The possibility of some further safeguard must be considered45. The Report of the Occupational Pensions Board discussed in a good dealof detail whether there should be funding and investment controls on all schemes and not only on those used for contracting-out purposes. This is a matter onwhich there is room for more than one view. On the one hand it may be argued that, as pensions are deferred pay, the arrangements for protecting them shouldbe publicly supervised. On the other hand it may be argued that the bestsafeguard is to have all the information made available to workers and theirrepresentatives, and for members to participate in framing and supervising the broad investment policy-both of which the Governments legislation will secure; and that it would represent a very heavy commitment in skilled man-power to supervise the funding of all schemes other than those under whichthe benefits were fully secured by means of insurance policies and the investment of all self-administered schemes and one that would be unnecessary in the greatmajority of schemes. Overseas practice in this matter differs widely. TheGovernment have decided to accept the Occupational Pensions Board&apos;recommendation that there should not be any immediate legislation for fundingand investment controls on schemes which are not contracted out but that thesolvency question should be further studied. They propose that the board should be asked to review the need for any further legislative or other measuresdirected to providing greater security for the pension rights and expectationsof members of occupational pension schemes, having regard to developingconditions and practice affecting both funded and unfunded schemes.
GENERALRegistration of Occupational Pensions Schemes46. In order to facilitate the implementation of the changes they envisaged,the Occupational Pensions Board recommended a statutory system of registration of occupational pension schemes, with the Board being enabled to refuse orwithdraw registration where the documents supplied did not, or ceased to,meet any of the statutory requirements. The Government consider that, while there would be advantages in having a system of registration of schemes, the manpower requirements of such a system, both for central Government andfor private employers and those concerned with the running of occupational pensions schemes, would be out of proportion to the benefits obtained. TheGovernment have therefore concluded that the legislation should simplyimpose the statutory requirements already described, and it would be up tothe member or his union to complain to the employer in the first instance ifthey thought these were not being observed. The central part given to theunions in the proposals in this White Paper would facilitate this approach.The question of enforcement is dealt with more fully in paragraphs 57-58.Statistics47. One of the advantages of a system of registration, had it not been ruled out on manpower grounds, would have been that it would have ensured thatcomprehensive statistics about occupational pensions were readily available.The Government consider that this advantage can be achieved by other means.48. Up to now the statistical surveys of occupational pension schemes madeby the Government Actuary (in 1956, 1963, 1967, 1971 and most recently in1975, still in progress) have been carried out on a voluntary basis. While themajority of the employers who were approached completed some or all of the answers to the questionnaires a task involving some work for them and perhaps for their actuaries and insurance advisers a substantial numberdid not. The Governments proposals for disclosure of information to members and to recognised independent trade unions will mean that all schemes will infuture be preparing summarised information about the scheme on a regular and systematic basis. The managers of the pension schemes and employers are thus much more likely to have information readily available. In these circum-stances, and in view of the great importance of maintaining reliable statistics of occupational pension schemes on an aggregate basis, both for general policyaffecting these schemes and because of the implications for national income andexpenditure statistics, the Government feel justified in talcing statutory powers in relation to statistical surveys. The legislation envisaged in this White paper will therefore include powers under which these statistics could be collected.Information about pension schemes in company accounts49. In addition to their recommendations about disclosure of information to members and beneficiaries of schemes, the Board recommended that theSecretary of State for Trade should be asked to consider whether regulationsmight be made to extend Schedule 2 of the Companies Act 1967 in order torequire the inclusion of specific information about pension schemes in company
accounts or balance sheets. The Board said that the information to be includedwould need further consideration but they suggested the possibility of requiring the inclusion of some or all of the following items:[a) brief financial information about any pension scheme to which the employer contributes;(b) provision for any unfunded pension commitments, where these arcmaterial;(r) where benefits are funded, a statement showing the extent to whichthe schemed assets would, at the last valuation date, have been sufficient to secure accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme&apos;sdiscontinuance; and(d) a statement whether the scheme auditor qualified his last certificate.50. The Governments proposals will ensure that all relevant information is available to members and beneficiaries of schemes, and to recognised independenttrade unions. They will also cover all those persons who are not in a scheme atpresent but can expect to become members in due course. The Government have therefore looked at the Board*s suggestion in the light of its value to other employees who are not in the scheme at all and are not within the category ofprospective members, on the one hand, and the general interest of shareholdersin information of this character, on the other hand. In view of the very largeresources devoted to pension schemes there is a case for saying that it would bein the interests of employees generally, and of shareholders, and indeed in thepublic interest, that company accounts should contain more information ofthis kind than they do at present. However, this raises important considerationsinvolving expert manpower, and further expenditure by companies on profes-sional services, and about the amount of information which can reasonably berequired in company accounts. The Government are considering the Board&apos;recommendation further in the light of these factors.Easier remedy in the Courts51. The Board felt that it should be made easier for all types of members andbeneficiaries, and their representatives, to obtain redress if they believe thescheme is not being run in their best interests, or if they suspect financialmaladministration or that the rules are not being observed. They recommendedthat the Lord Chancellor should be asked to explore the possibility that casesof breach of trust involving pension schemes could be heard in the county courts, instead of as at present being largely confined to the Chancery Divisionof the High Court.52. The Government accept that it should be made easier to institute proceedingsrelating to disputes about entitlement to occupational pensions, whetherconcerning arrears or declarations of right to pension. The Government,therefore, are considering the desirability of relaxing the financial limits on thejurisdiction of the County Courts so as to enable more cases to be brought inthose Courts instead of the High Court.Training of member and employer representatives53. The Board recommended that the Department of Health and social security, in consultation with the various organisations concerned (including
the Training Services Agency of the Manpower Services Commission) should consider existing arrangements for training member and employer representa-tives on the management bodies of schemes, and how these could be expanded to cope with future demand.54. The Government are studying this recommendation and will discuss itfurther with the TUC and CBI.Enforcement55. So far as contracting out is concerned, the requirements mentioned in this white Paper carry their own penalty in that if they are not shown to be complied with the employer will not receive a contracting out certificate, or will lose the certificate issued to him.56. So far as other schemes are concerned, the proposals the Government arebringing forward will ensure that unions have the right to be kept fully informed on all relevant matters relating to occupational pension schemes, and it may beexpected that normally any dispute will be resolved through the machinery of collective bargaining. The legislation will follow the enforcement provisionsestablished for preservation, by providing for members or unions to approach the Occupational Pensions Board if they consider that the requirements arenot being observed. The Board in such a case will under the legislation begiven the power either to direct that the scheme must be appropriately modified,or if they think it necessary, to make the modifications themselves. This alterationof the rules would give the member or union concerned the legal right to havethe particular requirement observed, which they could pursue through themachinery laid down in the scheme or in the last resort, through the Courts.57. The Board recommended that non-submission of information requested bythem or failure to make information available to members after a directionof the Board should be an offence punishable by fines. The Government arestudying this. The Government are also considering the possibility of usingpowers analogous to those in Section 51(7) of the Social Security Act 1973 byempowering the Board in the last resort to cancel the employees power todeduct contributions compulsorily from an employee^ pay if they have declaredhim to be in breach of requirements envisaged in this White Paper.The smaller schemes58. It will probably be necessary to lay down that some of the requirementsproposed in this White Paper do not apply to the smaller schemes. TheGovernment will have discussions with representative organisations on whatthe lower limits affecting the various requirements should be.Public sector schemes59. The application of the principles set out in this White Paper for occupational pension schemes in the private sector must also be considered in relation to public sector schemes. Further study is needed before it can be determined in what ways the proposals in this White Paper should be adapted to meet thespecial circumstances in this area such as the nature of the schemes and therequirements of Ministerial and Parliamentary control. The Government will discuss the adaptations required with those concerned in the nationalised industries, local authorities and the public services.
EQUAL STATUS FOR MEN AND women in OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMES60. &quot;The Government are committed to the principle that women should havea fair deal in occupational pension schemes&quot;. This was the policy laid down inthe White Paper, &quot;Belter Pensions&quot; (para 75) issued in September 1974. it remains Government policy today.61. Action was promptly taken to implement a two part programme forsecuring equality of status for women in occupational pension schemes. Thefirst step was to embody in the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 measuresoutlawing certain discriminatory practices which could operate to the disadvantage of women. These concerned the terms of admission to schemes inrelation to the age and length of service needed for becoming a member andwhether membership was voluntary or obligatory. The regulations&apos; made underthese provisions will come into operation with the new pension arrangements ofthe 1975 Act in April 1978. The major task was, however, to remedy the absenceof any comprehensive information about occupational pensions provision forwomen and to consider what remained to be done to achieve the broadobjective of equality.62. In February 1975 the Secretary of State for Social Services referred thewhole question of equality of status for men and women in occupational pension schemes to the Occupational Pensions Board for advice in the following terms:&quot;To consider in the light of the Governments proposals for the futureof pensions and in particular their invitation to end discrimination against women in occupational pension schemes, what further steps are necessary, whether by way of legislation or otherwise, to implement the principle of equality of status for men and women in such schemes,and to report&quot;.The extent of the range of considerations of which account needs to be takenwas demonstrated in the comprehensive memorandum issued in April 1975 bythe Occupational Pensions Board for the guidance of those who might wishto submit evidence to them relating to existing practice and suggestions forchange. The issues referred to included conditions for entry, provision fordependants, rules relating to pension age, and the levels of benefits and contributions.63. It is understood that the report of the Occupational Pensions Board onequality of status for men and women in occupational pensions schemes will beready soon. It is the Governments hope that it will be possible to extend the consultations and discussions of the proposals in this White Paper to coverproposals arising from consideration of the Board&apos;s report.* The Occupational Pension Schemes (Equal Access to Membership) Regulations J976(SI 1976 No. 142).
CONSTITUTION OF OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS BOARD64. The Occupational Pensions Board said that for ease of reference they had referred throughout their Report to the Board as the central authority whichthey were recommending should discharge a number of new responsibilities inrelation to occupational pension schemes. They were, however, reluctant to volunteer an opinion whether the Board, cither as at present constituted or with some changes, should function as this central authority. Their references to the Board in their Report were therefore without prejudice to any ministerial decisions on this question.65. The Occupational Pensions Board, since being set up in 1973, have provedtheir value in the field both of administration and of advising Governments on questions referred to them. To substitute for the Board at this point a newcentral authority would, in the Governments view, lead to unnecessarydisruption and discontinuity of experience. The Government have thereforeconcluded that the responsibilities for central supervision which they will beproposing in their new legislation should be placed on the occupational pensions Board and not on some different authority. In the light of this decisionit is plain that the constitution of the Board should be reviewed to see how itneeds to be adapted to its new responsibilities.66. Under the Social Security Act 1973, the Board consists of a Chairman, a deputy Chairman and not less than eight nor more than 12 other members allappointed by the Secretary of State; in fact the Board had ten other membersuntj] September 1974 and has had the full complement of 12 other memberssince then. Of these other members, one has to be appointed after consultationwith organisations representative of employers, and one has to be appointedafter consultation with organisations representative of employed earners.67. The functions of the Board are set out in the 1973 Act, and in the social security Pensions Act, 1975, taken together. Their central role is to supervise the way in which occupational pension schemes are carrying out the statutory requirements laid on them in relation to preserved benefits for early leavers,and in due course to receive and decide applications for contracting out underthe new state pension scheme, including the supervision of contracted-outschemes, and the supervision of the statutory requirements for the equal accessof women to occupational pension schemes. In addition the Board have an executive role in altering schemes, either as part of the enforcement of thestatutory requirements or to achieve modifications in schemes which would otherwise be impossible or very difficult for the schemes to achieve themselves.The Board also have such advisory functions as may be conferred on themby the Secretary of State in respect of occupational pension schemes, and a specific advisory function in respect of regulations proposed to be made by theSecretary of State under the statutory provisions relating to occupational pensions, which must be referred to them in advance.6H. In view of the Board&quot;s powers both to supervise and to assist occupational pension schemes, it is important that both the constitution and membership of
the Board should reflect the fact that these schemes are disposing of the deferredpay of their members. At the same time the constitution and membership ofthe Board should also reflect the fact that employers have set up the schemes,invariably contribute to them, and often have major commitments under such schemes. The Government will therefore be consulting those concerned as toany changes desirable in the present constitution of the Occupational PensionsBoard to reflect these considerations, in the light of the new responsibilities which their legislation will place on the Board.CONCLUSION69. The changes proposed in this White Paper will give members of occupational pension schemes the right to know the essential facts about their schemes andto take part in running them. They must be introduced as soon as possible.But the timetable must be realistic.70. In the period up to April 1978 those concerned with occupational pension schemes will be busy adjusting to the new state pension scheme, either throughcontracting-out or through changes which may be necessary if they decide not to contract-out The Government consider that this must be a priority task in whichscheme members, through their trade unions, should be actively involved.While therefore the Government would hope that the implementation of thenew requirements would start straightaway, these would not become compulsoryin any event before April 1978 and the Government would undertake to giveat least two years&apos; notice before they did become compulsory. This should enableschemes either to make all the changes together, or to phase them in over a period.71. The first step will be for the Government to discuss the proposals in this white Paper with representative organisations, including the TUC, the CBI andthose concerned with occupational pension schemes. After taking account of views and comments, the Government will present the new legislation as early as possible.Printed m Englmd tor Her Mijettr&apos;i Suiiomy Office b?
