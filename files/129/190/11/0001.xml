STRATEGY AND PRIORITIESA Memorandum by the Central Policy Review StaffINTRODUCTION1. In October 1974, just after the last election, a memorandum bythe Central Policy Review Staff on Strategy and Priorities was circulatedto the Cabinet (C(7 4)110),    It attempted to review the tasks facing thenew Government in the short and long run.  Since then some 20 eventfulmonths have passed and a new administration has been formed.   the basic long run objectives remain unaltered (control inflation, improveeconomic growth, reduce unemployment, correct the balance of payments,bring about a fairer and more humane, more actively democratic Britain),and indeed, the memorandum stands re-reading to see how many of the short term problems remain with us.  But now, in the early days of anew administration, it la worth reviewing the outlook.Inflation2.        All in all, the past 20 months have gone better, but only a little better, than we then feared.   The first stage of the social contract (nowages policy) was a disaster.  By the spring of 1975 the Governmentsheavy social expenditure (pensions, housing) was being rewarded by theminers requiring wage settlements of 35 per cent.   The economy wasnose-diving towards hyper-inflation, with all that would mean for the collapse of our social fabric and institutions.   For a few months theoutlook was bleak indeed.   Then came the quite remarkable transformation-mation - the  6 pay agreement, the new social contract with its voluntarywages policy.   An agreement which has been held to despite the severepressures of continued rising prices and sharp reductions in traditionaldifferentials. It has been held, too, with very few labour disputes andstoppages.  Now we have the  2. 50- 4 policy and if that equally holdsdespite the same pressures (and the slide in sterling will exacerbatethe pressure from rising prices) then Britain will have achieved virtuallyI
an economic miracle.   That ia to say, a deceleration of wage/priceinflation at a quite incredible speed and an ability to call forth adisciplined yet voluntary response from its fragmented Trades union movement which is quite out of tune with previous history and experience.3.        This appears indeed as a &quot;new economic order&quot;, born largelyout of fear.  The British workers really had become, for the first timein their history, frightened by the prospect of hyper-inflation.   their leaders knew it and have responded accordingly.  But will it last?  Whenthe inflation rate has slowed down (and the fear becomes less immediate)will the old order return - with its free collective bargaining; with eachunion out to &apos;re store differentials1 and to show that it can do ratherbetter in its settlement than Us rivals?  The continuance of the *fceweconomic order&quot;, the social contract in its new form with an effectiveincomes policy at its heart, clearly is the major problem facing Ministers,4.        On one possible outcome the Government will have a record toshow of a terrible first year on the inflation front, then a brilliantrecovery and the foundation of a new effective, on-going policy of collaboration between Government, TUC (and CBI?); with the prospectof Britain&apos;a inflation rate being kept in line with other industrial countries and with a new spirit of collaboration to improve productivity, to raisethe level and effectiveness of investment and training.   On anotheroutlook, th$  6 and  2.50- 4 policies will appear as a short burstof sanity, with the old Adam breaking out again as soon as the inflationproblem looked temporarily less worrying.5. The Central Policy Review Staff has previously presentedmemoranda on longer term incomes policies (including policies for higher Incomes).    Ministers know that in our view continuance of incomes policy is a central, essential element of policy but the diffi-culties in achieving It are formidable indeed.   The institutional pressuresto restore *free collective bargaining1 are great; differentials will have2
been even more squeezed than now;  there is little the Government can offer on the public expenditure side;  and workers have been conditionedto the view that inflation will be cured &quot;permanently1 by the presenttemporary period of Sacrifice&apos;,  i.e. two rounds of incomes policy.Time will be short between the achievement of the  2, 50-f 4 agreement and the next round and a great deal of public education will be requiredto obtain the continuance.The Balance of payments6. Aa on the inflation front, the experience of the past 20 monthson the balance of payments has been quite a good deal better than wefeared.   The oil price rises had created great uncertainty about theworld economy.  Would the slump be made incomparably deeper and go on for an unprecedented length of time (indeed, would it, the world economy, ever fully recover)?   Would the world&apos;s money markets takethe strain of the incredible OPEC surpluses?  Would Britain be able to borrow abroad the huge amounts implied by her prospective deficits??.        It has all gone better than that.  The world&apos;s financial systemcoped remarkably well with the OPEC balances, and the OPEC countriesincreased their imports much faster than we had imagined possible.The world slump was indeed of a depth not seen for nearly half a centurythough that was as much due to the extraordinary boom of 1971-73 as toOPEC rapacity.    But the recovery was not a delayed one.   The world economy turned the peak of the boom in the late summer of 1973.  It wasonly two years later that the upturn began - led by the most powerfuleconomy of them all, the United States, and led by the most powerfulengine of recovery, the motor industry.  Over the past six months,country after country has revised upwards its prospects for recovery.There still is the widespread feeling that the climb back may be slower than in the past and that previous employment levels may not be realised in the coming boom, but even that pessimism may in the event be provedwrong.3
8.        As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, we went into thisslump a little later than others (countries are never completely syn-chronous) and we are climbing out a little later.  How fast and how farwe will climb out is uncertain.   The Treasury forecast is a recovery in output of the order of 4 per cent per annum and for a slow fall in unemploy-ment.  These forecasts could be proved pessimistic if the British consumergoes rapidly back to his old ratios of consumption and saving and if the newlevel of sterling proves highly stimulating to export volumes and to importsubstitution (including taking holidays at home rather than abroad).9.        The British balance of payments (together with other industrial countries) improved much faster than we had expected.    (In part thiswas due to the very depth of the slump reducing imports.)   Indeed,there was a great need for improvement, fox Britain normally has a reasonably strong balance of payments In a slump when imports are lowin volume and low in price (the reverse happens in a boom).    For us tohave a heavily adverse balance in a slump was very worrying, and stillis.  But there has been solid progress.  Export volumes are respondingbetter than at any time in our recent history and the new level of sterlingshould help to maintain that performance.10.       It is encouraging too, that the unprecedented slump has not caused a widespread return to protectionism in the world.   Heavy unemployment has brought many Governments under pressure but no doubt they, likeus, have convinced themselves that temporary protection to mitigate theemployment effects of the slump would not pay.   Slump apart, there is aview that in the case of the United Kingdom, our medium term employment and productivity prospects could be greatly improved by a 5 year period ofbroadly baoed control on imported manufactures.  But the truth is thatthere is no easy option down this road either.  We would not receive theagreement of our e.c. or OECO partners to such a 5 year period of wide-spread protection, so the effect on our foreign relationships would beprofound.  Also we could not be sure that British Industry would be4
confident that the 5 year period could be relied upon (Governments maychange), nor that they would in such a period effect a radical transformation-mation.   Protection may be relaxing rather than stimulating.11.        The previous CPRS memorandum on Strategy was much concernedwith the total likely overseas borrowing requirement of the United Kingdom1975-80.   The events of the last few months have emphasised again (if that were necessary) the difficulties which we must expect to face, even withthe prospects of North Sea oil and gas, in financing our continuing verylarge deficits on the balance of payments.  Moreover, the level of ourexchange rate is an ever present concern - as it is to every trading nationin the world (those with strong currencies continually fear that they may bebecoming uncompetitive).   The recent slide in sterling may have been &quot;over-done&quot; in the sense that it has (temporarily) more than restored our recentloss of competitiveness.  But some slide was essential to our strategy andin a world of floating exchange rates, with large numbers of traders taking a view about when it would best pay them to settle their accountb (leads andlags) one cannot dictate precisely where the rate will settle.12.       There are obvious dangers in continuing to use reserves and borrowingto &quot;protect the rate&quot;.   Nothing is easier than to put all one&apos;s resources intothe market trying to prove to traders that their expectations are wrong, and difficult decisions will continue to face us on when to support sterling and how much of our reserves to commit.  So far, the bearish actions againststerling have been very largely traders leads and lags, but if one or more of the three major official holders of sterling (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Nigeria)joined the sellers, the slide could become very fast indeed.   We would takewhat defensive measures we could (interest rate policy, money supply con-straints, temporary import restraints) but some further concerted inter-national action would probably be necessary to help stabilise the rate.  Itis very likely that the price for that help would be Government agreement to tackle what foreign opinion sees as a major cause of our troubles - the size of our PSBR - or put more precisely, the level of our public expend!-ture.  Indeed, the prospects are that any lenders (the IMF, the Group of 5,the market) will expect us to reduce the PSBR and public expenditure asa condition of their loans.5
Public Expenditure13.       The Labour Government was elected on a programme of heavypublic expenditure and this programme they proceeded to implement intheir early months of office (particularly in housing and social security).There is no doubt, though, that the Party wants still more.   The recentsocial contract declaration by the TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committeeis studded with heavy expenditure items.    Most of them are very appealingand apparently necessary.  Yet today&apos;s public expenditure is tomorrow&apos;staxation and there is little doubt also that voters, central and local, atall levels of income, are feeling even the present level of taxationoppressive.14.       But there is more taxation to come to pay for even the present level of public expenditure.   Today&apos;s  I2bn. PSBR may be acceptablein a slump but if our balance of payments and investment objectives areto have a hope of being met we will need to reduce (perhaps halve) thePSBR two years from now.  If in the face of this necessity public expenditure is allowed to increase, the taxation prospects towardsthe end of this Governments term of office are grim.  Beyond that,in the early 1980s, even North Sea oil will not make a dramatic difference to public expenditure prospects - and the difference it does make shouldbe to investment rather than to consumption if the benefits from theNorth Sea are to be properly utilised to improve our economicperformance,15.       The position then on public expenditure is straightforward -but harsh.  Ministers made a determined effort last year and trimmedover  3bn. off prospective public expenditure four years hence, 1978/79.The result was that the continuously rising public expenditure of recentyears was to give way to a &apos;no growth&apos; situation.  It was a change ofpace almost so dramatic as the change of pace on wage settlements, andit has brought similar strains.   But nothing less will do.  Indeed, even this may not be enough,6
16.       Ministers realise this in principle but it is almost intolerablyhard to make it stick in practice.   The deceleration has been so fast thatthe likely over-run on open-ended programmes (local authorities andpublic housing) already threatens to exceed the contingency allowance.And the claims continuously arrive for industrial assistance to cushionthe slump, to help industrial reconstruction, for new investment, fornewly nationalised industries.  It is virtually certain that unpleasantsteps will have to be taken to control the present open-ended programmes(e.g. housing), it is quite likely that Bocial programmes may have to befurther cut (either because of external pressures or to make more room for industrial programmes which Ministers decided in PESC must havetop priority) and the savings decided upon in Civil Service manpower have yet to be translated into reductions in public Bervices.  Again there ishere a major task of public education in the realities of the taxation/expenditure &apos;link&apos; and the need to adjust expectations, especially of social pressure groups.   Yet this position must be accepted (andimplemented).Industrial Strategy17.       The PESC cuts have &quot;made room&quot; for industrial expansion andthe present medium term strategy, as set out in the last Public Expendi-ture White Paper, requires an 8^ per cent annual rate of growth in manufacturing output for the next three years if the employment, balanceof payments and real disposable income targets are to be met.   This rateof growth is without precedent.  It has never before been sustained over three years.   That is not to say such a rate of growth cannot be achieved,but if it 1b to be achieved major changes will have to take place very rapidly, both within the manufacturing sector and in the environmentwithin which manufacturing industry operates.7
18.       A revival in Investment in manufacturing industry is proving veryslow to materialise.  Confidence is still very low.   The battle against inflation is seen by many potential investors as being still in the balance.The return on investment is at historically very low levels (in manycompanies on an &quot;inflation accounting basis&quot; it is still negative) and the continuation of price and/or profit controls is seen as being likely to restrict company earnings in the upturn.   The level of personal taxationdiscourages risk-taking by small businesses and the self-employed.Home demand is recovering slowly and the main increase in sales willhave to come from exports and import substitution.  Even with therecent sharp fall in the exchange rate, the productivity of British manu-facturers will have to be greatly increased if they are to obtain a largersteadier slice of the home and world markets.  Since the level of invest-ment is low, this increase in productivity will have to come in the firstinstance from better utilisation of existing plant.   There is a good dealof evidence to show that there is plenty of scope for such increases.The CPRS study of the motor industry and the recent study of west midlands engineering firms show   that there Is scope for increasing productivity by SO per cent or more in many cases.   Studies of machine tool manufacturers, the hosiery and knitwear industry and even of the chemical industry have shown that there is major scope for raisingproductivity.  Many parts of nationalised industry (and indeed many parts of local and central government) also have scope for majorproductivity improvements.19.       The vital need in Britain&apos;s present economic situation greatly to increase productivity (and to redeploy the manpower thus released)will have to be a main theme of the Governments industrial strategy.The NEDO industry studies should come up with some firm proposals,but probably the quickest and surest improvements in productivity will come from improving communications within firms, from a much greatertwo-way flow of information between management and the shop floor8
generating a much greater sense of common purpose than exists atpresent.   &quot;Industrial democracy&quot; in the formal sense obviously has apart to play in all this, though just how it Is best organised and how much is to be expected from it in the early years is a matter for debate.However, the example for providing a greater flow of information willin the first place have to come from the Government, setting out thereal nature of the problems facing British industry at present.   Theyrmi3t also try to convince industry that the planning agreements element in their strategy has an important operational significance.  At presentopinion varies from regarding them as a threat to regarding them as ajoke (an empty slogan).   There is, so far, little on the industrial strategyfront to compare with the achievements in incomes policy or in containingpublic expenditure.   This must change.  It has, though, always to beremembered that we have had great difficulty in the past in making rapidchanges in industrial productivity and that the power of Government inthis field is particularly limited.Energy Strategy20.      Energy strategy is one element in industrial strategy but a particularly vital element for Britain, given North Sea oil and gas, thehuge investments in electricity generation, the importance of the NUM.Yet we still lack a coherent, co-ordinated energy strategy.    In theperiod ahead we need to produce as clear a view as we can on the prospective world price of energy towards the end of this century, and decide what this implies for our investment and pricing strategy on coal, oil, gas, electricity, and for energy conservation.   We need to fit our current decisions in the energy field into such a strategy andnot move ad hoc in relation to the immediate position vis-a-vis the num,the problems of the turbo-generator industry, public fears on nuclearsafety, etc.9
Nationalised Industries21.       Britain has an extremely large nationalised sector.   improvements in productivity there are just as vital as in the private sector.  In transport and the postal services we seem to be in a downward spiral of high wagecosts, higher prices, lower demand, lower services.   Morale in mostof the nationalised industries is at its lowest ebb for many many years,and relations between the nationalised industries and Government haveseldom been worse.  Indeed, the nationalised industries have been boththe pace-setters for wage inflation and a prime example of uncertainmanagement.   The large NEDO study which the Government commissioned(and in which the CPRS has participated) should soon be completed.  Onthe publication of that report, the Government should lose no time making up its mind what should be done.Social Policy22.       Ministers have agreed that future rates of growth in socialexpenditure must be very much lower than they have been in the last ten years.  Difficult decisions about priorities will continue to be needed.There are many deserving groups: the elderly, the disabled and handi-capped, poor families.   In the social security field, in particular, thereis the problem of the balance between providing adequate universalbenefits for groups such as pensioners or families with children, and providing selective benefits for those in special need,23.       The aim must be to concentrate resources on services andproblem areas which Ministers think most important.   Other servicesand problem areas will thus have to get less.  Ministers will want tobe sure that their decisions can be justified in the face of criticism from their own supporters, the professionals (teachers, doctors, etc),pressure groups and others.  A coherent social programme which canstand up to criticism cannot be developed by the individual social10
departments and Ministers on their own.    Priorities, and at least some major problems, need to be tackled across departmentalboundaries.   This is the basis for the report &quot;A Joint framework for Social Policies&quot; presented to Ministers and published last year.Education24.      There are awkward corners for the Government to turn inalmost all areas of social policy (pensions, cash benefits, the NHS,race relations) but one area where positive action is needed in theperiod ahead is education.  In many fields (the three &apos;Rs&apos;, thecurriculum in comprehensives, education for employment, etc) publicunease comes up against the traditional British view that education should be left to the teaching profession and Governments should not interfere.  It is not the view held in all countries and it may well benecessary to question it in Britain,Housing25.      Housing, like education, is an important area of social policywhere old and long held convictions will need to be re-examined.  in aggregate terms the housing situation is improving all the time: the ratio of dwellings to households is higher than ever before: theproportion of households without amenities is falling.  And yet many people have serious housing problems;  homelessness, slum conditions,overcrowding, etc;   these problems are particularly acute in London,Government subsidisation of housing is higher than ever before.  and yet many people cannot afford mortgage repayments on even a smallhouse,26,       These paradoxes are only some of the consequences of a complex,irrational, distorted (and huge) system of housing finance.   This system is under review at the moment.   Whatever the specific proposals thatemerge from the Housing Finance Review, Ministers will have two11
broad options.  They will have to choose between on the one hand, aroot and branch reform of the whole system and, on the other, marginaladjustments to temper the worst distortions and inequities that result from existing arrangements.  Neither course will be popular, sinceboth will Involve rents rising at least as rapidly as money incomes,and probably adverse changes in the tax position of owner-occupiers.But the radical reform (which would of course have to be implementedgradually over a period of years) would carry the promise that, after it had been fully introduced, housing would no longer be the intractableproblem that it is today.Devolution27.       The handling of devolution is crucial both strategically and politically.  It is the most important constitutional issue to face any government in the last 50 years and the future unity of the United kingdom is at stake.   The top priority is obviously Scotland and recent decisions by Ministers have set the course for pressing on firmly with a sensiblepackage which moderate Scotsmen can support and which will isolatethe separatists.  Unfortunately, the moderates&apos; appetite may well growwith feeding, but further concessions could threaten the United Kingdom&apos;economic and political unity, and encourage an English backlash(especially from Northern England).28.       The position of England is still entirely open - and it is, after all, four-fifths of the UK population.   The remarkable thing is the verysmall interest in England so far in the whole subject of devolution.    Butthe interest must come some time.  When it does, it is virtually certain to focus partly on the level of Scots and Welsh representation at West-minster and on the part played by Scots and Welsh MPs in the deter-mination of English affairs, partly on the fears that the Scots (and welsh) will get a bigger share of the UK cake, and partly on the argument that if regional government is good for the Scots it is good12
for the English too.  Any major changes for England would almost certainly involve further re-organisation of local authorities (and the health service) and the passing down of more powers from secretaries of State to local governments.  If Ministers do not want to face such changes for the foreseeable future, it will be important when the Englishdebate does warm up not to encourage any excessive expectations.29.       The recently published Layfield Report is in fact mainly aboutthe distribution of power between central and local government and thatmay trigger off the devolution debate in England,  But whether it doesor not, the Government will have to address its mind very rapidly tothat part of the Layfield Report which suggests a Local Income Tax,For the debates on devolution to Scotland are bound to raise the questionof the taxation powers of the new Assembly.   The feasibility of a LocalIncome Tax hinges crucially on the radical simplification of PA YE.So the Government will have to decide quite quickly on whether to accept and work towards important simplification in our direct tax structure(mainly in the field of personal allowances).Britain and the External World30.      We must continue to give priority to our relations with thosemajor industrialised countries (the United States, the larger eec countries, Japan) on whose co-operation we may well depend for thesuccess of our macro-economic policies.  Also of great importance tous are the major official holders of sterling (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Nigeria),    Another area to which Ministers attach priority is relationswith the Third World.31.       There are  iva principal issues which could have an adverse effect on our relations with one or other of these groups of countriesin the next few years:13
(a) e.c. policy:   the expectations with which we were welcomedinto the e.c. by most of our partners have largely been disappointed.We are perceived as having little stomach for &quot;building Europe&quot;and as trying to minimise the impact of the Community on the life of this country.  This partly reflects the fact that there is much less commitment to Europe in this country than in the Eight,with the possible exception of Denmark,  But it also reflects thefact that Ministers have not yet taken a view on what the Long-term goal of the Community&apos;s development should be or whatkind of Community would best suit British interests.  The CPRSbelieves that Ministers should have a long term strategy towardsthe e.c..  It also believes, more immediately, mat ministers should bear in mind the effect their e.c. policies may have onthe general attitudes towards this country of our major partners in the e.c., whose help we may well need.(b) Defence:   pressure on public expenditure is bound to leadto suggestions for another look at the defence budget.   The cutsresulting from the 1974/75 Review were unwelcome to our allies,especially the United States.   Further cuts could do grave damage to our relations with them.(c) Middle East:   there is quite likely to be another roundbetween Israel and the Arabs during this Parliament.   On pastform this could seriously strain our relations not only with theArab oil producers and holders of sterling but also with theUnited States and our partners in the e.c..   There is very littlethat we can do to protect ourselves against this danger but It isof great importance that contingency planning should be kept upto date.(d) Southern Africa:   Southern Africa Is also of direct concern to the United Kingdom.  We are already doing what we can topromote as peaceful as possible a transition to majority rule14
in Rhodesia and making contingency plans for refugees.   this work will have to continue.  For the longer term we need to plan for a similar transition in South Africa, both by pressure on theSouth African Government to proceed with its liberalisationmeasures and supporting them as they occur, and by contingency planning against the effect on our economic interests in SouthAfrica of civil war or take-over by black governments hostile to the United Kingdom.(e)   Nprth^south relations:  during the last 20 months, thecountries of the Third World have strengthened their demands for a New International Economic Order.    Contrary to earlierexpectations, cohesion has been maintained between the poorercountries and the oil producers.   This presents particular problems for the United Kingdom.   We believe, more than manyof our partners, that it is both right and in our own long-terminterest to ease the lot of the LDCs; and expectations havebeen aroused by our initiative on commodities last year.  Buteconomically we are worse placed than most to face the costs of redressing the balance between the rich and the poor in theworld.   This dilemma puts great pressure on Ministers both athome and abroad.    The position we had to take at UNCTAD IV,and the poor public position we presented there, shows that itis important not to promise more than we can deliver and thatour interests lie in avoiding the limelight and adopting aninconspicuous position amongst the moderates on North/Southissues.CONCLUSIONS32. Predictably enough, the longer term priorities and problemshave changed relatively little from those set out by the CPRS twentymonths ago in C(74)110.    The Government has had quite remarkable15
success, in the short term at least, in instituting a &apos;^iew economicorder&quot;, a collaboration with the TUC on major issues of economic and social policy in exchange for a voluntary wages policy.  But that new form of the social contract is still in its fragile infancy - and is seen to be so by foreign opinion as well as domestic.   The prime task forGovernment must be to establish it on firmer and firmer foundations,including the CBI, as well as the TUC, and extending it in a practicalform into industrial policy as well as prices, profits and incomes policy(and extending it from NEDO at the top down to companies, to the shopfloor and covering private industry, national industry and central andlocal government services).33.       The dialogue on the social contract must have an increasinglyrealistic attitude to public expenditure and the relationships between public expenditure and taxation.   The dialogue on reducing unemploy-ment must have an adequate realisation of the need for industrialflexibility and geographical movement;  of the possibilities of retrainingand not concentrate on the preservation of existing jobs.  Success insome degree is necessary on all these fronts if we are to succeed interms of inflation, productivity, the balance of payments, the level of sterling, indeed, our standing and influence in the world.34.       The most important set of tasks facing Ministers is thepursuance of these sets of dialogues, these areas of public education and persuasion.   These areas apart, most of the other problems facing the Labour Government when it was elected seem no less intractableand pressing,  Devolution, regional and local government organisation is coming closer to the crunch.   Education presents more basicproblems than seemed apparent two years ago.  Housing likewisedemands a fundamental re-examination.   The nationalised industries are in severe disarray.  An energy strategy needs to be evolved and16
implemented,  very day the level of total public expenditure threatensto exceed the programmed level and painful decisions have continuouslyto be taken to keep it in check, as kept in check it must be.35.       Externally we still have to decide our longer term objectives in the Common Market and to fit our short term operations Into thatpattern.  We have the difficulties of reconciling our public commitment to increase our help to the poorest countries with the strain that suchhelp would put on our weak economy.  We have, above all, the need to convince the world that we are not in the same state as Italy, that wehave seen where we are drifting and have fundamentally changed course.Otherwise our currency could slide sharply and we would no longer be our own master.  There is indeed a great deal to do.23 June 197617
