the attack on inflationthe second year1. Britain needs a strong economy and a fair society. Achieving this isa task for the whole of our people, not just for the Government. It willrequire a sustained effort. But in the first year of the attack on inflation wehave made a good start.2. The damage done by rapid inflation is both human and economic.It eats into the living standards of those least able to protect themselves.The housewife, the pensioner and the saver suffer first The struggles ofmore powerful individuals or groups to escape Its ill effects only pot moreburden onto others. The inflation weakens mutual bust in our society and confidence in our institutions. Economic confidence too is threatened. Jobsare destroyed because industries cease to be profitable and their investmentstops. People lose confidence in our economy. These are the dangers whichfaced us last year. Since July we have begun to pull away from them.3. Our first objective now must be to we that the British economy paysits way in the world. This means getting rid of the balance of paymentsdeficit; making British products competitive in world markets, and seeing that the resources our industry needs for exports and investment are therewhen they are needed. The world economic recovery gives us the bestopportunity we have had as a trading nation for many years. Now wehave to seize it.4. Our second objective must be to rebuild British industry, especiallyour manufacturing industry. We have to make it more efficient, more prc-ductive, better able to innovate and to respond to new opportunities. that means putting more into new productive investment. In order to create theconditions for future improvements in living standards and public services,that investment has to take priority over any increase in other pnbac or private spending for the next few years.5. The third objective is to reduce unemployment and to maintain oursocial priorities. We can do this only by succeeding in the first two objectives and re-establishing our economy and our industry in tbe world. But as we make progress in putting the economy right, we must take every step wecan to reduce the damage and waste that results from a high level of un-employmem and, within the limits of our resources, we must protect themembers of our society most in need.6. The attack on inflation is fundamental to every part of this national enterprise. If we fail to control inflation we put every one of these objectivesat risk. Thanks to the efforts of both sidas of industry and of the wholeBritish people, the first year of tbe attack on inflation is succeeding. Thenext section of this White Paper describes the progress we have made sofar. This progress has been possible because the British people, includingthe millions of members of the trade union movement, have recognised the basic facts confronting the nation. Tbe undeiat&amp;commanding which tbe british people have shown of the dangers we all face is the Governments greateststrength in tackling our difficulties. The Government will continue to take
the trade unions, industry and the public fully into their confidence. Aspart of the Social Contract the trade union movement has been more closely associated with economic management than ever before. Among the fruitsof this have been the success of the first year of our attack on inflation, adramatic improvement in industrial relations and the beginning of a newspirit of cooperation in British industry.PROGRESS SINCE JULY 19757. Out inflation rate has been more than halved since last July. This. is.the measure of the achievement of the British people since the White Paper,&quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; was published. And it has set Britain on theroad to recovery.8. In the first half of 1975 inflation was running at an annual rate ofabout IS per cent. In the last 9 months the position has been transformed.The inflation rate in the first 6 months of 1976 is likely to be well underhalf what it was in the same period last year. By May 1976 the year-on-year inflation rate had fallen below 15  per cent. In his Budget Speech on6 April the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in order to end next year with an inflation rate at least in line with oat foreign competitors we mustaim at a further halving of our inflation rate by Da.ember 1977. further progress in reducing inflation is the key to all our policies.9. The achievements so far would not have been possible without the voluntary  6 pay policy put forward by the TUC last July and endorsed bythe Government, Since I August 1975, this policy has been fully observedthroughout the economy. It has greatly reduced not only the rate of price and cost increases, but also the inflationary expectations of a year ago.Although there is still a long way to go, it has put the country in a very strong position to benefit from the recovery of world trade, with exportsas the main stimulus to renewed growth in output. All the signs are that exports are growing much faster than the 10 per cent annual rate whichthe Government expected at the tune of the Budget.10. The Government have used all the weapons available to them toreduce inflation- The growth of the money supply has been strictlycontrolled, and cash limits have been introduced across a wide range ofpublic sector expenditure. These measures were foreshadowed in last year*white Paper. Together with continuing controls on prices and dividends,they have complemented and buttressed the  6 pay policy.tackling uaemptoymentU, The trend of unemployment in 1975 pointed to disaster. The  6policy played a large part in checking it. For their part, the Government haveacted throughout the period since the 1975 Budget to alleviate unemploy-ment by new measures on jobs and training. In that time they have madeavailable over  400m in order to create or keep open 250,000 jobs or training places. Government measures have included a temporary employ-meat subsidy, a recruitment subsidy for school-leavers, a job creationprogramme, an acceleration in the already fast-expanding programme for
adult retraining and placement, increased allowances for training andemployment transfer and special allocations to industry to maintainapprentice-training during the recession. The main emphasis in the wholeprogramme has been on helping young people and particularly school-leavers.In addition to these programmes, Government assistance to industry underthe Industry Acts and other measures, or through the National EnterpriseBoard has helped to preserve or create jobs. These have included several hundred thousand jobs at risk in the motor vehicle industry, as well asabout 70,000 jobs preserved or created through regional selective assistance.Several thousand other jobs have been preserved or created through help to firms in temporary difficulty and through accelerated project schemes.Pensions12. The Government have substantially raised the living standards of retirement pensioners, widows, and the long term sicfc and disabled. TheNational Insurance pension uprating in November last year brought the cash increase in the pension since the last uprating of the previous administra-tion to some 70 per cent and the increase in real terms to 15 per cent Overthe same period the real value of the pay increases gained by the averageman in employment were almost totally eroded by inflation. The Govern-ment have already announced further increases in National insurance pensions to take effect in November 1976, which will bring the pension fora married couple up to  24.50 a week, and that for a single person to 15.30. The pension rates will then be practically double what they werewhen the Labour Government took up office. The increase this autumnwill more than compensate pensioners for the rise in the cost of livingover the preceding 12 months. It will also considerably exceed the likelymovement in earnings between November 1975 and November 1976 andwill take the pension to a new peak in real terms. The Government havefully met their commitment to raise pensions in line with earnings for thewhole period since July 1974.13. So the attack on inflation has made a great advance since last July andat the same time the Government have been able to maintain their majorsocial priorities. But there are still great difficulties to be faced. Unemptoy-meat is still much too high. Wage costs per unit of output are still risingmore quickly in this country than in our main competitor countries. Andin the last few months there has been the unexpectedly sharp depreciation of sterling a problem intensified by an upturn in world commodity prices,which has increased the foreign exchange costs of essential UK imports.14. Inevitably, recent exchange rate movements have impeded ourprogress in the fight against inflation. Last July, the Government set a target of reducing the year-on-year increase in prices to single figures bythe end of this year. It is bound now to take us somewhat longer to reachthis target, but we should still achieve the objective of a further halving ofthe inflation rate by the end of 1977.
THE PROGRAMME FOR THE YEAR BEGINNING1 AUGUST 1976: THE PAY POUCY15. We are now entering a stage in our economic recovery in whichworld trade&apos; is increasing, and production the world over is growing to meetrising demand. This situation gives us *he best opportunity the country has had since the war for export-led growth, with all that means in termsof higher UK output and employment To get these benefits we have tomaintain the momentum of the attack on inflation and consolidate thegains made in the test V2 mcnUis. Diverting resources into exports and investment requires both a high level of competitiveness in our industry anda basic change in the structure of our economy. This change is essential if we are to have a good prospect of rising living standards in future years;but we have to absorb its impact on our present living standards. If we try to improve our living standards by higher money earnings, we shall onlyget more inflation; it is just no good paying ourselves in confetti. The best prospect for seizing the opportunity of export-led growth, and achievingsustained improvement in our living standards, is to get our inflation rate atleast down, to that of our competitors, and to keep it there.16. This was the objective to which this year&apos;s Budget proposals wereaddressed. For the first time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer offered tolink substantial tax reliefs with a pay limit consistent with a further halvingof the inflation rate. Following the Budget statement. Ministers embarked on intensive consultations about the next stage of counter-inflation policy:these culminated in the new agreement with the TUC on a pay limit for thenext year equivalent to an increase of about 4J per cent on average in wages and salaries. The Government endorsed the TUC proposal whichlimits increases to  2.50 for those earning up to  50 * week, to 5 per cent for those between  50 and  80. and to a maximum of f4 at all higher levels of earnings- Increases under the new pay limit, like those under its predeces-sor, will not be consolidated into basic rates. Because of the tight structure of this policy, the increase in average earnings to be expected over the nextyear is in line with that envisaged by the Chancellor when he proposed apay limit in the area of 3 per celt coupled with tax reliefs. The government therefore made clear on 5 May that, once the proposed new pay limit hadbeen ratified by. the TUC Special Congress on 16 June, they would imple-ment in fuM the conditional tax reliefs outlined in the Budget&apos;&apos; 17.&apos; People at work win benefit in three ways from the new pay policyand the tax reliefs associated with it::  i, they will benefit from the pay increase itself, us described in para-graph 16;.- it. they will benefit front the tax reliefs. By July or August, when allthe reliefs will be operating, the average family will already havebenefltted by as much as  30. The amount of benefit will vary withfamily circumstances and levels of income. The tax reliefs operatefrom 1 April 1976, and wiU be in payment by not later than August197*$. For most people this means that the tax relief operates very
much earlier than the date for their pay increase under the new agreement;iii. they will benefit because prices will rise more slowly than theywould with a higher limit. By the end of 1977 this reduction in inflation-tion is expected to be worth as much to the average family as a payrise for the breadwinner of  2 a week.Annex A shows the benefits under i and ii above for different families and income levels.Living standards18. The dramatic increase in oil and other commodity prices in 1973/74reduced our real national income by 5 per cent, at a time when we were already living beyond it by running an external deficit. The impact of thatfall in national income was cushioned for a period by increased borrowingabroad, but much of the unavoidable decline in living standards of peopleat work came through in the first half of 1975. We now have to face theeffects of the fall in the exchange rate and the need to direct moreresources to exports and investment, with the benefits which that will bringfor employment. The changes in the Price Code referred to later in this white Paper are part of this. But inflation will be lower, people at work will benefit from the tax reliefs linked with the new pay limit, and output and productivity will be recovering. Some further reduction in the real value oftake-home pay (affecting single people more than families with children)is a necessary condition for reducing unemployment and getting the balanceof payments right but the reduction in the real value of the average paypacket should be a good deal less than that experienced in the first half of1975 before the  6 pay policy was introduced.The pay limit for the   next year19. Annex B to this White Paper reproduces the TUC pay guidelines,endorsed by the Government for the coming year. These guidelines were adopted by an overwhelming majority at the TUC Special Cqngress. the cbi welcomed the TUC decision and said that their members would do all they could as employers to see that the guidelines were adhered to.20. Increases within these new limits, as under the current  6 policy,are to be applied as a cash supplement to earnings, and hi general the ioter-pretation of the policy in particular circumstances will be the same as fathe current: period. Like the  6 these are the limits within which the amounts of increases are to be negotiated. There are no transitional provisions; for allgroups increases within these new limits may be implemented 12 monthsafter the fitajof increase which they received in the previous period. for those to whom the  8500 cut-off applied in the previous period increasesmay be implemented 11 months after the date On which an increase would otherwise have been allowable. An increment which has been withheld solelybecause of the  8,500 cut-off may be paid with effect from a date&apos;12 monthsafter the date on which it would otherwise have been allowable; alternativelyan increment: Allowable&apos; on the later of these two dates may be paid; but hotboth. Separate increases in London weighting and other geographical allow&apos;-1
ances will not be payable in the 12 months from 1 August 1976; but suchallowances may be included as part of total earnings for the calculation of increases under the new pay limit.21. The Government attach the highest importance to maintaining theprinciple of a voluntary policy. They therefore welcome this further agree-ment with the TUC on guidance to negotiators within the framework of theSocial Contract; and they are confident that it will secure the same measureof acceptance and support as the  6 limit. These guidelines should beuniversally applied, and the TUC will oppose any settlement in excess ofthem. The Government will ensure strict compliance with the new policythroughout the public sector, as they have done with the  6 policy. Thearrangements and sanctions in Grind 6151 to secure compliance in both public and private sectors will continue to apply.22. The present voluntary arrangements through which the government now collect information about pay settlements and intended settlements willcontinue. So will the requirement to supply pay information to the price commission for the purposes of price control.PRICES23. Even at the lower levels we are now experiencing inflation remains a heavy burden on all sections of the community and especially the housewife.But the consumer can look forward to a lower rate of inflation in the next12 months than in the past year.24. During the last year we made a major and successful effort to reducethe pressure of wage costs on prices, and the new pay limit will mean a sub-stantial further teduction in that pressure. Bat there will also be new factorsat work. With the recovery of the economy from the recession, we can expectrising productivity to moderate the rate of increase in unit labour costs. Onthe other hand we shall have to contend with substantial pressure fromhigher import prices, not only as a result of the depreciation of sterling, butalso because of rising world demand for food and raw materials.The NatkMubaed bdnettks25. The operating deficits of the nationalised industries caused by price restraint have been eliminated. The exceptional price rises necessary for thispurpose have now happened and future increases will In general be lower,broadly is line with the reduced level of price rises in the economy generally.The British Railways Board have announced that they will not be seekingany further fare increase during 1976, and the Post Office Corporation have said that they do not intend to increase the main letter post rates in 1970,nor telephone charges during the rest of the present financial year.FoodSubcVfiea26. The Government have said that food subsidies will be progressively reduced as inflation is brought down and as social benefits are improved.But these subsidies still contribute substantially to the protection of people
on low incomes: over  400m will be spent on them in the year up to March1977.School Meals27. There will be an additional subsidy of  35m so that the price of school meals will not have to go up in this financial year.Price Controls28. The Government propose to extend for a further year from 1 August1976 the powers to control prices through the Price Code. There will continueto be both cost control and profit control under the Price Code and thePrice Commission will continue to enforce it. The Government are determined to ensure that the results of pay restraint by people at work arereflected in the price level and that a strict control is retained. Some changesin the Code are however needed in the interests of investment and jobs, andthey are described in a later paragraph. They are essential to our success in rebuilding industry and reducing unemployment.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND MONETARY POUCY29. Pay restraint and price control will not be effective in reducing the inflation rate unless other aspects of economic policy are also consistent with that objective. It is essential, therefore, that fiscal and monetary policy should contribute to the attack on inflation, and help the movement of resources into exports and investment. Failure to control public spending,or to ensure that the growth of the money supply does not stimulate inflation,would place the Governments programme in jeopardy. The Governmenthave already declared their determination to ensure that the planned public spending totals, including those for local authorities, are not exceeded. Inaddition, for the current year, cash limits have been extensively applied to individual public expenditure programmes, within the strict limits whichhave to apply to public spending, the Governments priorities will accord with the objectives set out at the beginning of this White Paper.30. In addition to exercising firm control of public expenditure theGovernment are determined to see to it that the growth in the money supplydoes not stimulate inflation. The Chancellor has said he will ensure that thegrowth of the money supply is consistent with the Gcvernmenfs plans forthe growth of demand expressed in current prices. The Government are equally determined that the expansion of productive capacity and exportsshould not be held back by competing public sector demands for finance.These policies will be reinforced if necessary by further action in the fiscaland monetary fields. Moreover, steps have been taken to ensure that the banks fully meet the needs of manufacturing industry for finance; anyexpansion of their business has had to be directed to meeting industry^needs for the expansion of exports, import saving, investment and working capital.
REBUILDING BRITISH INDUSTRY: JOBS AND INVESTMENT31. The key element of the Governments longer term programme forthe British economy is the effort to rebuild British industry. The essentialconditions for success are control of inflation, which destroys markets andjobs and undermines the confidence needed for investment; and the pro-vision of sufficient resources, real and financial, to get industry moving.On the one hand public demands on resources have For the present to bekept within tight limits. On the other industry has to be permitted, withinthe framework of the price control, to achieve sufficient profitability to generate the funds for investment and to offer the prospect of an adequatereturn on investment once undertaken. During the 1960s, the rate of return,after taking account of the need to replace fixed investment and stocks, wastypically over 10 per cent. By 1974 is was down to 2.2 per cent. This hascontributed to the recent slump in new productive investment and consequentloss of jobs. The downward trend in profitability must be reversed.32. The Government therefore propose a number of changes in thePrice Code to encourage investment and employment the main changes are as follows:  a. an increase from 20 per cent to 35 per cent in the rate in investmentrelief (that is, the proportion of the costs of new investment whichmay be reflected in current prices);b. provisions relating to the depreciation of assets and to the apprecia-tion of stocks which (in line with the general conclusions of theSandilands Report which the Government have accepted) recognise the damaging effects which inflation has produced;c. redefinition so as to take account of inflation of the categories into which firms fall, and which affect the procedures to which they are subject;d. measures to mitigate the present disincentive effect of the Code onimproving efficiency, induding the abolition of the productivitydeduction;e. other measures to reduce the administrative burden on companies of operating the. Code.The Price Cc^nmjssion&apos; monitors investment relief to ensure thatrelief is only claimed where investment is actually taking place. To qualify,investment must be in home-based industry, and in plant, machinery, com-mercial vehicles and the construction of industrial buildings and warehouses.34. - The Government do not expect that the changes in the price controlswill by themselves lead to any early or appreciable increase in the generalprice level. Market forces have ensured that the prices of many goods and services are now below the level which companies would be entitled to charge under the Price Code; but as economic recovery progresses, the code will play an important part in keeping down the cost of living. by july 1977, when present powers to control prices empire, it is estimated
that the proposed changes in the Code will probably have made a difference of about I per cent to the Retail Price Index.35. It is essential for out economic and industrial recovery that theresources released by these changes should be channelled into the productive investment in fixed and working capital which British industry needs to correct present weaknesses and secure a greater $hare of markets at homeand abroad. This is also the objective of the Governments industrial strategy,now being developed in collaboration with both sides of industry. A goodstart has been made in the first stage of the industrial strategy. The national economic Development Council is about to consider the first reports of the tripartite groups which have been working to produce proposals for actionin many sectors of manufacturing industry. Planning Agreements and theNational Enterprise Board will also have a key contribution to make to theregeneration of British industry.LEGISLATIVE STEPS36.  The Government will ask Parliament to approve;i. a draft Order in Council extending until 31 July 1977 the operationof the Remuneration Charges and Grants Act 1975 and of Part ii of ihe Counter Inflation Act 1973;ii. a draft Order to add this White Paper to Cmnd. 6151 for the purposeof the Remuneration Charges and Grants Act;iii. Ways and Means Resolutions and amendments to the Finance Billto give effect to the conditional tax reliefs.The two draft Orders are being laid before Parliament today and are subject to Affirmative Resolution by both Houses.37. Details of the proposed changes in the Price Code are publishedtoday in a consultative document by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection. After the consultations have been completed, theSecretary of State will make an Order to implement the amendments tothe Price Code, to take effect from 1 August. The necessary affirmative resolutions will be placed before Parliament.38. The present arrangements whereby dividends are strictly controlledwill continue as before.REALISM AND RECOVERY39. The Government said last July mat the programme set out in the&quot;Attack on Inflation&quot; was designed to save our country. Because that programme was adopted and implemented by all sections of the communityacting together we have averted economic disaster, and can now tackle withfresh hope the fundamental problems yet to be solved. We need to switchresources away from consumption towards exports and productive invest-ment; to get our inflation down to international levels and keep it there; to
conquer the social evil of high unemployment; to eliminate the current account deficit on the balance of payments; to adopt a new realism in our approach to public expenditure; and to accept that, for some time, living standards cannot increase in tbe way to which this country was accustomedin the years before 1973.40. The  6 pay policy and the other policies set out in Cmnd. 6151have given us a good start. We must build on these gains; we cannot riskthrowing them away. The recent decision of the TUC Special Congress is adramatic recognition of this. We shall have to maintain our policies ofcooperation and restrain! in poisuifl. of Ihe objectives outnned at tbe begin-ning of this White Paper. If we do this, the opportunity is there for us toreassert our place in an expanding world economy as a leading industrialnation which can again offer its people a rising standard of living and of social provision.

TUC PAY GUIDELINESThe tuc&apos;s pay guidelines agreed with the Government are set out below.These guidelines should be universally applied and the TUC will oppose any settlement in excess of them.i. It has been agreed that the guidelines for increases becoming operativein the period August 1 1976 to July 31 1977 should comprise a percentage increase of five per cent on total earnings for all hours worked with a cashminimum of  2.50 and an upper cash maximum of  4 per week. The figures will apply to all full-time adults (aged 18 and above) with pro rata payments for part-timers and juveniles.ii. This will be payable as an individual earnings supplement. It will entail employers each week calculating total earnings and adding five percent to the result. If the answer is more than  4,  4 would be added. If lessthan  2.50 results,  2.50 is likewise added.iii. The 12 months&apos; interval between major pay increases should continueto apply. Where no increase has been received since August 1 1975 becauseof the cut-off requirements of the  6 policy, the normal negotiating date should apply.iv. All other improvements including non-wage benefits should be kept within the overall pay figure except as provided for in the current policy;improvements in (or the introduction of) occupational pensions schemes upto the contracting-out level provided for in the Social Security Pensions Actcan also be implemented outside the pay figure.v. Negotiators will be responsible for ensuring that earnings do not increase beyond these levels. Where unions experience difficulty in interpret-ing the guidelines in relation to their own negotiating situation, they should approach the TUC for guidance.Printed In England toe Her Mafc*tr&apos;i Stationery Onto bj William) Lea.
