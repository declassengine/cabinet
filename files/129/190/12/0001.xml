DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 37 COPY NO28 June 1976CABINETSPEAKERS CONFERENCE ON ELECTORAL LAWMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The arrangements for the proposed Speaker !s Conference on electoral Law were discussed by the Cabinet on 18 November 1975,    Draftterms of reference for the Conference were, subsequently agreed with mycolleagues principally concerned and put to the Leaders of the other parties in a letter from the Prime Minister dated 13 April,    The replies to that letter from the Conservatives, the Liberals, the United UlsterUnionists and Plaid Cymru raise important points which the Cabinet will now wish to consider.    No reply has been received from the ScottishNational Party (SNP).ELECTORAL REFORM2,        The Liberals (and Plaid Cymru, though less strongly) have requested that the electoral system should be added to the terms ofreference.for the Conference; and the recent report of the HansardSociety Commission on Electoral Reform has stimulated public interest inthe matter.   This is largely a question for political Judgment and i recognise that, on balance, my colleagues may with to adhere to theCabinet conclusion last November that this topic should not be referred tothe Conference, although I do not myself agree with this view.DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS3.        Mrs Thatcher has asked fox the inclusion of Rule 1 In Schedule 2 tothe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 on the ground thatthis has led to serious under-representatfon of England in the UnitedKingdom Parliament relative to Scotland and Wales.    Mr Powell, for theUnited Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC), has asked for the &quot;adoption of a uniform or minimum electoral quota in the terms of reference for boundary commissions for all the component parts of the United Kingdom&quot;,   Thisproposal comes to much the same thing as Mrs Thatcher1 s.2
4.        Rule 1 deals with the allocation of seats between the various parts ofthe United Kingdom by providing that Great Britain shall have &apos;feotsubstantially greater or less than 613&quot;, Scotland shall have not less than71, Wales not less man 35 and Northern Ireland 12.   The Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland is opposed to any review of the number of seats in Northern Ireland at the present time.   In the devolution context, wehave said that &quot;Parliament ... will continue to include the presentcomplement of Scottish and Welsh Members&quot; (paragraph 296 of Cmnd 6348).We could thus reasonably refuse to agree to add Rule 1 to the terms ofreference.    Our grounds would be that the time is not ripe, given thecontinued uncertainty in Northern Ireland and the proposed far-reachingchanges in Scotland and Wales.    There would be a risk that the conservatives would then refuse to co-operate at all in the Conference; butthis is unlikely because we know them to be keen to discuss many of the items we have proposed.COMPOSITION OF THE conference.        The Speaker, in agreeing to chair the Conference, has asked whetherIt would be possible to reduce the numbers of the larger Parties in order to accommodate all the smaller groups.   The composition at presentproposed (but not yet put to the other Parties) is 15 Labour, 12 Conser-vatlves, one Liberal and one SNP.   I have some sympathy with the speaker&apos;s suggestion and I understand that the Secretary of State for northern Ireland would Uke to see UUUC representation.   This is,however, primarily a matter for the Lord President of the Council and theChief Whip, in consultation with the other Parties.conclusion,        On balance, I recommend that we should refuse at present to add tothe terms of reference the redistribution of Beats between theconstituent parts of the United Kingdom.   I hope, however, that it will bepossible to respond sympathetically to the Speaker&apos;s suggestion about the composition of the Conference.RH j home Office28 June 1976Z
