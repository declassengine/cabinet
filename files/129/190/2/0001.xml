IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT81CP(76) 278 June 1976COPY no cabinet the e.c. UNIFORM PASSPORTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. We need to determine our negotiating position in discussing the design of the proposed uniform European Economic Community (e.c.)passport with the other Member States.background.        It was agreed by the European Council in December 1975 that a uniform passport should be Issued by Member States from 1978,   Thisfollowed the decision by e.c. Heads of Government in December 1974 that a working Party should be set up to study the possibility of establishing apassport union and, in anticipation of this, the introduction of a uniformpassport.    The idea of passport union was not new.    There weresuggestions that such a union should be created shortly after the UnitedKingdom&apos;a accession to the Community, and at that time the idea was seen in the context of a possible e.c. citizenship - which is no longer in prospect.    The present proposal came from Chancellor Schmidt.   Work on other aspects of passport union (which Herr Schmidt and others saw asleading to the eventual abolition of passport controls other than those on the perimeter of the Community and to uniform visa and aliens legislation)continues.    But it is accepted by the Working Party that real progressbristles with difficulties: and we are not committed to reaching any conclusions within a set time.    What we face now is the limited problem ofthe form of the passport.    The passport will still be a national documentIssued by each Member State on its own authority.    But the design would beuniform and would be intended to create a sense of Identification with theCommunity on the part of the holder.    As the passport would be usedworld-wide its use would remind other countries of the existence andcoherence of the e.c.,1
3,        In agreeing that the passport should be issued from 1978 the thenPrime Minister made it clear that we would not be able to introduce it before the United Kingdom&apos;* projected nationality legislation came intoforce.    This is not likely to be before 1979.    This reservation on our parthas been accepted by our partners.4.        Some progress has been made at official level in clarifying the issues which require decision by the Council.   So far the British representativehas had to reserve our position and there is some danger that the viewsof the other Eight will have hardened to the point where a contrary view onour part will be an isolated one.    The design of a new British passport is however likely to be a sensitive issue for public opinion, and we shall need to negotiate hard for what we decide we want.   Although the design of the passport is a matter for executive decision. Parliament may need to be consulted later if it ie decided that the design should be laid down in an EECinstrument.C ONSIDERA TIONS5.        Six sample passport covers have been produced by the stationery office following alternative layouts suggested by the Foreign and commonwealth Office.    Copies of these samples will be available for inspection by members of the Cabinet at the meeting.    Photocopies are attached to this paper lettered A to F.6.        The words &quot;European Community&quot;.    The other Member States wishto place these words above the name of the issuing State on the cover of the passport and it may be very difficult at this stage to persuade them to change.    Since the passport will remain a national passport, the name ofthe issuing State indicating the nationality of the holder will be the feature of the cover most important to the British holder,7.        The Royal Arms.    The Royal Arms traditionally appear on thecover of a British passport and we should wish to preserve the dignity of the arms and preferably also their paramountcy In relation to the name of theCommunity, and even more In relation to any Community symbol.    SampleD achieves this best.8.        Community symbol.    No symbol has yet been officially adopted byany of the Community institutions.    The Commission have circulated a set of four designs to which we are not in any way committed (attached).    Butchoice of a Community symbol goes beyond the design of a passport, sinceonce a symbol is adopted for any purpose, It will tend to be used for othersand needs to be considered in that light.    The symbol based on a map of theCommunity, on sample passport E, is merely illustrative.    It would raiseproblems relating to, for example, Berlin, and new Member States.    Thesymbol on sample F is based on one of the designs short-listed by theCommission In a competition it held some years ago.    The problems in
achieving agreement on a common design for the passport would be reduced if we could avoid the us* of a symbol at all, at least at this stage,9*        Colour.    The samples have been made up In a colour whichoriginally found some favour among the other Member States.    The Dutchhave however obtained acceptance by the other Eight for a deep lilac colour.This was chosen because it is distinctive and unlike colours already in use for Members&apos;national passports.    A sample of the lilac colour will beavailable at the Cabinet meeting.10.       Languages.    The international practice has for many years been tause the national language (or languages) plus French and/or English.    TheGermans and the Italians want all official Community languages to be usedInside the passport.    This would be clumsy and might encourage Statesoutside the Community to depart from the international usage.    The otherMembers, apart from Germany and Italy, share our view on thepreservation of the international practice.    The Presidency have proposedthat page 1 should be in all six official languages and this might be acceptable as a compromise.    A specimen in this form produced by theFederal German Government will be available at the meeting.11.        Materials and &quot;windows&quot;.    The passport would be the same size as now but would have 32 pageB instead of 30; this would cause no difficulty.Some of the Eight may argue for standardisation of materials, but many members will wish to adopt safeguards against forgery, such as the use oftheir own security paper and watermarks.    While the adoption of a passportin a uniform style is desirable, it is essential that we retain freedom to incorporate those security precautions which we consider necessary.Other e.c. countries do not have &quot;windows&quot; in their passports and it is unlikely that there will be sufficient room for them anyway.DECISIONS SOUGHT12.       The Cabinet le invited to decide whether, in negotiating with theother Members of the European Community, I should be guided by thefollowing :-a. I should seek the adoption by the Nine of a design as insample D (although recognising that the other Eight have already expressed a preference for sample A or B).b. HI am unable to persuade the other Members to change to design D, I should accept design B, on the condition that in theBritish version the Royal Arms are given prominence.c. A Community symbol should not be incorporated in the design of the cover, at least at this stage.3
d. We should accept the deep lilac colour proposed by theDutch.e. We should re sist any departure from the international practiceof using the national language (languages) plus English and/orFrench, although we need not object if the Germans or the Italianswish to add each other1 s language in their version of the passport,f. We need to preserve the freedom to retain our safeguards against forgery.A foreign and Commonwealth Office8 June 19764
