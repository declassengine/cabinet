DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 29 COPY no. 8 June 1976CABINETENLARGEMENT OF THE EECMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsINTRODUCTION1. When Cabinet discussed the Greek application for membership of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) on 5 February (CC(76) 4thConclusions, Minute 2) it was argued that there would be advantage in considering the whole question of the enlargement of the e.c., including the implications of Greek membership for considering later applications from such countries as Turkey, Spain and Portugal,   When and how theseapplications will be made - and the associated questions of how theCommunity will evolve over the next five years or so - remain highlyuncertain.    So I think that there are limits to how far we can take our study.But I think we need to face squarely the fact that the admission of greece would mark a decisive moment in the development of the Community; itcould lead to the accession of other Member States and to a movement away from the relatively cohesive and integrated organisation which is theCommunity^ objective.    So I set out in this paper some implications as ageneral introduction to the subject.TIMING2.        When, first of all, can we expect the Greeks in, if their negotiations are successful?    The e.c. Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) may be asked to approve the formal opening of negotiations by the summer break at the end of July.   But effective negotiations will hardlystart until the autumn.     Our accession negotiations in 1970-72 took just over 18 months.   It is true that the Greek application will raise fewerproblems.   But there will still be a range of complex and difficult points onwhich not only will the Greeks negotiate toughlyf but agreement will bedifficult to achieve among the Nine,   Greek accession will not get the samepriority as the previous enlargement negotiations because of many otherurgent Items on the agenda of the meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the nine.    So unless the Greeks pursue tactics of blandly accepting all1
Community requirements I would expect the negotiations to take most if not all of 1977 and 1978.   And with a year for ratification this would meanGreek entry - still with a transitional period, but taking &amp;s we did a full part from the beginning in the institutions of the Community - in the second half of 1979 or in 1980.3.        What of the other candidates ?   Article 237 of the Treaty of Romeprovides that &quot;any European State may apply to become a member of theCommunity&quot;.    In recent years an additional qualification has been added byconsensus that candidates must share the democratic ideals of theCommunity or be &quot;pluralist democracies&quot;.    There is room for argumentabout how these concepts should be defined, but all Member States would agree that candidates must have Governments based on free elections and properly elected Parliaments.    Over the next few years the onlycandidates who seem likely to apply (and it is by no means certain that theywill qualify) are Spain and Portugal.    Turkey, Norway, Sweden and evenSwitzerland, Malta and Cyprus are conceivable candidates in the longer run.SPAIN4.        Spain (population 35 million and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head of $1, 750 almost on a level of that of Greece) is, it is hoped, about to resume negotiations for a trade agreement with the Community to take account of the accession of the three new Member States.   But thisagreement will contain no provision for eventual Spanish membership.5.        Since Franco&apos;s death Spanish Ministers have made it plain that their aim is to achieve membership.    This clearly depends on progress towardsreal democracy in Spain.    It is a matter of judgment whether, and if sowhen, Spain could achieve a system of government which could reasonably be regarded as a pluralist democracy.    They are likely to have serious problems with the Communist Party as well as with the Francoist &quot;bunker&quot;,with the Catalan and Basque separatist movements, and with the problemsof establishing a working system of free political parties and trades unions.They themselves are hopeful that they may be in a position to apply for membership of the Community after elections next year.   Even if all goeswell, it would not be surprising If this timetable slipped.6.        Assuming that a working pluralist democracy is established, none ofthe other Member States would see any valid reason for refusing to enter-tain a Spanish application.    The Spanish economy is more soundly basedthan that of Greece and more likely to withstand the strains of membership.France and Germany would both be strongly in favour.    There would besound foreign policy reasons for wishing to help a democratic SpanishGovernment of the day to defend the new Spanish, democracy and foxensuring that Spain was firmly anchored to Western Europe.    This is likelytobe the strong United States view.   The political costs abroad of a Britishveto would be high.    Nor should we forget the effect on Gibraltar.
7.        On the most optimistic assumptions about Spanish progress towardsdemocracy( it seems unlikely that negotiations for entry could begin before1979* with a consequent likely date for membership of 1982 or 1983.Whether Spain will adhere to this optimistic timetable it is difficult atpresent to assess.    (Spain hopes to put in an application in 1977 and enter by1980, but 1980 is hardly realistic for entry.)   But unless there is visibleprogress towards free elections and all that goes with it, things will movemuch more slowly or even grind to a halt.PORTUGAL8.        Portugal (with a population of 9 million and a GDP per head of$1,250) has a free trade agreement with the Community, amendment ofwhich is under negotiation,.    The Portuguese Foreign, Minister has said thatPortugal is not interested in full membership at the moment.   but important voices in the main democratic parties (the Socialist Party and the popular Democratic Party) have talked about following the Greek exampleand if they form a minority Government after the Presid^ffaf &quot;lections on27 June, the Portuguese Socialist Party may decide to apply for member -ship.    They are talking of getting in ahead of Spain.    After the turmoil ofthe past two years, the  Portuguese situation looks more hopeful.    By the summer there is a reasonable chance that a pluralist democracy may beestablished, albeit in hostile economic circumstances that may make it veryhard for democracy to survive.    The Portuguese economy, relatively weakbefore the end of the Right Wing dictatorship, has deteriorated further andis far from being strong enough to thrive on full membership at the end ofthe decade.   If they are wise, the democratic Portuguese leaders will makehaste slowly and we must encourage them to do so, while neverthelessextending sufficient encouragement and help towards membership in the longrun to give embattled democracy the support and encouragement it will need.TURKEY9.        Turkey is a less likely candidate in the next few years.    It has an association agreement with the Community similar to that with Greecewhich envisages eventual full membership.    It provides for the achievement of a full Customs Union, though not until 1992, compared with 1984 forGreece.    Turkey is much larger than Greece (population 38 million but farpoorer - GDP per head of $540),    Politically Turkey has maintained forsome years a balance between democratic form and military influence on government which has papered over the social, economic and politicalbackwardness of much of the country.    Turkish Ministers accept that turkey is not sufficiently advanced economically to proceed to full membership in the near future.   But they will be conscious mat Greekprogress in that direction will put them at a disadvantage; in the shortterm they will seek financial aid from the Community, improved access fortheir exports to the Nine and involvement in the political consultationprocess to balance Greek progress towards full membership.   And they willnot abandon their long-term claim of full membership.
OTHER CANDIDATES10.       Other candidates do not seem likely over the next five years or so.The Norwegians with their new oil prosperity will not wish to repeat thetraumatic experience of their referendum.    And it hardly seems likely thatthe European neutrals (Swedes, Finland, Switzerland and Austria) will want to join in the next few years.   Austria is formally precluded from doing soby the terms of the State Treaty, and Finland is precluded in practice by thenature of Its relationship with the Soviet Union.11.        To sum up, there has been some tendency to exaggerate the likelyspeed with which the Community may be enlarged.   Greece is likely to joinat the end of the decade.   Spain might conceivably join shortly thereafter.Portugal might join two or more years later.    Turkey is unlikely to be ina position to join before the late r80s.    In the &apos;80s Norway, Sweden andeven Malta or CypruB might change their minds, but the likelihood at themoment does not seem great that any of them will apply in time to joinbefore the xnid-&apos;80s.EFFECTS12.       What would be the effect of this pattern of enlargement?   I attach at annex A some indications of the sine of United Kingdom trade, and that ofthe Eight with the candidate countries and the proportion these represent ofindustrial and agricultural production of the Nine.    And I attach at Annex Ba note by officials drawn up last autumn which analyses the implications of greek accession.    We shall in due course need to set similar studies in train on Spain and Portugal.   But in summary the implications ofenlargement seem to me to fall under four main headings.a.    POLITICAL13.       A rebuff to the Greeks would have endangered the stability of theKaramanlls Government and increased the threat of a Communist or militarytakeover, thus weakening the Southern Flank of the North Atlantic treaty organisation and endangering the stability of the Eastern Mediterranean.The admission of Greece should contribute to the opposite results.    On theother hand the future of democracy in Greece will still be at risk even ifthey are full members of the Community.   And a Communist or militarytakeover after entry would create serious problems for the Community.Could the other Member States freeze the membership of a member wholeft the democratic fold ?    Much would depend on the circumstances at thetime and I do not think that we can come to a conclusion in advance.   (Thesame applies to existing members, eg Italy.)   Greek membership will causeawkward political problems for the other Member States if by that timeGreco-Turkish relations have not improved and if the Cyprus problemremains unsettled.    Greek membership will not add anything substantial tothe weight of the Nine in international affairs.4
14.       The pros and cons of admitting or vetoing a democratic Spain pointstrongly, as for Greece, against a veto.    The same danger of a failure of democracy would be present.    On the other hand, Spanish relations withthird countries would not cause such problems and a democratic Spain would add considerably to the weight of the Nine in the Community&apos;s relations withcertain parts of the world.    Much the same goes for Portugal, which would however add less political weight.b. ECONOMICIS.       The admission of one, possibly two or even three, relatively poor,substantially agricultural Mediterranean countries would have considerableeconomic disadvantages for the Community as a whole and particularly forus as one of its weaker members.    Our share of the Regional development fund and of the European Social Fund would be reduced.   And the newarrivals would be substantial claimants on Community agriculturalexpenditure which would be bound to Increase substantially,    Greekaccession alone could cost the Nine up to  150 million a year at 1975 prices(and the United Kingdom perhaps  25 million).   And Spain in particularcould be a major additional burden.    Thus our net contributions to theCommunity budget will increase.   And the possibility of our gettinganything substantial out of resource transfers from the richer to the poorermembers of the Community will be greatly diluted.    At the same time someof our older and more vulnerable industries, especially textiles, would face damaging competition without the safeguards given by existingassociation agreements.    And we would face protectionist pressures - inthe form of resistance to cuts In Community tariffs on the products ofMediterranean agriculture.c. POLICY MAKING16.       Over a whole range of Community policies, existing and emergent,the new entrants would pursue interests different from ours.    In external trade they would join the more restrictive and inward-looking members ofthe Community (in particular France and Italy); In terms of agricultural policy they would join with the French and Italians in exacting as high a priceas they could for the support of Southern European agriculture.   They would try to squeeze as much as they could out of Community regional and socialexpenditure; and this would be a drag on the development of Communityindustrial policy and would make progress towards Economic and MonetaryUnion even less likely than it is now.d. NATURE AND MANAGEABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY17,       But what will be the effect on the nature and manageability of theCommunity of the admission of one and possibly three SouthernMediterranean countries?   Even now the Community has barely digestedthe three new members it took in 1973.    Would a Community of 10 and evenmore so 12 - with the Commission suitably enlarged to provide for Greek,
Spanish and Portuguese Commissioners and with three extra languages -have got past the point of unmanageabllity ?   And to what extent would thecentre of gravity of the Community be shifted towards the south where thereare fundamentally different attitudes towards taxation and administration?18.       I think that we have to face the fact that there will be somesubstantial disadvantages both in the economic field and in terms ofmanageability of the Community,   It will be a Community different from theone we joined and more difficult to manage.    It can, of course, be argued -particularly if the Community&apos;s functioning continues to improve - that new members joining one by one at Intervals over the next six or seven years or so could be assimilated.    There will be a desirable side effect in the sense that the advent of between one and three new members over the next 10 years as different from the existing members as Greece, Portugal and Spain willreinforce the trend already evident away from a fully-fledged federation inEurope.   And we need, of course, to remember that the disadvantages of have to on Greece or a democratic Spain or Portugal would be very serious.But we should be clear that whatever the justification on balance for the admission of these new members and despite the fact that there are somemitigating factors, the disadvantages both for the Community and for theUnited Kingdom of their admission will be marked.19.       Should we therefore veto or openly delay the Greek negotiations andthe possible accession negotiations for democratic Spain and Portugal later on?   As I have said already the political arguments against this seem to mecompelling.    There are certain things which we could do.   We need to insist on a full examination of all the detailed points of interest to us whichwill arise in the Greek accession negotiations and to ensure just as theFrench did in 1970-72 that full account is taken of our interests.   And wecan be confident that other Member States will also Bee difficulties for themand will be doing the same.    Secondly, we need to set in train a study of the implications of the accession of Spain and Portugal on lines similar to theone we have done in relation to Greece.    And, thirdly, this general problem may come up with the other Foreign Ministers of the Nine at thenext very restricted Schloss Gymnich type meeting in the second half ofthis year when Greek megotJationg will probably be under way.    If so, myaim would be to try and bring home to the French and Italians some of theeconomic disadvantages attendant on the admission of Spain and portugal and to my colleagues generally the difficulties of manageability which severalnew members would cause.   But I would need to be careful not to appear totake the lead in opposing the admission of new members.20.      Another possible course would be to alter the decision-makingmachinery of the Community so as to put powers of decision in the hands ofan inner group.    This could take the form of the &quot;directorate&quot; whichPresident Giscard has recently floated.    Or it could be a version of the two-tier idea originally put forward by Herr Brandt and taken up again in theTlndemans Report.    I do not think that ideas of this kind would work either.6
For an inner decision-making group to consist of the major powers in theCommunity would be unacceptable to the smaller countries.    For adirectorate to consist on a basis of rotation of certain of Ihe majorcountries and some of the smaller ones would run up against the obviousobstacle that neither France, Germany nor we ourselves could countenanceexclusion even for a period.   And if we sought to give second-tiermembership to some of the new members this also would be fiercelyresented and would not get general Community support for the practical reasons which I mentioned earlier that no-one would wish to damage theirown interests In these countries by seeming to want to take the lead incondemning them to an inferior role.2L       A better course would be to intensify bilateral contacts at all levels between ourselves, the Germans and the French.    The Germans andthe French and the Germans and ourselves already have such contacts.   Iam taking steps to promote Anglo-French contacts of the same kind atofficial level and although it is more difficult to get on with the French than with the Germans I shall see what we can do to get it agreed that the french foreign Minister and I should meet bilaterally about twice a year and with similar arrangements between President Giscard and the Prime Minister,It would be an illusion to imagine that, given our present economic difficulties, we can be as important to the French and the Germans aB the irrelations with each other.    But I think we can establish a better workingrelationship with the French if we put a bit of effort into it.   And this could be combined with some simpUficationB of working procedures.   ways in which we could make the Community work better will be discussedduring the consideration of the Tinderoans Report which will, usefully from our point of view, probably be coming to the decision-taking stage during theBritish Presidency.CONCLUSION22.       The admission of new members will not on balance be to our advantage.   We can take some comfort from the fact that they will probablybe joining one by one and at intervals over several years, and from the factthat their accession will strengthen the trend against European federation.If we can establish a sound working relationship over the next three or fouryears with the French as well as with the Germans and we can take somesensible steps to improve and streamline the decision-making processes andif we can meanwhile push Community policies firmly on to lines whichbetter meet our requirements it may be that the Community would be able toassimilate the likely new members without its manageability getting out ofcontrol.   But we shall have to face the fact that the economic disadvantageBfor us will be substantial, and that it will be difficult to run the community in ways satisfactory to us.   I do not think that outright veto or delay wouldbe a practicable policy In terms of the admiasion of new members.   But I7
think that we ought to set on foot now a study of the Implications of portuguese and Spanish accession and that I ought to be prepared to discuss this question in confidence with my colleagues in the Community at the nextSchloss Gymnich Foreign Ministers meeting.A foreign and Commonwealth Office8 June 19768

ANNEX BGREEK AFPLICATlCtf FOR OGMKUNHY NMBERSHIPi   practical implications FOR THE UNITED EQTCDCK1.    This paper assesses the praotioal Implications for the United Kingdomof Greek membership of the CoEouaity;   and indicates the objectives we should pursue and the interests we should aim to safeguard in forthoatning Comunitywork on the Greek applications&apos;I.     BACKGROUNDa.    The Greek Econooy2&apos;.     Sane basic facts on the Greek econooy are sxcarised at Appendix A-   litemain, points are -a. Greeoe has a GDP per head of 11,790 (1973 estimate) - a little underhalf the Cocmunity average.   Compare Ireland, the poorest existing nenberof the Ccraaunity, with a ODP per bead of 12,130;   Spain with *lj750(Portugal with $1,250;   and Turkey with $540,b. In 1971 40 per cent of the Greek working population of 3*3 Billionwere in agriculture - a high proportion as can pared with other SouthernEuropean countries, except Turkey.   The industrial sector remainedrelatively small, at sooe 17 per cent of total employment.c. Services (including tourism and shipping) and remittances fromworkers abroad are of major in portance to the economy, but are vulnerable to econonio developments outside the Greek OovernmenVa control.d. Over 50 per cent of Greece &apos;s visible import and export trade is withthe nine e.c. countries!   Germany and Italy are the two largest suppliers,with market shares of 17 par cent and o psr oent respectively.  But Greeoeaccounts for only l per cent of total e.c. exports, and only 0*4 per oentof total e.c. in ports.e. The value of United Kingdom exports to Greece in 1974 waa 105 million^   imports fron Greece were worth about  68 Billion,5
b. The e.c./Greece Agreement3.    The e.c./Greece Association Agreement (entered into force in 1962), wasepeoifically designed to pre para Greece for full membership of the Community inthe period up to 1984.  Under its provisions all Greek industrial goods and a wide- range of agricultural products already receive duty-free entry into the six.   Since November 1974 a largo proportion of the Six*s industrial and agricultural exports to Greoce have also been clirty-froe,   jjy July 1977 the nowMember States Will give and receive the sane treatment as tho original member states.   The remaining Greek duties on the enlarged Coununity&apos;s industrial goodswill be progressively reduced, and abolished by 1984, when full Custone union will be aohievod.   After 1977* when the safeguard provisions at present availableto the three now Member States end, United Kingdom scope for taking action againstimports from Greece will in effect be United to the measures available under theSEC Treaty.4.    The Agreement also provides for the hamonianXion by I984 of agriculturalpolicies between Greece and the Conaunity, to Enable Greece gradually to adoptarrangements oa the lines of the CAP.   Little progress has been node in this area so far.c. Prospects for the Greek Economy5.    The Greek economy grew rapidly in the 1960s and early 1970s.   There wasnonetheless a considerable net outflow of labour abroad, nalnly to western europe and particularly to Germany where over 200,000 Oreeks were estinated tobe working in 1974-   Substantial continuing deficits in overseas trade werepartly offset by workers1 remittances from abroad and by earnings fron shipping and tourism.   In 1973-74 growth was checked fi*st by economy measures to counterinflationary pressures, then by political instability, tho Cyprus srisis, anda- deteriorating balance of payments.   Given the uncertain prospects for theinvisible earnings on which Greoce is heavily dependent the balance of payuenteis likely to remain a major constraint.6.    The aim of successive Greek governments has been to change the eooncoy byprogrammes of agricultural rationalisation and industrial development.   If thisis to be achieved, a considerable adjustment will be required.   the modernisation of agricultural production is likely to release a supply of relatively cheap labour into tho manufacturing sector;   this could provide a6
stimulus but surplus labour will not be easily absorbed and the protection ofemployment in both industry and agriculture 1b likely to bo a major continuingoonoern of Greek governments,   lhe prooess of modernisation nay be encouraged by the existing e.c./Greeoe agreement, and might be further accelerated by fullDeabsrshtp of the Community.   But it is uncertain whether the Greek oconaoy asit stands oould sustain the continuing in pact of integration with the Conounitywithout speoial protective and support arrangements, although Greek JCinistersand Officialb have expressed their confidence in their ability to meet theregaining commitments under the Association Agpeeosnt an tine and even to accelerate them.II.   ECCNCIIIC IKPLICiiTKWS OF GREEK A0CE8SICBa.    Trade and the B&amp;laaoe of Payoents7.    Huoh of what would be involved in Greek membership of the Com unity - inparticular free trade and the harmonisation of agricultural policies - isalready provided for in the e.c./Oreeoe Agreement t which has applied to theUnited Kingdom since 1 July 1975*   In the longer tern, full aeBbership nl^ittend to inorease Greece&apos;s (already oonsiderahle) dependence on the   community of Nine as a trading partner.   But the direot effects on visible trade -including our own trade balonoe - would ba small.   On the import sloe forexaople, acoess for most of our food imports froo Greece (sons  25 millionworth of mainly Mediterranean produce) Is already duty free.  It Is likely that the effects on invisibles would be equally slight.   Greece, does notccnpete significantly with the United Ktngdco in the provision of financialand other service a in international markets (other than shipping, which is mentioned below) and In any case the direot impact of Community neBbershlp onInvisible trade - given the limited degree of haxmonlsation achieved In this field so for - is relatively modest.8.    On capital movements, there is no risk of any significant balonoe ofpayments cost from Greece1! bsocoin  a fall member of the Community until weare In a position to meet our obligation to liberalise outward direot in vest-meat e to other Member States, and theft only if Oresoe should bsocos ouch ooroattractive to united Kingdan invest ora.  let United pa&amp;m outward direct investment in Greece totalled only  4*0 million in 19731  &quot;*t inward Invest-meats were even mailer.

Details are at Appendix B. ^a j&quot;-, i kW10.  G*eek aenbasship-of the Coonunity eould have a-significant impact-in thefield of caxiercial policy.  From the United Kingdom standpoint it might welladversely affect the balance of econonic interests in the   Community as a whole.Following Creole accession, Groooe^ Italy and fertooe;icoul^ to^fetner- bW&quot;expebWlto foro a &quot;Mediterranean blood&quot; in view- of their common interests in suchcommodities as wine, olive .qU,* tobacco and citrus;   this would strengthen thopressure within the Coaauni^ tpwa^ds^^ater^p^o^ectionisn in agriculture,-and would make it more difficult to obtain the fvj-ther improvemente which we,are seeking in access for foo4 imports froa third-countries   The special problem of agriculture apart f.the,Greeks might -tend to side with those elements in the Cozmunity^whic^ f^yre^a^yaly i^^^f(reeted.^,devaloping trade withthird countries, and would b* care ponoerned with retaining protected marketswithin the Community (although they will continue to attach importance.to their trade links with their Balkan neighbours).. Greek membership would thereforemake it more difficult to ensure that the Coqmunity follows a liberal andoutward looking approach in the GATT multilateral trade negotiations and in commercial polioy generally.b.    Agriculture11.   The Com unity i8 already committed, under the e.c./Greece agreement, todiscussions with Greece on the haraonisation of agricultural policies.   Becauseof the backwardness of - Greek agriculture, harmoni section will involve major improvements in the structure of&quot; halaljfgf and&quot; Greece has already sought grants from FEOGA of 150 mua for this purpose. -&quot; Under the Association Agreement theharmoniaatica process could extend over the period up to 1984 or even later;if Greece became a full-mentor of the Ocoeunity it Is likely that a lengthytransitional period would stLll be required, but the pace of Greek adjustment to the CAP would almost certainly be accelerated with a consequential increasein the cost to Community funds and hence to the United Kingdcc.8
12.   Many of the agricultural commodities of most interest to Greece - inparticular wine, fruit and vegetables and olive oil (see Appendix At Table 5) -are also of importance to sensitive producer interests in Italy and France.Negotiations on the transitional arrangements governing Greek accession to theCotam unity in these areas are likely to be difficult.   In general we can leave it to the other Member States directly concerned io make the running:   butthere is a real risk that Italy and Franca may demand compensation - in theform of increased subsidies from FEOGA, or of increased protection againstimports from third countries, or a mixture of both - for the damage theywould allege Greek membership would cause them.   Any such compensation wouldinvolve additional costs to Community funds or to United Kingdom consuners,and we should need to resist it, or if necessary, to argue that we wouldrequire compensating concessions on access for food imports or the internaloperation of the CAP to offset the costs we would face.13*  More generally, the strengthening of Mediterranean agricultural interestsinside the Community as a result of Greek membership would make it moredifficult for us to secure the improvements we are seeking in the operationof the CAP.   In particular it would be harder to contain&apos; CAP price levels andFEOGA expenditure, especially for Mediterranean commodities like wine andolive oil.   There would be a consequential cost - unquantifiable, but possiblysignificant - to United Kingdom o on aimers and to public expenditure, withoutcommensurate benefits for our own agricultural producers.c.    Financial Aspectsi.    The Community budget14.   Greece would be a substantial net recipient of funds from the community budget if she were to become a full, member of the Community.   She would,therefore impose a. budgetary cost on the other Member States including theUnited Kingdom.   The cost is diffioult to quantify, and will itself depend onthe outottos of the accession negotiations with Greece;   but on the assumptionsoutlined in Appendix C full Greek membership in I98O or soon after could cost the Nine up to  150 million or so a year and the United Kingdom perhaps 25 million a year (in 1975 prices).9
15,   Otmm^ grosB budget contribution would probably be quite large, in proportion to her eoonoaio weight in the Community.   In the longer tern,full membership might tenfl to reduoe Greek dependence on Imports from out-side the Community.   But in       period up to 1990 (and perhaps for sons timethereafter),, she would be likely to pay heavy levy end duty payments on imports of beef and lamb, and third countries are likely to oontinue tosupply a large proportion of her manufactured goods.   This would mean paying the full c.t. on these imports.   In 19?6, Oreeoe&apos;s gross contributions oouldbe about 3 par oent of the Budget while her. share in.Community GDP would be only some 2 per cent.16.   But Greece&apos;b budget receipts would probably be even larger.   There aretwo reasons.   The largest single item is likely to be payments from FD004,which would be subrtantial in view of Greece&apos;s large agricultural seotor -perhaps up to  150 million a year by 1?80.   secondly, with a very lowstandard of living, Oreeoe would be likely to reoeive substantial payments from both the Regional Fond and the Sooial Fund - perhapa totalling some 110 million by I98O.   These reoeipts oould together amount by 1980 to6 per oent or more of the budget.   Retails of the calculations are at appendix C.17.   Aa a net recipient from the budget, Greeoe would not be eligible forreoeipta from the Budget Correcting Meohanism.   But Greek membership would increase the size of the budget and thereby increase   the maximum size ofthe Correcting Mechanism, whioh in turn oould lead to Blightly greaterUnitad Kingdom reoeipts.il.   The Sooial Fond and the Regional Fund19.   The estimate of a new budgetary oost to the United Kingdom.of around 25 million as a result of Greek aooeaaion to the Community takes aooountof the impact of Greek membership in two areas of Community expenditure -the Sooial Fund and the Regional Fund - in whioh we are at presentsignificant net benefioiaries.   Our net receipts from; the; Regional Fundare expected to amount to around  60 million over the three years 1975-77;our net allocations from the Soeial Fund in 1974 were over  13 million.In both areas there would be a risk, if Greeoe joined the Community, ofa reduction in our share of receipts and/or an increase in our contributions
to help finance increased expenditure under the two Funds.   Even if wewere able to avoid a significant deterioration in our net position, Greekaooession would increase the ooet of the Fund to donor oountriea likeGermany, whose resistanoe to further expansion of Community expenditurein these areas would be strengthened.   So the prospects of a worthwhilenet return to the United Kingdom in the longer term would be greatlydiminished.   This in turn would reduoe the soope for alleviating the adverse impact of the Community budget on the United Kingdom through thedevelopment of Community expenditure polioies from whioh we oould expect to benefit.19*   It will be in the interest of all the existing member states to minimise the cost of Greek aooession to the Community.   He however willhave a particular interest in pressing for the firmest possible safeguards for existing net beneficiaries from expenditure under the Sooial and regional Funds.   Specifically, it may be necessary to resist pressure to treat Greeoe as gemerouely as say, Ireland.   It is; likely to be to our advantage to have the past-1977 &quot;shape of the Regional Fund (in particular the per oent age *keyt by whioh the resources available are distributed)Settled in advance of the confirmation of Greek membership.20. A detailed assessment of the effect of Greek membership on the social and Regional Funds is at Appendix C.ill.   The European Investment Bank and the European MonetaryCo-operation Fund 1.   The first financial protocol to the mc/Oreeoe Agreement provided forlending from the KB to Oreeoe in the period 1962-67.   A second financialprotocol Is now under negotiation, whioh is likely to pre-empt a sub-stantial proportion of the limited funds available for lending to non-member states.22. While Greece remains a non-member of the Community her demand forSIB loans can be seen in the context of the Bank*s oapaoity to lend to non-Members.   There is no competition with funds destined for the1United[Kingdom.   If, however, Greece were tp become a member, her demandfor project loans would compete directly with our own.   Given that nofurther increase in the Bank&apos;s capital base is currently in prospect,it ia likely that some of the money at present coming to ua would bs
diverted to Oreeoe,   The consequential loss is difficult to estimate;hut the EXB is a useful aouroe of loan finance (loans totalling 211 million have been granted to &amp;&amp;te) and it is for consideration whether we should aim, in the oontext of the Greek accession negotiations,to secure arrangements designed to ensure that the Bank will continue tohave adequate funds available for lending to the United Kingdom.23,   As a member of the Community, Oreeoe would be entitled to participate.-w   : - : .&apos;v.   . \i&quot;in the Bhort-term facilities administered by the European MonetaryGo-operation fund, under whioh oredit may be extsnded to members who arein balanoe of payments difficulties.   The United Kingdom would have toincrease its contribution to the Fund accordingly - perhaps by  5 million.d.     Other Aspects24.   An assessment of the implications of Greek membership of the community in the fields of movement of ^abour. health and sooial security, transport,the environment, energy policy. EURATpft and ECSC is at Appendix B.   the impact in most of these areas would be marginal. . Greek accession would however be likely to bring forward the date at whioh free movement of labour(already provided for in the e.c./Greeoe Agreement) 1b achieved betweenGreeoe and the Community.   This could raise difficulties for us, particularly if It accelerated progress towards free movement of labour with Turkey.Ill,    INSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF GREEK ACCESSION25.     The institutional arrangements within the Community are weightedaccording to a rough population oriterlon.   The population.of Oreeoe (9 million)seems likely to give.lt a weighting compensation&amp;rable to that of Belgium (10 million).Greek Membership would require adjustment to the Treaties to give Greeoe fullparticipation in the institutions on the same lines as those set out in theTreaty of Aooession in 1972 (Part two, Title l).   The main changes would be -a.    The Assembly.   The number of seats allocated to Greeoe would depend on how at that time the Assembly Itself had developed, what its size was and espeoially whether there was a uniform prooedure for the direct   election of Members by universal suffrage in aooordanoe with12
Article 138 of the e.c. Treaty.   At present Belgium has 14 seatsout of 198 (7 per oent) but this proportion would he likely to diminish if the Assembly^ present proposals for expansion (thePatijn Beport) were accepted.b. The Counoil. The Rotation of the Presidency, and the weightingsfor qualified majority voting would need to &quot;be changed.o.    The Conniesion,   A Greek commissioner would be appointed, withthe opportunity for him to take his turn se Vice-president (assuming the present organisation of the Commission).d.     The Court of Justioe.   A Greek judge would be appointed.e* The Economic and Sooial Conlttee. The Membership would need to he increased, probably by a further 12 seats (4 in each group),if Belgium is the pattern.f.    ECsC Consultative Committee.   An increase of Membership wouldalso.be neceseary, but its precise size would depend-on calculationsabout the sis* and strength cf that sector of Greek Industry.26.   Greek Membership would unless the existing rules were changed, whiohwould be very difficult to oohieve, require an additional language to beused, with substantial but unforeseeable oonseqaanoes for linguistic(translators and interpreters) and oleriasl/dooumentary staff in each ofthe Community institutions.   In addition, Greek officials would need tobe appointed to each of the institutions, though it is not likely thatthere would be an equivalent disturbance to that which faced the Communitywhen the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland aooeded in 1973.   A **** Bharefor Greeoe (comparable to Belgium) in the Commission or the CounoilSeoreteriat would be about 5 per oent of the Senior (A) grades, and a comparable proportion among other grades.   The Commission has not yetBade   any Btudy of the praotioal problems involved but the difficulty of bringing in Greek staff, who would of course have to be linguisticallyqualified, would partly depend on the financial climate at the time, the speed with which it wae decided to bring them in and how far new poetscould be added to the existing complement without the need for compensatingreduction among nationals of other member states,
27.   More generally, the Community^ decision-making machinery does notwork easily, even with nine Members!   each additional member and additional language is likely to compound the practioal problems ofmaking the Community operate effectively.IV.   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS28. The main conclusions of the foregoing analysis of the likely practicaloonsequenoes of Greek membership of the Community are as follows -a. In comparison with the rest of the Community the Greek economy is backward, and, although progress has been made in recent yearsand the Greek Government seem confident about the future, it is by no means olear that the Greek economy oould stand closer integrationwith the Community without special protective arrangements.b. Greek Membership would strengthen the pressures within theCommunity towards greater protection in agriculture, and trade (atleast in agricultural produce), and would make it more difficult tokeep down.the oost of the CAP and to ensure the Community followeda liberal and cutward-looking approach In oommorci&amp;i policy.c. As a full member of the Community Greece would be a substantialnet recipient of funds from the Community budget (perhaps as muoh asC150 million a year).   She would be likely to obtain substantialpayments in view of her large agricultural sector from FEOGA, andin view of her relative backwardness, from the Sooial and RegionalFunds - possibly directly at the expense of United Kingdom receipts,d. The difficulties involved in making the Commuaity*s decision-making machinery work effectively would be compounded by the additionof a new member and a new working language.14

Imports of finished products, mainly plates and sheet, amounted to 16,600 tonnes in 1973and to 1,500 tonnes in 1974.   Exports, mainly tinplate, plates end w^rcrod, T/ero 58,000 tonnes in 1973 and 40,000 tonnes in 1974.   Steel importsfrom Greece into US pay the full rate of duty, io up to 8Tt for SCSC products.UK exports to Greece are liable for duty varying between fcjl and 24;* for most finished products.The Greek steel industry is expanding.   Its current crude steelcapacity is about 1.5 million tonnes and it Is reported that this figure is to be doubled by 1977.  Raw steel production in 1974 was reported&quot;tobe 850,000 tonnes, having increased from 450,000 tonnes in 1970.   Outputof rolled products is also increasing.   In general, i-f-seecis lively thatGreece&apos;a accession to the ECSC would have little impact on the UK iron andsteel industry.   In view of the planned expansion of tho 3teel industryin Greoce, however, there could be some benefit to the UK in bringingGreece into the Treaty of Paris reglr.o, in particular within tha ;;:CSC pricisSrules.

These provide that each reeiabsr stale will extend to mi-rantworkers iroo other member states the some social security benefits, Corexample in respect of unemployment sicJaioss and rcUrecent, as it provisosfor itn orm workers.  The regulations also provided that member states will extend free of low-cost medics! treatment to &quot;visiting nationals o:&apos;othor nenber states on the same teras given to their own people.

There is already an Association Agreement T/ithGreeks under which freedom of movement of Greek workers is envisagedthough the date and manner of implementation have still to be decided.The numbers emigrating from Greece to the rest of the world havebeen falling from 92,000 (68,000 to Europe) in 1970 to 27, 000 (15,000to Eurcoe) in 1973.   Part of the reason for this may be that unenplovncrvfcin Greece has been concurrently falling.   The numbers entering the UKto work have also been falling but only a few hundreds are involved.In tho 5 years 1970/74 about 3,100 Greeks entered this country to work.Germany has been more of an attraction to Greek labour than the UnitedKingdom..  It is hard to say how many Greeks would cone to this country forwork if there wero free mo.- ement.   The opening of our labour market to the Italians when we joined the Community did not result in anyflood of Italians coming here.   It may be that if large nua-ers uere tooone here they could create social problems of the kind with which weare familiar in connection with other groups.   If unemployment were highthey could also be an embarrassment from an economic point of view.However, if unemploymsnt were lower than at present they night make a useful contribution, as former immigrants have done, to manning sectors of the economy which are perennially short of labour.Free movement of Greeks must be. considered in the context of free movement of Turks and Cypriote,  There is an Association Agreement bctv-een ,Turkey and the E3C which envisages the free entry of Turkish workers intothe Community not later than the end of 1986.   &apos;.7e know that the G-orr.-:r,3are worried about an early influx of Turkish workers and wo should behesitant about the desirability of tils for similar reasons.   If the Gres^3secured free movement with the Community it would become rather moredifficult to put off the date of implementation of the Agreement with the Turks.

THE COCJ-ICTISY AS A WHOIfiThe assessment of the implications of Creek cesberchip for thebudget (paras 15-13 of the ir-ain paper) has been based on a crudeforecast of Greek contributions to and receipts froa the budget in 1930 on the assumption that Greece is a full member of the eec and subject to the own resources system.   In practice, Greececould probably not become a fully integrated Community memberby 1930.   But the analysis of 1930 facilitates the forecastingexercise without, it is hoped, blurring by too much the basicimplications of Creek membership.2.     The forecast is as follows:F330GARE?E3FOR refundsTotalGreek receipts1504070..10*270(Cm 1975 prices)Greek contributionsIndustrialdutiesAgriculturallevies anddutiesVAT5050140Other budget expenditure (administration, aid etc)   30Mote: calculations based on an exohange rate of  1-1.7 ua.3*     Details of the forecast of FEOGA expenditure are given in paras 9-12 below.4.    The considerations underlying the forecast of receipts fromthe Regional Fund (REP) are outlined in paras 13-17 below.   1*is estimated that Greeoo will receive l6  of the Bund.   Thisshare aasunes that Greece will receive the same RHP expenditureper head of the population as Ireland does now.   Ireland receivesgenerous treatment from the Riff1.   In practice, Greece mightnot do as well:   this would bs a matter for negotiation.   Inthe long run however Creek aooession seems likely to increaseCommunity expenditure through the RIP; for the purposes of theprooent exerciser lS  increase in total RDF expenditure has teen22f CONFIDENTIAL&apos;,
assumed.    Total IZDF.expenditure in 1?50 (ijicludinj Creece)       estimatedat about 400 mua, (in constant prices).5.     The forecast of receipts fron tho Social Fund (2SF) is based on asimilar methodology to tho RDF forecast - ic that Greece will be treatedas generously an Ireland.   Total Social Fund expenditure is expected to bsincreased by Greek accession to a total of about 700 due by 1980.     this assumption is probably over-generous.   The factors affecting current andfuture Community expenditure under the Social Fund are discussed inparagraphs 1G-23 below.   Kowever it should be noted in particular that theoperation of the Fund is duo to be   reviewed in 1976 and thus the exactahape and scale of the Fundfs activities by i9so are particularly difficultto predict,6*     Own resources (OR) refunds, are 10 per cent of forecast levy andduty payiaents.   Other budget expenditure is forecast as a proportion ofthe increase in the size of the total budget,   (This is probably an over-estimate),7,     Industrial duties are forecast on the basic of an estimate of industrialimports from third countries in i98o and an industrial tariff rate ofabout 6 per cent (after allowance for the Tokyo Round of tariff cuts).   the forecast of agricultural levy and duty payments is discussed below(paragraph 12),8.     VAT payments in i98o are based on an estimate of the Creek share ofthe total Community VAT tranche and an estimate of the total size ofthe VAT call-up (derived from the budget renegotiation forecasts),2.     FEOGA BTJEKDITUJE9*    The effects of Greek membership on Community expenditure and receiptsin the agricultural sector need to be considered under 3 headings -*(i)   Increased expenditure due to internal market actions forexport subsidisation,(ii)   Reduced expenditure where, for instance, the Communitycurrently pays an export restitution on exports to Greece.(iii)   Increased levy and duty revenue.10.   It Is difficult to produce more than extremely tentative estimatesat this stage, if only because of the poor data on Greek agricultureavailablovto us.   Assumptions also have to be made about levels of import levXes, export restitutions and internal Community subaidies.Taking the rates applicable in 1975/76&quot; the effects of Greek membershipcan be summarised as adding in the order of 250 million ua to grossguarantee and guidance expenditure, to which should be offset thepossibility of increased &quot;own resources&quot; receipts and reduced expenditureon export subsidies currently paid on trade to Greece of the orderof 60 million ua, but possibly rising as high as 100 million ua.23(CONFIDENTIAL)
11.     These calculations do not take any account of either any possible compensation demanded by France and/or Italy for allegeddamage, or of any extra guarantee payments for olive oil etcin respect of Italian or French production displaced by Creekproduction - both of which are unquantifiable at this stage.12*     The main elements in the estimate of 250 mua are as follows.(i)    Increased Guarantee Eroenditure - The main iteas wouldbe tobacco (around 110 million&quot; ua)V&quot;olive oil (about100 million ua), durum wheat, citrus and other fresh andprocessed fruit and vegetables (around 10 aillion uaeach).(ii)    Increase in Guidance Section - This is highly speoulati&apos;&apos;There is little doubt that Greek accession would increaseexpenditure under this head.   The gross figure of 250million uniis of account includes en arbitrary allowance of 10 million ua to increase the limit under the guidancesection.(iii)    Increase in Ot.?i Roflouroes Income - This arisesmainly in the meat section -&quot;principally beef (some 50 to55 million ua which could rise to some 90 million ua ifthe OECD forecast of a doubling of import requirementsby 1978 is realised).(iv)    Savings on Current Export Restitutions - The mainitem here is milk&apos; products (b million ua&apos;).3-    REOIOHAL PEyElOKflSiT FUND13.    The extent to which the three net beneficiaries stand to gain from the present Bund (is from 1975     OTf) 1&quot; **roaof maximum gross receipts per bead of population varies oon-siderably, as follows:14.    The Greek ODp/head is lower than Ireland^ sad ift pro-bably in line with the level in the Messogioroo.   If the Creekshad to be treated as generously aa the Irish fiepublio - onthe basis that the Greek population (8.769m) is g0a* three times that of the Irish RepubHe (2.9760) - Croeoe would haveto have 18 per sent of the fund.   It is clearly filing to bedifficult to aeooianodate a Greek quote of 16* per cent withouta significant reduction in the present OK share Of 26%   Perexample, if all the existing national quotas wore reduced by18$ to provide for a Greek quota (and the Irish and the Italiansmitfrt well be able to avoid suffering such a reduction) theeffect would be to reduce our share to 23$ which would make theIrish RepublicItalyUK2d ua9-5 ua6*6 ua
; - n... - 7 v - - - fUnited Kinjgdon a not contributor to the RDF, on the assumptionthat our avorage contribution to tho Community budget in 1976-79is 22-24 per oent.15.     The precise impact of Greek, accession to the Conarunity on,the existing Member States1 shares of the Regional Fund wouldbe a patter for negotiation.   The Conflsunity night well be unwilling to concede the Greeks a share on the 3arae scale a3the Irish for a population three tines the size; and greece would not have the sa?.e leverage as Ireland had at the tiiae ofthe original decision on shares.   Account would also bo taken of Greece1^ substantial net beneiits from the CAP and theSocial Fund.   Against this background, it is possible thatthe Creek share of the RD? night be held within the range10 to 15 per cent, at least in the period immediately followingaccession.   Even on this relatively favourable assumption,however, the UK share of the Fund would be reduced to around24 or 25 per cent.16.     The UK*s share of the RDF must significantly exceed its contribution for the Fund to bs of value to us.   The prospectof achieving this lead with Greece as a member looks poor.   IfSpain, Portugal and Turkey were alsoto join it eocns inevitable that the UK would becwae a net donor country.   Even if Greecewas treated rather less generously her accession must beexpected to limit our gain fron the Fund.17.     The net donor countries will also lose by the accession of another net recipient.   This io likely to influence thoirapproach to the future of the Fund and nay lead them to workhard to avoid any increase in the size of the Fund after 1977*As a result even if we continued to have a larger percentageshare of the Fund than our percentage contribution to thebudget there would be a greatly diminished prospect of a worthwhile not return from the Fund.4.    - SOCIAL FUND18.    The European Social Fund exists to provide financialassistance for training and resettlement schemes which not onlyenable workersjEo obtain and retain stable employment butalso fcelp industry \o keep pace wxVn &quot;the dciLaJids of technicalprogress.   It operates two main budgets:(a)    Under Article 4 it can Intervene in areas specificallydetermined by the Counoil of Ministers.   The groupc ofworkers who benefit by decisions already made are workersin or leaving the textile industry, workers leavingagriculture to tako up employment elsewhere, migrantworkers, disabled workers and young people.25
(b)    Under Article D assistance from the Fund is availablewhere employment difficulties impede the harmonious dovelop-nent of tho Community especially in areas which are lessdovclopyd or are suffering from a decline in majorindustries leading to a prolonged and serious imbalance inemployment.19.     The total budget of the Fund for 1974 was 260 mua (50 muaunder Article 4; 210 murv under Article 5).   Grants approved bythe Commission for Member States totalled 254.5 mua of whichtho UK share of these allocations was almost 25$, compared witha contribution (for 1974) of 11$.20.    There are no fixed shares for Member States in the SocialFund.   Applications normally exceed the Funds available and al-locations are made by the Commission on the basis of a systemof priorities and with tho advioe of a Tripartite Committeeon whioh all Member States are represented.21.    An initial hypothesis would be that if admitted to the Ooa-munity, Greece would quite soon become a net benefiticary from   &apos;&apos;the Fund and that to some extent the UK&apos;s competitive positionin securing allocations would be weakened.   This hypothesesis however subjeot to a number of qualifications.   Assistancefrom the Fund is granted only in strict compliance with theRegulations.   Applicants must satisfy the precise requirementsof Artiole 5 or of the authorised schemes under Article 4*A preliminary attempt has been made to assess the likelihood ofGreeoe being able to meet the requirements 1-*.     agriculture in I9T1 two-fifths of tho Greek labour force was in agri-culture; only 17-^ of total employment was in theinductrial sector.   If membership of the Community- resulted in industrial expansion Greece might thereforesoon be able to mount significant applications under theArtiole 4 Agriculture Scheme.b.    Migrant WorkersMigration is an important factor influencing tho Greeklabour market over the longer term, although the rate of migration and the number of migrants employed - par-ticularly in Germany, the main host country - haverecently deoreased.   The Artiole 4 Migrant Scheme isstill fairly new and the policy of the Commission is not fully developed.   It is stated in their third annual report on the Fund that dear priority will be given infuture to integrated programmes carried out jointly bythe Country of origin and the host Country.   If Greecetfttf
becomes a member of the Coiuiaviity there will oWiounly boa possibility of a joint Grcfii-Gcrr-irJi Scheme reoeiviv.;&apos; ahitficr priority thxn 13JC schemes on behalf of third countrymigrants which have zo far ac^rert -tor us tho lio:Ti; ch:&apos;.rethe money available under the sjyhf/ne,c.

Tnis points to the possibility of Creeps benefitinfrom Structural Ac-adjustment Schemes whether under theexisting Article 5 or under a new Article 4 Scheme whichthe Council is expected to authorise later thia year;although the shortage in Greece of training infrastructureand training personnel night be a limiting factor.23.     It is might difficult to quantify the not benefit Greecenight be expected to receive fron the Social fund,   ihie is notsiiaply because of the faniliar difficulties of forecastingtwo yesrs or wore ahesd.   There is no certainty that if andwhen Grce?-o is edr.permitted to the Co:ranunity xhe chape of the SocialFund and the an sis tar. ce available from  it will resemble at allcloacjiy t!&apos;-osc that appertain today.   Ihc working of the SocialFund is due to be reviewed by the Commission in 1976.   In commonno doubt with the other IlesVer States we chall want to suggestchanges in the objectives and procedures of the fund.   It isalso to be noted that scher.es approved by the Council underArticle 4 are usually introduced foi* a limited period only sothat for oxanrole the existing scheme for assistance to migrantt:orkcrs will lapse in Jane 1977-   Any. fresh schemes that ic*sybe introduced will of course table  account of the conditionsin the Community at that time?
