OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCF(76) 31 COPY NO     818 June 1976CABINETPROCEDURES FOR THE COMMUNITY*S AGRICULTURALPRICE-FIXINGMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food. In March the Ministerial Committee on European Questions askedofficials to prepare a paper on the Community^ machinery for decidingagricultural prices.    The ideas and conclusions in the attached paper by my officials have been discussed in that Committee and were broadlyendorsed.   A study of our strategy for next year&apos;s price-fixing (includingthe question of the Green Pound) is being made separately and will beconsidered by Ministers before the summer recess.    La the meantime Iconsider that the changes in procedure proposed in the attached paper should be helpful.Z.        Changes in procedure to our benefit normally have to be negotiatedand it is necessary to judge whether the price would be worthwhile.   Aswe shall hold the Presidency in the first half of 1977, however, we shouldbe able to ensure that the discussion of the price proposals is betterstructured and that reasonable consideration is given to the Presidency^compromise (paragraphs 10-U of the attached paper).    Similarly we should then be in a good position to reinforce our objective of increasing theCouncil&apos;s awareness of the budgetary cost and the cost to consumers, whether,    or not our more immediate and specific proposals (paragraphs 8-9 of theattached paper) on these aspects are accepted.3.        On our own arrangements for next year*s negotiation Cabinet hasalready agreed on the need for a clear remit.    The timing of the Councilmeetings in 1977, which I have proposed separately, Is intended to allowadequate opportunity for reference back to colleagues.   I have also made clear that I would welcome representation from other Departments,particularly in the final sessions when there may be a strong political willon the part of other Member States to reach agreement and, aa on the lastoccasion, it would be disadvantageous to the United Kingdom to break off.4.        I recommend that my colleagues endorse the procedural objectives in paragraphs 9-12 of the attached paper.T F ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food8 June 1976
1ANNEXPROCEDURE FOR THE COMMUNITY&apos;S AGRICULTURAL PRICE FIXING-NOTE BY THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODIntroduction1   The Ministerial Committee on European Questions decided on18 March that officials should prepare a paper on the Communitymachinery for deciding agricultural prices.   This subject wasalso dealt with in a memorandum put to the Cabinet by the thenForeign and Commonwealth Secretary (C(76&quot;)4t).2   This paper deals only with the procedural questions,   A furtherpaper on our strategy and objectives for the 1977 price-fixinghas already been requested by the Committee on European questions and will be provided well before the summer recess.   In themeantime we have assumed the continuation of the United Kingdom*sbasic objectives towards A&apos;   ^vements in the operation of thecommon agricultural policy .vhich were considered in detail by ministers last year.Community, machinery for deciding a?yricultural prices3   On the basis of data supplied by the member states the Commissionestimates each year the increase in costs on a sample of &quot;referencefarms&quot; and the trend in farm income in relation to incomes outsideagriculture.   This information is used to calculate the average increase in Community support prices which the Commission will propose, after making allowance for increased productivity and taking account of any changes in the agricultural reference ratesfor the currency of the different member states.   The proposalsfor price changes, however, also reflect the Commission^ financialand political judgement.   In particular, the Commission clearly hasthree important objectives.   First, they would not wish to putforward price proposals which are demonstrably unnegotiable or are likely to stir up substantial political discontent.Secondly, they are committed to maintain or improve the balance in the market for individual commodities;   experience shows thatthe Commission (for example, in the sugar shortage and in its
CONBDENTtM.proposals on milk prices) is generally more ready than the me*b**states, taken collectively, to tackle these imbalances.   Thirdly-they are conscious of the high budgetary cost of the common agricultural policy although, unlike the United Kingdom, they ***perhaps most concerned about the big increases in expenditureresulting from declines in the market value of currencies witho^corresponding adjustments in the agricultural representative f^681For all these reasons the price proposals may be expected to *eheavily tailored from the original crude estimate of agriculture1costs and incomes.   We can influence the Commission^ proposal^through our day to day contacts with them and in the final stageSthrough the United Kingdom Commissioners.4   The Commission aims to present its proposals on agricultural -support and prices to the Council of Agricultural Ministers iflDecember.   Even after one or two general discussions, at leas*two substantive negotiating sessions   of the Council are neededbefore agreement can be reached in February or March.   It is *erydifficult and uses a large stock of negotiating capital for asingle member state to introduce into the package a completelynew element.   We are much more likely to be successful if we **o**by trying to steer existing arrangements or proposals in a direction which suits us rather th^n to oppose them outrightforward something quite SiffererA.   It is better, for example tto exert pressure to contain increases in support through theexisting mechanisms than to argue for exactly comparable suppor*through a different mechanism.5  Under the present procedure there are normally two opportunities **efor adjustment of the Commission^ proposals - the Presidency16compromise and the Commission^ own compromise which forms thebasis of the final negotiation.   The Presidency^ compromise i9 *trial balloon used by the Commission but it does give a chance *0introduce a very limited number of new elements and to restralnmore excessive demands.2
Possible changes in procedure and machinery6   We have considered possible changes in the machinery for fixing Community agricultural prices under four headings -   thepreparation and use of data;   bringing to bear the budgetaryconsequences;   bringing to bear the consequences for resourcecosts;   and the organisation of the negotiations and use of the presidency compromise.   Some of these changes could be useful.They can never be, however, a substitute for progress on the issues of substance.   It is not possible to substantially disturb thebalance without a major political row within the Community whichwould spill over not only into the monetary arrangements from whichwe benefit but also into other areas of Community policy*7   Preparation and use of data.   We have already taken steps tofollow up our suggestion during the last price negotiations thatthere should be fuller consultations with the member states aboutthe Commission^ objective method calculations before the results are carried forward as the basis for price proposals.   Improvementscan be made in the preparatory work on the objective method for determing the level of support price increases judged to benecessary to keep earnings on modernised farms moving in line with non-farm earnings.   Work is in hand in the agricultural departments to consider whether we could suggest to the Commissionimprovements in the data and the methodology.   Other departments with an interest in agricultural price questions are welcome toparticipate fully in this work.   We have already taken part in discussions on the construction of an index of agricultural incomes,which could provide a useful check on the Commission^ particular, price proposals or on demands by other member states for biggerchanges.8   The budgetary consequences of changes in agricultural,8upport and prices.   Although the Commission sets out the budgetary consequencesQf its.proposals,we believe that this can be improved and appliedto a longer period of years.   We have considered whether the finalpackage might be negotiated in a joint session of Agriculture and finance Ministers but, whether or not this would be beneficial to us, we are sure that it would not be negotiable with other member states.   We believe, however, that it would be advantageous to us to have an arrangement by which the collective view ofFinance Ministers could be brought to bear on all member states and3
on the Commission at the time when price proposals are being formed.This points to a joint meeting of Finance and Agriculture ministers in the late autumn to consider the economic and budgetary factors which should influence the price proposals and the subsequentdecisions on them.   Such a meeting could reinforce the arguments for restraint on public expenditure but we must recognise thatit could not set specific limits within which expenditure would be contained.   The idea also has some risks for the United Kingdomsince the expenditure on monetary compensatory amounts, fromwhich we are currently one of the chief beneficiaries through importsubsidies on our food, would inevitably be one of the first areas where the Council would look for savings, and there are other areas where we have favoured higher budgetary costs in the interest of consumers.   The proposal had a mixed reception at the Joint Foreign/Finance Ministers&apos; Council in April when the Irish and the Frenchobjected to it but we should pursue it, while recognising the potential problems for us.   Alternatively, there could be a meetingof Finance Ministers after the proposals are published.   This would be easier to arrange next year, as we have the Presidency, but on balance it would probably increase the risk of pressure on the monetary arrangements.g      The resource costs of the common agricultural policy.   Injoining the Community the United Kingdom accepted the fundamentalsof the common agricultural policy and its central place in Communitypolitics.   Although we sought improvements in renegotiation andare continuing to seek improvements, we have to recognise that other member states regard the overall resource costs as tolerable,even though they  may be critical of particular aspects of thearrangements.   They regard some misuse of resources by economicstandards as part of the price to be paid for political stability.Against this background our approach must be to secure recognition that the extreme cases of resource misuse lie in the productionof surpluses.   We should continue to press for the improvementof (market regimes - and we have already made progress in thisdirection in the beef sector - but it would be wrong to concentrateon1mechanisms to the exclusion of better price decisions.   In allthe sectors where surpluses arise at present - railk^durum wheat,olive oil and tobacco - it is the level of returns available tothe producer rather than the mechanism for achieving those returnswhich is the primary cause.   We should therefore continue to pressA
the Commission to set out in their price proposals their assessment of resource costs, especially in those sectors where they are proposing special measures to restore or maintain a balance in themarket.   The need to deal with the structural surplus in the milksector is of particular importance and our objective must be to ensurethat the proposed arrangements for the financial co-responsibilityof producers, which the Council is due to discuss before September,are effective and are not subsequently undermined by pricedecisions. We need also to represent to the Commission theneed to consult thoroughly with consumer as well as producerrepresentatives when their price proposals are being drawn up,Thia may help us in attempting to represent the consumer pointof view when the Council considers prices.   It would also be helpful if our negotiating team included a representative fromthe Department of Prices and Consumer Protection.10   Organisation of the negotiations.   In the past the Councildiscussions have often been badly structured.   Occupying the presidency, we should be well placed to influence this so thatthe Commission^ proposals are considered as methodically aspossible by the Council and its subordinate bodies.   From thepractical point of view we should seek to improve the working hoursof the Council.   It could also be useful to seek for a widermeasure of delegation to the Special Committee on Agriculture of decisions on the smaller issues-   It is obvious that the finalpackage considered by Ministers is not only substantial but alsovery complicated.   It is possible that through our own Presidencywe can make some small progress in reducing this load.   While in the presidency we may be able, however, to provide more time forconsideration of the various compromise packag&amp;B which tend to emerge during the final stages and to ensure that attention isgiven to the economic and budgetary implications, it will also be part of our duties to ensure that a settlement is reached without undue delay.11 We shall need to consider further our tactics during the presidency.    In particular, we shall have to decide how we handle the presentation and content of the Presidency&apos;s compromise proposal during the negotiation of the package.   The two most recent compromises from the Presidency fell very flat indeed.5
We cannot lay down any fixed rules in advance but we should tryfar as possible to ensure that the Presidency^ compromise isproperly considered at a full meeting rather than lost in themelee.   We have proposed a pattern of Council dates which would allow for this.   On balance it seems likely to be to our advanta^to try to increase the importance of the Presidency^ documentyear as the most likely opportunity for continuing to exertrestraint on price increases in the final stages.12  The Cabinet agreed on 11 March that it would be desirable for the Ministerial Committee on European Questions to be asprecise as possible about negotiating limits when giving guidance to negotiations about farm prices and the extent to which referback might be required.   We believe that the pattern of Councilmeetings which we have proposed for the 1977 price-fixing willmake clear when the final settlement is likely to be reached.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has already indicated that he would welcome the presence of Ministers orsenior officials from other interestedIepartments at the point when decisions on the final package may have to be reached in brussels if we are to get the best settlement.CONCLUSION13   This paper deals only with the procedural issues.   A further study of our strategy for the 1977 price-fixing, including our     !handling of the Presidency and the monetary questions, will berequired.   In the meantime we consider that - !(i)   we should press for fuller consultation between the commission and member states before the results of theiCommission^ statistical and economic studies are carried forward as the basis for price proposals;(ii) we should seek improvements in the Commission^ presentati**&apos;of the budgetary consequences of price proposals;(iii)   we should seek to establish regular joint Councils ofiFinance and Agriculture Ministers to consider the budgetary     1and economic implications of Community agricultural supportthe Commission^ price proposals are finalised^(iv)   we should press the Commission to set out in their priceproposals an assessment of resource cos-fcs^ and to consult aconsumer organisations when they are formulating their propo9^^(v)   we should try to make the maximum use of the Presidency&apos;8compromise in the negotiation of the price package;
(vi)   we should so arrange the meetings of the Councils ofMinisters (Agriculture) during our Presidency that there is adequate opportunity for reference back to capitals in the negotiating stages.   Xn the final sessions it would bedesirable for junior Ministers or senior   officials of other interested Departments to be in the United Kingdom negotiatingteam.We recommend that these proposals, set out more fully inparagraphs 7 to 12, should help towards the efficient conductof the price negotiations in our interest and that we should therefore put them forward.7 June 19767
