The administrative arrangements for aPrice Commission and a Price Code will continue.   Firms will continueto operate under general profit ceilings and in addition the generaltest for price increases will continue to be whether there has been a;increase in costs.   At the same tine, within this broad frameworkthere will he changes to permit British industry to raise the fundsthat are needed to finance a higher level of activity, to increaseemployment and to instil the confidence needed to invest for thefuture.
4.   The rate of relief on investment has been 20% since May 1975-That is to say, firms are allowed to raise prices in the year inwhich investment expenditure is incurred to the extent necessary to recover one-fifth of that expenditure from current price revenue.The Government are proposing that the present rate of investmentrelief should be increased to 35%*   If there is to be a continuingform of prices policy after the next 12 months in which investmentrelief is appropriate, the Government intend that equivalent relief on new investment should be maintained as an integral part of the regime.   The Price Commission will continue to verify that the actualinvestment expenditure is undertaken during the investment year andthat not more than the amount of relief permitted       has actually been taken in prices.Depreciation and stocks5-   The Report by Sir Francis Sandilands&apos; Committee on InflationAccounting has demonstrated that, in a period of inflation, the apparent profits indicated by company accounts drawn up on ahistoric accounting basis may conceal the fact that the firm isnot making sufficient money even to replace the assets it hasconsumed.   In the company sector the real rate of return (ie atreplacement cost and after deduction of stock appreciation) is very low and has fallen over the decade from 1965 from around 1056 toaround 2%.6.   The Government have accepted in principle the conclusions of theSandilands Heport.   The Inflation Accounting Steering Group is currently considering what new accounting standards are needed togive effect to the Sandilands recommendations.   This is a complextask, and the Steering Group&apos;s timetable precludes^ new accounting
standard before the new Price Code cornea into force.   The Governmenthave accordingly had to consider how the new Code can take account ofthe message of the Sandilands Report, without prejudicing therecommendations of the Steering Group, in the accounting rules asthey relate to:a) depreciation;   and b) the treatment of stocks.depreciation7.   The Government propose that the new Price Code should broadlyrecognise the fact that the historic cost method makes too littleprovision for depreciation.   The Current Cost Accounting (CCA)techniques recommended by the Sandilands Committee would permitfirms to value assets for depreciation in various ways designed tosnow their value to the business.   The present Price Code precludesfirms from using the revaluation of assets for the purpose of PriceCode depreciation if the revaluation has taken place during theperiod of the controls.   This limitation will be removed in the newCode in respect of revaluations shown in companies&apos; annual accounts.The majority of firms will, however, be continuing to depreciateagainst historic cost for other accounting purposes during the 12 month period under consideration, and figures thus arrived at will ingeneral make inadequate provision for the replacement of the assetsconcerned.   The possibility that the Price Code itself shouldincorporate accounting rules for the indexing of depreciation, onthe baBis of the Price Index Numbers of Current Cost Accounting thatare now being published by the Central Statistical Office, has beenconsidered but rejected for two reasons.   First, Price Code provisions
on this subject drawn up now are likely to differ substantially fromthe full accounting standard that will eventually be issued, so thatfirms would be obliged to adopt procedures purely for pricing purposes,only to change them again after a short time.   Secondly, the rules for the selection and application of indices would leave room fordispute and disagreement, with the result that many firms wouldprobably feel that they were not equipped to undertake such complexcalculations.8.    In the interim period, while a new accounting standard is awaited,the Government have accordingly concluded that there should be ageneral marking-up of historic depreciation charges for all PriceCode purposes (where there has not been a recent revaluation).   this cannot be a precise or scientific provision for adjusting historiccost to CCA accounting.     It is no more than a broad adjustment toimprove the position until a new accounting standard is in operation.It has the merits of presenting no problems of calculation to firms or to the Price Commission. The adjustment factor proposed is 1.3. Thismoves some way, but not all, towards replacement cost.9.   The supplementary provision affects both the cost controls and current profit margins.   There will be no adjustment of referencelevels or other base data.   Claims for depreciation are checked inby the Price Commissiondue course against the company&apos;s annual accounts /   and revaluationwill be admitted only where it has already appeared in such accounts.Stocks10.   Just as historic accounting in a period of inflation may mean that a firm which is apparently profitable is consuming its capitalstock, so it may mean that apparent profits are in fact little more
than the rising value of stocks, which have to he replaced at highercost if the business is to keep going.   The Sandilands committee recommended an adjustment to reflect the current cost of each sale,and this also is one of the technical issues under consideration bythe Inflation Accounting Steering Group.11.   Here again, the Government propose that pending agreement on anew accounting standard the Price Code should include an interimadjustment moving towards the objective of the Sandilands Committee&apos;conclusions.12.    Increases in the cost of materials are among the allowable cost increases which can be reflected in price increases under the Code.For this purpose, it is proposed that all firms should have the option of calculating the cost of materials currently consumed onthe basis of the latest contracted purchase price as defined in-the Code.13.   Notional stock profits can also affect the position of firmsunder the net and gross profit controls in the Price Code,   A relief for stock appreciation is already in operation for purposes ofCorporation Tax.   The system is familiar, and it is proposed thatcurrent gross and net profit margins under the Price Code shouldbe abated by a similar method so that paper stock profits cannot leadto a profit excess in comparison with reference levels.   To take account of the fact that reference levels will remain unadjusted, a deduction will be made for the proposed relief analogous to the deduction made for tax purposes.   The amount of the deduction proposedis 30% of the increase in stock values (not a percentage of profit,as for tax purposes) in the relevant period.
14.   This stock relief will make it easier for firms to finance the materials they need when business activity turns up, and will facilitate the replacement of stocks when costs are rising.   Stepswill be taken to ensure that the relief is not abused,   tfirras willbe required to inform the Price Commission of the volume increasein their stocks, and further enquiries will be made if there is reason to suspect that stock levels have been manipulated to bringabout unjustifiable price increases.   These aspects of the newrelief will be monitored closely by the Price Commission.Productivity Deduction15-   The productivity deduction has been a feature of the PriceCode since its introduction by the Conservative Government in 1973 ata level of 50%.   In December 1974 it was reduced by the present government to a standard rate of 20%.16.   The  6 a-head pay policy has reduced the rate of increase in labour costs, but even so increases inevitably constitute a largeelement in firms&apos; total costs especially in the more labour-intensivesectors of industry.   The productivity deduction prevents firms fromfully meeting higher wage costs and therefore can have an unfavourableeffect on employment.   In today&apos;s circumstances the productivitydeduction can be dropped with no significant price effects and a useful benefit in providing jobs and simplifying the controls.   the deduction will, however, continue on a transitional basis for payments under escalation and variation-of-price clauses in contracts concludedsince the introduction of the Price Code.
Efficiency and cost savings17.   It has been represented that the Price Code can be a disincentiveto firms which expand output or cut costs, because any reduction in costs per unit of output should be entirely reflected in the price,and cannot be applied to improve profit margins.   The cash value ofa margin will he reduced if there are cost reductions, whether as aresult of greater efficiency or because increased output leads tooverheads being more thinly spread.   A similar result can occur ifexports rise as a proportion of total output, since the fixed cosfcsallocated to home sales are likely to be proportionately reduced.1Q.   The Government have looked carefully at the proposition thatthe Price Code should cease to be expressed solely in terms of costs per unit of output and should be re-constructed, for firms which foundthis helpful, to permit the optional use of &quot;input costing&quot;.   Theyhave concluded that the link between prices and actual output costsmust be retained, and that a radical restructuring of the Code on anoptional basis would not be Justified.   However, within the frameworkor the general rules, it is proposed to introduce new provisions todeal with the effect on overhead costs described in the preceding paragraph.   For calculations involving changes in overhead costs, halfof any future growth in output will be disregarded, so that firms willhot lose the whole of the benefit of the lower costs which result from increased production and exports.   For this purpose, fixed costs will be taken to include those categories of non-wage labour costs,such as national insurance, which are not at present subject to the productivity deduction.   As a special incentive to the more economical
use of fuel, any finn which can reduce the unit output cost of fuelfrom a base date will be permitted to retain the saving and willnot be required to pass it into the price.   The base date for thepurpose of these new provisions will be the date of the most recentprice increase preceding the introduction of the new Code.   Thepresent output costing rules will continue to apply to those labour costs which are subject to the productivity deduction in the presentCode.   There will be no change in the output costing rules as they apply to materials costs, since the Government consider that savingsresulting from lower costs should be passed on in full to the consumer-Pricing Flexibility19.   A central feature of the new Code will continue to be the link between increases in costs and consequential increases in prices.The Government accept the need, however, for a degree of flexibility.This has existed in earlier versions of the Code, but for the nextphase the Code will set out clearly the extent to which individualprices can be restructured.20.   The basic rule will be that the average increase in prices fora range of products (weighted to take account of the value of sales of different products) should not exceed the total entitlement arisingfrom the cost controls.   Within this total, the principle in the Codewill be that the individual price increase (in percentage terms) shouldnot be more than twice the average increase for the range.   Firmswill only  be permitted to increase individual prices beyond thislimit if:a)     the individual price increase is not more than %;or
b) the individual price increase can be justified by reference to a disproportionate increase in the costs for that product;   orc) the Price Commission are satisfied that it is the firm&apos;s established commercial practice to maintain a particular pattern of differential price increaseswithin the range;   ord) the Price Commission are satisfied that a higher price is justified for a particular product in thelight of the limited extent of recent price increases on the product or of the period which has elapsed since the price of the product was last increased; ore) pricing flexibility between different types of packor outlet has been permitted under the present Code.It is not, however, proposed to provide for flexibilitybetween different localities, since the Government donot consider it equitable for a customer&apos;s price increase in one part of the country to cross subsidiseanother.21.   There can be situations of market dominance in which a re-structuing of prices may be desirable so as to ensure the best useof resources and hence the greatest ultimate benefit to consumers.The Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended such a restructuringin a recent report on plasterboard, where it is considered that thechange from a system of uniform delivered prices to a system of zonalPrices would be likely in the long run to make for a more competitiveand efficient trading situation.   It is proposed that the new Code
should make provision for price restructuring, where this arises from a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report and where the case for action has been accepted by Government and reflected in an order or undertaking under the Pair Trading Act 1973*Net profit margin controls22.   The Government see no need for any radical new approach to the setting of profit ceilings through net profit margin controls.   Asa general rule, they believe that a ceiling derived from the actualperformance of the individual firm is the fairest approach.   Theprocess of establishing reference ceilings has been completed.   TheGovernment rule out any modifications to the structure of control(such as its re-formulation in terms of a return on capital) whichwould require firms to start all over again with new calcuationsunder a different system.23.   At the same time, experience over the past three years of price control indicates that the general rules may produce harsh andunintended results in particular cases.   The Government accordinglypropose some modifications in the general rules for the calculation of net profit margin levels, and also intend that there should bemore use of the facility for firms to obtain modifications to their individual reference levels.24.   The most important of the general changes to the net profit margin controls will result from the accounting changes discussed in paragraph above.   In addition, the other changes proposed inthe general rules are as follows: ^
a) Firms will be permitted (but not required) to take account of their moat recent accounting years up to july 19?6 in the calculation of their reference levels.b) Current profit margins will be monitored over arolling 12.month period, within which firms can setexcesses against under-recovery.25,   The present Price Code provides for the Price Commission to&quot;permit some departure&quot; from a reference level in certain circumstances.For the next phase, the criteria which guide the Price Commission inperforming the function of raising reference levels will be clarified.Distributors26.   The distributive trades have faced difficult trading conditionsover the last two years.   For many distributors, costs have risenfaster than turnover, and the consequent squeeze on their profit margins has been accentuated by depressed demand and keen competition.27.   In these circumstances there are limits to the extent to whichthe market would enable distributors to take advantage of anyrelaxations in the gross and net margin controls in the Price Code.The Government have oarefully considered the representations putforward by the Retail Consortium and other interested organisationsthat the ceilings on distributors&apos; gross percentage margins Should be abolished or that at least the 10% reduction in gross margin ceilingswhich the Government imposed in Hay 197^ should be revoked.   TheGovernment do not consider that either of these major changes couldbe justified at the present time.   Where individual distributors
have escaped a disproportionate rise in costs and the general depression of demand, the present control remains an important safe-guard for the consumer against unnecessarily high margins.   Fordistributors whose net profit margins have been eroded, there aresafeguard provisions designed to mitigate the impact of the controland to enable the erosion of margins to be checked, insofar as themarket permits.28.   Two of the general modifications discussed above will be ofbenefit to individual distributors who have experienced problems withthe present Code.   The stock relief (paragraph 13 above) will ease the problems of certain trades which under the existing Code havehad difficulty in financing the higher costs of replacing their stockout of their permitted margins.   The extension of the investmentrelief to cover expenditure on new shop buildings (paragraph 3 above)means that the relief, at the new higher rate of 35%, will cover alarger proportion of distributors&apos; capital expenditure than it doesnow.29- In addition, five changes are proposed in the rules which applyspecifically to distributors:a)    There will be improvement to the safeguard inparagraph 88 of the present Code which allowsdistributors a limited amount of scope to widengroaa margins if their net profit margins have beeneroded.   Distributors are at present allowed toraise gross percentage margins up to 105% of their original ceilings if net profit margins are below80% of reference levels;    it is now proposed thatthey should be able to widen gross margins up to 110%of ceilings in order to reach 80% of their net profit
margin reference levels.Gross percentage margins are based on a single year of trading:    either a recent 12 month period beforethe controls began   in 1973.or, if an enterprise hasnot traded in such a period, a 12 month period endingnot later than 31 March 1974.   There is thus a majordifference in treatment between firms which were only just establishing their businesses in the base yearand may have been caught with a low gross marginceiling and firms which set up in business just afterthe base period and thus have no ceiling at all.   Itis now proposed to bring into control all firms whichhave at least two complete trading years before July1976.   For any firm which had only one full year oftrading or less by 30 April 1975, the gross margin willbe any accounting period of 12 months within their first two years of trading.Provision will be made for the modification of individual gross margin ceilings, on the same lines as that for net profit margin reference levels(paragraph 25).     This should be of particularrelevance to firms or trades which have run intodifficulties as a result of major changes in salesmix.
d) The exemption, limits for small firms from the 10%cut in gross margins will he raised, to take accountof inflation and in line with the similar changes inthe administrative requirements set out in paragraph45 below, from  250,000 annual sales for retailersand  500,000 for wholesalers to  575,000 for retailersand  750,000 for wholesalers.e) Gross margins, like net margins, will be monitoredover a rolling 12 month period.Safeguards30   The Price Code contains a variety of safeguards for firms makinglow profits, or for cases where the profitability of a particularactivity has been significantly eroded since price controls were introduced.51.   The basic safeguard, available to any firm in any sector, isto bethat whereby the detailed rules of the Code cease / applied altogetherwhere a firm&apos;s return on capital is below a specified figure (the&quot;relief for low profits&quot; in paragraph 77 of the present Code).   InDecember 1974, the figure in question was raised to 10%, based on the historic cost of assets, and the accounting changes discussed inparagraphs 7-14 will now afford some additional relief within that figure.   The safeguard figure serves a second purpose.   Where it ismore favourable than the profit margin reference level establishedby a firm&apos;s performance in the reference period, it may be used in substitution.   For this function, a figure nearer to the averageresults of the private sector would be more appropriate, and a newsafeguard of 12$$ is proposed.
32,   An alternative safeguard is expressed in terms of a marginon turnover (paragraph 78 of the present Code).   Where this marginacts as a substitute reference level the Government propose to raisethe minimum from 2% to 2 %.33-    The Price Code also recognises certain minimum levels of profiton individual products or product ranges.   It has been represented by certain sectors of industry that these provisions have failed to achieve their purpose,   it is pointed out that firms cannot operate at safeguard levels over any protracted period, in that margins will again be eroded by cost increases before prices can again be raised.Without re-modelling the structure of the present rules the Governmentare prepared to raise the safeguard figure to the point where a firmcan set prices at a level which secures for the product (or productrange) at the time of the price increase:i)     total costs plus a       profit margin;   orii)    a profit margin not less than 80% of the marginin the base period before the introduction of thePrice Code,34.   The proposed improvement in the safeguard for distributors is described in paragraph 29(a!) above.JJiterest35*   It has been represented that the Price Code, as it has stood since19731 can operate ae a disincentive to the raising of new equity capital.   This is because the cost of interest is one of the costs which may be reflected in prices.   The raising of finance through a new share issue, as opposed to borrowing, would therefore tend toreduce a firm&apos;s permitted price and profit margins.   The Government
accept that the Code as it stands has this bias, and that it is undesirable that the price control should discourage firms fromgoing to the market for funds needed for expansion or to pay offborrowings.   They accordingly propose that all interest payments and receipts should in future be left out of account in theapplication of the allowable cost and net margin rules.   Referencelevels will be adjusted by a factor which reflects the firm1sborrowings in the last complete year of account, so that the headroomwithin reference levels is unaffected by this change.    Interestwill continue to be taken into account in the applicationof safeguards where appropriate, and in the provisions as they affectbanks and financial institutions.36.    In some trades and professions (such as solicitors and estateagents) the taking of deposits from clients and the receipt ofinterest on such deposits can be regarded as part of the normaltrading activity of the firm.   The Code will make it clear that interest in such circumstances is to be taken into account.Nationalised Industries37.   For a number of years before November 1974 the prices of the nationalised insutries were restrained more severely than those ofthe private sector.   The Government then made some changes to thePrice Code to enable those industries which could to raise their prices and phase out the deficits which the Government were subsidisi&amp;SThe gas and electricity industries and the Post Office are now out ofdeficit and there is every reason to believe that the rate of futureprice increases will be markedly less than we have experienced overthe last 18 months.
38.   But the Government remains very conscious of the need to contain the prices of necessities which are of vital importance in the family budget.   Nationalised industry prices have on the wholeincreased at above the average rate of inflation in the last 18 months and the Government consider it important to maintain a close scrutinyover them.39.   The cost controls, amended as for the private sector to permithigher depreciation, will continue to apply to nationalised industriessubject to a maximum of 2% on turnover and 10% on net assets.   Whereindustries are in surplus Ministers will retain a power to cut backindustriesproposed price increases, although as a minimum these/will be allowedincreases sufficient to let them break even.   In considering whether to exercise their powers over proposed price increases, ministers will bear in mind both the interests of the consumer and the needsof financing each industry&apos;s investment programme.Other public sector charges40.   There will be no change in the position whereby the price commission monitor proposals made by the regional water authoritiesto ensure that the resulting charges do not exceed the financialceilings imposed under the Water Act 1973-   Trading services oflocal authorities will also remain within the Price Code, with theexception of charges for car parking.   Increases in car parkingcharges beyond Code iimits may be necessary in the interests of effective local traffic management.
Other proposals-1.   The Government1 s proposals include further changes to the Code,which are set out in more detail in Part II of this Document.Amongst the most significant of these are:a) Coastal freight will be removed from control, becausethe system of competitive tendering on which it operatesand its close relationship with international shipping have made price controls impracticable and unnecessary.b) The cut-off date before which cost increases do not qualify for retrospective recovery in prices will berolled forward from 1 November 1973 to 1 January 1975(paragraph 23 of the Code).c) Following the Price Commissions reports on the treat-ment of increases in indirect taxes on alcoholic drinkand tobacco, the present requirement to deduct these increases from sales in computing gross and net profit margins will be replaced by standard rates of deduction -15% of sales for alcoholic drink and 20% for tobacco.d) A new discretionary power will be added enabling theSecretary of State to authorise modifications to the Codefor particular enterprises where a merger or acquisitionwhich improves efficiency in the national interest isat risk because of the Code&apos;s restrictions on profitrecovery.
e)     The anomaly whereby hire purchase and conditional salesare treated differently from instalment credit and personal loans will be terminated.   In line with thepolicy which underlies the Consumer Credit Act 1974,interest charges in hire purchase and conditionalsales will be put on the same basis as interest on other personal credit ti^nsactions, which is not subject to price control.   Belated non-interest chargessuch as the option-to-purchase fee in hire purchasecontracts, will remain subject to price control.42.    It is intended that the new Price Code should come into operation on 1 August 1976.   Price increase notifications received by the price commission before that date will have to conform with the existingCode.   Increases justified under the cross-subsidy provisionsassociated with the Price Check Scheme (paragraphs 137-141 of the code) may be maintained for up to 6 months from the date of theincrease, after which the price increase entitlement will revert tothe product on which the cost increase had been incurred.Notification and information requirements43.   The requirement on large manufacturing and service firms togive advance notice of price increases, with full supporting data,to the Price Commission constitutes an administrative burden for the firms concerned.   On the other hand, the structure of pre-notiification is important both to enable the Commission to stopunjustified price rises before consumers begin to pay them and tomake the sanction in the Price Code against excessive pay settlementsa credible and effective deterrent.

An exemption from pre-notification Tor minor price increases isalso proposed.

However, many firms have only recently become pre-notifiers because they have been drawn into this category by the effects of inflation.

The Government therefore intend to raise the categorisationlimits to offset        the effects of inflation since 1973 and toreduce the burden of the controls on manufacturing firms.   the revised lower limits will be as follows:
