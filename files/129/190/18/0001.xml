DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 43 R1     &quot;COPY NO     0A2 July 1976CABINETECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1.        The Government ie being subjected to the demand by powerfulfinancial institutions for further cuts in public expenditure as a conditionof the international assistance which is vitally needed to underpin sterling.Such cuts would have their main effect in the year preceding an election,damaging the economy, harming our supporters and raising unemploymenteven further.2.        There are three questions which the Cabinet should discuss before a decision is reached -i.      Has the Government any alternative but to comply withthe demand?ii.      Ought the Government to wish to comply with it?iii.       Ought the Government to put forward other measures instead ?THE GOVERNMENT&apos;6 NEGOTIATING POSITION3.       An immediate decision to cut public expenditure is not the rightbasis on which to negotiate durable arrangements to settle the sterlingcrisis.   The Government has insufficient exchange reserves and credit to meet persistent runs on the Pound.   Even if the exchange rate ladefended (as it must be) there is a serious risk of continuing withdrawalsof the  7 billion balances held by foreigners at such a rate as to absorb the recently agreed $5 billion swap facilities within a few weeks or months.4.        To settle the issue once and for all will require not just anothertranche of credit, but a standing arrangement on &quot;recycling&quot; of any out-flow of sterling balances held by foreigners, together with a medium-termloan large enough to meet other flews.1
5.        Stabilisation of sterling is as much in the interests of other western governments as in ours.    But, as an immediate condition forlasting support, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other lendinginstitutions will certainly require an on-going commitment by theGovernment to agree its overall financial and monetary targets.   By itselfan immediate decision on expenditure cuts would therefore not be enough.6.        On the other hand a commitment to agree financial and monetarytargets need not involve expenditure cuts at aU.    It would be contraryto the Fund1 s articles and to normal banking practice for the international institutions to insist on determining the specific composition of tax andexpenditure measures by which such targets were to be achieved.7.        The Government will have plenty of freedom of manoeuvre if it proposes to agree financial targets under the well-established timetable for public expenditure and budget decisions.    This timetable is designedto allow decisions to be reached on the basis of the best information andforecasts with opportunity for proper assessment and discussion.   If theIMF and other banking institutions accept a commitment to agree financial policy on this basis, the Government will be in a relatively strong position because of its comprehensive command over the relevant considerations and evidence needed to substantiate them.    At a technicallevel the Treasury can certainly hold its own with the Fund on domesticfinancial and monetary policy.8.        It may conceivably be the case that in present circumstances theIMF and other Governments will insist on large expenditure cuts as acondition for assistance.    The Cabinet will certainly need to establishwhether this is the case, or whether an on-going commitment to agreefinancial and monetary targets with the IMF would be an acceptable, or indeed a preferred, alternative.THE MERITS OF FURTHER CUTS IN PUBLIC expenditure.        Assuming mat some freedom of choice remains the Cabinet must consider whether it accepts the case for further cuts in public expenditureon their own merits.    The argument put forward in their favour - that theyare necessary to ,make room1 for industrial recovery - is unconvincing.10.      At the end of last year the Government imposed a standstill on public expenditure in 1977-78 and 1978-79.   This means that the entire increasein resources in those years has already been made available for industry,the balance of payments and private consumption.   The Cabinet is now asked to accept that the resources provided by 4 - 5 per cent growth planned for these years will be insufficient.    We are asked to make damaging cutsin public investment, or in employment in public services, or in welfarebenefits to low-income families, in order to release resources on a stilllarger scale.2
11.       The only truth in the re sources argument is mat if the target of4-5 per cent growth is pushed ahead there will probably be shortages of capacity in specific industrial sectors.   Cuts in public expenditure wouldbe the worst possible way to deal with this problem because they wouldhave a selective and damaging impact entirely unrelated to the industrialbottlenecks which may emerge.   As far as possible, specific shortages of capacity should be dealt with directly and selectively.   If any generalrestraint on growth of demand Is required, tax increases will provide afairer, less discriminatory method of achieving it.THE ALTERNATIVE TO FURTHER CUTS IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE12.       The basic problem is how to carry through sustained economic expansion when industrial capacity is now so weak.   If the Governmentsucceeds in maintaining economic recovery, the growth of tax revenuesand priv&amp;te income will make expenditure cuts unnecessary.   But If itfails, whether because expansion peters out or because growth has to be checked on account of a rising trade deficit, further cuts In public expend!-ture might be unavoidable.13.       Therefore if the Cabinet decides against immediate cuts In public expenditure it will not be enough to proceed with the normal timetable for financial decisions without making other changes in economic policy.The Government must be prepared for the likelihood that shortages ofindustrial capacity will cause the trade deficit to widen as recoveryproceeds.   Three types of measure should be adopted as soon as possibleto deal with this eventuality.14.       First, the Government must strengthen its capacity to restrictinessential imports, both by preparing to introduce compulsory selectivemeasures and by negotiating import ceilings with major importers andforeign suppliers.   Such negotiations would be more effective if they couldbe linked to planning agreements in which the Government had someeffective bargaining counters (such as the power to release reserveinvestment funds).15.      Second, the Government should increase taxes on commodities whichare mainly or wholly imported.    Obvious examples are ail (which in someuses would be substituted by coal and gas) and tobacco and alcohol.Together these at present contribute nearly  2 billion less revenue relative to GNP than they did five years ago.16.       Third, the Government must adopt selective measures to inducemanufacturing companies to increase, their production and investment.Across-the-board concessions on corporate taxation and the price codehave not proved effective in this respect.   Future resources should be concentrated on a selective, bargaining approach through the national enterprise Board and planning agreements, backed up by an investmentreserve fund from which finance is released for agreed programmes.3
CONCLUSION17.       Rather than deciding now on an emergency package of cuts in public expenditure, the Government should seek lasting assistance from the IMFand other banking institutions subject to an on-going commitment to agreefinancial and monetary targets with the IMF according to the conventionaltimetable.   Ibis approach will give the Government a strong bargaining position.18.      Public expenditure cuts are not required on general resourcegrounds and would be the worst method for dealing with specific bottleneckswhich may arise.19. Instead, the Cabinet should as soon as possible adopt measuresto counter shortages of industrial capacity and the risk of a large tradedeficit which may otherwise prevent sustained economic recovery.A W BDepartment of Energy2 July 19764
