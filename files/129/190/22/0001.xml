DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT81CP(76) 47 COPY no July 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE AID programme memorandum by the Minister for Overseas development . The Chancellors paper proposes a cut of  100 million In the overseas aid programme for 1977-78.    I submit to my colleagues that thisis completely unacceptable for the following reasons:1. It is outrageously disproportionate to all the other savingshe is seeking.    He would be taking 10 per cent of hie savings froma programme which accounts for only 0.89 per cent of public expenditure.2 It would reduce our aid programme in 1977-78 by over18 per cent.    This could not be done by &quot;limiting new commitments1as suggested     tho-Annex to the Chief Secretary &quot;a memorandum.A cut of this size would mean reneging on a number of commitments and expected01&quot; Qf * bilateral, European and international character, and the political consequences of such an action wouldbe grave.    My officials are urgently studying which commitmentswe would have to go back on so as to minimise the damage, but Ican say already that we should have to take an implacably negative attitude in Brussels, even on favoured programmes such as aid to non-JVssociates, and in the international discussions on the follow upto the North-South dialogue and the United Nations Conference on trade and Development (UNCTAD); that bilateral capital aidpledged but not yet allocated to particular projects would in somecases have to be stopped; and that even on-going projects may beaffected, with adverse effects on the development plans of ourclients and on our relations with them.    It goes without saying,of course, that new commitments would have to be eliminatedhowever urgent the political case might be in the view of theForeign and Commonwealth Office or my Cabinet colleagues.    last october we published a White Paper (Cmnd 6270), announcing our policy of directing more aid to the poorest countries and the poorestgroups within them.   This was approved by the House of Commons ina debate in November and has been well received throughout the world.We could not pursue the strategy if our programme was substantiallycut,1
3,        The moral case for maintaining, and, as far as possible,increasing the aid programme is well understood by my colleagues.But in a year in which our national wealth is expected to increase by5 per cent the Chancellor is not merely suggesting mat we do notspend a penny of this addition to our wealth on aid but that we actuallyreduce the programme far below its present level.    I could not possibly explain this to public and Parliamentary opinion.   A richcountry ought not to be so mean and petty as to solve its problemsat the expense of poor countries, with the biggest loss beingsuffered by the world&apos;a poorest people, many of them living nearstarvation level.    Britain is a rich country.    There is a differencebetween being broke and being poor.    The fact that one has a mortgage on one&apos;s house does not prevent one from contributing tothe local church.4,        The international political consequences of a major aid cutwould be most damaging.    The political background includes the continuing &quot;North/South&quot; dialogue in the Conference on international economic Co-operation talks in Paris; and the follow up to UNCTAD,where our existing attitudes were condemned as negative.    we want the Commonwealth Prime ministers Conference next year -at which we shall be the hosts - to be a success.    If a swingeingcut in aid to the developing Commonwealth were just taking effect,the conference would get off to a very bad start.    The organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ministers agreed only a fortnight ago that increased concessional aid was required in particular for those developing countries most in need;and the communique continued: &quot;Member Governments agreed to intensify their efforts within the OECD to strengthen policies tothose ends&quot;.    We are already one of only four OECD countries whose aid performance was worse in 1975 than 1971.    Within theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) we devoted a smaller shareof our Gross National Product (GNP) to aid in 1975 than any of our partners except Italy, Ireland and Luxembourg.   And in terms of dollars per head of population our aid in 2975 represented $15, thatof Germany $27 and that of the Netherlands $45.   Do we really want to earn the reputation of being more mean and unreliable than other western nations?5.        There would be a violent reaction on the domestic politicalfront.    We have been the Party which has endorsed the United Nations0, 7 per cent of GNP target for aid in election manifestos and in conference resolutions.    Since we returned to office we havepublicly accepted the target as a Government and at very manyinternational conferences have undertaken to move towards it as our economic situation allows.    But in fact ever since 1961 our aidperformance has been declining, from 0.52 per cent in that year to0,38 per cent in 1975, and the decline has been faster under Labourthan under Conservative Governments (who indeed exempted the aid2
programme in major cutting exercises in 1970 and 1973).   As a percentage of public expenditure it has declined from 2 per cent in1961 to 0,89 per cent in 1975.    The Chancellor^ proposals would reduce both these figures still further in 1977.   A further moveaway from the 0. 7 per cent target at a time when our GNP was growing by as much as 5 per cent would cause an explosion of feeling in all parts of the Labour Party.    This would be reflected in anoutburst by all internationally-minded people - in the Churches, inorganisations such as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief(OXFAM) and the United Nations Association.   Any claim that theLabour Party represented Britain&apos;s &quot;international conscience1&apos;would be destroyed.6.        The economic consequences to us of cutting our aid programme would at best be neutral - probably harmful.   About70 per cent of our aid is spent in the United Kingdom on british goods and services; and aid helps to capture markets for futureUnited Kingdom commercial exports and so contributes to highergrowth and employment of the United Kingdom economy in the longer run.    Since aid cuts will fall disproportionately on the bilateral capital aid programme some markets could be lostcompletely.    This aid is almost entirely tied to the procurementof British goods and therefore cuts in aid would have the effect ofincreasing unemployment in this country at least as much as cutsin other programmes.    Nor can we expect to opt out of theinternational aid effort without possible consequences on the actions of other donord and in particular the Japanese, the Germans andthe Americans.    The value of the orders we get from theinternational aid effort is greater than the money we put into it.7.        As for our longer-term interests, the recent Cabinet Officepaper on Future World Trends emphasised the race betweenpopulation and resources which will condition the whole worldoutlook in coming years, and concluded: &quot;Unless there areresource transfers on a scale many times greater than at present,the effective check to world population will be the Malthusian trilogyof war, famine and disease&quot;.conclusion.        There appear to me to be three alternatives facing the Cabinet inrelation to the aid programme -a. To make a massive and disproportionate cut as recommendedby the Chancellor.b. To make a small cut, in proportion to the rest of the cuts,eg of 2\ per cent or so.c. To leave it alone.3
I submit that alternative a. is totally unacceptable for the reasons given above.   Alternative b. would still attract a large amount of adversereaction at home and abroad and would produce savings to the Chancellorso small as to be worthless.   We should adopt alternative c*    This is what we did a few months ago in relation to the last Public expenditure white Paper.    The reasons which were valid then are equally valid now.REPMinistry of Overseas Development9 July 19764
