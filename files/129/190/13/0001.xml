DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(76) 3829 June 1976COPY NO81CABINETDROUGHTMemorandum by the Minister for Planning and Local Government1.        The purpose of this paper is to seek my colleagues agreement toallocating Parliamentary time this Session for a short BUI designed to give us extra powers for dealing with drought emergencies.2.        The water situation is serious in the southern half of England and InSouth Wales,    This has arisen as the result of a series of dry summers,and in particular an unprecedently dry 12 months since spring 1975,    Theareas most at risk are parts of East Angiia, the East Midlands, the SouthWest and West, and South Wales,   Within these areas the effects are ofcourse highly localised, but it is now virtually certain that we shall faceshortages leading to inconvenience and some hardship in the course ofthe summer and autumn.   Over and above this, there is in some places a real risk of a breakdown os supplies calling for water rationing; there havebeen worrying indications over the last few days of a sharp and unexpecteddecline in the position,  particularly in Northamptonshire, reflecting thefact that we simply do not have experience of factors that may apply whengroundwater is as low as it is at the moment.3.        My Department, together with the other Departments involved,have kept in close touch with developments through the special machinerywith the Water Authorities that we established in the spring.   This jointexamination and contingency planning focused our attention on the questionof the availability of legal powers.    The Water Authorities confirmed ourpreliminary conclusion that existing powers were not adequate to deal withthe localised emergency situations that we might be facing and urged us toput the matter right very quickly.4.        I have no doubt that these extra powers are essential.     They wouldtake the form of a widening of the Secretary of Stated powers to makeDrought Orders under the Water Act 1958 so as to provide, a, means of stopping non-essential uses of water in the build-up period when public support for water economy campaigns is essential, and, b. a legal frame-work for a water rationing system for Industry, agriculture and domesticuse that does not depend, as under existing powers it would have to, on the1
prerequisite of e&amp;taxing for domestic supply by standplpes.    I havecirculated to the Home Affairs Committee a paper setting out the proposals in detail, and they are summarised in the annex; but there is an overridingquestion of the timing of legislation.S,        The Bill I have in mind would be some five clauses long, and couldbe ready for Introduction in about a week.    But it would have at this stage tobe taken on the Floor of the House and would as I understand it have todisplace other measures now before Parliament.6.        I have discussed this with the Lord President of the Council.    I agree with Mm that the choice is difficult: our legislative programme isfull enough without an extra Bill, however short and non-controversial, atthis stage of the Session.    It is, I think, a matter for the Cabinetcollectively.   I cannot prove that the extra powers I have suggested arecrucial now rather than in November, since I cannot predict how far and how fast the situation may decline over the next few months.    I can only saythat the indications now are that in the continued absence of substantialrainfall we may face unexpectedly rapid changes in the water supply position, and I am satisfied that delay In taking adequate powers could lead to major embarrassment and criticism.conclusion,        I am satisfied that the water shortage we are facing presents ue witha potentially dangerous situation for which our existing powers are inadequate and I ask agreement to urgent action to safeguard the position by the immediate introduction of a short amending Bill.JSDepartment of the Environment29 June 19762
confidential.     The powers currently available are the following:-i Water Authorities can under existing powers imposebans on the use of hosepipes for domestic purposes and this a number of Authorities have already done.ii A S.1 Drought Order under the Water Act 1958 allowsWAs to take water not otherwise available to themand suspends or modifies restrictions or obligationson the talcing of water, including compensation water and its treatment.   This is a valuable power but very limited.   The provisions provide for the payment ofcompensation to those adversely affected.iii A S.2 Drought Order under the 1958 Act enables water authorities to suspend or modify any enactment or agreement so far as it relates to failure to makenormal supplies of water available without compensation.But these powers are subject to two major limitations:they operate only in areas where standpipes are alreadyoperating for domestic supply and they relate only to water supplied by the water undertaker.  .Even in an extremely serious situation there would be many measureswhich could be desirable or necessary before standpipeshave to be erected for domestic supply or outside theactual areas in which standpipes were operative.iv The Emergency Powers Act gives a wide range of powers.But there are many difficulties Including the proclamation of a State of Emergency.2.&quot;   The basic defects of the existing powers are that they donot allow for a graduated series of measures for restrainingnon-essential uses of water progressively as a drought situationdevelops, and they do not provide hard enough powers for what could be a localised 1 emergency&apos; situation in the full sense ofthe word.CONFIDENTIAL
5.     The necessary powers would be sought by amendment of theWater Act 1953.4.     The two classes of Drought Order described above as S.1 ^S.2 would be retained, but on a gradated basis.   The SectionalDrought Order would be for use in the run-up to an emergency-The 0rde3: powers would be substantially- widened to give the VAswide discretion to limit or modify any enactment, agreement o-implied agreement, for the supply ofa. -   unraetered water;b. raetered water;c. abstractions;d. discharges,and would enable them also to authorise other people temporarilyto abstract or discharge without going through the elaborateprocedures of the 1963 Water Resources Act.   Compensation would-be payable in these circumstances, as it is under S.1 DroughtOrders at the moment.   The main purpose would be to strengthen   .the Water Authorities&apos; ability to secure the limitation of non-essential water uses as a precautionary measure and as anadjunctto their general economy campaigns.5.     The Section 2 Drought Order would be for a localisedemergency situation.   It would give essentially the powers of limitation of use set out in Section 1, but without compensate0&quot;and against tighter criteria of urgency and need.   It would 6ive -the power to ration water, in a far more flexible manner thatthe present legislation, with the link to standpipes, provides.The&quot;powers of the Secretary of State to grant such orders wouldhave to be curtailed to an initial period of two or three mofltllS*with limited provision for renewal.6.     Orders under the 1958 Act as it stands are made by theSecretary of State, subject to a - limited - period for objectionand also public inquiry.   These safeguards would be retained-a9 B\ ,
