Document is the property of her britannic majesty &quot;S governmentCF(76) 30 COPY NO     g J8 June 1976CABINETUNITED KINGDOM PRESIDENCY OF THE e.c., JANUARY-JUNE 1977Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affaire1.        Following the normal rotation of the Presidency between the member states of the Community the United Kingdom will take the chair from january to June 1977 and the success of our first Presidency will be important for us and for our standing In the Community,    Tenure of the presidency can provide an opportunity for initiatives on matters of policy but, for the most part, the test of a successful Presidency is whetherCommunity business is carried forward rapidly and effectively.   ensuring that we achieve the necessary satisfactory performance will place aconsiderable additional workload on Ministers and officials, and will nodoubt also raise Parliamentary pairing problems.   I think it is important that we should all be aware of the practical requirements,   I attach at annex A a paper by officials, which was discussed by the ministerial committee on European Questions (COM) on 27 May.2,        It is customary for each Presidency to put forward six months inadvance provisional dates for the main Council of Ministers meetings(Foreign Affairs, Finance and Agriculture).   CQM agreed that we should propose for these meetings the dates listed In the attached Annex B and,additionally, dates for Energy and Development Council meetings.   Headsof Government have already agreed to a European Council in London on28/29 June,3.        For Foreign Ministers there may be two meetings to discuss matters of political co-operation and perhaps an informal weekend meeting.The Secretary of State for Energy hopes to make a major effort on theCommon Energy Policy during our Presidency.   So, in addition to twoEnergy Councils, he is considering an Informal weekend for EnergyMinisters, possibly in Scotland.   The Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food proposes to hold an Informal meeting of Ministers of Agriculture,and the Special Committee on Agriculture, in London on 24/26 May.1
4.        In the interests of economy and efficiency, CQM also agreed thatwhenever possible the facilities In the new Lancaster House complex willbe used for Ministerial and other important European Economic Communitymeetings in London.    So that planning for our Presidency can proceed in an orderly fashion, any further proposals for Council meetings  a Brussels orLuxembourg or informal meetings in the United Kingdom should be putforward as soon as possible.A foreign and Commonwealth Office8 June 1976Z
IIK PRESIDENCY OP THE BBC, JANUARY - JUNE 1977:MINISTERIAL BURDENS AND MAIN ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTSNote by the Foreign and Commonwealth office i general.     The purpose of this paper ie to tanarlia the duties ofthe Preeidency, to set out the preparations needed In 1976,and to seek ministerial views on matters which require early decisions of principle.2.    British tenure of the Presidency in the first half of1977 will impose considerable responsibilities, during aperiod which will also see the Queen&apos;s Jubilee, a CommonwealthHeads of Government nesting, and a NATO ministerial meeting,all in London.   The Presidency chairs and manages all Counciland Political Cooperation business during Its term of office,and although there are slight variations in national style,member states look to the Presidency for fairneee and efficiency in the despatch of the Community&apos;s business rather than foreye-catching initiatives - although these need not he precludedwhere they visibly serve a clear Community interest.   In a community where chairmanship passes in rotation, everyonemeasures with a practised eye the efficiency and impartialityof each term of of floe.   The activities of the Community haveincreased markedly over the past three years; this has addedto the burdens of the Presidency, not least in terms of minister-erial commitment, and may continue to do so during 1976,Existing practice may thus have been overtaken to some extent by January 1977, hut the sain components of the Presidency&apos;stssk at present are:/A.
ftt     co&quot;n&quot;*l BusinessI. fo chair Co-unity westings at all levels.   Administratively,this weans that for most If not all Meetings, at least two British representatives must attend.   At the moreimportant Councils, this Bay require two Ministers, one in the chair ana the other as national representative.Politically, there ie the Chairman&apos;s responsibility for preparation of meetings (particularly in selection andordering of the agenda)t and for finding constructivecompromise.   Continuity in the chair will be essential.II. To act as host for Co-unity functions in the country ofthe Presidencyill. To represent the Council In frha European Assembly.Recent practice has tended increasingly towards theForeign Minister of each Presidency attending twocolloquies with the Political Committee of the Assembly,and replying to questions at the Assembly&apos;s monthlyplenary sessions.   This precedent for virtually 100 percent ministerial attendance, at least by Foreign Ministers,Is likely to have been strengthened by our Luxembourg and dutch predecessors.   It will be well received if thePrime Minister and other Ministers also attend; this neednot ba very demanding in terms of Ministerial time, sinceonly one-day or even half-day appearances would be involved.The Minister of Agriculture at any rate will be expectedto brief the Assembly on the 1977/8 price fixing in the cap.iv.   To lead for the Community at iwvmmminriw numerousassociation Councils! these Include twice-yearly meetings with the Turks and Greeks (le one each Presidency); inprinciple these are held alternately in Brussels and Athena/Ankara, so one or both such meetings during our term may be/&quot;away&quot;
&quot;away&quot; functions.   There will also, quite possibly, benestings with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Cyprus, malta and Israel.   There will be a risk of hurt feelings ifthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary is unable to chairall these functions,v.     The Qroek accession negotiations will probably be underway, and will add to the Presidencyfs task,   (unlike otherCommunity negotiations with third countries, accessionnegotiations come under the overall responsibility of the presidency rather than the Commission.)Ti.   To act as spokesman for the Community at Internationalmeet Inge, sharing the responsibility with the commission as appropriate.   This is an unquantlf lable corns it sentwhich could be made onerous by development of the CIBCand the North-South dialogue generally,ril. To represent the Nino where agreed by them in dlnlomstlcrelations with third countries, and to take the lead in local coordination of diplomatic efforts in capitals, in brussels, or in third countries.B.     European Political Cooperation3*     European Political Cooperation Is the name glren to the effort by the Nine member states to coordinate and to take commonpositions In the field of foreign policy outside the treaty frame-work.   In this area the country holding the Presidency is res-ponslble both for the management of business and for the provisionof Secretariat facilities.   Except for technical assistance(eg provision of etaultaneous interpretation at ministerial levelmeetings) the Council Secretariat is not involved.4.     There are up to two ministerial level political cooperationmeetings per Presidency; ours will very probably be held inLondon.   The Foreign Secretary will DO in the Chair and will/also
alao Bpeak for the UK (there is no 1 national delegate1 Inaddition, decisions being by consensus).     Supported by officials from the PCO, he will be responsible for theexecution of decisions taken within the political cooperationframework (the sending of instructions to posts abroad, speak-ing on behalf of the Nine in bilateral contacts with foreign government or leading sometimes in person the coordinationof diplomatic activity by the Nine in International organis-ations and conferences).C.     General Coordination5.     Finally, it la the responsibility of the Presidency generally to coordinate the activities of the Community and politicalcooperation; to ensure that ministerial decisions are prepared and executed by the appropriate machinery; to time ministerialmeetings and Councils in relation to each other and to thedecisions to be taken, and so on.II SUPPORT FOR THB PRESIDENCY6.     In addition to its own appropriately reinforced officialservices, the Presidency can count on support in itB taskfrom:i. The secretariat of the Council of Ministers.   The CouncilSecretariat, as a permanent career body, is in a positionto provide an invaluable element of impartial continuityfor chairmen at all levels, and also provides all thesecretarial, translation and interpretation facilities required for Community meetings.ii. The Commission.   Although the Commission Is of courseautonomous and in no sense the servant of the Councilof Ministers, it shares the main aim of the Presidency,viz to effect the Community^ business in a constructiveway.   New Commissioners will be taking office on1 January 1977 as we begin our Presidency, almost certainlywith a British President of the Commission, Ttnd althoughmost Commission officials will not change, It will he/important
important for us to get quickly alongside the newCommissioners themselves.7. Deaplte these aids, the Presidency Is recognised as a heavyadministrative burden.   A Presidency Unit is being set up inthe TCo to&quot; assess the call on our resources, and to liaise withother Whitehall Departments over how it can aoet effectivelybe set.Ill     ALLOCATION OP RESPONSIBILITIESA    Ministerial8.   The Prise Minister will chair the European Council, whichwill Beet in Brussels (or Luxembourg) early in 1977* and inLondon on 28/29 June.   Throughout the six months he will speakfor the Community at Heads of Government level as appropriate(though the Community looks to Heads of Government to providegeneral guidance rather than day to day decisions).   The PrimeIflnieter has no obligation to appear before the European Assembly,but there are precedents, and it would be well received if he decided to address them, at least once during our Presidency.9&apos;     The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs has perhaps the heaviest task in terms of Council business, with monthlyCouncils to which Bust be added up to two Political Cooperationaeetings at Binisterial level in this country, one (possible)&quot;Schloes Gymnich* type of informal weekend gathering of foreign ministers, and the principal responsibility for answering theAssembly^ questions at plenary sessions, and briefing it at two fcolloquiesf under Political Cooperation arrangements.(The Assembly duties are unlikely to involve anything norethan  one day visits.)   He attends the European Council insupport of the Prime Minister and bears with his Communitycolleagues some degree of responsibility for harmonising thework of specialist Councils.   Although in the first half of/the
the year there will he no UN General Assembly to plan for, aparticular task for the period may be the CIEC MinisterialConference (which looks increasingly likely to slip from 1976).and the preparations for resumption of the work of the CSCE atthe Belgrade meeting arranged for June 1977.   At Foreign AffairsCouncils It will be necessary to have a second Minister in atten-dance as &apos;national representative&apos;.10.     Other Ministers&apos; responsibilities will vary.   For theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture, theywill clearly be heavy, with the latter responsible in the period for some seven or eight Councils including three or four &quot;pricefixing&quot; Councils.   A list of proposed dates for these and ForeignAffairs Councils is at Annex B. The sooner Ministers can decide what other Councils will be necessary within their respectivefields, the better.   At most Councils, including those listed,it will probably be necessary to have a national representativeas well as the Chairman in each case.   This is a burden which willhave to be taken into account at an early stage.   But in all cases it will be Important that for each subject Council (eg Research)one Minister should be designated well ahead of the Presidency as responsible for chairing and supervising the work In his field.Since preparation of the Council frequently continues almost untilthe eve of the Council itself, Ministers in previous Presidencieshave found it essential to arrive in Brussels or Luxembourg wellIn advance of their Council - usually the evening before if themeeting begins in the morning - to allow adequate time forbriefing by their Permanent Representative, and the CouncilSecretariat.   This then allows time for lobbying of colleagues orother follow-up before the meeting begins.   Continuity will be essential; this raises parliamentary pairing problems which ministers may wish to note.B.     Departmental Administration11.     The normal financial rules, including those applying to allied services, will apply to departmental expenditure arisingfrom the Presidency, in the UK and overseas.   The Treasury have said that Departments will be required to meet such expenditure within their existing PESO allocations.   The Presidency means anincreased workload for the Departments principally concerned/and
and for UKREP in Brussels, and has Implications for staffing,training, finance and general administration at official level.Por example, since there la no permanent career secretariat for political Cooperation, the Presidency takes total responsibilityfor the management of Political Cooperation.IV     CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE UK12.     During our Presidency, the facilities in the new LancasterHouse complex will be available for ministerial and certain other important e.c. meetings.   These facilities should be bothefficiant and imposing, and it is clearly right In principlethat full use should be made of them.*3.     Recent Presidencies have, however, held certain moreinformal ministerial level meetings outside the Presidency capital:the *8chloss Oymnioh&apos; occasions, for example, and informalmeetings of agriculture and other Ministers.   Am regards location,there is a feeling in the Community that a single efficientconference centre in the capital of the Presidency ia to hepreferred to more nomadic arrangements; (on the other hand, itmight cause ill feeling outside England If the Presidency passedwithout any meeting north or west of the border.)   A ministerialdecision of principle would he helpful at an early stage.V     TIMETABLE FOR PREPARATIONS14.     to achieve the professionalism which the Community ha acome to expect from the Presidency means sound advance preparation;once begun the work of the Presidency is continuous.   On pastform there should ha aome 50/60 meetings in the United Kingdom,of whioh the moat Important would be the European Council; twoor three meetings of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and, typic-ally, up to half a dozen informal meetings of other Minis tore.Among meetings to he held in Brussels or Luxembourg, we shallhave to propose a date for the first European Council of ourPresidency; we should have do this at the same time as wecirculate the proposed list of main (le Foreign Affairs, finance and Agriculture) council a, in June 1976.   Thereafter it will/still
still be possible to add further CouncilB or other, informal,meetings of Ministers a a the programme of our Dutch pred-eceesors becomes clearer, though experience shows that diariesfill up early on and agreement on new dates becomes progressively more difficult.   Papers arising out of further work by officialswill be brought to Ministers as necessary, and detailed planningpapers on tactics and overall objectives will be brought forward for ministerial discussion e arly in the Autumn.FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICEli May 1976
