DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY4 government cp(76) 44 COPY NO      29S July 1976CABINETTHE TOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY REPORT NO 8, ministers and MPe, PART nMemorandum by the Lord President ef the council. The Top Salaries Review Body delivered Part H of its report to thePrime Minister on 14 June 1976 in response to his invitation in January 1975to review the pay, allowances and pensions of Ministers and MPs andPeers1 expenses allowance.2.        The Review Body submitted Part I of its report confined to Members1pay and allowances on 13 June last year.   This Part II report (copyattached) deals with Members1 pensions, Ministerial aalaries and somemiscellaneous matters concerning Members1 allowances and facilities.   APart m report dealing with peers expenses allowance is expected shortly.3.        The recommendations in the report are summarised atAppendices A-C.    The main ones are as follows :-A. Members Allowances and Facilities (see Appendix A)Payment of a new allowance of  300 over a period of three years tocover office expenses; free travel anywhere in the United kingdom on Parliamentary business; free postage and telephone facilities to european Economic Community countries, severance payments should be only an alternative to redundancy payments.B. Members1 Pensions (see Appendix B)The maximum reckonable service prior to October 1964 to beincreased from 10 to 15 years; interest on refunded contributions tobe increased from 3 to 4 per cent; provision for purchase of addedyears; provision for retirement on grounds of ill health; improve -ments in widows&apos; and dependants1 pensions; an early retirementoption at 62 for Members with 25 years&apos; service; contribution rate to be increased from 5 to 6 per cent.1
C.        Ministerial Salaries (see Appendix C)ministers salaries were last increased as from 1 April 1972 and the review Body hava nov recommended improved rates brought up todate as at June 1975.    The existing structure of rates Is retained.The Prime Minister&apos;s salary would go up by  5,000 to  25,000,which together with his recommended Parliamentary salary of 5,000, would give total emoluments of  30,000.    The lord chancellor&apos;s Balary of  20, 000 would go up to  27, 000.    salaries for other Cabinet Ministers would go up by  5, 000.    Increases for ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries would be  3,500and  3,000 respectively.    Increases for Office Holders are rather less, ranging from  4, 500 for the Leader of the Opposition in the commons to  2, 000 for Whips in the Commons and  1, 500 for theOpposition Chief Whip in the Lords.    Full details are set out InAppendix C.4.        Approval by the House of the Governments proposal, which I amshortly due to announce, to Increase Members&apos; salaries by  6 a week asfrom 13 June 1976, subject to earnings from all sources not exceeding 8, 500, will effectively rule out any action on the recommendations forMembers1 allowances and pensions at this present time.    Improvements in non--wage benefits, including improvements in pension terms, have to be set against the  6 limit, and against the  4 limit under the next stage.     Thismeans that new reimbursement allowances and improvements in allowances,other than those attributable to increased costs, must equally reckon againstthe pay limits.5,        The implementation of the increases recommended In ministerial salaries is ruled out by the current pay limits.    The recommendationscannot rank as a pre-policy commitment as their publication does not pre-date the pay policy;   to that extent their standing under the policy is different from the recommendations in respect of Nationalised Boardsalaries which were published In December 1974.    Under the next round,their Parliamentary, rather than their Ministerial, salary would command the first call on any  4 a week Increase for Ministers.    However, any decisions on changes in Ministerial pay in the next round can only be takenin the light of decisions on higher pay policy generally and other outstandingpublic sector higher salary problems.6.        Although enabling powers are being sought in the Parliamentary andOther Pensions and Salaries Bill now before Parliament to allowMinisterial pensions to be based on their proper rate rather than theiractual rate, action equally cannot be taken to accept and promulgate the recommended Ministerial salaries for pension purposes as they were not putforward and accepted prior to the introduction of the policy as was the case for the rate of  8, 000 recommended for MPs.2
7.        Some of the recommendations listed under Appendices A and B donot in any event call for action at the present time as the Review Body havemerely found against certain possibilities such as improving the accrualrate for MPa1 pensions and increasing the secretarial allowance speciallyto provide for occupational pensions for secretaries.recommendation.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that the report should be printed and presented to Parliament in, say, 14 days&apos; time and that I should make covering statement to the effect that while we have considered its contentswe shall not wish to take any further action on the report until incomes policy permits.M FPrivy Council office July 19163

MINISTERS CF THE CROWN AND MEMEERS OP PARLIAMENT AND THE peers EXPEJBES ALLOWANCE:PART IICHAPTER i: introduction the background.   We were invited by the Prime Minister on 15 January 1975 to review the reraunera-tion and pensions of Ministers of the Crown and Members of Parliament, and the Peers1expenses allowance.   Initially we intended to submit our recommendations in asingle report but, in view of the extent to which a real financial burden hadalready fallen on many Members, we decided to deal first with those remunerationproblems that we saw as meriting urgent action.    Consequently, the first part ofour report on this remit, submitted in June 1975 and published in July 1975^,dealt with the salary of Members, the Parliamentary salary of Ministers and paidoffice holders, and with the main allowances and facilities.   At that time, itwas our intention to complete the remainder of our remit in a Becond report.   Bitas this is the first occasion on which we have reviewed the working of the Peers1expenses allowance, and as that part of our task raises issues that are different in kind from the rest, we have decided to put forward our conclusions and recommenda-tions on the Peers&apos; expenses allowanoe separately.   We will do so shortly.   Inthis report, therefore, we deal with three items: first, oertain matters related to Members&apos; allowances and facilities which were held over from Report No 7 forfurther consideration) second, the Parliamentary pension scheme; and finally, the pay and pensions of Ministers and other paid office holders in both Houses ofParliament.2.   In our Report No 7, we recommended that the pay of Members of parliament should be increased to  8,000, to bring it up to date since the last review in 1971and to allow for some necessary revaluation of the job; that the Parliamentary salary of Ministers and paid offioe holders who are Members of the House of commons should be increased to  5,000; and that in future salaries should be subject tobiennial review.   We also recommended that the maximum of the secretarialallowance should be increased to  3,200 a year to provide opportunity for thewployment of a full-time secretary where neoessary, and that it should beavailable to provide either secretarial or research assistance or a combination of both; that the additional costs allowanoe, which helps to defray the cost ofliving away from home when engaged in Parliamentary duties, should be increased1 .Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No 7: Ministers of the Crown and Members ofParliament and the Peers&apos; expenses allowanoe: Part I - cmnd.. 6136, July 1975.1
to a maximum of  1,350 a year; that the London supplement, payable to ministers and paid, office holders and to Members whose constituencieB are within theGreater London Council area, should be increased to  340 a year; that the carmileage allowance should be increased to 10.2p per mile; and that the maximum number of vouchers available to wives or husbands of Members for travel betweenWestminster and the constituency or Westminster and home should be increased from 10 to 15 a year.   We also recommended that, in future, the maximum of theadditional costs allowance, the London supplement and the car mileage allowance should be adjusted automatically in line with changes in relevant civil servicerates.   In accordance with this reoommendation, the maximum of the additionalcosts allowance has now been increased to  1,814 and the London supplement to 385 (both with effeot from 1 July 1975)-3.   In putting forward our recommendations, we made olear that we attached thehighest &quot;importance to their early and full implementation.   They were consideredby the Government and discussed in the House of Commons.   Those that affectedallowances and facilities were implemented in full, but the revised salary for members was restricted to  5,750 against  8,000 recommended, providing an increaseof  1,250 over the previous rate of  4,500; the Government proposed, however, andthe House of Commons accepted, that Members&apos; pensions should be based on ourrecommended figure of  8,000 and this deoision is in course of being put intoeffect.   The Parliamentary salary has been increased to  3,700 against  5f000recommended, an increase of  700 over the previous rate of  3,000; cabinet ministers, however, did not aooept the inorease (it had already been announcedthat they would accept no increase before 1 January 197^) and they continue toreceive the  3,000 level that was appropriate in 1972.4*   Our recommendations were designed as a coherent package.   We understand thedifficulties that arise when Members of Parliament are seen to give themselvessubstantial increases in pay, especially in times such as the present.   But we feel bound to express our concern at the consequences of continuing to undervaluethe demands on those eleoted to govern the country.   In particular we are perturbedthat, whereas our recommendations for increased allowances have been acoepted infull, Members&apos; salaries have been inoreased by little more than one-third of what we recommended.   We consider this imbalance between salaries and allowances tohe wrong in principle and unwise in practice.   We are also perturbed by theestablishment of two different levels of balary for pension purposes and other2
purposes.   We can sympathise with the reasoning which lay behind this deoision,but we nevertheless regard it as anomalous.   The only way to avoid these andother difficulties, awkward though it may be, is for Members to vote themselves a realistic salary.   If they fail to do so, as they did in 1975 when wagesand salaries in the community generally had risen rapidly between 1971 and 1974,they only store up greater difficulties for their successors in the future.5.   We note that, in the Debate^ whioh followed publication of our recommendations,Memoers accepted it as desirable in principle that a permanent link should be created between their pay and a point on the salary scale of the AssistantSeoretary grade in the oivil servioe, the minimum of which is higher than the salary which we recommended.   We were aware from the evidence submitted to us inthe course of the current review that Borne Members felt strongly on this point.We said in our first review of Members&apos; pay in 1971 &quot;that we did not Bee this as an appropriate solution to the problems and for our part we do not see it as appropriate now.   In our view, the level of remuneration for Members of parliament should continue to be judged on the demands of the job itself and against all thafactors relevant to it: Members ought not to be insulated from theBe factors (or,indeed, from public discussion of their pay) by a link with negotiated pay in atotally different employment situation.   We oontinue to regard the frequency ofreview as the key to this problem.The implications of the current pay restraint measures6.   The recommendations in this report have been put forward, of course, againstthe continuing background of the pay restraint measures that were outlined inthe White Paper &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd. 6151, July 1975)*   The white paper indicated (paragraph 13) that the three independent Review Bodies would beasked to ensure that any recommendations put forward during the period of operation of the restraint measures (whioh are due to expire at the end of next month) comply with the requirements of the policy.   These requirementsprovide that increases in remuneration are to be restricted on an individualbasis to a maximum of  6 a week; that a 12 month interval between major pay increases continues to apply; and that no increase at all may be paid during the currency of the restraint measures to those whose total earnings from all sources exceed  8,500 a year.7.   The issues with which we are oonoerned in our ourrent remit do not fitconveniently into the oiroumstanoes for whioh the pay restraint measures were1 House of Commons Hansard, Volume 896, No 165, 22 July 1975*
directly designed.   Nevertheless, it is clear &quot;that those measures apply to the outstanding matters in our review of Parliamentary remuneration (including thePeers1 expenses allowance, on which we will be putting forward separaterecommendations) notwithstanding the fact fheet all of them are part of anoveraU review which was begun (and partly completed) before the measures were introduced, and that the salaries with which wt are concerned here have remained unchanged since 1 April 1972*   The detailed iamlioations for the eapeate of ourremit dealt with in this report are described in the note that follow this chapter.   The current measures expire shortly and new ones will take their place.He have taken the view that, although the greater part of the recommendations that we now sutmit cannot be implemented immediately, it is right to put thenforward in order to complete a further part of the review that we began in early1975 hut had not completed when the ourrent measures were introduced.   Furthermore,it will make it possible for future reviews of Parliamentary remuneration to startfrom a common point of reference.   Cur present recommendations represent the levels of remuneration which would have been appropriate at 13 June 1975 (&quot;thetime of our earlier recommendations).Our inquiriesS.   He have referred already, in our Report No 7, to the questionnaire whichwe sent to each Member of Parliament designed to secure information and viewson matters related both to salary and to allowances; the response rate was 70per cent.   A summary of the results of the survey is in Appendix A.9.   He are grateful to all those who have made themselves available for discussions with us in the course of our inquiries and to the many people from whom we havereoeived written evidence.   A liBt of the individual Members of Parliament,Ministers, offioe holders and others who gave oral evidenoe is in Appendix B.4
IMPLICATIONS OP THE CURRENT PAT RESTRAINT MEASURES FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS(Note to Chapter 1)a. Ministers and paid offioe holders:   any increase under the current measureshas to he restricted to a maximum of C  a week and can be paid only to those whose total earnings (including the increase) would not exoeed  8,500 a year.Total earnings for Ministers and offioe holders who are Members of the House ofCommons include the current Parliamentary salary of  3,700 ( 3,000 for cabinet ministers) and the London supplement of  385-   Consequently, all Ministers inthe House of Commons ourrently reoeive more than  6,500 and none is entitled toan increase at present.   Of the paid office holders in the House of Commons, only those currently paid  4,000 a year (some Government and Opposition Whips) areeligible for any increase: the maximum permissible inorease of  6 a week oould bepaid under the present measures following the completion of 12 months from the effective date (13 June 1975) of the inorease in the Parliamentary salary whiohresulted from the restricted implementation of our earlier recommendations.Ministers and office holders in the House of Lords are not eligible for theParliamentary salary but reoeive the London supplement of  385 and are now entitledto claim against the Peers&apos; expenses allowanoe up to a maximum of  700 a year (thefirst  100 of which is free of taxation).   Both of these amounts have to beaggregated with the salary attributable to the offioe to determine total earnings.Parliamentary Secretaries and Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State, the Chief,Deputy Chief and other Government Whips, the Leader of the Opposition and theOpposition Chief Whip, the Chairman of Committees and the Prinoipal Deputy Chairmanof Committees axe eligible for an inorease under the present measures, and themaximum increase could be paid in eaoh oase following the completion of 12 months from the effective date (13 June 1975) of the introduction of limited entitlement to claim against the peers expenses allowance.b. Allowances for Members of Parliament: increases in allowances are subject tothe current pay restraint measures, even where they are designed to reimburseactual expenditure within a maximum.   The rates (or maxima) of such allowanoee canbe increased without having to count against the  6 a week pay limit, providedthat the inoreases reflect no more than movements in relevant costs.   But wherethe scope of an allowanoe (inoluding its coverage) is extended, the value of theincrease has to be counted against the pay limits in the same way as any newallowance that may be introduced.   Thus, the ohanges recommended in oertain ofthe allowances and facilities oould be implemented only following the expiry of12 months from the effective date (13 June 1975) of the last inorease in Members&apos;remuneration.   Moreover, only those Members whose total earnings from all sourcesare less than  8,500 would be eligible for any inorease at all under the present arrangements.   Total Parliamentary earnings for backbench MPs will be the aggregate of actual salary ( 5,750), not the notional salary for pension purposes of  8,000,and the London supplement for those who reoeive it.o.   The Parliamentary pension scheme:   improved provisions in pension schemesgenerally come within the soope of the ourrent restraint measures.   Any additional cost to public funds arising from improvements in the Parliamentary pension scheme would be treated in the same way as an employees extra contribution and would becoated against the limit if implemented during the ourrency of the present measures.All the points related to the oaloulation of the  6,500 total earnings limit (theactual salary of  5,750 may still be used in this context, despite the Motional&apos;salary of  8,000 for pension purposes) and the 12 month interval principle would apply equally.5
CHAPTER 2: ALLOWANCES AND FACILITIES FOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT10.   We indicated in our earlier report that further consideration would be neededof a number of points related to the allowances and facilities that are availableto assist Members in meeting the costs incurred in the course of carrying outParliamentary duties.   These points include aspects of the secretarial allowance and of the additional costs allowance; travel facilities; postage and telephonecosts; and severance arrangements.11.   We have also given further consideration to the special problems of disabledMembers to which we drew attention in that report.   The improvements in the allowances and facilities which followed from our recommendations on that oocasionwill have eased some of their difficulties.   Any further improvements in this context would have to be related closely to particular disabilities and their special needs.   Consideration of these aspects of the problem is not appropriate to a general review of the total remuneration package, which is our remit; and wehave been advised that they can best be considered as and when necessary withinthe machinery of Parliament itself.Aspects of the secretarial allowance12.   The maximum of the secretarial allowanoe is now  3i200 a year followingimplementation of our previous recommendation, and is available to provide eithersecretarial or research assistance or a combination of both.   This maximum isintended to enable Members to employ a full-time secretary where necessary, and provides for the payment of a full-time salary which has regard to the ealarylevel of a Personal Secretary in the civil service who works in Central London.The maximum of the allowance also recognises the cost incurred by the Member asenployer in payment of national insurance contributions.   In recommending thenew maximum, we indicated that we would give further consideration to the implications of a provision for occupational pension arrangements, and to thetreatment of general offioe expenses.13.   Provision for occupational pension schemes is a major item in employmentCosts: if a suitable arrangement were to be inoluded within the framework ofthe secretarial allowanoe, an increase of some  500 in the maximum of theallowanoe might be neoesBary.   Provision for an item of this magnitude and importance has to be considered against the background of the widely varyingcircumstances in which MPb employ secretaries.   For example, acme MPs share the
services of a secretary; others have access to secretarial assistance in their othercapacities; and, although our inquiries have shown an increasing use of secretarialhelp, many Members need substantially less than full-time assistance.H.   Provision is already made within the maximum of the allowance for the presentand planned arrangements for State pensions, through the inclusion of an elementto cover the employer^ national insurance (including graduated pension) contributions.The present State scheme provides essentially for a flat rate of pension, but thenew scheme which will come into operation in April 1978 will lead to an earnings-delated pension.   A higher level of contribution will then be required of thes&amp;ployer, but the rate currently envisaged would not justify an inorease in thePresent maximum of the allowance; it contains an element of rounding which isEfficient to provide for the planned level of contribution.   The position might need*o be reviewed if a higher rate of contribution were introduced or if the salaryelement within the allowance maximum were to be increased.15.   Therefore, although we attach importance to the provision of adequate pensions^Wangements for Members&apos; secretaries, we do not consider that it would be appro-PHate at this stage to provide within the allowance for an occupational pension scheme in addition to State pension arrangements.   He regard the present maximum0f the allowance as the most that can be justified on the present basiB of non-JAccountability, and any further increase in the maximum to provide for improved^perannuation arrangements would have to be subject to some suitable accountingprocedure.   We have taken note of the viewB expressed by the Select Committee on assistance to Private Members in their First Report   and particularly their eoncern*bout the accountability for the public funds from whioh secretarial support for members is provided.   They said:&quot;We are all convinced that it is incumbent upon the House to set standards of accountability in the use of public funds that are above any possiblepublic criticism.   We think that arrangements whioh may have been sufficientwhen allowances were comparatively low will not be sufficient if the allowances are substantially increased.&quot;The Select Committee recommended optional arrangements under which either secretariescould be employed centrally by the House authorities or olaims could continue to^e made against the maximum of the secretarial allowance, and said:First Report from the Select Committee on Assistance to Private Members -house of Commons Paper 375, Session 1974-75.
f&quot;We believe that the same high standards of accountability necessarilyapply to claims for the secretarial allowance and that Members shouldspecify the names of those to whom they have made payment forsecretarial assistance.&quot;We share the Select Committee&apos;s concern about standards of accountability but,since the House has not yet considered the Select Committee*s report andrecommendations, we make no further observations at this stage.16.   We made clear in our earlier report that the recommended (now current) maximum of the secretarial allowanoe made no provision for the cost of general officeexpenses, which had been included within the maximum following our 1971 reoommenda-tions.   We were aware that expenditure of this kind was not necessarily confined to those Members who employ a secretary, and we decided to consider if a separateallowance were justified.   Most Members of Parliament have to maintain an officeto deal with correspondence from constituents and from other members of the public.The expenses associated with this part of an MP&apos;s work are an inesoapable part ofour Parliamentary system and can arise whether or not a Member employs his ownsecretary.   Some of the routine but potentially substantial office expenses arealready met: for example, postage and inland telephone calls from Westminster are provided free.   But at present expenditure on equipment such as typewriters ordictating machines has to be borne by individual Members from their own resources.These costs too oan be substantial, particularly on first entering the House.   Weconsider that a separate allowanoe should be made available to provide for this need which, as we have said, may arise independently of the employment of a secretary, and that a suitable maximum amount would be  300 during any period ofthree years.   Claims within the maximum of the allowanoe may inolude the cost ofmaintaining offioe equipment and may be made at any time during a three-year period,whether as a single claim or as a series of claims.   But we regard it as appropriate that claims against this allowance should be supported by evidence of expenditureon particular items of equipment or on itB maintenance.   We believe that this requirement will be acceptable to Members.Recommendation.   We recommend that a new allowance be introduced to assist with the initial and maintenance costs of general office equipment.   The maximum of the allowance should be  300 during any period of three years and reimbursement of claims should be conditional upon evidence of expenditure.8
CONFIDENTIALAspect b of the additional oosts allowanoe17.   The annual maximum of the allowance is derived from a formula that appliesappropriate rate of overnight subsistence allowance for four nights a week overthe average duration of the Parliamentary session.   He have considered whether theformula provides adequate recognition of the oooasional need for individual members to attend at Westminster on Parliamentary business during a recess.   He see two points as relevant.   First, the present basis of the allowance maximum, related asit is to a notional full-time attendance at Westminster during the average Parliamen-tary session, provides sufficient leeway for the great majority of Members to meetthe occasional need to attend there during a reoesaj and second, the arrangements*hich cover the travel costs incurred by Members are not restricted to the periodof a Parliamentary session.   Although we did not confine our 1971 recommendation for the introduction of a daily subsistence allowance to the periods when parliament in session, we consider that, against the background of the present arrangements,** is not necessary to inorease the maximum of the additional oosts allowance nowP** this account.   The current maximum of  1,814 a year is in line with the appropriate**te of overnight subsistence in the civil service, and was inoreased to that amount**th effect from 1 July 1975 on the basis recommended in our Report Ho 7.&amp;avel facilities1o&quot;*   Members&apos; travel oosts are at present reimbursed for journeys between Westminster,^o*e and constituency; within the constituency; and to oentral and local Qovenment***thorities concerned with the constituency area, but located outside the constituency^ndaries.   He understand, however, that the meeting of Members&apos; oosts for journeys to&apos;* from home is a taxable benefit and consequently Members have to pay tax on the valueof oar mileage allowance claimed for suoh journeys or, following the 1975 Finance Act, onthe value of travel warrants issued for them.   The response to our questionnaire^dicated a measure of support from Members for the provision of wider facilitiesft* defraying the oosts of travel.   Many of those who made proposals on this point*Dggested that all travel within the United Kingdom should qualify for the reimburse^***** of fares or for oar mileage allowanoe.   In our First report in 1971, we^oommended toe eatahliahmeKt of tm fuada to moot tha ootste of Keabera* txw%l ^Wfawreit could be shown to he of assistance to Members in carrying out their dutieseffectively: one was to provide for travel within the United Kingdom and the other for travel overseas.

19.   Free travel within the country on Parliamentary buainesa is a facility whichis commonly available to Parliamentarians in other European and commonwealth countries.    It is, moreover, a normal feature of business and professional life.We see no objection in principle to, and many practical advantages in the provisionof a similar facility for Members of Parliament, subject to certain conditions.Clearly, qualifying travel under an arrangement of this kind would have to be restricted to travel undertaken on Parliamentary business.   Thia would includeconstituency business of a non-political nature but would exclude travel forparty political purposes.   We recognise that travel on political * and ontPa^liamenta^y, business might overlap on occasion, but we believe that a distinction could be drawn and, that it is not impossible for the House to administ-er such an arrangement.   Members are, of course, already provided with travel facilities which are in some ways more generous than those normally available(for example, the cost of their travel between home and work is met, although itis subject to taxation, and limited provision existB for free travel by a wifeor husband).   But these arrangements stem from the recognised facts of a Member*8life and, in particular, from the fact that two separate and equally importantplaces of work are involved.   They do not, in our view, detract from the importanceof enabling Membera to travel within the United Kingdom to inform themselves onsubjects that are directly relevant to the work of Parliament and to effectiverepresentation of their constituency.   Membera should not be constrained by financial considerations from undertaking necessary travel for these purposes,and we consider that all United Kingdom travel on Parliamentary business shouldqualify for reimbursement of costs or for payment of oar mileage allowance.Recommendation. We recommend that the costs of all travel within the UnitedKingdom on Parliamentary business should be reimbursed or should qualify for payment of the car mileage allowance.Postage and telephone costs20.   The present arrangements provide Members with free postage from Westminsterto destinations within the United Kingdom.   The facility is restricted to parliamentary business and may not be used for circulars to constituents or toother Members.   Telephone calls from the Houbo are free on the same basis.21.   The greater part of the evidence put to us on these arrangements has suggested an extension of the facilities to apply to postage and telephone oallsmade from the homes or constituencies of Members.   In general, we consider the10
facilities provided for Members at Westminster are adequate and that an extensionof free postage or telephone arrangements beyond Westminster would not be appropriate.   But one improvement is justified.   It has been suggested to us thattelephone calls on Parliamentary business from the House to other countries ofthe European Economic Community should be provided free.   We consider it reasonablethat both telephone calls and postage facilities should be provided free of chargefronv Westt&amp;last-ST on this basis.Recommendation.   We recommend that the free postage and telephone facilities at westminster should be extended to apply to communications with other e.c. countries on Parliamentary business.Severance arrangements22.   We made no recommendations last year on the provisions for the payment of agrant under the severance arrangements.   These arrangements stem from our 1971review, when we found that the timing of general elections left Members little time or opportunity for finding alternative employment, because of their pre-occupation with seeking re-election.   At that tiae, a Member ceased to be paid from the date of the dissolution of Parliament, and those who subsequently lost their seats could suddenly find that they had no regular source of income.   we made two recommendations to relieve this situation: that salary should continueto be paid through a period of dissolution; and 1hat a severance arrangement should be introduced whereby Members who lost their seat in these circumstances could claim a grant equivalent to three months&apos; salary.   At the same time, we suggested that the position of Members under the National Insurance Act should bere-examined, as their classification for national insurance purposes did notentitle them to unemployment benefit or to redundancy payments.   The severancepayment scheme was implemented and was applied also to Members who lost their seatsbecause of constituency boundary changes.   In the February 1974 and Ootober 1974general elections, 79 of the 81 Members who were defeated claimed the severancepayment; all of the 16 Members who lost their seats in February 1974 as a resultof constituency boundary changes also claimed.23.   In the course of the current review, changes in the severance arrangements have been suggested to us by many people.   About half of the Members who replied to our questionnaire suggested various improvements in the scheme that were fairly evenly divided between suggestions for a higher level of payment (six ortwelve months&apos; salary), for a system based on length of service (sometimes subjectto minima and maxima), and various general proposals that included age-related11
1 Appendix A, Table 2212payments and. application of the arrangements to cases where a Member voluntarilyresigns his seat or is not re-adopted as a candidate.^24.   However, we have to consider the severance arrangements now in the light ofa new development.    Since April 1975, MPs have been re-classified for national insurance purposes and will in due course become eligible for unemployment benefit in the event of losing their seat at a general election, and may become eligiblefor redundancy payments if a seat disappears as a result of re-organisation of constituencies.   We welcome this development as MPs will now become eligible forthe type of short-term assistance which we noted was not available when werecommended the introduction of the severance arrangements.   We sea this as animportant supplement to the separate severanoe arrangements, which in the appropriate-ats situation can be regarded either as an occupational redundancy payment scheme,or as a scheme for payment in lieu of notice.   In either case, depending on individual circumstances, the severance arrangements may provide better compensa-tion than the statutory minimum provisions whioh would otherwise apply (and weunderstand that the payment of a grant equivalent to three months1 salary islikely to have the effect of postponing payment of unemployment benefit for aperiod of three months).   But we also consider that, in the new circumstances, itis not necessary to increase the level of benefit provided by the existing severancearrangements.   We therefore make no reoommendation other than that, in.any circumstances in whioh a Member would qualify for redundancy payments, the severance arrangements should be available only as an alternative to such payments.Reoommendation. We recommend that the grant under the severance arrangements shouldbe available only as an alternative to redundancy payments in cases where a Memberbecomes entitled to such payments: otherwise, the severanoe arrangements should remain unchanged.
CHAPTER 3: THE PARLIAMENTARY PENSION SCHEMEBackground25,   The Parliamentary Contributory Pension Scheme for Members was first introduced in 1965 under the provisions of the Ministerial Salaries and Members&apos; Pension Act1965t following the October 19^4 recommendations of the Lawrence Committee .   it provided a compulsory pension scheme based on a fund managed by Trustees appoint-ed by the House of Commons, and effective from the date of the October 1964general election that brought in a new Parliament.   Members who had retired, beforethe date of the introduction of the scheme were not oovered by it.   But those whose service continued into the new Parliament could count up to 10 years ofservice prior to October 1964 as reckonable for pension purposes; this also appliedto Members who lost their seats in October 19^4 or earlier and who were returnedsubsequently to Parliament.   The scheme required equal contributions in respect of current service from Members and from public funds, and pension benefits accruedat one rate for the first 15 years of service and at a lower rate for a further30 years, providing a maximum pension of 60 per cent of final salary after 45 years&apos;service.   The normal retirement age was 65 and pension was not payable before thatage.   Other benefits were provided, including pensions for widows and dependent children, and refund of contributions (in certain circumstances) or transfer ofpension rights.26.   Prior to the introduction of the scheme, the only form of finanoial assist-ance available to former Members was provided through the House of Commons Members&apos;?und which had been established by Act of Parliament in 1939 to make grants (basedon an assessment of need) to former Members and to their widows and dependent children.   An amending Act of 1948 extended the provision of grants to widowers.The Members1 Fund is still in being and oontinues to provide for any former Memberwho may be in financial need, including a Member who may have retired under thecurrent pension scheme with an inadequate pension and without other resources.Prom the outset, the Fund has been financed by an annual levy of  24 on allserving Members, a maximum annual contribution from public funds of  22,000, and dividends and interest from investments.   Like the Parliamentary ContributoryPension Fund, the Members&apos; Fund is administered by Trustees appointed by theHoubb of Commons.1 Report of the Committee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members of ParliamentCmnd. 2516: Chairman, Sir Geoffrey Lawrence.13
27.   We reviewed the working of the pension arrangements in 1971, and we made anumber of recommendations in our PirBt Report which were implemented with effect from 1 January 1972, and which provided substantial improvements in the benefitsavailable under the pension scheme.   The scheme continues to be compulsory, and now provides for an even rate of accrual of pension entitlement of l/60th of finalsalary for each year of service up to a maximum of 40 years&apos; service,^ giving amaximum pension of two-thirds of final salary.   The normal retirement age for thepurpose of the scheme remains 65.   Other benefits include a death-in-servicegratuity equivalent to 12 months&apos; salary; an option for early retirement at age60 or later on immediate payment of an actuarially reduced pension; pensions for widows and dependents; and an option to commute pension entitlement to yield a lump sum of up to 3/80ths of final salary for each year of service (which provides* maximum lump sum payment of      times final salary together with a maximum pensionapproximately equal to one-half of final salary).   We also recommended that therate of contribution required of a Member should be 5 per cent of salary.   this rate met approximately 3/8ths of the total current cost of the scheme at thattime; in practice, current costs have risen to about 15 per cent of salary and the &quot;Member *s contribution has remained 5 per cent.28.   Two main developments have affected Members&apos; pensions since our 1971 recommenda-tions were implemented.   The first is that they have been brought within the scope0f the Pensions (increase) Act 1971 and, consequently, retired Members&apos; pensions*re increased in line with movements in the cost of living.   We note in passingthat, because of the infrequency with which Members&apos; salary is reviewed, thisProvision has had the effect of requiring special administrative arrangements toensure that those Members who retired later on the same final salary as those whokad retired earlier did not in practice receive a lower pension than their pre-^ecessors whose pensions had been increased in the interval.The second development results from our recommendation last year of a salarylevel of  8,000 for Members of Parliament.   As we have noted (paragraph 3) thisSalary was accepted by Parliament   as the appropriate rate for the job but wasRot fully implemented: it was decided, however, that it would be used as a notional^ary for pension purposes, and this decision will be given legislative effect bythe provisions of the Parliamentary and other Pensions and Salaries Bill, currentlybefore Parliament.   Members are required to pay a pensions contribution of 5 percsnt of their pensionable salary, and they now receive additional emoluments ofIn practice, we understand that the legislation whioh governs the scheme needs to be clarified on this point.3y a resolution of the House of Commons accepted in the Debate followingpublication of our Report No 1 (House of Commons Hansard, Volume 896, No 165,22 July 1975). uCONFIDENTIAL
 112.50 a year to provide for the contribution required on the difference betweenthe pensionable salary of  8,000 and the actual salary of  5,750.   We point thisout as one more manifestation of the disadvantages of not paying the proper levelof salary for the job.30.   We now discuss the issues that arise on Members&apos; pensions.   Ministers andother paid office holders are eligible to participate in a supplementary scheme that we recommended in 1971 and that is designed to give pension entitlement inrespect of the additional element of pay attached to Ministerial or other office.We deal with the pensions of Ministers and other office holders, including thestatutory pensions attached to certain offices, in Chapter 4.Service prior to October 196431.   Two distinct but related points arise in relation to the effective date ofthe present form of contributory pension scheme for Members of Parliament.   Thefirst is whether those Members who retired before October 1964 and who have nosubsequent service in the House of Commons should be entitled to any benefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund; and the second is the amountof service prior to October 1964 that qualifies as reokonable towards the pension entitlement of those who have been Members of the House of Commons since that date.32.   We have received a substantial amount of evidence on the first point and wehave noted that it has been the subject of continuing Parliamentary concern.   in recommending the introduction of the present form of pension scheme, the lawrence committee expressed the view unequivocally that the principle of applying a pension scheme to those who had no service after the date when the scheme began was not1 2acceptable .   The issue was re-examined in our First Report   when we found ourselvesUnable to modify the conclusion of the Lawrence Committee on this point of pensionsPrinciple and practice.   We took the view that it remained appropriate for oases offinancial hardship among former Members who had retired before October 1964 to bemet by the Members&apos; Fund.33. We have again reviewed the evidence carefully. We recognise that only asmall, and indeed dwindling, number of Members would be involved and that thecost of extending pension arrangements to cover them might not be prohibitive.Report of the Committee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members of^ Parliament - Cmnd. 2516 (paragraph 76).Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report: Ministers of the Crown and Membersof Parliament - Cmnd. 4836 (paragraphs 69 and 70).15
CONFIDENTIALNevertheless, there is the point of prinoiple here, and it cannot simply be dis-missed in the Wider context of pension provisions as a whole.    The position ofthis small number of former Members is by no means unique: for example, we havebeen told that over the years up to 1964, and indeed right up until 1973*, therewill have been hundreds of thousands in the public sector who retired with nopension entitlement and are therefore in the same position; there are also many other, if smaller-scale, instances in the private sector.   After much thought, weremain ourselves unable to recaasaaad that form? Meabers who have no service afterthe introduction of the Parliamentary pension scheme should be entitled to benefit from that scheme.    The Members&apos; Fund continues in being and, while we recognisethat it cannot provide an as-of-right pension, we consider that it remains theappropriate channel through which to provide for the needs of former Members (andof their dependents), including those who retired before October 1964*34*   However, wa offer one further comment.   If it were the desire of parliament as a whole that some additional provision should be made for those Members whobad retired before the introduction of the present pension scheme, it might be appropriate to give consideration to an arrangenent in parallel to the StatePension arrangements for the over-80&apos;s, whereby some limited benefit would bemade available &amp;a of right for such Members at age 80.   Clearly, this would be amatter for Parliament to consider and we ourselves make no formal reoommendationon this matter.35*   The Parliamentary scheme provides for a maximum of 10 years of service priorto October 1964 to be counted by serving Members as reckonable for pensionPurposes, as recommended by the Lawrence Committee in 19^4*   The cost is met bya deficiency contribution from public funds.   He did not recommend change inthis provision in our First Report: the other improvements recommended then greatlyenhanced the pensions payable to Members who had service prior to October 1964,and we took the view that this was as far as we should go at that time .   We have examined the position again in the course of our ourrent review, when it has beensuggested to us, as indeed it was in 1971, that all such service should bereckonable for pension purposes.   We do not regard this as appropriate, but weconsider that a limited improvement is justified and would be aooeptable againstthe background of our conclusions on the pensions arrangements as a whole.   Wetherefore propose that the maximum amount of reckonable service prior to October1964 Bhould be increased by 5 years.   The benefit from this improvement Bhould bePestrioted to those Members who have service in the House of Commons after its introduction and, as at present, the cost of reckonable past servioe should be1 It was not until 1973 that pension cover extended to all employees throughoutthe whole of the public servioe field.Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report: Ministers of the Crown and Membersof Parliament - Cmnd. 4836 (paragraph 69).
If) CONFIDENTIALmet from public funds.   We estimate the capital cost of this improvement to be 200,000 (including provision for those with qualifying service of more than 10years who are not Members at present but who may be returned to the House ofCommons in the future).Recormrmndation. We recommend that the maximum amount of service prior to October1964 that may be treated as reckonable service for pension purposes should beincreased from 10 years to 15 years.   This improvement should apply only to members who are in service in the House of Commons at the time of its implement a-tion (or who subsequently return to such service).   The full cost of this recommenda-tion should be met from public fundB.Hate of accrual        136.   During our current review, we have received a number of representations aboutthe rate at which pension entitlement is accrued under the Parliamentary scheme.Some 72 per cent of the Members who replied to our questionnaire said that theyfavoured a faster rate of accrual: and the respondents who specified a particularrate of accrual were evenly divided between those who advocated a rate of l/40thof final salary a year and those who advocated other rates1,   A wide range ofrates of accrual was also suggested to us in other evidence.37.   The point most often put forward in support of a faster rate of accrual isthat it is rare for an MP to be able to serve in the House of Commons for the40 years necessary under the present arrangements to qualify for full pension entitlement.   We have been told that the average length of service as an MP is17-20 years.   Nevertheless, certain other points also have to be taken intoconsideration.   A career in Parliament is not unique in being a late-entry career,and a 40-year accrual period is standard elsewhere in the public servioes (with one or two exceptions that are mainly related to particularly hazardous andPhysically demanding jobs - for example, in the police and fire services - and&quot;^&quot;6 judiciary where it is unusual for a judge to be appointed under age 50).Moreover, it is becoming increasingly common for pension entitlement to be pre-served or transferred from one scheme to another and MPs may benefit from this in the same way as other people.   Finally, the cost of a faster rate of accrualcould be high, particularly if Members had to bear the whole cost themselves.38*   The recommendations that we make in this chapter will achieve some of thecbjectives of a faster rate of accrual and will, we believe, prove more beneficialAppendix A, Tables 23 and 24.17
to Members as a whole. We consider that the rate of accrual under the Parliamentaryscheme should not be changed.Interest on refunded contributions39.   It has been suggested to us that the rate of interest paid on the contributionsrefunded to a Member who leaves the Parliamentary pension scheme before completing the four-year period of service necessary to qualify for pension entitlementshould be increased.   The present rate of interest of 3 per cent has applied sincethe scheme was introduced.40.   Clearly, the rate is low by oomparison with current interest rates generally and, indeed, it is well below the current rate of yield on the Pension Fund-sinvestments.   We have been told that the rate of interest for refunds has to haveregard to the trend of interest rates over a long-term period and obviously thisprovides stability (which we see as important).   It is even more important to hear in mind that contributions to a pension scheme are deducted from income&quot;before that income is assessed for tax: consequently a refund of contributionsis subject to income tax.   But in these cirourastances, subject to the approval ofthe Inland Revenue, the tax is levied at a concessionary rate of 10 per cent.Clearly, this ooncession itself compensates to some extent for the interest thatMight otherwise have been earned on the money.41.   Against this background, we do not consider that a case for an increase inthe rate of interest on returned contributions to the level of current interest rates generally can be sustained.   We consider that a limited increase is justified and we propose that the rate should be improved from 3 per oent to  per cent in respect of contributions made from a current date.Recommendation.   We recommend that the rate of interest paid on returnedcontributions to the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Scheme should be increased from 3 per cent to 4 per cent.   The higher rate should apply only to the refundof those contributions made after the effective date of implementation of this  commendat i on.Added years42.   The introduction into the Parliamentary pension scheme of a facility forthe optional purchase of added years of reckonable service has been widely18
advocated during the current review.   Some three-quarters of the respondents toour questionnaire indicated support for it   and it was also mentioned frequentlyin other evidence.   We see this issue as in some ways related to the question ofa faster rate of accrual of pension entitlement (paragraphs 36-38) in the sense that it is an alternative whioh provides the essence of the benefit aimed at.We have concluded that an added years scheme would be an appropriate addition tothe existing provisions under the Tarllamentary pension soheme.43.   We propose that an added years arrangement should be introduced on the follow-ing basis.   It should be optional and the full cost should be borne by theindividual Member.   It will apply only to those who are Members of parliament at the time of its introduction and to those who enter, or re-enter, the House ofCommons subsequently.   The normal Inland Revenue requirements on total contribution and maximum reckonable service will apply.   We understand that purchase of addedyears may normally be either by a single lump sum payment within a period of 12months of entry or by periodical contributions from salary to the date of retirement.44.   We also propose that the added years whioh have actually been purchased bythe time of cessation of servioe as a Member Should count towards the four-year period of service necessary to qualify for pension entitlement.   When the causeof cessation of service is either death or early retirement because of ill-health,the total number of added years of service that the Member has contracted topurchase (as distinct from the number actually purchased at that time) should be counted for pension purposes and the rates of contribution should be oaloulatedon a basis that will allow for this.   We oonsider that the special circumstancesof a Parliamentary career justify this.   On the same grounds, in oases where aMember contracts to purchase added years by periodical contribution and resumes a parliamentary career after a break in servioe, resumption of the purchase of addedyearB should be at the rate that applied previously.45.   The details of the arrangement will need to be worked out, and a range of contribution rates by both methods of contribution will need to be oaloulatedin consultation with the Government Aotuary^s Department.   For contribution bysingle lump sum payment, we have been advised that the aotuarially calculated.Payment factors based on the Parliamentary soheme alone are sufficiently close to the factors that are derived from the Publio Servioe Transfer Value tablesto allow these factors to be used.   We take the view that this should be done.Appendix A, Table 23.19
CONFIDENTIAL46.   We do not consider it appropriate to extend the added years option to the supplementary pension scheme for Ministers and other paid office holders.   we discuss this point more fully in Chapter 4, where we make certain proposals totake account of the position of Ministers and paid offioe holders who are Membersof the House of Lords.Recommendatlon* We recommend that tbe Parliamentary Contributory Pension scheme should include provision for the optional purchase by Members of Parliament ofadded years of service that may be counted as reckonable for pension purposes.This arrangement should apply only to those who are Members of Parliament at thetime of its introduction and to those who enter, or re-enter, the House of Commonssubsequently.   The detailed arrangements should be based on the guidelines thatwe have indicated.Hl-health retirement47.   We consider that provision for early retirement on grounds of ill-health should be introduced into the Parliamentary pension scheme, to enable a member to retire with immediate payment of pension in these oiroumstanoes.   The circumstances-stances of an MP*s remployment * are, however, unusual.   A Member of Parliament isnot an *employee* in the standard sense, and it may be that attention will need to &quot;be given to this point in working out the details of the arrangement that we propose.   Apart from stipulating the obvious requirement that early retirement onill-health grounds would have to be supported by independent medical evidence, we regard it as appropriate to leave the details of definition and conditions to be worked out by those who are responsible for the administration of the scheme.48.   The scheme should provide for appropriate enhancements to the amount ofservice that is reckonable for pension entitlement when a Member retires early on grounds of ill-health1.   In all oases, the enhancements should apply only tothe extent that they do not provide reokonable servioe in excess of the amountthat would have been reokonable if the Member had continued to serve to age 65.A similar arrangement should be available to former Members who have left theBouse of Commons but who have a pension entitlement under the Parliamentaryscheme which would normally beoorae payable at age 65: if such former members should have to retire from their present employment through ill-health before reaching age 65, they should reoeive immediate payment of their * frozen&apos; pensionThe enhancements might be modelled on the arrangements that apply in other partsof the public services, modified where necessary to be compatible with thecircumstances of Parliamentary servioe.20
entitlement, provided that the ill-health requirements of the Parliamentaryscheme are met.   It would not be appropriate, however, for the enhancement arrange-ments for serving Members to be applied in these cases: the responsibility fora facility of this kind would continue to lie with the pension arrangements inthe individual*s current employment.49.   We estimate the approximate capital cost of providing an ill-health retire-nient arrangement on these lines to be about  400,000.   We discuss later (Chapter 4)the implications of extending a similar arrangement to the supplementary pension scheme for Ministers and other office holders.recommend at ion. We recommend that provision should be made in the ParliamentaryContributory Pension Scheme for early retirement on grounds of ill-health withimmediate payment of a pension based on redeemable service to date, enhanced where appropriate.   The provision should be based on the guidelines that we have indicated,including the counting in full towards reokonable servioe of any added years aMember may have contracted to purchase (paragraph 44)*   Former Members who areho longer in the House of Commons, but who have a ^frozen&apos; pension entitlementunder the Parliamentary soheme, should be entitled to immediate payment of theirkoorued pension (without enhancement) if they have to retire from subsequentemployment on grounds of ill-health before age 65.yidowg&apos; and dependents1 pensions50.   We have examined the provisions of the Parliamentary scheme for the paymentQf pensions to widows and dependent children.   The present arrangements providea widow,s pension of half the pension entitlement of her husband and an additionall/6th of that entitlement in respect of each dependent child under age 16.   A. limpBa&quot;t gratuity equivalent to one year*a salary is also paid to the widow of a**aber who dies in servioe.51.   We suggest a number of improvementa in the widows&apos; pension arrangements.First, we consider that the basic pension entitlement should be increased inCases where a Member dies in servioe.   Our reoommendation for enhancement ofPension entitlement in cases of early retirement through ill-health (paragraph 49)Bbould be applied for the purpose of calculating the amount of servioe reokonablefor the payment of pension to the widow of a Member who dies in servios (againObject to a maximum equal to the amount of service that would have been reokonable*f the Member had continued to serve to age 65).   ThiB use of enhancement is21
common in other schemes that provide an arrangement for retirement on ill-healthgrounds and we consider it appropriate to extend the arrangement to the Parliamentaryscheme.   We estimate the capital cost of this provision to be some  375.000.52.    Second, we consider that the arrangements for short-term finanoial assistancein the early months of widowhood should be improved, to include certain newfacilities in addition to the gratuity payable to the widow of a Member who diesin service.   In these circumstances, where the Member who dies in service had thenecessary amount of service to qualify for a pension, his widow should continue toreceive his full salary for a period of 3 months, at the end of which the widowfBpension and, where appropriate, the pension for dependent ohildren will become payable.   A parallel arrangement should apply in cases of death in service wherethe Member had insufficient service to qualify for a pension: in these oases, the widow should receive the Member,s full salary for 3 months if she has no dependent children (as defined under the Parliamentary soheme), for tife months if she hasone dependent child, and for 6 months if she has two or more dependent ohildren.Where a Member dies after retirement, his widow should continue to receive the full amount of his pension for a period of 3 months.   We also propose that these arrange-tnents should apply equally in the oase of a woman Member who dies leaving adependent widower.   We estimate the capital cost of this provision to be approximately  150,000,53.   We have been told that clarification is needed of the pension position ofthe widow, of a Member who dies after retiring between age 6*0 and age 65 with anactuarially reduced pension under the existing early retirement option.   Thenormal choices in such cases are that where the husband takes an early pensionwith the appropriate actuarial reduction, on his death the widow subsequentlyreceives half of the reduced pension; alternatively, a greater aotuarial reductionmay be applied to the husband^ pension in order to allow the subsequent paymentof an unreduced widow*s pension (that is, based on the pension that the husbandwould have received if he had ^frozen&apos; his pension entitlement instead of optingfor the actuarial reduction).   We have been told that the legislation whichffoverns the Parliamentary scheme does not make clear which of these alternativesis intended to be applied.   But we also understand that the aotuarial reductionsaPplied to the pensions of Members who opt for early retirement are based on theassumption that the widow,s pension will not be reduced.   We consider the secondapproach preferable and we suggest that an early opportunity should be taken toolarify the governing legislation accordingly.   Ho additional cost will arise.22
54*   Finally, two other improvements in the death-in-service provisions are justified.   First, the present requirement of 12 months&apos; service as a Member to qualify for the death-in-servioe gratuity should be abolished as it has been inother pension schemes throughout the public services.   Ho significant additional cost will arise from this.   Second, we oonsider that the administrative arrange-ments relating to the death-in-servioe gratuity should be simplified by allowing a Member to nominate wife or husband as next-of-kin in order to facilitate paymentof the gratuity to a Member&apos;a widow or widower before grant of probate.55.   We propose no further changes in the pension provisions for widows anddependent children.   The suggestion has besn made to us that tbe proportions ofa Member&apos;s pension payable in respect both of widows and of dependent children should be increased.   But we are satisfied that with the improvements that werecommend, the parliamentary scheme will provide a satisfactory level of pension for widows and dependent ohildren.   We should add that our references to theprovisions of other public servioe pension schemes do not imply that these sohemesshould provide a rigid measure of the pension benefits that should apply to Membersof Parliament: this would clearly not be appropriate in relation to particularfeatures of the job.   Nor do we imply that the provisions of pension sohemes inthe private sector in general are irrelevant.   But we have considered it as right and proper to have general regard to the provisions for pensions in other partsof the public servioe as a broad check on the arrangements for Members of Parliament.Recommendations.   We recommend that the enhancement arrangements proposed forthe calculation of reckonable servioe in cases of retirement through ill-health should be applied to the basis of calculation of the pension payable to the widowof a Member who dies in servioe.   The calculation of the amount of reokonableservice in such oases should inolude in full any added years that the Member mayaave contracted to purohase.   He also recommend that arrangements for financialassistance to widows in the early months of widowhood should be introduced as&quot;pooified (paragraph 52); that the legislation governing the Parliamentary sohemeshould be clarified to ensure that the pension of the widow of a Member who wasin receipt of an aotuarially reduced pension following early retirement under theexisting arrangements is based on the pension that her husband would have receivedbut for the actuarial reduction (paragraph 53)i and that the requirement of 12months&apos; servioe to qualify for payment of the death-in-servioe gratuity should be abolished.   As a matter of simplification and convenience, we further recommend&quot;Ijbat a Member should be able to nominate wife or husband as next-of-kin for thePurpose of payment of the deatb-in-eervioe gratuity.23
Early retirement56.   The present arrangements for voluntary early retirement, which we recommended in 1971r require a Member who takeB advantage of them to accept an actuariallyreduced pension.   The penalty imposed by this reduction is heavy: for example, aMember with 20 years1 servioe in the House of Commons who opts for this arrange-ment at age 60 would receive a pension of  1,707 a year, compared with  2,667 ayear which would be received if the pension entitlement were tfro2en* until age65 (both amounts are based on the recommended salary of  8,000).57*   We have considered whether the normal retirement age of an MP should bereduced - perhaps to 60 - to improve the position.   But without a faster rate ofaccrual of pension entitlement (whioh, as we have explained in paragraphs 36-38,we do not see as appropriate) the net result is likely to be that fewer members would be able to serve for long enough to qualify for the full pension entitlementby the normal age of retirement.   In these circumstances, and against the generalbackground of the nature and pattern of a Parliamentary career, we do not considerthat it would be right to reduoe the normal retirement age at this time.   However,we consider that a new early retirement option should be introduced.   We have noted that some other pension schemes with a similar normal retirement age haveprovision for early retirement on immediate payment of the full pension accruedto the date of retirement (ie without an actuarial reduction) subject to completionof a minimum period of service (commonly, 25 years).   He understand that one resultof incorporating an open option of this kind into the Parliamentary soheme would effectively be to reduce, in certain circumstanoee, the normal retirement age of65? these circumstances would inolude the payment of preserved pension entitlementand the calculation of the maximum pension allowable under the ill-health retire-ment arrangementb that we reootnmend.   We see both these oonsequenoes - butparticularly the one relating to retirement on ill-health grounds - as undesirableand, instead, we propose that an option should be introduced into the Parliamentaryscheme, which could be exercised at the end of a Parliament if a Member were age62 or over and had completed 25 years&apos; service as a Member; the exeroise of the option in individual cases would be subject to the approval of the Trustees ofthe Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund.   The existing early retirement optionshould continue in being to provide for those Members who want to retire early but who do not qualify under the new arrangement.   We estimate the oapital ooat ofthis provision in practice to be not muoh above  50,000.24
CONFIDENTIALRecommendation. We recommend that an additional early retirement option to beexercised at the end of a Parliament should be introduced, under which any Memberwho has reached the age of 62 and has completed 25 years&apos; service in the House ofCommons would be able to retire, subject to the approval of the Trustees of theParliamentary Contributory Pension Fund, with immediate payment of the pension entitlement accrued to the date of retirement.Rates of contribution58.   The implementation of our recommendations for improvements to the Parliamentarypension scheme will give rise to a total capital cost of some  1^ million (excluding&quot;the scheme for the Optional purchase of added years of reokonable service, thecost of which will be borne entirely by the individual Member).   This will require an increase of rather more than 1-J per oent in the total contribution under thescheme, and will raise it from 23&amp; per cent to nearly 25^- per cent of the Member,spensionable salary.   (The total contribution includes both the current contribution from Members and from public funds - whioh together amount currently to 15 per cent of pensionable salary - and the deficiency payments met entirely from public funds).59.   We have considered how the additional cost should be met.   Clearly, members will receive substantial benefits from the improvements that we have recommended,and they should therefore bear some part of the cost.   On the other hand, some per cent of the additional contribution will be required to fund the improvements in respect of the past service of serving MemberB (including the cost of the&quot;Additional years of reckonable service prior to October 1964 which we have recommend-od should be met entirely from public funds).   We propose that this part of the&quot;Additional contribution should be met from public funds, and that the balance shouldhe met by increasing the contribution required of Members.60,   We have said that we do not regard the provisions of other public service pension schemes as an absolute standard for the Parliamentary scheme.   Neverthe-less, the improvements which we have reooramended will bring the benefits of theParliamentary scheme close to those provided in public servioe schemes generally;where those schemes are contributory, a standard rate of employee,s contribution of 6 per cent of pensionable salary is applied.   In these circumstances, weconsider it appropriate that the Members* contribution rate should be increased to6 per cent of pensionable salary.   This will restore the proportion of the currentoost of the scheme borne by Members to approximately -$the of the total.Roonrnmawaation.   We recommend that the cost of implementing the reoommended improve-vents in the Parliamentary pension scheme should be met in part by increasing the contribution required of Members from 5 per oent to 6 per oent of pensionableSalary.   The balance of the cost should be met from publio funds.25CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 4: THE REMUNERATION OP MINISTERS AND OTHER OFFICE HOLDERSBackground6*1.   We now consider the issues that arise on the Ministerial pay structure,including the position of Ministers and other office holders who are Members ofthe House of Lords; the salary levels appropriate to the range of appointmentscovered by our remit; and Ministerial pensions (inoluding the statutory pensionsattached to the offices of the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker and the Lord Chanoellor).A list of the Ministerial and other appointments with which we are concerned, andthe current salaries, is in Appendix C,62,   These salaries have been in force since 1 April 1972 when, following theintroduction of the necessary legislation, the recommendations in our First Reportin November 1971 were implemented1.   In addition to the salary attached to theparticular appointment, Ministers and offioe holders who are Members of theHouse of Commons are eligible, with oertain modifications, for the allowancesavailable to MPs and are paid both the London supplement and the parliamentary salary.   In our Report No 7, we recommended that the Parliamentary salary shouldbe increased from  3,000 to  5,000.   This recommendation has not yet been implemented in full: Cabinet Ministsrs have eleoted to oontinue to be paid the1972 Parliamentary salary of  3,000 and other Ministers and office holders are currently paid  3,700.63.   Ministers and other office holders who are Members of the House of Lordsare not eligible for the Parliamentary salary or for the allowances (other thanthe London Supplement) available to those in the House of Commons,   However, by resolution of both Houses of Parliament, since 13 June 1975 they have been entitledto claim against the Peers&apos; expenses allowance up to a maximum of  700 a year: thefirst  100 a year of these claims is allowed free of tax.Our approach64.   Before dealing in detail with the Balary levels of Ministers and other officeholders, we desoriba the general considerations that we have taken into aooountin arriving at our conclusions,1   The offioe of Prinoipal Deputy Chairman of Committees in the House of Lordshas been created sinoe our laBt review and with effect from 10 April 1974.The current salary of  5,500 a year corresponds to the current (l April 1972)salary of the Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.26
65.   We have already said (paragraph 7) that the salary levels which we now recommended are those that were appropriate at 13 June 1975, the date onwhich wc submitted our earlier recommendations.   At that time, the currentsalary levelb for Ministers and other office holders had been in force unchangedfor a little over three years - a period during which the general index of retail prices rose by some 63 per cent, average salaries &quot;by some 64 per cent and average earnings by some 74 par oent .   Obviously, these price and wagemovements cannot be oonsidered in isolation, but they are indicators of theextent to which the value of the pay of Ministers and offioe holders has beeneroded during a period of rapid inflation in whioh there has been no reviewof their salaries.   Judged against the intervening inorease in retail prices,for example, the Cabinet Minister^ April 1972 salary of  13,000 was worthsome  7,975 in June 1975 (and some  6,890 today).    Clearly, some acoount ofthis has to be taken in our recommendations.66.   Other factors also have to be taken into aooount against this generalbackground.   The salary that we recommended for Members of Parliament includedan element of revaluation of the job whioh our inquiries showed to be justified.It is clear that the demands of Ministerial offioe are heavy, but this has long been bo and the evidenoe suggests thati in general, the weight of responsible-ility has not changed across the whole field of Ministerial and other appoint-ments since our last review.to an extent whioh would justify an overall revalua-tion of the appointments with which we are concerned.   Our general approach ia,therefore, to bring the salaries up to date.   Nevertheless, a measure ofrevaluation iB appropriate for Qartain posts and levels of appointment either because of changes in the nature or circumstances of the job, or becauseexperience has indicated that the level of salary that we recommended in 1971did not fully reflect the position at that time.   In recommending revisedlevels of salary for Ministers and offioe holders, we have to bear in mind ourearlier recommendations for MPs1 pay and for the Parliamentary salary as wellas the salaries recommended in our Report No 6^ for senior appointments in&apos; The movement in average salaries is based on the index of average salariesto April 1975 and promoted to June 1975 by the index of average earnings.Because of the significant increase in the index of average earnings betweenJune and July 1975, whioh arose in part from agreements with ratroapeotiveeffect to mid-June or earlier, an average of the May and July indices has been used in place of the June index.2Although there may have been individual exceptions, most notably in the oaseof the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland - an appointment whioh did not exist at the time of our last review.^ P^view Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd. 5846,December 1974.27
other parts of the public services.   The level of earnings outside Parliament arealso relevant &quot;both in particular oases (for example, judicial salaries to the salary of Lord Chanoellor, snd professional earnings to the salaries of theLaw Officers) and overall: it is clear that in general salaries equivalentto levels at the upper end of the appointments with which we are oonoernedhere have increased significantly more slowly between 1972 and 1975 than hasthe level of average salaries (which was approximately  2,250 in April 1972and estimated at a little over  3,700 in June 1975)*   Evidence of this is also provided in the Report on Higher Incomes from employment of the Royal Commissionon the Distribution of Income and Health.   We take full aooount of this factor in our recommendations.267.   Finally, as we recognised in&apos; our First Report , some aooount has to betaken of the &quot;total salary&apos; of Ministers and office holders which, for thosewho are Members of the House of Commons, includes the Parliamentary salarywhich we have recommended should be  5,000 a year.   In the course of thiBreview, we have received representations about the position of Ministers andoffice holders in the House of Lords.   Most of those who have raised this matter with us have been concerned at the differenoe in total remuneration between an appointment in the House of Lords and another at the same level in the House ofCommons.   There are two separate but related aspects to this problem.   The first is that Ministerial salaries in general are now more than four years out of date so that, for example, a Parliamentary Secretary or Under Secretary inthe House of Lords currently reoeives a lower salary ( 5(500) than a backbenchKP ( 5,750 following the restricted implementation of the recommended salary of 8,000 in our Report No 7)*   The second is the difference in total remunerationthat stems from the fact that Ministers and office holders in the House ofCommons receive the salary attached to the office and in addition theParliamentary salary, whereas Ministers and office holders in the House ofLords receive only the salary attached to the office and the London supplement(for which all Ministers and office holders are eligible) and have their limitedentitlement to claim against the Peers&apos; expenses allowance.68.   The Parliamentary Balary and the allowances available to Ministers andoffice holders in the House of Commons recognise the additional burden ofconstituency duties and responsibilities whioh they oontinue to carry and which members of the House of Lords do not have.   Moreover, since our 1971 review,^ Royal Commission on the Distribution of Inoome and Health, Report No 3: HigherInoomes from Employment - Cmnd. 6383, January 1976: Chairman, Lord Diamond.2Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report: Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament - Cmnd. 4836 (paragraph 91)*28
the Parliamentary Balary has bean recognised ae providing an element of rsmunsra-tion for the work of representing a constituency whereas, previously, it hadbeen related notionally to the average amount of expenses incurred in carryingout Parliamentary duties.   However, the relationship of the Parliamentary salaryboth to the full Member*s salary and to the salaries of Ministers and otheroffice holders will need to be re-examined at the time of the next review ofParliamentary remuneration and in the light of the circumstances at that time.69.   It has also bean suggested to us that, because of the differences in totalremuneration, a higher salary should be paid to Ministers and offioe holders inthe House of Lords than to the equivalent appointments in the House of Commons.But a differential salary struoture of this nature oould be justified only ifthe workload or level of responsibility (or both) of Ministers and officeholders in the House of Lords were generally greater than for the equivalentappointments in the House of Commons.   We have found no evidence to support this and we do not recommend suoh a differential in Ministerial salaries.70.   In the following paragraphs we discuss tbe detailed issues and putforward recommendations for the Ministerial and other offices with whiohwe are concerned.   We have also shown separately (paragraph 104) our recommendedsalaries in net-of-tax terms, based on the June 1975 tax position of a married man with no dependent ohildren and with no other allowances.   Levels of taxationhave not in any way influenced the level of salaries we have recommended andwill vary, of oourBe, for individuals depending on their own tax situation andon the level of taxation at any particular time.   Nevertheless, our recommendations will inevitably be the subject of muoh public comment, and it is right - in ourview - that suoh comment should be made in the light of knowledge of the likelyeffects of taxation on the salary levels that we recommend.Ministerial pay struoture71.   Prior to our 1971 review, four levels of Balary existed for Ministerialappointments: Cabinet Ministers (together with oertain senior Ministers outsidethe Cabinet and oertain Ministers of State)I other senior Ministers (inoludingsome Ministers of State); other Ministers of State; and Junior Ministers(Parliamentary Secretaries and Under SeoretarieB of State).   As a result ofthat review we conoluded1 that Cabinet Ministers and Junior Ministers were well-defined classes of Ministerial appointment for which fixed salary levels1 Review Body on Top Salaries. First Report! Ministers of the Crown and Membersof Parliament - Cmnd. 4836 (paragraph 97).
CONFIDENTIALcontinued to be appropriate.   But we found that the intermediate levels of appointment formed a less well-defined group covering a wide range of responsibilities.   We reoommended for this group a broad salary range of 7)500 to  9,500.   These limits were intended to oorrespond to the higherand lower levels of intermediate responsibility, and the range was intendedto provide a measure of flexibility in relation to the salary levels appropriate for individual appointments within the group.72.   Our recommendation was implemented but, in practice, the Ministers coveredby it have since been paid at one or the other limit of the range.   For our part, we would still consider it appropriate for the system of a salary rangefor this group of Ministers to be implemented.   It is not, of course, for us tosuggest which individual Ministerial appointments Bhould be paid at particularlevels within the range.   Nevertheless, it may be helpful to give some indication of the approach underlying our recommendation.   We envisage as a generalguideline that the upper limit of the range should be reserved for senior ministers outside &quot;the Cabinet: that ie, senior Ministers who hold responsibilityfor specific areas of work within a Department of State or who hold appointmentsthat carry the same status.   We also consider that a somewhat narrower salaryrange would be more appropriate than a simple up-dating of our 1971 recommendations would provide.   We have allowed for this in our recommendations.Ministers73.   We are satisfied that a three-tier pay structure for Ministers oontinuesto be appropriate (paragraphs 71&quot;72).   At the upper end of the structure,we consider that the salary of Cabinet Ministers ought to be brought up todate, but that revaluation by referenoe to changes in the weight of responsibilityis not called for at this stage: after taking account of the other considerationsthat we have described, we oonclude that a salary of  18,000 a year is appropriate in June 1975 terms.   On the assumption that our earlier recommendation of a parliamentary salary of  5,000 is implemented, this would provide a recommended&quot;total salary of  23,000.74.   At the lower end of the Ministerial structure, we do not consider thatmajor revaluation is neoessary for Junior Ministers, but we consider it important to establish a proper relationship with the salary ( 8,000) that30
we recommended for MPs in our earlier report.   It is clearly right for Junior Ministers to have a salary lead over the remuneration of back--hench MPs and this applies equally to Junior Ministers in the House ofLords who do not receive the Parliamentary salary.   Furthermore, insofar asthe movement in outside earnings at oomparable levels of salary between April1972 and June 1975 is one indicator to whioh we have some regard, it clearlysupports a relatively greater increase than would be appropriate at higherlevels of salary.   In the light of these considerations, we see a salary of 8,500 a year as appropriate for Junior Ministers; this provides a recommendedtotal salary for Junior Ministers in the House of Commons of  13,500 - againassuming implementation of our recommended Parliamentary salary of  5,000.75.   The salaries for Ministerial appointments in the middle group of the structure should continue to be derived from within a range, and we have indicated our own view on the type of appointment for which the maximum ofthe salary range would be appropriate (paragraph 72).   We consider that the range should be  11,000- 13,000 a year, whioh would produce recommended totalsalaries ranging from  16,000 to  18,000 a year.Reoonimandati on-   We recommend the following annual salaries as appropriate to ministers of the Crown, in June 1975 terms:Ministerial salaryTotal salary 23,000 Cabinet Ministers18,000Senior Ministers notmaximum13,00011,00018,00016,000in the Cabinet/Ministers of StateminimumParliamentary Secretariesand Under secretaries of State8,50013,500Note: (a)   Including the Parliamentary salary recommended inour Report No 7 for Ministers who are Membersof the House of Commons.31
Prime Minister76.   The present salary of the Prime Minister is  20,000 (of which  5,000is free of tax) and the Parliamentary salary is  3,000, giving a current totalsalary of  23,000.   No revaluation is called for on this occasion and weconsider VnsA &quot;the appropriate salary for -the tjffioe of Prime Minister 1b 25,000.   Together with our recommended Parliamentary salary of  5,000, thiswill give a total salary of  30,000.77.   The tax-free element in the Prime Ministor*s salary recognises thespecial expenses, not defrayed out of Votes, vhich neoeBsarily accompanythis unique office.   Measured against the rise in costs and prices sinceApril 1972, the tax-free element of  5f000 which was accepted as right thenis no longer adequate, and we consider that it should now be increased to 6,000.RarirmmandatioS..   He recommend that the annual salary of the Prime minister should be  25,000 (providing a total salary of  30,000), of which  6,000should be free of tax in recognition of the special expenses of the office.Mr Speaker78.   The salary of the Speaker of the House of Commons is currently thesame as the salary of a Cabinet Minister ( 13i000 plus the parliamentary salary).   He endorsed this as an appropriate relationship in our 1971 review \and we take the same view now.79.   The salary of Mr Speaker, like that of the Prime Minister, contains a tax-free element in recognition of the special expenses, not defrayed outof Votes, of the office.   The current tax-free element is  4,000,   He considerit appropriate for the tax-free element to be increased to  5,000,Reo ommendati ofi.   We recommend that the annual salary of Mr Speaker shouldbe  18,000 (providing a total salary of  23,000), of which  5,000 should be free of tax in recognition of the special expenses of the offioe.Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report: Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament - Cmud, 4836 (paragraph 109).32
80.   The salary of the Lord Chancellor is currently  20,000 a year, of Khioh 2,500 recognises his function as Speaker of the House of Lords.81,   in our 1971 review, we noted that the office of Lord Chancellor is uniquein that it combines the function of Head of the Judioiary with the Ministerialduties of a Cabinet Minister^.   This oontinues to be so.   He recognised in1971 that, in judging the appropriate level of salary, account had to be taken of both judicial and ministerial salaries, but we were of the opinion thatthe burden of the Lord Chanoellor*8 functions had become increasingly Ministerialin nature,82,   He returned to this issus in our Report on Top Salaries   following ourReview of the pay in the four areas of the public services that are within ourstanding terms of reference.   In considering the pay of the most senior levels of&quot;the higher judiciary, naturally we had to have regard to the position of theLord Chancellor as overall head of the judiciary and, while we confirmed that&quot;the level of Ministerial salaries must have a bearing on the salary of theLord Chancellor, we recognised that it would be wrong for the largely politicalconstraints on the level of Ministerial salaries to act as an artifioial restraintto a sensible judicial salary structure.   Our recommendations for the salaries of High Court Judges and more senior judicial appointments (some 100 appointmentsin all) consequently exceeded the salary of  20,000 then (and now) paid to theLord Chancellor; however, the staging of the implementation of our recommendationshas meant that 14 only of those appointments are as yet paid more than theLord Chancellor.   He noted also that it would be necessary for this issue tobe considered in the next review of Ministerial pay.83.   We have found this to be one of the more difficult issues with whioh wehave had to deal in our consideration of Ministers&quot; salaries.   Clearly, as theLord Chancellor has a dual role, both Ministerial and judicial pay levels must continue to be taken into account in assessing the salary of the office.   But wehave given further consideration to the relative importance of Ministerialand judicial functions in the light of the evidence given to us both in thecourse of the review of judicial salaries and in relation to our present remit;^ Review Body on Top Salaries. First Report: Ministers of the Crown and Membersof Parliament - Cmnd, 4836 (paragraph 99).Review Body on Top Salaries, Report Mo 6: Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd. 5646(paragraphs 89-90),33
and, we have concluded that the constitutional position of the Lord Chancelloras Head of the Judiciary is of prime importance.   In this capacity, the LordChancellor has the sensitive role of providing a link between the independentjudiciary and Government and as such his judicial function must influence hisfunction as a Cabinet Minister.   It is right therefore that, while the LordChancellor^ salary should not be determined in isolation from ministerial salaries in general, it should be pitched at a level relative to the judicialpay structure that confirms the position of the offioe vis-a-vis the judioiary.84.   We consider that the appropriate salary for the Lord Chancellor in June1975 terms is  27,000,   This provides parity with the salary recommended in our report on Top Salaries for the Lord Chief Justice (whose current salary is 23,050 because of the staged implementation of our recommendations).85.   We have again considered the element in the Lord Chancellor*s salarythat should be attributed to his function as Speaker of the House of Lords.Cur 1971 recommendations changed the balance of the two elements from  4,000out of  14,500 to the present  2,500 out of  20,000.   We oonclude that thepresent apportionment of the salary between the two functions remains broadlyright and that the element that recognises the Lord Chancellors function asSpeaker of the House of Lords should now be  3,500,Rennmnandation.   We recommend that the annual salary of the Lord chancellor should be  27,000, including  3,500 to be paid in recognition of his functionas Speaker of the House of Lords,Law Officers86.   A comparable problem arises over the salaries of the four Law Officers,They, too, have a dual function, but to a lesser extent than in the case of theLord Chancellor.   Nevertheless, it remains important to assess the Law Officers&apos;salaries in relation both to Ministerial pay and to professional earnings atthe Bars in England and Wales and in Scotland,   In our 1971 review we aooeptedthat the salaries should be suoh as to emphasise the importance of the offioesin the eyes of the legal profession in each country and thus to attract lawyersof the right quality to Parliament, and that the salaries therefore should notbe too far out of line with current professional earnings1.   It was also olear1 Review Body on Top Salaries. First Report! Ministers of the Crown and Membersof Parliament - Cmnd, 4836 (paragraphs 101 -102).34CONFIDENTIAL
&quot;to us, however, that a satisfactory relationship with Ministerial salarieshad. to be established, and our reoommendations at that time narrowed the differential between the salaries of the Attorney General and of cabinet ministers.87.   The general principles that we established in 1971 remain valid now.   Butwe consider it right to narrow still farther the differential between the salaries of the Attorney General and of Cabinet Ministers.   He regard a salary of 19,000 as appropriate for the Attorney General against the recommended salary of  18,000 for Cabinet Ministers.   With the recommended Parliamentary salary of  5,000, this provides a total salary of  24,000 for the Attorney General,which in turn provides an appropriate relationship to current professionalearnings.88.   The salaries of the Solicitor General and the Lord Advocate are currentlythe same and, at  11,000, lie between the top of the range for the middlegroup of Ministers and the salary of Cabinet Ministers.   He consider thatthese two offices should continue to be paid equally, and that the samebroad relationship to other Ministerial salary levels should be maintained.Against  19,000 recommended for the Attorney General, we consider  15,000to be appropriate for both the Solicitor General and the Lord Advocate: withthe addition of the recommended Parliamentary salary, this will provide realistictotal salaries when measured against current professional earnings.89.   The current salary of the Solicitor General for Scotland is  7,750.It has been represented strongly to us that this is an inadequate reflectionof the responsibilities and status of the job.    We agree with this view.When we recommended the present salary in 1971, the information then availableto us on current professional earnings pointed to  7,750 as an appropriatesalary level.   We have since learned that earnings at the Soottish Bar increased substantially shortly thereafter, as the fees in operation at that time hadbeen unchanged for up to ten years.   In practioe, we have been told that theywere increased by 68 per oent overall shortly after the end of 1971 and bya further 28 per cent in 1974, with consequent effects upon the levels of professional earnings.   Our attention has alBo been drawn to the fact thatthe salary of Advocate-Deputes, who are responsible to the Solicitor general for Sootland, is  9,000 for a part-time commitment to publio offioe whioh doesnot prevent them from undertaking private practioe.   Furthermore, it seemsto have beoome established praotioe that the Solicitor General for scotland is not a Member of Parliament and, in consequence, he does not reoeive theParliamentary salary (neither, of course, does he have the constituency duties35CONFIDENTIAL
&quot;that the Parliamentary salary recognises).   We understand that one effectof the absence of constituency duties is that additional work and responsibilityof a Ministerial character tends to fall on the Solicitor General for Scotland.90.   The evidence put to us clearly indicates that the current salary of 7(750 seriously undervalues the office and, in retrospect, we take the viewthat our 1971 recommendation of that salary was - even at that time - pitohedtoo low.   In the light of all the circumstances, we consider that the salary of the Solicitor General for Scotland should be increased to  13,000.Recomendat^nTi-   We recommend that the salaries of the Law Offioers should be:Attorney GeneralSolicitor GeneralLord AdvocateSolicitor General for ScotlandNotes: (a)   Including the Parliamentary balary reoommended in our report No 7 for Ministers and other paid offioe holderswho are Members of the House of Commons.(b)   The present Solicitor General for Scotland, like anumber of his predecessors, is not a Member of Parliament.Other offioe holders91.   Certain other paid offices in both the House of Lorde and the House ofCommons fall within our remit.   They range from the Leader of the opposition in both Houses to Opposition Whips in the House of Commons.   Before we considerthe paid offices in detail, we make three general points.   First, we do notconsider that there is a case for a general revaluation of the offices concernedalthough some revaluation of individual offices is necessary.   In generaltherefore, we have aimed to bring salaries up to date against the same criteriaas we have applied to Ministerial salaries (paragraphs 64-66).   Seoond, theissue of different total salaries for office holders who are Membera of theHouse of Commons and those who are Members of the House of Lords again arises)we have already made clear our views on this problem (paragraphs 67-69).

CONFIDENTIALwe have considered the number of paid offices.   Representations have beenmade to us that it should be increased: some 23 par cent of the Members ofParliament who responded to our questionnaire suggested that certain additionaloffices should be paid: these include additional Opposition Whips, Opposition^spokesmen and Chairmen or members of Select Committees or Standing Committees .We take the view, however, that the present range of paid offices meets theneeds of Parliament and that it should not be extended at this time: indeed,w% -take the view that it should be reduoed in one instanoe.   We have also given careful consideration to the suggestions that were put to us for paying theleaders of other opposition parties in Parliament.   But we continue to see, atany rate for the present, a clear distinction in Parliamentary terms betweenthe Leader of the Opposition, as the leader most likely to be called upon toProvide an alternative Government, and the leaders of minority opposition parties.We have also taken into account the fact that, since 1 January 1975, provision has been made from public funds for financial assistance to opposition parties on the basis of a formula related to the number of seats hold and the numberof votes received: this arrangement will have helped the position of leaders ofminority parties to some extent.the  Leader of the Opposition      the Houp&quot; &quot;f nr&quot;T&quot;&quot;le92.   We have given consideration to the office of the Leader of the Opposition:the current salary of  9,500 equates to the inatimum of the current salaryrange for the middle group of Ministers.   Maintenance of that parity in ourPresent recommendations would provide a salary of  13,000.   In our view thetime has come when it would be more appropriate to pay the Leader of theOpposition, as the most likely alternative Priiie Minister, a salary somewhatabove the top of the range for the middle group of Ministers, but below the salary 0f a Cabinet Minister.   We propose an annual salary of  14,000 for the leader of the Opposition.Opposition WMpa93.

For the remaining paid offices in the House of Lords only ageneral up-dating of salaries is called for.Recommendation.

One or two points on the working of the optional supplementary schemahave been brought to cur attention.   The present provisions allow newly-appointed Masters or office holders 3 months i* which to decide whether or.__      T+ van been suffltested that this time limitnot to participate in the scheme.

CONFIDENTIAL98.   The position under the supplementary Boheme of Ministers and other paidoffice holders in the House of Lords has also given rise to some difficulty.   Itis a requirement of the basic Parliamentary pension scheme that members must serve a period of four years before they have any entitlement to a pension.   Aperiod of qualifying service is a basic requirement in all pension schemes.The same limitation applies to the supplementary scheme, but Ministers and, offioe holders who are (or have been) Members of Parliament can reckon their previous service in the House of Commons towards the qualifying period of fouryears.   Those who have no such service consequently have to serve as a minister or office holder for the full four years before they become entitled to a pension,although their contributions may be refunded if they cease to participate in the supplementary soheme before oompletion of the qualifying period.   It has beensuggested to us that four years is an unduly long qualifying period in the context of Ministerial or other appointment, and that a shorter period should beapplied to Ministers and offioe holders to allow for the position of thosewho are Members of the House of Lords.99.   We have some sympathy for this point of view.   We have already indicated(paragraph 46) that we do not oonsider it appropriate to extend to the supple-mentary scheme the provisions for the optional purchase of added years that wehave recommended for introduction into the basic soheme for Members of Parliament.Such an extension would give those Ministers and office holders who are Membersof the House of Commons the opportunity to purchase added years in respect ofboth their jobs.   In our view, this would not be proper.   But we have considered whether it would possible to provide for the position of Ministers and offioeholders who are Members of the House of Lords by recommending a shorter periodof qualifying service for pension entitlement in relation to the supplementary scheme than the 4 years that currently applies.   Such an arrangement would makelittle or no difference to Ministers and offioe holders who are Members of theHouse of Commons as, in the great majority of oases, their previous service as MPs would count for this purpose.   But it oould be of advantage to thosein the House of Lords.   We reoognise the difficulties inherent in this ooursstthe basic qualifying period of 4 years in recognition of the peculiar natureof Parliamentary employment, is in itself more favourable than applies generally.But we believe that for this purpose, a qualifying period of 3 years would be acceptable.   We make no specific recommendation at this time, but we suggestthat the possibility of introducing such an arrangement should be examined further,40
* CONFIDENTIAL100,   We have considered whether the ill-health retirement arrangements thatwe have recommended for Members of Parliament (paragraph 49) Bhould also beapplied to the supplementary scheme for Ministers and office holders.   We have concluded that the service enhancement arrangements would not be appropriate for the same reason as we have not recommended an extension of the added yearsprovisions (paragraph 99).   But it would be right for a limited benefit to apply,aad we propose that, subject to satisfying the requirements of the ill-healtharrangements reoommended for Members, participants in the supplementary sohemeshould be entitled to immediate payment of their pension entitlement accrued todate as Ministers or office holders.RecommftTiflatipn. We recommend that Ministers or office holders who are obliged*o retire early on grounds of ilWiealth should reoeive immediate payment of the pension entitlement accrued to date under the supplementary soheme, subject tothe other requirements of the ill-health retirement arrangements for Members ofParliament being met.   This arrangement will also apply to former Mini stars oroffice holders who are no longer in offioe but who have a pension entitlementur&quot;ier -the supplementary scheme.101.   Statutory pensions are attached to the offioes of the Prime Minister,Mr Speaker and the Lord Chancellor.   The current levels of pensions, following0011 1971 recommendations, are:Prime Minister  7,500Mr Speaker  6,500Lord Chancellor  8,500He suggested in our First report that consideration should be given in the future to fixing each statutory pension as a percentage of the salary of the offioe,thereby removing the need to reoonsider the amount each time the salary is revised.The Parliamentary and other Pensions Aot 1972 (section 29) puts this recommendationinto effect.   The Parliamentary and other Pensions and Salaries Bill currentlybefore the House of Commons further provides that the statutory pensions oouldalso be paid in relation to a notional salary for pension purposes, aB for MPs-and Ministers&apos; pensions,102.   The statutory pensions are very different in oonoept from normal pensionarrangements.   They are payable on leaving the relevant office, irrespective ofthe length of service in it.   On the other hand, holders of the three offioeslose entitlement to participate in the normal Parliamentary scheme (our 1971 --------------Review Body on Top Salaries.

recommendation&apos; that, where appropriate, they should he allowed to continueparticipation in the basic Parliamentary scheme was not put into effect).Furthermore, by well-established convention, former Lord Chancellors do not return to practice at the Bar and, by custom, former Speakers of the House ofCommons do not return to the backbenches for more than a minimal period.   Formerftlae Ministers may return to the backbenches but, if they acoept thestatutory pension when they leave offioe, they are entitled only to theParliamentary salary of a Minister and not to the full salary of a Memberof Parliament.103.   The existing arrangements applied to the salary recommendations that we put forward will provide the following statutory pensions:Prime Minister   9*375Mr Speaker * 9,000Lord Chancellor  11,475Wo consider that these levels of statutory pension are reasonable and that nofurther recommendation on our part is necessary at this stage.The effaots of taxation104.   We have already explained (paragraph 70) our purpose in referring to oursalary recommendations in net-of-tax terms.   We think it right that the recommendedsalaries should not be judged entirely in isolation from the effects of taxation,although the assumptions we have made in arriving at pos-Wtax figures are perforcearbitrary and individual tax positions may, of course, vary quite widely.Nevertheless, our figures provide some indication of the likely impact oftaxation.   On this basis, the salaries that we now reoommend will produoa thefollowing levels of net annual salary:Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report: Ministers of the Crown and Membersof Parliament - Cmnd. 4836 (paragraph 119).42

CHAPTER 5: SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONS AMD RECOMMENDATIONS105.   We have dealt with a number of questions that relate to the allowancesaai facilities for Members of Parliament and that were left over from our report No 7; with the Parliamentary pension scheme; and with the pay and pensions of Ministers and paid office holders in both Houses of Parliament.   We shall be putting forward our recommendations on the Peers&quot; expenses allowanoe separately.106.   Chapter 2 of this report deals with the remaining issues on the allowances and facilities available to Members of Parliament.   The recommendations on allowances^ facilities in our Report No 7 have been implemented in full, and we have now considered whether the inaximum of the secretarial allowance should be furtherleased to provide for occupational pension arrangements and for general officeexpenses.   We have concluded that, in present circumstances, a higher maximumshould not be introduced for these purposes: the present maximum makes provisionfo* a Members contribution as an employer to the State pension scheme (paragraph 15).Nor do we regard it as appropriate to increase the maximum of the allowance to providefor general office expenses.   Such expenses are an inescapable part of ourParliamentary system, and can arise whether or not a Member employs a secretary.have concluded that separate provision for them should be made and we have^commended a new allowance to assist with the initial and maintenance costs ofSeaaral office equipment, with a maximum of  300 during any period of 3 years,payment of claims to be conditional upon evidence of expenditure (paragraph 16).107.   The present maximum of the additional costs allowance remains adequate, inour view, to meet the occasional need for a Member to attend at Westminster00 Parliamentary business during a Parliamentary recess (paragraph 17).   But we^vs recommended an extension of the travel arrangements for Members so that*W cost of all travel within the United Kingdom on Parliamentary business will* reimbursed or will qualify for payment of the car mileage allowanoe (paragraph 19).* have also recommended that the free telephone and postage facilities at westminster should be extended to apply to communications on Parliamentary business*ith other countries of the European Economic Community (paragraph 21).108. we have examined the arrangements for payment of a grant equivalent to3 months&quot; salary to Members who lose their seat at a general election or becauseof constituency boundary changes.   Against the background that Members are now44
CONFIDENTIALbecoming eligible for the standard forms of Bhort-term assistance in such circumstances, we consider that the existing severance arrangements remainadequate, although we recommend that a grant under these arrangements should beavailable only as an alternative to redundancy payments in any circumstances where a Member becomes eligible for such payments (paragraph 24).In Chapter 3 we discuss the existing provisions for the pensions payable to Members of Parliament.   We have again reviewed carefully the position of Memberswbo retired prior to the introduction of the present form of pension scheme inOctober 1964.   But we have felt unable ourselves to recommend that these members should be entitled to any benefit under the Parliamentary pension scheme (paragraph33).   We suggest, however, that the possibility of a limited provision forsuch Members at age 80 might be given further consideration (paragraph 34).   Werecommend that the maximum amount of service prior to October 1964 that may be&quot;treated as reckonable for pension purposes by serving Members should be extendedfrom 10 to 15 years (paragraph 35)* this extension Bhould apply only to Members whonave service in the House of Commons after the effective date of implementation of our recommendation.110.    We do not accept the argument for a faster rate of accrual of pension entitlement for Members (paragraph 38), but we reconmend a number of changes inthe Parliamentary pension scheme that together will provide a substantial improvementin the pensions arrangements for Members.   We recomnend an increase to 4 per centxn the rate of interest payable on returned contributions (paragraph 41); theintroduction of an arrangement for the optional purchase by Members of added yearsof reckonable service (paragraph 46); the introduction of a facility for earlyretirement on grounds of ill-health (subject to medical evidence) with immediatePayment of pension accrued to date and enhanced in certain cases (paragraph 49)ja similar arrangement, but without enhancement of pension entitlement, should applyto former Members who have a &quot;frozen1 pension entitlement that would not normallyPayable until age 65 (paragraph 49).   We also recommend improvements in widows&apos;Pensions (paragraph 55) so that the enhancement arrangements recommended for ill-health retirements will also apply to the pension of the widow of a Member who dies in service; the short--term arrangement for financial assis-tance in -the early months ofWidowhood will be improved considerably; clarification of the governing legislation80 that the pension of the widow of a retired Member who opted for early retirement0n an actuarially-reduced pension will be based on the Member&apos;s full pension; andlD1Provements in the arrangements for payment of the death-in-service gratuity.45
CONFIDENTIAL111.   We do not consider that the present normal retirement age of 65 shouldhe reduced (paragraph 57), hut we have examined the existing provisions for earlyretirement on immediate payment of pension.   The present arrangement which requiresan actuarial reduction of pension entitlement should continue and, in addition,we recommend the introduction of an additional early retirement option under which&quot;the pension entitlement accrued to date may be paid without actuarial reductionfor Members who retire at age 62 or over at the end&apos; of a Parliament and subjectto the completion of 25 years* service as a Member (paragraph 57).112.   He estimate that the cost of our recommended improvements in Members1pension arrangements will necessitate an increase in the total contribution payableinto the Pension Pond of rather more than 1-f- per oent of the pensionable salary of aMember.   Some 1 per cent will be needed to fund the improvements in respect ofthe past service of serving Members and we recommend that this part of the oostshould be met from public funds.   The balance in respect of current* oosts shouldbe met by an increase in the contribution of each Member.   We consider that thesecostings and the improvements in the scheme bring the   Parliamentary pensionarrangements sufficiently close to contributory soheraes elsewhere in the public services as to justify an increase in the Members1 contribution to 6 per oent ofpensionable salary (paragraphs 58-60).113.   In Chapter 4 we consider the salaries and pension arrangements applicableto Ministers and other paid office holders in both Houses of1 Parliament.   We detail the general background factors that we have borne in mind in arriving at oursalary recommendations (paragraphs 64-66), and we conclude that a differentialbetween the salaries attached to the offices of Ministers and other office holderswho are Members of the House of Commons and those who are Members of the Houseof Lords is not justified and oannot be reoommended (paragraphs 67-69),114.   We consider that a three*-tier pay structure for Ministerial appointmentsremains appropriate, with a continuation of a flexible salary range for the group of Ministers at the intermediate level (paragraphs 71-72).   Our salary recommendations for Ministers are in paragraph 75.115.   tfe recommend an increase in the salary of the Prime Minister and in theamount of his salary that is paid free of tax in recognition of the specialexpenses of the office (paragraph 77),   We also recommend an increase in the salary of Mr Speaker, and in the tax-free element within that salary (paragraph 79).46
116.   We have found the conaiderations affecting the salary of the Lord chancellor to be among the more difficult that we have had to deal with in the course of this review.   We have concluded that, while the Lord Chancellor^ salary should not bedetermined in isolation from Ministerial salaries in general, it should be pitchedat a level relative to the judicial pay structure that confirms the position anddignity of the office vis-a-vis the judiciary (paragraph 83).   We recommend the appropriate salary and the amount within it to be paid in recognition of theLord Chancellor^ function as Speaker of the House of Lords (paragraph 85).We recommend salaries for the four Law Officers that narrow further the salary differential between the Attorney General and Cabinet Ministers, thatretain equal salaries for the Solicitor General and the Lord Advocate, and thatreflect a correction of the substantial undervaluation of the office of solicitor general for Scotland (paragraph 90).Revised salaries for other paid office holders in both Houses of Parliament are recommended (paragraphs 93-94).   The recommendations include a measure ofrevaluation of the offices of Leader of the Opposition in both Housee (paragraphs 92^d 94), and the discontinuation from the end of the current Parliament of thePresent salary for a third Opposition Whip in the House of Commons; the OppositionChief Whip and the Opposition Deputy Chief Whip continue to be paid offices(paragraph 93).119.   We have considered the working of the supplementary pension scheme for*iniBters and paid office holders.   We suggeBt further examination of the time limit of 3 months for a Minister or office holder to decide whether or not toParticipate in the supplementary scheme (paragraph 97).   We do not considerit appropriate to extend the added years arrangement to the supplementary schemefor Ministers and office holders, but we suggest for further examination thePossibility of a shorter basic qualifying period of service for that scheme(paragraph 99).     We recommend a more limited ill-health retirement benefit for application to the supplementary scheme (paragraph 100).12o*   We have considered the statutory pensions attached to the offices of theprime Minister, Mr Speaker and the Lord Chancellor.   The statutory arrangements now provide for each pension to be fixed as a percentage of the salary of theoffice.    The levels of pensions thus produced from our Balary recommendations forthe three offices are adequate and no separate reoommendation is needed(paragraphs 101-103).47
121,   We have explained (paragraphs 6-7) that the recommendations whichwe now put forward will he affected to varying degrees by the current payrestraint measures and they will also be affected by the pay policy arrangements under the recently published guidelines that are intended to operate from Augustof this year,122,   Finally, we should like to emphasise one or two of the points that wehave made elsewhere in this report.   We recognise that the levels of salarywhich we recommend will be the subject of widespread public comment.   the pay of Ministers and Members of Parliament does not form part of our standingterms of reference, but there are good reasons for referring -the issue to anindependent body.   Ministers and Members occupy positions of great responsibility and influence in the conduct of our national business.   They, like those who are within our standing terms of reference and those who are within the fields of-the other two independent Review Bodies, form a group to whi/ia tha process of pay negotiation does not apply.   In our view, the salary levels appropriate inthis situation Bhould continue to be judged against all the relevant circumstances,both in relation to the jobs themselves and in relation to external factors, byan independent body such as wa are, responsible direct to the Prime Minister.We think it timely, in the light of recent comments on the nature of the commitment to accept our recommendations, to repeat that, on our appointment in 1971 as one of three Review Bodies, wa were given an assurance that our recommendationsl-ould be accepted by the Government unless there were clear and compellingreeaana for theiT not doing bo.   ^bie awrarante -was repeated in 191 A.123.   The increases that we now recommend are broadly consistent with the soaleof increases in salaries generally, at comparable levels of income, over thePeriod in question.   That period is the key: &quot;the increases now appropriate (and,we repeat, the salaries that we reoomraend are those that were appropriate as at13 June 1975) appear to be large because of the long interval since the last reviewof Parliamentary and Ministerial remuneration in 1971-72.   We take the opportunityto reiterate the recommendation on this point that we made in Report No 7 : thatReview Body on Top Salaries, Report No 7* Ministers of the Crown and Members ofParliament and the Peers&quot; expenses allowance: Part I - Cmnd. 6136 (paragraph 27),48.

*5 CONFIDENTIALSUHVBX OP THE CIRCUMSTANCES OP MEMBERS OP PARLIAMENT AMD OP THEIR VIEWS ONTHBIR REMUNERATIONIntroduction1*   Questionnaires were sent to all 635 Members of Parliament on 7 March1975 for return by 1 April 1975, and 445 Members responded.    The responserate was high (70 per cent) but not as high as in the 1971 survey1 whenit was 84 per cent.    The response from office holders was very much lower than in 1971, but the decline in the number of replies from other Memberswas leas.2.    The questionnaires returned were in general adequately completed butdifficulty arose in interpreting the period to be covered for certainexpenditure in relation to the October 1974 election.   The questionnaireasked that only expenditure during the current Parliament (from October1974) to the end of February T975 should be included, but it was apparent that many MPs had included a full year&apos;s expenditure.   Various sources ofinformation were used to put the resultB as far as possible on to a consistent basis of an expected annual rate of expenditure based on actualdays of attendance at the House.   There were also differences in treatmentof hours spent on departmental work between different office holders(see footnote (b) to Table 15).3.   The questionnaire itself is not reproduced in this Appendix but theorder and wording of the tables closely reflects it.   There were variations in the response rate to different questions: these are shown in the tables.Inevitably, the replies were influenced to some extent by the nature of thequestions and must be interpreted accordingly.   For example, Table 23 shows the response to three speoific questions about the pensions soheme; the modifications mentioned in this question inevitably attracted much moresupport than was given to any of the other suggestions for improvement tothe pension scheme that were offered in response to a general question(Table 24).   Similarly many more Members made proposals in answer to thequestion about the intervals between adjustments and review of MPq&apos;^ All references to 1971 in this Appendix relate to the survey of MPs*circumstances and views on their remuneration carried out in 1971 by theOffice of Manpower Economics on behalf of the Review Body on Top Salaries-The results were summarised in the Review Body1 a First Report, Appendix A(Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report: Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament -Cmnd. 48361 December 1971).
remuneration (Table 25) than volunteered additional comments or proposals in response to a final general question (Table 27).4*   The response to the invitation to put forward comments or proposalsalso varied: some MPs did not reply, but others made more than one commentor proposal and these are analysed separately within the same table where appropriate.   Where necessary, replies have been transferred to a more appropriate question (for example, particular proposals from a general question to the appropriate specific one).5.    Between February and October 1974 the Government had no overallParliamentary majority and only a small one at the time of survey in 1975,whereas the majority in 1971 was larger.    The hours of work and perhaps the levels of expenditure in the 1975 survey by comparison with those inthe 1971 survey may have been affected (although the extent oannot be measured)by the different Parliamentary situations and pressures on attendance inthose two years.6.   Account was taken of the results of the survey in considering therecommendations on pay, allowances and facilities put forward in the first part of this Report in June 1975, which have since been implemented on thebasis described in Chapter 1 above.7.

Furthermore,Members to attend Westminster occasionally s .      . *   ,.th tn Members are not restricted to thetlve travel facilities available to MemoesPQriod of a Parliamentary session.iv)   Iravel Facilities,    (para 19) ., .&quot;tr v 1 withil^io^l orders is a facility co^only available to***r European and Commonwealth Parliamentarians, and frequently mor professional life.   Members travel costs are at present
reimbursed for,journeys between Westminster, home and constituency;within the constituency;    and to central or local government authorialconnected with the constituency but located outside the boundaries,report recommends that Members should be reimbursed,  or qualify forcar   mileage allowance, for all travel within the United Kingdom, on parliamentary business, in order to inform themselves on subjectsdirectly relevant to the work of Parliament, or the interests of theirconstituents.v) Postage and Telephone Costs    (para 21)Members are provided with free postage from Westminster to destinationwithin the United Kingdom for Parliamentary business,  and telephonecalls from the House, within the United Kingdom,  are similarly free.The facilities are considered adequate and an extension of the facilit,to Members&apos; homes or constituencies would be inappropriate.    Anextension of facilities from the House is however recommended to applyto communications with other e.c. countries on Parliamentary business.vi) Severance Arrangements    (para 24)Since April  1975 Members have been reclassified for national insurancepurposes,  and may be eligible to receive redundancy payments in theevent of losing a seat as a result of reorganization of constituenciesThe report therefore recommends that the grant under severancearrangements should be available only as an alternative to redundancy payments. depending on individual circumstances, otherwise the severanarrangements should be unchanged.confidential
C0KFI22X2IAL^cqmmzxd^ions on kskbshs1 and kikistshs&apos; psxsiohsi) Inclusion of Members who retired prior to the implementation o.fthe scheme   (para J4)At present, Members who retired before October 1964 and who have nosubsequent service in the House of Corona are not entitled to anyWefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Pension ?und.   Despite*&amp;e small numbers involved, the Review Body considers that the prin-ci?le of no retrospection is an important one, and recommends no cha--ethe present arrangements.   However, the Review Body suggests thePossibility that some benefit, in parallel with the State pension^rangecents for the over-80&apos;s, should be iaade available as of rightto such Members when they reach ago 80.   It calces no recommendationbut considers that Parliament should decide.ii) Reckonable service before 1964 (para 35)present scheme provides for a maxima of 10 years&apos; service prior*o October 1964 to be counted by Members with service after that date,*fce Review Body does not think that all pre-19&amp;4 service should bo*9ckonable, but recommends that        maximm of such reckonable servicesWld be increased to 16 years for those with service after tho change4*- introduced, and that the cost should be met fron public funds.4ii)   Rate of accrual (para JS)?te Review Body notes the heavy cost that would be involved if the**te of accrual were to be faster.   It comments on the increasing1ikelihood that Members&apos; pensions will become preserved or transfer-*ble and notes the practice regarding accrual rates in other parts of
public sector in -chaK*e ia the Preseat *0 y6a:?accrual.iv)   Interest on refunded contributions, (para 41)Noting the concessionary tax levels on refunded contributions and that interest level on the refunds must have regard to the long-tesatrend of interest rates generally, the Review Body does not consideran increase in the rate of interest on refunded contributions to% level of current interest rates generally can be sustained, but  c^sends that the - ^ * t0       in * contributions made from a current date.y)  gurchase of added years    (para 46)Review Body recommends that pm^-inn should bo made f or^theEgSha.se of added years by those in service or subsequently serving.   -**chase aight be made by a lump sum within 12 months or by periodical^nts from salary.   ^ Review Body considers that, on the cessationQf service caused by death cr ill-health, the total number of years the contracted to buy should be reokonable for pensions purposes,inthat a Member who resumes a Parliamentary career after a break8e*VAce should be able to resume the purchase of added years at therate applied before the break in service.BstirftWAnt on grounds of ill-health (paras 49 and 100)9 Review Body recommends that provision should be made within thecWe for retirement on grounds of ill-health.   This should, includell^aaceaeat of reckonable service modelled on public service arrangementdelated to a retirement age of 65*   It should also include the2
iffliaQdiate payment or preserved pensionsy but without enhancement, tothose already retired who have to retire from their present employmonIt recommends that immediate payment of accrued entitlement under thoSupplementary Scheme should be made to Members of that Scheme forcedto retire early on grounds of ill-health.vii)   Widows^^and dependants1 pensions (para 55)^he Review Body recommends a number of improvements to the provision3Members1 widows and dependants.     These include ill-aealth enhancfcent of reckonable service when the Member dies in service, and thoPayment of widow&apos;s pension at the Member&apos;s full salary rate for tho*irst 3 months after his death.   The Review 3ody recommends that allthe widows&apos; benefits should be available to dependant widowers ofVoaea Members.via)   Early retirement option (para 57)Under existing arrangements a Member can retire early, under certaincircumstances, and receive an actuarially-reduced pension.   ThoReview Body does not consider that the retirement age of Memberse&amp;ould be reduced but recommends that, in addition to the present arrangements, a Member who is aged 62 and has completed 3 5 years&apos;Service should be able to retire with immediate payment of^unreduced ensi cm accrued to that date.ix)   Contribution rates (para 60)In order to help meet the cost of the improvements, the Review Body  commends that Members&apos; contributions should be increased from 5fa 0. 6% of pensionable salary.3
x)   Ministers&apos; pensions (paras 99 and 105)Vhile it considers provision for the purchase of added years^appropriate for extension to the Supplementary Scheme, theEeview Body suggests that the possibility of introducing a quali^ ing period of 3 years for that scheme - should be considered.Review Body meies recommendations for improvements in the salarieOf the Offices of Prtma Kinia^.
