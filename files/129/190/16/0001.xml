DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 41 COPY no. 5 July 1976CABINETCUTTING THE COST OF THE CIVIL SERVICE:ABOLITION OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Lord Privy Seal811. The paper CP(76) 39 sets out very clearly the difficulties weface in securing the saving of  140 million in staff costs in 1978-79 towhich we are pledged.    The agreed options total only  95 million.Abolition of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) offers a public expendituresaving of  34 million, and would leave us only  11 million more to find.2.        Without VED we must resort either to much of Annex X of cp(76) 39 or to an arbitrary cut across the board.    The implications of doing either are so serious that we regard it as essential that before reaching decisions on the manpower exercise the Cabinet re-examine thecase for abolishing VED.CONSEQUENCES OF ABOLITION3.        Abolition would reduce by 3, 000 the number of civil servantsneeded in 1978 to run the combined vehicle registration and dutycollecting system.   Annual vehicle registration would continue as a necessary support to road traffic law enforcement.    By abolishing VEDon petrol vehicles we would save  12 million a year in staff costs andthere would be a further credit of  22 million in the public expenditure figures through retention of a  2 fee for the vehicle registration.Collection of VED falls squarely into the category of extravagant usesof manpower; it costs 5p per pound of revenue.4.        The tax revenue of  625 million forgone by VED abolition would be equivalent to an increase of 15p a gallon in petrol duty which couldpresumably be collected without any additional cost.   Furthermore suchan increase in the price of petrol following the abolition of VED would,on recent Department of Energy estimates, save between  25 million and 35 million, a year on imported fuel and the effect on the Retail price index (RPI) should be neutral.1
TRANSPORT POLICY5.        The effects of abolishing VED are discussed in the Transport PolicyConsultation document published in March,    In transport policy terms anincrease in petrol coats would raise the perceived costs of motoring and put in perspective the increases in the cost of public transport, broughtabout by the decision to reduce revenue support subsidies.    It would mean that motorists paid for the actual use made of their cars, and paid moreas they added to congestion costs.MOTOR industry.        It is of course right to consider the possible implications ofabolition on the pattern of demand for new cars.    The Secretary of Statefor Industry fears that there would be particularly adverse effects on british Leyland&apos;e profitable production of Jaguars and Rovers, and thatthere would be a move down to smaller capacity cars which, in the absenceof adequate United Kingdom production, would pull in further imports.The view of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) during the earlier discussions in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy was thatthe tax change would cause a 1 per cent drop in the operating cost of theMini segment of the market and a rise of 1 per cent for a new mediumsized vehicle.    They concluded that abolition would have no more than amarginal effect on the structure of new demand.7.        A rise of 15p a gallon in the price of petrol is not of courseunprecedented.    In the 18 months from summer 1973, petrol rose from36p to 72p a gallon, an increase in real terms of 60 per cent.    Between1973 and 1975 the imported share of the new car market rose from27 per cent to 34 per cent (compared with 14 per cent in 1970); andpurchases of new cars under 1200 cc rose from 22 per cent to 29 per cent.It would be grossly misleading however to attribute these trends solely oreven mainly to the increases in petrol price.    As the CPRS have reported,the real cost of buying a car rose sharply after 1973 for the first time since the Korean War.    Moreover, whilst at the beginning of 1973 Britishcars were invariably cheaper than their principal competitors by fairlywide margins - 20 per cent or more - this price advantage has subsequentlydeclined or entirely disappeared.    In our view it is the cost of buying anew car and not the cost of running it which mainly determines the choice of model.8.        Our conclusion therefore is that the effects of abolition on demand would, at most, be marginal and minor and that fears for the United Kingdommotor industry are unjustified.    But in any case an early announcementof the intention to abolish VED, say in 1978, would provide the motor industry with the necessary period of time to increase the range of smallcars.  Certainly in the context of the  140 milllon-exercise, the cost of retaining3, 000 eivil servants seems to represent an addition to the substantial supportof the motor industry already provided by the British taxpayer which it isvery difficult to defend.2

PRESENTATIONAL ASPECTS OF ABOLITION9.        a.        VED is expensive to collect and unpopular with the law-abiding because it is so widely evaded (probably as high as  per cent ( 40 million a year)).b. The Driver Vehicle and Licensing Centre (and its local offices) has been particularly subject to charges of bureaucracyand attracted adverse publicity following criticisms by the public accounts Committee last Session.    Thus a staff saving in this sector would be recognised by the public as genuine.c. Recent disclosures In the Press mean that it is now widely accepted that the abolition of VED is the major option underconsideration.    The trade unions will judge our decisions on thisoption as the critical test of whether we intend to achieve the savings by actually cutting the work of Government.d. It should be possible to secure much of the saving without causing redundancy.   A third of the 3, 000 are not yet recruited.If a decision is taken quickly to abolish VED it will be possible,by the use of short term contracts using temporary staff, to achieve a phased rundown of employment over the next 18 months.There is a high turnover of the junior staff involved - currentlyabout 700 a year - which would be sufficient to dispose of theestimated surplus of non-mobile staff; redundant mobile staff would be dealt with as part of the redundancy arrangements forthe whole of the Department of the Environment.JOB OPPORTUNITIES10.       There will undoubtedly be some reduction of the job opportunities,mainly for young female labour, at the Driver Vehicle LicensingDepartment Headquarters in Swansea and this will be a matter of concern to the Secretary of State for Wales and the local communities.    But theloss of jobs at Swansea itself should be not more than 1, 000.    Theremainder will be spread throughout the country in 80 local offices whichshould assist in redeploying redundant staff.COSTING THE OPTIONU.        In CP(76) 39 the contribution of the VED option is counted as only 12 million.    This accords strictly with the Public Expenditure survey committee conventions.    It can however be argued that the  22 millionreceipts from the vehicle registration fee should nevertheless counttowards the  140 million.    It is after all the existence of the rule thatreceipts in such cases are an offset to public expenditure that has madethe achievement of the  140 million harder by putting established repaymentservices outside the exercise.    We do not see why we should lose both onthe swings and on the roundabouts.3
CONCLUSION12.       In our view, VED should be abolished from April 1978 and anannouncement to this effect made at the earliest date possible in orderto avoid unnecessary staff redundancies and to provide adequate notice to the motor industry.PSSDepartment of the Environment5 July 19764
