DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(76* 32 COPY NO     8114 June 1976CABINETPENSIONS INCREASE 1976Memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the ISSUEI.        in December this year over a million public service pensioner.w*U be eligible, under or by analogy with the Pension- Met 1971.to have their pensions increased by the percentage rise in the Retail prices index over the 12 months ending June 1976.   Apart from civil servants,they include Members of Parliament, teachers, the Armed Force-National Health Service and local government employees, police and firemen.    Broadly similar annual review arra^emente apply to manynationalised industry schemes (see Annex), although the review period and date of payment may differ.    This memorandum considers whether, thisyear.s Retail Price Index (RH) increase which could be of the order ofi3 - 14 per cent, should be modified for the better-off occupational pensioners in the light of the continuing policy of incomes restraint.background.        It was agreed last July by Ministers shortly after the current paylimits had been announced, that It would on balance be better not to bringthe issue of pensions into public debate by a step which involved legislation.Ministers had noted that no action had been taken to restrict pensions in the context of previous incomes policies and the question had at no time been raised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC).   It was agreed, therefore,that the increases in pensions due later in 1975 should not be restricted Inany way.3.        In the event, the 26 per cent pensions increase led to strong public criticism during the autumn and winter months in Hie Press and InParliament which was primarily directed towards the Civil Service.    I hadto give assurances that the inflation-proofing principle would be kept underreview and looked at in the context of the economic situation in 1976.1
4.        The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy have considered a paper by officials about the pensions Increase due mis year.    There was a clear majority in the Committee lor taking no modifying action this year,mainly because of the practical difficulties^   There was, however, somedisquiet In the Committee At the prospect of allowing the prospectiveincreases to go ahead unchecked, particularly for the batter-off pensioner,and it was agreed to report to Cabinet for final decision,ARGUMENTS FOR MODIFYING THE 1976 PENSIONS INCREASE5.        The situation today is different from that of a year ago.   last yearMinisters were able to defend the 26 per cent increase on the grounds thatit amounted in effect to the belated counterpart for pensioners of the bigwage round during the 12 months up to mid-1975.   Earnings during thecurrent 12 months have however been restricted to  6 a week with an absolute cut-off at  8, 500; during the next stage of the policy they willbe subject to an upper limit of  4 &amp; week.   Against that background thereare three main arguments for modifying the pensions Increase under thisyear&apos;s review:-1.      Equity suggests that the better-off occupational pensionersshould no longer continue to be Insulated from the decline in living standards at the middle and higher income levels amongthe working population.    The terms of service of people in ,employment have had to be abrogated by die pay policy.ii.       Underlying the criticism of the inflation-proofing arrange-menta has been the belief that, when most private sectoremployers cannot afford to protect their pensioners fully against inflation, it is wrong for public sector employers to do soapparently at the tax-payer&apos;s expense.    The fact that CivilService pay is reduced to the extent that Civil Service pensionarrangements axe better all round than those of their paycounterparts has not disarmed the critics.    Particular resentmenthas been expressed over pension increases which, though relatively few in number, have substantially exceeded the  6 a week pay limit,and, in a handful of cases, have exceeded  2,000 a year.    Renewedand even sharper criticism of the Government would doubtless beprompted by the payment this year of pension increases of up to 1, 500 from public funds at a time when the limit on earnings willbe  208 a year and the Government are looking for every economy in public expenditure.Hi.       There is the particular problem of &quot;overtaking&quot;.    Whenpay but not pensions is subject to restraint, the newly-retired get a progressively smaller pension compared with moss who retired from similar jobs in recent years and have the value oftheir pensions maintained against the cost of living.    For example,in the case of the Civil Service, the disadvantage for a Principalretiring at the end of this year will be up to over  500 and for aPermanent Secretary nearly  4, 000.    These difficulties could be substantially eased by modifying this year&apos;s pension increases.2
PRE-AWARD INFLATION-PROOFING6.       At the higher levels in the private sector and to some extent in the nationalised industry field, the &quot;overtaking1&apos; problem is being obviated bysupplementing actual retiring salary under a special feature of the InlandRevenue practice governing the approval of pension schemes.    This allowsa final notional salary to be determined for pension purposes, which canrange from:-i.       salary received during any one of the five years precedingretirement toii.      the average salary received during any three consecutiveyears in the last 13 yeaes before retirement.uplifted by increases in the RPI between the end of the period selected as above and the date of retirement.   A notional salary determined in thisway may be substantially in excess of the actual salary in payment.   Anystep to restrict inflation-proofing by modifying this year&apos;s RPI increase for existing pensions ought to be accompanied by appropriate action t oremove tax Incentives to provide this sort of pre-award inflation-proofingand the post-award inflation-proofing corresponding to increases paid under the Pensions (Increase) Act, if rank discrimination against thepublic services is to be avoided.ARGUMENTS AGAINST MODIFYING THE 1976 PENSIONS INCREASE7.        Pensions are essentially different from pay, and even after lastyear&apos;s increase Civil Service pensions now average only  17. 50 a week.The arguments for not interfering wife toe status quo include:-i.      the principle of protecting the living standards of occupational pensioners was seen in 1971 as a not particularlygenerous advance towards social justice.    More than a millionpensioners will have made their plans on Hie assurance thattheir pensions would be fully protected against inflation, andsome will have bought added years on mat assumption;U.      existing pension arrangements have not been restrictedunder any previous incomes policy.   Any connection betweenprotection for occupational pensions and the pay limits would best be avoided in the broader context of national pensionspolicy;iii.      any departure from the principle of price-indexing - otherperhaps than as a short-term interruption of the existing arrangements - would be at variance win the inflation-proofingconcept built into the Governments new pension scheme,whereby the State scheme will from 1978 provide price-indexing on that part of an Occupational pension which issubstituted for State pension under the contracting-outarrangements,3
iv.       Inflation is now being successfully brought under control,and this year&apos;s likely Increase of 13 *- 14 per cent for publicservice pensioners would be only about half last year&apos;s increase and should be the last one of a higher-th&amp;n-normal magnitude.In these circumstances, it would be better not to Incur theopposition of the trade unions and grapple with the difficultiesof legislation involved In modifying the existing arrangements.THE ATTITUDE OF THE TRADE UNIONS8.        The TUC have taken the view, in response to a specific enquiryfrom the National Union of Mineworkers, that mere is nothing under thenew pay policy to preclude increases in pensions in payment underestablished arrangements.   In practice, of course, any modification ofpensions increase would be unlikely to affect die National Union of mine worker a&apos; membership.    The TUC know, however, that Whitehall islooking at the problem of the better-off pensioners.9.        The National Staff Side have expressed to me their strong opposition to any interference, given mat the Government had elected forthe cheaper option of linking pensions to prices rather than pay.   Theyargued that, whereas employees who accepted pay restraint in any oneyear could in future hope to make up the deficit, the pensioner would never catch up.   Nor could there bs any guarantee that modificationwould only be for one year once the Government tampered with the 1971Act,   Above all, they were opposed to discrimination against the public sector.LEGISLATION AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME10.      The Treasury Solicitor has advised that any of the modificationsenvisaged in this paper could not be implemented under the existinglimited provisions in the pensions (Increase) Act 1971 for modifyingpublic service pensions; a temporary amendment of the 1971 Act would therefore be necessary.   As the details in the Annex show, however, thiswould not restrict increases throughout the wider public sector, e. g. british steel and British Airways.   Primary legislation would in any event be needed for the private sector.   Something on the lines of Section 1 of the remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975 is theoretically a possibility;but, bearing In mind the complex permutation of many schemes, consults-tlon with the Interested parties would be needed before comprehensiveinstructions could be issued to the draftsmen.11.      Now that the Government have lost several days of parliamentary time and cannot count on the co-operation of the Opposition in either House,the Lord President very much doubts whether the idea of getting a Bill on pensions on to the Statute Book by the Recess is any longer feasible.   Itwould probably suffice to obtain Royal Assent by the end of the Session, but even so the Lord President considers that the addition of any Bill wouldexacerbate the already severe problems of completing those Bills alreadyIntroduced - unless the Government were to make room by dropping one ormore of the fairly substantial Bills which have not yet made muchParliamentary progress.4
COMPARISON WITH BASIC STATE PENSION12.       The basic State pension is due to go up by about 15 per cent nextNovember to  15.30.    The increase in public service pensions of some13-14 per cent is unlikely, therefore, to cause any embarrassmentqua the basic State pension.CONCLUSION13.      There is a strong case, in principle, for some modification of thepresent arrangements.   There are, however, considerable practicaldifficulties in that course of action.   Moreover, If modification, were notto do more harm man good, great care would be needed in deciding whatthe change should be and how it should be presented and enforced.14.      The main considerations are:-1.       The best justification for restricting price-indexationin present circumstances is that the better-off among occupational pensioners should take some reasonable share in the decline ofliving standards.    Against the background of an unprecedentedbut now declining rate of inflation, any modification should be presented as a quite exceptional interruption of the existinginflation-proofing arrangements.li.      Discriminatory treatment against the public services must be avoided.    In practice, this condition would probably be met if any limitation on pensions increase were seen to apply effectively toall the public services, the nationalised industries, the majorprivate sector companies which give discretionary cost of livingadjustments and were also accompanied by the withdrawal by the inland Revenue of tax concessions to non-Government employers to provide pre- and poet-award inflation-proofing.    The questionof pensions increase was dealt with by the Government outsidethe TUC pay guidelines last year, and any action on a selectivebasis this year could be covered in the accompanying government statement.   If no satisfactory way could be found of avoidingsingling-out the public services, however, that would be a very strong argument for leaving things as they are.iii.      The simplest formula would be to deny all increases above a given level of pension income from all sources.    The leastarbitrary alternative would be to treat the 1976 pensions increase by broad analogy with either me Round 1 or the Round 2 pay limits.Modification would mitigate, although it would not solve, the&quot;overtaking&quot; problem.5
iv. A 13 or 14 per cent pensions Increase would cost about 120 million for the public services in a full year; modificationwould save only a small part of this cost.   A   8, 500 cut-off wouldmean for the Civil Service no increase at all for some75 pens loner a and would save about  90, 000.   A cut-off of  6 a week (ie    primarily by reference to the pay limit for theperiod covered by the inflation-proofing arrangements for thepublic services) would probably affect up to 5 per cent of theone million public service pensioners; a cut-off of  4 a week(by reference to the next stage of the pay policy) would probablyaffect some 15 - 20 per cent.   In both cases the overallpercentage saving In cost would be far less since all these   &apos;pensioners would receive some increase.v. If pension increases were withheld, or restricted, above a given level, the following table shows the relationship betweenannual amounts of pension and the cost of living increases in prospect;.Amount of Pension 13% Increase         14% Increase  *                          910 (average) 118                        1271485 -                         225 (*4pw)1600 208 ( 4 pw)2230 -                         312 ( 6pw)2400 312 ( 6 pw)4000 520                        5606000 780                        8408500 1105 119010000 1300 1400vi.       The TUC and the pensions industry would need to be consulted before any decision were announced to restrict pension increases.vfi.      If the Government decide against modifying pensions increase this year, the defence would have to rely primarily upon the argument that the rate of inflation had been halved and it wouldnot now be right to interfere with pensions.RECOMMENUA TlON15.       The main options open for the policy to govern pension increases under the next round of the counter-inflation programme are:-i.      to restrict Increases by applying either the  6 or  4 limit;a.      to restrict increases by an arbitrary cut-off at  8, 500 or some lower figure;6
iii.       not to restrict existing arrangements for protectingpensions in payment.The arguments for and against some restraint are finely balanced.   Eitherway, the Government will have to face criticism, though from differentquarters.   On balance, however, the practical difficulties in the way of restricting increases seem overriding.   Now that inflation is being brought under control, I recommend that we proceed as under iii. although we mayhave to be ready to face a campaign in Parliament and the media mat the tax- payer is again being unfairly asked to protect the public sectorpensioner, which is, of course, not true.civil Service Department14 June 19767
