Main ReportSECRET1976 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY GENERAL REVIEWIntroductionIn March the Cabinet asked that officials should prepare a SurveyReport showing base line figures and setting out proposals for additional expenditure and feasible illustrative options showing howreductions of at least 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent in the later years could be achieved in each departments programmes. the detailed ground rules for the Survey, as approved by the Cabinet, are reproduced at Annex A.Developments since publication of Cmnd. 63932. Cmnd. 6393 was the outcome of a wide ranging review. For1975-76 and 1976-77 it showed greater expenditure than previouslyplanned mainly reflecting the priority given to industrial expenditure and the need to take account of the recession. The White Papershowed, consistent with the terms of the Letter of Application tothe IMF, that at least during the next three years or so no overallgrowth in public expenditure (excluding debt interest) was plannedbeyond the level then envisaged for 1976-77.3. The latest, but still very preliminary, estimates of outturn in1975-76 suggest that most programmes were running below the totalspublished in the White Paper. The main exception was the housing programme, where there was substantial overspending on severalelements, affecting Scotland, Wales and England. The net total forprogrammes seems to have fallen short of the White Paper total bya little more than the published general provision for shortfall.4. The figures for 1976-77 incorporate some downward estimatingchanges but they are less than the apparent savings in 1975-76.At the same time the Government have agreed additions to someprogrammes in 1976-77. These have been aimed at taking the edgeoff unemployment and the need to finance steel stocks during the recession. There have also been improvements in social security benefits which carry through to years after 1976-77 and significantlyreduce the amount of savings decided upon last December. these and other changes are summarised in Part 2.Outcome of Survey5. The detailed programme tables at the beginning of each pro-gramme chapter in Part 2 and summarised in Table A on page 8reflect the Cmnd. 6393 totals adjusted for:(i) decisions taken by Cabinet up to 31 May on use of the contingency reserve including the cost of the child benefitdecision announced on 25 May;
(ii) any reduction in the estimated cost of individual services;(iii) revised estimates of the unattributed e.c. contributionsincluded in programme 2.The base line figures in the programme tables do not reflect thedecision announced in Cmnd. 6393 to make blanket reductions of 50 million in 1977-78,  140 million in 1978-79 and  130 million in1979-80 (at 1975 Survey prices) in civil service staff costs. TheCivil Service Department have been conducting an exercise aimed at settling the allocation of these cuts and their proposals are likelyto be considered by the Cabinet in July.6. Potential additions to the base-line expenditure programmes are summarised at Annex B and described in Part 2. These additionsare broken down into 3 categories:(a) demand determined and other requirements for the mainten-ance of existing policies;(b) proposals for new developments;(c) proposals for new developments which are contingent on aparticular event.7. As instructed by Cabinet, officials have examined the scope for savings to offset additional bids and have also costed further optionsfor reductions, amounting to at least 2\ per cent of programmes in1977-78 and 5 per cent in later years. Details of these are sum-marised in Annex C and described in Part 2 of this Report.8. The summaries at Annexes B and C exclude details of bids for additional expenditure on civil service staff related items and thescope for further reductions where a departments expenditure ispredominantly on manpower. These are summarised in Annex D.Given the difficulties being met in the Lord Privy Seal*s exercise to save  140 million on this expenditure, it will clearly be difficult to achieve compensating savings within this area. This implies thatsome increase in the size of the civil service will be an inevitableconsequence of accepting these bids. Additions for nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure and savings options are described in a separate report (see paragraph 12 below).secret

In the Survey it is necessary to take account of the fact that itbrings together expenditure of very different kinds; different in termsof economic category and also the degree of control it is possible forCentral Government to exercise over the expenditure. Someexpenditure represents direct use of resources by the public sector in purchasing goods and services; other expenditure covers transfersto the private sector or the acquisition of existing assets. The demandwhich different kinds of expenditure place on resources varies thoughany addition to public expenditure has implications for monetary policy and international confidence. Survey figures are broken downby economic category in Table B.11. The degree of Government control over expenditure pro-grammes varies widely. Its control over its own expenditure is limited in certain cases because some benefits and services are provided on demand to any qualified recipient, e.g. social security benefits and family practitioner services. In such cases there is littleaction that can be taken in the short term to contain expenditure within a given control total, although in the longer term the levelof spending can be affected by legislative or other action. Theexpenditure of other spending authorities is controlled only to alimited extent, and it has therefore been necessary to build uparrangements for monitoring and consultation. The special problemsof local authority expenditure are described in Annex E.
12. As was the case last year, the nationalised industries&apos; capitalexpenditure programmes are the subject of a separate review by ministers which includes consideration of options. This review was presented in June as El (76) 32. The programmes reflect the vieweach industry has of its contribution to the economy over the next decade and more, and the commercial policies it must pursue if it isto make that contribution. Following discussions by the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy decisions on theprogramme approvals to be given to the industries will be taken by cabinet as part of the decisions on the Survey. The object is to take these decisions before the Recess, to the benefit of the nationalised industries and their suppliers. As the upturn in the economydevelops, it is particularly important that the suppliers should notbe left in uncertainty about the orders they will be getting from the nationalised industries.Cash limits13. In 1976-77 cash limits have been applied in one form or anotherto about 62 per cent of public expenditure programmes. this initiative will be carried forward into subsequent years subject to any modifications and developments which may prove desirable in thelight of experience. The cash limits for 1977-78 will reflect the deci-sions taken by Ministers in this Survey but, as this year, the cashlimits once fixed will take primacy over the volume figures.Contingency reserve and shortfall14. In past years Governments have added more to public expendi-ture by policy decisions than was provided in the contingency reserveincorporated in White Papers. In addition expenditure on some services has tended to exceed estimates for reasons beyond theimmediate control of Government. These factors have contributedtowards upward &quot;creep&quot; in figures contained in successive white papers.15. The Cabinet agreed on 5 February 1976 that special arrange-ments should be made to ensure that the contingency reserveincluded in Cmnd. 6393 was not over-committed. Treasury ministers have since reported to Cabinet regularly on the state of the con-contingency reserve (particularly in 1976-77) after taking account ofagreed and recommended claims and known potential bids. This has proved an invaluable aid to restraining expenditure. Nevertheless,but for the estimating reductions which have been incorporated in the base line figures in accordance with the ground rules, the contingency reserve balance shown in the table above would have been sub-stantially reduced only a few months after publication of Cmnd. 6393.Moreover although account is taken of estimating reductions in thisSECRET 5
Main ReportSECRETway it should be noted that there was also provision by way of ageneral deduction for shortfall in Cmnd. 6393. In this Survey itis necessary to take a fresh look at the appropriate level of contin-gency reserve and shortfall/longfall provisions.16. In reaching a view on the level of provision for the contingency reserve it is necessary to strike a balance between one which is so small that it is rapidly exceeded because of additions which are regarded as reasonable by Ministers and one which is so large thatit undermines the discipline of maintaining programme totals. the contingency reserve must therefore be large enough to accommodateinescapable additions to programmes before they are reviewed inthe next Survey without affording an incentive for major decisions to be postponed until after the Survey.17. The amounts to be included in the next White Paper as a con-contingency reserve are a matter for decision. For the purpose of thisreport, a reserve has been included in the tables of the followingamounts which (apart from 1976-77) are the same as those in the equivalent year in Cmnd. 6393, suitably rounded.  million at 1976 Survey prices	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Contingency reserve in this					Report       ....	400	800	1,100	1,400	1,700Cmnd. 6393 contingency reserve	825	1,050	1,425	1,650	-18. The extent to which programmes need to be reduced toreconstitute the reserve without exceeding the totals in Cmnd. 6393will of course depend on the amount of additional bids in Annex Bwhich are conceded without offsetting savings. Even on the assump-tion that no such additions to the programmes were allowed the comparison with Cmnd. 6393 would be:  million at 1976 Survey prices	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Cmnd. 6393 programmes(&apos;) Cmnd. 6393 contingency reserve .	54,304 825	53,389 1,050	52,927 1,425	53,327 1,650	Total .	55,129	54,439	54,352	54,977	-Survey programmes^) Survey contingency reserve .	54,477 400	53,700 800	53,175 1,100	53,564 1,400	53,533 1,700Total . &apos;    .	54,877	54,500	54,275	54,964	55,233Difference from Cmnd. 6393	-252	+6I	-77	-13	--(&apos;) Before taking account of the civil service manpower savings rising to  140 million at 1975 Survey prices in 1978-79.
Conclusion19. Because of careful husbanding of the contingency reserve andsome estimating reductions which are in the base-line figures it wouldbe possible, if no additional bids without offsetting savings wereconceded in the Survey, to include in the Survey a contingency reserve of about the same size as in Cmnd. 6393. Any net additions to programmes which are made can only mean a smaller contin-gency reserve or higher total expenditure. The main decisions whichare required in this Survey are therefore:(a) how much of the extra requirement for the major &quot; demand-determined &quot; services should be accepted and what policy decisions should be made to limit any addition?(b) how much should be accepted of the other additional pro-posals without offsetting savings?(c) the size of the contingency reserve;(d) which of the options for reducing expenditure should beadopted?SECRET7

ANNEX ADraft ground rules for preparation of 1976 Survey report . The purpose of the Survey is to enable Ministers to review thepublic expenditure programmes in the light of the latest view of theeconomic prospects, and any other new developments includingchanges in basic data, without any general increase in the total amount allocated in each Survey year to programmes and the contingency reserve.The base-line2. For the years up to 1979-80 the &quot; base &quot; should be the pro-gramme figures which underlay the February 1976 White Paper(Cmnd. 6393), adjusted for :(a) policy decisions taken by Ministers before the starting date for the Survey, i.e. 6 April;(b) any estimating changes which have been accepted by ministers as a charge on the contingency reserve beforethe starting date;(c) any offsetting savings that may have been imposed as acondition of (a) or (6);(*/) any approved classification changes;(e) revaluation to 1976 Survey prices.3. For 1980-81 the &quot;base&quot; figures should be the same as those for 1979-80 calculated as in paragraph 2 above, except to the extent that adjustments may be necessary for a particular service (eitherup or down) because of specific demographic reasons accepted forthe purpose of calculating the 1979-80 figures in the 1975 SurveyReport.The Survey4. Subject to paragraph 7 below, the figures for each year in the survey tables for each service should not be greater than the &quot; base &quot;figures as defined in paragraphs 2 and 3. If existing policy cannow be carried out with less, the lesser figures should however besubstituted.5. Proposals for additional expenditure, either for the maintenanceof existing policies or for new developments, should be separatelycosted for each Survey year. The Survey Report should contain a brief description of any such proposals and the reasons for them,
distinguishing between (a) additional requirements for services whichare demand-determined and governed by statute or binding con-contractual commitments; (b) other requirements for the maintenanceof existing policies; and (c) proposals for new developments. Itshould also explain how expenditure could be held within the Surveyfigures either by policy modifications or by other suggestions foroffsetting savings within the departments programmes.Options6. In addition to any savings identified under the previous para-graph, the Report should also display feasible illustrative optionsshowing how reductions of at least 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and5 per cent in the later years could be achieved in each departmentsprogrammes. These should be costed for each Survey year, witha brief commentary on the practical and, where relevant, legislativeimplications of each item. Where programmes have separate scottish and Welsh components, options should be included for thesealso. (Nationalised industries&apos; capital investment will be handledseparately in the report mentioned in paragraph 7 (a) below.)Other points7.   The following categories should be treated as indicated below:(a) The investment programmes of the nationalised industries in Programme 5 (and the Civil Aviation Authority) willbe the subject of a separate report to Ministers. Ifdecisions have been taken on that report before the survey Report has been completed, the Survey report should give a brief summary of the effect of those decisions on the Survey figures.(b) Cmnd. 6393 mentioned certain approved expenditure pro-posals which had not at that stage been fully costed,and therefore represented a claim on the contingency reserve. Wherever possible, these should now berealistically costed and the figures set out separately inthe Survey report so that decisions can be taken on them.(c) For debt interest and unattributed e.c. contributions, thelatest forecast should be given.8. The Survey Report should reflect the decisions taken to imple-ment the savings in civil service manpower announced in Cmnd.6393, and any consequential savings in programmed expenditure.The options in paragraph 6 should be additional to any such savings.SECRET 11

The Government can influence the level of local authoritycurrent spending but has no formal powers of control either over its total or over its allocation between services. Through its controlof local authority borrowing the Government does have effective control over programmes of capital expenditure, but as a deliberatepolicy it does not exercise its power to restrict new housebuilding,which accounts for the bulk of housing capital expenditure.Recent developments3. During the past 12 months, the Consultative Council on LocalGovernment Finance has met frequently and developed as a usefulforum for consultation and improved understanding between central and local government. In particular, the local government membersof the Council have expressed a strong wish to be involved asdirectly as possible in the annual public expenditure reviews, sothat their views on local authority services and expenditure can betaken fully into account when Ministers take decisions. For the1976 Survey therefore the local government members have been assured that they will be consulted during the review; and prepara-tory work is being undertaken at official level between departments and the local authority associations.4. The quarterly collection of figures of local authority staff numbers, which was begun last year, and the publicity involved inthe announcement of these figures, continue to draw attention toCurrentCapital:Housing .Other    .
the need for economy in staffing. Particular interest in the implications-tions of developing policies for the numbers of staff employed hasbeen shown by the trade unions and by the TUC Local Govern-ment Committee on their behalf. A continuing series of meetings between Ministers and the Committee on this aspect of localgovernment affairs can be expected to be held so long as the pressureis maintained for restraint in the labour intensive services which local authorities provide.5. Thus it was not until the matter had been discussed in the consultative Council, and informally with the trade union leadersmainly concerned, that the Government announced its reaction tothe figures of local authority current expenditure shown in the recentDOE/CIPFA returns. These suggested that local authorities inEngland and Wales had exceeded the provision in Cmnd. 6393 bysome  150 million in 1975-76 and were planning to overspendby some  350-450 million in 1976-77. The returns may well haveexaggerated the prospective overspending; but local authorities havebeen told, with the endorsement of the Council, that the excess isin any case unacceptable to the Government. They have been askedto revise their expenditure plans so as to eliminate the excessaltogether, and to submit revised returns by mid-July.6. Parallel action is being taken in Scotland where the prospectiveoverspending in 1976-77 amounts to some  40 million. The re-organisation of local government with effect from the beginning of1975-76 appears to have been followed by a substantial increase in expenditure by the new district councils on miscellaneous environ-mental services. The need to accommodate this increase is addingconsiderably to the Governments task in seeking to contain totalexpenditure within restricted totals.7. Meanwhile, the Lay field Committee on Local government finance has reported and its recommendations are being examined.The Committee have suggested that Ministers might have a muchmore limited role in determining policies in local services in future.On the control of local authority expenditure, however, the Com-mittee accepted without qualification that the Government need,for macro-economic reasons, to be able to control total spending,whatever the respective roles of central and local government in determining policies in individual services. In considering theReport therefore officials are examining possible ways inwhich the Government might secure more effective control overexpenditure.
Estimates of current expenditure. The recent DOE/CIPFA returns suggested overspending inEngland and Wales in 1975-76 (compared with Cmnd. 6393) of some 150 million made up in very round terms of:9. These figures suggest that any overspending may have beenspread fairly widely between services. It is doubtful whether anyfurther significance should be attached to the precise figures for individual services. More reliability can be attached to the estimateof total overspending but this also is of course liable to be furtherrevised when fuller annual returns are received in the autumn.10. The Scottish figures for 1975-76 (and indeed 1974-75) under-state the probable outturn because of the problem of collecting dataduring the period of local government re-organisation, the maindeficiencies occurring in Other environmental services. Theaddition of  55 million which has to be made is therefore a moretentative estimate than for England and Wales. It assumes thatScottish authorities have spent around  10 million more in 1975-76than was expected at the time of the rate support grant negotiationsfor 1976-77.11. For 1976-77, it is reasonable to expect that authorities willrespond with some substantive action towards eliminating the pros-pective overspending. But complete elimination would require a lower level of expenditure (and hence fewer staff) than in 1975-76.The Chief Secretary has pointed out in his reports to Cabinet onclaims on the contingency reserve that there might be overspendingof the order of  100 million. It is the general view of the Depart-ments concerned that it would be imprudent to assume that over-spending in England and Wales will, in the event, be less than this:it could well be  200 million. Similarly, in Scotland it would be prudent to assume overspending of the order of  20 million.12. The Government has already announced publicly that localauthorities&apos; total current expenditure in England and Wales in1977-78 must be confined within the figures shown in Cmnd. 6393(and paragraph 1 above). These figures will not be increased in the  million at 1976 Survey pricesEducationPersonal social servicesHome Office servicesLocal transportEnvironmental servicesHousingEmployment7510252020150
SECRETrate support grant negotiations this autumn: indeed, in determining the amount of grant in 1977-78, the Government will assume thattheir expenditure in 1976-77 has been kept down to the approvedlevel and that any money which they could have used to financeadditional expenditure will be available for use in 1977-78. Localauthorities will thus be under strong pressure from the Governmentand from their own ratepayers to keep down their spending. TheCabinet have agreed that comparable action in all respects shouldbe taken in Scotland.13. On the other hand, in view of the difficulties which some localauthorities will face, particularly in reducing staff numbers, theDepartments concerned have no great confidence that, in the absenceof further measures, they will retrench sufficiently in 1977-78 to recover any ground lost in 1976-77. Perhaps the best that can reasonably be hoped for is that there would be no increase onwhatever level is reached in 1976-77. If an actual reduction is tobe achieved between 1976-77 and 1977-78, the alternative courseswould be:(a) To impose an even tougher rate support grant settlement.But it is possible that it would take a really large reduc-tion in grant, and therefore a large increase in local rates,to force authorities to cut back.(b) To give specific, and more restrictive, guidance to authorities on the policies to be followed in individual services.(The options are outlined in the programme chaptersin Part 2 of this Report.) But the local government sideof the Consultative Council have repeatedly warned that,to be effective, such guidance must be given before the summer Recess.Either course would of course have to face the opposition of thetrade unions and the TUC Local Government Committee in defenceof their interests; and the resentment at large rate increases causedby reduced grant would not necessarily be directed solely at localauthorities.14. It is not possible to comment in detail on the prospects for1978-79 and later years. Developments over the next 12 months willdemonstrate what can (or cannot) be achieved with the means of influence at present at the Governments disposal. Restriction ofthe amount of rate support grant is clearly a limited weapon. Oneimplication of what has already been announced for 1977-78 is areduction of several per cent in the present rate of grant; and action under (a) above would mean an even larger reduction.  Continuing
Main Report: Annex Eaction of this sort, relying on the unpopularity of large rate increases to contain expenditure, could prove impracticable. Substantial off-setting savings in local authority capital expenditure would haveto be considered as an alternative, although the limitations on suchaction are illustrated by the figures in paragraph 1 above. In anycase, whatever can be achieved in the short to medium term in conditions of general stringency, there are clearly strong grounds for improving the present arrangements for central control and influence over total local authority spending, and this is being pursued in the context of the Layfield Committee&apos;s Report.
ANNEX FPublic expenditure in cost terms in the three years between 1972-73 and 1975-76 public expenditureincreased from 50 per cent of GDP at factor cost to about 59 per cent.Much of this increase was due to the fact that public expenditureincreased by 17 per cent in volume over this period while theincrease in output was not more than 2 per cent. But a significantproportion, about one-third, reflected the fact that prices in public expenditure increased by 6 per cent more than domestic prices ingeneral represented by the GDP deflator^2. If current prices can be taken to represent the relative costs ofdifferent items of expenditure, it is clear that the volume measurementof public expenditure, at unchanging prices, did not representadequately over this period the increase in the real cost of expendi-ture. A separate series of figures is therefore prepared &quot; at constant prices in cost terms, including the relative price effect These take account of price movements relative to the GDP deflator and thusbear the same relation to GDP at constant prices as does public expenditure at current prices to GDP at current prices. Table Con page 32 shows public expenditure in these terms in programmedetail. The total &quot; relative price effect &quot; is shown on a cumulative andyear-to-year basis at the foot of the table in   million at 1975-76prices, together with the year-to-year relative price changes whichcause it.3. The outstanding feature of the last five years is the sharp increasein the relative price of public expenditure in 1973-74 and 1974-75and the fall back in 1975-76. The rise was due to a number of specialfactors, including the increase in import prices, especially oil, which also, of course, affected prices paid by the private sector, though not(directly) the GDP deflator which reflects home costs only; theincrease in land prices and construction costs; and some large publicservice pay increases as the statutory wage restraints were relaxed.4. Chart A on page 33 shows the main components of the rela-tive price increase of public expenditure, in terms of economiccategories capital and current expenditure, pay, procurement andso on. A major element in the increase was the explosion in landprices and construction costs from 1972.  Land prices were affected* It does not follow that the public sector paid more than the private sector for similar goods and services. In general the public sector buys a larger proportionof the things that tend to increase most in price. Also, during this period almost all unsubsidised prices rose faster than the GDP deflator, which is not directly affected by import prices.
immediately, with relative increase in 1972-73 of over 30 per cent over 1971-72. Construction contract prices also began to risesharply, but actual expenditure in 1972-73 was little affected. Ascontracts got under way expenditure more and more reflected thecost increase, first in dwellings and a little later in other construc-tion work. In 1973-74 procurement costs began to be affected bythe world increase in commodity costs and in 1974-75 they were affected by this general increase and even more by the increase inoil prices. Pay increases in the public services, following the relaxation-tion of the statutory incomes policy, also contributed substantially to the increase in relative costs in 1974-75.5. This was also however the first year to show the effect of the collapse of the construction and land prices bubble, with a sharpfall in the average price paid for land. The fall in tender costs was apparent in a relative fall in prices paid for public sector housingwork in 1975-76, and a check to the relative increase in otherconstruction costs. Thus the price movement of the various elements in public expenditure between 1974-75 and 1975-76 was very uneven.This unevenness is also reflected in the change between 1975 and1976 Survey prices, and hence contributes to the difference betweenthe programme pattern of expenditure as shown at 1975 survey prices in Cmnd. 6393 and as revalued to 1976 Survey prices in thisReport.6. Chart B shows an analysis of the overall relative price movementof public expenditure between the main programmes. The diver-gence between programmes is smaller than the divergence betweeneconomic categories, simply because most programmes are made up of a mix of economic categories. But the influence of constxuc-tion costs on housing and to a lesser extent on other environmental services, and of the 1974 pay increases on education and health, isclear.7. The charts also show the basis of the provision for the relative price effect in the years to 1980-81. The projection of relative pricemovements is extremely hazardous. At this stage there seems noreason to expect exceptional price movements like those of recentyears. Only limited and formalised allowances have been made forrelative price changes. The general trend of wage and salary costsis upwards relative to the GDP deflator, because of the way in whichthey are conventionally measured. The projections take accountof this trend, and also of the TUC policy on pay settlements. Arelative fall in construction costs over the next few years is forecast,based partly on information on the prices in contracts already signed,
and partly on the assumption that they will move back towards the relation to other prices which they have borne in the past.Procurement prices have been estimated directly for 1976-77 and thereafter are assumed to show the same sort of trend relative to theGDP deflator as in the past. The net effect is a small relative price increase from 1976-77, of less than \ per cent a year on average.TABLE CPublic expenditure by programme in cost terms: 1971-72 to 1980-81  million	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81As 1975-76 prices including										the relative price effect										I.

The baseline figures assume that defencespending would continue at the level agreed for theyears up to 1979-80 following the Defence review and the further reductions in the support structureannounced in Cmnd. 6393.2. The figures for the years up to 1979-80 embodythe savings which the Defence Secretary has under-taken to make and are agreed. The Ministry ofDefence do not accept the figure for 1980-81,which they consider should be higher by up to some 190 million.Additional bid3. The Defence Review figure for 1980-81 is 5,871 million, or  235 million above the baseline inthe table above. The Ministry of Defence point outthat our Allies are aware that expenditure at this level is planned, and that they know the level ofcapability which it represents. Consequently their view is that any significant reduction in 1980-81which cannot be represented as consistent with thelevel of capability which we have justified to our allies following the Defence Review and the reductions announced in Cmnd, 6393 will be seen byNATO as yet another cut in the resources which theGovernment is prepared to devote to defence.  Aswith the policy options discussed below, a decision toreduce the 1980-81 Defence Budget to the figurealready approved for 1979-80 (i.e. to the baselinelevel), on top of the Defence Review and theCmnd. 6393 reductions which have already causedour Allies serious misgivings, would have the mostserious and far-reaching implications for the alliance.4. Assuming that receipts from the federal republic as offset to the costs of United kingdom forces in Germany were to continue at the rateassumed for 1977-78 to 1979-80 ( 50 million a year)the figure of  5,871 million for 1980-81 could, takingalso into account increased receipts from HongKong, be reduced to  5,811 million, or  175 millionabove the Survey baseline of  5,636 million. If theGovernment were ready to accept the political consequences of a withdrawal from Cyprus by1979-80, the figure would be brought down by afurther  36 million to  5,775 million or  139 millionabove the Survey baseline.5. On the other hand, in addition to the cost ofthe present defence programme allowance has also tobe made in 1980-81 for the costs of dispersal toCardiff and Glasgow. The Ministry of Defenceconsider that the Defence Budget figure will haveto be increased to take account of these costs, whichcould add a further  15 million in 1980-81 and will need to be separately identified in subsequent years.SECRET
6. Taking all these factors into account, theMinistry of Defence additional bid aboTe the base-line figure is for either  154 million or  190 million for 1980-81 depending on the decision about with-drawal from Cyprus.7. The Treasury consider that it should be possibleto meet our present NATO commitments in 1980-81without increasing defence expenditure above thebroadly stable level of preceding years. They believethat, taking account of the continuing savings whichshould arise from the reductions of nearly  200 mil-lion a year made since the Defence Review in theyears 1976-77 to 1979-80, together with such othermiscellaneous measures as may be necessary, theDefence Budget figure for 1980-81 could be held atthe baseline level of  5,636 million without signifi-cant adverse effect on the Alliance.8. The Treasury do not accept the Ministry ofDefence view that the cost of dispersal should be additional to the Cmnd. 6393 figures for the defence budget. Dispersal has been firm Government policy since 1974 and its net cost should be met without anadditional claim.Policy options9. Application of the percentage reductions laiddown in the Survey ground rules to the defencefigures in Table I above gives the following savings,the implications of which are explained below:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81141	282	282	282The baseline figure for 1980-8! is already below the previously planned (i.e. Defence Review) defence budget for that year. The total reduction implied bythe options is therefore nearly  1,200 million for thefour years in question. Such reductions would be additional to the Defence Review savings already made for these years and to the further cuts reflected in Cmnd. 6393.10, The Ministry of. Defence, point out that thareductions achieved in the Defence Review and thefurther cuts reflected in Cmnd. 6393 already totalsome  2,900 million for the three years 1977-78 to1979-80, or about 15 per cent of the pre-defence review planned expenditure.  Cuts of this size arestill being explained to NATO only with greatdifficulty. On the basis that the Defence Reviewidentified the critical level of military capabilitynecessary to support our essential NATO commit-ments and that the Cmnd. 6393 cuts, found largely from the support area, were an extension of theDefence Review and compatible with that criticallevel, we have been able to present the cuts as acoherent whole and in the least damaging lightpossible. Nevertheless tml Allies, and particoiaiVythe Americans and the Germans, expressed seriousmisgivings on both occasions. The Alliance has notyet completed its consideration of the Cmnd. 6393reductions.11 - But the Defence Review has now been exhaustedas a source of savings. Finding  1,200 million asin paragraph 9 above would leave no choice but to seek the major part of the saving from the frontlineforces which we contribute to NATO in one or bothof the Central European and Eastern Atlantic areas.A reduction of that order in our commitments would clearly be wholly inconsistent with the critical levelof capability. It would entail a fundamental changein the Governments current foreign and defence policy; and, because of the reappraisal of our commitments and the restructuring of the forces that would be required, a further Defence Review,comparable in thoroughness to that carried out in1974, would have to be undertaken.12. Such an exercise could hardly be kept secret;indeed there would be strong arguments for keepingNATO fully informed in ofder to limit the ensuingdamage. But undertaking an exercise that evenappeared to imply a third round of major reductionsafter the Defence Review and the 1975 public expenditure exercise would have an incalculableimpact on our political credibility generally; and onthe view of our seriousness as an ally which wouldbe taken by NATO in general, and by the UnitedStates of America and the Federal Republic ofGermany in particular. The cohesion of the Allianceitself could be put at risk and the morale of the armed Forces would be seriously affected.13. The domestic political and industrial implications-tie-as would be considered  -abte. There -wovrirl be %further loss of employment. This would be over and above the cuts of 78,000 servicemen and civilians,and the 60,000 direct and 80,000 indirect jobopportunities lost in industry, as a result of theDefence Review and the 1975 Survey.  And the
losses of industrial employment would fall heavily onthe newly nationalised shipbuilding and aerospaceindustries. Apart from these more general considera-tions, action on these lines would make it much less likely that the Germans would be prepared to enterinto a new offset agreement from which, underthe 1975 public expenditure review, receipts of 50 million a year have been assumed. Thus in theMinistry of Defence view there are no feasibleoptions for further savings in the Defence budget of 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent thereafter.14. The Treasury point out that the agreedobjective on German offset is to secure  100 million a year up to 1980-81. Receipts in excess of the 50 million level assumed in the Survey calculationswould enable part of the illustrative savings to bemet. They consider that it should, moreover, bepossible to achieve part of the policy option cuts bysome further squeeze on support costs (e.g. expendi-ture on quarters and non-military stores) and other minor measures which would not have a serious effect on our defence posture. They agree that ifthe Survey options were to be implemented in fullthis would involve some reduction in the capability of our front line forces. Nevertheless if the overallexpenditure situation were sufficiently difficult.Ministers would need to consider whether to acceptthe adverse operational consequences and the implications for the Alliance of further reductions inthe Defence Budget.National accounts adjustments15. The figures for the National accounts adjust-ments sub-programme incorporate a classificationchange affecting capital expenditure by the royal ordnance Factories. Expenditure on stocks financed by pre-payments from overseas customers is nowexcluded from the figures from 1976-77 onwards.secret

The Survey figures imply a growth in the aid programme in real terms by 16-5 per cent over theperiod 1976-77 to 1980-81. In 1974 the Govern-ment accepted in principle the United Nations&apos;target of 0-7 per cent of GNP for official develop-ment assistance. Although no undertakings havebeen given about the date of reaching this targetand it has been made clear that progress must besubject both to the pace of the United Kingdom&apos;economic recovery and to the other calls on our resources, the Government have said that in theyears ahead they will seek to move towards it. TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s performance rose from 0-35 percent in 1973 to 0-38 per cent in 1974 but remainedstatic in 1975. Although accurate forecasts are notpossible, the figures shown in Table 2 above arelikely to result in no more than a very slightimprovement in our performance. At the same timethe demands on the programme seem likely toincrease because of a number of factors among them pressures from developing countries in thewake of the fourth United Nations Conference on trade and Development (UNCTAD IV); the possi-bility of substantial debt relief; the growing demandsof the e.c. aid programme (now some 10 per cent of aid programme allocations); and the need tokeep an adequate contingency provision against asettlement in Rhodesia.Policy options2. The effect of reductions of 2\ per cent in1977-78 and 5 per cent in 1978-79 to 1980-81would be as follows:  million1977-78 1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Aid programme (Net)     13-6    &quot;&quot;28 - 9	30-0	300
Reductions of this order would not involve cuttingback on existing commitments. However, theMinistry of Overseas Development consider thatreductions would make it difficult to maintain anunallocated margin adequate for the type of con-contingencies referred to in paragraph 1 and at thesame time to press ahead with implementing the agreed aid strategy of concentrating aid on the poorest countries. Any reductions would thereforeentail reducing planning allocations to individual countries and international institutions, but thedistribution of any cuts would necessarily be deter-mined by the situation (including degree of commit-ment) existing at the time the decision to cut wasmade, and cannot be predicted in detail at this stage.3. At the same time the Ministry consider it mostimportant to have adequate room for manoeuvrein dealing with the outcome of the Conference on international Economic Co-operation and UNCTADIV, which may well result in sharply increasedinternational pressure on the donor countries tomove towards the 0-7 per cent target. The 1\ percent and 5 per cent reductions would mean that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s performance against the targetwould almost certainly decline, which would be contrary to Ministerial statements of intention andwould provide grounds for criticism domesticallyand internationally.Overseas aid administrationAdditional bid4. The Ministry of Overseas Development require an additional  0-5 million in 1980-81 to meetadditional expenditure for dispersal to EastKilbride.Review of overseas representation5. The four sub-programmes dealt with in para-graphs 6 to 22 below, either in whole or, in thecase of Other external relations, in part, are theresponsibility of the Foreign and commonwealth office (FCO). The policies underlying this expendi-ture are currently the subject of the Review of overseas Representation announced in the House ofCommons on 14 January 1976. In common withother Departments for which manpower costs forma major component of expenditure, the FCO is notpresenting illustrative cuts for certain manpower-SECRETintensive elements of their activities, viz. those staff-related sections of the Overseas representation and overseas information sub-programmes which fall tobe considered in the context of the Lord Privy SeaTsreview of civil service staff costs. With theseexceptions, illustrative cuts of 2\ per cent in1977-78 and 5 per cent in later years are shown on a strictly pro rata basis in each of the remainingsub-programmes or element thereof. The way inwhich any options for 1978-79 and later years mightactually be implemented and any reduction in man-power costs achieved will need to be considered inthe light of the Review of Overseas Representation.Overseas representationImplications of Survey figures6. This expenditure includes the cost of the FCOin London, representation abroad and official delega-tions to international organisations and conferences.It also includes the cost of Passport Offices, the communications organisation supporting the Diplo-matic Service and expenditure by the Property Ser-vices Agency (PSA) on the Diplomatic Estate.Expenditure on overseas representation declinesslightly over the period to 1979-80, mainly as aresult of more effective concentration of resources and cuts in staff and staff-related costs. In 1980-81however, provision is made for expenditure arisingfrom the United Kingdom&apos;s Presidency of the EECin 1981. Existing policies can be maintained though with some reduction in services during this period.Additional bid7.  0-5 million is sought in the year 1980-81 tomeet additional expenditure arising from the com-commitment to disperse 500 FCO jobs to Merseysideby 1981-82.Policy options8. On a pro rata basis, cuts in planned expenditureof 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent in thefollowing years on that part of this programme which does not fall to be considered in the context of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s review of civil service staffcosts would be:  million1977-78  1978-79 1979S0 1980-81Diplomatic estate .       0-9        1-7        1-7        1-77
9. Such cuts would lead to a slow-down in the10-year purchasing and building programme for the diplomatic Estate announced in 1971. Maintenanceof the existing estate would suffer.Overseas informationImplications of Survey figures10. This programme covers expenditure by theBritish Council (other than overseas aid); the BBCsExternal Services; FCO information staff at homeand abroad; and supporting services of the central office of Information (COI) and the Stationery Office.Expenditure on the programme as a whole willdecline slightly then level off over the period covered,reflecting the cuts included in Cmnd. 6393.Additional bid  million1976-77    1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-811-3         0-9	0-9	0-9	0-911. From 1976-77 onwards  0-9 million a year is sought to cover an extra contribution to the BBCexternal services pension fund and  0&apos;4 million in1976-77 to provide a loan for working capital forthe British Council&apos;s educational services to foreigncountries. (This was agreed in principle last year,but the money has not yet been drawn.)Policy options12. Cuts in planned expenditure of 2\ per centin 1977-78 and 5 per cent in the following years,applied on a pro rota basis to each element within this sub-programme other than Diplomatic service staff (see paragraph 5), would be as follows:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81FCO Operational expenditure	0-1	0-1	0-1	0-1BBC External Services	0-7	1-3	1-3	1-british Council (FCO share) .	0-4	0-9	0-9	0-9COI/HMSO	0-2	0-5	0-5	0-5Total	1-4	2-8	2-8	2-813. Cuts of this order could not be made by generalpruning but would involve the reduction or cessation-tion of activities in a number of fields, as follows:(a) In external broadcasting there would be areduction in the effective operation of bothBBC and FCO relay stations carrying the external services. The overdue renewal oftransmitting equipment essential to the effectiveness of those services would have tobe further postponed. In addition a numberof foreign language services would have to be terminated or reduced and it would not bepossible to expand such services to areas ofincreasing importance to British interests.(b) Similar reductions to the British Councilgrant-in-aid would necessitate withdrawal from some countries and major reductions in others,as well as general diminution in supplies andheadquarters services. Increased representa-tton in East Europe or elsewhere would be postponed indefinitely.(c) Comparable reductions would be requiredacross a wide range of activities undertaken by the Official Information Services including a reduction in the material produced by theCOI and the Stationery Office in support of theinformation activity of Diplomatic Service postsabroad. There would be significant reductions in the sponsored visits programme.Other external relationsImplications of Survey figures14. The main items of expenditure are the UnitedKingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to international organisations such as the United Nations andNATO; other payments to meet Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s other international commitments; pro-vision for the United Nations Force in Cyprus; andgrant-in-aid to the Commonwealth War graves commission. The gradual rise in planned expendi-ture over the period allows for increases in the levelof activity of some of the international organisations.Additional bids15.  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-813 9	3-9	3-9	3-9In 1977-78 and subsequent years  3-3 million is sought for a contribution to the support of theUnited Nations Emergency Force in the Middle east which is likely to continue-to operate in the fore-seeable future.   A further  0-6 million a year is
sought to maintain Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentssubscription to the Food and Agriculture Organisa-tion of the United Nations at the level which hasbeen agreed for 1976-77.Policy options16. Cuts of 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per centin each of the following years would amount to:  million1977-78  1978-79  1979-80  1980-81Commonwealth war graves Commission 0-1 0-2 0-2 0-other    ...     0-6        12        13        1-317. The Commonwealth War Graves commission has already undertaken to reduce its staff by 50 in1977-78, following earlier reorganisation which pro-duced reductions of 250. The savings listed abovecould only be achieved by further staff reductions of about 35 in 1977-78 and another 35 in 1978-79,which would drastically affect the Commission^power to carry out its duties.18. Since international obligations rule out uni-lateral reductions in United Kingdom subscriptionsto international organisations, the other savingslisted above would, in addition to cuts in many small items, require the following measures: ending the grant to the Commonwealth Institute; with-drawing from Council of Europe partial agreements in the social and health fields; restricting severelythe use for foreign visits of VIP facilities at airports;and cutting back or eliminating the repatriation ofdistressed British subjects.Military aidImplications of Survey figures19. This programme consists mainly of courses inthe United Kingdom for overseas service personnel and to a lesser extent the loan of British service per-sonnel to a few developing countries for training purposes. Programmed expenditure is level through-out the review period.Additional bid20. The following provision totalling  2-6 million over the Survey period is sought as the UnitedSECRETKingdom contribution to the cost of establishingand training a Belize Defence Force:  million1976-77    1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-810-3          10	0-5	0 3	0-5Policy options21. Cuts of 2$ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per centin the following years would amount to:  million1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-810-1 0*1 0-1 0*122. Cuts of this order would imply a one-thirdreduction in the loan of British service personnel to overseas Governments.Contribntion to the European Communities, etc.(net)23. This comprises United Kingdom contributions to the European Communities&apos; budget (excludingamounts attributed to aid and other programmes);capital contributions to the European InvestmentBank (following agreement, in July 1975, toincrease its capital); and receipts by the UnitedKingdom from the Communities&quot; budget. Conver-sions from units of account into sterling have beenmade at the present budget unit of account rate of2-4 units of account to the  .24. In accordance with the ground rules approvedby Ministers the latest forecasts of this expenditurehave been included. They have been built up by applying the forecast United Kingdom percentageshare of the Communities&apos; budget in each year toestimates of the cost of carrying out existing Com-munity policies. These estimates take account ofmodifications which are expected to occur in thosepolicies. The United Kingdom&apos;s share of the budget is fixed at 19-24 per cent in 1977 and will increaseprogressively in the following two years as theUnited Kingdom moves to the full own resourcessystem in 1980.25. The forecasts are substantially higher thanthose in Cmnd. 6393. This is due to a revised fore-cast of the United Kingdom&apos;s relative share of the9
budget in 1980 resulting from revised assessmentsof customs duties and agricultural levies, anincrease in the estimated cost of the common agricultural Policy, and a reduction in forecastUnited Kingdom receipts due to monetary com-pensatory amounts (MCAs) being paid to theexporter rather than the United Kingdom importer.These increases are partially offset by a reduction in expenditure of  71 million on Programme 3 as aresult of the changed arrangements for payingMCAs; in balance of payment terms the change willbe neutral.Additional bids26. The first Supplementary Budget of the Euro-pean Communities for 1976 will provide assistanceto Italy for reconstruction following the earthquakein May.

The Governments objectives and priorities for agriculture are set out in the White Paper &quot; food from our own Resources &quot; (Cmnd. 6020). A large part of expenditure on market regulation and agri-cultural support is determined in the context of theannual reviews of agriculture which are conductedboth nationally and on an e.c. basis. The fore-casts take account of the determinations at the 1976reviews. They reflect the completion in 1978 ofthe transitional period for aligning our agricultural prices (as expressed in e.c. units of account) withthe original members of the e.c.. They also allow for the difference between the market rate of sterling against the &quot; joint-float&quot; currencies and therepresentative rate-Currently fixed at a higher level for converting units of account into sterlingfor agricultural transactions. This difference gives rise to the payment of monetary compensatoryamounts (MCAs) which act as subsidies on our agricultural imports and as levies on our agriculturalexports. The forecasts assume no change in the differential (some 20 per cent) which existed betweenSECRET II
the two rates at the end of May. The Governmenthave, however, undertaken to keep the representa-tive rate under review and there are indications that the United Kingdom will come under consider-able pressure to reduce the present differential.2. Expenditure in Northern Ireland on price guarantees (except milk and wool), on productionand capital support measures, and on support in special areas is included in Programme 15, NorthernIreland.Market regulation wider the CAP3. This expenditure is incurred by the InterventionBoard for Agricultural Produce in implementing thesupport arrangements under the eec&apos;s common agricultural Policy (CAP) and the e.c. Food aid programme. Most of the expenditure under the cap, and all the food aid expenditure, is funded byadvances from the e.c.. The forecast for 1976-77includes  30 1 million as the cost of support buyingnet of sales and also provides  35 million for thecost of the Beef Premium Scheme, to which it isestimated that the e.c. will contribute  6 million.As there is no approval for the Scheme to extend beyond March 1977, a sum of  35 million has been added to the cost of support buying for later years.The 1976-77 forecast also includes expenditure of 140 million for MCAs on Intra-Community and third Country trade. The lower figures forecast for 1977-78 to 1980-81 reflect the recent agreementof the Council of Ministers that the exporting country will be responsible for payment of MCAsubsidies arising on Intra-Community trade after16 May 1976. The required option cuts on theUnited Kingdom funded portion of expenditure under this programme would be  2-4 million in1977-78 and  3-6 million in subsequent years. TheTreasury supports the Board&apos;s view that it wouldbe impossible to implement such savings sinceexpenditure under this programme is almostentirely governed by e.c. Directives and Regula-tions and cannot be unilaterally adjusted by theUnited Kingdom.Price guarantees, grants and support in special areas4. For price guarantees on products outside the cap arrangements sheep, wool and potatoes thefigures for 1977-78 and later years are conventional,being based on projections of the estimates for thecurrent year. The forecasts allow for the decisionsannounced after the 1976 Annual Review to improve the capital grants and to end the beef cow subsidyafter 1977 and the calf subsidy for calves born afterApril 1977. The figures for production grants and subsidies and for support in special areas aredeflated, they take account of the extent to which grants and subsidies at fixed rates lose their value as prices rise.Other assistance to agricultural production, foodprocessing and marketing5. The forecasts include continuing expenditure bythe agricultural departments on the eradication andcontrol of animal disease and on research and advisory services. The reducing level of expenditurein the later years is mainly due to the falling cost oferadicating brucellosis as eradication nears com-pletion.Fisheries support6. No provision has been made in the forecasts forany measures of restructuring required in the lightof changes in access to fishing waters or for additional research and development which may bedesirable as a result of such changes.Additional bids and estimating changes: Agricultureand Fisheries7. Expenditure on price guarantees and other formsof agricultural support cannot be reliably predictedsince it is demand-determined, and the figures forthese items are therefore subject to wide margins of error. The following table shows the additionalbids required for the maintenance of existing policiesor new developments:  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	SITotal additional bids	24-2	9-1	15-2	14-5	16-of which:					Price forecasting					changes	0-2	0-5	1-9	3-2	10Changes due to re-					classification      or					rephasing	13-6	 	 	-	 8. Throughout the Survey period the additionalbids are less than the downward estimating changesincluded in the Survey figures, and the difference is substantial in 1977-78 and later years.   The
Treasury point out, however that about half the downward estimating changes is accounted for bythe savings on price guarantees, which were takeninto account by Ministers in the 1976 price reviewdeterminations. Moreover, the figures for price guarantees beyond the current year are purely con-conventional (see paragraph 4 above).9. As regards the additional bids, the only itemclassified as rephased expenditure is the  13-million arising from delays in payments of thecompensatory allowances, introduced in January1976 under the Directive on Less Favoured Areas,with a consequent carry-over of expenditure from1975-76 into 1976-77. The other additional bidsinclude local authority capital expenditure on small&apos;holdings (arising mainly from reductions inestimated proceeds of land sales), the cost of supportvessels off Iceland together with provision for theagricultural departments&apos; share of expenditure bythe Ministry of Defence in protecting offshoreresources (already approved by Ministers), andother miscellaneous items.Offsetting savings10. For 1976-77 most of the expenditure of theagricultural departments is fully committed. Pay-ments of capital grants in 1976-77 will in generalbe in respect of proposals which have already beenapproved by departments. It would be unprecedent-dented for Ministers to seek to cut the levels of,for example, the livestock subsidies which they had announced at the previous Annual Review. It isfeasible to alter the timing of some of these sub-subsidies, e.g. by announcing that, solely because ofthe need for financial stringency, no payments of thebeef cow or Less-favoured Area (LFA) allowances in respect of the qualifying date of 1 January 1977would be made until after 31 March. This would reduce expenditure in 1976-77 by  22-9 million onthe LFA allowances and by  7-3 million on thebeef cow subsidy. But it would run counter tostrong pressure from the industry for early payments and would be likely to cause serious financial difficulties to some farmers. Moreover, the delayon LFA allowances would have to continue in-definitely if the additional expenditure were not simply to be pushed into a later year. As the beefcow subsidy is due to end after the 1977 payment,the saving in 1976-77 would produce a correspond-ing increase in the additional bids for 1977-78.SECRET11. So far as the additional bids for 1977-78 and later years are concerned, it would be feasible toreduce the rates of grant under the Farm CapitalGrant Scheme (FCGS), but the considerations setout in paragraphs 19 and 22 would apply. Reducingthe basic (20 per cent) rate of FCGs grant to about10 per cent would wholly offset the additional bidsfor the last three years, although the saving in1977-78 would be only about half that required.Part of the saving could be found from a cut in special rates (50 and 70 per cent) of grant fordrainage; a reduction of 10 percentage points would save roughly  2-4 million in 1978-79 and later years, with a saving of, say,  0-9 million in 1977-78.(Alternatively, if the policy options set out in para-graphs 13 to 22 below were not adopted, theycould be used for this purpose.)12. The agricultural departments consider that theadoption of any of these offsetting savings would run counter to the Governments present objectives and recently announced policies.Policy options13. Illustrative options for savings, as required bythe ground rules, are set out below and the practical and legislative implications are set out in thefollowing paragraphs.  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81(a) Lime subsidy termination	1-9	4 0	3-8	3-7(b) Farm structure schemes-re-				duction to minimum	0-4	0-9	0-9	1-0(c)  Research    ....	1-4	1-0	1-3	1-4(fl) Sales of land	0-4	0 9	0-7	 (e) Fisheries grants and loans 				limit to current level	2-6	2-9	2-9	3-4(/) Agricultural support (see para-				graph 19)   .	1-8	6-2	6-4	6-4(g) Additional savings on FCGS				uptake consequential on (/) .	0-5	1-1	1-2	1-2Total......	90	17-0	17-2	17 1of which: MAFF  .	6-6	12-4	12-2	121DAFS   .	2-4	4-6	5-0	50Savings required by ground rules .	90	16-7	16-4	16-2of which: MAFF   .	6-6	12-4	12 2	12 1DAFS   .	2-4	4-3	4-2	4-113
Lime subsidy14. The last Conservative Government decided to end this subsidy on 31 July 1974 but the decision was reversed by the present Government soon after taking office. The savings illustrated assume anannouncement following the 1977 Annual Reviewthat the subsidy would end at 30 June 1977, the endof the &quot; lime year&quot;. No legislation would be needed to terminate the subsidy. DAFS maintain that, in view of special problems in Scot/and, some alternative form of assistance may be necessary,particularly in the more remote areas with acid soil.Farm structure schemes15. Following the recent PAR study, agricultural ministers decided that these Schemes should becontinued, but not actively promoted, until the EECreview of Directive 72/160 in 1977. The savingsillustrated assume that these Schemes are variedso that they provide the minimum assistancerequired by the Directive. The Schemes are madeby Statutory Instruments which would have to be amended. Existing annuity commitments to out-goers would continue.Research16. The savings illustrated assume little growth inthe staff numbers engaged on research and develop-ment in agriculture and fisheries. The White Paper&quot;Food from our Own Resources&quot; (Cmnd. 6020)pointed out that the rapid growth in agriculturalproductivity had been materially helped by theapplication of research findings and that there wasneed for a continuing investment in the scientificimprovement of agricultural technology. the savings would be likely to hinder the realisation of potentially higher output, by limiting the amountof new work commissioned. DAFS would preferadditional cuts on this heading in preference tocuts on agricultural support as described inparagraphs 19 to 22.Sales of land17. The Minister of Agriculture could seek to sellup to about 7,000 acres of agricultural land. Mostof this land is tenanted and would therefore bedifficult to sell. Its sale to private landlords wouldbe open to political criticism. For these reasons,and because of the possible development value ofa small part of the land, the illustrative savingsshown are only a broad indication of possiblereceipts.Fisheries grants and loans18. The illustrative savings assume that grants and loans to fishermen are limited to the current levelof expenditure. These savings would be withoutprejudice to any additional expenditure needed ifthe Government adopts h new fisheries policyinvolving major restructuring in the light of changesin access to fishing waters and in conservationmeasures. DAFS would prefer to limit this option to 1977-78, since the uncertainties surroundingthe industry make such a long-term decisioninappropriate.Reductions in other agricultural grants and subsidies19. The options already mentioned do not produce the total illustrative savings required by the groundrules. The method of achieving reductions in other agricultural grants and subsidies would have to beconsidered in the light of the annual reviewsreferred to in paragraph 1. There are three areas where reductions could be considered: the guidancepremiums, the allowances paid in less favouredareas (LFAs) and the rates of assistance under the farm Capital Grant Scheme (FCGS).Guidance premiums20. These premiums are payable under EECDirectives to farmers whose development plans are concentrated on cattle and sheep for meat produc-tion and the rates are prescribed in the Directives.An amendment to the Directives would have to be negotiated in Brussels, making the rate of paymenta matter for national decision, and the correspond-ing Statutory Instrument would then have to be amended. The 25 per cent contribution from the eec would be reduced accordingly.LFA allowances21. The e.c. Directive on Less Favoured Areasprovides for the payment of compensatory allow-ances on cattle and sheep. In \975-76 theseallowances contributed about one-third of hill farmincome. The rates are set in cash terms and the survey figures imply that their real value is allowedto be eroded as prices rise. The level of assistanceto hiff and up/and farmers is a sensitive area anda reduction would be controversial. A reduction,say, at the beginning of 1979 would fall on the incomes of hill farmers at the time when these were beginning to feel the full effect of the ending of thecalf subsidy.  The feasibility of a reduction would
need to be assessed in the light of the prospects forhill farmers&apos; incomes at the time, A reduction inthe allowances would require amendment of theStatutory Instrument and the 25 per centcontribution from the e.c. would be reducedproportionately.Reduction in FCGS rates22. Statutory Instruments giving effect to theincreased rates of certain capital grants announcedafter the 1976 Annual Review, and restating the basic (20 per cent) rate, which applies to the generality of farm buildings and improvements, haverecently been approved by Parliament. It wouldbe feasible by means of a further Statutory Instru-ment to reduce the basic rate; but apart from thedifficulty of justifying such a change of policy, its possible effects on capital investment in agricultureand hence on the level of production and thebalance of payments would have to be considered.FOOD SUBSIDIES23. Food subsidies are currently paid on milk,butter, cheese, bread, household flour and tea. Asmall part of the butter subsidy in 1976-77 is paid from e.c. funds. The Survey figures assume thatone or more subsidies are phased out, and othersreduced, in 1976-77; and that the programme is thenreduced sharply, to leave some  56 million in thelast two Survey years to allow for any e.c.-financed subsidy which may be available at thattime.24. There is no additional bid for expenditure on food subsidies, but the Department of Prices and consumer Protection prefers to show compensatingsavings for bids on other programmes here. Thesecomprise:  million1976 1977 1978 1979 1980-77   -78   -79   -SO   SIPrice Commission                 25 10    10    10    1-0DPCP administration&apos; . - - 0 1 0 1 0-1Regulation of TradingPractice      0-3    -            -Total ....    2-5 1-3    t-[    l-l    t-t&apos; See Programme 4, paragraph 95.The necessary savings could be found by slightlyearlier cuts in the individual subsidy rates.SECRET25. Similarly, the illustrative options for reductionsshown in the table below include that required forthe Department of Prices and Consumer Protection^services (carried on Programme 4). The optionswould require a more rapid reduction in the subsidyprogramme.  million1977-78	1978-79	J979S0	1980-817-2	4-6	3 1	3 1FORESTRYImplications of Survey figures26. This item covers the Forestry Commission^activities in promoting the interests of forestry, theestablishment and maintenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. The Commission^ activities divide betweenthe Forestry Enterprise (a Government TradingService) and the Forestry Authority. The forecastsinclude interest on capital (increasing from 32-4 million to  41-9 million) and depreciationbut do not include the net surplus on Commissiontrading accounts which form part of the GrossTrading Surplus.27. The demand upon resources is measured by thecost of capital employed by the Forestry Commis-sion at the ruling Government rates of interest andby cash expenditure. Towards the cost of capital employed there is a subsidy to cover the differencebetween the target rate of return of 3 per cent set by the Government and the ruling Governmentlending rate. The interest remitted is calculated on the total capital investment, including the valueadded to the plantations through expenditure on maintenance and protection, and so increases eachyear. There are other subsidies on activities whichare not capable of producing the target rate but which the Commission undertakes for social reasons.28. The Forestry Enterprise is carrying out a com-bined planting and restocking programme of up to22,000 hectares a year of which about 18,000hectares is new planting. Over the Survey period the forest estate is planned to increase from about825,000 hectares to 915,000 hectares with a plantablereserve of about 90,000 hectares. Approximately600 kilometres of new roads will be constructedand about 10 million cubic metres of timber har-vested.    The  Commission  provides  substantial15
recreational facilities including camping sites and self-catering accommodation, information centres,picnic places and viewpoints with associated parkingfacilities, forest walks and nature trails.29. As the Forestry Authority, the Commissionundertakes research into all branches of forestry,controls felling in private woodlands and providestechnical advice to private woodland owners. TheCommission pays grants for planting of timber-producing species subject to the acceptance by theowner of obligations relating to the management ofthe woodlands designed to secure sound forestrypractice, good land use, environmental benefits and opportunities for recreation.Additional bids30. In accordance with paragraph 3 of the groundrules the 1980-81 base figures are the same as those for 1979-80. Additional provision of  3-4 million is necessary for this year as follows:  (i) Subsidies (4- 2&apos;6 million). Since the invest-ment on which remission of interest is calcu-lated automatically increases in value eachyear (see paragraph 28 above), the 1980-81subsidy element has to be increased from 40-8 to  43 4 million due to an increase of 2-6 million in the remission of interest ele-ment compared with 1979-80.(ii) Sale of land and buildings (H- 0-4 million).The 1979-80 provision of  11 million isexceptionally high as it includes a substantialreceipt for final settlement compensation inrespect of the Kielder Reservoir project. Theprovision for 1980-81 should be  0-7 million in line with the other years in the survey period.(iii) Increase in value of stocks (-4- 0-4 million).This includes interest at 3 per cent whichincreases each year with the continuing invest-ment in plantations. Additional interest of 0-4 million is required for 1980-81 comparedwith 1979-80. This will increase the provisionfor Increase in Value of Stocks from  18-1 million to  18-5 million.Offsetting savings31. To offset these additional bids by savings would involve a cut of some 14 per cent in cashexpenditure, and consequently a big reduction in capital investment, including the purchase of plant-able land. The Commission consider that thiswould affect the future planting and harvesting and marketing programme to a quite unacceptabledegree.Policy options32. Some 60 per cent of the forestry figures relatesnot to cash expenditure but to remission of interestofl capital employed which, as explained in para-graph 28 above, automatically increases each year as the plantations increase in value. Cash expendi-ture, on the other hand, is declining over the survey period. Reductions calculated on the total Surveyfigures would therefore mean that a progressivelylarger cut would have to be found from progressivelylower cash expenditure; and the cuts in cash ex-penditure would in each case be far higher than the2\ and 5 per cent required by the ground rules:  million		1977	1978	1979	1980		-78	-79	-80	-811.

To implement reductions calculated on thetotal Survey figures (line 4), representing cuts ofsome 6 per cent in cash expenditure in 1977-78 and13 lo 14 per cent in the later years (line 5), wouldmean a drastic alteration in the Commission^activities of progressively increasing severity. Thiswould involve the ending of all expansion of recre-ational facilities; cuts in expenditure on maintaining and protecting the plantations and on crop improve-ment (which would involve loss of future productionand the risk of increased damage); and a substantial reduction in planting and the acquisition of land.By 1980-81, the area of new land planted annuallywould have to fall by some 5,000 hectares to 13,000hectares; acquisitions would have to be reducedcorrespondingly, representing a cut of some 30 per
cent in the later years of the Survey period. Thereduction in industrial and administrative jobswould be about 400, or 5 per cent, by 1978-79;substantial redundancies would be unavoidable.34. However an alternative method, which theCommission believes is more appropriate andlogical, would be to take as a starting point reduc-tions of 1\ and S per cent in actual cash expenditure,i.e. total Survey figures minus remission of interestand planting subsidy. Reductions on this basis are shown in line 6 of the table above. They wouldinvolve smaller reductions in expenditure on themaintenance and protection of the plantations andon the provision of recreational facilities. Duringthe Survey period acquisitions of land would have tobe reduced by some 2,000 hectares and plantingwould be reduced in the last two years by about1,000 hectares per year. Resultant reductions in industrial and non-industrial staff would be about200 by 1979-80; some redundancies would be involved.SECRET17

This Programme covers expenditure by theDepartments of Industry, Energy, Trade, Prices and consumer Protection, Employment, Environment,Export Credits Guarantee Department and theScottish and Welsh Offices. The table oppositeshows the apportionment between these departments.The greater proportion of this is intended to lead to industrial investment or to encouraging industry toinnovate and to be more efficient.Policy options2. For the Department of Industry and the scottish and Welsh Offices the illustrative reductions requiredby the ground rules, and where relevant savings to offset additional bids, are considered for programme as a whole in paragraphs 3 to 5, 7 and 8 below.Policy options and offsetting savings coveringDepartment of Trade expenditure within this programme and Programme 6 are dealt with inparagraph 6. Policy options for the Department of energy are dealt with in paragraphs 32 and 60 andfor the Department of Employment in paragraphs 88and 93.SECRET 19  million		1976 -77	1977 -78	1978 -79	1979 -80	1980 -81Department Industry	of	969-3	955-2	918-2	863 0	802 9Department Energy .	of	236-1	199-2	178-3	165-9	161-4Department Trade	of	37-9	32-9	31-4	35-3	34-9Department   of Prices and Con-sumer   Protec-tion		146	7-3	7 0	6-8	6-8Department Employment	of	971-4	831-6	782-3	811-8	811-4Export   Credits Guarantee Department		378-6	449-5	517-7	527-2	509-3Scottish Office		116-5	85-2	86-1	89-2	85-6Welsh Office		26-3	32-6	36-2	38-6	38-other		112	12-3	121	10 5	8-9Total.      . 2,761-9 2,605-8 2,569-3 2,548-3 2,459-9
Department of industry. The total of additional bids on Department ofIndustry programmes is as follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80    1980-8140-7	20-7	32-4	33-8        28 1The Department must show how offsetting savings ofthese amounts could be made, and in addition, theyare obliged to identify optional savings of thefollowing amounts:  million1977-78       1978-79       1979-80      J980-8I23-0 44-1 41-3 38-34. By far the greater part of expenditure by theDepartment of Industry is accounted for either by continuing industrial support schemes or by projectswhere cancellation is the only effective option.Programmes containing any built-in flexibility are small and have borne substantially more than their share of recent public expenditure cuts; the Depart-ment do not feel able to seek further savings inthese areas. They are therefore looking to the majorindustry support services for potential savings of the magnitude set out above. Believing it necessary tocontinue to give priority to the National EnterpriseBoard (not), and counter-productive to make cutsin the industry support schemes that have only recently been approved, they would propose to find any offsetting or optional savings from the provisionfor regional development grants (RDGs). Over80 per cent of the Department of Industry&apos;s expen-diture on regional support is accounted for byRDGs, and if any cuts have to be made then itwould do least damage to the regional programme for RDGs to bear them all.5. Savings rising to  70-80 million a year would represent up to 25 per cent of forecast expenditureon RDGs. The simplest method of finding savings would be by a straight cut in the rate; a cut of1 percentage point in the rate of grant would yieldsavings of about  15 million. But this would harmindustry&apos;s confidence in the stability of regional in-centives, and would do nothing to concentrateresources in areas, or industrial sectors, of greatest need; nor would it offer any savings in administrative costs or manpower. These disadvantages could onlybe accepted in exchange for substantial savings.Alternatives would be to downgrade those areas where incentives are least needed, and possibly to exclude certain sectors of industry from the coverageof the scheme. For example, withdrawal of grant from the intermediate areas would save about 33 million. (If the intermediate areas were abolished altogether this would yield further savings on the selective regional assistance programme.)Exclusion of the non-mobile industries of construc-tion and mining would save about  20 million ayear, though in the latter case this would be incon-sistent with other measures to encourage exploitation of native mineral resources and could increaseunemployment in some areas. Both these measures would offer significant savings in administration. Inthe Department of Industry&apos;s view, savings onRDGs should be considered along with otherregional policies in the context of the current PARon regional incentives which is expected soon.Department of Trade6. The total of additional bids by the Depart-ment of Trade, including those within Programme 6,is as follows:  million1976-77    1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-813-8          4-2	3-4	8-6	2-0The Department does not consider that the reducedAir Travel Reserve Fund repayments or LocalAuthority expenditure on aerodromes on Pro-gramme 6 should be treated as additional bids ontheir programmes. Reductions of 2\ per cent in1977-78 and 5 per cent in later years would involvesavings of:  million1977-78       1978-79        1979-80       1980-8121 3-8 3-6 2-4A number of Department of Trade programmes arefee earning, and any reduction in expenditure islikely to lead to an equivalent reduction in incomewith no net savings. A number of other pro-grammes are required to discharge statutory obliga-tions. In the Departments view the only pro-grammes on which there is any significant flexibilityare tourism, export promotion, and support to the film industry. They do not, for these reasons, feel able to offer policy modifications which wouldresult in the required level of offsetting savings andoptions. They would however be prepared as a contribution to a general public expenditure savings
exercise to limit support to the film industry to the 5 million contained in the Prime Ministers state-ment of 29 March. For the 1977-78 total savingthe Department would propose to find about 1 million from the provision for support to filmsand around  1 million each from the other twoprogrammes. Cuts in the provision for films would save a further  7-4 million over the last three yearsof the period. In the Treasury&apos;s view, furthersignificant savings, of the order of a further 1 million per annum could be saved from thetourism programme without seriously jeopardisingthe Governments policy of support for the industry.Scottish office. The Scottish Office component of this Pro-gramme comprises the Scottish Development Agency(SDA), Selective Financial Assistance (SFA), the highlands and Islands Development Board (HIDB)and the Scottish Tourist Board (STB). Standardpercentage reductions on the two Boards would be feasible and would yield  0-3 million in 1977-78and  0-6 million in the other years. To achieve thefull quota of illustrative reductions it would benecessary to cut expenditure on the SDA (whichwould represent well over half the total of thereduction) and in Selective Financial Assistance.The savings would be as follows:  million	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81SDA	1-2	2-8	3-2	3-2SFA	0-2	0-5	0-5	0-5A cut in Selective Financial Assistance could onlybe made on a United Kingdom basis and would be controversial because of its potential effect on employment. A cut in the SDA provision whichhas been the subject of intense Parliamentary andpublic interest, would be highly damaging politically.Welsh Office8. Standard percentage reductions if applied to the welsh Development Agency would yield  0-5 mil-lion in 1977-78,  1-2 million in 1978-79 and 1-4 million thereafter. The Welsh Office take theview that the regeneration of industry is crucial to continue recovery in Wales and the provision for industrial support and factory provision could not therefore be reduced. The effect of the cuts would therefore have to fall on the provision for environ-mental improvement and development.   StandardSECRETcuts on selective financial assistance to industry would yield  0-3 million in 1977-78 and  0 6 mil-lion thereafter. Selective assistance to industry isdemand based and tbe options illustrated above would need to be achieved in line with a policy tobe decided on a national basis. Standard percentagecuts applied to the Welsh Tourist Board wouldgenerate  0 1 million in 1978-79 and 1979-80.These reductions would be, in the view of the welsh office, difficult to achieve in the light of currentpolicy to concentrate expenditure on the Develop-ment Areas and of Wales&apos; declining share of thetourism budget in recent years.REGIONAL SUPPORT AND REGENERATIONRegional Development Grants9. Regional Development Grants have been available only since 1972 and previous estimates were affected by a shortage of statistical data as wellas the inherent uncertainties in forecasting eligibleinvestment. More statistics are now available, butthe latest forecasts are still subject to a wide margin of error either way. They are slightly higher thanin Cmnd. 6393, giving rise to an additional bid of 9-2 million in 1977-78,  8-2 million in 1978-79, 16-9 million in 1979-80 and  26-9 million in1980-81. This is due to faster processing of applica-tions and a rising trend of expenditure. It wouldbe feasible to hold expenditure in 1977-78 to theCmnd. 6393 figures by processing applications moreslowly, but in the Department of Industry&apos;s view theobjections are overwhelming. It would also bepossible to hold the expenditure to Cmnd. 6393figures by reducing the rate at which grant is paid, orreducing the range of qualifying activities, orreducing the geographical area over which grants are paid. There are substantial objections to all three courses in the present employment positionand all three courses would be contrary to theGovernments overall industrial strategy. Neverthe-less if such cuts were necessary a reduction in the geographical area would probably be the least dis-raptive. It could also be argued that the disadvan-tages inherent in making any change, most notably in having to go back on undertakings to maintaincontinuity of incentives, could only be acceptable ifthe savings proposed were substantial. A reductionin the rate of grant by 5 percentage points forexample could be expected to reduce expenditure by some  80 million.21
Provision of land and buildings10. It is assumed that the programme of landacquisition and factory building, and the provisionof factories to industry&apos;s requirements will con-tinue. The forecasts are consistent with Cmnd. 6393after taking into account additional funds madeavailable in the Chancellors employment creatingpackages of September and February. Provision isalso made for expenditure of  11 million over the survey period as part of the interim strategy for the shipbuilding industry recently agreed by Ministers.Selective assistance to industry in assisted areas11. It is assumed that Section 7 of the industry act will continue to be the main source of selectivefinancial assistance for employment creating pro-jects in the assisted areas and for maintainingemployment in those areas in cases where therewould otherwise be redundancies. The forecast isbased on continuation of present criteria but willbe affected by factors which are subject to a con-siderable margin of error. The forecasts are consistent with Cmnd. 6393.Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies12. The provisions in Table 4 are consistent withthe approved programmes at 1975 prices of  200million for the Scottish Development Agency (SDA)and  100 million for the Welsh Development Agency(WDA) over five years. The main objectives ofthe Agencies is to accelerate the economic andindustrial development of Scotland and Wales andto improve the environment consistently with thatobjective. In particular they plan, develop, main-tain and manage industrial estates in Scotland andWales and provide advance and purpose builtfactories. The Agencies also undertake derelict landclearance programmes, where it is envisaged presentand planned levels of work will be increased, andthey will undertake major environmental schemes.The SDA will be playing a major part in a compre-hensive attack on urban deprivation, particularlyin Glasgow. The Agencies also carry out in Scot-land and in Wales the regional developmentfunctions of the not.Special assistance for rural and highland areas13. The provision covers the grant in aid to the highlands and Islands Development Board (HIDB)and the Development Commission. The forecasts for the HIDB provide for the same level ofexpenditure as Cmnd. 6393.Additional bid14. For the Development Commission there is anadditional bid of  5 million per annum from1977-78. The Chairman of the Development Com-mission is pressing for this increase primarily for employment creation to carry on and expand theefforts made possible in 1976-77 by the additionof  1 -8 million from special and temporary employ-ment creating programmes. This approach is supported by the Department of the Environmentwho are not however in a position to make extrafunds available from within their own resources.This proposal has not been discussed in detail withthe Treasury but in the Department of the Environ-ment&apos;s view a decision is essential on the level of funds for the Development Commission to imple-ment, in England, the decision taken by ministers in December 1974 that measures to stem ruraldepopulation should be increased when resourcespermitted, since uncertainty is making forward planning impossible. The figures also provide for additional expenditure of  750,000 in 1977-78 tomeet the costs of the dispersal of the Head Office ofthe Council for Small Industries in Rural areas to Salisbury as agreed by Ministers as part of theHardman proposals on dispersal.Policy options15. For the Department of the Environment theillustrative reduction would fall, in the short term,on the employment creating activities of Develop-ment Commission since these are the most flexible.This would conflict with the 1974 Ministerialdecision to expand the Commission^ activities, forwhich they are already significantly short of funds and for which an additional bid has been made.Regional employment premiumAdditional bid16. The following additional provision is requiredfor the continued payment of REP at current moneylevels to manufacturing industry in development areas:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-811-6	6-0	10-3	16-1REP is demand determined and this additional bidreflects revised estimates of the level of qualifyingemployment over the period. Expenditure couldbe held within the Survey figures by changing either
the rates of the premium, qualifying activities, orqualifying areas. All these would present sub-sfantial problems in the current employment situation. The Department of Employment areresponsible for practically all of this expenditure but the Department do not consider that there is any possibility of offsetting savings within their other programmes. The Department of Employ-ment are also proposing that the women&apos;s rate ofREP be increased to equal the men&apos;s, This would cost  35 million a year from 1977-78. The futureof REP is, however, under review.Policy options17, Expenditure on REP could be reduced by either reducing the level of the premium, the quali-fying activities, or the qualifying areas. Of these the most convenient, at least administratively, is areduction in the qualifying areas. The illustrativereductions would yield:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-815-4	11-4	11-3	12 1Residual expenditure under repealed sections of theLocal Employment Act 1972Additional bid18. The provision is for outstanding commitmentsunder the Act. There is an additional bid of 0-3 million in 1978-79. The figures for 1976-77and 1977-78 are below Cmnd. 6393. The increasein 1978-79, and the decreases in 1976-77 and1977-78 are a result of revised estimates of the phasing of residual expenditure already committed.INDUSTRIAL INNOVATIONGeneral industrial research and development19. The programme includes the Department ofIndustry&apos;s Industrial Research Establishments(IREs) and the Computer Aided Design Centre,work sponsored by the Departments of Industryand Energy at the Atomic Energy Authority andthe National Environment Research Council(NERC), contract support for industrial research associations, extramural contracts with industry andthe universities, and grants in aid to the DesignCouncil and National Computing Centre. Expen-diture at the IRE is expected to remain at broadlyits present level during the Survey period. Therewill be variations from year to year to reflect theSECRETincidence of major new capital items. ExtramuralR&amp;D now accounts for rather more than half thetotal programme.Technological and industry sponsorship20. This programme covers cost-sharing research and development contracts with industry, traiver-necessities and other research bodies, including somefinanced through the e.c. ( 0-5 million in 1976-77and  0-1 million in the later years); pre-production orders for advanced machinery and equipment;work by the NERC on mineral exploration; andmineral exploration grants.21. The United Kingdom contribution to the inter-national tin stockpile, estimated at  6 million, willbe a charge to this programme, and the phasing ofexpenditure between the years may need to be adjusted when the timing of this requirement isknown.Aircraft  and  aeroengine  general  research  anddevelopment22. The estimates in Table 4 do not reflect reduc-tions of  1-8 million in 1977-78 and  3 million ineach of the later years resulting from the transfer to British Aerospace of responsibility for research work relevant to its activities, see Programme 5,paragraph 3. The extent of the Department ofIndustry*s continuing responsibilities in these fieldsare under discussion with the new Corporation andthe above figures are therefore tentative. TheDepartment will continue to support certain otherresearch work, for example on air safety and thereduction of aircraft noise, and also work related to aero engines and aviation equipment.Concorde23. The estimates are related to the completion ofthe authorised 16 aircraft programme. No allow-ance has been made for receipts from the sale of aircraft other than those to British Airways andAir France.Additional bid24. The Department of Industry have submittedan additional bid for:  million1976-77	1977-7S	1978-79	1979-80	1980-8110-3	7-8	9-0	6-7	-0-223
The total increase of  33-6 million is the result of re-estimating the cost of the wort to be carried outon in-service development and completion of theproduction programme; and of the receipts from thesale of engines and spares to airlines. In a numberof areas the estimates are still not firm. Forexample, the extent of further development workwill depend on performance and utilisation of theaircraft in service.25. The bid includes expenditure on certain itemsnot costed in Cmnd. 6393. In particular, 5 6 million is included for certain spares and 2-6 million for engines in respect of aircraft notyet sold. Of course, no airlines would be preparedto purchase those aircraft without engines; and theDepartment considers that there would also be nopurchasers unless spares are available when theaircraft are delivered. The bid also provides foran increase of  9-1 million in the four years1976-77 to 1979-80 in respect of the Departmentspayments to the MOD Procurement Executive forwork carried out in the latter&apos;s R&amp;D establish-ments. These costs had previously been incorrectlycalculated by the establishments concerned.RB211Additional bid26. The Cmnd. 6393 estimates have been reducedby  3-8 million over the Survey period mainly asa result of a re-assessment of receipts. Anadditional bid has been made in respect of 1980-81.The estimate for that year is  1-1 million abovethe latest estimates for 1979-80 due to the incidence of expenditure on the RB 211-524.Other aircraft and aeroengine projectsAdditional bid27. The Department of Industry have submittedan additional bid of:  million1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-811-8 0-6 0-3 0*2 0 1This increase is in respect of payments to the MODfor the services of MOD headquarters staff in theadministration of Department of Industry aircraft and aeroengine projects. These payments are basedon a formula which takes into account certainaircraft expenditure and receipts on DOI Votes.The increase claimed by the Department flowspartly from the bid for increased expenditure on concorde but mainly from a re-interpretation bythe Department and MOD of the way in which theformula should be applied from 1975-76 onwards.The additional bid reflects different re-interpreta-tions of the formula for 1976-77 and for the later years. If the basis used for the latter years wasapplied to 1976-77 the increase in that year wouldbe only  1 -1 million.28. In the view of the Treasury there is no justifi-cation for changing the basis which the departments had used previously, and the following increases would be justified solely by reference to the applica-tion of that basis to the latest estimates of aircraftexpenditure and receipts:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-800-4	0-3	0-2	0-1Space29. Provision is made for the main part of theUnited Kingdom contribution to the european space Agency and for a small supporting national programme. The forecasts cover the contributionto the Agency&apos;s existing programmes and also provide, in the later years, for a contribution to future programmes. The balance of the UnitedKingdom contribution to the Agency, covering itsScience programme, is paid by the Science research council and is included in the provision for the research Councils (see Programme 10, paragraphs54-56). The purpose of the national programme is to maintain an independent source of research inorder to support the competitive position of theUnited Kingdom space industry.Nuclear energyImplications of Survey figures30. Expenditure could be contained within the survey figures only by substantial changes in ournuclear policy objectives as a result of Ministerialdiscussions on the fast reactor and the steamgenerating heavy water reactor (SGHWR) scheduledfor the autumn.Additional bids31. To maintain current programme objectives thefollowing increased expenditure is essential onreactor  systems,  our  manufacturing  capability

The illustrative savings required from theDepartment of Energy on Programme 4 could beachieved if the following cuts were made to ReactorR &amp; D in addition to those described in paragraph60.  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-813-4	7-0	6-4	6-4Cutting gross expenditure to eliminate the additionalbid and produce these savings would requiredecisions by Ministers to postpone some of the workon the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor(SGHWR) and cancel the fast reactor. cancellation of the SGHWR might yield a greater reduction in expenditure in 1977-78 and cancellation of the fastreactor would produce significantly higher reductions in all years. These calculations make no allowance for severance, etc. payments to Atomic energy authority staff who would have to be maderedundant on so radical a change in reactor policy.The implications for the plant manufacturers could also be serious. Ministerial decisions on these twoprojects are scheduled for the autumn.GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYNational enterprise board33. Provision is made for capital investment byway of share acquisition and loans by the national enterprise Board (not). Pending the formulation of a corporate strategy by the Board, the provision is arbitrary and will need to be kept under review.It is based on an allocation of the  1,000 millionprovided for under the Industry Act 1975 and is in cash terms.SECRET34. The  1,000 million is not the only importantsource of funds for not companies, who themselves are eligible to receive assistance under the industry act 1972. The provision for 1980-81 has been heldat the same level as that for the earlier years; ifactual expenditure matched the present provisionthen legislation to increase the existing financial limitwould be necessary before the end of the survey period.35. The Department of Industry view is that on present indications the annual provision will be inadequate for the not to fulfil the role envisagedfor it, but estimates of the amount that will berequired to enable the Board to meet its existing commitments are not yet firm enough for anadditional bid to be submitted at this stage.Selective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings;SECTION 8 OF THE INDUSTRY ACT 197236. The forecasts include, at Survey prices, expendi-ture of the  325 million in cash announced betweenJuly 1975 and April 1976 for industry schemes andaccelerated capital projects.  205 million has been allocated to industry schemes, including thoseassisting the machine tools, ferrous foundries and paper and board industries.  120 million has beenprovided for accelerated projects. Provision is also included for the Wool Textile Industry Scheme,begun in 1973.37. The forecasts also include  250 million (cash)for British Leyland, phased as follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-8130	60	60	50	50These sums are in addition to the funds assumed tobe available to British Leyland from the national enterprise Board ( 350 million).38. The Government agreed last year to provideChrysler (UK) Ltd. with loans of  55 million, tomeet possible losses over the period to 1979 up to amaximum of  72-5 million, and to guarantee aprivate sector loan of  35 million (with a counter-guarantee from the Chrysler Corporation). Currentprovision covers only the loans and estimated losses of  40 million up to the end oi 1976-77. any additional expenditure would be a call on the contingency Reserve.25
39. Provision is also made for minor rescue casesalready approved by Ministers.40. The provision made for the Department of energy&apos;s Offshore Supplies Interest Relief GrantScheme is sufficient to meet expected calls on thescheme in respect of existing contracts and projects.Provision for other assistance under Section 8 of theIndustry Act 1972 is limited to approved projects.Additional bids41. On the basis of the latest forecast, the Depart-ment of Industry believe that repayment ofassistance by ICL cannot start until 1979-80 andwill be at a lower level than assumed in the 1975Survey. The additional bid is for  1-6 million in1978-79 and  6-7 million in 1979-80. Rephasingof the paper and board and wool textile industryschemes results in an additional bid of  0 -1 million in 1977-78,  3-9 million in 1978-79. and  3-million in 1979-80. There is a corresponding reduction of  7 1 million in 1976-77.42. Further projects for assistance under Section 8would be a call on the Contingency Reserve, but theDepartment of Energy has agreed to try to workto a ceiling of  7 million a year. The OffshoreInterest Relief Grant scheme is currently underreview. Unless this review offers scope for savingsthere will be the following additional bids:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-813-7	7-1	9-3	14-7Promotion of tourism43. The forecasts include provision for the grants in aid to the British Tourist Authority and theEnglish, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards, and for selective assistance for tourist projects in develop-ment areas under Section 4 of the Development of tourism Act 1969. The forecasts show a smallreduction on those in Cmnd. 6393.Refinance of home shipbuilding lending44. This programme provides for the refinancingof part of the guaranteed credit made available bythe banks at a preferential fixed rate of interest to united Kingdom purchasers of ships built in UnitedKingdom shipyards. The purpose of the programme is to enable our shipbuilders to compete on equalcredit terms with foreign yards.  The refinancing isworked in conjunction with similar arrangementsfor export credit financing. The service is demanddetermined, and the refinancing depends upon thelevel of net shipbuilding advances, the level of export lending and the threshold (currently 18 percent of non-interest bearing sight deposits) belowwhich finance is provided solely by the banks.Additional bids45. The estimates are subject to a considerablemargin of error, particularly this year because ofuncertainties about the future levels of export lend-ing. Compared with Cmnd. 6393, the latest forecast for 1976-77 shows a sizeable increase, which has tobe treated as an additional bid. This is largely because of a faster rate of shipbuilding lending than hitherto expected. In later years, there are substan-tial reductions, mainly reflecting the expected declinein the industry&apos;s order book.46.  The additional bid is as follows:  million1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-81-1-23        +1 -15        -26 -Assistance to the shipbuilding industry47. Compared with Cmnd. 6393, the Survey figures have been revised to reflect part of the expenditureon the Interim Strategy for the industry agreed by ministers on 6 May. Cmnd. 6393 included anunallocated provision for shipbuilding assistance.This covers a substantial portion of the InterimStrategy. The remainder is now partly covered byan agreed claim on the Contingency Reserve. (Theprincipal element in the Strategy not covered isexpenditure on advance orders.)48. The forecasts for the first three years of the survey period provide for new merchant ship-building subsidies and a special redundancy schemefor shipyards workers. (The Interim Strategy also provides for additional funds for advance factories in shipbuilding areas, and these are included in theprovision for land and buildings under RegionalSupport.) The forecasts also include for 1976-77provision for capital support to Govan and CammellLaird under existing schemes, although (depending on the timing of nationalisation) not all of it may berequired. In addition there is a small provision forthe Cost Escalation Insurance Scheme for ship-builders, which runs on throughout the Survey
period. No provision is made here (or capitalexpenditure by British Shipbuilders: this is covered in Programme 5.Additional bids49. There is an additional bid on this programme as follows:  minion1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-8128 - 8-2 - -In 1976-77 this is due principally to rephasing ofagreed assistance to Govan and Cammell Laird. In1978-79, it is due to lower receipts because BritishShipbuilders will have taken over the Departmentspresent loan commitments, and because a further 4 million is required to implement the InterimStrategy (excluding any provision for advanceorders).Other support services50. No expenditure is provided for in this sub-programme by the Department of Industry though there is token provision for contingent liabilities inconnection with computer leasings, outstandingmarine insurance claims, and any liabilities whichmay arise as a result of agreements entered into bythe Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. the forecasts cover repayments of the QE2 loan, theex-1958-59 loans and the loans to Anglesey AluminiumMetal Ltd. and British Aluminium Co., Ltd. Thereare small variations from Cmnd. 6393 due torepbasing of the loan repayments.51. Following the recent decision by Ministers that new support should be made available to the film industry, the Department of Trade have made pro-vision for total expenditure of  15 million in cashterms over the Survey period. Support under existing legislation up to a total of  2-8 million is included within the total.52. Provision by the Department of Energy is sufficient to meet its current commitments providedguarantees in connection with oil platform construc-tion sites (up to  11*5 million plus interest charges)and guarantees to financiers of developers of north sea oilfields (up to  60 million plus interest charges)are not called. If the guarantees were called therewould be a claim on the contingency reserve.SECRETAdditional bids53. The Department of Energy&apos;s payment for thecost of oil rig guard ships cannot be met from within the existing provision. A further FuelEfficiency Loan Scheme is needed after 1977-78.  million1977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	-80	-81Oil rig guard ships .      1-8	2-3	2-4	2-3Fuel Efficiency Loan			Scheme                  -	1-9	14	1-0Investment grants54. This expenditure is for outstanding commit-ments under this scheme. The figures represent anadditional bid of  2-5 million in 1976-77,  1 -8 mil-lion in 1977-78 and  0-7 million in 1978-79. Theincrease is due to revised estimates of cost and to changes in the phasing of qualifying projects.SUPPORT FOR NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES(other than Transport Industries)Assistance to the Coal IndustryImplications c$ Survey figure55. Provision covers the contribution to the Mine-workers&apos; Pension Fund on the basis of the currentactuarial deficiency; also covered are payments inconnection with pit closures, the Redundant Mine-workers&apos; Payments Scheme and early retirementbenefits up to 26 March 1978.Additional bids56. The actuarial deficiency in the Mineworkers&apos;Pension Fund is likely to increase every year aspensions are increased to match the rise in the costof living. In addition, the intention is to introduce a Bill which, inter alia, will extend beyond 1978 the redundant Mineworkers&quot; Payments Scheme and grants in connection with pit closures. Some assist-ance to NCB towards the cost of stocking will benecessary this year and, most probably, next yeartoo, though the scale of assistance in that yearcannot yet be quantified. Some further unquantifi-able assistance, may be needed. Measures underconsideration include an assisted coal burn policy toreduce stocks and some form of regional grant tothe industry.27

These subsidies have now been phased out and accordingly there is no provision in the forecastperiod. The figure for 1975-76 represents a reduc-tion of  35 million on the provision in Cmnd. 6393.Other compensation59. Provision of  6-8 million is also made for there-adaptation benefits scheme for redundant steel-workers, which came into operation on 1 July 1974and offers a range of benefits. The forecasts showa reduction of  2-1 million on the provision in cmnd. 6393. Up to half the cost is met from ECSCfunds and these receipts are credited to &quot; Contribu-tions to the European Communities, etc. (net)&quot;under Programme 2.Other servicesPolicy options60. The Department of Energy&apos;s oil storage pro-gramme is under review. If the review concludesthat existing stocks could be disposed of thefollowing savings could be achieved:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-8111	1-1	1-1	11INTERNATIONAL TRADEExport promotion and trade co-operation61. Provision is made for expenditure on exportpromotion services which are managed by the british overseas Trade Board and subscriptions to inter-national trade organisations. Most of the expendi-ture represents assistance to British exhibitors atoverseas trade fairs, but it also covers the OverseasProjects Fund, technical help to exporters, assistanceto research education and training in overseas trade,and grants-in-aid and selective grants to non-officialtrade organisations. There is an additional bid of 0&apos;1 million in the years 1977-78 onward, reflectingan increase in the United Kingdom subscription tothe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Reanancing of fixed rate export credits62. The United Kingdom, like most of the mainindustrial countries, offers medium and long termcredit at a fixed rate for major capital goods. Thescheme also covers shipbuilding. This expenditure is the Export Credits Guarantee Departments(ECGD) share of the cost of refinancing that partof the fixed rate credit extended by the clearing banks for exports and home shipbuilding whichexceeds 18 per cent of Iheir non-inlerest-bearingsterling sight deposits; the share attributed to homeshipbuilding is met by the Department of Industryand shown separately (paragraph 44 above). Theexpenditure recorded represents the net addition torefinancing in the relevant year.Additional bid63. This is a demand-determined service, theamount of additional refinancing in any one yearbeing determined by two main variables: the net increase in the level of fixed rate export lendingin that year and the level of the threshold belowwhich the banks are required to finance the lending
themselves. As will be seen from the table below,the revised estimates are substantially higher thanthose in Cmnd. 6393, though they are subject to considerable uncertainty. Recently, the rate ofrefinancing has been increasing rapidly and if this rate is maintained for the rest of the year the claim on the Contingency Reserve could be considerably higher than the  130 million shown below.Net annual addition to ECGD&apos;s refinancing  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-SO	-81Revised estimate.	516-9	552-3	621-2	632-7	632-7Cmnd. 6393     .	386-9	452-3	521-2	532-7	Additional bids	130-0	100*0	100-0	100 0	100-064. These additional bids might be avoided byone, or a combination of three methods:(i) By imposing a ceiling on ECGD&apos;s futurecommitments under the scheme.(ii) By increasing the proportion of fixed rateexport finance provided by the clearing banks.(iii) By finding new sources of private sectorfunds for the scheme.65. Method (i) could be operated in such a way as to achieve an arbitrary reduction in ECGD&apos;future commitments, but unless this reduction wasmatched by an increase in private sector lendingcapital goods exports would be adversely affectedwith consequential implications for the balance ofpayments and employment. Whether or not method(ii) can achieve the necessary reduction in ECGD&apos;scommitments will depend on the outcome of arenegotiation of the current agreement with the clearing banks. This agreement expires in October1977. The immediate object is to secure an increasein the banks&apos; contribution to the scheme.  Method(iii) would necessitate discussions with other potentialities-tial lenders. There can, however, be no certainty that alternative sources of private sector funds willbe found.Policy options66. The options open to the Government which, ifsuccessful, might achieve reductions in future expenditure are set out above. Reductions of2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent in later yearscould be achieved by method (i) simply by cuttingSECREToff ECGD refinance at the appropriate level. Undermethod (ii) an increase in the bank&apos;s refinancingthreshold of 1 per cent of their non-interest-bearingsight deposits would reduce ECGD*s refinancingcommitment by about  100 million in 1977-78 andby between  10 million to  15 million a year there-after. A larger increase in the threshold wouldhave a proportionate effect on the level ofrefinancing.Cost escalation scheme67. The Export Credits Guarantee Department is empowered by the Export Guarantee amendment act 1975 to provide insurance against increases incertain costs of manufacturing capital goods forexport or performing major projects overseas.These powers extend to 26 March 1977 after which,if the scheme were to be continued, they need to be renewed annually by Parliament. The costingsbelow relate only to actual and prospective under-takings up to 26 March 1977.68. This expenditure represents the extent to whichpayments to exporters under guarantees, and administration costs, are expected to exceed theincome from premium. In 1976-77 premiumincome is expected to exceed payments; from1977-78 until 1979-80 net expenditure of  5-5 million is forecast with a small net surplus in thefinal year. These forecasts, which show lower net expenditure on the scheme than the Cmnd. 6393figures, are however, based on the present estimates of the rate of inflation, the continuing level of demand from exporters for the scheme and theextent to which they are successful in obtainingcontracts. All these factors continue to be subjectto a great deal of uncertainty.Additional bids69.   The following table compares the revised estimates with	those in Cmnd.		6393.						 	million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Revised estimate.	-1-8	2-9	2-1	0-5	-0-1Cmnd. 6393    .	-7-7	8-6	1-8	1-7	 Difference .	+S-9	-5-7	+0-3	-1-2	-Although the surplus of premium over expenditure is now expected to be much lower in 1976-77 theonly additional bid arises in 1978-79.  Since this29
expenditure in large part relates to commitments orcontingent commitments already assumed by ECGDthere is no way in which this can be avoided.REGULATION OF DOMESTIC TRADE ANDINDUSTRY AND CONSUMERPROTECTIONProtection of innovation70. Provision is made for the salaries and generaladministrative expenses of the Patent Office, forthe United Kingdom contribution to the EuropeanPatent Office, and for certain international subscriptions-tions. Forecast receipts from fees exceed expendi-ture, and overall the programme shows a net savingby comparison with Cmnd. 6393.Regulation  of  trading practices  and  consumerprotection71. The forecasts include the Department ofTrade&apos;s expenditure on salaries and general admini-strative expenses, less receipts from fees, inconnection with the Departments Insurance, Com-panies and Insolvency Service Divisions and theAir Travel Reserve Fund.Additional bid72. The forecasts take account of the increasedreceipts and savings expected as a result of theCompanies and Insolvency Bills now beforeParliament. Forecasts of receipts in 1977-78 and1978-79 are slightly lower than in Cmnd. 6393.This has led to an additional bid of  0-5 million and  0-4 million in these two years respectively.Repayment of loans from the Air Travel reserve fund Agency will be lower by  2 million in1977-78 and  2 million in 1978-79, reflecting areduction of  4 million in the Agency loan require-ment in 1975-76. The Department of Trade do notconsider that this reduction in receipts should betreated as an additional bid.73. The provision also covers the Department ofPrices and Consumer Protection^ expenditure on the monopolies and Mergers Commission support forthe National Council of Social Service in connectionwith the Citizen*s Advice Bureaux, the NationalConsumer Council, five nationalised industry con-sutner councils, the Royal Society for the Preventionof Accidents, and also expenditure on research onthe safety of consumer  goods.  The temporarysupport for certain consumer protection measures announced in &quot; The Attack on Inflation &quot; (Cmnd.6151) is included in the first year of the Survey.Additional bids74. There is an additional bid of  0-3 million in1977-78 only in order to continue for one year theLocal Price Comparison Surveys which form partof the temporary consumer protection measures announced in Cmnd. 6151. Any compensatorysavings will need to be found from the Departmenfsfood subsidies expenditure in Programme 3, para-graphs 23 to 25. There is also an additional bidof  0-7 million in 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80for the maintenance of consumer advice centres setup by special grant following Cmnd. 6151.Standards and quality assurance75. The main item of expenditure is the grant-in-aid to the British Standards Institution. provision is also made for the Metrication Board where it isnow assumed that peak activity will be reached in1977-78 (later than earlier forecast). Expenditureon quality assurance schemes and subscriptions to two international organisations are also included inthis sub-programme.FUNCTIONING OF THE LABOUR MARKETimplications of survey figures76. This programme aims to improve the func-ttoning of the labour market through the services provided by the Department of Employment, the manpower Services Commission and local authori-ties. The expenditure of the Commission and itstwo executive arms, the Employment ServicesAgency (ESA) and the Training Services Agency(TSA) is mainly financed by a grant-in-aid.Manpower Services Commission77. The Commission carries out its functionswithin a general policy framework agreed with theSecretary of State for Employment. Expenditureincludes temporary additional resources ( 80 million in 1976-77 and  33 million in 1977-78) to provide additional employment and training facilities to mitigate the effects of high unemployment. TheCommission also operates&quot; the Job Creation Pro-gramme on behalf of the Department
Employment services and employment rehabilitation78. The main expenditure is on the placing serviceof the ESA. Some 184 job centres were opened bythe end of 1975-76 and it is planned to open another142 by 31 March 1977 as part of a temporarilyaccelerated programme for the years 1975-76 and1976-77. Subsequently the Survey figures will sup-port about 100 new centres a year. Grants and facilities under the Employment Transfer scheme were improved as a means of assisting labourmobility in the special measures for alleviating un-employment; these improvements and the increasednumbers of persons expected to be assisted to trans-fer are covered in the Survey for 1976-77. Provisionfor certain PSA services previously on an alliedservice basis has yet to be transferred from Pro-gramme 14.79. A special grant of  1 million has been provided in 1976-77 to strengthen the Careers Serviceoperated by local authorities as part of the measuresto alleviate higher unemployment amongst young people. The forecasts of local authority expenditureallow for demographic growth.  3 - 5 million has alsobeen provided in 1976-77 for payment to employers of a recruitment subsidy for school leavers.Industrial training80. Additional provision has been made in 1976-77( 71 million) and 1977-78 ( 33 million) to assistapprentice and other training in a period of high unemployment. The effect of the improvement intraining allowances made as part of these measures will continue and is reflected in the Survey figures.The TSA&apos;s target for direct training, mainly in skill-centres and Colleges of Further Education, is 81,500in 1976-77 rising to 100,000 in 1980-81. Provisionfor certain PSA services previously on an alliedservice basis remains to be transferred from Pro-gramme 14.Redundancy fund payments81. Payments were made from the Fund to 363,000people in 1975-76 compared with 262,000 in1972-73, 157,000 in 1973-74, and 210.000 in1974-75. The forecasts assume a reduction in thelatter half of 1976-77 from the high level of pay-ments in 1975-76 to a lower level likely to continuethereafter. They also include the additional ex-penditure arising from the provision of theEmployment Protection Act for safeguarding sumsdue to employees in cases where employers areinsolvent.SECRETIndustrial relations and other labour market services82. This includes the Advisory, Conciliation and arbitration Service, the Office of ManpowerEconomics and DE staff engaged on manpowerpolicy, incomes and industrial relations work. Sub-stantial extra provision has been made in this programme for temporary measures to alleviatehigher unemployment.  91 million in 1976-77 and 30 million in 1977-78 have been provided for theTemporary Employment Subsidy payable to certainemployers who are prepared to retain employees who would otherwise be redundant.  63-1 million in 1976-77 has been allocated to the Job CreationProgramme which supports projects sponsored bylocal authorities, voluntary bodies and others toprovide socially-useful work for unemployed persons and particularly for unemployed young people. Thegrant to Community Industry has also been increased from 1976-77 onwards to raise thenumber of places provided for socially-disad-vantaged and unemployed young people from 3,000to 4,000.additional bidsEmployment services and employment rehabilitation83.  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-810-2	6-9	13-9	ISO	12 0Provision is needed for the dispersal of MSC andits Agencies to Sheffield, for which preliminary costs are now available.

Most of this represents a contingent bid for1977-78 onwards for the cost of introducing pro-posals for collective funding of initial training hiindustrial skills. The rest reflects a reassessmentof the costs of meeting existing TOPS training targets and some change in the balance of the programme.They involve extra staff (rising to an extra 1,100over present forecasts at 1.4.80), increased fees atColleges of Further Education hi 1977-78 and additional allowances (with associated administra-tive expenditure) in 1980-81, partly offset by reductions in discussion fees and in allowances in 1978-79and 1979-80.offsetting savings86. Offsetting savings to cover the firm MSC, ESAand TSA bids (including the costs of dispersal)would need considerable changes in most of theCommission^ programmes. For instance, the ESA&apos;sjobcentre programme would need to be cut by 25per cent in each year, the scope and usage of theEmployment Transfer Scheme by one-third and theTSA&apos;s trainee targets by some 4,000 in 1977-78progressively to 7.000 in 1980-81. However, theCommission would have to be consulted on theway in which any savings could be accommodated within its forward plans. Some savings to offsetpart of collective funding are possible but the figures are necessarily as tentative as those hi the bid.Industrial relations and other labour market services  million1976-77   1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980*411-0         2-9	2-9	2-8	2-887.

The Commission is financed bygrant in aid. As required by the 1974 Health and safety at Work Act, the Commission has begun theof rationalising the structure of the variousinspectorates and extending protection to some tmllion employees not previously covered by theAct. The survey includes provision for an increasein the staffing of the Factory Inspectorate. TheCommission has had to delay certain parts of its programme 01 developments and it will be sometime before it is able to meet all its responsibilities&quot;Oder the Act. Constraints on the level of localauthority expenditure is also likely to lead to delay-n those authorities taking additional enforce-Went functions under the Act.

The guidelines for the Survey did not require that 2\ and 5 per cent illustrative options should beapplied in detail to the investment programmes ofthe nationalised industries, but Ministers were told that the industries would nevertheless be asked to identify options of the same order of severity. Theyhave been pressed to do this, and the options whichwere identified are set out in the separate reporttogether with an assessment of the consequences of adopting each of them.British Aerospace and British Shipbuilder!!3. These new corporations are being consideredwholly within the Survey, le. they are not withinthe separate report on existing nationalised indus-tries. Accordingly an additional bid has beensubmitted in respect of the capital expenditure ofthe two corporations, assuming vesting dates late in 1976. This is an automatic consequenceof nationalising the two industries. It is notpossible to carry out a review of the likely futureinvestment plans and capital requirements of thetwo corporations before the corporations themselves have been able to formulate their plans on thebasis of information from the companies. Theestimates repeat the indicative figures mentionedin the text of Cmnd. 6393 but not included in the totals and represent no more than a broad pro-jection of the capital requirements of the vestingcompanies when in private ownership.4. The estimates do not include expenditure on research and development which is particularlysignificant in the case of British Aerospace as thisfalls on the revenue rather than the capital account.British Aerospace  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Fixed investment.	40	80	10-0	10-0	10-0Increase in stocks	and				work in progress	00	0-0	12 0	250	25 0	4-0	8 0	22-0	35*0	35-british Shipbuilders					Fixed investment.	.   200	50-0	500	50*0	500Increase in stocks	and				work in progress	6-0	60	60	6 0	6*0	26-0	560	56 0	56 0	56-0

Views on it are to be returned to the Department of the environment by the end of July. The Governmentare committed to make a subsequent detailed state-ment of their views on howtransport should develop.2. In addition the Consultative Council in Englandand Wales and the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities have been asked to examine andcomment on the Cmnd. 6393 proposals for localauthority expenditure.3. These consultations may lead to revision of the priorities set out below- which are essentiallyunchanged from those in Cmnd. 6393.
MOTORWAYS AND TRUNK ROADSImplications of Survey figuresenglandCapital Expenditure4. Although the reductions announced in Cmnd.6393 will be concentrated on lower priority schemes,the loss of economic and environmental benefit willbe considerable and the completion of an inter-connected network of high quality roads, will be delayed until the mid-1980s. Many roads schemeson which preparatory work has already been inprogress for several years and on which expectationshave been aroused will now have to be held back for to 4 years.Current expenditure . The reductions in expenditure announced inJuly 1975 are to be applied to all-purpose trunk roads but not to motorways. Motorway matnten-ance expenditure must continue to rise as more ofthese roads are built, and as much structuralmaintenance is required on the older stretches.For all-purpose trunk roads, spending on structuralrepairs is planned to be held steady at a low levelfollowing the increased expenditure in 1971 to 1974under the Marshall Programme, but towards the endof the Survey period the need for this type ofmaintenance may grow again, in which case thepresent provision would be inadequate. the reductions announced in July will mainly affect theappearance of the trunk roads and their ridingquality. If these reductions reduce safety margins afurther review will be required.scotland6. The cuts announced in Cmnd. 6393 have delayedthe completion of motorways in central Scotland andthe improvement of major roads which are not related to oil development. Procedural and other delays,some related to the postponement of Kessock Bridge,have meant that progress on the oil related routes,notably A9, has been slower than expected.wales7. The whole of Wales now has some form ofassisted area status. The motorway and trunk road programme has lagged behind that of England and scotland. In view of the importance of good roadcommunications to industrial development, effort is currently being concentrated on the early comple-tion of the M4 across South Wales. There remainshowever a need to improve east-west communicationsacross North Wales and it is intended to concentrateresources on the A55 in the later years of the survey period.Policy optionsengland8. The effect on capital expenditure of the illustra-tive reductions would be to delay certain schemes by  to 4 years and to prolong the existing delays onothers.9. On current expenditure the illustrative reductions would bring forward the time when there would bea reduction in safety standards especially as the effectof these further reductions would be cumulative.scotland10. The application of the illustrative reductions would mean significant further delays to importantschemes in the trunk road programme, including those related to oil development which have previously been exempt from cuts. reducing expenditure on maintenance would necessarily in-volve some deterioration in the standard of trunk roads. If safety were affected, the situation would need to be reviewed.wales11. The effect of the illustrative reductions wouldbe to delay part of the important A55 programmeor to result in the shelving of other smaller butdesirable projects.Summary of illustrative reductions  million1977-78  1978-79 1979-80  1980-81EnglandRoad construction 9 0 16-4Road maintenance 1-5 3-0ScotlandRoad construction 2-7 5-1Road maintenance 0-3 0-6WalesRoad construction   1-0Road maintenance J-0 1-016-63 05-10-616-53-1510-6201-0SECRET39
LOCAL TRANSPORTImplications of Surrey figuresENGLAND AND WALES12. Within the block transport supplementarygrant (TSG) system local authorities are free todetermine their own priorities, so the allocation of expenditure between headings in the local trans-port section of Table 6 can only be indicative ofthe main trends expected, especially in the later years. The extent to which existing policies can becarried out within the Survey base figures variesfrom service to service. Consultation on transport policy with the local authority associations andothers may require some revision of priorities. Forthese reasons no material changes are proposed for expenditure in England at this stage apart from anadditional bid for concessionary fares. However,there is likely to be great pressure on the Govern-ment for increases in certain items of local authorityCurrent expenditure and in particular for an increase to the level of revenue support for public transport.Such increases would have to be made at theexpense of capital expenditure although it is possiblethat they could be too big to be offset by savings in local authority capital expenditure alone. If theamount of revenue support decided upon is to beheld at the desired level, steps to ensure that localauthorities do not exceed that level may need toinclude legislation to restrict the discretion of localauthorities.13. Similar considerations apply to Wales, but aswitch of expenditure from road maintenance to road construction has been made to reflect the likelypattern of expenditure.SCOTLAND14. Inherited commitments and schemes essentialto safety, or to support housing and industrialdevelopment, together with the major GlasgowUnderground and Clyderail projects, take up most ofthe available funds. There is little scope for new schemes to implement the policies of the new localauthorities.Additional bidCONCESSIONARY FARES : ENGLAND15. During the RSG negotiations in late 1975 it became clear that the existing provision for 1976-77and subsequent years was inadequate because the data on which the estimates were based was inade-quate. The provision for 1976-77 only was increased by  9-5 million (1975 Survey Prices); thiswas partly provided from savings of  6-5 million(at 1975 Survey prices) on local transport adminis-tration. Local authorities were asked to reducefuture expenditure by 10 per cent below the forecast for 1976-77. But the expenditure in 1975-76 hasturned out to be higher than expected and it is now estimated that expenditure in 1977-78 and later years on existing Government policies is likely tobe at least  20 million a year above the presentprovision. The additional bid is based on this estimate. If, however, authorities spend as their1976-77 budget estimates suggest, expenditure would be over  25 million a year above the presentprovision. The Consultative Council has set up a working group to investigate current schemes; itwill produce revised estimates of cost by mid June.Subject to the outcome of this review, the optionsare likely to be:(a) Make additional provision to cover the costof continuing to leave local authorities withunfettered discretion in this field.(b) Find offsetting savings within the local trans-port block. Local authorities are likely to resist finding savings from other local trans-port services for an area of expenditure inwhich they believe the Government has con-sistently underestimated the cost. TheTreasury consider that if savings from thelocal transport block were insufficient, thebalance would be available elsewhere withinthe DOE&apos;s Roads and transport programme.(c) Take steps to restrain expenditure on con-cessionary fare schemes. As further circularsto local authorities are unlikely to be effec-tive, legislation would probably be required,but this would be strongly opposed par-ticularly by the metropolitan authorities, andit may be that any national scheme couldonly be achieved with a net increase in expenditure.Policy optionsENGLANDGeneral16. Any prediction of how reductions in localtransport expenditure would be applied by localauthorities can only be indicative.  The text which
follows is based on the arbitrary assumption thatcuts of 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent there-after will fall on each line apart from passenger transport subsidies to British Rail, current expendi-ture on car parks and concessionary fares. For these services no illustrative reductions are offered. to compensate, additional reductions have been madeto the provision for local transport-roads capitalexpenditure.Capital:Roads-new construction and improvement17. Whilst the illustrative reductions could beachieved without halting any road project already started the margin available for starting new pro-jects would be even further reduced, particularly in1977-78 and 1978-79 when a number of schemes would have to be cancelled or deferred. Coming on top of already severely restricted local authorityroad construction, the reductions would have a significant effect on the civil engineering industry.Car parks18. The reductions would require the cancellationor postponement of perhaps two medium sizedmulti-storey car parks in 1977-78 and three in eachof the following years. That the effect is so smallis due to the fact that local authority expenditure oncar parks has already been reduced to a low level.Public transport investment19. Investment in new buses is not directly con-trolled by the Government but is influenced by thenew bus grant. It is therefore uncertain whether in the short term the illustrative reductions areachievable. New bus investment was shielded fromformula reductions last year because of the Govern-ment&apos;g commitment to public transport The futureof the new bus grant is currently under review.20. The effect of the illustrative reductions on public transport capital projects would be thatvirtually nothing would be left for new projects to be started in 1977-78 and 1978-79.Current:Roads maintenance21. The Consultative Document on transport policy accepts that whilst maintenance standardshave to be reduced these should not fall below thepoint at which road safety is jeopardised or roadSECRETsurfaces break up. Further reductions might mean that these criteria could not be met In additionfailure to preserve the structural integrity of roadswould imply very heavy expenditure on their futurereconstruction. Cuts in maintenance expenditure would mean even greater reduction of labour forcesthan cuts on new construction.Car parks22. The existing provision assumes the doublingin real terms of car parking revenue between1975-76 and 1978-79. DOE officials judge that itis unlikely that this will be achieved and hence,it would be unrealistic to project a further increasein receipts. It is also unlikely that reductions in operating and maintenance expenditure could beachieved and hence no illustrative reduction isshown.Other current expenditure23. This line provides in the main for publicity andtraining for road safety. Local authorities have only recently become statutorily responsible for thisfunction which would make it difficult to ask them toreduce their expenditure on it.Local authority administration24.  If the illustrative reductions were introduced on local transport as a whole corresponding reductions on administration would be feasible.Passenger transport subsidies British Rait25. This line covers payments by PTEs in supportof British Rail services provided at their request.Because these payments are levied by British Railafter assessment of their operating deficits arisingfrom the PTE services, the consequence of a cutwould be either that British Rail would show a deficit on their passenger service or, more probably,that they would curtail or withdraw services. Noreductions are therefore shown.Passenger transport subsidies other26. Cmnd 6393 already envisages a 56 per cent reduction in revenue support for buses and under-ground between 1975-76 and 1978-79. This followsthe very rapid increase in subsidy in 1974 when fareswere in many cases held down while costs rosesharply. In 1975 fares rose on average about 50 percent and further substantial rises in real terms will benecessary in 1976 and beyond.41]68270
27. The possibility of an illustrative reduction onthese subsidies raises wider issues of the developmentof policy in this area where the Government is under some pressure and where there are real difficultiesin controlling expenditure. These issues will beconsidered in the context of the consultations on transport policy.Concessionary fares28. In view of what has been said above aboutconcessionary fares, no illustrative reductions areoffered.scotland29. It would be unrealistic to expect to achieve anyguaranteed savings on current expenditure: theillustrative reductions are concentrated exclusivelyon capital expenditure. They would mean cuttingout on average 10 per cent of all new schemes in1977-78 and later years. The effects would becumulative and programmes would be substantiallyset back. New schemes would be largely limited toessential bridge replacement and support of housing and industrial development.WALES30. Local authorities generally are claiming thathighway maintenance is at a practically irreduciblelevel and the illustrative reductions have been concentrated on highway capital works.31.  The policy options are summarised below:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-7a	-79	-80	-81England:				Capital				Road construction	8-7	14-7	14-8	14-8Car parks   ....	0-6	1-0	1-0	1-0Public transport investment	3*6	6-8	6-5	6-5Current				Road maintenance	8-7	16 1	16 1	16-other expenditure .	0-3	0-6	0-6	0-6Local authority administration	3-3	6-4	6-4	6-4Bus and underground revenue				subsidies ....	2-0	2-7	2-7	2-7Scotland.-				Capital				Road construction	31	5-9	6-2	6-2Car parks   ....	0-1	0-2	0-2	0-2Wales:				Road construction	2-3	4-7	3-8	3-8CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIESBritish Railway! Board32. The largest item in this block is support to theBritish Railways Board. Passenger subsidies enablethe Board to meet the public service obligation laid on it by the Government under the Railways Act1974 and, as proposed in Cmnd. 6393, are assumednot to increase in real terms over the Survey period.Transitional grants were introduced in (975 to meetfreight losses, which are not expected to be eliminated before 1978. The Board&apos;s historicpensions liabilities are also supported, includingfrom 1979-80 provision to put these pension fundson a properly funded basis. Total subsidies are:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81433-2	395-6	374-9	385-6	385-6Implications of Survey figures33. The Board are still examining the implications of stabilising passenger grant; but the consultative document on Transport Policy says plainly that substantial increases in revenue from fares and charges, and reductions in costs are essential-Elimination of the freight deficit by 1978 wouldrequire a substantial improvement from the currentposition and the Board have argued strongly thatthey cannot achieve this.Policy options34. As the pensions obligation is virtually inescap-able any reductions would have to fall on therailway business, as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-819-9	18-7	19 3	19-for the reasons given above it is uncertain whether these reductions are attainable at all and a decisionnow would pre-empt discussion of the consultative document.British Waterways Board35. The British Waterways Board receives grants under the Transport Act 1968 for essential main-tenance of waterways and improvement to modernstandards of bridges carrying public roads over them.These grants have been increased marginally above
Cmnd. 6393 (offset elsewhere) to reflect late changesin the Board&apos;s forecast deficits. A report recently received from consulting engineers endorses theBoard&apos;s opinion that support is still insufficient tomeet its statutory obligations. Policy for the water-ways is now under review in the light of both the consultants report and the proposal to merge theBoard with a reorganised water industry. In thesecircumstances, no increase in provision is proposed.Policy options36. This would entail the following reduction butfor the reasons given above may not be attainable :  million1977-7S      1978-79      1979-80      1980-810-3 0-6 0-6 0-6Scottish Transport Group37. The Scottish Transport Group receives grants for its loss-making shipping subsidiaries DavidMacBrayne Ltd. and Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd.,which run passenger and freight services to theWestern Isles and on the Clyde, and which have no prospect of increasing revenue to cover costs.Additional bid38. Additional provision of  0-2 million is sought in 1977-78 and succeeding years for paymentof grant to cover interest on loans to the Group&apos;sshipping subsidiaries. If this additional bid is accepted, corresponding reductions will be made from the Scottish Office*s provision for new construc-tion of roads and for ports.Policy options39. Cuts in grants would amount to  0-1 million in1977-78 and  0-2 million in succeeding years andwould require increases in revenue from fares greaterthan costs.National Freight CorporationAdditional bid40. The National Freight Corporation receivedtemporary support in 1975-76. The Minister for transport announced on 12 May 1976 that furthergrant up to  11 million would be paid for thecoming months. Subsequent requirements will beconsidered in the light of a report from consultantsSECRETbut in the meantime the NFCs investment pro-gramme has been reduced to allow for tokenadditional bids of  18-2 million in 1976-77 and 9 1 million in 1977-78.New bus grants to private operatorsImplications of Survey figures41. These are 50 per cent grants made towards thecost of buying new buses for use on stage services.Total investment in new buses by public sectorbodies appears as part of their capital programmes,and only the grants to the private sector are shownhere. The future of these grants is currently underreview. Present powers expire in September 1980and no provision is made beyond that date.Policy options42. The illustrative reductions would involvesavings of:  million1977-78	1978-79        1979-80	1980-81	0 1	0-2            0-2	0-2	It would be difficult to make a reduction in therate of volume of grant to the private sector without making an equivalent reduction in that to the much larger public sector.Other43. Grants are made under the Railways Act 1974towards the provision of facilities for loading orunloading rail freight. Table 6 includes only thepayment of grants to the private sector. Grants to public sector bodies will form part of their capital programme. Formula cuts in grants to the private sector would be  0 1 million in 1977-78 and 0-2 million in the later years. Any such reduction would cast doubt on the Governments commitment,reasserted in the Consultative Document on Trans-port Policy, to secure transfers of freight from road to rail where these are justified on economic,environmental or social grounds.PORTS AND SHIPPINGPorts44. Provision covers port investment by the inde-pendent harbour trusts and by local authorities,and grants and loans to ports in the private sector.Continuing investment needs reflect North Sea Oildevelopments, the continuing spread of containerisa-tion and growth of cross-Channel traffic and a43(68270L*2
variety of port developments designed to meetspecific industrial needs. The figures do not includethe costs of the Governments proposals for public ownership of ports and port businesses (see para-graph 49 below) nor for any special assistance to thePort of London Authority (see paragraph 51 below).Oil-related work45. Two major developments now in prospect, forwhich provision was not made in Cmnd. 6393, arethe further extension of the oil terminal at SallomVoe, and major new port facilities to be constructedin the Cromarty Firth in conjunction with the pro-posed Nigg Oil Refinery. The additional cost inthe Survey period of this extra work is estimated asfollows:  million1977-78       1978-79      1979-80      1980-810-5 3-5 19-0 18-8Non-oil-related work46. Port development, which would cost about 15 million spread over the years 1977-78 to1979-80, will be required if it is decided to build a new steelworks at Shotton. Pending decisions, no provision is sought for this development. other non-oil-related projects can be accommodated withinlower totals than in Cmnd. 6393, thus contributing to more than half of the additional requirements foroil-related work.Additional bid47. The DOE are therefore bidding for a net increase in provision for investment in ports,excluding Shotton, as follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79    1979-80	1980-81-2-0	-2-2	-1-6       -1-9-3	+S-6However, since only half the crude oil handled inthe Nigg Refinery would come from the North Sea,the Treasury have pressed for offsetting savings orfor reconsideration of the project and the means of financing the port development.Policy options48. Reductions of per cent and 5 per cent in later years would be as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-811-5	2-3	1-7	1-8Non-oil ports investment is already substan-tially reduced to accommodate additional investment in oil facilities (in 1979-80 oil-related work takesthree-quarters of the total) and the DOE argue thatit would not be possible to accommodate furthercuts.Ports reorganisation49. It is not possible to give firm estimates of the timing and cost of any proposals which might be putforward in the near future for public ownership of ports and port businesses. It is not yet certainwhen the necessary legislation will be introduced andthe cost could be up to  150 million or moredepending on exemptions and the terms of com-pensation.50. Acquisition of private commercial ports might cost some  60 million and of port businesses some 90 million spread over say three years. Inaddition the whole capital investment programmes of these ports and port businesses would count as public expenditure, at an additional cost of perhaps 5 million a year. A rough approximation of thetotal cost might be:  million	1978	1979	1980	1981		-79	-80	-91	-82	TotalAcquisition of private ports	50	10	___	_	60Acquisition of port busi-					nesses	 	30	30	30	90Investment programme of					former private ports and					businesses	-	5	5	5	15	50	45	35	35	165Port of London Authority51. There will also be additional calls for assist-ance from the PLA. The extent and timing of these requirements will not be known until the consultantsat present examining the Authority&apos;s financialposition have reported their findings to the Depart-ment. It is anticipated that these will give riseto demands of the order of  10 rnillion per annum.No provision has been included for this in this sub-programme.
Scottish ports53. The development of roll-on/roll-off facilities in Scotland must continue to be restricted; it is notpossible to envisage any major new scheme pro-ceeding in the years under review. The programmeincludes provision for a tanker jetty at PeterheadBay Harbour to service the new power stationnearby, and for the possible export of ammonianatural gas liquids. Expenditure on this facilitywill be matched by contributions from the pros-pective users of the jetty.54. It is proposed, if additional bids for subsidies to the Scottish Transport Group and Loganair are accepted, to reduce total PES provision in respectof Peterhead harbour.Policy options55. The programme of investment in harboursserving the transport needs of the islands, for which government assistance is available, could with con-siderabie difficulty sustain a cut of  0-1 million in1977-78 and 1978-79 by slowing down even more the provision of roll-on/roll-off facilities.Shipping servicesImplication of Survey figures56. This programme includes the cost of the coast-guard service, marine surveys, and measures for themaintenance and improvement of standards of safety at sea generally, including aids to navigationand measures to combat oil pollution. Also includedis the United Kingdom subscription to the Inter-national Maritime Consultative Organisation(IMCO), and a number of miscellaneous services.Additional bids57. There is an additional bid on this programme as follows:  million1977-7S	1978-79	1979-80	1980-810-6	0-9	0-7	19This is required partly to offset a shortfall in thelevel of receipts from fees as compared with thatforecast in Cmnd. 6393, and partly to meet the costs of the reorganisation of the coastguard for whichSECRETthere is at present no provision beyond 1977-78.The additional bid for 1980-81 includes provisionfor the expected increase in the United Kingdomsubscription to IMCO when the proposed new head-quarters building in London is completed: this hasbeen specifically agreed by Ministers.CIVIL AVIATION SERVICESCAA granf-in-aidImplications of Survey figures58. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been set the financial objective of recovering its costs andsecuring a reasonable return on capital from thosewho benefit from its services as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the Authority&apos;s deficit on revenue account is being met by grant-in-aid.Additional bids59. The Department have made net additional bidsas follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-803-3	1-0	-0-1	6-3The CAA&apos;s present forecasts of grant requirements have increased mainly because of decisions reachedlast autumn by Member States of euro control aboutthe basis of cost recovery for en route navigationalservices. United Kingdom delegates secured some,but not all, of the changes which it was hopedwould accelerate cost recovery. The present figuresassume further negotiating successes.60. The CAA has also made a bid for anadditional grant of  3-3 million in 1976-77 to finance a premature retirement scheme which isestimated to yield savings of  1 -1 million in each ofthe years 1977-83.61. These two factors result in the net bid setout above, which is under discussion with theTreasury.Capital investment by the CAAImplications of Survey figures62.  This programme is being considered in the separate report to Ministers on the investment pro-grammes of the nationalised industries.45
Additional bids63. The review of the CAA programme suggeststhat there will be net savings over the period made up as follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80-3-4	-11	0*8	-0-4Policy option64. The option described in the nationalised industry Investment Review is a cut of  2-5 millionspread over the four years 1977-78 to 1980-81(split  0-5 million,  0-6 million,  0-7 million and 0-7 million), mainly by a further rephasing ofair traffic control (ATC) capital expenditure. Thiswould result in rather higher revenue costs falling on airlines, including British Airways, because ofsomewhat greater ATC delays, and higher revenuecosts falling on the CAA because of the greatermaintenance costs of equipment subject to delayedreplacement.Local authority capital expenditureImplications of Survey figures65.  The programme relates mainly to develop-ments at Manchester and Birmingham airports.Additional bids66. The local authorities forecasts of expenditurehave been adjusted by the Department of Trade forrealism and in the period 1976-1980 the programme is some  17 million below Cmnd. 6393 although in one year there is an additional bid of  1-5 mil-lion. The breakdown is as follows:  million1976-77      1977-78      1978-79      1979-80-6*5 -11-6 -0-3 15Other civil aviation servicesImplications of Survey figures67. The forecasts provide for expenditure onaviation security measures, the cost of UnitedKingdom subscriptions to euro control and to theInternational Civil Aviation Organisation, and various minor services in the United Kingdom and overseas, including a subsidy from the scottish office to Loganair for operating third level air ser-vices to the Highlands and Islands.Additional bids68. Within the total, an increase in the forecasts for aviation security measures is more than offset by increased receipts over the period as a whole, butthere is an additional bid of  0-5 million in1976-77 for extra expenditure on aviation security.This bid is under discussion between the treasury and the Department.69. The Scottish Office have bid for PES provisionfor the Loganair subsidy of  0 1 million a year for the period 1977-80 and have confirmed thatoffsetting savings would be made from their pro-vision for new construction of roads and ports.70. The net additional bids for aviation services areas follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-800-5	-0-5	-1-3	-1-other TRANSPORT SERVICES71.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE SURVEY FIGURESengland1. About two-thirds of expenditure on the housing programme is not subject to control. The pro-gramme is therefore particularly subject to estimatingchanges. The following table sets out changes fromthe Survey figures that at the start of the Surveywere estimated to be needed to carry out existing policies:  million7976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81Subsidies .	48 0	40	-70-8	-112-5	-108-5Rent rebates and					allowances	5*4	16-1	61-4	66-9	80-9Option   mortage					scheme .	4 1	IS	-5-0	-29-4	-34*new					housebuilding	134-7	54-8	-26-8	-56-2	-711Loans and grants					to private sector					including Hous-					ing Associations					(net)	-17-9	26-7	-4-9	-49-3	-49-8Improvement and					other    invest-					ment	6-5	11*6	11-5	11-5	11-5Administration .	-	-2-1	-10	0 1	0 1	180-8	112-9	-35-6	-168-9	-171*32. The increases arise largely from a speeding up and an enlargement of (uncontrolled) local authoritynew housebuilding (see paragraphs 17 to 19 below);and the decreases from a fall in forecast interest rates from those assumed in Cmnd. 6393. Theestimates assume that, as was implicit in thefigures in Cmnd. 6393, legislation will be introduced to reduce Exchequer subsidies; and that there willbe an increase in council house sales greater thanthat likely to arise under present guidance to localauthorities.Subsidies3. A new forecast of local authority and NewTown housing revenue accounts (HRAs) has beencarried out incorporating the following revisedassumptions from those underlying Cmnd. 6393.(i) New investment and council house sales areassumed to follow the course described inparagraphs 17 to 21 below, resulting in a net increase in the council housing stock of about\ per cent a year over the period.(ii) The local authority pool rate falls from10-4 per cent in 1976-77 to 8 4 per cent in1980-81. (Cmnd. 6393 assumed a fall from10-6 per cent in 1976-77 to 9-6 per cent in1979-80.)(tii) Management and maintenance costs riseproportionately with the forecast earningsindex in 1976-77 (as assumed in the rate support grant settlement), and thereafter riseat 2 per cent a year faster than the earningsindex (about 2 per cent a year less thanassumed in Cmnd. 6393). This assumptionmay well prove over-optimistic.Of these assumptions the most critical is that made about interest rates. The size of local authority housing debt is such that a 1 per cent rise in theaverage interest rate now costs about  130 million(England).4. Like the Cmnd. 6393 figures, the forecastassumes that council house rents rise in both1977-78 and 1978-79 at a rate about 10 per centfaster than the Consumer Price Index. In money terms this requires average unrebated local authorityrents in England to rise as follows:Average standard unrebated rent,   a week1975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79   1979-80   1980-814-33       4-91      5-S5 6*93      7*36 7-705. These increases entail legislation early in the1976-77 Session since they cannot be achieved with-out amendment to the Housing Rents and SubsidiesAct 1975. Without such legislation most authorities would receive sufficient Exchequer subsidy in1977-78 to need only a modest rent increase of around 40 pence a week. The only authorities that could next year make rent increases of over90 pence a week without making &quot; profits &quot; on theirHRAs (which is not allowed under the Act) arethose such as the inner London boroughs with large deficits presently met by rate fund contributions,or with relatively expensive housing programmes.Thus without legislation the likely overspend fromthe Survey figures would increase by a further 80 million in 1977-78 and  200 million in thefollowing years.6. The Secretary of State for the Environment hasquestioned the political feasibility of legislation andwill arrange for the matter to be discussed atSECRET 51
Ministerial level in advance of the conclusions ofthe Survey. Moreover, without special measuresthere could be no way of ensuring that localauthorities did not increase rate fund contributions to mitigate rent increases. For illustration it mightbe assumed that there would be real increases of5 per cent a year in 1977-78, 1978-79 and1979-80 rather than 10 per cent in each of the first two years. But this would still require legislation;and expenditure on subsidies would exceed thefigures in paragraph 1 above by  40 million in1977-78,  100 million in 1978-79, and  55 million in 1979-80 and 1980-81.Rent rebates and allowances7. The forecast of rebates assumes that the propor-tion of council tenants in receipt of rebates remainsconstant in years when rent increases are in line with general price increases. However, in 1977-78and 1978-79 the 10 per cent increases in real rentswill be reflected in an increase in the proportion of tenants eligible for rebate under present rebatepolicies. This is responsible for the increases inestimated rebate payments in those and following years. This factor was not fully taken into account in the figures in Cmnd. 6393.Option mortgage subsidy8. The reduction in later years largely reflectsrevised interest rate assumptions.Grants and loans to housing associations9. This programme has been increased substan-tially in recent years in accordance with the policyof expanding the contribution of the housing associa-tions to supplement the local authority housingeffort, especially in the housing stress areas. TheHousing Corporation has been strengthened in orderto undertake the general supervision of housing associations.10. Finance for housing association projects ischannelled mainly through the Housing Corpora-tion and to a lesser extent through local authorities;local authority schemes have recently had to bereduced drastically in number to help to ensure thatthe expenditure provision in Cmnd. 6393 is notexceeded. The numbers of approvals that underliethe current programme are set out in the followingtable.Housing Corporation        Local AuthorityFinanced FinancedNew Improve- New Improve-building       ment building           ment1976-77 and later         22,000      10.000 3,000          4,00011. It is now estimated that these approvals will lead to the increases shown in expenditure in 1976-77and 1977-78, and decreases in subsequent years.This arises largely from a shift from new building toimprovement schemes, which are completed more quickly, bringing expenditure forward from later toearlier years.Local authority housing improvement, municipalisa-rion and lending to private purchasers12. These three programmes are all now directed towards improvement in the condition of the olderhousing stock.13. The figures in Cmnd. 6393 implied a sharpdecline in activity in improvement and municipalisa-tion from 1977-78 onwards with lending at a relatively high level. To provide a more realisticbasis for estimation, provision for improvement andmunicipalisation has been increased and provisionfor local authority lending correspondingly reduced.14. Both improvement and municipalisation are essential features in the policy of gradual renewal ofinner urban areas which has replaced the former lesssensitive and frequently more expensive policy oflarge scale clearance and redevelopment. A study group with the local authority associations andchaired by the Minister for Housing and Construc-tron was set up in 1975 to assemble evidence onneeds for municipalisation and for renovating council-owned dwellings, and to advise on priorities. TheGroup has advised that there is a need for expenditure on improvement and municipalisation atthe levels now indicated.15. Local authority home loans are now running ata substantially lower level than of recent years.Authorities are now acting, in effect, as lenders oflast resort, and are concentrating their lendingmainly on older properties. Lending has thus become another element in the campaign to preventolder housing from deteriorating, as well as helping to give people an opportunity to become owneroccupiers at the cheapesf^end of the market. Whilstconsiderable efforts have been made to persuade the
building societies to play a larger role in this lendingarea they need to have proper regard to their statutoryresponsibilities and to the interests of their investors.Private sector improvement grants16. Grant applications are currently running at a level well below the level in 1974-75. A numberof factors have contributed to the fall-off in applica-tions for improvement grants, but the main reason isprobably the restrictive conditions introduced underthe Housing Act 1974 in an attempt to direct the grants more closely to areas of greatest need. Inthe view of the DOE these restrictions haveunintentionally impeded the implementation of thepolicy underlying the 1974 Act.New housebuilding17. The expenditure figures for new dwellings andassociated land purchase allow for a programme ofnew dwellings approved each year by local authoritiesand New Towns as follows:Thousands of dwellings	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980England					Local Authorities	t08*0	100-0	100-0	1000	1000New Towns	15-0	14-0	13-5	12-5	12-5Compared with Cmnd. 6393, the local authorities&apos;approvals for England are up by 6,000 in 1975 and,000 in the first quarter of 1976. Because of theshortage of work in the building industry houses arebeing started sooner after tender acceptance andbuilt faster once started. This has brought expendi-ture forward into earlier years. As a result of allthese factors forecast expenditure for local authori-ties in 1976-77 is  131 million above Cmnd.6393-and in 1977-78  69 million. Converselythere will be savings in 1978-79 and 1979-80.18. The increase in the rate of approvals this yearmay have been due to the bringing forward ofschemes before the district council elections on6 May. The widespread change of control resultingfrom those elections is likely to mean a fall in thefuture rate of approvals. They may therefore not reach the 108,000 assumed, and could well fall belowthe 100,000 assumed for later years. A fall to90,000 in 1977 would reduce the overspend in1977-78 from  69 million to  37 million with substantial savings in later years. On the other handa projection of approvals at the current rate of increase would suggest a total of more than 120,000in 1976, with large additional expenditure as a result.SECRETSale of council houses19. The figures assume a large increase in sales of council houses. They require either about 10,000new dwellings built by local authorities to be sold(building for sale) in 1977-78 and about 15,000 ayear thereafter; or about 12,000 existing councildwellings to be sold in 1977-78 and 20,000 a yearthereafter; or some intermediate combination ofbuilding for sale and sales of existing dwellings.They also require that most purchases should be financed by building societies, instead of by localauthorities as present.20. The present annual rates of sales are about 500built for sale and 2,000 existing houses; and only25 per cent of the finance is estimated to come from private sources. Some of the new district councils are likely to be more disposed towards sales than their predecessors; and there is also likely to be some increase in building for disposal on the basis of&quot; half and half&quot; schemes of the Birmingham type.It may also be possible to secure greater building society involvement than in the past. On this basis,and with new guidance from the Government, the projected level of receipts in 1976-77 ( 68 million)might be achieved throughout the period without increasing the relatively small provision made forsales being financed by local authorities. To reach the higher level of receipts from sales assumed in later years will require wider initiatives.21. The possibility of new initiatives on the disposalof existing council houses has already beenconsidered by Ministers; and several schemes are under consideration in the context of the housing finance Review. There must remain doubts howeverwhether in the expected economic situation as many as 20,000 houses a year would be sold, so that the savings forecast on new building in 1978-79 and later years could thus be reduced, at least in part, bya shortfall in sales.SCOTLAND22. The Scottish programme is subject to esti-mating changes for the same reasons as in England.The following table sets out the changes from the survey figures now estimated to be needed to carryout existing policies in Scotland:  million1976-77	1977-78  1978-79 1979-80	1980-81Subsidies		and rebates -8-4	-13-9    -15-6    -16-7	4-7-1S3
These changes reflect the same factors that affectthe English programme, subject to the points dis-cussed below.Subsidies23. The figures take account of the effects on sub-subsidies of the lower estimates for new housebuildingin Scotland, and increased sales forecasts agreed inthe 1975 Survey. The rents implied in Scotland bythe policy of 10 per cent real increases in 1977-78and 1978-79 are as follows:Average standard unrebated rent,   a week1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79   1979-80	1980-812-90	3-40	4-04	4-73       5 00	5-23Legislation will be required in 1977-78 if thesefigures are to be achieved, and even then there couldbe no guarantee that local authorities wouldactually make such increases.Grants and titans to housing associations24. Provision is made for a small programme ofnew building by housing associations and a largerprogramme of rehabilitation. This allows for a programme of approvals for the Housing Corpora-tion of 1,000 new build schemes a year until 1978-79and 1,200 subsequently, and 3,000 rehabilitationschemes a year; and for 400 local authority schemesa year divided equally between new build and rehabilitation.New housebuilding25. Investment in new public sector dwellings,which takes account of reductions made in cmnd. 6393, assumes a modesUy increasing pro-gramme of new dwellings approved over the survey period as follows:Thousands of dwellings	/976	1977	1978	1979	1980Local authorities	13-3	13-5	14-5	14-5	14-5New towns	2-7	2-8	2-3	2-8	2-8Scottish Special Housing					Association .	3-0	3-2	3-2	3-2	3-2Sales26. For Scotland a significant increase in councilhouse sales was implied in Cmnd. 6393, though a lesser increase than in England. To achieve the target will require some relaxation of existingguidance to local authorities, and a change of policy by some of the larger authorities.WALES27. The figures for Wales are discussed separately in paragraphs 33 to 38 below.ENGLANDADDITIONAL BIDS28. The estimating changes set out in the table inparagraph 1 and discussed in paragraphs 1 to 21 giverise to net additional expenditure over the survey period as follows:  million1976-77      1977-78      1978-79      1979-80      1980-81181 113 -36        -169 -171It should be noted that:(i) Especially for the later years the figures are subject to wide margins of error. They arerevised at frequent intervals, and are based on current economic assumptions about interest rates and inflation. They are also sensitive to demand (eg. for rent rebates and optionmortgages), to the state of the private housingmarket, and to local authority investmentdecisions.(ii) As noted in paragraph 5, if legislation cannotbe obtained to withdraw subsidy in 1977-78there would be additional expenditure of upto  80 million rising to  200 million in1978-79 and later years if it still remainedimpossible to obtain legislation.For 1976-77 Ministers have agreed to savings of 28-5 million on improvement grants and  25-6 mil-lion on municipalisation. Possible further savingsare being discussed separately by Ministers in the context of this year&apos;s Contingency Reserve. the prospective additional expenditure of  113 million in 1977-78 might be offset in a number of ways andthese are discussed below.29. DOE drew attention to tbe uncertainties in thefigures. Among these are:(i) If there were a fall in the rate of approvalsfor Jocal authorities&apos; new building, that could produce savings of up to about  30 million.
(ii) A larger number of council and New Townhouses might be sold than the 12,000 assumed in the Survey.(iii) There is also the possibility that if legislation on subsidies is obtained on time it might be feasible to achieve larger savings thanassumed in the Survey figures, e.g. anadditional rent increase of 15 pence would save  25 million.30.  There are obvious difficulties in relying on anysuch savings.   Items (i) and (ii) are subject to no control, and if anything the uncertainties in expendi-ture seem to be in the other direction (see para-graphs 17 to 21 above). The problems with item (iii)are fully discussed in paragraph 6 above.31.  In the circumstances offsetting savings would therefore probably have to come as follows:(a) Entitlement to rent rebates and allowancesmight be reduced by appropriate adjustment to the needs allowance, possibly saving a sumof the order of  10 million. Early decisions will be needed if this option is to be pursued.(b) Cuts might be made in spending on muni-cipalisation, mortgage lending, improvement grants and improvement investment.  Whilstadministratively, cuts in these areas are theeasiest to impose, DOE believe that for thereasons set out in earlier paragraphs, theseare high priority programmes which should asfar as possible be protected.   Neverthelessif other savings did not materialise this iswhere the balance of  103 million would need to be found.Scotland32. The estimating changes for Scotland set out inthe table in paragraph 22 give rise to net additional expenditure of  7 million in 1980-81. The scottish office suggest that this could be offset by intro-ducing and exercising in good time controls overnew housebuilding to achieve the required saving.Wales33. The factors described above for the housing programme in England by-and-large apply to thehousing programme in Wales, subject to the follow-ing points.34. The rate of new housebuilding has been signi-ficantly greater than was previously forecast; andthis has led to substantial excesses in capitalexpenditure and subsidies in 1976-77 and later years. Some of the addition has been accepted as aSECRETcharge to the Contingency Reserve; and savingshave also been found in 1976-77 by applying strictcontrols to local authority lending. In consequence:(a) It has not been possible in Wales to shiftexpenditure into municipalisation and improvement investment as in England; and(b) The purchase of older houses in need of repairhas slowed down, and there has been afalling off in improvement grants to theprivate sector.35. The result has been that rehabilitation of oldstock through municipalisation and progress withaction areas are falling behind the rate of progress which the Welsh Office consider necessary to dealwith the large proportion of old and unfit houses in wales.36. The current rate of completions and approvalsof new houses (7,500 a year compared with 6,500assumed in Cmnd. 6393) is now expected to con-tinue throughout the Survey period. It is possiblethat the changes in the control of the district councils following the elections in May will have some effect upon the future rate of building; but inview of the age and high rate of unfitness in the welsh housing stock the new councils will remain under considerable pressure to maintain a buoyanthousebuilding programme. There is also a pro-gramme of 1,000 new build and 500 rehabilitationhousing association approvals each year, all financedthrough the Housing Corporation. For new building in new towns in Wales provision needs to be madefor 900 approvals in 1976-77 and, on average overthe later years, for about 500-600 approvals eachyear.37. Against this background, the Welsh Office hasmade the following bids for additional expenditureon open-ended and demand-determined parts ofthe Welsh housing programme.  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Subsidies	2 0	11-5	7-7	4-9	4-6Rent rebates and					allowances	0 2	17	4-4	4-6	5-5Option mortgage					subsidy	 	0-4	0-5	0-4	11New housebuilding .	 	25-2	31 0	31-4	31-6Total	2-2	38-8	43-6	41-3	42-8This additional expenditure is unavoidable, givenexisting national policies particularly the uncon-trolled nature of the new housebuilding programme55
-and current economic assumptions. To offset itwould require the virtually complete cessation from1977-78 onwards of expenditure on improvement grants, improvement investment, municipalisationand mortgage lending, which total:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81441	43 0	42*0	42-038. The Welsh Office do not consider these, or indeed any other, reductions in the Welsh housing programme acceptable, in their view, the under-estimate of the rate of new housebuilding in Wales,together with the consequential restrictions, hasalready resulted in a harsher treatment for the welsh housing programme than can be justified by reference either to need or to expenditure levelselsewhere. They consider that some increases wouldbe justified to bring the Welsh housing programmeinto better balance with the English. They expecttheir Secretary of State to propose, duringMinisterial discussion of the Report, the following additional expenditure beyond that shown in para-graph 37 above.  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Subsidies	1-0	2-3	3-8	5-4Improvement grants	0 1	1-8	19	1-9Improvement and other				investment    (including				net lending)	38-4	36-9	39-2	37-5	39-5	410	44-9	44-8There is obviously no possibility of offsetting suchtotal additional expenditure within the Welsh housing programme. Any offsetting savings would have tobe sought in other programmes for which theSecretary of State for Wales has responsibility.POLICY OPTIONSENGLAND39. The Survey ground rules require illustrativeoptions to be shown giving the following additional savings in the English programme.  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-8191-5	181-5	183-9	183-9There are a number of ways in which savings ofthese amounts could be made.  The following aretechnical possibilities, though no judgment is madeas to their political feasibility. For 1977-78 theexpenditure on new housebuilding is to a largeextent already in the pipeline and substantial savings could only be achieved if the rate of approval wasto slow down dramatically (or be curtailed by government action) before the Autumn. It would therefore probably be necessary to achieve most ofthe savings by a further extension of the measureslisted in paragraph 31 above. For 1978-79 and later years, however, reductions in housebuildingcould make substantial contributions to the requiredsavings. For these later years therefore DOE*s listof possible measures is as follows:(i) Controls could be introduced for localauthority new housebuilding to achieve areduction in the annual rate of tenderapprovals. A report on the feasibility ofsuch controls is being prepared for ministers in the context of discussion on the Con-contingency Reserve for 1976-77. If controlswere introduced so as to cut the annual rateof approvals from 1977 onwards to 95,000(or if such a reduction occurred naturally)there would be expenditure savings of about 15 million in 1977-78,  50 million in1978-79 and  55 million in later years.(ii) New Town approvals could be reduced.In most New Towns the demand for houseshas recently eased with the decrease in therate of new job creation, and the rate ofapprovals declines over the Survey period.As New Town industries are among those that may be expected to expand as the economy picks up, failure to allow now forsufficient houses to accommodate the neces-sary labour force could hamper economic recovery. If this risk is accepted howeverfurther savings of  10 million annually on house-building could be made by the latteryears of the quinquennium. Consequentialsavings on other New Town programmes would however be small.(iii) Savings on Housing Association expenditure would have to come from the housing corporation supported part of the pro-gramme. A cut of 5 per cent in the value ofapprovals in 1977-78 and subsequent years would produce savings of  10 million in1978-79 rising to  15 million in 1980-81.
(iv) Legislation on subsidies to achieve a rentin 1978-79 of 30 pence more than thatassumed in the baseline would result ina net saving (after allowing for additionalrent rebates) of  50 million in that and sub-sequent years.(v) Reduced entitlement to rent rebates and allowances could be carried through the survey period to produce additional savings of, say  10 million a year from 1978-79onwards.(vi) A 25 per cent increase in sales over thatassumed in the baseline, i.e. an annual totalof 25,000 instead of 20,000, might beachieved. This would save about  25 million in 1978-79 and later years.(vii) Cuts in municipalisation, mortgage lending,improvement grants and improvement invest-ment are all technically feasible though at a cost to plans for rehabilitating the older partsof the national housing stock. A 5 per centcut on the baseline total of these programmesyields  45 million although if all the abovesavings could be secured a lower cut than this would suffice.40. The Treasury view is that (iv) is unlikely to prove feasible for the reasons set out in paragraph 6;and that (vi) would also be extremely difficult to achieve in view of the amount of effort that wouldbe required with local authorities and building societies if the extra sales were not to be matched by additional local authority lending. In 1977-78a further  45 million therefore would need to befound from (vii), though in later years some of the shortfall could be made good from (i) as well.Summary of Options, England  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Limits on local authority new				housebuilding .	15	50	55	55Reduction in New Towns				programme	2	5	10	10Reduction in Housing Asso-				ciation Schemes	5	10	15	15Additional rent increases of				15p in 1977-78 and 1978-79	25	50	50	50SECRETSummary of Options, England continued  million1977 1978 1979 1980-78        -79        -80      -81Reduced entitlement to rent rebates .... - 10 10 1025% increase in sales 20        25        25        25Cut in municipali sat ion/ im-provemenis/lending to make up balance     ...    25        3S        20        2092       185       185       185scotland41.

Reductions of1,500 in approvals in 1976, 2,500 in each of 1977and 1978, and 2,000 in 1979 and 1980, would givesavings in investment expenditure, together with consequential savings in subsidies as follows:Summary of Options, Scotland  million1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-81Reductions in newhousebuildingapprovals     16-5        28-7        32-5        31-6wales42. Options for Wales need to illustrate savings of  3-9 million in 1977-78,  7-4 million in 1978-79and  7-6 million thereafter.43. The Welsh Office have made the following suggestions: -(i) Slum Clearance. By continuing the emphasis on rehabilitation as an alternative to slum clearance, savings of  0-3 million could bemade in the first two survey years and 0-4 million thereafter.(ii) Improvement Grants, Local Authority Lend-ing   and   Local   A uthority   Improvement57
Investment. Reductions could be made inthese three provisions. On a basis of com-parative need, the private sector provisions should be protected as far as possible. Butthe public sector provision is small and couldbe politically sensitive. The major re-reductions are therefore put to the private sector, as shown in the table below.(iii) Housing Corporation. Some savings couldbe made in later years by slowing downapprovals for Housing Corporation housing association schemes.Summary of Options, Wales  million	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Improvement				investment	0-4	1-6	0-3	 Improvement				grants	1-5	2-7	1-5	0-2Local    authority				mortgage lending	1-7	2-8	1-6	0-2Slum clearance   .	0-3	0-3	0-4	0-4Cuts in housing				association				approvals	-	-	3-8	6-8Total	3-9	7-4	7-6	7-6

The bulk of capital expenditure on the services provided by the Water Authorities in England andWales and regional and island councils in scotland is devoted to water supply and the disposal ofsewage to match domestic and industrial require-ments. In determining the direction of their capital investment programmes since their establishmentia April 1974 the Water Authorities have beenasked by the Department of the Environment andthe Welsh Office to give priority to the avoidance of public health risks and the provision of services for new housing and industry.3. The Welsh National Water development authority (WNWDA) have decided to restrict ex-penditure to meet only basic priority needs thusachieving savings of  11-4 million in 1977-78, 6-4 million in 1978-79 and  7-2 million in1979-80 on the Cmnd. 6393 figures. This results in a programme with an upward trend which willenable the Authority to meet increasing demands from the Welsh housing programme, to meetindustrial requirements and to remedy supply de-ficiencies in certain areas. In Scotland the provision is well below the 1975-76 level and continues toshow a falling profile.Implications of Survey figures2. The figures for capital expenditure from1976-77 onwards are expected to enable theGovernments priorities for the provision of waterservices to be generally realised in England andWales. The programme will however severelyrestrict the Water Authorities&apos; ability to commissionnew works on, for example, improving rivers by bringing some sewage treatment up to standard andthe renewal and replacement of obsolete anddecaying sewers.Additional bid4. For over two years now the Scottish office has been giving consent only to water and sewerageprojects essential for the servicing of new housing and industry or on public health grounds. A back-log of demand has developed and once desirableprojects are becoming essential. There is a parri-cular need to develop major new sources of supply in the East and the North-East which have sufferedshortages in recent years. The following additionalSECRET61
bid is required to ensure that from 1977-78 onwardsprovision is available for these essential projects:  million1976 1977 1978 1979 1980-77    -78    -79    -80    -81Water services in Scotland      -    2 1    4-5    6 0    6 0The scope for offsetting savings is considered inparagraph 21 in relation to all of the Scottishadditional bids in the Other environmental servicesProgramme.Policy options5. For England and Wales the illustrative optionswould be:  million7977 ;978 1979 1980-78     -79     -80     -81Water Authorities England 13-2    26-6    26-7    26-7WNWDA    ....       1-2      2-6      2-7      2-7While it is expected that the provision in Table 8will enable the Governmenfs priorities to beachieved, it is possible that in England and wales the programme will produce accumulating difficul-ties in particular areas in serving housing andindustry; that it will lead to further deterioration insome rivers; and that it will allow insufficient scope for the substantial programme of renewal and replacement of outworn assets which the water authorities are beginning to identify as necessary.These difficulties will be exacerbated if increased expenditure becomes necessary as a result of imple-mentation of the main water provisions of theControl of Pollution Act 1974. Therefore, any reduction in the programme could make it im-practicable to meet the Governmenfs priorities in housing, industry and the prevention of seriouspublic health risks.6. The Scottish Office do not consider it possibleto offer a realistic option on the water programme and the possibilities of options on the Scottishprovision in Programme 8 as a whole are discussed in paragraph 28 below.Land drainage: England and WalesImplications of Survey figures7.  The Survey figures will not be sufficient to meetpresent contractual commitments for the ThamesTidal Flood Protection Scheme and to completethese works by the scheduled date.Additional bids8. The following additional bid arises partly because of slippage in the programme in 1975-76and partly because earlier estimates have been revised in the light of tender prices for contractswhich have since been let:  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Thames tidal scheme	12-6	24-9	33-7	8-4	-23-3The works consist of construction of the barrieritself and improvement of the defences downstream.To reduce expenditure below the level now forecastit would be necessary to defer the letting of contractson the 60 per cent of the downstream defences onwhich work has not yet been started. The work would have to be delayed for at least two yearsbeyond the scheduled completion date of spring1980. Delay would expose downstream areas to the risks of flooding from a surge tide for two more years. During that period, raising the completedbarrier in order to protect London from a surgetide would seriously aggravate downstream floodingbecause of the reflected wave effect. During the1975 Survey Ministers agreed that delaying thedownstream works would create unacceptable risks.9. The additional expenditure needed for the thames scheme is so large in relation to expenditureon other arterial drainage that offsetting savings could be achieved only by the virtual abandonment of other land drainage and flood protection work inthe rest of England and Wales for 1977-78 and1978-79 and by substantial reductions in 1976-77and 1979-80.Policy options10. Reductions required to achieve savings of2J per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent in later years would be:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Thames tidal scheme	-20	-2-2	-14	-1-other arterial drainage: .				Capital  .	-0-9	-1-8	-1-8	-1-8Current .	-0-9	-1-6	-16	-1-611. There are no possibilities of reductions in expenditure on the Thames scheme withoutdelaying the completion of downstream defence
works. The savings on capital expenditure on otherarterial drainage would mean delaying the provisionof land drainage and flood protection work carriedout by Regional Water Authorities. The workdelayed would be likely to include the provision offlood protection for existing urban development andfor new housing sites as well as work to improve the drainage of agricultural land. (However, invest-ment in arterial drainage forms only a very small part of the total capital expenditure of water authorities.) The savings on current expenditure would affect maintenance work involving a conse-quent risk of flooding in some areas.Local environmental services12. These services include refuse collection and dis-posal, the provision of parks and recreational facilities, the provision of municipal offices andadministrative services, activities under the Townand Country Planning Acts and a miscellany ofother services. The forecast of local authoritycurrent expenditure is subject to consultation withthe Consultative Council on Local government finance and the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities in the course of the annual rate support grant negotiations.CAPITAL13. Most of the services in England and Wales fall within the locally determined sector arrangementsfor controlling capital expenditure which allow for a block borrowing approval to local authorities.Within their block allocations they are free to spendat their own discretion together with funds fromrevenue or capital receipts. The sector covers a wide variety of projects including some falling in other programmes and it is not possible to forecast exactlyhow much will be spent on particular services. Pastindications are that capital expenditure by localauthorities on local environmental services haveexceeded forecasts, but this has been balanced byunderspend on other services. In Scotland localauthority capital expenditure is subject to specificapproval.Implications of Survey figures14.  The provision remains at the reduced level asin Cmnd. 6393. The effect of this is likely to be a continuing change in the pattern of expenditure inSECRETthe locally determined sector away from sport and recreational services which are costly in terms of subsequent current expenditure towards a greaterconcentration on and the replacement of existing facilities for refuse collection and disposal. the stimulus to derelict land reclamation provided bythe introduction of 100 per cent grants in assisted andderelict land clearance areas in England, which took effect in December 1975, has resulted in increasedactivity in those areas. This is in line with the planned increase in the rate of reclamation inScotland and Wales for which the new DevelopmentAgencies are now responsible.Additional bid15. The Scottish Office have made an additionalbid as follows:  million	1976 1977 -77     -78	1978 -79	1979 -80	1980 -81Town  and  country				planning				Scotland .	3-3     4-5	2-7	2-7	2-7It has emerged that the pre-reorganisation localauthorities had postponed the settlement of largestatutory commitments which are now expected tomature over a relatively short period. As a conse-quence of this the Scottish Office were misled intoforecasting in Cmnd. 6393 a level of expenditurewell below the recent historic level and lower thannow appears necessary if the impetus on urbanrenewal is to be maintained at a reasonable rate.Offsetting savings are discussed in paragraph 21.CURRENT ENGLAND AND WALESImplications of Survey figures16. For 1977-78 there is a reduction of 3-5 percent below the expenditure accepted for the rate support grant settlement for 1976-77, which itselfrepresented an overall reduction in these services ofsome 6 per cent below the then estimated outturn for1975-76. The difficulties of keeping expenditure tothese reduced levels are made more acute byadditional costs arising from demographic factors in some areas and the revenue consequences ofrecent capital projects. The settlement for 1976-77assumed that charges would be made for all services for which local authorities have power to charge.63
and that the level of charges would be sufficient tocover costs wherever this was feasible. There is little scope for additional savings in real terms from increased charges in 1977-78 or subsequent years.17. The level of expenditure accepted for 1976-77implied that there would be an all-round reductionin the standard of services provided; reduced openinghours, or even closure, of some existing leisure and recreation facilities and a deferment of the openingof new ones; and a reduction in the numbers of staff engaged on central administration and on the en-forcement of certain provisions in the area of publichealth. The reductions in expenditure for 1977-78and subsequent years assumed in Cmnd. 6393 willrequire a further reduction in standards on theservices in this group including those for refusecollection and the enforcement of public health pro-visions. These services are manpower intensive andthe reductions could only be achieved through com-pulsory redundancies.Additional bid18. The scope for reductions is limited by theneed to maintain basic health standards and to take account of the revenue consequences of past capitalexpenditure, particularly on town and country planning. A lowering of standards on some of these services has been avoided in the past by imposingadditional reductions on other services in the Otherenvironmental services Programme. But the rate ofdecline on those other services is now so great thatit is unrealistic to look to them for further savings.Increasing expenditure on refuse, environmentalhealth and town and country planning cannot therefore be accommodated within the Survey figuresfor 1978-79 onwards. An additional  30 million ayear will be required for those years:  million1976 1977 1978 1979 1980-77     -78     -79     -80     -81Local environmentalservicesEngland andWales current expenditure -      -     30 0   30 0   30 019. Additional expenditure of this order, though not sought by the Department of the Environment,may in fact be unavoidable because expenditure bylocal authorities is not under the direct control ofMinisters.   The Department of the Environmenthave not identified offsetting savings but in the viewof the Treasury priority must be given to findingsavings to offset such unavoidable additions beforeconsideration can be given to other additional bidsor to policy options for any other purpose. TheTreasury consider that the necessary savings mightbe found within the Other environmental servicesProgramme, in particular from capital expenditureon local environmental services and on new towns.The consequence of these reductions would be as described in paragraph 25.CURRENT SCOTLANDAdditional bid20. Similar considerations apply in Scotland. Theposition there is, however, more serious because inthe 1975 RSG settlement this programme was usedto some extent as a regulator. The Scottish office has made the following additional bid. It assumes that the local authorities&apos; own budget estimates arethe best indicator available at present of their probable spending in 1976-77; and that it is un-realistic to expect them to reduce their net expendi-ture in the following years. The following figurescover local authority current expenditure on waterservices as well as local environmental services.  million1976 1977 1978 1979 1980-77     ^78     -79     -80     -81Local environmentalservicesScotland currentexpenditure_--     32-6    34-7    34-4    34-421.

savings.  Applying the policy option percentages tothe base	figures would	produce	the followingsavings:						  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-816-6	13-0	12-6	12-6The consequences would be severe, because within these services it is impracticable to make significantreductions in refuse collection or town and country planning, and this leaves a very narrow base. Itwould be possible to make substantial reductions in local authority factory building. The full acnieve-ment of the savings would remove all scope for new projects in some parts of the programme for up to two years and in the services susceptible to cuts would reduce activity thereafter by over one quarter.This would inevitably hit provision, e.g. for sport,which is a vital element in the attack on urbandeprivation.22. In order to accommodate the additional bidsit would be necessary to ask the Scottish Office tofind the remainder of the savings, amounting to:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-813-5	33-0	29-8	31-2	31-2from within that part of other main programmes which falls within the responsibility of theii Secre-tary of State.23. In the view of the Treasury, priority wouldhave to be given to offsetting the unavoidableadditions to current expenditure. However, evenif the savings on capital expenditure in Programme 8were all applied for this purpose, further savings of 26 million in 1977-78 and nearly  22 million a yearthereafter would have to be found from other main programmes before consideration could be given toother additional bids or to policy options for anyother purpose.CAPITAL AND CURRENT GREAT BRITAINPolicy options24. Paragraphs 16-21 about local authority current expenditure refer to the implications of the Surveyfigures. The services covered by this group are inthe main of purely local interest and are subject toSECRETconsiderable local pressures. The standards of ser-vice provided are very much within the discretion oflocal authorities, who on refuse and environmentalhealth, for instance, must bear in mind the risk to public health if standards are allowed to fall too low. The implications of reducing standards on theother services do not include a health hazard, butthey are almost as compelling. In these circum-stances it would be totally unrealistic to make further reductions, even for illustrative purposes, tothe Cmnd. 6393 current expenditure figures, and nosuch reductions have been made. The cuts would therefore have to be made in capital expenditure onthe local environmental services.Local environment services: capital25. Considerable cuts have already been made inplanned expenditure for these services in order toarrive at the Cmnd. 6393 figures. It would bedifficult to go back on the earlier decision to increasethe provision for derelict land reclamation and thereis little scope for reducing the level of expenditureon coast protection after the winter flooding. Iftherefore cuts had to be made here to offset theunavoidable addition of  30 million a year from1978-79 on current expenditure, referred to in para-graph 18 above, the burden would fall heavily on thelocally determined sector. The local authorities would find it difficult to provide the necessaryessential support facilities for the housing programme and there would need to be an even tighterreassessment of priorities for administrative and recreation services. It must be doubted whether anyfurther cuts are a realistic option. However, theillustrative option figures for England are:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Local environmental services				capital: England	28-0	550	54-0	54026. In addition the following cuts would need to bemade to the provision for capital expenditure on industrial and commercial development in the new towns in England:  million1977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	-80	-81New towns			England-commercial and			industrial development.    1 -0	1-9	1-9	1-965
In the opinion of DOE these cuts should only bemade if the option cuts on the new towns housing programme are implemented.27. In Wales the burden of the cuts would fallheavily on the locally determined sector, as inEngland.  million1977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	-80	-81Local environmental services			capital: Wales      .           1-8	3-2	3-2	3-228. In Scotland too it is not considered realistic tosuggest options on local authority current expenditurenor on other current and capital expenditure withinProgramme 8 except in the case of capital expend-iture on local environmental services and industrial and commercial development in the new towns.Consequently Scottish Office options, if not alreadypre-empted as savings to offset additional bids,would fall upon the capital expenditure for this group of services. The amounts involved would be:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Local environmental services				and New Towns, Scotland				capital ....	6-6	13-0	12-6	12-6The consequences of cuts of this order have been described in paragraph 21.Community ownership of development land29. This expenditure provides for the capitalisedpurchase, administrative and interest costs of localauthorities and the Land Authority for Wales of buying and making available land for privatedevelopment in their areas. This new scheme isbeing controlled initially by separate borrowingapprovals and will subsequently be controlled on thebasis of annual allocations of borrowing approval.Implications of Survey figures30. It is estimated that the figures in Table 8, whichare shown on a net basis, will permit the followingacquisitions and disposals of land in Great Britain:Acres1976     1977     1978     1979     1980_-77      -78      -79      -80      -81Acquisitions . 1,400 3,700 7,000 11,400 15,200Disposals -        400    2,300    5,300    8,500These acreages are less than the amounts shown in cmnd. 6393, which reflected the rate of developmentland tax then expected. The decision to reduce therate of this tax to stimulate the private land marketwill increase the cost of local authority landpurchases and therefore reduce the level of trans-actions under the scheme.Additional bids31. In order to maintain the acreage figures quoted in Cmnd. 6393, despite the change in developmentland tax, the following additional sums arerequired:  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81England	.    1-5	3-5	7-0	5-5	5- scotland	0-2	0-4	0-9	0-7	0 if offsetting savings had to be found to accommodatethis additional expenditure in England, the Depart-ment of Environment would look to capitalexpenditure by the local authorities. The conse-quence of such reductions in combination with thepolicy options, would be to increase the severity ofthe effects described in paragraph 25. The questionof offsetting savings in Scotland is discussed inparagraph 21.Policy options32.  The illustrative options are:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81England   .	1-2	4*0	4*0	4-wales	0 1	0-4	0 4	0-4In this area the cuts would affect the rate of build upof the land scheme and slow down the bringing forward of land for development.The Scottish Office consider that any reduction risksdestroying the credibility of the scheme, and haveshown alternative options on local environmental services capital expenditure.Royal Palaces and Royal ParksImplications of Survey figures33.  The provision reflects the same level of work as in 1976-77.
Policy options34.  The illustrative reductions would be as follows:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Reductions in the mainten-				ance, etc., of Royal Palaces				and Royal Parks	0-3	0-5	0-5	0-5The present programme scarcely covers essentialmaintenance on Royal Palaces and Royal Parks;as the palaces cannot be allowed to fall intodisrepair and cuts in maintenance would affect thequality of the parks, reductions must fall on capitalexpenditure on new works. This would mean areduction of one third on major new works forRoyal Palaces and two thirds for Royal Parks; the limited amount of new starts planned in the periodmeans that, to achieve the full cuts, reductions wouldhave to be made in the provision for urgent minorworks, leaving insufficient funds for this purpose.Deferment, instead, of all new starts on major worksfrom 1977-78 to 1980-81 would produce savings of:  million7977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	-80	-81Deferment of all new starts.     0-1	0-2	0 3	0-3This lower cut, although difficult for the Department,would be more practical and realistic.Historic bnildings and ancient monumentsImplications of Survey figures35. Expenditure on this item maintains broadly thesame level of work as in 1976-77 in grants for the repair of historic buildings, other related services andthe purchase, maintenance, repair and display ofancient monuments before sites are developed. no specific provision has been made for the introduction in England and Wales of repair grants for historicchurches in use.Policy options36.  Reductions in England of 1\ per cent in1977-78 and 5 per cent in the	later	years	would produce the following savings:					 	million7977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	-80	-81Historic buildings and ancient			monuments: England      .   0-5	10	10	1-0SECRETThe expenditure currently available for the pro-tection and preservation of the archaeological andarchitectural heritage is already insufficient to meetgrowing demands and any reduction in the level of funds would result in the loss of some important part of this heritage which could otherwise havebeen saved. For this reason any reduction ofexpenditure would have to be concentrated on the plans for the provision of car parks, toilets andother facilities for visitors and administration costs.It is not possible to regulate the number of visitors to ancient monuments; and if reasonable facilities are not provided for visitors, public safety andhygiene are likely to be at risk, and there would beresistance to increased charges.37. The bulk of expenditure on historic buildingsis in the form of grants to owners of historicbuildings. The demand for grant continues toincrease and any reduction would seriously impair the work of preservation of historic buildings.Control on expenditure is exercised by way of a commitment ration which allows neither an increasein volume nor revaluation of cash grants committed,although this ration will be revalued annually from1976.Environmental researchImplications of Survey figures38. The provision for this item which covers theDepartment of the Environments three researchstations (Transport and Road Research Laboratory,Building Research Establishment and the Hydrau-lics Research Station), the extra-mural research programme and grants to research associations andother bodies, reflects a substantial reduction in theDepartmenfs research programme in the years1976-77 to 1980-81.Policy options39.  The illustrative reductions would be as follows:  million			1977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	SO	-81Reduction in research effort.    0-9	1-6	1-8	1-8This programme suffered a cut of about onethird of the original provision in the 1975 survey and in addition is likely to be further reduced bythe reduction in Civil Service staff costs.   The67
illustrative reduction in 1978-79 would mean afurther 10 per cent cut in the extra mural pro-grammes which comprise mainly long term com-commitments with public sector agencies such as BritishRail. Warren Spring Laboratory, Natural Environ-ment Research Council and the United kingdom atomic Energy Research Establishment which havealready met reductions and would cause severedisruption. There would be little or no capacity to respond to the growing demand for research on transport policy, local government finance and housing finance. Research programmes which havebeen formulated from policy reviews in these areascould not be supported. Nevertheless despite thesequalifications, the cuts are regarded as realistic andfeasible.Central and miscellaneous environmental services40. This covers the costs of the CountrysideCommissions, the Nature Conservancy Council andthe Sports Councils, together with a number ofother small items.Implications of Survey figures41.  These bodies already operate on tightly drawnbudgets and the figures permit no growth overalland only small increases in real terms in SportsCouncil expenditure up to 1978-79.Policy options42.  The following reductions would arise:  million	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81England   .	0-5	1-0	1-0	10Wales	-	0-1	0-1	01The illustrative option for Scotland has been included in the option on local environmental services capital expenditure.43. The burden of the illustrative cuts in Englandand Wales would fall on the Sports Councils, whichabsorb over half this expenditure, particularly ontheir capital expenditure (grants to local authorities,National Centres and other major national projects)although the cuts would also result in a lowerstandard of maintenance of existing NationalCentres. In the longer term, the Sports Councilsmay have to reduce staff and administrative costs.The Nature Conservancy Council, which is a verylabour-intensive organisation, would also beaffected. The illustrative reductions would have to fall mainly on the care of existing nature reservesincluding maintenance urork on which there isalready a heavy backlog due to earlier financialstringencies. The effects would be serious andcumulative over the years. The impact of cuts onthe small budgets of the Countryside Commissionand the grant-aided bodies would be very hard to absorb.

This programme is dominated by local authoritycurrent expenditure which, under present arrange-ments, is not under direct Government control. the biggest single element is police manpower, to which ministers attach particular priority. The centralGovernment elements in the programme are largelydemand-determined, and&quot; the demand is increasing.In order to protect priority services, viz. police.  million at 1976 Survey prices
prison staff, and the probation and fire services,capital expenditure was subject to a disproportion-ately heavy cut in last year&apos;s Survey.2. Against this background the Home Office havenot been able to identify sufficient realistic savings to offset the additional bids. Nor is there any way in which illustrative reductions under the Surveyground rules could be achieved except by reducingessential protective services and/or by cutting outsocially desirable expenditure, e.g. community services. In particular, the Home Office see littlescope for further cuts in capital expenditure, andoffer no significant policy options in this area. TheTreasury consider that the capital programmes should not be regarded as necessarily exempt from further cuts. Effective measures to control the localauthority elements of expenditure would involvepolitically contentious legislation, to which theHome Office are firmly opposed.Administration of justiceMagistrates&apos; Courts3. Current expenditure was cut during the 1975Survey because it was assumed that changes couldbe made in the law which would reduce the work-load. There is now no prospect of this and the survey base figures are inadequate to cope withthe expected demand.4. On the capital side, the Survey base figures will cover the completion of court houses already under construction and a small programme of new works in 1976-77. There will be no new work in later years.Higher Courts5. Current expenditure depends on the number ofcases coming forward. For civil business costs are largely offset by fees. For criminal business the survey base figures are inadequate to cope with present estimates of demand. Capital expenditure is being rephased and will be concentrated in the later years of the Survey period. Two major pro-jects will have to be deferred and one projectomitted.Additional bids6.

Expenditure on civil and criminal legal aiddepends upon the number of applicants. The surveybase figures are inadequate to cope with present estimates of demand. The Lord Chancellor proposesto contain expenditure on civil legal aid by with-drawing it from undefended divorce cases. This willbe controversial and will necessitate using part ofthe resources thereby released for the extension of legal services in other directions. The net savingswill not meet the increase in demand.71

At present there are 41,600 people in prison,about 1,400 more than assumed in Cmnd. 6393.Most current expenditure is on wages of prisonstaff. Revised forecasts since Cmnd. 6393 show a shortfall  in expected receipts from prison industries.The Survey base figures do not provide for the costof about 150 prison officers formerly on detachedduty in Northern Ireland, who are no longer required there, but are needed in their establish-ments in England and Wales to deal with theincrease in the prison population and reduce over-time. Unless extra provision is made to deal withthese developments, manpower will have to bereduced. Prisoners would then have to spend mostof their time in their cells; both control and securitywould be put at risk: and there would be furtherlosses of earnings from prison industries. If main-tenance of buildings had to be reduced, the fabricin some establishments might become unusable.Capitol expenditure18. Building schemes already started will be com-pleted. providing about 5,000 new prison places overthe Survey period. A start will be made on a newprison at Low Newton which in the view of theHome Office is essential to deal with difficult and dangerous prisoners.

probation and after-care21. Cmnd. 6393 assumed that the number of pro-nation  officers would rise from 4,818 to 5,340 by theend of 1979-80; but the allowance made for trainingcosts is now found to be inadequate and it will notbe possible to provide fully for this planned increase.The Survey figures do not allow for the expectedgrowth of work (and hence staff requirements)between 1979-80 and 1980-81. However, the survey figures provide for the extension of com-munity service schemes, the expansion of the daytraining centre scheme, and for 900 places in adultprobation and bail hostels in addition to the present540.Additional bid22. The following bid is to cover training costs and to provide for expected growth between 1979-80and 1980-81.  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81-0-2	0-5	0-3	0-5Policy options23. The following savings would entail an initialreduction in manpower and limitations on laterexpansion, which would involve lowering standards of supervision.

It was assumed in Cmnd. 6393 that the numberof police officers would rise from 107,000 on31 March 1976 to 112,250 on 31 March 1980.Authorised establishment on 31 March 1976 was117,000. Continued improvement in recruiting andsome essential increases in establishments have ledto a revision of the former figures to 107,900 and115,000 respectively. These increases are taken intoaccount in the Survey base figures, except for somerelated expenditure on training and equipment. TheHome Office assume that Ministers will continueto take the same view of the priority attached to police recruitment as they have in the past andwhich was reflected in Cmnd. 6393 in the statement that, if numbers should exceed the estimated growth,SECRETprovision will be made for additional expenditure within authorised establishments. The Treasurysuggest that in the present economic situation these arrangements should be reviewed.25. The Survey figures assume a sharp reductionin the number of civilians including traffic wardensand cadets, from 45,890 on 31 March 1976 to44,200 on 31 March 1977. The figures then assumed gradual increase to 45,850 on 31 March 1980, andthe same number in 1981.26. On the capital side the Survey figures allow for a small programme of operational buildings in1976-77 and a start on the new Merseyside PoliceHeadquarters in 1977-78. Provision is also madefor two enlarged forensic laboratories to replace fourexisting ones, for some redevelopment of the policetraining centres, and for completing the expansionof the Police College. By the end of the survey period the scale and standard of many buildings willbe far short of the requirements of the service. the survey figures are inadequate to meet the expectedrequirement for police vehicles this expenditure isnot under Government control.Additional bids27.

Policy options28. Significant savings could be achieved only by reducing the number of police cadets and restrictingrecruitment to the regular force. Reducing thenumber of cadets will adversely affect recruitment to the regular force when the employment marketbecomes more competitive. Restricting recruit-ment to the regular force could be achieved by allowing wastage to reduce to (say) 95 per cent of establishment those forces whose strength is nowabove this. However, as the London and somemetropolitan county forces are already so deficientin manpower, they would still have room to recruitwithin the reduced establishments. There wouldhave to be detailed control from the centre. Therewould be severe objections on grounds of loss ofpolice effectiveness, loss of local autonomy and fromthose forces who were up to establishment, whowould be asked to make sacrifices for forces whowere not.29. Further savings of about  12-1 million a year from 1978-79 could come from reducing the numberof traffic wardens and support staff. This wouldmean less enforcement of parking regulations andcontrol of traffic and pedestrians and more conges-tion and delay in city centres, especially London.30. Further economies could be sought in the useof police vehicles.31. If legislation were to be avoided, all these measures would require the co-operation of chief constables and police authorities, which could not be counted upon unless the state of the economy were seen to require draconian measures in every areaof public expenditure. If (as the Home Office thinkmore likely) co-operation was not forthcoming, the savings could be secured only by legislation whichwould impose a greater degree of central directionon the police service and alter the balance of controlbetween Government and police authorities. Thepolitical problems of measures, and still more oflegislation, to reduce police strength and damagerecruitment, at a time of rising crime and additions to the burdens of the police, are self-evident.32. Smaller savings might be secured throughinternal reorganisation and amalgamations; and bydeferring the formation of the Police ComplaintsBoard: but this would mean amending the Police(Complaints) Bill now before Parliament. these and the other measures above would produce thefollowing savings:  million					1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Manpower:				Police.	2-0	5-2	7-9	9-3Cadets	1-0	3-0	5-0	6-0Traffic wardens .	-	12-5	12-5	12-vehicles   ....	 	10	10	10Reorganisation .	 	0-4	0-4	0-4Police Complaints Board  .	0-2	0-2	0-2	0-2Total	3-2	22-3	27-0	29-4fire services33. The Survey base figures reflect the assumptionthat the numbers of whole-time firemen, of part-time and junior firemen, and of civilian staff, willremain constant at about 32,400. 14,000 and 5,300.respectively. To limit numbers to these levelsdepends upon the co-operation of local authorities.On 31 December 1975 the actual number of whole-time firemen in post was 32,550, i.e. 150 abovethe limit provided for in the Survey figures. In1977-78 and succeeding years there will be reduc-tions in expenditure on fire research and on the fire service staff and technical colleges.34. The figures for capital expenditure assume avery limited and sharply declining building pro-gramme. This will mean the continuance in serviceof out-of-date stations and will make it difficult toreplace worn-out fire appliances, with consequentrisk of serious loss of operational efficiency.Additional bids35.

No option is offered in respect of manpower.To achieve the savings below, reductions would be needed in capital expenditure on new fire stations,fire service housing, appliances and vehicles. Theco-operation of local authorities would be required.Coming on top of earlier reductions, cuts of this order would involve continuing to use out-of-datefire stations and appliances, which would seriouslyimpair operational efficiency.

Most of this expenditure is concerned withthe administration of the naturalisation service andcontrols on immigration, but the programme alsocovers the immigration appeal system and a grant-in-aid to the United Kingdom Immigrants advisory service. The Survey figures are inadequate tomaintain these latter services.Additional bid40. The immigration appeal system is statutory.Provision was cut in the 1975 Survey but there isno falling off in demand.

Nor are the figures sufficient to maintainemergency and strategic reserves of food at levelspreviously approved by Ministers as the minimum necessary to mitigate the effects of a serious civil or defence emergency.Additional bids43.

Offsetting savings could onlybe provided by a policy decision to reduce stocksbelow the approved levels, which would itself implyabandoning or restricting the rebuilding of the sugarstocks.Policy options44. A review by officials has recommended thatsome oil storage sites and stocks be disposed of.The major part of the pipeline network is no longerneeded for civil emergency purposes and a possiblereduction is under consideration. BNOC might ultimately take over the system.

Community Services45. Cmnd. 6393 made provision for the continua-tion of existing urban programme projects, grants to voluntary bodies and the new Equal opportunities -ties Commission (EOQ, and for replacing the separate Race Relations Board and community relations Commission by a new Race relations commission (RRC). The Survey figures will allow the RRC and the EOC to continue at the plannedlevel of activity. As regards the urban programmethere is very little scope for new capital projectsafter 1977-78 unless savings are created by notcontinuing existing projects beyond their initial period.Additional bids46. An interdepartmental group has reportedseparately on the problems of inner city areas. if in the light of their report Ministers decide to restore the capacity of the urban programme tofund new projects on the previous scale the amountsinvolved are set out below. The report says thatany addition to this programme must be containedwithin the overall public expenditure limits, thoughit does not say how this should be done:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-810-7	5-8	8-1	8-447. To extend beyond 1976-77 the period of grantaid for special projects for ethnic minorities (whichis part of the urban programme) would involve:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-811-5	1-5	1-5	1-5Policy options48. The following saving would be required:(i) Community relations  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-815-6	6-4	6-8	6-8This would require legislation to abolish the EqualOpportunities Commission, the Community Rela-tions Commission, and the Race Relations Boardand postpone establishment of Race relations commission.  Politically it would involve a majorreversal of policy; it would weaken greatly theposition of women and ethnic minorities; it wouldbe claimed that it marked an end of Governmentconcern about race relations. About 350 staff would be redundant. If the Home Office were totake responsibility for making grants to local organi-sations the community relations field work could continue. The savings would be reduced by 1 million a year.(ii) CDP and other urban deprivation:   research and development  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-810-7	0-5	0-5	0-5To secure these savings would entail the prematurecessation of Community Development Projects(CDP), and the stopping of development of com-prehensive community programmes.(iii) Urban programme projects  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-815-1	2-9	2-8	2-8These savings could be secured by not issuing newapprovals for projects under the urban programme;existing grants would be renewed.RHODESIA49. No provision was made in Cmnd. 6393 fordealing with a possible influx of refugees from rhodesia.Additional bid50. An influx of refugees would affect several departments. About  40 million of additional expenditure would fall to the Home Office. Thetotal might be  65- 140 million in 1977-78.Central and miscellaneous servicesAdditional bid51. Contingent provision of  1-5 million in1980-81 is required for Home Office dispersal.Policy option52.

The Survey base figures include no provisionfor the Divorce Reform (Scotland) Bill at presentbefore Parliament. The figures are insufficient toenable construction both of Glasgow Sheriff court and phase I of Shotts prison (see below) to proceed as planned, but otherwise the most essentialbuildings can be constructed, and extensions andrenovations of some existing buildings undertaken.Additional bids54. If the Divorce Bill is passed this will result inadditional expenditure which by 1980-81 will amount to  0-2 million.55. In the years 1977-78 and 1978-79 the basefigures for the courts building programme will beunderspent by  1-6 million; this matches the extramoney which will be needed under the revised esti-mate of costs to complete phase I of the new prisonestablishment at Shotts, a project already com-mitted. The amounts involved should therefore be assigned to prisons from the court allocation forthese two years. The saving on the court head isdue to delay in starting the Glasgow Sheriff court to which very high priority is attached as accommo-dation there is already inadequate. The project willrequire additional expenditure in the later years ofthe programme.

It is estimated that the total number ofprisoners held in custody in Scotland will increase by about 14 per cent over the period, from anaverage of 5,200 in 1976-77 to about 5,950 in1980-81. The Survey figures imply no new startson major buildings and no increase in staff after theend of 1976-77. This would lead to a steadyworsening of custodial standards and accommoda-tion and a slowing down of development of prisonindustries and training. Capital programmes havebeen severely cut and if phase I of Shotts prisonis to be constructed in time funds would have to be diverted from the Courts capital programme (seeparagraph 55 above).Additional bids64.

The figures in 1977-78 and 1978-79 arelow because the implications of the ievel of recruit-ment assumed in the rate support grant settlement for 1976-77 have not been carried forward into thefollowing years. Recruitment had reached almost12,500 by March 1976 and, to stay within the basefigures, it would be necessary to run down projectedpolice strengths by some 300 in 1977-78 and about250 in 1978-79.

The Survey figures provide for the total of full-time firemen to remain constant at about 3900men. The number in post at 31 March 1976 wasabout 3950. Local authorities appear to be main-taining some restraint; but after allowing for a risein the number of pension payments as a result of an increasing number of retirements, the figures imply a reduction of about 100 men over the period. Thecapital programme has already been reduced towhat might be regarded as a dangerously low level.The figures contain no allowance for an increasedneed for fire protection as a consequence of north sea Oil developments.Additional bids70.

In the main it has been possible to providewithin the base figures for the continuation of the policies announced in Cmnd. 6393 for the period to1979-80. But the provision for salary drift for teachers, school transport and compensation forredundant college of education staff is insufficient to maintain existing policy. The base figures for1980-81 do not allow for the continuation of cmnd. 6393 policies for developing post-schooleducation in response to growing demands on theservice, for continuing the expansion of in-service training for teachers, for increasing the numbers of pupils receiving special educational treatment and developing local libraries. The base figures wouldalso require the postponed 5p increase in schoolmeal charges to take effect in April 1977 and tobe followed by a similar increase in September1977.2. Total expenditure, after reaching a peak in1976-77, is expected to decline annually beforerising again in 1980-81 when the costs of providingfor increases in the size of the post-school age groups will begin to outweigh the savings arisingfrom the reducing school population.3. Projections of pupil, student and teachernumbers consistent with the base figures aregiven below. For the period to 1979-80 they are substantially similar to those underlying Cmnd.6393.Thousands	1976	1977	1978	7979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Schools:					Under-fives (including					nursery)	422	422	422	422	422Primary pupils	4,676	4,558	4,410	4,243	4,065Secondary pupils to 16	3,476	3,509	3,509	3,480	3,417Secondary pupils over 16	511	535	555	577	601Special school pupils	128	131	134	136	136Teachers	462	462	461	458	450Non-advanced FE stud-					ents* (excluding Evening					Institutes) .	503	520	537	554	562Evening Institutes	181	185	188	192	194Higher Education   stud-					ents* ....	484	490	500	516	536* These figures are subject to possible revision in the light of decisions about higher -Tees for home and overseas students.Primary and secondary schools4. It is assumed that the schools will continue toeducate all children of statutory school age and thoseremaining at school after the age of 16. The totalschool population will fall by over 500,000 duringthe Survey period, and only the numbers of pupilsover the statutory school leaving age show any significant increase,5. Cmnd. 6393 made provision for raainUuunguntil 1979-80 the average pupil-teacher ratiosachieved in the academic year 1975-76, namely:Under-FivesPrimary   .Secondary to 16Secondary over 1626-6 : 123-6 : 117-9 : 19-5 : 1Those ratios implied, for the first time, a reductionin the size of the teaching force in 1979-80. Aspupil numbers continue to fall a further reduction
of 4,000 would follow in 1980-81, and the teachernumbers consistent with the Cmnd. 6393 policy would thus be :Tiiou sands1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-81463 464 464 460 456If, however, the revised estimate of the costs of teachers&apos; salary increments (see paragraph 30 below)were not met, and the salary bill constrained to the base figures, the size of the teaching force for eachyear would need to be smaller than this, as shownin the table in paragraph 3. The effect would beto increase still further the already substantialsurplus of trained teachers and preclude the intro-duction of induction training. Even if additional resources for incremental drift were found, the basefigure for 1980-81 would require the developmentof in-service training to mark time rather than becontinued as previously planned.6. The 1979-80 starts figures for capital pro-grammes which underlay Cmnd. 6393 are repeatedfor 1980-81.7. The need to maintain the growth in non-teaching unit costs of lli per cent a year to allow for diseconomies of scale as the numbers of pupilsfall and to provide for the effects of bringing intouse new buildings, changes in teaching methods andthe costs of new equipment was recognised in theexpenditure forecasts of the 1975 Survey. A similarallowance for growth in these unit costs is allowed in the base figures for 1980-81 as the rate ofdecline in pupil numbers secondary as well asprimary-accelerates in that year.Under-fives8. The Cmnd. 6393 policy of holding constant thenumber of under-fives in nursery and primary schools at the 1976-77 level-now estimated at422,000-would be continued into 1980-81. Themodest building programme of  3-3 million startsper year from 1978-79 compares with starts to thevalue of  10 million expected in 1976-77, andwould allow the continuance on a limited scale ofa policy of. providing purpose-equipped facilities in place of existing ill-suited accommodation in theareas of greatest need. Existing regulations as tothe minimum standards of provision required fornursery places are being examined to see if somereductions in cost can be achieved.Special schools9. The policies underlying Cmnd. 6393 impliedpostponing the provision of places in special schools for the substantial number of children who are having to be accommodated in ordinary schoolswhere their requirements cannot adequately be met.The expenditure limits allow for no increase in thenumber of special school places beyond 1979-80.School meals10. The DES consider that the decision, as partof the package of measures announced on 5 May1976, to defer the increase (from I5p to 20p) in theschool meal charge planned for September 1976will make it impracticable to achieve the Cmnd.6393 objective of halving by 1980 the rate of subsidywhich obtained in 1975-76 (63 per cent). In their view the most rapid progress towards reducing thesubsidy which would have credibility in relation tothat decision would be to implement the previouslyplanned increases I year in arrears. This would imply a bid for additional public expenditure, asfollows:  million1977-78        1978-19        1979-80       1980-8140 49 42 7The Treasury believes that there are other possibili-ties, including that of sticking to the base figureseither literally or by amalgamating the two increases which they would require in 1977.School milk11. The limits of expenditure will allow for the implementation from 1976-77 of the legislation now before Parliament on the basis previously intendedviz. that local education authorities individuallywill have discretion to set the charge for school milk (except where free provision is a statutoryrequirement) and to remit it in cases of hardship.Higher and further education12. The base figures allow for the age-participationrates prevailing in 1979-80 to be maintained in1980-81. Provision has been made for theadditional student numbers and for staff numbers to be increased in that year to preserve the staff-student ratios expected in 1979-80, namely:Non-advanced FurtherTiducation    .      1:11-9Universilies.....1:9-4Advanced Further Education .      .      1:9-2
As indicated in Cmnd. 6393 academic staff numbers are expected not to increase between 1976-77 and1979-80. These policies, however, depend on additional resources being available to cover thecost of incremental salary drift (see paragraph 30).13. The expenditure forecasts in Cmnd. 6393 for higher education provided for a rate of expansionconsistent with attaining 600,000 full-time andsandwich course students in Great Britain in1981-82 (96 per cent of estimated demand). Themaintenance in 1980-81 of the age-participationrate for 1979-80 (i.e. allowing for the increasedsize of the age group but not for increased per-centage participation) would be consistent with acorresponding figure of 592,000 students in 1981-82.The expansion of non-advanced further educationwould be similarly restricted. On the basis of theseforecasts, the effect would be that a further 11,000potential HFE students might not find places inthe Autumn of 1980.14. Cmnd. 6393 made provision for growth ofH per cent a year in unit non-teaching costs inthe maintained sectors of higher and further educa-tion. It will not be possible, within the base figures,to maintain this growth in 1980-81. Local authori-ties have consistently maintained that an annual increase in non-teaching unit costs is inescapableon account of the introduction of new buildings,changing teaching methods, and increased sophisti-cation of new equipment; and that to keep thesecosts at a constant level would reduce educationalstandards. On the other hand just as there arediseconomies of scale where numbers are falling(paragraph 7) so there are economies to be expectedwhere numbers are rising.Libraries15. The British Library would be able to maintainsufficient growth in current expenditure to meet the inevitable increase in its collections. But accommo-dation problems would increase with a standstill on capital expenditure in 1980-81.16. The public libraries would be able to meet their current expenditure requirements only at theexpense of their capital programmes.SCOTLANDIMPLICATIONS OP SURVEY FIGURES17. The then Secretary of State for Scotland made it clear before the publication of Cmnd. 6393 thatin his view the figures for this programme were not sufficient to carry out the policies described there.The level of local authority spending underlying therate support grant settlement for 1976-77 had notbeen fully carried through to the later years. TheRSG settlement had, however, exceeded the public expenditure limits and the Treasury was not pre-pared to agree that this should be carried through to the later years in the form of additions to totalScottish programmes. The base figures reflect thisdecision. The Department consider that the basefigures make it impracticable to provide a Teason-able enhancement factor for unit non-teaching costs in schools and further education: they wouldrequire a lowering of unit costs by 2 per cent between 1976-77 and 1977-78 and a restoration tothe 1976-77 level would not be possible until1979-80. For the same reason they consider thatthe limits would also involve significant cut-backsin expenditure below 1976-77 levels in relation to social and recreational education, libraries and administration. In addition, the limits would be insufficient to meet the latest forecasts of expendi-ture on school meals, teacher salaries and the levelof demand for higher and further education.18. The following are forecasts of the pupil,student and teacher numbers for which the expendi-ture limits would provide. For the years to 1979-80these numbers are lower than those provided for in cmnd. 6393, with the exception of student numbers.Thouands	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Schools:					Under-fives (including					nursery)	31	31	32	33	33Primary pupils.	599	578	558	535	512Secondary pupils to 16	343	345	341	339	332Secondary pupils over 16 .	61	64	69	71	75Special school pupils.	14	14	15	15	15Teachers	54	53	52	51	49Non-advanced FE students .	59	60	62	63	64Higher education students .	32	32	32	33	3419. The overall school population will fall by over 80.000 during the Survey period with onlythe number of pupils over school age showing any significant increase. Although this produces savings in expenditure on schools it is partly offset byadditional expenditure arising from the increase inthe number of students in further and higher education over the period.

The staffing standards consistent with Cmnd.6393 are:Under fives . 29 0:1Primary       .   23-3 :1Secondary    .   15-4 :1 (reducingto 15-6 :1 asaveragerolls increased)Teacher numbers consistent with this policy wouldbe:Thousands1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-81School meals24. The Department shares the views of the DESon the implications of the decision of May 5 to postpone the previously intended increase in theprice of the school meal (see paragraph 10). Theproposal to delay each prospective increase to thefollowing September gives rise to the following additional bid:  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80      1980-8154 54 53 52 51 2-6 2-9 2-3 0-4Thus the teaching force would reduce further in1980-81 to 50,500. If further provision is not madefor the increased cost of teachers&apos; salary increments(see paragraph 40 below) there would be a further reduction to 49,500 as shown in the table inparagraph 18.21. The policies announced in Cmnd. 6393 for capital programmes would be extended to 1980-81.The expenditure limits provide for building startsprogrammes as follows:  million1976 1977 1978 1979 1980-77   -78    -79   -80   -81Under fives . .2-3 0-8 0-6 0-6 0-6Primary and secondary basicneeds   ....   34-0 28-9 27-9 27-9 27-9Improvements  .      .      .6-5 2-2 2-2 2-2 2-special schools 2-2 2-2 2-2 2-2 2-2Higher and further education   10-9 7-7 5-6 7-5 6-5Under fives22. The number of under-fives in nursery andprimary schools, although rising slightly in the lightof the projected limited capital programme, wouldbe significantly below the level forecast in Cmnd.6393 as a consequence of expected shortfall in thetake-up of nursery school investment by authoritiesin 1975-76 and 1976-77.Special schools23. There would be sufficient provision for the continuation of the policies underlying Cmnd. 6393.But this would mean a further postponement ofdesirable projects designed to meet the particularneeds of these children.School milk25. The limits of expenditure provide for the implementation of the legislation now beforeParliament on the same basis as for England andWales (see paragraph 11).Higher and farther education26. The provision in Crand. 6393 would have enabled 96 per cent of the then current estimate of demand to be met up to 1979-80, but the expendi-ture limits would permit only 92 per cent to bemet in 1980-81 because later projections suggestthat unrestrained demand will be higher than was assumed earlier. In order to accommodate 96 percent of the present estimate of demand provision would have to be made for 4,700 additional placesover the baseline figure by 1980-81, This is thesubject of an additional bid.Libraries27. For the reasons given in paragraph 17, theexpenditure limits assume that local authorities willseverely restrict their current expenditure onlibraries from 1977-78 onwards.ENGLAND AND WALESADDITIONAL BIDSSchool transport28. An improved method of calculating schooltransport costs produces the following estimates ofadditional expenditure:  million1977-78      1978-79 ^ 7979-50      1980-812-4 4-3 5-6 6-5
Account has been taken of the transport costsapplicable in the different sectors of education; theneed for additional expenditure reflects growth inthe relatively costly transport of secondary pupilsand pupils requiring special educational treatment.Moreover, the continuing decline in the availability of public transport, especially in rural areas, meansadditional expenditure by local authorities on alter-native forms of transport in meeting their statutory obligations.College of education staff compensation29. The following additions result from a re-assessment of expenditure on payments toredundant College of Education staff:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81-	-	0-6	1-0Teachers&apos; salaries30. The latest information about the effect of salary drift leads to the following estimates ofadditional expenditure to maintain the presentlyintended numbers of teachers (see paragraphs 5and 12):  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	12-2	18-2	24-5	25-6	Higher and farther education31. To continue in 1980-81 the policies in Cmnd.6393 for a 1J per cent annual increase in non-teaching unit costs in the public sector of higherand further education and for provision to meet96 per cent of the forecast unrestricted demand,would require additional expenditure of  7-0 million and  9-0 million respectively in that year.Special schools32. To continue in 1980-81 the Cmnd. 6393 policyof making some progress (2,000 extra places a year)towards providing special school places for allchildren needing such facilities would cost an extra 1-4 million in that year.In-service teacher training33. To complete the expansion of in-service train-ing, to cover 3 per cent of the teaching force in1980-81, would require an additional  15-4 million in that year.National Library of Wales34. To meet an acute accommodation need, theextension of the second bookstack of the NationalLibrary of Wales at Aberystwyfh, would cost an extra  0-5 million in each of the three years up to1979-80.Total additional bids (England and Wales)35. (a) The totals of the additional expendituresdescribed in paragraphs 28-34 above are:  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80	1980-8115-1           23 0          31-2	65-9(b) In addition, the proposal on school meal charges	in paragraph 10 would cost:		  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80	1980-8140 0          49 0          42 0	7-0Tuition fees36. In addition to the above bids for extraresources, the policy proposed by the Secretary ofState in May 1976 would result in smaller economiesthan were allowed for in the costings in Cmnd. 6393.The Secretary of State has undertaken to offset the shortfall on tuition fees by savings elsewhere inhis programmes, provided that his fee proposals are accepted by Ministers. The amount is estimatedat  7 million in 1977-78. For later years, it is upto  19 million, towards which any real increases inthe fees fixed for those years will be available.Offsetting savings37. The list of policy options would be sufficientto cover the savings referred to in paragraph 35and most of the additional bids, to the extent thatthe expenditure limits are not increased to encom-pass them, in addition to the reduction of 3  percent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent thereafter, if required. They would not however cover the costof the additional bid in relation to school mealcharges (paragraph 35(fc)) which the Departmentregards as deriving from the pay settlement andtherefore as a charge against public expendituregenerally.
SCOTLANDadditional bidsSchools: teaching costs38. The following additional expenditure wouldprovide some 1,(00 extra teachers (700 primary and400 secondary) for service in areas of urban depriva-tion where there is a claimant need for additionalteaching resources to overcome social and environ-mental handicap.  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-815-0	5-0	5-0	5 0School building: capital39. The major reorganisation of local governmentin Scotland in May 1975 disrupted building pro-grammes, and the back-log of starts at 31 March1975 and 1976 was greater than expected by  24-3 million and  8-5 million respectively. This altersthe incidence of expenditure to be expected fromthese starts. The following additional bid is tocover the estimated shift into the Survey period: itmay be regarded as partly offset by savings in capital expenditure on nursery school buildingalready surrendered to the Contingency Reserve.  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-794-9	5-3	1-1Teachers&apos; salary drift40. As for England and Wales, revised assessment of the effect of salary drift has revealed the follow-ing additional expenditure requirements to maintainexisting policy on primary and secondary schoolstaffing:  million1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-811-0 2 0 3 1 4 0 4-9Salary drift depends on the existence of incrementalpay scales and is a corollary of the changing agestructure of the teaching profession which in turnreflects the staffing policies of successive govern-ments over a considerable period.  In recent years the effects have been exacerbated by decliningwastage rates as alternative employment opportunities -ties have declined.Teaching and non-teaching costs: schools41. (i) Revised estimate of primary school numbersPrimary school numbers are now estimated to be 1,000 higher than in Cmnd. 6393, and additional provision is required.  million1976-771-2(ii) Non-teaching costs: schools the existing limits do not provide for a l\per cent enhancement factor in non-teachingunit costs from 1977-78, for which thefollowing additional sums would be required:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-815-7	6-4	7-2	1-2A large element of this (between  4 million and  5 million a year) formed part of theclaim for consequentials of the Rate support grant Settlement (see paragraph 17) whichwas based on a 1 per cent annual enhance-ment factor from 1978-79. The Treasuryconsiders that the increased claim for 1-J percent from 1977-78 should be provided byreallocations within Scottish programmes asa whole.School meals42. The following bid arises from the latest school meals census which indicates a higher level of up-take than has been provided for in Crand. 6393.  million1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-811-9 0-7 1-3 1-2 1-1Higher and further education43. As more students are coming forward thanwere anticipated in Cmnd- 6393, additional expendi-ture will be needed if the same proportion of total demand is to be provided for. Additional provision
is also needed to allow a 1-J per cent enhancementfactor in non-teaching unit costs which was not included in Cmnd. 6393 for the reason given inparagraph 17.  The combined effect is:  million1976-77    1977-78     1978-79     1979-80     1980-811-0 1-7 2-3 4 1 5-5Within these totals the amounts required to carry through the Rate Support Grant adjustment for1976-77 into later years (see paragraph 17) are 02 million in 1977-78 and in 1978-79,  0-3 million in 1979-80 and  0-2 million in 1980-81.The Treasury&apos;s view is that there is no commitment to train unlimited numbers of students, and thatincreasing non-teaching unit costs should not benecessary as the rise in student numbers produceseconomies of scale. Insofar as the latter are desir-able, the Treasury thinks that the cost should be offset elsewhere in Scottish programmes, as statedin paragraph 17.Social and recreational education,libraries and administration44. For the reasons given in paragraph 17 the basefigures are not all for the following amounts requiredto maintain 1976-77 levels of current expenditure:  million	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Social and recreational				education	2-0	2-0	2 0	2*0Libraries .	1-5	1-5	1-5	1-5Administration .	2-5	2-5	2-5	2-5Total additional bids (Scotland)45.

A number of savings in all years have alreadybeen surrendered to the contingency reserve ( 9-million in 1979-80) mainly from demographicchanges. The Scottish Office say it is not possibleto propose other offsetting savings.ENGLAND AND WALESpolicy options47. Reductions in public expenditure by 2\ percent in 1977-78 and by 5 per cent annually there-after would, if implemented, require the followingtotal savings on DES and, where relevant, welsh office programmes:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81165	326	326	32748. Under the auspices of the Consultative council for Local Government Finance, the Department arediscussing with the local authority associations whatpossible changes in existing and forthcoming policy should be adopted if expenditure reductions of this magnitude were required. The list of suggestions made at this stage is subject to reconsideration inthe light of the outcome of these discussions.49. The measures that would be required to achieve savings of this magnitude, and also, if need be. to offset ihe additional expenditure discussed in paragraphs 28-34 and 36 above are listed belowin decreasing order of acceptability in each of theconstituent sub-programmes. The Secretary of state would not however be prepared to offset the cost ofthe additional bids in respect of school meal charges(paragraph 10) or the Arts (paragraphs 61-64) bythese measures.50.   commentary on policy options england andwales(a) Reductions in computer board expenditureThese savings represent a halving of the ComputerBoard&apos;s recurrent expenditure from 1977-78, and ofits capital expenditure from 1978-79. reductions on this scale would not only restrict the researchactivities and to a lesser extent the teaching-at universities, but also produce fewer orders for theBritish computer industry.

Assuch, it would be an unpopular measure though not inconsistent with the student grant level. It wouldbe difficult to implement precipitately in full. the costings are accordingly based on a phased intro-duction over three years from 1977-78.(d) Library services the reductions would imply for the British Librarysavings of  0-5 million in 1977-78,  11 million in 1978-79 and  1-2 million in 1979-80. Thiswould necessitate the postponement of the Library&apos;splan for developing its technical services, and inparticular for installing its own computer. Theremainder of the reduction would have to be at theexpense of the book conservation programme.Insofar as the Library could increase its earningscapacity as the Treasury believes it could-theseeffects could be abated, or the saving increased. Inthe public libraries the cuts could only be achieved by reducing services, and might in some casesinvolve reduction of the book-fund at the risk of creating permanent gaps in acquisition.(e) Postponement of induction training and expan-sion of in-service training the postponement of the introduction of inductiontraining and the expansion of in-service training for teachers for a further two years, i.e. until September1979, would correspondingly restrict the demand forqualified teachers and thus make it more difficult for those newly trained to find posts. It is expected
that the additional excess* in each year of teachersupply over demand implied by this proposal wouldbe:1977-78        1978-79        1979-80        1980-912,000 6,000 6,000 8,000This further restriction would also increase the redundancy problems of the training institutionsthemselves. Desirable improvement in the quality of the teaching force would be further delayed.(/) Reduction of non-teaching costs in higher andfurther educationLocal authorities would have to be asked to limitnon-teaching unit costs to the 1976-77 level. Acorresponding reduction would have to be made inuniversity recurrent grant. This compares with theCmnd. 6393 provision of 1  per cent cumulativeannual growth from 1976-77 to 1979-80 in thepublic sector (and an additional bid to continue this in 1980-81). Local authorities have consistentlymaintained that to hold non-teaching unit costsconstant would result in a reduction of standards and that falling student numbers in teacher trainingwould require higher unit costs to offset dis-economies of scale. The Treasury believes that itshould be possible to achieve economies of scale in the higher and further education sector as a wholesince numbers will be rising significantly throughthe period.(g) Restriction of higher education provision to 95per cent of Cmnd. 6393 levelThe effect of this option would be that significantnumbers of qualified students (about 19,000) seeking to pursue courses of higher education would eithernot be able to find places or would have to be accomodated at the expense of educationalstandards. The savings relate to staffing and non-teaching costs, as well as to student support, and* Uncertainties about future wastage rates and to an increasing extent the result of integrating teacher training with otherhigher education courses make forecasting particularly difficult.But best estimates suggest that if the staffing policies announced in Grind. 6393 were implemented, the potential excess supply of people qualified as teachers in September would be as follows:1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980S116,000        24,000 30,000        32,000it would therefore be necessary to reduce staffingcomplements. This could be achieved by wastagebut only with difficulty. This option would mean that the staffing standards of departments andfaculties could be subject to the randomness of wastage. The Secretary of State&apos;s proposals fortuition fees would have the effect of reducing from1977-78 onwards the numbers of students forecast in Cmnd. 6393. The implementation of those pro-posals would reduce the numbers of students stillfurther.(h) Reduction of building programmes following table provides a comparison betweenthe building starts programmes underlying Cmnd.6393 and those which would be required (theCmnd. 6393 figures, revalued to 1976 Survey prices,are shown in brackets, where they differ):  million1976 1977 1978 1979 1980-77    -78       -79      -80    -81Under-fives              . 10 - (5) - (3) 3 3Primary and secondarybasic needs           . 133 119     114 109 109Improvements          . 22 - (16) - (16) 11 (16) 11 (16)Special schools .      . 11 - (8)  - (8) 8        8Higher and further education 33 18 (33) 26 (43) 43 43The basic needs programme for additional school places would be preserved at the level requiredmainly for the shift in population from area to areathroughout the period. But the existing provisionfor the improvement and replacement of schoolswould be abandoned for 1977-78 and 1978-79.This would leave many urban areas with no build-ing programmes for two years; it would impedecomprehensive reorganisation; and, because of thepractical difficulties of programme management,could lead to under-provision for basic needs insome areas of population growth.These reductions in the provision for schoolimprovements would be accompanied by a two-yearmoratorium on nursery provision and on the pro-vision of new special schools. This would implyunsatisfactory nursery accommodation remaining in use and children who ought to be in special schoolswould remain in ordinary schools where their special needs could not be fully met.In Further Education, reductions in the building programme would mean even more intensive use of
existing premises than required by the Cmnd. 6393policies. Resources for fire precautions and other requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Actwould not be available and adaptations needed toensure the full use of vacant science places andthe maximum use of the former colleges of educa-tion might have to be postponed. As the building programmes for universities are already very small,significant savings could not be made without pre-judicing the expansion of medical provision requiredto meet the needs of the National Health Service.(i) Restriction of provision for under-fivesThis option implies that provision for under-fiveswould be reduced by 20 per cent from September1977. In order to achieve the savings, localauthorities would have to be persuaded to reduce their staff by about 3,000 teachers in each year andto make the corresponding savings on non-teachingcosts. This would produce a concomitant increasein the numbers of unemployed teaching and non-teaching staff. In a time of falling primary schoolnumbers, the savings would also depend on localauthorities taking existing accommodation out of use.if) Restriction of non-advanced further Educationprovision to 95 per cent of Cmnd. 6393 levelThis option is similar in concept to Option (g)above, and like considerations apply.As in the case of that option the implementation ofthe Secretary of State&apos;s proposals for tuition feeswould reduce student numbers still further. Prioritywould be given to protecting as far as possible pro-vision for the 16-19 age group, but this would implyproportionately more severe restrictions on other non-advanced further education.(k) School meals reductions of subsidyThis proposal assumes first that the additional bidin paragraph 10 is accepted. It is therefore tanta-mount to a partial reduction of that bid (albeitagainst different circumstances). It is not an optionfor reducing the base figures. It would require thecharge to be raised by lOp to 25p in September1977. This was the level contemplated in Cmnd.6393. Further substantial increases would berequired in successive Septembers; the ultimate effect would be to reduce the average subsidy on the mealto about 23 per cent by 1980-81. It is at present about 67 per cent.Local education authorities have already expressed concern that resources from the education pro-gramme are now being used to subsidise school meals by over  350 million a year. The authorities may, therefore, be expected to judge reductions in public expenditure on school meals preferable toalternative policies which would impact directly on educational objectives.(/) Reduction of teaching force by 1 per cent from1977-78The Cmnd. 6393 policy allowed for the maintenance in later years of the 1975-76 separate staffing ratiostn primary and secondary schools, which implied animprovement from 19-6:1 in 1975-76 to 18-6:1 in1980-81 in Ihe overall ratio, as a greater proportionof pupils entered secondary education. As a resultof this option the overall staffing ratio would improve only to about 18-8:1 in 1980-81.Although uncertainties about future wastage rates,and, to an increasing extent, the results of inte-grating teacher training with other higher educationcourses, make the forecasting of teacher supply overpotential demand particularly difficult, it is to beexpected that option (0 would add some 3,000teachers per year to the excess expected from Cmnd.6393 policies, and this option some 4,500 in eachyear to those figures. It has been assumed that allthese reductions could be met within the naturalwastage of the teaching profession, without any call for compensation for early retirement or redund-ancy i.e. through reducing the recruitment ofnewly trained teachers.(m) Reduction of non-teaching costs in schoolsGenerally similar considerations to those outlinedunder option (f) apply also to schools. In viewhowever of the increased units costs resulting fromthe increasingly rapid decline in primary school population and, after 1978, from the fall in thenumber of pupils in secondary schools where already the proportion of older pupils-for whom pro-vision is relatively expensive is increasing, thisoption implies a progressive and cumulative erosionof standards.The following two options would require con-controversial, emergency legislation which would haveto be enacted before the beginning of 1977-78.If this could not be contemplated it would benecessary to increase the scale of some of theearlier options.
(n) Introduction of library chargesThis option is based on the assumption that some10 million library users could initially be charged 2 per year for the service. Allowance is made forexemptions, for fall-off in demand, and for the costs of administration.(o) Capitation fee for school pupilsIn order to provide the savings claimed this optionwould have to apply to pupils of compulsory schoolage, thus introducing a charge for an educationalservice provided free hitherto this century. the option would also have to apply to school pupilsoutside the compulsory age range and to thosestudents aged 16 to 18 in non-advanced further education who pay no fees at present. legislation would be required to amend the 1944 education act: it would be highly controversial to pass and difficult to implement. The figure of  10 would need to be revalued each yearSCOTLANDpolicy options51. The requirement to reduce public expenditure by 2\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent annuallythereafter would, if implemented, require thefollowing savings:  million1977-781978-791979-801980-8117 033 032 032-052. The measures that would be required to achieve these savings are listed below, in descendingorder of acceptability to the Department:  million1977 1978 1979 1980-78   -79   -80    -81(a) Libraries:usercharge 2-0   2 0    2 0    2-0(A) Abandonment of schoolbuildingstarts programme from 1977-78    .....    1-9    4-1    4-8    5-0(e) Restriction of higher and further education provision to 95 percent of Cmnd, 6393   . 1-2    2-6   4 0    5-5W) School   meals:   reduction   of subsidy .      .      .1-82-21-71-9(e) Reduction of teaching force by1 per cent in 1977-78 and5 per cent in subsequent years    2-5   12-5   12-0   120(/) Capitation fee of  10 for schoolpupils and students in non-advanced further education .    7-9    7-8    7-6    7-4Total17 3   31 2  32 1   3353. The implications of these policy changes areoutlined below.(a) Libraries.   This would require legislation ofa contentious nature to be enacted before1977-78. The fee would be of the order of 2 initially and would be revalued in line with prices in order to produce a constantyield. Treasury officials do not believe thisoption to be feasible except in an emergencysituation.(b) School building.   This would involve a com-plete stoppage of all the school buildingstarts programmes from 1977-78 for under-fives, special schools and school improve-ment. The basic needs programme would be preserved.(c) Higher and further education.   On the basisof the Cmnd. 6393 planning figure, thisoption would make it necessary to restrict the number of admissions to higher andfurther education by up to 1,250 in Autumn1980.(d) School meals.    This  proposal  follows  the option put forward by the DES(e) Reduction of teaching force.   This proposal would lead to a reduction in the teachingforce of 2,500 by 1980-81. Achievement ofthis reduction could depend on the outcome of litigation over the contract of service which the teachers have negotiated with localauthorities.(/) A  10 capitation fee. This option would introduce a charge, initially  10, for those incompulsory education. It would also applyto pupils over school age and students under18 in non-advanced further education. Intro-duction would be dependent on the introduc-tion of highly contentious legislation.SCIENCEimplications of survey figures54. The policies announced in Cmnd. 6393 whkh,after allowance has been made for the transfer of funds from the DES Science Budget to customerdepartments under the arrangements set out in cmnd. 5046, &quot; Framework for Government research and Development&quot;, would broadly restrict theresources of the Research Councils to the levelattained in 1972-73, would be carried forward afurther year to the end of the new Survey Period.
policy options55. Reductions of 1\ per cent in 1977-78 and5 per cent thereafter would require the followingsavings:  million1977 1978 1979 1980-78   -79   -80    -81(a) Further curtailment of SRC bigscience      ....      1       3       3       3(6) Reductions in resources forother Research Council&apos;s pro-grammes in agricultural, health and environmental research .2 4 4 4(c) Reduction of SRC support forscjenceandegineering ..2      4      4      456. The effect of these reductions would be asfollows:(a) The zero-growth strategy adopted for Cmnd.6393 would already entail sharply reducing expenditure in the big science fields sup-ported by the Science Research Council (highenergy physics, space science and astronomy),in order to sustain growth in other fieldssupported by that Council, especially inapplied science and engineering; and in basicsciences supported by other research councils which underpin government policies in agriculture, health and the en-vironment. This means that total expendi-ture on big science including international commitments would decline by 25 per cent,and domestic expenditure by 35 per cent, by1980-81. Only small savings (up to  3 mil-lion a year) could be found by furtherrunning down high energy physics at theprice of heavy redundancies and under-useof our share of international facilities, andby deferring the full implementation of theNorthern Hemisphere Observatory project.(o) Elimination of the modest growth proposedin the resources allocated by other research councils (ARC, MRC, NERC, SSRQ would produce about  4 million a year, with no allowance for incremental creep or sophistica-tion. This would significantly reduce thelevel of scientific activity in agricultural,medical and environmental research, not onlyin Research Councils&apos; own institutions butalso in the universities,(c) The reversal of present policies proposed bythe Science Research Council with support from industry. Government departments, and universities, to expand and improve thetraining of engineering manpower and todevelop new forms of academic/industrial research would produce  4 million a year.ARTSimplications of survey figures57. The planned expenditure for 1977-78 willenable existing policies to be carried out at minimumlevels: providing additional resources, for example,only to man new national museum and gallerybuildings already under construction and to bring into full use the new National Theatre. The museumand gallery figures in England already allow forstaffing reductions at two Departmental museums aspart of the reductions in Civil Service staff costs.58. On the basis of the planned expenditure for1978-79 on the two following years it will not bepossible to sustain existing policies. The nationalcollections will have to reduce opening hours toobtain the margin required for manning new exten-sions. The Arts Council will have to reduce its current subsidies to an extent which will require atleast one national company to close down and willcurtail support for the Regional Arts Associations.Capital provision for housing the arts will have tobe reduced by more than half.59. In 1979-80 and 1980-81, provision for the arts council will improve slightly compared with 1978-79,but this will still not enable it to maintain existing obligations. Provision for the national collectionsand housing the arts will be the same as in 1978-79,except that the building programme for the nationalcollections will be reduced to a negligible level.60. No provision is made in the period for imple-menting Public Lending Right; for introducingGovernment help for museum schemes of more thanlocal significance; or for tackling the long-termstorage and film preservation problems of theNational Film Archive.additional bids i england and wales south Bank Theatre Board61.  0-5 million in 1978-79 would be required toallow for additional expenditure on claims arisingfrom the contract. With existing planned provision,this would provide  0 - 7 million which is theminimum that can realistically be allowed.
Arts Council62.  3-5 million in 1978-79 and  2-5 million in1979-80 and in 1980-81 to enable the Council tomaintain existing levels of support and to providethe additional resources required by the RoyalShakespeare Company because of its move to thenew theatre in the Barbican, now under construction.Museums and galleries capital expenditure63.  0-5 million in 1978-79 and  10 million ineach of the years 1979-80 and 1980-81 is theminimum addition which the Department ofEducation and Science require to enable existingplanned projects to be carried through.Public Lending Right64.  0-5 million in 1978-79 would provide for the costs of appointing a registrar and of setting up themachinery prior to the start of payments to authors. 1-5 million in 1979-80 and 1980-81 would allow for payment of  1 million to authors in additionto the running costs of  0-5 million which is theminimum regarded by the Minister for the Arts as reasonable in the context of the Bill now passing through Parliament.ADDITIONAL BIDS: SCOTLANDMuseums and galleries65.

The Treasuryconsiders the Scottish Office bid should be dis-allowed, as the Chief Secretary rejected consequen-tial expenditure flowing from the RSG settlement for 1976-77.POLICY OPTIONS67. The DES, SED and Welsh Office believe thatthe reductions sought, particularly from 1978-79 on,would entail fundamental changes in the scale and character of national support for the arts, bearing inmind that, as explained in paragraph 58 above, thepresent provision after 1977-78 is already inadequate to sustain existing policies. The Treasury considersthat the options, which for a 5 per cent reduction would still represent a level of support for the artsabove that which prevailed up to 1974-75, could ifnecessary be achieved by requiring equivalentmarginal reductions in the three main areas ofexpenditure the Arts Council and other arts; thenational collections; and local museums and galleries.ENGLAND68.  million1977 1978 1979 1980-78    -79    -80   -81(a) Reductions in support for Royal&apos;Shakespeare Company andother National Companies orcurtailment of support forArts in the regions and a ^   2 3moratorium on most capital fprojects ....(6) Shorter opening hours/weekendclosures at National Collec-tions....._(c) Reductions in current expendi-ture on local museums and galleries    ....      1       1       1       IThe DES considers that a 2-J per cent cut in 1977-78would entail shorter opening hours and weekendclosures at the national collections, as well as areduction in the Arts Council grant. The Councilconsiders that, in addition to reducing support forthe arts in the region by one third, the only effective way of achieving savings would be to withdraw sup-port from one major company e.g. the RoyalShakespeare Company. This would mean that thenew theatre in the Barbican, being built for it by theCity of London would not be tenanted by the Com-pany. It would be possible to save  0 - 8 million on capital provision for the national collections bydeferring the air conditioning planned for theNational Gallery, and by halving the programme forminor projects. The Treasury believe it should bepossible to find the savings required by a combina-tion of measures, including shading of individual
grants for current expenditure on the arts, althoughthe Council consider that the latter would be theleast cost effective solution and cause maximumdamage to artistic standards.69. Talcing into account the additional resourcesrequired for the full operation of the national theatre and for the move of the Royal ShakespeareCompany to the Barbican in 1978-79, the DESestimates that the Arts Council subsidies for thenational companies would need to be at least 10 million in each of the years 1978-81. Plannedexpenditure under the Survey ground rules involves areduction in the Councils current grant by  2-5 mil-lion. A cut of 5 per cent on this reduced provision would mean a further reduction of  3 million, i.e. 5-5 million, in all. The Council would be likely todecide to halve the support for the four nationalcompanies. The alternative, against many policyobjections, would be to find part or all of the savings from the Councils support for art outside london, currently  6 million in England of which 2-5 million is for regional arts associations. Itwould be possible to impose a total moratorium onall capital projects of any size, including Housing the arts. This would save  1-5 million in each year,but would prevent the adaptation of the MillbankMilitary Hospital for the Tate Gallery and anyfurther facilities to help the national companies tourmore. A further reduction in opening hours andweekend closures at the national collections wouldalso need to be made to save  0-3 million.SCOTLAND70. The illustrative reductions required for scotland on Programme 10 as a whole have been described in paragraphs 51-53 above, and do not affect the arts element of ft.wales71. The options as applied to the National Museumand National Library would call for the followingcuts for the two institutions together:  million1977-78        lord-79        1979-800*1 0-2 0-2Such reductions would mean cuts in staff or in administrative costs leading to closure of the institu-tions on at least one day in each week. Theminimum provision for capital expenditure whichwould remain after any cut would have to betransferred to the current provision to meet highmaintenance costs on an older building. pressure on accommodation, exhibition and storage space is such that reducing capital would be a matter of last resort.96SECRET

In the years 1976-77 to 1979-80, the provision is the same as in Cmnd. 6393. The programme as awhole would grow by 1  per cent a year. Thiswould be just adequate to maintain standards for the increasing numbers of old people and children incare and to permit the continuing spread of new methods of treatment. Within the total, hospital and community health current expenditure wouldgrow by 14 per cent a year, and personal social services current expenditure by 2 per cent; from1977-78 onwards the level of capital expenditure would remain unchanged. Family practitioner ser-vices would continue to grow at an average of3 3 per cent a year, in line with demand and withthe numbers of doctors and dentists entering these services.2. In 1980-81 an increase of 0-4 per cent has beenmade in family practitioner services to allow fordemographic changes, mainly the increasing numbersof old people, but this would not cover the fullincrease in demand forecast for these services inthat year. No allowance has been made for demo-graphic pressures on the hospital and community health and personal social services. The provisionfor 1980-81 would thus imply a significant fall in standards, contrary to the policy adopted in cmnd. 6393-Additional bids(a) Demand determined services and other require-ments for the maintenance of existing policies3. The following provision is needed in 1980-81to meet the balance of the increased demand fore-cast for the family practitioner services, and theadditional demand for health and personal social services arising from demographic factors and fromthe growing number of children in care.  millionJ980S1Family practitioner services .       , 29-7Health current expenditure (1 percent minimumgrowth) . .      .      . .       43-7Personal social services current expenditure (2 per cent minimum growth)     , 19-3Following the last Survey, Ministers agreed thatthese needs should be met in the period up to1979-80, and it would therefore seem right to accept these additional bids for 1980-81.4. Provision of  12 million is needed in each case to meet the cost to the NHS of the Jubilee holidayin 1977 and the May Day holiday in subsequent years. The NHS has to continue operating on public holidays and must meet the marginal additionto staff costs; similarly  6 million is needed for extranon-staff costs in Leap Year (1980).5. A further \ per cent growth in health current expenditure is needed in 1980-81 to permit aminimum spread of improved methods of treatment;without this provision the NHS would fall behind asmedical science advances internationally. Thiswould cost  211 million.6. There are already indications that the localauthorities will find it very difficult to contain the pressures on the personal social services within the2 per cent annual growth provided from 1977-78
onwards. These pressures include the rising numberof old people (especially those over 75) and ofchildren in care, and other growing problems suchas injuries inflicted on children and family violence.Unless further provision is made to meet thesepressures, existing standards of services will have tobe cut. The Health Departments therefore recom-mend provision of a 3 per cent growth rate incurrent expenditure as being more realistic than the2 per cent in the present programme; the additional cost would be:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-818-8	18-1	280	38-4(b) Proposals for new developments7. The Government has accepted the recommenda-tion in the Briggs Report for a new pattern ofeducation and training for nurses and midwives, andthis is one of the first priorities for additional expenditure in the NHS. The incidence of this expenditure would depend on the timing of legisla-tion and on progress in introducing the new arrangements. The cost would build up eventually to about  40 million a year but the phasing withinthe Survey period is not fixed. The pattern is esti-mated provisionally as follows:  million1979-80	1980-816-1	11-18. The following table summarises the cost of theadditional bids:  million	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Category (a) bids	20-8	30 1	46-0	164-3Category (A) bids	-	 	6-1	111Total	20-8	30-1	52-1	175-4The programme with the category (a) bids wouldbe just adequate to maintain standards in the nhs and to permit the family practitioner services to meet forecast demand. The Health departments have severe doubts as to whether anything less than3 per cent a year growth would be realistic for the personal social services. Over the period 1976-77to 1980-81 the average annual growth of the pro-gramme as a whole with the additional bids is1 - 8 per cent. This represents a substantial cut backcompared with recent years. The position would remain very difficult, and might have to be reviewedas the Survey proceeds in the months ahead.Policy options9. The following cuts would be required to reduce expenditure on the health and personal social ser-vices by 2$ per cent in	1977-78	and 5 per centthereafter:				  million1977-78       1978-79	1979-80	1980-81165              335	341	341If such cuts for 1980-81 were made from a starting point which excluded bids arising from demographicand demand factors they would imply a reductionof 7 per cent from the level of resources needed tomaintain standards. The severity of the cuts in1980-81 would be much greater than the rulesintend for programmes generally in that year, and greater for the health and personal social servicesthan in earlier years. The Health Departmentstherefore believe that the bids for 1980-81 whichreflect demographic and demand factors should be incorporated in the Survey figures before cuts are considered.10. Even so, coming on top of the cuts made in cmnd. 6393, the reductions could be achieved only by radical measures, including some that might beseen as repugnant to the basic principles of the nhs. In particular, if the full weight of these cutswere not to fall on services, ways would have to befound of raising more income from charges leviedon those who can afford to pay. But even with more income from charges, important priorities forrelatively deprived services for the mentally ill,the mentaffy handicapped: and the e/derfy-couldonly be sustained (or partially sustained) if somedeliberate check were imposed on expenditure inother fields, which would mean in particular restric-tions on services in the acute sector and consequentconstraint on the treatment that could be providedfor individual patients.
11. Possible measures that could be considered in circumstances where there was overriding need toreduce expenditure are shown in the table below and explained briefly in the notes that follow. together the measures amount to more than 24 per cent and5 per cent of expenditure in the respective years andin some cases a range of possible savings is indi-cated. It must be emphasised however that thereare no easy options, only hard choices; and that none of these measures is recommended by the health Departments and none in any way plannedor selected.  million1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81(a) Increased chargesVarious increases in yield from prescription charges from April 1977 .      .   25-35    25-35    25-35    25-15Pull cost of road accidentsrecovered by levy on in-surance companies from april 1978  ...     -     40       40        40Hospital meal charges of la day from April 1978(with various exemptions) -        25        25        25Various increases in charges for dental treatment from april or October 1977   .   22-30    22-60    22-60   22-60A 100 per cent charge forlenses from April 1977(except exempt classes) .6 6 6 653-71   118-166 118-166 118-166(e) Cuts in servicesHealth capital . . 25-35 35-70 35-70 35-70Health current growth Jper cent-zero . . 40-60 71-110 103-162 83-162Personal Social Services:Capital . . . 0-28 0-30 0-30 0-30Current growth 2-1per cent               . -         0-10 0-18 0-965-123 106-220 138-280 118-271Grand total   .      . 118-194 224-386 256-446 236-437Prescription charges12. A number of measures could be consideredwith a view to reducing the net cost of drugs pres-cribed in the NHS. From an administrativestandpoint the simplest step would be to raise thepresent 20p prescription charge across the board;the additional yield from a charge of 40p (equiva-lent to the real value of the charge in 1971) wouldbe  about   35   million.    The  increase  wouldmarginally affect the Retail Price Index. However,the Government has not so far been willing to take this step and there are strong political objections.Other possibilities are for some kind of differentialcharging for drugs. A &quot; white list&quot; might be estab-lished of drugs to be available to NHS patientseither free or at the present charge of 20p, leavingdrugs not on this list to be charged either at a higherfixed level or at some proportion of full cost. great difficulties and consequent delay would be encountered in drawing up a &quot; white list&quot; on otherthan an arbitrary basis; and in any case primarylegislation would be required. With an arbitrarylist it might not be reasonable to impose a chargesignificantly higher than 20p on drugs excluded from it that were necessary for treatment. Any &quot; whitelist &quot; would have implications for the pharmaceuticalindustry, particularly for its exports, the loss ofwhich might well be of the same order as the public expenditure saving. Pharmacists might object toany complex scheme, and their remuneration mighthave to be increased. In view of the difficulties anduncertainties of any move towards differentialcharging, it would be unsafe to count on any largesavings; a provisional sum of  25 million has been shown in the table.Recovery of full cost of road accidents13. The Road Traffic Act 1960 provides for smallpayments in limited circumstances towards the costto the NHS of traffic accidents. It is estimated thatif the cost were recovered in full by a levy oninsurance companies related to income from motor vehicle business, the additional yield would be about 40 million a year. Legislation would be required;this would have to be preceded by discussions withother Departments and with the insurance com-panies. To introduce the change by April 1978,planning would have to start quickly and a suitablelegislative opportunity be found in 1976-77. perhapsby an addition to the proposed Bill on drink anddriving.Hospital meals charge14. It would be possible to recover from hospitalpatients a contribution towards meals and other&quot; hotel &quot; costs. The gross yield of a daily charge of 1, with various exemptions and exclusions, wouldbe about  45 million but this would be reduced byabout  20 million by administrative costs and over-lap with the present deductions from social security
benefits. However, legislation would probably berequired and there would be severe problems bothof principle and practice.  1 a day exceeds the likely cost per head of meals at home in many cases.It is the most which could be paid by those whoseonly available income was retirement pension (or some other social security benefit) if they were tobe left with a minimum of income for other personalrequirements in hospital and for other continuingcommitments at home. Any higher charge wouldrequire special compensatory arrangements for these groups at extra cost. Their position would be muchharsher than under the present arrangements whereby benefits are not abated during the firsteight weeks in hospital and only reduce to &quot; pocketmoney &quot; rates after a year not even then where the patient has dependants. Most families suffer a sub-stantial drop in income when the main wage earneris sick and this would be exacerbated if more ofthat reduced income was needed to meet hospitalexpenses. There would be considerable difficultiesin recovering charges. The more substantial thecharge the greater the possible need to arrange for insurance against the liability, with consequent increase in complexity and administrative costs.Great difficulty could arise if health authorities were required to increase staff to handle this new chargejust when they had been pressed very hard to reducemanagement costs.Increased charges for dental services15. At present no charge is made to anyone fordental examinations, and no charge is made fordental treatment of children and expectant and nursing mothers; people on low income may alsobe excused charges. This represents about half thework of the General Dental Service. Flat ratecharges made for other treatment recover part ofthe cost. In the extreme case these charges could beraised to cover the whole cost of this other treat-ment; the additional income would be about  60million. This would however have profound impli-cations for the dental health of the nation and forthe dental profession and would need to be studiedvery carefully before any decision was taken. Amore feasible proposal would be to increase thepresent yield of charges to a more limited extent that would be consistent with the maintenance ofa viable General Dental Service; a provisional sumof  22 million has been shown in the table.Increased charges for ophthalmic services16. No charge is made for sight tests or for a range of spectacles for children, and people with lowincome may be excused charges. For others, lensesare charged at flat rates; if these charges were raised to cover the whole cost of supply and dispensing,the additional yield would be about  6 million in afull year. There would be some disruption of lensproduction which is just beginning to meet thecurrent high level of demand after many months ofsupply difficulties; this would probably lead toredundancies in Wales.Cuts in services17. As already indicated, growth of 1 per cent ayear is needed to support present standards of the nhs for the changing population and \ per cent ayear for some continuing spread of new methods oftreatment. Overall reductions on the scale of 2-Jper cent and 5 per cent would make it impossible tomaintain even this &quot; standstill&quot; situation in the nhs. With capital cuts and with current expendi-ture frozen or growing at only -J per cent a year asindicated in the table, the health services would decline progressively throughout the Survey period.In such a situation the Health Departments&apos; firstaim would be to try to maintain priority for services for the elderly, mentally ill and mentally handi-capped, in line with the policies suggested in theDepartments&apos; Consultative Documents. This couldonly be done however by putting the acute services under severe constraint, and measures would be needed to limit expenditure on new equipment (with serious effects on the industry, and its exportspotential contrary to Government industrial strategy)and to induce some reduction in the average lengthof stay of patients in hospital. This constraintwould lead to greatly extended waiting lists and ageneral falling off of standards of care. Hospitalclosures and staff redundancies (many in areasalready suffering high unemployment) would be unavoidable. New initiatives in the field of training(Briggs, Merrison and vocational training for GPs)would have to be postponed or abandoned. If allgrowth in current expenditure were halted, it wouldnot be possible even to protect the priorities forthe elderly and other deprived groups.18. The capital cuts shown would also have severeconsequences. They would require a moratoriumon all new hospital and health centre schemes during
the Survey period. If cuts were kept to the lowerend of the range, it would be possible to provide some new facilities badly needed for geriatric andpsychiatric services and to provide the hospitalfacilities needed for the teaching programme; but in wales existing commilments would make thisimpossible.19. In the personal social services, as already indi-cated, the Health Departments consider that a growth of 3 per cent a year is the realistic require-ment to maintain present standards. If cuts were required, there could be no question of undertakingany of the additional social work training recom-mended in a national working party report. Therewould be the greatest difficulty if local authorities were obliged to reduce their capital and currentexpenditures as shown in the table and to acceptthe political and other consequences of the severeshortfall in services of all kinds, especially thoseneeded for the elderly, for children in care and forthe disabled.

The programme totalshowever include only the net Exchequer cost of the extension in 1977-78 of child benefit to the first child of two parent families.
I.  EXISTING POLICIES1. The bulk of the Social security Programme isonly controllable by two means: (1) the policy adopted towards uprating benefits, which is con-strained by legislation; and (2) the statutoryconditions governing the award of benefits. DHSSpoint out that it has generally been judged imprac-ticable to withdraw a cash benefit once it has been instituted.2. The programme figures are critically dependenton, and indeed can only be calculated by using,the economic assumptions settled by the Treasury.They are subject to a significant margin of erroreither way.3. So as to comply with the PESC ground rulesagreed by the Cabinet, this year&apos;s base-line tableuses last ye&amp;r&apos;s estimating assumptions (as regardsnumbers of beneficiaries, earnings and price move-ments, and so on). The amounts, negative orpositive, needed to bring the figures into line withthis year&apos;s assumptions are shown separately under&quot; additional bids &quot; in paragraph 5 below. DHSShold this new method of calculating the base-line to be seriously misleading, on the grounds that itis not open to Ministers to consider, for acceptanceor rejection, &quot; proposals &quot; to incur additional expen-diture resulting solely from estimating changes, orto react by, for example, paying some, but not all,those qualifying for unemployment benefit. as explained above, the generality of expenditure inthe social security programme is governed by statuteor by uprating policy which is itself constrainedby statute. Furthermore, any attempt to offset theestimating changes in any year by introducingamending legislation reducing the rate, or limiting the conditions of benefit, even if practical politics,would run up against the following difficulties (i) unless the Government were content to envisagea decline in the scope of social security, &quot; adverse &quot;estimating changes could not be treated as justifi-cation for restrictive legislation unless &quot; favourable &quot;changes were regarded as grounds for liberalisingbenefit conditions: (ii) it would undermine the stability of the social security arrangements if eachyear&apos;5 estimating changes had to be regarded as pro-viding a prima jade case for amending the benefitprovisions: (iii) it must be expected that sometimes(as this year) the net effect of the estimating changes will be favourable in some future years and adversein others, and no feasible changes in legislation could serve to offset both sorts of divergence (yetParliament could hardly be expected to acceptrevisions based solely on the years of &quot; adverse&quot;change especially as these are likely to be yearswhen the need for the maximum amount of social security help will be at its highest).Additional bids4. The Secretary of State for Social Services isobliged by statute to review the rate of mobilityallowance annually, and has already announcedthat the allowance will not be increased inNovember 1976. Apart from the pressure whichwould arise to maintain the value of allowancefrom November 1977 the Secretary of State wishesat that uprating to improve its real value and toextend entitlement in order to assist in ending thepresent vehicle service scheme. The rate he pro-poses is  7 a week an increase of  2. The costof the bid, after allowing for savings from the with-drawal of trikes, is shown in the following table.The Department have not identified any offsetting savings._          million1977-78       1978-79       1979-80       1980-81_2-0_KM)_13-0_17-05. A lower assumption about the growth of realgross earnings means that expenditure on long-term benefits is expected to be lower than shown lastyear in all years. However, this is more than offsetin 1977-78 (and partially so in other years) by anincrease in short-term benefit expenditure as a resultof an increase in the unemployment assumption.The combined effect of these and other estimatingchanges is shown in the table below. The extrarequirement for 1980-81 over 1979-80 is accountedfor by the full year effect of the November 1979uprating and the November 1980 uprating.Uprating policy. The policy towards uprating benefits is asfollows. Long-term benefits are assumed to beincreased in line with the movement of earnings between upratings. Short-term benefits are assumed to be increased in line with the movement of pricesbetween upratings. Such upratings are assumed to take place annually in November. Otherwisebenefits are in general assumed to remain at theirexisting cash value throughout the Survey period.Thus a decline in the real value of child benefit is assumed as previously with family allowances and the same applies to the provision for mobilityallowance and for the death and maternity grants of the national insurance scheme.

Three factors account for the total real improve-ment in benefits shown in columns A above. Onthe Survey assumptions, the four upratings from november 1977 onwards will lead to improvements in the real value of long-term benefits becauseearnings, by reference to the movement of whichlong-term benefits are uprated, will increase faster than prices. The rest of the improvement in long-term benefits and all the improvement in short-term benefits, is accounted for by the level at which the november 1976 uprating was pitched, and by thesmaller decline in the value of benefits betweenupratings as the rate of inflation falls (columns Babove).Family support9. The Child Benefit Act 1975 will come intoforce in April 1977, but full implementation of thescheme which envisaged the withdrawal of childtax allowances, and the replacement of family allowances and child&apos;s interim benefit by a tax-freebenefit for all children has been postponed.10. Instead, from April 1977, provision will be asfollows. Child benefit will be paid at the existingfamily allowance rate of  1-50 a week for second and subsequent children in the family and at therate of  1 a week for first or only children. Likefamily allowances child benefit, including the ratefor the first child, will be taxed and subject toclawback. The existing child interim benefit will cease, but a taxable one-parent family premium of50p a week will be introduced so that one-parent families will continue to receive the same total rate as now for the first child- 1-50 a week.11. The April 1977 changes involve a large grossincrease in public expenditure. The net increase in public expenditure will be less as a result of savings
on other social security benefits, and when account is taken of the accompanying tax changes the netExchequer cost of the new provision will be  75million in 1977-78.12. The figures in the expenditure table assume that the rates of child benefit remain at their April1977 cash levels throughout the Survey period. Theextent of the decline in its real value is indicated by the family benefits line in Table 2.12.Stall13. Between April 1976 and April 1981 the non-industrial staff of the Department (including thecentral administration of the National health service) will increase from 90,072 to 91,337, if additional requirements, which rise to 1,500 by1980, are included. This increase is largelyaccounted for by extra staff required for themaintenance of existing policies, including childbenefit, the re-constructed national insurancescheme, and the new pension scheme. Savings from falling work loads are largely offset by increasesneeded for demand-determined work. The Depart-ment of Employment has 20,900 staff in 1976-77falling to 11,700 in 1980-81 engaged on unemploy-ment and supplementary benefit work.H.  THE PRESSURE FOR INCREASEDEXPENDITURE14. The purpose of this section is to give an indication of DHSS&apos;s views of the likely pressuresfor increased social security expenditure. Whatexisting policy commitments do to the value of thebenefits affected is relevant to the considerationof these pressures. In the absence of offsetting savings, any extra expenditure involved in respond-iug to these pressures would be a charge on the contingency reserve.IS. Although the Child Benefit Act provides forthe rate of child benefit to be reviewed annually,it does not contain any uprating requirement andthe Cabinet have not decided on an upratingpolicy. The real value of child benefits thusdeclines over the Survey period. DHSS believe thatthis may not be tenable and that there win be strong pressure to maintain the value of the April1977 provision, or indeed improve it in real terms.16. After the 1976 uprating the value of national insurance long-term benefits increases in real terms and the value of short-term benefits holds steadyover the Survey period. DHSS believe, however,that more generous upratings of national insurance benefits than those implied in the expenditure pro-objections are likely for two reasons. First, the present policy of uprating benefits in line with current eam-ings and prices movements involves, since upratingshave to be announced some months before they take effect, the prediction of such movements. Inthese circumstances a safety margin over the prices and earnings predictions may be thought desirable.Secondly wider political considerations-like thedesire when settling the 1976 uprating to adopt separately which was related to an aim of the TUC-may create further pressures to increase expenditure.17. The Government is committed to consideringextra provision for existing pensioners when the newpension scheme begins. In the White Paper &quot; BetterPensions&quot; (Cmnd. 5713) the Government under-took that &quot; with the introduction of the new scheme, the position of existing pensioners will befurther reviewed in the light of the development ofthe economy &quot;. As in Cmnd. 6393 no allowance has been made in programme for the result of this review.18. On a different level of expenditure from theforegoing DHSS also draw attention to the pressurethat will be likely to develop to:(i) uprate Family Income Supplement in line with earnings (as will happen this July); and(ii) ease the conditions for the award of thelong-term rate of supplementary allowanceparticularly in relation to the present exclu-sion therefrom of the unemployed.IH.   POLICY OPTIONS19. The application of the Survey ground rulesrequires the display of feasible illustrative optionsfor saving of 1\ per cent ( 300 million) in 1977-78and 5 per cent ( 585 million) in later years.20. What follows sets out a range of measuressome or all of which would have to be adopted to effect savings in the Social security Programme. Theinclusion of an option does not imply any viewabout its political acceptability; the majority would
require legislation which in DHSS&apos;s view would bedifficult to get through. Nor are the options des-cribed in sufficient detail to enable final decisions tobe made. So far as possible the cost calculationstake account of associated changes needed to main-tain coherence in the system of benefit provision,but they do not take account of changes whichmight be needed to make the proposals morepafatabfe. To this extent tie maximum savingsquoted might not be realised. Some options arealternative to, or overlap with, others so that adop-tion of more than one option might not realise thetotal of savings shown.Raising pension age for women23. Amendment of the Act would be needed. Theestimate of savings given below assumes that raising the pension age would need to be done graduallyafter a period of notice so that raising the age byone year would be the most that could be achieved by 1979-80. This would in turn mean that further increases in pension age would not be achieveduntil after the Survey period. Saving would be 12 million in 1979-80 and  36 million in 1980-81.If the age for women could be raised at one stroketo 65, the savings after five years would reach 190 million a year.Deferment of the start of the new pension scheme24. The new pension scheme will begin in April1978 and the improved long-term benefits willbecome payable from April 1979.   Deferring theU prating benefits21. The next paragraph gives estimates of the savings that would accrue from modifying thepresent uprating policy. The savings depend onthe economic assumptions adopted for the survey and in particular (a) and (fr) depend on the relation-ship between the rise in earnings and pricesrespectively.22. On the economic assumptions governing thesocial security expenditure projections, DHSS advise that all four of these options would require amend-ment of the Act.  million1977-78       1978-79        1979-80       1980-815 49 167 3273 25 87 1697 21 33 50-13 6start of the scheme to April 1979 would lead tosavings of  28 million in 1979-80 and  66 million in 1980-81. Deferring the start of the new pension scheme until some date after April 1980, so thatno expenditure on it occurred during the survey period would lead to savings of  42 million in1979-80 and  109 million in 1980-81.Unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners25. Restricting entitlement to unemploymentbenefit for those receiving substantial occupational pension. Many such pensioners claim unemploy-ment benefit when not wanting work. Proofsufficient to disallow benefit is, however, hard toget. Governments of both parties have tried to restrict benefits to those^with modest pensions but have withdrawn the proposals. Amendment of theAct would be required. Savings  12 million.Estimate of savings(a) Uprating long-term benefits in line with the movement of prices betweenupratings rather than in line with the movement of earnings. (The savingsare less than the total real improvements shown in paragraph 7 by theamount of the improvement accounted for by the two factors mentionedin paragraph 8)      .........ok(6) Uprating long-term benefits by more than the movement of prices betweenupratings, but less than the movement of earnings. (The figures relate to half the rise in real earnings) ........(c) Upraiing short-term benefits by less than the movement of prices betweenupratings-that is, allowing the real value of the benefit to fall. (Thefigures relate to one percent: that is the savings were the benefit increases to be one percentage point less than that indicated by the economicassumptions adopted for the Survey)      ......(J) Uprating long-term child dependency benefits by the movement of pricesbetween upratings rather than in line with the movement of earnings
Deferment of the introduction of non-contributoryinvalidity pension for housewives26. The Government^ publicly stated plan is to start the non-contributory invalidity pension forhousewives during 1977-78, but this does not involve a precise starting date within that financialyear. The first year cost of the benefit is  21 niillionnet.Maternity and death grants27. The maternity and death grants are insurance benefits paid on the satisfaction of a simple contrfbu-tion test. Were they instead to be converted to a means-tested benefit the maximum savings would beabout  25 million in a full year. Legislation wouldbe necessary so that it would be difficult to make thechange in time to make any savings in 1977-78.(Maternity grant,  13 million; death grant, 12 million.)Supplementary benefit for young persons28. Raising the age limit for claiming supplemen-tary benefit in one&apos;s own right from 16 to 18 would save  25 million in a full year, ignoring the expendi-ture, which cannot at present be estimated, thatwould result from the fact that some of these 16 to18 year-olds would have parents who were receivingsupplementary benefit which would have to beincreased to take account of the 16 to 18 year&apos;old*s requirements. Legislation would be necessary sothat any savings would be unlikely before 1978-79.Other savings options29. The above options have been drafted inagreement with DHSS. In addition the Treasurybelieve the following further options relating toshort-term national insurance benefits should beconsidered:(i) Removing entitlement to flat-rate unemploy-ment benefit for the first six days of any period of temporary suspension. This would save 300 staff and would not require principallegislation although it would be necessary tobring forward the commencement Orderrequiring an affirmative Resolution in the commons. It would only affect those whostill have jobs. Saving  30 million in1977-78 and  25 million a year thereafter.(ii) Removing entitlement to flat-rate unemploy-ment or sickness benefit for the first sixrather than for the first three days of theperiod of complete interruption of employ-ment. Amendment of the Act would berequired. Saving about  70 million.(iii) Abolition of earnings related supplement paidwith unemployment and sickness and othershort-term benefits. Amendment of the Actwould be required. Saving in the region of 200 million.30. The saving options above are summarised inthe following table:Estimate of benefit savings_  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80      1980-81* Uprating long-term benefits in line with the movement of prices OR * Uprating long-term benefits by more than the movement of prices but less than	5	49	167	327					3	25	87	169* Uprating short-term benefit by one per cent less than the movement of prices .	7	21	33	50* Upraung long-term child dependency benefits by the movement of prices	-	1	3	6	-	-	12	36	-	-	28-42	66-109	-	12	12	13Deferment of the introduction of non-contributory invalidity pension for					21	21	22	22	-	25	25	25	-	25	25	25Removing entitlement for flat rate unemployment benefit for Uie first six days of					30	25	25	25	-	190	160	160* Removing entitlement to flat-rate unemployment or sickness benefit for the				first six days of the period of complete interruption of employment	-	69	66	67* All these items require legislation.
31. Even if it were possible to implement all the options listed above, the savings for 1977-78 and1978-79 would not reach the levels required by theCabinet to be illustrated. The only way of makingthe savings up to the required level would be to postpone the 1977 uprating by, say, substituting twoupratings for the three upratings due in November1977, 1978. and 1979. This would save about 280 million in 1977-78. Savings in 1978-79 and thereafter would depend on the timing of the uprat-ings. This would require legislation and DHSSthink it difficult to imagine the circumstances inwhich it would be possible to obtain approval forsuch legislation, particularly having regard to theimportance placed by the TUC on maintaining theSocial security Programme.Starring consequences of savings proposals32. Changing the basis of uprating proposals hasno effect on staffing levels, and raising the pension age for women very little. Deferring the start of thenew pension scheme would result in a staff saving of the order of 900; and deferring the start of thenon-contributary invalidity pension for housewives a staff saving of about 200. This would largely offset the staff increase referred to in paragraph 13.

The provision for Parliamentary accommodationwill allow the provision and maintenance of essential accommodation and services for theHouses of Parliament. For 1977-78 provision hasbeen made for the additional office accommodation for MPs agreed by Ministers. Nothing has been included for the accommodation costs of broad-casting the proceedings of Parliament. (The BBCscapital costs are dealt with in paragraph 19 below.)Policy options2- The illustrative options would produce the fol-lowing savings on the provision for accommodation:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Reduction in the provision				and maintenance of accom-				modation and services	01	0-2	0-2	0-2Cuts of this order cannot be found by deferment ofnew starts. The remaining provision covers on-going new work and current expenditure. savings could only be found by prejudicing the operational efficiency of Parliamentary accommodation or defer-ring schemes regarded as essential by Parliament.The postponement of an air conditioning schemedue to start in 1980-81 would be realistic andfeasible; and would produce a saving of  0-million in that year.

The Inland Revenue&apos;s additional administrative costs in 1976-77 are for overtime arising from the1976 Finance Bill. In subsequent years they repre-sent the net increase generated mainly by growth inthe number of individual and corporate taxpayers,and of those liable to income tax at the higher and additional rates, less other savings achieved by legis-lation and administrative decision. Provision isalso required for payments under the Finance Billproposals for tax relief by deduction from lifeassurance premiums.5. The additional expenditure by Customs and excise is required for new and replacement tele-phone equipment, more uniforms because of greaterturnover of uniformed staff and capital expenditureon the replacement, which cannot be further delayed,of vessels.Policy options6.

Driver and vehicle licensing is undertaken partly by the Centre (DVLC) at Swansea, partly by thePost Office under an agency agreement and partly by Local Vehicle Licensing Offices (LVLOs). the survey figures include the administrative costs ofVehicle Excise Duty.Additional bid8. As a result of higher postal charges, and the relatively sparse distribution of LVLOs, morelicences than expected are being renewed throughthe Post Office. Since use of the Post Office underthe agency agreement is more expensive than use ofLVLOs, additional sums are required:  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80      1980-810-8 0-7 0-7 1-0These increases might be partly offset by reducingenforcement activity (which could lead to increasedevasion and consequent loss of revenue).Policy options9.

The Department^ expenditure is largely determinedby the staff required to administer savings securitiesand by contractual arrangements with the PostOffice. They have identified savings, largely by cutting publicity, of  0-1 million in 1977-78 andfollowing years. They believe that further savings would require the withdrawal of major savingssecurities. For example the withdrawal of SAYE(Index linked) would save  0-2 million in 1977-78, 0-3 million in 1978-79 and  0-5 million in 1979-80and 1980-81. Ministers have previously refused to contemplate this option and the withdrawal of other major securities because of the unacceptable con-sequences for financing the Public Sector borrowing requirement.BANK OF ENGLAND11. During 1975-76 at the request of the treasury the Bank have carried out a comprehensive reviewof the cost of those of its services which fall withinthe Survey; on its own initiative the Bank decidedto extend the review to cover all its activities. Asa result it has been possible to make a number of economies which have been incorporated in the survey figures as estimating reductions.Policy options12. The illustrative reductions would require thefollowing savings:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-8/1-2	2-4	2-4	2-4Since the greater part of this expenditure is deter-mined by the demand for bank notes, by the successof the efforts to fund the Central government borrowing requirement by the issue of government securities, and by the need for an effective exchange control, the scope for specific economies in the shortterm is limited. Within the exchange control area,the following options have been considered (but arenot recommended since they would each have an adverse effect on the balance of payments):(i) (a) Abolishing the scrutiny of companyaccounts to ensure that the overseas sub-sidiaries make the necessary remittances tothe United Kingdom (saving 21 to 24 staff).(b) Calling for a selected sample of accountse.g. from just the major companies (saving to 10 staff).(ii) Increasing the future emigration entitlement to  20,000 worldwide (saving 6 to 17 staff).(iii) Delegating authority to authorised banks todeal with all applications by United Kingdomresidents to buy property abroad, to regard allthe sale proceeds as investment currency andto authorise unlimited official exchange for maintenance (saving 16 to 22 staff).13. The possibility of further economies in the longer term is being actively pursued, e.g. the useof different paper for bank notes and the relocationof the debt management work outside London, but these cannot be offered at this stage in the form ofoptions for consideration by Ministers. Much ofthe Bank&apos;s work is subject to conditions of physicalsecurity. The capital expenditure programme is confined to projects required accordingly or designedto increase efficiency, e.g. by computerisation. Pro-jects are phased so as to ensure a smoothexpenditure profile.Central management of the Civil Service and RoyalCommissionsImplications of the Survey figures14. This expenditure covers the management func-tions of the Civil Service Department (CSD), royal commissions, Government hospitality and Parlia-mentary Counsel. Expenditure at the level above would enable existing policies to continue without serious disruption of work, although some planneddevelopments would need to be deferred orabandoned.A additional bid15. Since last year&apos;s Survey four new Royal Com-missions have been appointed (National health service. Gambling, Legal Profession (England andWales and Northern Ireland) and Legal Profession(Scotland)) and a committee was set up to review therules governing the political activities of civilservants for which no provision was made in Cmnd.6393. Additional provision is necessary in eachyear although some offsetting savings are availablein 1977-78 following the suspension of civil service pay research.16. The net effect of the additional bid for royal commissions is as follows:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	SO	-81Royal Commissions	0-8	0-6	0-1	-
In the CSD*s view it would not be possible to con-tain these net additions within the Survey figureswithout seriously slowing down the progress of royal Commissions or disrupting the CSD&apos;s workto an unacceptable degree.Policy options17. The illustrative reductions would producesavings of:  million_1977-78     1978-79     1979-80     1980-81_0-S_PO_HJ_1-0_The range of options open to the CSD is limited.The bulk of the expenditure in these programmes isin respect of salaries and wages.18. If the CSD is required to make economies of up to 8 per cent in 1978-79 as the result of thecurrent review of civil service staff costs, a reductionof  0-5 million (2  per cent) in 1977-78 would be feasible by slowing down work on the implement a-tion of Fulton and the closure of the EdinburghCentre of the Civil Service College. In 1978-79and subsequent years feasible reductions, whichsubstantially exceed the minimum levels of cutssuggested in the ground rules, are being considered in the review of staff costs.Broadcasting (capital expenditure)Implications of Survey figures19. The programme covers the capital expenditureof the BBC Home Service and the IBA. The pro-vision allows for Phase I of the Ultra HighFrequency (UHF) 625-line television transmitterbuilding programme, for the replacement of existingworn-out plant and, in the case of BBC HomeServices, for refurbishing existing studio facilities and studio development.Additional bids20. The Home Office propose additional expendi-ture as follows:  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81(i) Rearrangement   of  fre-					quency assignments	0-4	1-3	1-7	0-6	 (ii)TJHF programme Phase					II    ...	0-1	0 2	0-4	0-8	1-8(iii) Sound  broadcasting of					Parliamentary proceed-					ings ....	0-2	0-2	-	-	 (iv) Fourth television service					in Wales   .	0-1	2-3	5-3	7-3	5-9114Item (i) arises because of the proposed re-arrange-ment of low and medium frequency assignmentsfollowing the 1975 Regional Administrative Broad-casting Conference in Geneva. Changes must bemade by November 1978. The extra provision isrequired by the BBC. Item (ii) is for the construc-tion of transmitters to broadcast television pro-grammes at UHF in 625 lines and colour. Thecost and method of financing item (iii) are stiffunder discussion. The bid assumes that the BBCwill be responsible for the sound signal at the palace of Westminster but that there will be no significant capital expenditure by the IBA. Item(iv) was accepted in principle when the government announced in 1974 that priority should be givento providing a primarily Welsh language fourthtelevision service in Wales. It was announced inFebruary this year that an immediate Governmentsubvention could not be justified in present economic circumstances but that it would be kept under review as part of the public expenditurereview. The figures are subject to variation andassume a decision in late 1976 for work to startin April 1977.21. Offsetting savings could be found from withinthe broadcasting capital expenditure programmeonly by further cuts to the UHF programme; re-placements and repairs to existing transmitters andBBC studios; and further deferments to BBC studiobuildings in the regions and Wales. The HomeOffice has control only over the total capital expen-diture of the BBC Home Services and IBA and itmight well be impossible to override a refusal from either body to accommodate the new expenditure involved in these additional bids at the expense oftheir existing programme. The question of off-setting savings for the fourth television service in wales would need to be discussed between theTreasury, Home Office and the Welsh Office.Policy options22.  The illustrative options would save:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81BBC	.    0 6	1-2	1-3	1-3IBA (television)	0 1	0-2	0-1	0-1The savings would fall ofi plans to improve orrefurbish studios, build UHF TV transmitters, and repair and replace existing transmitters. The BBCsSECRET
capital programme has already been reducedbecause of a shortfall in expected licence revenue.23. The sum of the illustrative figures for reduc-tions in total Home Office services amounts to something less than 2\ per cent and 5 per centoverall. If further reductions were required, theywould have to fall on capital expenditure and itwould be for decision how far the reduction shouldbe carried on fundamental law and order servicesand what further contribution the BBC and IBAshould be asked to make by further reductions intheir capital expenditure programme.Records, registrations and surveys24. This includes expenditure by several Govern-ment Departments (the Office of population censuses and Surveys (OPCS), the General RegisterOffice (Scotland) (GRO(S)). Land Registry,Ordnance Survey, and other minor departments)and some local authority expenditure. provision is made under the OPCS for social surveys carriedout as an allied service for GovernmentDepartments.Implications of Survey figures25. The Cmnd. 6393 provision for OPCS andGRO(S) included provisional estimates of the costof preparatory work for a full population census in1981. It is now estimated that this provision willbe insufficient. For Ordnance Survey, the basefigures show a steady decrease in net expenditure.Recent forecasts indicate a fall in the sales ofOrdnance Survey maps. If this materialises it willhave the effect of slowing down the rate of reductionin net expenditure unless offsetting savings aresecured. The Public Record Office requireadditional capital provision. The provision for registration of electors in Scotland is insufficient.Additional bids26.

Reductions of 2J per cent in 1977-78 and5 per cent in following years could produce thefollowing savings:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81OPCS and GRO (S)	0 2	0 5	0-5	0-5Ordnance Survey	0-2	0-4	0-4	0-4Electoral registration	 	8.0	 	8-0Any reduction in the	allocation	for	OPCS	andGRO(S) would require a decrease in manpower.The options shown above would require staff to bereduced by 72 and 144 respectively. Given that additional manpower will be required to meet theneeds of the 1981 census and that the Civil Servicecuts required by Cmnd. 6393 have to be made, theimpkrattAa-aoa oi the options would mean that theDepartments would have to abandon or severelycurtail some of their main functions on which thepublic and Government Departments rely. ForOrdnance Survey, a reduction of 48 staff in 1977-78and 104 in later years would be required. Thiswould affect the standards of mapping and admini-strative work. The net expenditure figures of the
minor departments are relatively small and anysavings would have to be made from manpower.All these departments are being asked to offersavings in connection with the CSD manpowersavings exercise. The savings on electoral registra-tion would be achieved by revising the registerbiennially. This would require legislation. Thepresent register is reckoned to be only 85 per centaccurate at the end of its fife, and&quot; there has 6eenpressure for making it more up to date. A biennialregister would contain more inaccuracies, and becontested and there would doubtless be pressure for exceptions which would reduce the expectedsavings.DevolutionAdditional bid  million	1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-77	-78	-79	-80	-81Scotland	11	6-6	9 4	10 3	10-wales .	2-9	10-9	14-3	15-0	15-128. This is a new programme covering the netadditional costs of devolution, i.e. the additionalcosts resulting from devolution after allowing forthe reductions made possible in other public expen-diture programmes. The expenditure includes thecost of elections, the salaries of members of theAssemblies and their staff, and the cost of additional staff for the Secretaries of State, as well as expendi-ture on the Assembly buildings themselves, office accommodation and common services such as print-ing and stationery. The estimates are necessarilyextremely tentative at this stage.20. The estimates provided by the Welsh Officeassume a net build-up of staff to 2.100 (3,722 less1,622 from manpower savings in Whitehall depart-ments). This is an increase on the very roughestimate in the White Paper on &quot; Our ChangingDemocracy: Devolution to Scotland and Wales&quot;(Cmnd. 6348), which suggested that an additional1,600 staff would be required, not allowing for possible savings is other departments. The man-power estimates for Scotland are in line with thosein Cmnd. 6348.30. The Welsh Office consider that if the scottish assembly comes into existence on I April 1978,there will be very strong pressure for the welsh assembly to come into being on the same date.But. this timetable would cause very considerablestaffing problems for the Welsh. If the welsh assembly did not come into existence until 1 April1979, this would lead to the following reductions in expenditure:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-812-6	7-4	40	0-9	0 131.

Provision of  2 million a year is includedin the Survey but actual requirements may varyabove or below this figure in any particular year.The option would imply a change from what has previously been regarded as a contingency provision,to an absolute ceiling from 1977-78. This couldmean that in some years the Government might notbe able to meet its obligation to the AMC to provide sufficient financial backing to enable the Corpora-tion to issue its debentures and this in turn couldmean a restriction in the amount of money availablefor lending to farmers.  The Agricultural Depart-ments consider that this would be against the spiritif not the letter of the Agricultural Credits Act 1928and subsequent legislation, and that it would be undesirable to curtail the supply of funds to theIndustry particularly at a time when the Governmentis anxious to encourage investment in agriculture.34. This heading also covers the capital investment programme of Cable and Wireless Ltd. which is discussed in the separate report to Ministers on nationalised industry investment.

Expenditure on this sub-programme is mainlydetermined by the area of office space required forthe Home Civil Service. The size of this pro-gramme will be influenced by the CSD manpowerexercise: in particular, the size of the reductions in staff numbers and where they are to occur. Muchwill depend on how far and how quickly space canbe re-allocated to produce surplus holdings of a sizethat can be offered on the market, and also on thestate of the property market. The interim assump-tion, reflected in the forecasts for rent and for officespace is that after 1976-77 the total number ofnon-industrial civil servants will fall by some30.000.2.

If these staff increases takeplace additional provision will be required asfollows:  million1976	1977	1978	1979	1980-77	-78	-79	-80	-8110,000 extra staff .    -	2-5	5-0	5-0	5 05. Any savings needed to be found from this pro-gramme to cover the increased costs would have tobe at the expense of the policy options. Provisionfor the extra staff in Edinburgh and Cardiff as aresult of devolution is proposed in Programme 13.6. The 1975 Survey figures made no provision forthe level of staff now planned and agreed by theCSD as part of the 1975 manpower forecast for1 April 1977. Alignment with the 1975 manpowerforecast requires additional expenditure as follows:  million7977-75   1978-79  1979-80Adjustment of rents to agree with1975 manpower forecast      .      5-7 4-2 0-7This expenditure is required to accommodate agreedmanpower totals any savings to cover it would onlybe available at the expense of the policy options.Policy options7. Illustrative options up to the percentages pro-posed in the ground rules would not be feasible onthe rent bill as commitments have to be met; the saving indicated would involve cutting back onschemes for rehousing staff. Further cuts on depart-mental administration beyond those which may berequired under the manpower exercise would not be feasible. This means that disproportionately largecuts would have to fall on capital expenditure(10 per cent in later years) and to a lesser extent on maintenance and running costs (6 per cent in later years). The figures are as follows:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Capital:				New Works	2-4	7-2	6-8	6 6Furniture and Equip-				ment .	1-0	2-0	2 0	2*0Rent	0-5	0-5	0-5	0-5Maintenance and Run-				ning costs	3 4	4-6	4-6	4-6	7-3	14*3	13-9	13-78. On the basis that cuts in the content and timing of the dispersal and office improvement programmes are avoided, the reduction on new works wouldinvolve:(a) deferring a number of new building projects to rehouse regional offices of departments in the interests of efficiency or improvedworking environment, where there is not already an unavoidable commitment; and(b) cutting the provision for minor adaptationschemes. However, if additional and urgentschemes not at present foreseen were to berequired by departments, then it would benecessary either to allocate further funds orto make reductions in other high priority new works programmes which might have toinclude office improvement or dispersalschemes.9. The savings on furniture would have to beachieved by cutting back on replacement and modernisation programmes. The reductions on maintenance and running costs would have to besought through fjel saving as far as possible, andby lowering standards of maintenance below what has hitherto been regarded as the minimum essential.Stationery and printing (home)10. Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office suppliesGovernment departments with their printing,stationery and office machinery, and is responsiblefor the printing and in most cases the publication,distribution, and sale of Government publications.Although HMSO tries to meet departments&apos; requests for stationery and printing economically, in the mainit cannot reject or reduce them.Additional bids11. HMSO have made bids for additional expendi-ture in respect of the publications main distribution
centre; a new central warehouse; and the Parlia-mentary Press. The Treasury and the CSD have asked for offsetting savings, but none have so far been identified.   The amounts involved are:  million1976-77      1977-78      1978-79      1979-80      1980-810 4 1-3 2-6 4-1 3-5The figures do not take account of the expectation that within the Survey period HMSO operations willbe put on a trading fund basis.Policy options12. The illustrative options would mean reductions of  2-3 million in 1977-78 and  4-7 million in thefollowing years. Such reductions would be likely to lead to interruptions of supply unless there werecorresponding reductions in departments&apos; require-ments.Computers and telecommunicationsImplications of Survey figures13. The expenditure reductions shown in Cmnd.6393 have meant the cancellation or deferment ofa number of projects designed to achieve economies in departmental operations and to improve efficiency. Further action will be required during1976 to ensure that the announced reductions are achieved in 1978-79 and subsequent years. Thiswill involve extending the life of existing equipmentwhere possible, hiring some new equipment ratherthan purchasing it and cancelling some new pro-jects. However, it is impossible at this stage to identify particular schemes that would be affected.For telecommunications, the Cmnd. 6393 figures would mean that the Central Computer Agency(CCA) could not provide various types of com-munications facilities which are required for efficientwork by dispersed staff, and which are covered bythe additional bids. Provision has not been madefor the procurement of such items as sharedexchanges, which will largely be met by the transferof funds from other programmes.Additional bids14.  million	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Computers	0 1	0-8	0-2Telecommun icatio ns	0-4	0-1	 Total	0-5	0-9	0 2The additions are required for essential dispersalneeds. Given that the basic programme is inade-quate to meet existing requirements, compensatingsavings could be found only by cutting out schemesof equal or greater priority than those covered by theadditional bids. For telecommunications, the additions (together with the sums to be transferred from other programmes) represent the sums requiredto enable CCA to carry out its agreed function of purchasing telecommunications equipment which isessential for existing policy requirements. Thepresent programme is in the Department^ view too small to enable new requirements to be met bysavings.Policy options15.  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Cancellations and deferments				of computer and telecommunications-				munications projects	1-0	1-9	1*9	1-916.   The main burden	of cuts	must	fall on	thepurchase of equipment. Any option which involved the cancellation or deferment of projects would further adversely affect the functioning of Govern-ment computing, especially in the later years of the survey. Hiring of equipment rather than purchasingwould be necessary. Over the Survey period thiswould be more costly, and would increase thedifficulty of keeping within limits in subsequent years.17. For telecommunications, from 1978-79 onwardsthere would be insufficient money available to cover the acquisition of shared telephone exchanges.Proposals including the purchase of shared exchanges,and the extension of the remote meeting tablenetwork, would have to be deferred indefinitely.Home publicity18. This covers expenditure on publicity campaignswhich are carried out by the Central Office ofInformation and Scottish Office for other Govern-ment departments and includes the related printingcosts on HMSO&apos;s Vote. Publicity is directedprincipally at audiences in the United Kingdomthrough the media of press antTtelevision advertising,films, exhibitions and publications in support of departmental policies.   The Survey base figures
imply economies in the publicity programmes for all departments including the major continuingcampaigns.Policy options19. The illustrative options would mean savings of 0-4 million in 1977-78 and  0-8 million in sub-sequent years. It is not possible to say at this stagewhich Departmental publicity campaigns would beaffected.Civil superannuationImplications of Survey figures20. This programme covers expenditure on thepensions, lump sum benefits and other superannu-ation benefits (including transfer payments to other schemes) payable to civil servants and their dependants, offset by contributions payable by certain funds and organisations, by civil servantstowards the cost of widows&apos; pensions, transfer payments received from other schemes and certain other receipts. The 1976-77 estimate includes a payment of  25 million to the Civil aviation authority (CAA), to be added to the  40 millionpaid in 1975-76, in respect of the accrued pension rights of 6,500 civil servants transferred to the CAAat the beginning of 1975.21. No provision has been made for improvements in the benefits of the scheme. Nor do the forecaststake into account increased numbers of pensions andother superannuation awards that may arise fromaccelerated retirements or redundancies resultingfrom the decisions that may be taken to implement the savings in Civil Service manpower announced in cmnd. 6393. Ignoring the special payment of 25 million in 1976-77, the forecasts show increases of about 9 per cent a year in net expenditure,reflecting the cumulative effect of the increase in thenumber of payments.Additional bids22. The additional bids result solely from revisionsof the estimates of the net costs of paying benefits inaccordance with the rules of the scheme.  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	-78	-79	-80	-81Revision   to  estimates  of				superannuation payments	2-2	0-7	-0-1	 Policy options23.

In a programme where expenditure is directly related to the numbers of people eligible to receivebenefits under existing provisions, reductions of this order are not a feasible proposition. Even if it werepractical to reduce the benefits of the scheme, the reductions could apply only to those who retired infuture and the bulk of the expenditure arises fromthe payment of benefits to people who have alreadyretired or who will have a reserved right to theexisting benefits of the scheme.Other common services25. This programme covers the cost of legalservices, the Government Actuary and Civil ServiceCatering Services.Additional bid26. The Cmnd. 6393 provision for the TreasurySolicitors Office would not allow existing policies tobe maintained. This would require an additionalbid as follows:  million1977-78     1978-79     1979-80     1980-810-3 0*4 0-3 0-3Policy options27.

Table 15 shows the division of Northern Irelandexpenditure between Northern Ireland departments and United Kingdom departments. It does not include (i) the cost of food subsidies and price guarantees for milk and wool which appear for theUnited Kingdom as a whole in Table 3 (NorthernIreland&apos;s share of this in 1976-77 is about  20million reducing to  3 million by 1979-80); (ii)expenditure by the Intervention Board for Agri-cultural Produce on market regulation operations to implement the Common Agricultural Policy in theUnited Kingdom as a whole (also in Table 3); and(iii) extra costs attributable to the Army&apos;s task inNorthern Ireland, which are included within thefigures in Table 1 and are likely to be about  59million in 1976-77.Implications of Survey figures2. The expenditure figures m the above Table arethose contained in the White Paper on public expenditure (Cmnd. 6393), adjusted to allow for
the unemployment relief measures announced inFebruary 1976; changes announced at the time ofthe Budget; additional expenditure in respect ofadministration of social security and industrial training; additions in 1976-77 following the deci-sions announced in connection with the new paypolicy agreed with the TUC to defer increases in thecharge for school meals and to provide additionaltraining services; and some small downward esti-mating changes. Basically they represent little change in the level of expenditure envisaged in cmnd. 6393 and, in the main, provide for a con-continuation of services at the standard envisaged inthat White Paper. Emphasis continues to be placedon employment, on the maintenance of law andorder, and on those programmes of social signi-significance such as education, and health, andparticularly on housing where there is the greatest need to remedy deficiencies and improve standards.In education, existing levels of expenditure arebeing maintained, while the health and housing programmes show some growth. On housing, pro-vision is made for maintaining the building programme of new houses at a level marginallyabove that of the previous five years, and for an extensive programme of urgently needed repairs and improvements to existing houses. The neteffect should be an increase in the number of homesprovided with a high degree of flexibility in themeans used to achieve this end.3. The detailed allocation of funds within thetrade, industry and employment programme may beaffected by an urgent review of economic andindustrial strategy which is currently taking place,against a background of over 51,000 unemployedi.e. 9-9 per cent of the labour force with furtherclosures pending. The review is aimed at ensuring that the best use is made of the limited resources available. Other current policy reviews. e.g. onareas of special social need, may result in somereallocation between several social programmes.Additional bids4.

Item 1 relates to agricultural services provided to northern Ireland by the United KingdomMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food and covers both those governed by statuteand others required to maintain existingUnited Kingdom administered agriculturepolicies.  2-8 million in 1976-77 reflectsdelayed payments of e.c. compensatoryallowances for less-favoured areas.Item 2 (i) is for the continuation of the existingSecurity Guards Grant scheme. This isexpenditure which it is reasonable to reviewyear by year, since it depends upon thesecurity situation. In present circumstances it is not possible to think of discontinuingthe Security Guards Grant scheme in1977-78. Enterprise Ulster provides work with a training and rehabilitation element.The token expenditure under item 2 (ii) is needed to provide its statutory board withan assurance that it will remain in existencethroughout the Survey period. Existing pro-vision ends in 1978-79. The new development Agency, item 2 (iii), is theNorthern Ireland counterpart of the national enterprise Board and the Scottish and WelshDevelopment Agencies, and will requirefinance for its activities as they develop. Ithas recently replaced the former NorthernIreland Finance Corporation for which, as ithad only a limited statutory life, no provisionhad been made beyond 1978-79, and only very limited provision in that year.The additional bid in respect of Regional Employ-ment Premium, item 2 (iv), relates to thesuggestion by the United Kingdom Depart-ment of Employment, recorded under GBProgramme 4, that the women&apos;s rate beincreased to equal the men&apos;s, and is contin-gent upon a decision on GB Programme 4.The additional bid against school meals, item 3,reflects the suggestion under GB Programme10 that the planned increases in school mealscharges from September 1977 may have tobe implemented one year in arrear.The object of the expenditure against item 4 is tocontinue the process of making the policemore effective in securing the conviction ofterrorists through the courts and thus in due course making it possible for the involvementof the Army in Northern Ireland to bereduced as is provided for in MOD plans and reflected in the Defence Budget figures.The aim is also to achieve a more cost-effective system.Item 5 shows the changes resulting from the revised economic assumptions. It reflectssimilar changes on account of these in GBprogrammes 12, 4 and 7.Offsetting savings5. The additional bids in respect of agricultureservices, item 1, would be offset in the same way asthe corresponding United Kingdom additional bidsunder Programme 3.6. In order to offset the additional bids at items 2(i), (ii) and (iii) above by the Northern IrelandDepartments, the factory building programme wouldhave to be reduced by about one-sixth; the newCentral Bus Station planned for Belfast deferredto beyond the Survey period, and administrative economies made in agricultural and miscellaneouscommon services. Item 2 (iv), as stated above, iscontingent on the decision taken in GB. Item 3 issimilarly contingent on GB decisions.7. To produce offsets to meet item 4 a reductionof  10 million on electricity, involving cuts in expenditure on distribution, transmission andgeneration, and on office accommodation wouldhave to be made. Industrial development expendi-ture would have to be reduced, possibly by cuttingthe factory building programme further to a levelof only  10 million a year and by curtailing theprovision for grants and loans for industrial develop-ment. Reductions of  10 million and  7 million would have to be made in the Housing and Roadsprogrammes respectively. Further administrative economies would have to be made and a numberof new works contracts deferred.8. The net effect of the changes under item 5 (i),(ii) and (iii) is a reduction in expenditure.Policy options9. A list of illustrative options to meet the target of reducing expenditure by 2\ per cent in 1977-78and 5 per cent thereafter is set out below. Ifdecisions to reduce expenditure were taken, changesmight need to be made to this list in the fight ofoptions taken up in Great Britain in respect of comparable services.

The effect of the Northern Ireland Depart-ments&apos; options bears most heavily on the pro-grammes for trade, industry and employment; roads and transport; housing; education and libraries,science and arts; and health and personal social services. Some of these programmes have alreadysustained heavy cuts under the 1975 Survey. If theoffsetting savings described in paragraphs 5 and 6were taken in full and the listed options were adopted in full, the ensuing reduction of the pro-vision for the trade, industry and employment pro-gramme could gravely inhibit the Governmentsability to make an impression on the economic problems facing Northern Ireland. Little new construction work would be undertaken on roadswhile maintenance standards would be adversely affected.The resultant capital programme for schoolswould barely provide classrooms to meet changesin the school population and there would be noscope for badly needed school improvements. no new capital projects would be carried out for health and personal social services before 1980-81.Against the background of Northern Ireland&apos;sserious housing problem, a reduction in the building programme which left spare capacity in the con-struction industry would be feasible, but difficultto defend. There would be 3 severe slowing down of drainage, forestry and fishery programmes andrestriction of work on the advisory, education andinspectorate aspects of agriculture. Other services such as water and sewerage, industrial training andsport and recreation would also be curtailed.Further administrative economies would be made and new works deferred.Social Security is a service in which exact parityis maintained with Great Britain, so that anyoptions which were adopted there would also beapplied to Northern Ireland and the NorthernIreland totals would nave to be adjusted accordingly.In the meantime savings from reductions of 2J percent and 5 per cent are shown for the relevantyears without being attributed to specific changes.11. Although the full effects on employment ifthe options were taken up were still being assessedwhen this Report was printed it was already clearthat the reductions would have serious con-sequences- In manufacturing industry the massivereductions in the trade, industry and employmentprovision would affect Northern Ireland&apos;s ability to maintain or promote employment. The con-struction and associated industries would be severely affected by cuts in the capital programmes. Therewould also be reduced employment opportunities for those undergoing training in technical and professional employment e.g. in health and education.12.

1. Table A brings together for England and wales and for Scotland the figures for local authoritycurrent expenditure in PES terms from the indi-vidual programme tables in Part 2 and shows the adjustments which are necessary to move from current expenditure on the PES basis to relevant expenditure as defined for rate support grant pur-poses. These adjustments are shown separately bymain programme in Tables B and C.2. The Public Expenditure White Paper published in February 1976 (Cmnd. 6393) made it dear that no increase in the total of local authority current expenditure could be afforded over the next fewyears; and that any increases in individual services,whether for demographic or other reasons, must be offset by reduced levels of provision in other ser-vices. The rate support grant settlements for1976-77 which were announced in November 1975were made on this basis; and the aggregate figures in Table A accordingly show a picture of broadstability for the future years of the Survey period,with modest falls in total current expenditure in bothEngland and Wales and in Scotland in 1977-78 and1978-79.3. The figures for 1974-75 are near-final outturnfigures submitted by the local authorities. For1975-76 the estimates for England and Wales are largely based on information about spending inten-tions which was available when the rate support grant settlement was made last Autumn. The figuresfor individual programmes do not take account ofinformation recently received from the new DOE/CIPFA enquiry into provisional outturn figures for1975-76 and budget estimates for 1976-77. Thesesuggest that current expenditure in England andWales in  975-76 is likely to be about  150 million higher than expected last Autumn, and this figure is included in the totals in Table A. A similaraddition of  55 million is made to the totals forScotland. For the current year, the figures imply that the local authorities will keep their expenditure to the rate support grant level: the implications of the information from the new returns mentionedabove which suggested that local authority spendingplans may exceed the White Paper figures by about 400 million in England and Wales, and informationsuggesting the possibility of a similar  40 millionexcess in Scotland, and the action which has beentaken to cut back these plans is discussed in annex E to Part 1 of this Report.--*------4. The projections of local authority current ex-penditure for the later years of the PESC periodhave been prepared by departments in the light ofthe ground rules for the 1976 Survey. The implications-tions for the main local authority services of holdingexpenditure to these levels are described in theprogramme chapters of Part 2. A summary of bidsfor additional local authority expenditure submittedby Departments is given in Special Analysis 3,Table F.5. Following discussions in the consultative council on Local Government Finance, arrange-ments have been made this year to involve the localauthorities more fully in the PESC process. Tothis end, groups of Central Government and localauthority officials have been set up to examine the implications for local authority services of theCmnd. 6393 figures in the future years of the PESCperiod, and to consider the balance between current and capital programmes, particularly in the yearsafter 1977-78. Additionally, to facilitate discussion in the Consultative Council of priorities between ser-vices, the official groups will also consider thepossible application of illustrative cuts of 2J percent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent in 1978-79 and1979-80 to local authority programmes. The resultsof this work, both for 1977-78 and for later years,will be discussed by the Consultative Council inJuly.Current and relevant expenditure6. The differences in definition between current expenditure in PES terms and relevant expenditureranking for payment of rate support grant give riseto continuing problems of communication between central Government and the local authorities, par-ticularly in regard to the appropriate definition ofexpenditure for control purposes. Some progress has been made in this area in the last year: thevarious definitions of expenditure have been dis-cussed with the local authorities and, when thePublic Expenditure White Paper was published inFebruary, the members of the Consultative council were provided with a table showing the Cmnd. 6393figures expressed in terms of current expenditureranking for rate support grant and total relevant expenditure. A table of Jhis kind, with figuresrevalued to November 1975 prices (the price base of the 1976-77 rate support grant settlement) hasrecently been circulated to local authorities, omitting
rISECRETSpecial Analysis 1estimates of loan charges and total relevant expendi-ture for the years after 1976-77. The most helpfulpresentation of loan charges in future years remainsa particular problem. The real burden of loan charges is not subject to the same degree of control by local authorities as is the volume of current expenditure and will depend primarily on theinteraction between future interest rates and the rateof inflation, both of which are very uncertain over a five-year period, and to a much smaller extent on changes in the level of capital expenditure and in theproportion of outstanding debt which needsrefinancing.    The estimates of relevant expenditurein this Special Analysis are again based on theneutral convention that the real burden of loan charges will remain constant at its 1976-77 level.7. The rates of growth of current and relevant expenditure implied by the estimates in this SpecialAnalysis are shown in the table below. the differences between the definition of current expendi-ture for PES and RSG purposes are explained in thefootnotes to Tables B and C. The most significantof these are in education and housing and relate to expenditure by local authorities reimbursed by central Government which is excluded from current expenditure ranking for RSG.Per cent per centAnnual rales of growthAnnual rales of growth	1975	1976	1977	1978  1979	1980		1975 1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	-76	-77	-78	-79    -80	-81		-76    -77	-78	-79	-80	-81England and Wales						Scotland					Total current ex-						Total current ex-					penditure						penditure					(PES basis)	4-6*4	-1-8	-0-4	-0-6 4-0-5	4-0-2	(PES basis)   .	4-10-7 -1-4	-0-8	-1-3		-0-5Current expendi-						Current expend!-					ture    ranking						ture   relevant					for RSG (j.e.						for RSG (/.*.					excluding loan						excluding loan					charges    and						charges    and					capital     met						capital     met					from revenue)	4-6-2	-2-3	-0-9	-0-8 +0-3	4-0-1	from revenue)	4-12-0 -1-6	-1-5	-0-3	-0 2	-0-6Total     relevant						Total    relevant					expenditure ex-						expenditure ex-					cluding    loan						cluding    loan					charges .	4-7-4	-2-1	-11	-1-1 +0-3	4-0-1	charges .	+ 11-8 -1-6	-1-5	-0-3	-0-2	-0-6Total     relevant						Total    relevant					expenditure						expenditure					(RSG basis)  .	4-6-7	-0-6	-1-0	-1-0 +0-3	+0 1	(RSG basis) .	4-10-2 4-0-2	-1-3	-0-2	-0-2	-0-5

The financing of relevant expenditure. Table D shows that relevant expenditure inGreat Britain has risen from  4,622 million in1971-72 to an estimated  12,492 million in1976-77 a very rapid rate of growth which reflectsboth the expansion of local authority spending in volume terms and the high rate of inflation. Overthe same period rates have more than doubled from 2,135 million to  4,601 million. Aggregateexchequer grants, however, have more than trebledin the same period from  2,672 million to 8,272 million. The table below shows aggregateexchequer grants as a percentage of the approvedlevel of relevant expenditure for the years coveredby the table:England ScotlandandWales1971-72 571 661972-73 58 66J1973-74 60 681974-75 601C+ special provision     68 ^ special provision- 651) = 71)1975-76 66J 751976-77 65J 749. For 1971-72 to 1975-76 the estimates ofexpenditure in Table D have been obtained fromreturns made by departments and the estimates ofrates and of exchequer grants from publishedsources and estimates by DOE In principle, the differences between expenditure and income shouldreflect changes in local authority balances but thefigures shown in the table appear to reflect also asmall difference between relevant and rate fundexpenditure and some discrepancies between the sources of the various estimates.10. In 1976-77 the amount of additional rate sup-port grant and supplementary grants payable inrespect of pay and price increases is subject to a cash limit. The estimates of expenditure for theyear are the figures shown in Table A, revalued to1976-77 outturn prices using the assumptions aboutinflation underlying the cash limit, and assuming that the additional amount payable in respect ofloan charges and specific grant which are excludedfrom the cash limit will conform to the estimatesmade when the cash limits were announced. Therates forecast is based on local authority rate calls for 1976-77 which represented an average rise ofabout 8 per cent in England and Wales and little change in Scotland (after allowing for the shorterfinancial year in 1975-76). The excess of incomeover expenditure of  388 million shown for Englandand Wales (and  65 million for Scotland) will ofcourse be reduced if inflation proves to be higherthan assumed for the purpose of setting the cashlimit or if local authorities spend more than allowed for in the tables above (see paragraph 3 above).

Table E shows a decline in local authoritycapital expenditure in Great Britain from 1974-75to a level in 1980-81 substantially lower than at thebeginning of the previous decade. Because of theconsequences of capital projects for recurrent expenditure (on both loan charges and runningexpenses), the importance of which is beingincreasingly recognised, the fall in capital pro-grammes is a necessary Accompaniment to the stability in current expenditure shown in Table A.12. In England and Wales total provision fallsfrom  4,497 million in 1974-75 to  2,774 million
SECRETSpecial Anahnns in 1980-81, a fall of 38 per cent. The only sub-stantial programme not showing a fall over thisperiod is key sector expenditure on Other environ-mental services; this is due to the effect of the newprovision for the Community Land Scheme in the later years. In Scotland total provision falls from 625 million in 1973-74 to  472 million in 1980-81.a drop of 24 per cent.13. In England and Wales a distinction is made between key sector services such as housing and school building which are subject to specific depart-mental approval and the locally determined sectorwithin which local authorities are free to set theirown priorities. For the latter sector, the programmeshares in future years are based on departmentalestimates and can be no more than a guide.

The bids do not in general result from proposalsfor new policies. Some of the bids are made in recognition (hat local authority expenditure on par-ticular items is virtually certain in practice to beabove the Cmnd. 6393 provision, because the conse-quences of cutting back to keep within that pro-vision are likely to be regarded as unacceptableby local authorities, even if not to Ministers.  In
this category comes some expenditure on concession-ary fare schemes, refuse collection and recreationunder Other environmental services, the increased cost of salary drift in the education services, andexpenditure on personal social services to maintainexisting standards of services for the elderly andchildren in care. These three items alone amountto over  50 million in 1978-79. If these bids are tobe accepted then compensating savings will have tobe found from among the options discussed in theindividual programme sections of this Report ifaggregate expenditure is to be kept to the Cmnd.6393 level.3. Other bids cover expenditure, required to main-tain existing standards or policies, which could be prevented if Ministers were to accept policy changes and issue specific guidance to local authorities, un-palatable though such action would be.   In this category are police salaries to cover improvedrecruitment, additional expenditure related to thedecision to defer the increased charge for school meals, and expenditure on housing. The main elements of the relatively large housing figures inTable F are capital expenditure on new dwellings(not at present controlled); and increased current expenditure (which was not fully taken into account in the figures in Cmnd. 6393) on rate fund contri-bulioas to housing revenue accounts, and rent rebates and allowances consistent with a rent policyof 10 per cent real growth annually. The negativefigures for Scotland reflect reductions in subsidies.Much of the additional bids total falls into this category. If these bids are to be accepted, and thishas to be considered in the light of Annex C to part 1 of this Report, then again compensatingsavings will have to be found elsewhere if expendi-ture in total is to be kept to the Cmnd. 6393 level.

The manpower figures in Table G are in full-time equivalent terms, and take account of part-time employees who make up about one third oftotal local authority employment in Great Britain of3 million. The figures shown include employees in local authorities&apos; revenue producing undertakings,e.g. housing and passenger transport, as well asthose in rate fund services. The estimates for indi-vidual services are based on departmental returnsexcept those for roads and transport and housing in England and Wales where estimates have beenmade by the Treasury.2. The figures relate to the base line figures in the survey Report, and therefore do not take anyaccount of additional bids for expenditure or reduc-tions which might be achieved by the adoption of lower expenditure options. The figures show localauthority employment reverting in 1981 to the 1976level with higher totals for the intervening years.Small planned increases over the period in police and personal social services are offset by 1981 by reductions in other services. The decline in educa-tion manpower after 1979 reflects demographictrends.3. Local authority staffing in England and wales has been monitored since the middle of 1975 bythe Government and the local authority associationsthrough the Joint Manpower Watch Group reporting
to the Consultative Council on Local government finance. A watch on staff numbers in Scotlandsimilar to the Joint Manpower Watch in Englandand Wales has recently been instituted in consulta-tioa with the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities. The December 1975 Joint ManpowerWatch return for England and Wales gave a full-time equivalent total of 2,086,000 employees, whichis reasonably in line with the 1 April 1976 figure of2,060,000 shown in Table G for England and Wales.4.

Special Aoarysii 6SECRET6.  The construction industryConstruction and the associated building materialindustries have a weight of over 17 per cent in theindex of industrial production. Within constructionitself public sector clients account for some 45 percent of building and 85-90 per cent of civil engineering output.2. The surge of demand in the early 1970&apos;s whichwas accompanied by steep rises in tender prices forsome types of building work, has been followed byan exceptionally sharp and prolonged fall in demand.Output in 1974 was 8 per cent lower than its 1973peak level, the greatest fall of the post-war period.In 1975 output fell by a further 5j per cent. Therates of increase in the building tender prices slowed down at the beginning of 1974, and during that yearand 1975 they averaged 2 per cent per quarter for local authority housing and less for other building.With material and labour costs increasing atquarterly rates of 4 and 5 per cent respectively, con-tractors&apos; margins were under increasing pressure.Recent conditions3. Public Works orders in 1975 were 5 per cent above 1974 but 17 per cent below 1973, the yearwhen orders were already beginning to decline (down15 per cent) from the high 1971 and 1972 levels.Private industrial and private commercial orders fellaway sharply in 1974 and in 1975; by the fourthquarter of 1975 orders from these sectors wererespectively only 35 per cent and 48 per cent of theaverage quarterly levels in the peak year of 1973, andthere was little sign of a revival of orders at thebeginning of 1976. Public housing orders recoveredduring 1974 and also during 1975. Private housingorders were down to half their 1973 levels in 1974,but they have been recovering since early 1975.4. This lower level of new orders in constructionhas had its effect on the level of work outstandingand consequently output. In the second half of 1975,output was 15 per cent below the 1973 peak, and work outstanding was about one third lower than in mid-1973. Public housing was the only sector toshow an increase in new work output io 1975 (9\ percent above 1974). Output of the main buildingmaterial industries (bricks, cement, etc) fell by 13 perCent in 1974 from the peak year 1973, and by afurther 8 per cent in 1975. Production continues ata low level; for example a recent survey of brickproducers indicated that brick production at the endof 1975 was still only at 70 per cent of capacity.Stocks of bricks have fallen in 1975 from theunusually high levels of 1974.5. Total employment in construction (includingestimates for labour only subcontractors) peaked at,934,000 in Q. 1973. Unemployment grew steadilyduring 1974. The rate of increase of registeredunemployment of adult male construction workersslowed from 10,000 per month from March to July1975 to 1,000 per month between December 1975and April 1976. The figure for that month of197,000 represents 12^ per cent of the total workforce in construction (including the unemployed);it is the highest unemployment rate for any majorindustry and compares with a rate of 5j per cent forall industries. Since the October 1973 peak ofemployment there has been a fall of about 110,000employees in employment and an estimated decreaseof 120,000 self employed operators in constructionalone, apart from any fall in employment in building materials.6. Tender prices had increased in 1972 and 1973 ataverage annual rates of about 30 per cent for bothPSA building contracts and for local authorityhousebuilding, but in 1974 both indices rose byannual rates of about 15 per cent, the former indexlevelling off, the latter rising more slowly. when these indices are adjusted for project VOP payments the rise in 1974 was less than 10 per cent. AlthoughLA housebuilding prices (VOP adjusted) have againrisen by almost 10 per cent in 1975, provisionalfourth quarter estimates for other building sectors(PSA and the Building Cost Information ServicedIndex) show tender prices to be almost the same as ayear earlier. By contrast in the first quarter of 1976material prices and earnings were both 17 per cent higher than a year previously so that the impliedmargin of tender prices over building costs feii to a level more consistent with the long term averagemark up. The only available price index for civil engineering contracts is for roads which rose much less steeply than the two building indices in 1972and 1973; the roads index increased sharply in 1974,but slowed in 1975 showing provisionally 223 in Q31975.
Prospects for the construction industry(a) Output7. The following tables show the latest forecasts of output in the construction industry, 1976-77 1980-81 by sector (building and civil engineering)and types of purchases. For sectors other thanhousing, the public sector forecasts are based onfigures in the Programme Tables shown in thisreport, and the private sector forecasts are related to two interpretations of the latest Medium TermAssessment (MTA). The interpretation giving thehigher rates of growth (see Table 1) assumes little change in the proportion of investment going to new buildings and works, while the lower pathresults from buildings and work receiving a smallershare of investment. The chart shows quarterlymovements for both paths of output over the period from 1970-1980 for building, civil engineering and total output.8. Given the planned 1976-77 expenditure pro-gramme the volume of new orders from the publicworks sector is expected to stabilise in 1976 at about their present level, and 1975-76 output is expectedto show no change on 1974-75. Thereafter orders and correspondingly output will fall steadily withoutput at a level in 1980-81 some 25 per cent below1971-72, a peak output year for this sector. It ispossible that local authorities&apos; desire to avoidrenewed sharp increases in rates could involvebuilding expenditure programmes being pruned tobelow the amounts implied by the survey.9. Housing output is expected to increase by8J per cent in 1976-77, but to show marginaldecreases in 1977-78 and 1978-79. Thereafterdespite a falling trend for public housing, totalhousing output is forecast to gently rise. Totalhousing repairs and maintenance including housingimprovements is forecast to maintain a steady growththroughout the period.10. With the very steep recovery for investment inthe private manufacturing and distribution sectorsforecast by the MTA, the new buildings and workselement is not expected initially to maintain its pastshare of the total, mainly because the quantity ofempty office and factory space may dampen demandfor new building. But in order to sustain the&quot;ivestment recovery, both private industrial building^d private commercial building output would need to grow from the very low levels forecast for 1976at rates never continuously experienced in the past.For the combined building sector, average rates ofover 10 per cent a year must occur for the three year period, 1977-78-1979-80 (see Table 1), and thevalue of new orders begin to increase sharply during1976.11. Using the somewhat lower interpretation ofthe MTA assumptions, assuming a further drop inthe share of investment for buildings and works, thegrowth in 1977-78 and 1978-79 of private non-housing building would be expected to be at aboutthe past maximum rates over a 24 month period(9 per cent a year) (see Table 2). The rate of growthis forecast to slow significantly in 1979-80, and bythe end of the period building output in this sector is some 6-8 per cent lower than on the higherassumptions.12. The movement in civil engineering output from north Sea platforms depends upon the timing oforders for these concrete and steel structures, andalso the extent to which technological changeobviates their need. Recent indications are thatthere will be not more than one order in 1976, but1977 should see an increase in orders leading tooutput in 1978-79 returning to the 1974-75 levels.13. By the end of the decade total output in theprivate non-housing sectors on the higher MTAinterpretation is forecast to be running at about1973-74 levels and some 1&amp; pet cent above 1975-76.With the assumption of lower growth rates, output for this sector is expected to be 7 per cent belowthe peak in 1973-74. 10 per cent above 1975-76.14. Non-housing repairs and maintenance isexpected to increase from 1976-77 onwards by 2 percent a year reflecting a stronger govenment policyin some sectors towards rehabilitation and thegeneral recovery in the private sector.15. The ouUook for total construction output is to steady but slow recovery over the period from1976-77 but with the emphasis for growth coming from the private sector. The average growth for thenext five years on the higher path would be I - 3 percent a year, somewhat below past trend rates andfrom a relatively low base. On the lower forecast the annual growth is I - 0 per cent Within both totalprofiles building and civil engineering movementsdiffer. Building output is expected to recover fromits 1975-76 low and grow steadily throughout theperiod giving 1980-81 either 10 per cent or 8 per cent above 1975-76. Civil engineering output is expected
numbers of skilled manpower, through losses to otherindustries and a lack of a sufficient supply of appren-tices, especially if general industrial activity recoversearlier than construction. The industry have argued that there is likely to be a shortage of land for private housing towards the end of the decade.Snmmary of prospects17. It seems as if the trough of the construction industry recession may now have been reached, withoutput 15 per cent below the peak level in 1973. a quarter of a million jobs have been lost since 1973 inthe construction and associated building materialsindustries, and with only a very slow rate of recovery in output in 1976, associated with a similarly slowrecovery in output per man from present low levels,a further 25,000 jobs are likely to be lost during1976-77. This would result in an unemploymenttotal in construction alone of about 210,000. even under the more optimistic assumption output isprojected to continue to increase only slowly,reaching in 1979-80 a level 6^ per cent above1975-76 but still 6 per cent below 1972-73, and justbelow the level of the late Sixties.to fall each year from 1975-76 and by 1980-81to be 6 per cent below that year in total. The over-all index for the higher forecast of total constructionoutput in 1979-80 is 99-6 (1970 ^ 100) which wouldbe 6\ per cent above 1975-76 but still 6 per centbelow 1972-73. In 1980-81 the index remainssteady at 99-6. For the lower forecast the indexvalues in 1979-80 and 1980-81 are 97 9 and 98-3respectively.(o) Capacity and possible constraints on futureexpansion16. There are unlikely to be major capacityconstraints or supply problems during the period under review jf output in the construction industryfollows either of the forecast paths. There is stillconsiderable spare capacity in the bricks and cementindustries since closures in the last two years havemostly been of very small units. None the less duringthe current slack in this industry capacity has beenreduced at least in the short-run and supply problemscould arise if proposals were made to increase considerably public sector demand on the construc-tion industry over a short period. The uncertaintiesfacing the industry could exacerbate the reduced
