**0S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;* government cp(76) 422 July 1976PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1977-78 - THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In our last Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393) which wepublished in February 1976, we said (paragraph 31) -&quot;While the Government recognise the need for spending authoritiesto plan ahead on as firm a base as practicable, the uncertainties inthe prospects for the economy and for world trade and paymentsrule out a firm commitment to expenditure plans.   TheGovernment will therefore be ready to modify and adapt these plansas the general course of the economy and the most important needsof the community require&quot;,THE PROSPECTS AHEAD2.       The prospects had already changed when on 5 March I circulatedmy Memorandum on the Economic Background to the Public expenditure survey 1976 (C(76) 25).    At that time the Treasury economists estimatedthat &quot;the world recession has been deeper and more prolonged and theupturn so far more sluggish than we had reckoned on&quot;.   Moreover, theyassumed only 2 per cent growth in 1976.   I was criticised at the time forbasing the hoped of British recovery too much on the pace of recovery inthe rest of the world.3.        At the beginning of July the picture has changed again.    In fact, the pace of world recovery has turned out to be faster, not slower, than we expected when we drew up the last Whtte Paper.   And the big improvementin our competitivity implied by the 12 per cent depreciation combined withthe 4  per cent pay limit has substantially increased our chance of buildingour recovery on exports and import substitution.   Moreover, our gross domestic Product (GDP) has risen so far this year at 1 per cent a quarter,and it would be reasonable to assume 4 per cent growth for 1976 as a whole.On the other hand, commodity prices have risen in recent months moresharply than we expected and, if the traditional J-curve applies, ourcurrent account deficit on the balance of payments may deterioratesignificantly later this year.COPY NO81CABINET
4,        The main implications of these changes in dux economic prospects are as follows:-a. The demands made on our manufacturing industry for exports and import substitution are likely to require an exceptionally rapid growth of output In 1977 which, if it is to be sustained, may need a parallel increase in productive capacitythrough acceleration of investment unless growth is to be frustrated by supply bottlenecks and overheating.b. The great improvement we have achieved in industrial relations over the last 18 months should mean that the flow ofindustrial supplies is likely to be much less subject to interruptionthan It was in the last two periods of upturn.c. This is the problem to which the International monetary fund (IMF) in their recent consultations with us drew special attention: the need to ensure that scope its available in 1977 for thecontinued development of export-led growth and expansion ofindustrial output through investment.   Their judgment was that thepresently planned levels of net public sector demand on realresources would prove to be excessive in 1977, and, on thealternative monetary analysis, we would be driven intodangerously inflationary monetary financing, with damaging effects on both domestic prices and the external balance of payments.d. It is likely In any case that we shall face substantial defleftson current account of the balance of payments during the next twoyears.   Since our reserves are now low, we shall have to financethese deficits by borrowing abroad.   Most of the foreign government which have the money to lend are likely to insist either that we draw the remaining IMF credit tranches; or that we acceptthe conditions which the IMF would undoubtedly insist on; namely,a specified reduction in our Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR) representing net public sector demand on the economy, withparticular importance being attached to the financial year 1977-78,in order to make room for continued industrial recovery,particularly In exporting and Import-substituting industries, withoutrunning into severe inflation.FINANCING THE PSBR5.       We have rightly done our best to limit unemployment during theyears of recession by accepting a large PSBR.    So far we have been able to finance our PSBR without refuelling Inflation because Industry has not beenborrowing and the private citizen has been saving a higher proportion of hisearnings than ever before.   Thus, In spite of an unprecedented PSBR wehave kept the money supply under control.    It rose only 8 per cent in 1975
compared with 28 per cent in 1973.    On the other hand, the accumulation of debt imposed by our borrowing requires very heavy payments of interestin the coming years; that in itself imposes a limit on our scope for public expenditure in other fields.6,        Now that the economy is recovering we must aim steadily to reduce our PSBR.    Business must be in a position to borrow more for investment,Btockbuilding and increased working capital as recovery proceeds; and private saving is likely to fall as inflation and unemployment fall.   It will,therefore, be difficult to finance a large PSBR except by driving interest rates to levels at which industry cannot afford to borrow, thus choking offthe investment on which sustained growth will depend and without whichthere Is no hope of reducing unemployment to acceptable7 levels.7.        The only alternative would be to print money as the conservative government did In 1972 and 1973, with consequences for Inflation fromwhich we are still suffering.   Indeed, the present prospect Is that the growth of the money supply, which has been fairly stable over the past two years,will be accelerating later this year.   In 1977, with unchanged policies, itmay be growing at a rate faBter than the national income.   H no action were taken to rein back the growth of money we would create an excess ofliquidity which would add to our difficulties.    Our efforts to bring down therate of inflation and maintain the expansion of the economy would be at risk.Moreover the excessive growth of money supply could rapidly spill over intoexternal capital flows and seriously increase our difficultiee in managing the sterling exchange rate.8.       The conclusion therefore must be that, to maintain firm control overthe growth of money supply and at the same time ensure that industry canfinance itself, we need a substantial fall in the public sector deficit in 1977.We have already committed ourselves to taking such action, if necessary,in the White Paper just published - &quot;The Attack on Inflationr The second year&quot; (Cmnd 6507) - when we said in paragraph 31 r*&quot;In addition to exercising firm control of public expenditure, theGovernment are determined to see to it that the money supply doesnot grow too rapidly: the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said hewill ensure that the growth of the money supply is consistent with theGovernment^ plans for the growth of demand expressed in current prices.    The Government are equally determined that the expansionof productive capacity and exports should not be held back bycompeting public sector demands for finance.    These policies willbe reinforced if necessary by further action in the fiscal and monetary fields&quot;.
9.        Other countries are planning rapid returns towards fiscal balance.France intend * to eliminate its budget deficit in 1977,    In the United States,the Federal deficit J* likely to be reduced by at least 25 per cent in the next financial year - and by more if President Ford gets his way.    TheGermans have published a medium-term plan for a reduction of two-thirdsin their deficit by 1979.10.       Our strategy has been to move progressively over three to fouryears towards eliminating the balance of payments deficit and restoring full employment.    As I explained when we considered our expenditure planslast year, there would also have to be a progressive reduction In the public sector deficit,11.        I said then that a deficit at the current level (about 10 per cent ofGDP in 1976-77) &quot;Is not consistent with balance of payments equilibriumunless the other two sectors of the economy are willing to oave in excess oftheir capital expenditure far greater proportions of their incomes than theyhave ever done in the past.    There is no reason to expect such a major change in habits ...    If the Government persisted In raising insufficienttaxation to pay for the resources it was extracting from the economy, theother sectors would one way or another be left with excessive income which they would be likely to spend and would in turn absorb resources fromthe rest of the world,    Jtt therefore follows that if we are to remove our balance of payments deficit over a ran of years to make room for the extraexports required we must reduce the excess of public spending over public sector revenue&quot; (C(75) 62),12.       While we were in the depths of the recession we could not make a start on reducing the PSBR but the worst of the recession is now clearlypast and the time has come, as we always expected it would, to begin.   Asa very rough guide we should be aiming to reduce the PSBR to about 4 percent of GDP over three to four years, ie by an average of about 2 billion a year at present prices.13,       A part of the Improvement required In the PSBR will come aboutautomatically as recovery proceeds and the Government gets morerevenue and pays out fewer benefits.    But since employment lags behindoutput the benefit of this next year will be small, and the bulk of any improvement in the PSBR must come from fiscal action on tax orexpenditure cuts,THE CASE AGAINST TAX INCREASES NEXT YEAR14.       To cut the PSBR in 1977-78 by, say,  1, 000 million throughincreases In income tax would mean increasing the basic rate by 3p,involving a cut tn take-home pay for a single person earning  60 a week of 1.38, for a married couple on the same earnings of  1,17 and for a couple
with two children of 90p.   To out the PSBR by  L000 million by indirect taxation would mean unifying the Value Added Tax rate at 12$ per cent plusincreases In the duties on drink, tobacco or petrol, which would togetherincrease the Retail Price Index by 21-2$ per cent.    These cuts in realtake-home pay would come towards the end of a year when ft had alreadyfallen by 3-4 per cent.15.      Thus I do not believe it would make sense to plan on large increases In direct or indirect taxation next April since both would causean immediate fall in real take-home pay in the middle of a pay round inwhich the unions accepted an exceptionally low and strict pay limit in returnfor tax cats.   Moreover next April may well fall in the middle of our negotiations concerning pay policy in the following round.   A collapse in ourpay polity would do us irreparable harm at that time.16.       K, on the other hand, we sought to reduce the deficit through bigincreases In company taxation, we would frustrate the industrial investment on which sustained growth depends.   For these reasons, public expenditure must make a major contribution to the necessary adduction innext year&apos;9 PSBR by reducing public consumption of goods and services.THE SIZE AND TIMING OF CUTS IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE17.      Ih my judgment we should aim at public expenditure savings leading to a reduction in the PSBR of  1 billion.   We would be wise to link this reduction with a statement of our objectives for the PSBR in 1977-78 andwith measures to control the money supply and to reduce excess liquidity.On the other hand to publish acceptable objectives for the PSBR or to setlimits for the growth of the money supply without simultaneously taking steps to achieve these objectives would carry conviction with no-one.18.      H, however, reductions In expenditure are to be carried through Inan orderly way, the more notice the better.   Unless we take decisions toreduce public expenditure In 1977-78 in the near future, we shall be left with no alternative except swingeing Increases In taxation at the worstpossible moment for our incomes policy.19.      There are, in my view, overriding arguments for seeking to take andpublish our decisions on public expenditure reductions before the Houserise8 for the Recess.    Otherwise we would have to recall the House duringthe Recess or wait until November.   I do not think we can safely waft thatlong.    There has been significant pressure on the sterling rate, even since we announced the $5.3 billion standby credit.20.      If we rise for the Recess without making such an announcement the pressure on sterling is likely to resume and we may face a choice betweenletting the rate collapse, with unacceptable consequences for inflation and
for our agreement with the Trades Union Congress, or spending the wholeof the standby credit without any assurance it will be sufficient to hold therate for long.    In that case we would be forced to the IMF in a crisis inwhich our ability to negotiate acceptable terms for further drawings wasvery weak.    Moreover, our remaining credit with the IMF is only for$3,800 million - far less than ie required to repay the $5.3 billion standbycredit, still less to finance the external deficits we expect over the nextfew years.21,       For all these reasons I believe that we should decide, and announcebefore the Rocese, reductions in public expenditure for 1977-78 designed toreduce the borrowing requirement by about   1 billion.    To achieve this Infull would require cuts amounting to about  1* billion.    This Is equivalentto a general cut of 2j per cent in programmes - a very difficult task when we are far from being able to guarantee that the limits set by the last white paper will be adhered to.    But the threat to our economic strategy forsustained growth and a return to full employment will be far greater If wefail to make these reductions.CONCLUSIONS22,       I therefore propose that we should take the enclosed memorandumby the Chief Secretary, Treasury, as a basis for decisions which will achieve the reductins in public expenditure in 1977-78 which I have described.D W treasury Chambsrc2 July 1976
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE  1976 SURVEYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.1.     The plan which we announced in our last Public Expenditure white paper was that (apart from debt interest) the total would continue torise in 1976-77, but that, in the following years, it would be stabilised at about the level projected for 1976-77.   This meant thatthe previously planned increases in most programmes had to be scaleddown,   up to that point public expenditure had increased by 20 per centin real terms since 1972. while our national output had risen by only  per cent.   The object of our medium-term strategy was, by stabilisingthe level of resources allocated to public expenditure, to make as muchas possible ofour annual growth in wealth available for industrialgrowth, for closing the balance of payments gap, and for some increasein real take-home pay.2.     we now have to review our public expenditure plans up to 1979-80,and to bring into account a further year ahead, 1980-81.   As background&quot;laterial the usual report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee hasbeen circulated.    In addition, I enclose a Treasury Report, which draws0n that material, and sets out to present the salient figures and issues,as a basis for our policy decisions without itself making any policy^ecofnmen da t io n s.3.     The planning and control of public expenditure involves both thedecisions which we take following each year&apos;s medium-term survey;    thedecisions -taken during the year in between surveys; and the implementationQf those decisions.   The new system of cash limits, the new financial^formation system for central Government expenditure, and the improvedsystems of returns for expenditure by the local authorities andnati0nalised industries, all these are relevant to the carrying out of0ur plans during the year.   The development of the contingency reserve asan operational arrangement is important in relating our new decisionsduring the year to the planned total.
4.     We have resisted great pressure, domestic and international, to cutplanned expenditure for the current year, but we have renewed our commitment that the contingency reserve for 1976-77 will not be exceeded.The enclosed report suggests that the current year&apos;s problem shouldcontinue to be dealt with on the basis of periodical progress reports to Cabinet, and that the new decisions to be taken on the basis of the1976 survey should be related to future years.   I accept this, but I must make it clear that, although I believe that it will be possible to keepwithout our planned total for 1976-77, this will require the utmostrestraint in restricting hew claims unless they can be matched byoffsetting savings, to those of the very highest priority and even these will have to be limited in amount.Euture years.     As regards future years, the Treasury report poses questions ofProcedure or method, on which I should like to comment, first, and questions of substance, to which I will come presently.   The system of medium-term planning of public sector prograran.es, which necessarilyhas to be carried out mainly in volume terms rather than by forecasting&quot;fcney totals 4 or 5 years ahead - a system which has been developed onthe basis of the Plowden report of 1961 - has been increasingly questionedand some critics see it as a factor in what they regard as the excessiveSrowth of public expenditure.   I am sure that there has been a great dealof room for improvement in the workings of the system - I have already mentioned some of the improvements which we have made - but we have made*t clear to the Expenditure Committee that we should regard it as a^trograde step to abandon medium-term planning.   However, I do think that under the Tories, the system was a factor in their mismanagement of the economy through encouraging them to concentrate their attention on the relatively distant future while the short-term situation was getting outThe report poses the question whether, so long as we are sticking tot White paper, the emphasis should now be put on the implementationthe strategy over the next year or two.   I do not think that in this control.egy which we so painfully hammered out before the
respect we can lay down rules which will hold good for every survey.   Ona future occasion, without losing sight of the short-term situation, we maymil wish to redefine our medium-term objectives.   But in the presentSituation I see a strong case for reverting, as the report puts it, to theearlier practice of taking firm decisions for one year ahead and near-firm decisions for a further year after that, where this is necessary, whileAdhering for the time being as closely as possible to the programme levelsfor subsequent years.   In this way we should neither pre-empt hoped-for future growth before it becomes a real prospect, as so often happened inthe past, nor risk mortgaging the whole benefits of North Sea oil through a continuing accumulation of debt;   but at the same time we should not commit ourselves to cuts in future programmes which should be unnecessaryif we manage our affairs well in the meanwhile, nor do we forego the option of framing plans for further improvements when we have achieved success in our policies.1377-787.    Paragraphs 7 to 10 of the report summarise the figures in the 1976survey.   Both for 1977-78 and 1978-79 the total of the programmes in the survey, drawn up in accordance with the approved ground rules, is closely in line with the corresponding White Paper total - all the figures are inthe range  53-54- billion - and we have a contingency reserve for the first and second years ahead of the same size as we had for the correspondingy*a,rs in the last White Paper.   But these figures do not allow for any ofthe additional bids which have been tabled and which add up to about llj billion in each year.   The report poses the question whether we shouldnew set out to keep to the White Paper planned totals for programmes pluscontingency reserve, or to plan now to exceed or reduce these totals.8.    It is quite clear that there can be no question of exceeding the&quot;hite Paper total:    a decision to do so could well precipitate a renewedunmanageable sterling crisis.   The implication of this is that, at thev*ry least, the Ministers concerned should rearrange their programmes soa* to eliminate or offset the additional bids of  1.6 billion for 1977-78,and I propose that this should be our initial decision.
9.     As regards possible net reductions in 1977-78, I have approached this in terms of feasibility, and I have myself carefully gone through eachprogramme to form a preliminary judgement of what reductions would be administratively and technically feasible, without much addition-to thelegislative programme for such new measures - as distinct from any legislation needed to carry out earlier decisions.   This does not mean that1we will want to adopt measures purely because they are feasible, but \rather that we must rule out those which are not. &apos;10.   The social security programme poses a major problem.   It is thelargest single expenditure block of all and, because of changes indemographic factors and economic assumptions, an increase above the white paper figures is likely unless offsetting savings are made.   But there is relatively little scope for savings unless we are prepared to modify ourstatutory commitment to annual uprating of benefits in line with prices or earnings as the case may be.   Sizeable savings would be possible in umemployment and certain other benefits, without going back on this commitment, but these too would require either legislation or theintroduction of new conditions.   The one possible saving which does notencounter any of these difficulties would be the postponement of non-contributory invalidity pensions for housewives involving about  20 million in 1977-78.11.   On the basis of this appraisal, the greatest scope for new savingswithout legislation is to be found in housing expenditure other than onsubsidies.   Like social security, this programme is running at a much higher level than a few years ago, but it is one in which there are somelarge items which could be cut back quite quickly.   To the extent that weExclude social security from the scope of this exercise, the more we willbe obliged to look towards the housing programme.I do not want to comment in this paper on every single programme,though I should be prepared to give further reasons in discussion for% assessment of what is feasible, but some comment is called for onthe programmes of capital expenditure by the nationalised industries andof support for industry generally.   we are committed to giving priority to support for the manufacturing industry.   Nevertheless this expenditure
must be kept under tight control and must be strictly related to effectiveprojects and programmes.   Some net saving from this whole area would, inmy view, be feasible, but at the most, taking these programmes together,I do not think that we should contemplate any increase above the totalsin last year&apos;s White Paper.13.   The Treasury report discusses the special problem of local authoritycurrent expenditure.   There has been an actual overspend in 1975-76 ofsome  150 million, and there is a likely overspend in 1976-77 of up to 200 million.   We have already said that rate support grant for 1977-78will be related to the White paper programmes, and that local authorities must cut back their expenditure plans to those levels.   This will require an absolute cut in 1977-78 in programmes over which we have no direct control.   The question is whether we should be prepared to restrict rate support grant still further, and ask for a corresponding scaling down oflocal authority spending plans.   If we did so, no doubt some of the localauthorities would comply, in which case, since such a large proportion ofthe expenditure is on education, the teachers would be likely to be furtheraffected.   Other local authorities probably would not comply, so that the cut in grant would be matched by a rise in rates.H.   In the enclosed list I have brought together my estimates of theI reductions which would be feasible in each of the 15 survey programmes in 1977-78* without bringing in any fresh savings on social security or local authority current expenditure.   The resulting total is about 1.5 billion.   Only two of these measures, involving food subsidies and some health service charges, would affect prices;    this would be unwelcome, but the RPI effect would be little more than Hjg,    to the extent that we maintain or increase subsidies at the expense of other expenditure,we affect the level and standard of essential services, and we are also likely to affect employment in the public services.   There are, however,tone transfer payments, such as mortgage lending by local authorities and various of the grants to industry, where action could be taken withoutaffecting prices or directly affecting employment.
t5.   As regards the programmes for 1978-79, in some cases it would be appropriate to carry through the cuts or postponements on a provisionalbasis, to be confirmed or reversed in the next survey.   In some mothercases the economies might be possible only on a once-for-all basis.   Inany event the essence of the approach would be to make a special once-for-aii effort to give the best possible chance for export-led growth.The detailed consequential both for 1978-79 and subsequent years wouldhave to be worked out in the light of our decisions on 1977-78.   Althoughthe additional bids for the later years would have to be held back atthis stage, the existing programmes beyond 1978-79 need not necessarily be affected, except to the extent needed to secure a workable progression,but naturally we should have to consider any special cases where newdecisions affecting the later years could not be put off.16.   I have tried to set out in this paper some of the practical problems that will have to be faced if we are to make savings of  1 billion in the previously planned programmes for 1977-78.   I have deliberately keptdetailed commentary to a minimum at this stage, but the list at the Annexof what I have called &quot;feasible reductions&quot; speaks for itself as far asthe nature of the problem is concerned.   My broad conclusion is that net&quot;vlng. on survey programmes of the order of  1 billion, after offsettingor eliminating additional bids, would be feasible, though they wouldEvolve a number of unpalatable measures.   If we wished at the same timet* reinforce the contingency reserve for 1977-78, so as to give us moreroom for manoeuvre when the time comes, correspondingly greater reductions*0uld be needed now,i explain at paragraph 9 that when I refer to &quot;feasible reductions&quot;,1 refer only to what I believe to be technically and administrativelyfo*eible.   There will no doubt be differing views on the politicalfeasibility of ft number of the Items, and certainly none are easy.   It is however my view that if Cabinet decides to make net savings of  1 billionin 1977.78, they will have to be found from the list in the Annex.   The^eciBiQuB required would include the following:-(1)    Whether the reductions are to be Secured from among those setout in the enclosed list, including a substantial reduction in housing expenditure.
(ii) Whether the social security programme is to be wholly orlargely exempt.(iii) Whether any of the other programmes listed are to be given a substantial degree of relative priority.(iv) Whether we confine our objective on local authority current expenditure in 1977-78 to securing the reductions necessaryto keep to the White paper figures.(v) Whether there are any further possible savings in particularprogrammes which we should consider.

.   SECKETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE 1976 SURVEYReport by the TreasuryIntroduction1.       The report on this year&apos;s survey by the Public expenditure survey Committee has been circulated separately.   It has beanprepared in accordance with the ground rules approved by Cabinet.The figures and the presentation in the PESC Report have been agreedinterdepartmentally.   It is necessarily long and complicated.   ThisTreasury report is designed to meet the requirement for a shorter,simpler piece of work, summarising the figures and focussing attentionon the main issues.The White Paper Plan2.       The last public expenditure exercise required exceptionally-difficult decisions.   These took a long time to reach and the resulting White Paper (Cmnd 6393) did not appear until Bebruary tillsyear.   The plans which it set out were intended broadly to stabilise the level of resources taken by expenditure programme a after 1976-77.If this was achieved, public expenditure would fall as a proportionof national output from its present exceptionally high level, ie 60%.In order to achieve this, most previously planned programmes had tobe scaled down by  3,000 million (at 1975 survey prices) by 197&amp;-79-Other programmes were to increase by about  500 million.3.       For several years the expenditure programmes in successiveWhite Papers had been substantially exceeded in the event, and therewas widespread criticism of the White Paper plan on the grounds thatthe profile of expenditure over the years lacked credibility.   The
Government have therefore made it a prime objective to implement the plan, and prevent it from being frustrated through lack ofwill or failure of control.   This has been regarded as important not only for financial and economic reasons but also to demonstrate country&apos;s ability to plan effectively and achieve objectives.The Government have made it a further objective to get back on cour**by carrying out this year&apos;a survey, and reaching decisions on it,in accordance with a more normal timetable.1975-76 and 1976-774.        Firm estimates of expenditure in the past year, 1975-76, wil1not be available for some months, and the figures in the Survey rep01&apos;do not incorporate all the excess that local authorities seem tospent.   The present assessment is that total expenditure on program-&apos;was quite close to the net provision in the February White Paper.0-verspending by local authorities, including that on housing, larg^offset savings elsewhere.5.        Por 1976-77. as part of the effort to keep within plannedexpenditure totals, the use of the contingency reserve as a decisionmaking instrument has been developed in accordance with the atran$ne***approved by Cabinet.   The contingency reserve in the White Paper ***equivalent, at current prices, to  875 million.   At the date of preparation of this report, Cabinet had agreed to  455 million ofthis being committed.   In the preparation of the Survey report,estimating reductions have been incorporated in the Surrey programme***&apos;&apos;On the other hand, there are additional bids for 1976-7? as well **for future years, and these include some estimating increases in demand-determined services.   Moreover, on the basis of present infe*&quot;nation, it would be imprudent to assume that, in the absence offurther Government measures, local authorities would overspend by    .less than  100 million on current expenditure; and the overspendwell be as much as  200 million, even if the Government is stillpressing for the White Paper figures to be observed.
6.        It will be necessary to decide which, of the additionalbids are either ineluctable or have to be accepted for other reasons.   However, the continued monitoring of the contingency reserve for the current year will be pursued separately, and thapresent report deals with the decisions which need to be taken inthe Surrey on expenditure programmes for the subsequent years.   Butit should be noted meanwhile that the contingency reserve for1976-77 remains under strain.   It will still therefore be necessaryto pursue vigorously the action decided by Cabinet on 20 Nay toexamine ways of offsetting the prospective excess on housing expendi-ture and of cutting down claims on the contingency reserve by national-ised industries, and also  to keep any overspend on local authoritycurrent expenditure to the irreducible minimum.future Years - Programmes in the Survey7*        The programmes for 1977-78 and later years set out in the survey Report are designed to carry forward so far as possible the programmes published in the White Paper, in accordance with theground-rules which took the implementation of the White Paper plan as a starting point for the 1976 exercise.   But the programmes havebeen revalued to 1976 survey prices, and estimating reductions havebeen taken into account.   Also, additional expenditure approved sincethe White Paper has been incorporated in tha programmes; and theUnite Paper figures for the contingency reserve have been adjusteddownwards.The resulting picture can be summarised as follows:-S E C H   T3

Thus, the totals of programmes plus contingency reserve inthe Survey are constrained broadly within the White Paper plan.   Butthis is achieved only because the Survey programmes take account ofsome estimating reductions, while estimating increases are treatedunder the Survey ground rules as part of the additional bide on which decisions have to he taken.   The ground rules provided that bids could he tabled for additions to the White Paper programmes, if departmentsoonsidered this necessary either for the purpose of existing policies(and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish which of these bidsshould be regarded as estimating increases), or to   enable new polici**or projects to be introduced.   The total amount of aia^the bids whichhave been tabled in the Survey, and which are sunmaciaad ma programmebasis in Annex A to this report, is as follows:-

Those bids, if accepted, would use up the contingency reserve and produce an excess over the White Paper totals for the next twoyears. But the nature of the individual bids varies substantially.A limited number are demand-determined in the strict sense and may beineluctable or very nearly so.   Others flow from existing schemes butthe schemes are capable of being changed to reduce expenditure.   Somebids constitute demands for improvement or new measures which couldb* rejected or postponed.   All these will be matters for decision.Decision, required11.      The Government now have to decide between three broad approaches:-(a) To keep to the White Paper planned totals.   To achieve this, while maintaining an adequate contingency reserve for future years, the additional bids, including theestimating increases on demand-determined services, wouldhave either to be eliminated, or else offset by reductions in existing programmes.(b) To increase the planned totals above the White Paperfigures.(c) To reduce planned totals below the White Paper figures.A decision between these three broad policies will have toseen in terms of,and accompanied by, the concrete decisions
required on particular programmes.   Thes individual decisions in turn nave to be taken in terms of the specific measures requiredin order to give effect to them.   Even to implement the existingWhite Paper plan, specific measures remain to be taken in order to achieve some of the savings incorporated in the White Paper figures.The cases involved are:-Reductious in housing subsidiesSavings on school mealsReductions in the cost of overseas studentsThe  140 million civil service manpower savings13.      On the other hand, although concrete decisions on particularprogrammes and measures are needed for at least one year ahead inall cases, and perhaps more in some cases, such decisions are notnecessarily required on all programmes for the whole period coveredby the survey.   This point is discussed further below.Which years?14.      In last year*s exercise the focus year for decisions was1973-79-   This was appropriate in an exercise designed to evolve anew medium-term strategy for public expenditure and a better balance in the economy over a period of years.   So long as the Governmentare sticking to that strategy, whether or not with limited modification0to the totals for particular years, then it becomes a matter of year-by-year budgeting on the lines of the agreed strategy, and the focus shift0to the earlier years of the survey period.   This would be a reversion to the approach adopted in some earlier stages of the development ofthe present public expenditure system, entailing decisions on firmprogrammes only for the first year ahead (that is, in the presentexercise, 1977-78) and near-firm programmes for the-second year ahead(1978-79).
15.      There are now special reasons for restoring the emphasis on the earlier years, and particularly on the year immediatelyaaead.   First, the credibility of the expenditure profile, andthua of the Government&apos;s whole strategy in this field, will dependcrucially on keeping the planned total next year to this yearfs level** most.   The decision between the three courses listed above must^refore be taken in relation to 1977-78 la the first instance.*V     In addition, the Chancellors statement on 7 June, following*ae, sterling crisis, said that, for the current year, the Governmentvere determined to ensure that the planned total of expenditure is*ot exceeded; that they were now reviewing expenditure programmes for future years in the normal way; and that they would adjust these programmes in good time as required to meet the prior claims of exports and investment in the light of the expected pace of recovery.% implication, any such adjustment must relate to 1977-78 in thefirst instance.V.      it would in principle be open to Ministers to take decisions*bout either 1977-78 only, or about 1977-78 and 1978-79, in advanceof settling programme figures for the whole survey period.   In any*ant the status of the figures for the later years would be differentsince they will remain subject to year-by-year review in successive***rcises.   whatever provisional  view is taken about the prospectivePublic expenditure totals for the later years, Ifcere are many^vidual programmes on which firm decisions are neither necessarypossible now for as long as 4-5 7*ar* *he*d. iamtance,blowing last year&apos;s review of the procedures for approving theVestment programmes of the nationalised industries, approval far100 per cent of the programme figures is  given only for the comingy*ar (1977-78) with an 85 per cent approval for the subsequent year70 per cent for the year after that.SECRET
Areas for decision18.      There are 15 programmes in the Survey (9 of them account for over 85% of the total) and decisions are required on these and onthe size of the contingency reserve.   These are summarised in the annex.   The total of public expenditure is made up of these itemstogether with shortfall and debt interest, but these last two itemscannot be planned but only estimated, and do not require decisions.At the same time, in taking decisions on the planned total of programmes and the contingency reserve, it is necessary to consider to what extent the sum total of public expenditure may be affected by movements in shortfall and debt interest.19.      Estimates of debt interest are highly volatile, and depend onassumptions about future inflation, rates of interest and the size of the borrowing requirement.   On present assumptions it is estimatedthat the figures for debt interest which appeared in the last white paper should be scaled down by some hundreds of millions (this isof course nothing   like the scale of the increase in estimated debt interest which was disclosed in the White Paper) but this estimate is liable to further revision before the next White Paper, accordingto the assumptions which seem the most realistic at the time.For the time being, this reduction in the estimate of debt interestcould be regarded as roughly accounting for the estimated shortfallwhich was assumed in the last White Paper.20.      In the case of a number of programmes, a larger or smaller partof the functional programme is not in fact controlled functionally,but forms part of local authority current expenditure; this is not subject to direct control, whether in total or in its distributionbetween local authorities and services, though its size and distributionis influenced by Government policies and by the rate support grant.The estimates for 1976-77 compiled in May, on the basis of new returnsfrom the local authorities, showed that they had overspent the white paper figures in the previous year and were budgeting for a further substantial excess in the current year.   In requesting that this excessshould be cut back, the Government made it clear that in any event8
the rate support grant for the following year, 1977-78, wouldbe based on the White Paper figures.21.      To the extent that the local authorities fail, in the event,to cut back this year&apos;s current spending to the White Paper level,the actual amount spent next year would have to be got down belowthis year&apos;s figures, in order to be brought into line with the white paper projections.   It has already been explained in paragraph 5that local authorities may well overspend in the current year andthe present expectation is that, in the absence of further government measures, they may well again overspend in 1977-78 by a broadlycomparable amount, ie  100-200 million.   There is, therefore, ageneral question which cuts across these functional programmes, iewhether the   Government wishes to set local authorities the target of cutting expenditure in 1977-78 below the White Paper level, and,if so, whether it would be realistic to plan in the expectation thatthey would do so.   It may well be that the effect of setting such a target might be to produce a better chance of getting down to theWhite Paper levels, though not in practice below them.   The answers to these general questions will affect the decisions on the choice of options for those programmes in which local authority current expenditure forms an important part.22.      As regards the contingency reserve, the figure which hasbeen included for 1977-78 in the Survey is about the same, in real terms, as the reserve provided for 1978-77 ln last February&apos;s white paper.   But there are. still 9 months to go until 1977-78 even begins.If any new claims on the reserve were to be accepted without replen-Fishing it by savings on expenditure programmes, this year1s experiencesuggeststhat the remaining reserve would be too small in relationto the bids that can be expected during the course of a year.SECRET9
23. The ground rules for the public expenditure surveyprovided both for the tabling of additional bids and for theworking out of options for reducing the survey programmes by Z\per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per cent in 1973-79.   A general 2$ percent reduction of planned expenditure programmes in 1977-78 wouldinvolve about  1.3 billion; this would reduce the public sectorborrowing requirement by about  1 billion.   In relation to 1977-78the contribution to be made by public expenditure savings to a reductionin the borrowing requirement would depend less on arguments ofprinciple about the balance between changes in expenditure and taxationsand less on considerations of what financial opinion might expect, than-on what is feasible in making adjustments for the year immediately ahead.   In some programmes reductions of 2-J- per cent would be feasible *in others more, and in others less.HM TreasuryJune 1976SECRET
