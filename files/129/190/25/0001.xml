\&quot;ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 5013 July 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. The proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Secretary, Treasury, for cuts in our programme in 1977-78 mayhave damaging effects on Department of Energy programmes.    If otherspending Departments are in a similar position, the Cabinet will haveto consider the possibility that cuts on the scale requested cannotrealistically be achieved.    Even if the full cuts were decided now, theGovernment&apos;e economic policy is still likely to be seen to be totally inadequate within a few months.    Instead we should decide on suchpracticable savings in public expenditure as can be identified withoutdamage to our economic strategy or the social contract, press ahead with urgent negotiations to stabilise sterling, and prepare a new economicprogramme to announce in the autumn.EXPENDITURE CUTS IN DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY PROGRAMMES2.         65 million of the British National Oil Corporation&apos;8 (BNOC) bidfor 1977-78 can notionally be transferred back to the contingency fund,provided that this does not mean that BNOC is subsequently forced to forgo investments which would hie Id a high return, largely in the formof foreign currency.    But the further  100 million of cuts proposed forenergy investment and Research and Development is contrary to theGovernments declared strategy of promoting productive investment and strengthening manufacturing industry.3.        The existing bids of nationalised energy industries are &quot;mid-point&quot;estimates from which most over-estimating has already been cut out oothe understanding that this Government can be trusted to take realisticaccount of their needs.    The view of the industries would be that it isindefensible for the Government to cut investment by nationalised bodiesat a time when it is vigorously trying to promote private industry.    Theeffect of cuts in investment would be:-a.    to damage manufacturing industries by halting ordersfor plant and equipment;copy NO      81
b. to necessitate Some reductions in employment in the nationalised industries on which consultation with the relevanttrade unions has not been possible;c. to require additional investment later to make good projects which have to be temporarily held up.INADEQUACY OF THE PROPOSED MEASURES4,        If other spending Departments are in a similar position and find that cuts on the overall scale suggested (elimination of  1. 6 billionadditional bids plus net reductions in spending of  1 billion or more)cannot be achieved without very serious damage, the whole strategy ofcuts will have to be reconsidered.5.        Even if the full cuts proposed by the Chancellor were feasible,they would buy as at most only a very brief breathing space.    By Hieautumn our economic policy will still be seen to be inadequate in the face of rising unemployment, exhaustion of foreign credit, stagnation of private investment and a growing trade deficit.RE COMMENDA TIONS6.        Instead of going ahead with cuts on the scale proposed by theChancellor, we should -a. adopt limited savings in public expenditure from thebaseline of existing plans including the additional bids;b. start immediate negotiations with the international monetary Fund and the Oil Producing and Exporting Countriescreditors to obtain a medium-term settlement of the sterlingcrisis;c. start work now on a full programme of new measures forthe autumn, including -i.       restructuring taxation to improve public sector revenue;ii.       import controls;iii.       emergency planning agreements backed by theNational Enterprise Board and an investment reserve fund.A W BDepartment of Energy13 July 1976 ,
