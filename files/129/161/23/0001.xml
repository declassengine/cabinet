THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty is government cp(7?) 2328 February 1972CABINETTHE POST-APOLLO programme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. In November 1970 the Cabinet considered proposals by theEuropean Space Conference (ESC) for studies of the post-apollo programme, the major objective of which is to reduce costs by developing a space transport system which permits the re-utilieationof equipment (see Annex I),    The proposals then foresaw participation in the development programme itself and were linked to the developmentof the ELDO EUROPA III launchers in which we had refused to join.    Itwas decided that we should decline to participate in the proposed studiesand inform our ESC partners that we could not support a programme inwhich the costs and benefits were so ill-defined as they were at that time(CM(70) 35th Conclusions, Minute 5),    No studies were then undertakenbut discussions with the Americans have continued,2, In order to decide whether to accept the \merican invitation toparticipate in the development programme and if so what part should be played, the ESC propose to undertake further studies on the tug andpayload development.    The United Kingdom share would be  240,000of a total of  1,2 million.    All our partners (except the Netherlands whoare hesitating) have agreed to contribute.    The timetable of consultationsproposed by the ESC is at Annex II,    We think this is optimistic and theESC countries would be unlikely to sign firm agreements in Septemberbefore the tug and payload studies were completed and they knew whatwork they could expect,3, The Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision related to the circumstances atthat time,    I believe we should participate in the studies because:a. Our partners do not regard themselves as committed tothe development programme by the studies;  which are part of thenormal phase-by-phase approach to development programmes,b. The cost is insignificant in comparison with the scale of a project which might well bring significant opportunities to Britishindustry and which will change the nature of space technology,particularly that for satellites, in the 1980s,COPY NO      g 
c. The post-Apollo programme itself is better defined than in1970 and now has the United States Presidents backing,,d. The studies would give us a better opportunity of deciding what part, if any, we wished to play in the post-Apollo programme,e. British firms would certainly receive valuable design workon the studies (Hawker Siddeiey Dynamics would probably be primecontractors), but it has been made clear that they would be excludedif we did not join.f. The studies relate to design for space vehicles of the 1980swhich will be useful for any future work,g. We should be helping our partners to formulate a Europeanresponse to the Americans&apos; invitation.h. British industry will feel t^at the option to enter the post-Apollo programme has been closed by the Government at anindecently early stage:  this will be particularly harmful to recentmoves by the space industry to draw together into Europeaninternational consortia.In agreeing to bear our share of the cost of the studies we should makeit clear that this does not carry with it any undertaking to participate inthe eventual development.    Moreover I would approach the Governmentsinvolved to secure agreement that we should not take definitive decisionsuntil sufficient information is available for us to judge the advantages of participation in any part of the development programme.4. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that the United kingdom should participate in the studies now proposed,J d department of Trade and Industry28 February 1972
ANNEX   ITHE PCST-APOLLO programme        As originally put to Europe in 1969 the programme consisted of a completelyre-usable space transportation system and a space station but, in order to reducedevelopment cost, the concept has been considerably modified.    It is now firmlydefined and the main components are briefly described in the following paragraphs:-THE SPACE TRANSPORTATION system      This consists of the Space Shuttle and the Space Tug.   The main component of the Space Shuttle is the Orbiter which is to be operated by a crew of two and can&apos;carry two passengers.    In order that it may return to Earth and land onan airfield it looks like an aircraft of approximately the Concorde type but itis injected into its orbit by a large rocket engine.   The propellants for thisengine, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, are carried in a large external tankwhich, unlike the Orbiter, is not recovered.   The Orbiter is the second stage ofthe Shuttle, the first stage being a large, unmanned Booster which, after burn-out and separation, descends into the sea by parachute to be recovered for further use.The cargo bay of the Orbiter is oO ft long and 15 ft in diameter, occupies almost all of its length and has large doors on the upper side to enable a full size payloadto go in and out in one piece.   Payloads weighing up to 65,000 lbs are to be takeninto orbit.3      To move some of these payloads from the low orbit achieved by the Shuttleto other orbits, such as the geostationary one of special interest for communications purposes, the system is to use the Space Tug which will itself be taken into orbit in the Shuttle.    It is to have a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygenengine and to be fully re-usable, a typical mission being to go into low orbitin the Orbiter&apos;cargo bay already attached to a payload, take this payload togeostationary orbit, separate from it, rendezvous v/ith another geostationarysatellite which requires repair or maintenance and bring it back to low orbitwhere the Tug and its recovered payload would rendezvous v/ith an Orbiter whichwould take them back to Earth.   American industry is very keen to undertakedevelopment of the Tug but NASA cannot fund it until 3/or k years from now whenthey will be past the peak of their Shuttle expenditure; . because of the considerable annual savings v/hich they expect the Tug.to give in the cost oftheir satellite programme they attach great importance tc having it operationalas soon as possible;    these savings arise mainly from the ability to recover andre-use spacecraft but also from the use of recoverable Tugs in place of expend-able rockets and from design simplification because the acceleration to v/hichpayloads are subjected is much reduced.
ORBITAL SYSTEMSk      Other Shuttle flights will be used to put into low orbit a variety of payloadsto carry out the tasks originally intended for the nannefi space station.   Thesepayloads are Research and Applications Modules (RAK*s) for conducting manned andman-tended experiments and observations for both scientific and technologicalpurposes.   A detailed study by American industry has defined this RAM system as a family of modules with many components in common and suitable for evolutioninto free-flying spacecraft or even, by connecting several RAM&apos;s together, intoa miniature space station.   After reaching orbit the carg: bay doors would be opened and the RAH would pivot through S&apos;0O about its forward end and thus projectinalmost completely from the Orbiter but remaining attaches to it by a light structurand a flexible tube through which the Orbiter crew would enter the RAH forobservations and experiments.   They could continue this -work in orbit for up toabout ? days after which the RAM would be rotated back through 90O, the cargo baydoors would be closed and the Orbiter complete with its payload would return toEarth.5      The version of the RAM just described is generally known as the Sortie-RAMbut shortage of money may prevent NASA from funding the 2AM family as early as theywould like.    In case this happens they have recently carried out an in-house study of what they call the Sortie Can.   This is a substitute for the Sortie-RAM but would use available sub-systems (eg from Gemini and Apollo) as much as possible and would not provide any evolutionary capability towards the other objectives of the RAH system.POSSIBILITIES FOR -EUROPEAN PARTICIPATION6      NASA&apos;s principle objective in seeking European participation is to have anoperational Space Tug and/or RAM system several years earlier than it could achieve them on its own.   They have therefore pressed European authorities toundertake a major development task in the Space Tug, RAM and Sortie Can fieldbut their objective would be met if, for instance, Europe undertook to carry outdevelopment work on any parts of the system to a value equivalent to that of thecost of Tug development since this would enable NASA to divert funds immediately to the Tug.    In the early stages of discussion between NASA and European officialsit seemed that European participation in the Shuttle might, alone be sufficientto achieve this NASA objective but&apos;, now that NASA has completed its Shuttledefinition and examined work packages in detail, they have concluded that thetight schedule coupled with the complexity of many of the interfaces limits thepossibilities of European participation in Shuttle development to 5 structuralwork packages (in the Orbiter) of which the cost is expected to be about one-sixthof that of the Tug.    It is thus open to Europe to participate in the post-apollo programme by a combination of developments spread over the Tug, RAM, Sortie Can
confidential and Orbiter but the detailed choice is a matter for negotiation.TECHNICAL INTEREST7       On the basis that the United kingdom&apos;s main interest in space lies inapplications satellites the most useful area for post-Apollo participation isthe Tug since it has more in common with satellites than does the HAH or theOrbiter.   Less relevant to applications satellites but very relevant totechnological (eg engineering process) experiments in space, which may laterinterest the UK because of economic benefit, is work cn the RAM family and theSortie Can.   The available work on the Crbiter does not bear directly on any future space work which the UK is likely to undertake but it involves the design of very efficient aircraft structures and would be a useful occupation for high quality aircraft design teams and could help to keep them available for other purposes.8      The Tug is a difficult project, certain to enhance the reputation and thetechnical capability of the company which completes it satisfactorily;    the main 1problems lie in the extreme lightness required in the structure and all of the equipment, in the very high performance required of the rocket engine and in the design of the system for automatic (unmanned) rendezvous and docking.    Providedthat the United Kingdom contributes quickly to ESR01s funding of the Phase A Tugstudies the strong position which KSJD have established on the Tug can bemaintained and could be expected to lead to their becoming the prime contractorif Europe undertook Tug development and the UK decided to participate.   Europeanstudies in the Sortie Can/RAM area have still to begin but BAC would be theprime contractor for one of the main consortia if the UK contributed to thisyear&apos;s budget.   Work undertaken by Europe on the Orbiter would be on sub-contractsplaced directly on European firms by the American prime contractor for the Shuttlework through 1971 has shown NASA that British firms (HSA and BAC) and Germanfirms are technologically competent but NASA*s current view is that only thetwo British firms show a sufficient grasp of the organisational and managementproblems so the British firms&quot; position appears to be strong.
