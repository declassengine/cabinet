HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 13 COPY NO      g  7 February 1972CABINETSITE OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT office memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster. The Ministerial Committee on Europe have been unable to reach any agreed conclusion on the proposal put forward by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry in the attached memorandum that we shouldmake a bid to have the European Patent Office (EPO) sited in this country.The Committee therefore invited me to refer this issue to the Cabinet for decision.2.        Some members of the Committee were in favour of our making abid because -i. This is the first occasion on which we have had a chance to try to get a major Community institution to this country.    our prospects of success in this instance are probably small, as theGermans have been pressing for some time to have the EPO set upm Munich and they are now understood to have secured the supportof the French.    But by making a bid we should be strengtheningour bargaining position for the future when decisions come to betaken about the location of other institutions - in particular theEuropean Meteorological Centre, which is at present the only other institution not already established in one of the existingCommunity countries.ii. If, contrary to expectations, our bid for the EPO were to prove successful, the presentational advantages of having a majorEuropean institution here would be considerable;  and although the potential economic benefits, in particular to British industry, are largely unquantifiable, they would certainly also be substantial.3.        Other members were opposed to our making a bid because i. If our bid was to carry conviction, we should have to beready to provide the EPO with a rent-free office in Central london at an estimated capital cost of  40 million.    The Department ofthe Environment consider that it would be necessary to use1
compulsory purchase powers in order to acquire a suitable site,and new legislation would be required before*e they could exercise such powers on behalf of a European institution.    There would also have to be a public enquiry, which could prove to be controversial,and it is doubtful, in view of all the time that would necessarily betaken before a site could finally be acquired, whether an office could be made ready by 1976, when the EPO is to start operations.ii. It would appear inconsistent with our regional policies forus to seek to bring such a major new office development to central london.    On the other hand a bid for somewhere like Edinburghwould be even less likely to succeed than one for London and weshould only be laying ourselves open to criticism later for raisingfalse hopes.iii. We shall eventually have to concede that the EPO and its staff should receive sweeping fiscal privileges.    The presence inthis country of an Office whose staff were exempt from tax could lead to serious public criticism.4. My own view is that we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to begin to press our case for having at least one major European institutionin this country.    We should therefore express our interest in having theEPO in London and indicate our willingness to acquire a suitable site.Our existing position on the question of fiscal privileges could be entirelyreserved at this stage.    We should seek to ensure that our bid attractedas little publicity as possible, in the expectation that on this occasion weshould not be successful.    But if, unexpectedly, we were successful, weshould go all out to make the most of the substantial advantages whichlocation of the EPO in this country would offer us.    K not, we should havestrengthened our case when the siting of the European meteorological office, for which the Germans were also the leading other contender,comes up for decision.G cabinet office February 19722
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry This memorandum seeks agreement that the United Kingdom shouldbid to have the proposed European Patent Office (EPO) sited in thiscountry.2      The EPO will be a large organisation granting patents in english, French and German (but predominantly in English) for upto 20 countries.   For the e.c. states these will be unitary &quot;Community&quot;patents.   It will be the focus of a complex activity involvingindustry, patent agents and lawyers, for which the United kingdom would be an appropriate base. (See Annex I)3      OTHER BIDDERSWe have not been eligible to bid hitherto, because the EPO mustbe in an e.c. country.   Bids have already been made for The Hague,Luxembourg and Munich.   In 1969 we undertook to support the Dutchbid.   But it has little or no other support, and though we musthonour our undertaking there is now no reason why, after consulting the Dutch, we should not offer a United Kingdom alternative in casetheir bid fails.   Luxembourg is not taken seriously.   The Germans,however, are very keen.     They have reserved an attractive site next to the German Patent Office, held an architectural competition, and offered to build and equip the EPO at German expense.   If we can make a sufficiently attractive bid, we may expect support from countries who have reservations about a German site.   If not, itseems inevitable that the EPO will go to Munich.     But to have any chance of success our bid needs to be made as soon as possible after we have signed the Treaty of Accession.4      THE CASE FOR MAKING A BIDAlthough to do so will raise problems of accommodation and fiscalprivileges, which are discussed later, there /are the followingarguments for making a bid:a      If we wish to have a European institution in this country,there are currently only two we can bid for.     The other one isthe European Meteorological Centre.   The Germans may also bidfor that, although we have already indicated that we would liketo see it situated at Bracknell.   To bid for both institutionswould improve our chances of getting one.b      The EPO will become the centre for all European patentingoperations including a considerable amount of business from america, with enhanced employment prospects for Britishpractitioners.   It will be a.direct material advantage to
British industry in terms of cost and convenience to &quot;be able to prosecute patent applications here rather than abroad. Britishindustry and practitioners have urged us strongly to make a hid.c       Indirect economic benefits will accrue from patent-associated commercial activities and increased spending here by foreign visitors.d       Because English-language applications will predominate,locating the EPO at the main source of English languageexaminers will both minimise expatriation expenses and maximiserecruitment prospects.   Recruitment of such examiners in Munichwould not be easy.S       ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS IN THIS COUNTRYThrough the attractions of a provincial site (particularlyEdinburgh) are considerable, I do not believe an offer of anywherebut London would be accepted.    (See Annex II).6      DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN MAKING A BIDa      Fiscal PrivilegesA credible bid must carry an assurance that we will accept and apply whatever privileges are finally agreed for the EPOand its staff.   Negotiations on this point are not yet concludednor can our bid await their conclusion, but it is alreadyapparent (see Annex III) that such a bid may involvereconsidering last year&apos;s decision (HA(71) 7th Meeting, Item 3)to resist the grant of fiscal privileges.    In my view this shouldnot be allowed to stand in the way of a bid.b      AccommodationWe shall also have to guarantee, as the Germans have done that appropriate accommodation will be available in good time.   Thisentails acquiring and preparing a suitable site or buildingbefore the EPO has formally come into being.   But to do thatwill need special legislation, conferring powers which theGovernment does not possess under the Office of Works Act (1852).Such legislation is probably inevitable if we are to attract anyCommunity institution here.   In addition, acquisition of a sitein Central London would most probably involve compulsory purchase.c      Financial Implications (see Annex IV)The capital cost of providing a building in. Central london would be about  40 million, or somewhat less elsewhere.Other costs, including the possible loss7 of revenue from fiscalprivileges, might amount to  2.75 million a year on the leastfavourable assumptions.   There would be gains of perhaps  10million a year to the balance of payments, some minor directfinancial gains to industry, substantial but unquantifiablebenefits of convenience to industry and some unquantifiableindirect economic benefits.
J d department of Trade and industry Victoria StreetLONDON SW1H OET26   January 19727       PUBLIC PRESENTATIONThe way in which a bid is presented publicly will need careful consideration at the time, in the light of the Dutchreaction and of our assessment of the chances of success.8       RECOMMENDATIONI seek agreement that:a      it is desirable to have the European Patent office in this country.b      neither the need for legislation to acquire a site, northe building costs, nor the possibility of having to grantfull fiscal privileges rules out a bid.c a bid should therefore be made soon after signature of theTreaty of Accession to the Common Marketsd steps should be taken at once to permit the bid to be accompanied by appropriate assurances as to accommodation.e      the practicalities demand that the bid be for Londonrather than a provincial site.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT THE EUROPEAN PATENT office      The European Patent Office (some 1,700 staff) will be set up under a Convention now being negotiated by 20 Western european countries and expected to be ready for signature in 1973.     the aim is to start operations in 1976.     EPO will not be merely the secretariat of an intergovernmental organisation.     It will be thecentre of a complex activity involving close contacts betweenindustry, patent   agents and lawyers and EPO staff, and will grantEuropean patents effective in each member country.     The result willbe a reduction in the work done by national patent offices includingour own and an eventual financial gain to the Exchequer of about 8 million, irrespective of where the EPO is located.     A SecondConvention restricted to e.c. States will provide that the EuropeanPatent shall for them be a unitary Community patent.     The EPO willadminister Community patents and determine their validity.     Thus,while not a Community institution, the EPO will be strongly Community-linked, and will, in part, fulfil a Community function.2      The EPO will operate in English, French and German.     It is common ground that at least 60 per cent of the applications will bein English.     A large proportion of the 600 or so graduate scientists and engineers who will form the examining staff will need a goodcommand of English and should preferably have English as their nativetongue. .3      However, the main patent countries of Europe, and particularly the examining countries, must be adequately represented on the staffso that,, wherever the EPO is located, at least 25% of the staff willbe expatriate.
ANNEX   1 IALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS   IN THE UNITED kingdom      London offers the following advantages as a location -a      London is recognised throughout Europe as the social,cultural, commercial and legal capital city of the United Kingdomb       London, alone of our cities, can better Munich&apos;s technical and legal libraries, and houses a comprehensive foreign patentcollection (in the NRLSI).c      The British Patent Office, which ought to operatealongside the European Patent Office, is already located inLondon.d      Communications from the major foreign industrial centresare at present better to London than to Munich.2      Edinburgh has the following attractions as an alternative toLondon for the location of the EPO .-a      It is a capital city in its own right, it houses Scotland&apos;principal legal, financial and commercial institutions, and itis recognised internationally as a cultural centre.b      Edinburgh is in an Intermediate Area and in accordance withthe Governments regional policy should be preferred to london as a location for an undertaking of this kind unless there arecompelling reasons for its rejection.c      Edinburgh could make available in good time a site at a considerably lower cost than for a London location, involving a proportionately smaller rent subsidy commitment.d      Although Edinburgh has at present no direct air links with european cities its airport is being extended and improved and direct flights to a number of centres in Europe could be inoperation by the mid-1970s.     Edinburgh has already an excellentfeeder service to Heathrow with good connections to Continentalcities, and the total city centre to city centre journey time between Edinburgh and European centres is in some cases lessthan 1 hour in excess of the corresponding journey time from central London.e      Edinburgh has excellent legal libraries and sciencelibraries (the two University libraries and the library of theRoyal Society of Edinburgh), though it does not at present havea first class technical library.3      The EPO, if in the United Kingdom, must be located in the sameplace as the British Patent Office, a first class, technical libraryincluding the main foreign patent collection, and the seat of operation of the specialist patent judges (who constitute the PatentAppeal Tribunal and deal with the vast bulk of patent litigation) andthe English patent bar, since all these are intimately boundtogether in day-to-day contact.     Location in Edinburgh would,therefore, involve transfer of all these institutions to Edinburghtogether with the patent agents who are now centred on London.     Timedoes not permit the exploration, before making a bid, of all thatvould be involved in such a transfer.     It does not seem, therefore,that a bid of fering Edinburgh has any chance of success.
IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGESA protocol has been drafted which gives general legal immunities and fiscal privileges to the EPO and its staff.     Last yearMinisters instructed our delegation to resist the grant of fiscalprivileges (primarily immunity from national income tax) on theground that the EPO. because it would be performing a licensing rolefor private persons and firms in payment of fees, was like acommercial organisation and did not therefore justify fiscalprivileges (HAC(7l) 7th Meeting, Item 3).    The delegation took this line at a Conference in April   but met with no support.     TheConference decided that the EPO &quot;should have the same basicprivileges and immunities as those generally accepted for international organisations&quot;, and referred the Protocol to a working party to bring its provisions more into line with this decision.The Working Party will meet early this year when our delegation will again put forward the viewpoint expressed by Ministers, both in anattempt to rally support and also with a view to exposing the reasons why other countries consider the grant of fiscal privileges to bejustified.     Although in the past all members of the e.c. have acceptedthe Council of Europe principles, that immunities and privilegesshould be limited to those required for an organisation^ functionalneeds and not used as inducements to attract such institutions, the outcome of the EPO discussions is uncertain and our views may notprevail.To accept that this new type of international organisation, whichin important respects has the character of a commercial undertaking,should enjoy in this country immunities and fiscal privileges - thelatter having the effect of subsidising applicants and patentees outof tax-payers&apos; money - runs counter to the restrictive policy whichwe have so far adopted.     In this case there would be the addeddifficulty of many of our own Patent Office staff transferring tothe EPO and then enjoying immunities and privileges includingexemption from income tax.     But if a bid for London is to stand any chance of success, we must be prepared to accept whatever privileges and immunities are finally agreed.
FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF LOCATING THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE IN london      operations ol.&apos; I&apos;hi&apos; OJMMcpIrrespective of the location of the Office, it will be financedin principle by fees charged to applicants and inventors;    thiswill be supplemented in the build-up period by loancontributions from member states.     The United kingdom contribution to each source of income will be the same wherever the Office is located.      If the Office is here, the remittancecoming from abroad will be in general terms the whole expensesof the Office less our contribution.If the Office is abroad, the remittance going abroad will beroughly equal to our contribution.The gain to our balance of payments from having the Office herois therefore approximately the same as the expenses of the Office,currently estimated at approximately  9 million per annum.(These estimates assume that the Office^ budget will be thesame irrespective of its location).2      Operations oT private sectorIt is expected that for most patent applications, somenegotiations between the professional representatives and theOffice will be necessary at the Office itself.     For the mostpart this negotiation and filing of documents will be donethrough agents sited where the Office is and we think the resulting expenses could be at the very minimum  30 for eachcase.     The total could well be over  1.2 million per annum andthis will be attributable to London or Munich as the case may be.3      From 1 and 2 above, the net gain to our balance of payments from location here instead of abroad might be in the region of 10 million per annum, although no doubt some Salary and other payments would be remitted out of the United Kingdom.B      Savings to IndustryLocating the EPO in this country will reduce the cost of recruitingEnglish-speaking staff, and hence reduce the fees which have to bepaid by applicants.     British applicants will also find it cheaper tofile applications in this country than abroad.     These are minor butdirect savings which are hard to quantify.     There would also be substantial but unquantifiable advantages of convenience to industry from having the Office on the doorstep and from the certainty thatEnglish-language applications, were being dealt with by native Englishexaminers.c      Provision of Building1      capital to provide a building in Central London of about 400,000 sq ftgross could involve an outlay of about  40 million having regard
to the- coot of the ui.tr and cons I&quot;ruction, and to interestforegone prior to completion of the building.     To furnishand equip it might cost another  1 million.2       Rent subsidy to match the German offer, we might also have to be preparedto subsidise the rent of the building by foregoing part or all of it.     On a capital outlay of  40 million an appropriateinitial annual rent would be about  2-g- million for the first five years, on the usual basis of a long lease with provisionfor rent reassessment every 5 years.      It is not yet clear whatthe Germans intend to charge for the rent of their proposedMunich building, or indeed whether they intend to provide thebuilding and furnishings rent free;   but it must be assumed that whatever they charge will be well below  2^ million a year.A commercial rent of  2.20 per sq ft for new office accommodatLorin Munich is considered high.      If, as we understand, theBavarian State Government have allotted a site to the federal government for the use of the EPO at a peppercorn rent - as theydid for the German Patent Office - the rent paid for thebuilding might be as low as  1.50 per sq ft or  600,000 a year.On the other hand, if Munich building costs are similar tothose in London, and the EPO   pay full rent (free of site)their rent might be as much as  3 per sq ft or  1.2 million ayear.     The subsidy we might have to grant for London could thus be between  1.3 and  2.5.million a year for at least thefirst 5 years, if we are to match the German offer.3      To provide an Office on the outskirts of London would bemuch less expensive, perhaps half the cost, with a   much diminished need for subsidy.4 To provide an Office in Edinburgh a lesser capital outlayand consequentially lower rent would be indicated, involving a reduced subsidy.D      Effect of Grant of Fiscal PrivilegesThe main effect would be a loss of direct taxation revenue.     It is assumed that staffing with native language speakers in proportion tothe number of applications in the working languages will not be attained in practice.     Assuming 1,400 and 525 UK nationals of all ranks will be employed in the United Kingdom and Munichrespectively, 875 more people will be employed outside the UKtaxation system with location in the UK than with location in Munich.The average salary of an employee of the UK Patent Office is  2,200on which an average direct tax of about  300 would be payable.Thus the loss of direct taxation revenue to the Exchequer on locationin the UK would be rather over  250,000 per annum.E      Summary1      Locating the EPO in London would result in some gain tothe balance of payments.       This might amount to  10 million ayear.     There would also be some minor direct financial gainsto industry, substantial but unquantifiable benefits of convenience to industry and some unquantifiable indirecteconomic benefits.
2       A capital outlay of about  40 million would be involvedfor a site in central London, or less elsewhere.3       Rent subsidies and the Iojjs to the Exchequer from grantingfiscal privileges could range from  1.5 to  2.75 million ayear, depending on the assumptions made.
