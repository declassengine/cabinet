THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS government cp (72) 16 Copy No. 6214 February, 1972CABINETEARLY WARNING SYSTEMNote by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS)At the Cabinet discussion of our first, and experimental, early warning exercise the CPRS was invited to &quot; report again in sixmonths&apos; time when a comparison might be made between forecastand actuality &quot; (CM (71) 47th Conclusions). We were also instructedto subdivide the categories by broad subject heading which the chairmen of relevant Cabinet Committees might regularly review.2. Attached is a second list of expected major issues, in slightlychanged form, this time covering 1972. The aim, as before, is tooutline a landscape of events in relationship to one another, withina time scale; and thus to provide a basis for planning the government&apos;s strategy. On this occasion, we have not includeditems which would be of major importance if they occurred but which there is no positive reason to expect. The items listed areallocated to the appropriate Cabinet Committees.Retrospect3. Most of the developments of major significance which have occurred in the last six months were included by Departments intheir returns for our last Report. The major developments whichhave occurred and were not included were the rise in unemployment,difficulties over cotton textile import tariffs, over implementation ofthe &quot; six-day rule &quot; and pressure for annual pension uprating. Ofthe events and decisions which have not taken place in the second half of 1971, most now appear in the 1972 list.Prospect4. The CPRS believes that the following will be among themain issues in 1972, arising from the attached schedule, which will involve decisions related to the Governmenfs strategy and on which government should consider whether it will be adequately prepared:
I. Economic affairs(a) Too slow a decline in unemployment.(b) Inflation: excessive pay settlements in the private sector and thefuture of prices policy after the end of the CBI initiative.(c) Implications for industrial strategy and regional development of problems for &quot; declining &quot; and &quot; growth &quot; industries. the machine tool industry may present particular difficulty.id) Effective boycott of the Industrial Relations Act by the TUC.(e) Ordering of British economic objectives within the community and in trading relationships outside.II. Overseas affairs and defence(a) Preparation for the European summit.(b) European defence co-operation in the light of United Statesforce levels in Europe.(c) Forward decisions about defence policy and expenditure in the later 1970s.(d) International pressures on our policies in Northern Ireland.III. Home, social and environmental affairs(a) Long-term co-ordinated policy for children at risk, the elderlyand others in acute need of help.(b) Future policy towards higher education.(c) Industrial planning decisions highlighting the argument about&quot; progress &quot; versus &quot; conservation of the environment &quot;.IV. Role and style of Government(a) Definition of policy on devolution in the context of localgovernment and the regions.(b) Pressure on Government to explain its policies and to respond to the views of the public.Recommendation5.  We recommend:(i) that Ministers should consider whether these will be themain strategic issues next year; and(ii) that the Chairmen of Cabinet Committees should be invitedto consider what steps need to be taken, by way ofpreparatory discussion or contingency planning, to enablethe Government to deal With individual items and generaldevelopments in the context of the Governmenfs overallstrategy.Cabinet Office14 February, 1972.
