ANNEX ASTATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1972AMENDMENTS TO TEXT AGREED BY THE DEFENCE and oversea POLICY COMMITTEE ON TUESDAY25 JANUARY 1972CHAPTER I paragraph 2Delete last sentence.Paragraph 5In last sentence before &quot;threat&quot; insert &quot;potential&quot;Paragraph 16Insert following paragraph on Malta:&quot;16.      In response to a request from the Malta Government, Britain hasordered the withdrawal of British forces and associated personnel andtheir dependants, together with their stores and equipment.    Meanwhile,there have been discussions between Britain, members of NATO and theGovernment of Malta to see whether there might, nevertheless, be any basis for a satisfactory agreement providing for a continuing Britishpresence on the Island&quot;.Paragraph 21At end of paragraph insert:&quot;The Ministerial Aerospace Board proposed in Cmnd 4641 has now been set up, to ensure inter-Departmental co-ordination on civil aerospacepolicy&quot;.
Paragraph 28Revise as follows ,&quot;28.     The Defence Budget Estimates for 1972-73 total  2853 million andwill remain approximately 5-1 per cent of the gross national product.    at constant prices these Estimates are  60 million above the target published in &quot;Public Expenditure to 1975-76&quot; (Cmnd 4829).    Of this difference 4 million reflects the Defence share of measures to stimulate employmentannounced subsequently (mainly Nimrod aircraft).    The balance of thisexcess is attributable to the abolition of the Ministry of Defence and ministry of Aviation Supply Purchasing (Repayment) Service Votes (see annex B, Table 1, Note lb and Table 2) following the establishment of the procurement Executive, and the incorporation in the Defence budget estimates of amounts which would otherwise have been shown in theEstimates for the Purchasing (Repayment) Service Votes.    The Cmnd 4829target was calculated on the basis of the former convention, by which theDefence Budget was charged for Army and aerospace equipment ondelivery to the Services, progress and other payments to suppliers beingmade from the Purchasing (Repayment) Service Votes.    The present estimates have been calculated on the basis that all payments to supplierswill be made direct from Defence Votes, and they are higher than the comparable figure in Cmnd 4829 because the cost of aircraft and certainguided-weapons deliveries to the Services during 1972-73 is expected to beless than payments to suppliers for equipment which is due for delivery inthe next few years.    No net addition to public expenditure arises out of this change in Defence Budget conventions&quot;.V2

STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1972CHAPTER during the last year the Government has made good progress towards the broad objectives set out in the Supplementary statement on Defence Policy 1970 (Cmnd. h521).   There have been further improvements in the British contribution to NATO.   Outside europe the Five Power defence arrangements in Malaysia and Singapore havebeen established:    the transition to a new pattern of deploymenthas been smoothly carried out with the end of Far East Command atndthe withdrawal of forces from the Gulf.   There has been a substantial increase in the number of recruits for the Services,NORTHERN IRELAND2.    At home the Armed Forces have continued to be heavily engagedin Northern Ireland in the task of assisting the civil power in themaintenance of law and order.   The development in 1971 of the IRA&apos;campaing of violence and destruction has added a new and seriousdimension to that task.   Over the whole of that year, there were some 1,100 bomb outrages and over 1,700 terrorist shooting Incidents:U3 members of the regular Army and five of the Ulster DefenceRegiment were killed by terrorists.   The countering of terrorismrather than the prevention of inter-communal riots has become themain role of the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland.   They have madesubstantial progress in undermining the strength of the IRA.   During1971 the security forces uncovered 26 machine guns, 21+U rifles, 92shotguns and 2kk pistols and revolvers, together with other weapons,- 1 -
over 156,000 rounds of ammunition and over one-and-a-half tons of explosive.   On 31 December 1971 U83 persons were held under internmentand 180 under detention orders.3.     The Services are discharging their responsibilities withimpartiality and with exemplary fortitude and restraint.   They willremain in Northern Ireland for so long and in such strength as theyare needed.WESTERN security the Continuing Threath.     The Soviet Union is currently devoting about eight per cent of itsgross national product to defence, a proportion higher than that ofany NATO European country.   In the years ahead Soviet defence expenditure can be expected to rise by as much as five per cent perannum in real terms.   :The very large resources spent by the soviet union on military research and development will continue to ensurethat the Warsaw Pact countries are equipped with the most modemand sophisticated weapons systems.5.     The Soviet Union now has some 1,300 inter-continental ballisticmissiles, mainly the very powerful SS9 and the smaller but more numerous SS11, as well as some 700 medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles;   and its ballistic-missile firingsubmarines, of which there are now over 50, include increasing numbers of modern Polaris-type boats.   Soviet ground forces havebeen steadily expanding:   the current total of 155 divisions (towhich the other Warsaw Pact countries add about another 62) is higher than at any time in the last five years.   Although considerableSoviet forces are deployed against China, there has been no- 2 -
reduction in those facing NATO.   The effectiveness of the warsaw pact ground forces as a whole is &quot;being enhanced by improvements in command and control systems, armour, fire-power, air defence andmobility.   The total strength of Soviet military aircraft is nowsome 9,900:   new advanced aircraft will be widely deployed withtheir supporting systems to replace obsolete aircraft throughoutthe Warsaw Pact.   The Soviet navy is now a powerful, balanced and efficient force, strong both in its submarine arm and its surfacefleet.   Older units are being replaced progressively by modernwarships equipped with advanced weapons systems.   This potentialinstrument for war is widely deployed;   in the Mediterraneanespecially it has made a large contribution to the expansion of soviet political influence.   Deployments in the South Atlantic andthe Indian Ocean, posing a threat to vital Western trade routes,are becoming commonplace.The Alliance^ Response6,     East/West Negotiations     Western efforts to bring about a relaxation of tension in East/West relations continue.   In theirtalks on strategic arms limitations, the United States and theSoviet Union are currently concentrating on an agreement to limitanti-ballistic missile systems together with some limitations onoffensive systems.   There has been a belated and as yet impreciseresponse to not&apos;s invitation to the Warsaw Pact, first made atReykjavik in June 1968, to discuss mutual and balanced forcereductions.   On Berlin, the Quadripartite agreement was signed last september and the supplementary inner-German agreement in December.- 3 -
7. East/West negotiations are being and will continue to be conducted by the Warsaw Pact countries from positions of massiveand still growing military strength. The Western Alliance must,therefore, remain resolute in avoiding any premature lowering ofits guard: it must also insist that the imbalances in the forcesconfronting each other in Europe, which favour the Warsaw Pact,are taken fully into account in any negotiations on arms controller force reductions.8.     NATO Force Improvements   A wide range of improvements is beingmade to NATO forces in the areas to which the AD70 report gavepriority.   The European members of the Alliance, who provide thegreat bulk of not&apos;s conventional strength, are contributingsubstantially to those improvements both under the  hOOm five-year&quot;European Defence Improvement Programme&quot; and through continuingefforts in their individual defence programmes:   at current prices the total increase planned so far for 1972 in the defence budgetprovision of the &quot;Eurogroup&quot; countries is well over  hOOm.   TheUnited States is also&quot;planning major improvements in its conventional forces committed to the Alliance and the deployment of the Poseidonweapon system will enhance the effectiveness of the Westernstrategic deterrent.   These improvements are welcomej   but, as NATOMinisters acknowledged at their meetings in Brussels in December 1971.the need is for a continued and systematic improvement of not&apos;sconventional forces and for the maintenance of adequate tacticaland strategic nuclear forces in order to ensure that the deterrentremains effective at all levels.J).    European Defence co-operation   Within the Western Alliance theWBCONFIDENTIAL
European countries should seek to co-operate more closely on defence and to establish a greater identity of view.   In keeping with thesum of its resources, Europe needs both to exert more influence onthe major issues affecting Western security and to assume increasedresponsibility for its own defence.   There is also continuing pressure on all European governments to make the most effective use of the limited resources available for defence.   Bilateral staff talks,collaborative projects for arms procurement and the practicalactivities of the Eurogroup are already making important contributions.But it will be necessary to extend existing forms of co-operationboth in scope and depth- if Europers needs are to be met.   Thatprocess should be facilitated by the growing European unity symbolisedby agreement on the enlargement of the European Economic Community.BRITAINfS CONTRIBUTIONForce Improvements10.   Soon after taking office in June 1970, the Government decided on the number of major improvements to britain&apos;s Armed Forces.These were announced in the Supplementary Statement on defence policy 1970 and included the retention of the Ark Royal, theexpansion of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, the retentionof the Brigade of Gurkhas and the provision of additional Jaguarfront-line squadrons.   The following additional major improvements have been decided on this year:Royal Navy - acceleration of the Naval construction programme with orders for two Type i+2destroyers, four Type 21 frigates and anumber of support vessels and smaller craftj- 5 -
Army - the restoration of four infantry &quot;battalionsbased on the representative companies of units previously scheduled for disbandmentor amalgamation;Royal Air Force - orders for additional Buccaneer /&quot;and Nimrod^aircraft.NATO11.   The main beneficiary of these force improvements will be NATOto which virtually the whole of the Royal Navy, most of the combatunits of the Army and the majority of the combat aircraft of theRoyal Air Force are committed.   The improvements will contribute substantially to the programme of European defence improvementsannounced by the Eurogroup of Defence Ministers at their meeting,under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Defence, in brussels in December 1971.   They are in addition to Britain1scontribution, under the &quot;European Defence Improvement Programme&quot;,to the cost of special infrastructure arrangements for NATO&apos;saircraft shelter programme.12.   Britain has from its;inception taken a leading part in theactivities of the Eurogroup, including its specialised sub-groups which are exploring the possibilities of closer European co-operation in logistics, communications, training, medical facilities andarms procurement.   Regular bilateral staff talks are also held between britain and seven European allies.   Britain is collaborating withother-European countries in a growing number of equipment projects.Outside Europe13.   The Five Power defence arrangements in Malaysia and Singapore- 6 -
agreed at the Ministerial meeting in London in April 1971 came intoeffect on 1 November, when the Commander-in-Chief Far East was withdrawn and the Commander of the ANZUK force in Malaysia and singapore assumed command of Australian, British and New Zealandforces assigned to him.   The arrangements include an integrated air defence system.   Details of the British contribution to those forces are given in Chapter II.1h.   A continuing British maritime presence in the Indian Oceanhelps to maintain vigilance in that area of strategic importance.In the G-ulf, Britain&apos;s exclusive treaties have been terminated and   ,new treaties of friendship signed with Bahrain, Qatar and the united arab Emirates which were formally established on 2 December 1971.All British resident forces have been withdrawn, but ships of theRoyal Navy and Royal Air Force aircraft will visit the Gulfregularly.   The Trucial Oman Scouts have been transferred to theUnited Arab Emirates to form the basis of their defence forces.The loan of British military personnel to local defence forces willcontinue.   A small British military team has been stationed atSharjah to give advice to local defence forces and to supportBritish Army units visiting the G-ulf area for training and exercises.15.   Details of Britain&apos;s other commitments outside Europe are givenin Chapter II,MALTA/&quot;l6.   Up-dated situation report to be circulated.^MANPOWERThe Services17.   In the past year there has been a strong upsurge in recruitment.- 7 -
Nearly 39,000 male other ranks were enlisted in 1970-71;   for1971-72, if current trends are maintained, the figure will he inthe region of /&quot;k5,OOOj7, an increase of  &quot; 60 per cent? over thelow point of 1968-69.   Recruitment of officers has also improved..18.   The prospective decline in the number of young men in the recruiting age-group who are available for employment will makeit difficult to maintain recruitment at the level which has nowbeen achieved.   /&quot;The forthcoming raising of the school-leaving age to 16 will accentuate that problem.^   A new form of engagement forother ranks of all three Services will be introduced this year,under which recruits will be committed for only a minimum period of productive service (about three years), and subject to that minimummay leave at any time; at 18 months&apos; notice.   It is hoped that the flexibility of the new system will both stimulate recruitment and encourage men to stay longer with the Forces.   Details of this measure and of other improvements in conditions of service aregiven in Chapter IV.Civilian Staff19.   The number of civilian staff attributable to the Ministry ofDefence was raised by some 28,000 to about 3hh,000 when theMinistry of Aviation Supply was dissolved on 1 May 1971 and responsibility for its defence activities was transferred to theMinistry of Defence.20.   The total number of civilian staff employed by the Ministryof Defence on 1 April 1972 is expected to be about /&quot;326,O00-J7.   .This represents a reduction in comparable civilian staff numbersof /&quot;18,000,7 since 1 Ap?il 1971.- 8 -
DEFENCE ORGANISATIONHeadquarters Organisation21.   As foreshadowed in the White Paper on &quot;Government organisation for Defence Procurement and Civil Aerospace&quot; (Cmnd. U6h1) a new organisation, the Procurement Executive, was set up on 2 August 1971to combine the Defence procurement responsibilities of the Ministryof Defence and the former Ministry of Aviation Supply.   The aim ofthe new Executive is to establish a coherent organisation to tackle the whole range of problems inherent in the development and production, within the resources expected to be made available,of equipment for the Services including many complex systems whichcall for research into new areas of technology.22.   Under the Chief Executive (Mr. Derek Rayner) there are nowfour Systems Controllers responsible for development and production,one in each of the main areas (land, sea and air systems, andguided-weapons) and from 1 April 1972 each will be an AccountingOfficer for his own area.   There are three additional Controllersfor Policy, Personnel, and Research and Development establishments and Research.   There is also the Head of Defence Sales who reports on certain aspects of his work to the Permanent Under-Secretary ofState as well as to the Chief Executive.23.   As a further step in the reorganisation, a series of studieshas been initiated into the scope for rationalisation within theMinistry of Defence Research and Development Establishments.   the aim of these studies, which wiil also cover the Atomic WeaponsResearch Establishment, will be to achieve the optimum economycommensurate with efficiency and flexibility in the use of theresources available within those Establishments.
2h.   Special attention is being paid to the need to maintain anadequate industrial base for the future procurement programme,and to strengthen relationships with Defence suppliers.   TheNational Defence Industries Council already provides for consultations at high level between Government and industry, andit is intended to expand this consultative machinery at appropriatelevels to embrace presentations to industry by the Services on future equipment plans, Joint symposia on specialised technologicalareas and ad hoc groups to examine particular aspects of procurementpolicy.25.   Elsewhere the committee under the chairmanship ofthe Permanent Under-Secretary of State has continuedits examination of the organisation of the Ministry of Defence.   Ithas surveyed most of the major areas of work in the Department andits findings have contributed to the continuing effort to decentralisework and the associated staff from London to the provinces, tostreamline the conduct of business and to save staff.   The committeeis at present studying the use of management techniques in theMinistry of Defence and in particular the further development of theDepartments automatic data processing systems. 26.   In line with one of the principal recommendations of the InterimReport of the Committee on Government Industrial Establishmentschaired by Sir John Mallabar (Cmnd. 4713), it has been decided thatthe Royal Ordnance Factories shall continue as an integral part ofthe Ministry of Defence in the Procurement Executive.   Details of changes which will be introduced into the organisation and operationof the Royal Ordnance Factories are given in Chapter V,/Command Structure27,   A single Royal Air Force operational Command is to be set upby the end of 1972 for the whole of the United Kingdom, formed- 10 -CONFIDENTIAL   -
from the main elements of Strike and Air Support Commands. Thisreorganisation, which will bring the Royal Air Force command organisation into line with changes already announced in the royal navy and the Army, will ensure the most effective use of the RoyalAir Force&apos;s multi-role front-line in the United Kingdom, provide asingle point of contact in the United Kingdom at Air Commander-in-chief level with NATO and lead to manpower and financial economies.THE DEFENCE BUDGET28.   The Defence Budget Estimates for 1972-73 total   /&quot;      J?mand will be approximately        J per cent of the gross national product.   At constant prices these Estimates are   /Z      Jr&amp; abovethe target published in &quot;Public Expenditure to 1975-76&quot; (Cmnd. h829)This excess is attributable to the abolition of the Ministry ofDefence and Ministry of Aviation Supply Purchasing (Repayment)Services Votes (see Annex B, Table 1, Note 1b) following theestablishment of the Procurement Executive.   The Cmnd, h829 targetwas calculated on the basis of the former convention, by which theDefence Budget was charged for Army and aerospace equipment ondelivery, payments to suppliers being made from the Purchasing(Repayment) services Votes.   The present Estimates: have been calculated on the basis that payments to suppliers will be madedirect from Defence Votes, and they are higher than the comparablefigure in Cmnd. h 29 because deliveries of aircraft and certainguided weapons during \ 972-73 are expected to be low, whereaspayments for equipment which is due for delivery in quantity inthe next few years are building up.
IICOMBAT FORCESDEPLOYMENT operations and EXERCISESCOMBAT FORCES AND DEPLOYMENT1.     The Combat Forces consist of:(a) The Nuclear Strategic Force;(b) Royal Navy General Purpose Combat Forces;(c) European Theatre Ground Forces;(d) Other Army Combat Forces;(e) Royal Air Force General Purpose Combat Forces;(f) Air Mobility Forces.2.     The cost and Service and civilian manpower of these forces are shown at Annex &apos;JT J *3. An illustrative outline deployment of the Combat Forces earlyin 1972 is shown at Annex   J7.NUCLEAR STRATEGIC FORCEk*     The Polaris submarines Resolution. Repulse. Renown and Revengeprovide a continuous patrol as the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution tothe Western strategic deterrent.   The first Polaris refit ofResolution is being followed by that of Repulse.ROYAL NAVY GENERAL PURPOSE COMBAT FORCES5.    All HM Ships forces now come under the Commander-in-Chief,Fleet, whose Headquarters are at Northwobd.   All major ships andthe amphibious forces are earmarked for assignment in war to NATO:they are deployed world-wide as NATO, other allied or national interests require.- 12 -
Naval forces deployed! overseas are as follow:(a)   East of Suez   Destroyers and frigates carry outthe Navy&apos;s overseas tasks on a rotational basis.A force of six ships will be on station East of suez contributing to the Five Power defence arrangements and the ANZTJK Force, visiting theGulf, maintaining the Beira Patrol and a guard-ship at Hong Kong and providing a presence inthe Indian Ocean and South East Asia areas.   other ships deployed in the area will include patrol vessels for maritime policing duties at Hong Kong,Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and later in the year a submarine serving with the Royal Australian Navy.It is expected that larger ships, such as a cruiser,will also visit the area occasionally. .(Jo)   The Mediterranean   A guided-missile destroyer andtwo frigates earmarked for assignment to SACEURoare stationed in the Mediterranean (one ship inthe vicinity of Gibraltar), backed from time totime by larger units such as HMS Ark Royal andamphibious ships with Royal Marines Commandosembarked.   Other destroyers, frigates, submarines and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries also deploy periodicallyto the Mediterranean.   The Royal Navy contributesto NATO!s Naval On Call Force Mediterranean,    &quot;kRoyal&apos;Marines Commando is deployed in Malta.^- 13 -
(c) West Indies   Two helicopter carrying-frigates, one with a detachment of Royal Marines, are stationed in the West Indies.   These ships are augmentedoccasionally by other units for exercises andtrials.(d) South Atlantic   The Ice Patrol ship HMS Endurancehas deployed to the Antarctic for the summer seasonin support of the British Antarctic Survey and forhydrographic surveys.   A Royal Marines detachmentequipped with a hovercraft is based on the falkland islands.(e) Other deployments   The Royal Navy maintains fishery protection patrols in the North Atlantic and homeareas with frigates and mine countermeasures vessels.Fishery protection round the coasts of the UnitedKingdom will be strengthened in the latter partof 1972 by redeploying MCMV effort,by employinga fast patrol boat on the task and by havinghelicopters more readily available to augment shippatrols.   The Royal Navy is providing in turn afrigate and a guided-missile destroyer for the NATOStanding Naval Force Atlantic.SHIPS AND EQUIPMENT7.     The following developments are in train or likely to be putin train during the year:(a)   New Construction(1)   New Designs-   A further contract with the lead shipbuilders- 14 -
(Messrs Vickers) is being placed to coverall the remaining preparatory work on the design of the through-deck   cruiser.   Workcontinues on the design of improved classesof submarine, general purpose frigate andmine countermeasures vessel.Nuclear Powered Fleet Submarines&quot;&quot;&quot;-------- The seventh to be accepted into service.Eighth, ninth and tenth building.   Eleventhto be ordered.Destroyers and Frigates- HMS Bristol will be accepted into service.- Six Type h2 destroyers are now undericonstruction.   It is planned to place afurther order during the year.- Eight Type 21 Frigates (including HMS Amazonthe first of the Class) are under constructionHMS Ariadne (the last Leander Class frigate)to be accepted into service.Other Ships-- A minehunter, constructed in glass-reinforcedplastic, to be accepted   into service.- A survey ship, two fleet replenishment ships,two small fleet tankers, one experimentalship and two salvage vessels are tinderconstruction.   A fast patrol boat is being acquired and four patrol craft will be ordered during the year.
Conversions and Equipment Deployments(1)   Major Units- The conversion of HMS Tiger to a helicoptercarrying role to he completed and the conversion of HMS Hermes to the commandoship role to continue.(2)   Frigates- HMS Leander to complete her special refitas the first of her class to carry Ikara.VSTOL Aircraft- The trials carried out from HMS Ark Royalduring the past year have shown that VSTOLaircraft can be operated effectively from a ship&apos;s deck and that there are no techincal or logistic reasons why VSTOL aircraft shouldnot be considered suitable for deployment at sea.   The present versions of the Harrier,however, including the version very successfullyadopted for the United States Marine Corps,have been designed for close support of ground operations.   No VSTOL aircraft atpresent exists with the capabilityfor maritime operations.   Employment ofVSTOL aircraft in an embarked role would,therefore, require a considerable degree ofdevelopment.   The courses open include the design of a new aircraft or the developmentof the operational capability of theexisting Harrier for deployment at sea.- 16 -
The former would give a better performancebut would cost more and require a longer period of development.   These options arenow being studied in relation to effective-ness, timing and cost, and to otherpriorities.   They are being pressedvigorously forward;   but, in view of the potential complexity and cost of the work involved, careful examination of all the issues will be needed before decisions are taken,Helicopters- Sea King, Wasp and Wessex helicopters arewidely deployed at sea.   Development of Lynxto continue.Equipment(1)   Exocet- Contracts have been signed for the purchaseof Exocet missiles.   The first ship equip-ment to be delivered during the year.(2)   Mark U6 Torpedo- Arrangements have been made to purchase anumber of Mark U6 lightweight torpedoesfrom the United States.- 17 -
EUROPEAN THEATRE GROUND FORCESBritish Army of the Rhine (BAOR)8.     BAOR is a key element in the United Kingdom&apos;s contributionto the NATO alliance.-.   Its peacetime strength could be more than doubled on mobilisation.The Berlin Brigade9.     This independent brigade fulfils Britain&apos;s commitment tothe security of the Western Sector of Berlin.Forces in the United Kingdom10.   Headquarters United Kingdom Land Forces will form on 1 April1972 when all Army units in the United Kingdom will come under its command.   Headquarters Southern Command and Army StrategicCommand will close on the same day.   Headquarters Western Commandwill close on 1 August 1972 and Headquarters Northern Command on31 December 1972.11.   The following forces have primary roles in support of NATO:(a) the land elements of the United Kingdom MobileForce;(b) the British contribution to the Allied CommandEurope. Mobile Force (Land) j(c) the Special Air Service Regiment.OTHER ARMY COMBAT FORCES12.   This category comprises land forces stationed abroad to- 18 -

OPERATIONS AND EXERCISESNORTHERN IRELAND17.   Early in February 1971 the Northern Ireland situationentered a new and more serious phase with the increasing use by the IRA of firearms against the Army.   On 6 February the firstsoldier was killed.   From then until the beginning of August their  campaign of violence and destruction increased in intensity.The number of bomb outrages rose from 16 in January to 68 inJuly, and terrorist shooting incidents from four in January to78 in July including firing from fast-moving cars and from behinda screen of rioters on children.   Inter-communal riots, such asthat in Belfast at Easter, still occurred but were no longer themain security problem.18,   The increasing toil of death and destruction caused by their , the mounting threat to the economy, and the difficulty ofsecuring convictions in the face of intimidation of witnesses,made it necessary for the Northern Ireland Government to invoke,on 9 August 1971, their powers of detention and internment underthe Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts (Northern Ireland),Sines then the Army has been engaged in a continuous struggle against the IRA whose campaign was intensified immediately afterinternment.   Gradually, however, the security forces were ableto make inroads into the strength of the IRA, mainly by exploit-ing information obtained from those arrested, whioh led to furtherarrests and to successful searches for arms.   Control of the border with the&apos; Irish Republic was tightened, and a number of roads across it were blocked in order to hinder illegal traffic.
19.   A Committee of Inquiry under the chairmanship of Sir EdmundCompton was appointed to investigate allegations of physicalbrutality to those arrested on 9 August while in the custody ofthe Security Forces prior to being released, charged, or lodgedin a place specified in a detention order.   The Inquiry concluded that none of the complainants had suffered physical brutality,but that of the 3U2 men arrested on that day 19 had suffered ameasure of ill-treatment.   The majority of the findings of ill-treatment related to methods used in support of the interrogationin depth of a small number of detainees.   At the request of theGovernment the Privy Councillors Lord Parker of Waddington,Lord Gardiner and Mr John Boyd-Carpenter M.P., are examining the procedures currently authorised for the interrogation, and custodywhile subject to interrogation, of persons suspected of terrorism.20.   The force level, which has included Royal Marine Commandosand elements of the Royal Air Force Regiment, has varied accordingto the needs of the situation.   The number of major units in the infantry role was eight in January 1971 and reached a maximum for1971 of 17 In August.   The forces in Northern Ireland on 31 December1971 Included 16 major units in the Infantry role, of which fivewere redeployed from BAOR.21.   HM Ships have mounted patrols off the Northern Ireland coastin support of security operations and the Royal Air Force providesair transport support, including helicopters.22.   The Queen has approved that recommendations may be made forthe full range of military operational awards for valour and- 25 -
distinguished service in Northern Ireland, and also the award ofthe General Service Medal 1962 with clasp &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; for service in Northern Ireland since 1k August 1969.THE NATO AREAOPERATIONSSurveillance and Interception23.    Ships of the Fleet and Nimrod long-range maritime reconnais-sance aircraft monitor the movement of Soviet naval forces operating in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean.   Royal Air Force air defence aircraft, supported by tankers, intercept all unidentifiedaircraft approaching our shores.Other Tasks2h.   Minehunters have been involved in the location and retrievalof aircraft lost at sea and in support of the missile development programme.   Hydrographic Survey Ships continue to help provide theinformation on which the unrivalled authority of British AdmiraltyCharts is founded.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY25.   Royal Engineers laid the foundation for an automaticnavigation light on the island of Rockall and geologists from the institute of Geological Studies made their first survey of the island when the RFA Engadine paid a visit.   The Royal Engineershave carried out several other tasks in Scotland including theconstruction of an airfield on the Isle of Skye.   The Royal AirForce has provided aeromedical evacuation flights and both theRoyal Navy and the Royal Air Force search and rescue facilities.As a result of ship accidents in the Channel and the Southern- 26 -
North Sea early in 1971, and to cater for the needs of deeperdraught merchant ships, HM Survey Ships have been engagedthroughout the year in a series of surveys to ensure safety ofshipping around the recent wrecks and along the proposed newdeep draught routes.26.   Naval and amphibious forces and aircraft of the RAF took part in five NATO maritime exercises.   These included aircraft carrier operations on the northern flank and participation byamphibious ships, with their Royal Marines Commandos and helicopters-copters embarked, in a NATO amphibious exercise in the Mediter-ranean.   There has also been a full programme of nationalexercises which have included carrier operations in the Mediter-ranean and Western Atlantic and amphibious training in the Arctic.Surface ship, submarine and mine countermeasures training hasbeen carried out (involving Royal Naval Reserves) and the royal navy has continued to provide a substantial proportion of thesubmarine contribution to NATO.    In December 1971 a major royal navy/Royal Air Force exercise was carried out in United Kingdomwaters to develop joint procedures for the participation of land-based aircraft in maritime operations.   Royal Navy helicopters wonthe Henri Durant Air ^Sea Rescue Trophy last June, in competition with teams from seven NATO countries.27.   Normal training for BAOR units continued in Germany and othercountries, and Army units assigned to the Allied Command EuropeMobile Force and Royal Air, Force aircraft practised their role inexercises held in Norway and Thrace.- 27 -
28.    Aircraft of the United Kingdom Air Defence Region took partin 26 NATO exercises and were represented in the AFCENT air defence competition in which they came first, winning both theHudleston and Burniaux trophies.   Home-based air defence andoffensive support squadrons, supported by Royal Air Force transport aircraft, have carried out exchange visits with squadrons fromother NATO countries.    Strike Command aircraft took part in eightNATO maritime exercises.    Exercise activity included simulatedstrikes by Vulcans and Buccaneers, tactical and long-range mari-time reconnaissance and air defence.   Victor tankers flew insupport of the air defence and maritime strike aircraft.29.    Throughout the year RAF Germany regularly participated in nato exercises in Europe and with the French Armed Forces.   Withthe new generation of aircraft now in squadron service more train-ing time was given to conventional warfare in conjunction with theground forces.&apos;   THE.REST OF THE WORLDOPERATIONSEvacuation of East Pakistan1130.

The Sultan of Oman&apos;s Armed Forces, which include loanpersonnel from the Royal Marines, British Army and and Royal Air-Force, have been engaged in operations in the Dhofar, the SouthWest province of Omah.    Certain Royal Artillery and Royal AirForce Regiment personnel have been temporarily deployed to assistthe Royal Air Force detachment at Salalah in the defence of the airfield against rebel attacks.Hong Kong3h.   HM Ships carry out guardship and patrol duties in the Colonythroughout the year.   Visits have also been made by HM ShipsEagle. Albion. Intrepid, Triumph and Glamorgan.    The garrisonsupported by Royal Air Force helicopters, continued to be avail-able to assist the Civil authorities in maintaining the securityof the Colony.   Regular visits were made to Hong Kong by RoyalAir Force aircraft.The Caribbean ;35. The Bahamas Patrol is carried out by frigates supplemented by reconnaissance flights by Air Support Command.   The frigates
have also contributed to disaster relief activities.   The RoyalEngineer force in Anguilla was withdrawn in September 1971using Royal Air Force Hercules aircraft.Beira Patrol36.   HM Ships, supported by Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and RoyalAir Force reconnaissance aircraft have patrolled the East african coast off the port of Beira in enforcement of the United NationsResolution.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY37.    Sea Rescues   In October, HMS Eagle rescued the crew of theAmerican freighter &quot;Steel Vendor&quot; by helicopter in the South China,Sea.    Earlier, in June, the Survey Ships Bulldog and Beaglerescued the crews of two fishing vessels aground in the indian ocean.East Pakistan Refugees in Bengal38.   Royal Air Force aircraft ferried relief supplies from theUnited Kingdom and Switzerland on behalf of the World health organisation and United Kingdom Charities, as part of the inter-national programme to give assistance to the refugees in Bengal.Medical supplies, a mobile clinic, marquees and food were flowninto the area during July and August 1971.Insurrection in Ceylon39.    Six helicopters, arms and ammunition supplied by the UnitedStates Government were delivered by Royal Air Force aircraft tothe Ceylon Government during the insurrection in April 1971.Royal EngineerskQ.   The Royal Engineers have carried out development projects in

During the year British forces helped to plan and took partin the annual CENTO and SEATO exercises.   Royal Marines Commandoscompanies with helicopter support have exercised in the Bahamason two occasions.   Army units took part in small scale exercisesin Fiji, Australia and West Malaysia, and carried out reciprocalexercises in Jamaica and Ghana.     Infantry and Engineer units have exercised in Kenya.   The Army team won the annual CENTOsmall arms competition (Nishan VIII) with a record score.   aircraft from Strike Command flew two reinforcement exercises to the far east during the year.    Ships of the Royal Navy have exercisedduring the year with the Dominican, South African, Spanish andVenezuelan navies.- 31 -
IIIRESERVE AND AUXILIARY forces.     The Reserve and Auxiliary Forces have a vital role in the defence of the country:   they supplement the regular Forcesin time of war or emergency with trained men and women ableimmediately to take their places in the Armed Services, some informed units, others as individual reinforcements.2.     The current strengths of the Reserve and Cadet Forces andthe Ulster Defence Regiment are shown in Annex A, Table 6.   Theirestimated cost is shown in Annex  &quot; j.ARMY RESERVE AND AUXILIARY FORCES3.     The Army Reserves comprise the regular Reserves, the ArmyGeneral Reserve consisting of certain ex-National Servicemen, andthe Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).4.     The expansion of the TAVR by a new armoured car regimentand 20 infantry-type units has now taken place.   many members of the new units were able to attend annual camp in the summer and a high standard of training and efficiency has alreadybeen achieved.   The total strength of the TAVR rose from49*800 to  &quot;        j between March and December 1971.   There hasbeen a steady increase in the strength of the existing units.THE ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT5.    When it was formed in January 1970 the Regiment was organised in seven battalions, one in each county   and one in Belfast, withan establishment ceiling of 6,000,   During the first half of 1971the strength of the Regiment remained steady at around 4*200.- 32 -
Following a significant increase in the rate of recruitment inAugust, It was decided to raise the establishment ceiling from6,000 to 10,000.   Three new battalions (in Tyrone, Antrim andBelfast) have since been formed by splitting existing battalionsinto two, and as numbers have increased additional companies andplatoons have been formed, making it easier for men to be allotted duties near their homes.   The upper age limit for recruits without previous police or Army experience was raised from kO to 50;   special arrangements were made to ensure that members of the TAVR in Northern Ireland who wished to resignin order to join the Ulster Defence Regiment could retain the option of subsequently rejoining the TAVR.   All these measures were undertaken without any alteration in the fundamental role of the regiment and without lowering its high standards of training,equipment and discipline.   At 1 January 1972 the strength was  j.6. For two periods during 1971 totalling five weeks the Regimentwas called out for extended service.   There was an outstandingresponse to this call.   Apart from these two special efforts the regiment has also continued to carry on its nightly and weekendduties of patrolling the &quot;border 9 manning road checks, and guardingkey points.ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES RESERVE FORCES7.    These consist of the regular Reserves (i.e. ex-regular royal navy or Royal Marines officers and men), including in particular the Royal Fleet Reserve of approximately 5*000 ratings who have
recent experience of active service, and the volunteer Reserves,(i.e. the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve and theWomen1s Royal Naval Reserve totalling about 3tk00 officers and , 700 ratings and other ranks).8.     The Royal Naval Reserve Divisions man eleven minesweeperswhich take part in NATO and national exercises and contribute tothe country&apos;s minesweeping effort in home waters.   The Royal naval reserve also provides support in maritime and other headquartersfor various tasks such as communications and naval control of-shipping.   The Royal Marines Reserve reinforces the regular Corps,in particular the Royal Marines Commandos.     All volunteer Reservestrain throughout the year.9.     A review of Reserve requirements concluded last year that,apart from the need for a small increase to the Royal MarinesReserve, the Navy&apos;s Reserves were adequate under full mobilisa-tion conditions.   Attention is being given to the current arrange-ments for their recall and it has been decided as from the beginningof 1972 to activate a special class of the Royal Fleet Reserve, whowill have the same liabilities to recall as their counterparts inthe Army.ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE FORCES10.   The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of the Regular andVolunteer Reserves and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.   A review ofthe adequacy of the reserves has confirmed the present policy ofmaintaining only a small paid Reserve, but the possibility of someexpansion of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force to fill additional
support roles is being considered.CADET FORCES11.   The Cadet Forces continue to make an important contributionto regular recruitment.   Most of the accepted recommendations ofthe Review Committee on the Army Cadet Force have now been putinto effect.- 35 -
CONFIDENTIALIVMANPOWER AND CONDITIONS OF service the OUTLOOK FOR MANPOWER1.     The Government inherited a situation in which the declinein the strength of the Forces had run far ahead of the reductionsplanned by the previous Administration.   This was largely dueto a serious drop in recruitment which, apart from its effect ontotal numbers, had unbalanced the age and rank structure of theServices.2.     The first task of the Government was to reverse the manpowerdecline.   This has been done.   Over the past year there has beena striking upsurge in recruitment, both of officers and of other ranks.   The Services expect to recruit a total of  &quot;       j maleother ranks in the financial year 1971-72, compared with 38,900recruited in 1970-71 (see Annex A, Table U).   The numbers of servicemen prolonging their Service are also increasing.   Thestrength of the Forces is currently in reasonable balance withrequirements, though there are still shortages in some branchesand trades.3.    Recruiting trends over the last two years are shown in the table below.
MALE OTHER RANK RECRUITING - 12-month moving annual totalsALL^SERVIOESh.     The long-term problem is by no means solved.   The numberof males who are both in the age-zone from which other ranksare recruited, and actually available for employment, has declinedin recent years and will remain below the present levels for therest of the decade.- 37 -
50     The Immediate effect of the raising of the school-leaving age will he felt in a sharp reduction in the number of school-leavers in the spring and summer of 1973, and hencein the numbers available for recruitment in the financialyear 1973-74.   The place of 15-year r-olds in the presentpattern of recruitment is shown in the diagram belowt    Inthe longer term the key question is whether the services can meet their manning needs by increased recruiting at 16,17 and higher ages and by retaining men for longer periods.MALE OTHER RANKS ENLISTED IN FINANCIAL YEAR 1970-71, ANALYSED BY age at THE TIME OF ENLISTINGj
CONDITIONS OF SERVICEGeneral6.     During the year conditions of service in the Armed forces have been widely reviewed.   Several major improvements and manyminor ones have been made and others are in prospect, including:Major Improvements(1)     Pay(2)     Local Overseas Allowance(3)     Pensions(h)     The &quot;notice engagement&quot;.Improvements for Troops in Northern Ireland(5)     Concessionary air fares(6)     Other travel concessions(7)     Refrigerators for married quarters(8)     Improved and cheaper facilities for telephonecalls from boxes in Army camps(9)     Travelling libraries and fish and chip vans(10)     TV sets and film projectors(11)     Free issue of British national newspapers(12)     Central Welfare Agency staffed by the Women&apos;royal Voluntary Service/(13)     Financial help for welfare transport(14)     Refund of cost of storing furniture elsewhere inthe United Kingdom (for Servicemen on normal tours)- 39 -
Other Minor Improvements(15)   Local leave scheme for servicemen in Hong Kong.7.     A seven per cent interim pay award effective from 1 August1971 was received by all&apos;members of the Armed Forces exceptsenior officers in the ranks of Major-General (and equivalent)and above and medical and dental officers.   A biennial reviewof pay is due in April 1972 and the Armed Forces Pay review body plans to submit a substantive report by that date.   The ratesof various types of additional pay and allowances and the charges for food and accommodation are also being reviewed, not only to adjust the rates from April 1972 where desirable but also to simplify the regulations wherever practicable.   Rates of pay of major-Generals (and equivalent) and above were increased dlt1 January 1971, although half the increases were foregone for sixmonths by officers in the ranks of General (and equivalent)and above.   The pay of senior officers is being reviewedseparately by the Top Salaries Review Body.   Medical and dentalofficers1 pay has been increased in line with the pay of general medical practitioners recommended last December by the Doctors1and Dentists&apos; Review Body, who are carrying out a further reviewof the rates of remuneration to be paid from April 1972.8.    Local Overseas: Allowance.   Servicemen overseas are compensated for the essential extra cost of living by means of local overseasallowance.   The methods used for assessing the allowances havebeen reviewed and recast, and the resulting system is more accurate.- Up -
- M -Revised rates of local overseas allowance have now heen introduced in the major theatres, together with rent allowances whereappropriate9.     Pensionso   Provision has heen made for the purchasing powerof pensions to he restored and maintained for eligible pensioners,and the qualifying age for these increases is to he reduced from 60to 55 from 1 December 1972.   For Servicemen yet to retire the structure of retired pay and pensions is being examined to ensureit is in line with up-to-date pensions practice.10.   Northern Ireland.   In addition to the measures listed inparagraph 6 above, substantial and rapid progress has been madeby the Department of the Environment in improving the temporary accommodation which the troops have to occupy for operational reasons.   An additional sum of  500,000 made available last november has been allocated to improving unit canteens, cleaningup and partitioning living accommodation, providing washingmachines, building the troops a swimming pool in the Belfast area,and a variety of other measures chosen at the discretion of local commanders.   Of special help to the troops is a scheme to facilitatehome visits and reduce family separation, by introducing concessionaryrates of air travel for men on emergency tours.   The concessionis available once each tour and applies to journeys between northern Ireland and 16 airports in other &quot;parts-of the UK.Fares are substantially reduced, the highest being  2.95 return.
ENGAGEMENTS POLICYr11.   The popularity of shorter engagements has been confirmed by experience over the past year.   From the services point of view,however, they carry the disadvantage that more recruits must beenlisted, and a larger and costlier training programme maintained,to support forces of any given strength.    It is therefore essential, particularly at a time when the catchment area isshrinking, to make prolongation of service more attractive.12,   During the past year the Services have undertaken a fundamentalreview of their engagement structures for other ranks, taking intoaccount the changes announced by the Government following theDonaldson Report (Cmnd. h509) and put into effect on 1 April 1971.These gave to boys enlisted below the age of 17^ the right to shorten their engagements on reaching 18.   For the period 1 April -  30 November   j 1971 the proportions of those eligible to shortentheir engagements who actually did so were as follows:Royal Navy 29 per cent JJRoyal Marines  &quot;16 per cent jArmy Z&quot;3k per cent jRoyal Air Force ^f*10 per cent jAll Services ^ 25 per cent jThe remainder confirmed the engagements on which they had originallyenlisted. These figures, based on only a few months&apos; data, are onlyearly indications, but they do serve to confirm that the great
majority of Servicemen who enlist as boys are well content withtheir choice of career.13.   The main conclusion to emerge from the review is that theServices&apos; engagement structures need to be made more flexible.Under the present rules the boy or man who enlists or re-engagesmust accept a firm commitment for a fixed period of years.   Formany this arrangement is perfectly acceptable.   Others, however,may jib at the restriction of personal choice inherent in such asystem, and thus be deterred from enlisting or prolonging.1h.   A system of flexible engagements has been devised which will apply both to those who enlist as adult Servicemen andto those who mature from boy&apos;s service.   The Services will apply the scheme to their adult intake in  different waysdepending on the length and type of training the individual receives,but basically it gives the Serviceman the right, on completion oftraining and after l  years&apos; productive service, to give 18 monthsnotice of leaving.   The &quot;notice engagement&quot;, as it will be called,will be introduced on 1 May 1972, being offered as an initialengagement to adult recruits and applying also, in a modified form,to the Women1s Services.   Existing long-term engagements, rewardedby higher scales of pay, will continue for the benefit of those whoprefer them;   but some of the shorter engagements will be superseded.Recruits below the age of 17^ will Continue to enlist on existingterms, but on reaching the age of 18 they will be invited to choose between confirming their original engagement and converting to the&quot;notice engagement&quot;.   Also with effect from May 1, all men and women- U3 -
who have served for nine years or more will he granted a similarright to leave the Service at 18 months notice.15.   As the Donaldson Committee recognised, service in the armed forces must always involve commitment, since otherwise it wouldhe impossible to ensure the maintenance of balanced and efficientforces of the size required to meet national defence policy.   Forthis reason the arrangements described above incorporate a numberof safeguards to protect the manning of the Services; but theybreak new ground by enabling the Serviceman to complete hisengagement at the time of his precise choosing.   The &quot;noticeengagement&quot; should thus be welcome to the Serviceman as an increasein his freedom of choice; welcome to public opinion as a majorrelaxation of the rigidity of the Service engagement structure;&quot;and good for the Services themselves as an incentive to recruit-ment and re-engagementRECRUITMENT AND RE-ENGAGEMENT DURING 1971-72Male Officers16.   The main developments during the nine months ending31 December 1971 have been as follows.    (Fuller details aregiven in Annex A, Table 3).(a)   For the Navy, a significant improvement in recruitment for full career commissions in general and to theEngineering branch (including both full career and short service commissions) in particular.   The number of graduates and undergraduates joining the Seaman and engineering branches continues to increase, thoughrecruitment to both branches remained somewhat below- W* -CONFIDENTIAL
the required levelo    In addition 122 Royal NavalScholarships and Reserved Cadetships were awarded tohoys still at school for entry in two years&apos; time.For the Royal Marines, the continued shortage of fullcareer entrants was largely offset by an increasedintake of short service officers, many of whom aresubsequently proving suitable for transfer to fullcareer commissions.   The numbers recruited from civilianlife were as follows:-Table royal Navy and Royal Marines	1 April to 31 December (9 months)		Percentage difference 1 971 over 1970 C+ or -)	1970	1971	Officer Cadets University Cadets Direct Graduate Entry Scheme Other schemes Total						(b)     For the Army, a substantial increase in the number of applicants for commissions (including young menenlisting as soldiers with a view to subsequent commis-sioning) was largely offset by an increase in the failure-rate at the Regular Commissions Board.   The Sandhurstentry of 237 fell short of the requirement of 1+50.   the entry to Mons Officer Cadet School is somewhat below the
corresponding intake of last year, but over the whole year is likely to be near the target of 250.   The most encouraging improvement is in the university entry,which for the Sandhurst Arms has more than doubled.The figures for voluntary retirement continue todecrease.   The numbers embarking on cadet training orcommissioned direct from civilian life were as follows:-Table 2Army	1 April to 31 December (9 months)		Percentage difference 1971 over 1970 C+ or -)	1970	1971	Officer Cadets -Sandhurst Mons	2U5 195	237 (166)	University Cadets Direct Graduate Entry Scheme Other schemers	55 17 51	( 86) ( 37 ( 37)	Total	563	(563)	(c)     For the Royal Air Force, recruitment of graduate directentrants and cadets showed an improvement over 1970 andthe number of graduate entrants more than doubled.Aircrew recruiting was good.   There was an overallsurplus of candidates for the Ground branches, inparticular the Engineer branch, and save for theMedical and Education branches targets were virtuallymet.   The numbers recruited from civilian life were asfollows:-&apos;
Table 3Royal Air Force	1 April to 31 December (9 months)		Percentage difference 1971 over 1970 C+ or -)	1970	1971	Officer Cadets University Cadets Direct Graduate Entry Scheme Other schemes Total						(d)     Shortages of doctors persist in all three Services.Recruitment to the Royal Army Medical Corps has howeverimproved considerably during 1971-72, as has thenumber of conversions from .short service to permanent commisions in the Corps.17.   The Army&apos;s Short Service Limited Commission scheme, which enables young men to serve some months in the Army before going on to university, has proved very successful.   Although it is designed primarily to publicise the role of the Army, about halfof those commissioned under the scheme have decided to takeuniversity cadetships.   The Royal Air Force have recently introduced a somewhat similar scheme whereby a limited number of young men mayspend a short time with the Royal Air Force between leaving schooland going on to university.   The scheme has already proved veryattractive; a large number of applications were received for the30 available places.
.    Male other ranks18.   The services recruiting achievement during the nine month sending 31 December 1971 is set out in Table k below.   A fullerpicture and certain definitions are shown at Annex A, Table  &quot;      J7.The salient features are as follows:(a) For the Navy and Army the upswing which began in 19^and continued in 1970 gained further momentum.   Thelevel of junior enlistments in the Army was so highthat special measures had to be taken to enable thetraining organisation to handle them.   There were somepockets of shortage, however, particularly in theEngineering Mechanic, Communications and Electricalbranches of the Navy.(b) The Royal Air Force too have had an excellent yearand, save for minor deficiences in one or two trades,are likely to meet 1971-72 recruiting targets in full.Reduced targets for the year, resulting from a series of manpower economy measures, combined with a high numberof applications for enlistment, have enabled morerigorous standards of selection to be applied.- h8 -

In the Armyan improvement at the nine year point is offset by minor reduc-tions at the six and 12-year points.   The prolongation rate for- kS -CONFIDENTIAL
early recruits to the Army&apos;s three year engagement, which wasmade generally available in April 1969, is likely to reach &quot; per cent, mostly to nine years; for more recentrecruits, however, the rate will probably be slightly lower.In the Royal Air Force the rate of prolongation to non-pensionableengagements has continued to improve; restrictions still apply topensionable engagements.20.   The Royal Navy has made further progress with its policy ofliberalising the rules for premature voluntary release.   Duringthe year the minimum qualifying period for release has beenreduced from 5? to /&quot;fivej years of a nine year engagement inthe Royal Navy.21.   The Army1s centralised selection system is now in operation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.   It provides all recruitswith a detailed briefing on the roles of the arms and servicesand the trades the Army has to offer.Women&apos;s Services22.   In general, recruitment to the Women1s Services has been satisfactory during the year, though there are still shortages in certain officer categories, notably in the Naval and Armynursing Services and the General Duties (Ground) branch of theWomen&apos;s Royal Air Force.PROMOTION POLICY &apos;23.   The first selections for the new rate of Fleet Chief PettyOfficer, equivalent to Warrant Officer in the other Services,were made early last year, emphasis being placed on ability ratherthan seniority.   This approach to selection has now been applied
at preceding level, covering promotion from Petty Officer toChief Petty Officer, the old roster system being replaced by oneinvolving selection boards and giving increased emphasis to merit.The first selection boards sat in the autumn of last year.FAMILY WELFARE2h.    Service in the Armed Forces sometimes involves periods of separation of a man from his dependents.   This problem is especiallyacute in the Royal Navy whose welfare organisation exists to supplement the services provided by local authorities and such bodies as the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Families Associa-tion. (SSAFA).   To ensure that the organisation continues to meetthe special needs of naval families, a committee has been set up under the chairmanship of Sir Frederic Seebohm to review the Navy&apos;swelfare requirements in the light of the best modern thinking and practice.   The committee, which has started its work, has beengiven terms of reference which permit a wide-ranging study of allfacets of the separation problem.   The Committee expects to make its report early in 1973.DISCIPLINE25.   It is planned to bring the Armed Forces Act 1971 into force on 1 July 1972.   The Act brings the disciplinary provisions ofthe three services more closely into line and places them on thesame statutory basis. /THE DEFENCE MEDICAL SERVICES26.   As a result of a review by Ministers In 1970 of recruitment and other problems facing the Defence medical, dental and nursing services, it was decided to set up a committee of inquiry to- 51 -
examine the arrangements for providing medical, dental and nursing services for the Armed Forces in the light of develop-ments in defence policy, and to make recommendations.   Thechairman of the committee is /&quot;Sir Edmund ComptonJ7, and themembers include representatives of the medical profession, publichealth administration and the Armed Forces.27.    A standing advisory committee has also been set up to advise the Secretary of State on the postgraduate education of medical and dental officers of the Armed Forces.   The chairman of thiscommittee is Mr Harold Edwards, the members include representa-tives of the Royal Colleges and the Directors General of theDefence Medical Services.- 52 -
CONFIDENTIALVSUPPORT.HIGHER DEFENCE TRAINING AND STUDIES1.     The Royal College of Defence Studies (formerly the ImperialDefence College) has completed its first course.   Students fromabroad came from 16 countries including seven European countries.The National Defence College (formerly the Joint Services StaffCollege) opened in August 1971*2.    The close association between the Ministry of Defence and the universities and other academic institutions has been extended.There are now seven Defence Lecturer posts, with costs borne on defence Votes, at Aberdeen University,   All Souls College, Oxford,Edinburgh University (two), King*s College, London (two) and southampton University.   Seven serving officers hold DefenceFellowships for the current academic year at the University ofLondon (King&apos;s College), (three), Edinburgh, Oxford (PhysicalChemistry Laboratory), Cambridge (Clare Hall) and the City UniversityStudy conferences sponsored by the Ministry of Defence were heldin April 1971 at St Antony&apos;s   College, Oxford on managementproblems;   in September 1971j organised jointly by SouthamptonUniversity and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich on the roles ofmaritime forces in the security of Western Europe;    and in November1971, at Southampton University on the operation of trans-national industrial consortia.    Service officers and Ministry of Defenceofficials have taken part in a range of other seminars and discussions with the academic world.- 53 -
INITIAL AND SPECIALIST training royal NAVY AND ROYAL MARINESTraining for RN General List Officers3.     Changes introduced in the professional and academic trainingof young General List officers in all specialisations take accountof the special requirements of young men entering the Royal Navyunder the University Cadet Entry scheme and the need for all GeneralList officers to he appointed to a sea job as soon as possible.From May 1972 onwards -(a) the traditional Naval College entrant to allspecialisations will complete his General NavalTraining at Dartmouth in under two terms insteadof a full year;(b) the Seaman and Supply and Secretariat Naval Collegeentrant will proceed straight from his General NavalTraining to a slightly reduced period of academicstudies at Dartmouth, unless he i3 willing and ableto go to University, and will then do his Fleettraining;(c) the young Engineer entrant will normally go to theRoyal Naval Engineering College Manadon to get hisdegree after one year In the Service instead of two and will complete his Fleet training when he hasgraduated;   some will go to Manadon after only ashort Acquaintance Course at Dartmouth;
(d)   the final stage of the training for Seaman officers(Operations and Warfare Courses lasting about 32 weeks)will be reduced by about a third and will be adequatepreparation for the duties of the first sea job, duringwhich the young officer   must obtain his Bridge Watch-keeping and Ocean Navigation certificates,h.     A deferred University Cadet Entry will be introduced whichwill allow a young man to do some of his professional training before going up to university.   This should appeal, for instance,to those who would like a year&apos;s break betv/een leaving school andstarting their degree course and to those who stay on at school after two years in the sixth form to take university entrance examinationsand may then not wish to stay on at school for a full third year.Introduction of Principal Warfare Officer5.     Seaman officers reaching middle seniority as lieutenantsafter about 7-8 years in the Service need further professionalotraining.   In. the past, this has been given in the form of longsub-specialist courses in, for example, Navigation, Communications,Gunnery, Torpedo and Anti-Submarine.   Sub-specialisation at that stage in an officer&apos;s career, however, no longer meets the needsarising from the speed and complexity of modem warfare which require an &quot;across the board&quot; knowledge rather than deep knowledge in onesub-specialisation.   This need has led to the concept of thePrincipal Warfare Officer (PWO) trained so that he can both &quot;fightthe ship&quot; and give his captain co-ordinated advice on operational- 55 -
matters covering all sub-specialisations.   The concept was givenextensive sea trials and is now being adopted throughout the fleet and a PWO Course will be introduced in 1972,   The major part of thecourse will be devoted to common warfare training.   Some officers will need greater expertise at a later stage in their careers onCommand staffs and In big ships and will receive further trainingnormally after one dob at sea as a PWO.Apprentice Training6.    It has been decided to combine the training of/ Artificer andMechanician Apprentices of the same category.   From 1 January 1972the Mechanician Apprentice entry will be phased, out and the upperage limit for the Artificer Apprentice entry raised to 21 years tocater for those currently recruited a.s Mechanician Apprentices.ARMYJungle Warfare Training7.    The British Jungle Warfare School in Malaysia closed at theend of 1971o   A new Malaysian Army Training Centre will open at thesame location in April 1972 and arrangements have been made with theMalaysian Government for British jungle warfare training to continuethere.ROYAL AIR FORCE    &apos;Cranwell8.    As a consequence of recent decisions relating to aircrewtraining, the development of the graduate entry scheme and new proposals for general service training, a comprehensive review of
the part to he played by Cranwell in the training of officers isbeing undertaken.   It is now envisaged that the RAF officer cadettraining unit will not be moved to Cranwell at the end of 1973 (ashad previously been proposed) but will remain at Henlow, and thatCranwell will become primarily a graduate and post-graduate training centre.   To achieve this Cranwell will undertake the general serviceand basic flying training of graduate entrants and the professionaltraining of all engineer, supply and secretarial officers.   Cranwellwill also accommodate the College of Air Warfare which will be movedthere from Mariby.FLYING training royal NAVY9.     Royal Navy rotary wing flying training has expanded duringthe past year.   During 1972 the Commando Flying Training task willbe transferred from RNAS Culdrose to RNAS Yeovilton:   the RN ObserveiSchool at Lossiemouth will then move to Culdrose.ROYAL AIR FORCE10.   The first course of university graduates under the GraduateEntry Scheme completed their basic flying training at Cranwell inAugust 1971.   Operational conversion of aircrew to the Harrier,Phantom and Nimrod aircraft has continued throughout the year andcommenced on the Puma helicopter in March 1971.   In May 1971 theRoyal Air Force took over responsibility from the Royal Navy fortraining Royal Air Force aircrew on the Buccaneer aircraft and will assume the operational conversion training of Royal Navy aircrew on- 57 -
the Buccaneer and Phantom aircraft in April and September 1972respectively.11.   Following the decision to replace the Gnat and the Hunter witha new Jet trainer less sophisticated and expensive than the Jaguar,it has been decided to develop the HS 1182 as an advanced jet trainerfor the Royal Air Force.   The Bulldog is to be ordered for theUniversity Air Squadrons and for certain other duties.COMMONWEALTH AND FOREIGN TRAINING12.   In 1971 more than 4,000 officers and men from over 60 different countries attended a wide variety of courses within the UnitedKingdom.   The Services also continued to provide personnel on loanand in training teams to other nations to assist with local training.13.   The Canadian Government has agreed to a 10 year plan underwhich UK forces will make increased use of Canadian military training facilities.   In addition to existing arrangements, from November 1972one Royal Marines Commando with its attendant helicopter squadronwill train at Gagetown, New Brunswick, for up to five weeks every year.   The Army will have use of a major new training area atSuffield, Alberta.   Training:of Battle Groups from BAOR will beginthere in 1972.   The area offers excellent facilities for highlyrealistic training of armoured units, and will contribute greatly to the efficiency of the units of all arms which use it.   Theagreement also provides for the continued use of Goose Bay as a base for low level navigation training by Vulcans.ADVENTUROUS TRAINING14.   An expanded tri-Service programme of adventurous training in- 58 -
the United Kingdom and BAOR will start in 1972-73 and he fully-effective in 1973-7U.   The programme will include mountain trainingski-ing, gliding, free-fall parachuting, sub-aque   diving andoffshore sailing.PRODUCTION REPAIR AND SUPPLY ORGANISATION INTHE UNITED KINGDOMHM DOCKYARDS &amp; THE ROYAL NAVAL SUPPLY ORGANISATIONProgramme of Work15.   The( Royal Dockyards will again have a full programme of work during the financial year 1972-73*   Portsmouth will undertake thenormal scheduled refit of the cruiser HMS Blake, one refit andtwo long refits of guided-missile destroyers and the refit of sixfrigates.   A three stream refitting programme for conventionalsubmarines will also be undertaken.   The programme at Devonport,in addition to the conversion of HMS Hermes to a commando carrierand of a number of Leander Class frigates to take the Ikara anti-Dsubmarine weapon, includes the first dry docking at this .yard of a nuclear submarine (HMS Valiant) and the refit of three conventionalsubmarines.   Chatham and Rosyth will undertake long and normalrefits of frigates in addition to their major task of refittingand refuelling nuclear submarines.; - /V- 59 -
Productivity16.   Productivity agreements have been signed with the unions and are in operation at all four of the Home Dockyards, theNaval Base at Portland and many Royal Naval Supply Establishments.Relocation of Naval Stores Depots17.   Planning of the move of the Royal Naval Stores Depot (RNSD)at Coventry to Llangennech is going ahead.   It was also announcedlast month that it has been decided to rationalise the tasks of.the RNSDs at Copenacre near Bath and Eaglescliffe on Teesideby concentrating them at RAF Hartlebury in Worcestershire.The Depots at Copenacre and Eaglescliffe would otherwise requireheavy expenditure over the next few years for maintenance and improvement.   RAF Hartlebury is a purpose-built StoreDepot that will be surplus to the RAF&apos;s requirements by the endof 197U, and there will be substantial savings for the defence budget, both in capital and running costs, by taking over thisoaccommodation for the RNSDs.   The precise programme for thetransfer remains to be worked out and the staffing implicationsdiscussed with the Staff and Trade Union Sides./- 60 -CONFIDENTIAL
Computer Developments in the Naval Supply Organisation18.   During 1972 a large computer will be installed at Bath tocontrol a complex of other smaller new computers and accountingmachines in home dockyards and armament depots.   This unifiedautomatic data processing system with its associated datatransmission links will provide more effective stock control ofstore transactions throughout the United Kingdom.   Later thesystem will be expanded to undertake pay-roll, cost accountingand production control.ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESMallabar Committee Interim Report19.       Following the recommendations of the Mallabar committee it has been decided that the ROF organisation should be given moreindependence and authority within the Ministry of Defence; thatit should have a broader hierarchy covering all aspects of management; and that its finances should be placed on a morecommercial basis.   A restructured ROF Board is being formed whichwill resemble more closely the policy-making Board of a commercialcompany.   A Trading Fund will be introduced to replace the presentAnnual Vote arrangements, subject to enactment of the necessary legislation: meanwhile certain transitional financial arrangements will be introduced as part of the process of relating the ROForganisation more closely to normal commercial standards.Output20.   The output from ROF in 1972-73 is expected to be  67mexcluding the value (about  23m) of components supplied to the- 61 -CONFIDENTIAL
factories for incorporation in their products.   Whilst theMinistry of Defence is the major customer for ROF manufacturesome 30 per cent of production in 1972-73 will be for export.Ammunition Procurement21.   Following recommendations made by consultants on theproduction of ammunition the ROFs are now assuming responsibilityfor procurement of ammunition packages and components, hithertopurchased centrally by the Ministry and issued free to factoriesas embodiment loan items.    On completion of this transfer of authority the ROFs will supply ammunition on a &apos;complete round&apos;basis.-Planning and Control .22.   The transfer of responsibilities and staff to the ROForganisation which was recommended by the Raby Committee has beencompleted at five engineering factories and should be completed in the remaining two by the end of 1972.ROYAIqAIR FORCE ADMINISTRATION AND SUPPLY ORGANISATIONFuture of Stornoway Airfield23.    The Civil Aviation Authority is due to take over from theDepartment of Trade and Industry on 1 April 1972 the responsibilityfor providing civil aerodrome facilities at a number of aerodromes in Scotland, including Stornoway.   Because of the important defence interests involved there this airfield is being transferred fromthe Department of Trade and Industry to the Ministry of Defence.An area required for civil operations will be leased back to theCivil Aviation Authority, which will operate this airfield as a civil airport.- 62 -
Supply Support for Anglo-French Aircraft2h.    A bl-national support arrangement for Anglo-French Jaguaraircraft has heen made with the French Government.   Each country will procure and hold a joint stock of items of equipment of itsown manufacture to meet the combined requirements of both countries,,thus avoiding duplication of large stock-holdings.   Detailedprocedures are now being implemented.25.    Suitable arrangements have also been made for supply supportof Anglo-French helicopters; these are being further developed.26.    studies on repair work on aero-engines and on certain aircraftcomponents, which is not currently undertaken within MaintenanceCommand, are in hand.   The aim is to establish the feasibilityand cost-effectiveness of Maintenance Command undertaking repairfunctions in these fields to increase operational flexibility.SUPPLY CO-ORDINATIONSupply Systems27.    Requirements for the development of the Services&apos; supplysystems in the next 10 years have been assessed.   The aims are to achieve the maximum degree of standardisation of the ADP systems of the three Services and to! incorporate some of the relatedaspects of Defence administration in areas such as procurement,contracting and accounting.WORKS SERVICES28.   A substantial proportion of the Defence Budget is expendedon works services provided by the Department of the Environment.For example the construction programme for the redevelopment ofthe Naval Bases at Devonport, Rosyth and Portsmouth is now- 63 -
gathering momentum and an expenditure of some  75m over 10 years is planned.   A primary aim is to provide modern industrialworking conditions along with functional and economic buildings and facilities.   Requirements generally in Northern Irelandaccount for a substantial part of the Army&apos;s expenditure on works services and additionally a start has been made on the provisionof permanent accommodation for the Ulster Defence Regiment.   Workon a new Military Hospital at Woolwich to replace that at Millbankwill begin during the year in addition to a major hospitalrebuilding project at Gatterick.   For the Royal Air Force a startwill be made in the course of the year on two major items, theprovision of modern storage accommodation at an estimated costof some  5m and a programme costing about  5m of works requiredto cater for the introduction of the Jaguar aircraft.   All three services continue to give priority to the improvement of living accommodation for single servicemen and the provision of quarters for the increasing proportion of married personnel.   The Depart-ment of the Environment will build about 2,000 new married quarters this year as well as improving, where appropriate^existing houses and estates.LANDS29.   The committee under the chairmanship of Lord Nugent ofGulldford,&apos; which has been reviewing defence land holdings inthe United Kingdom has completed a first survey of all the siteswithin its terms of reference and is now engaged in a detailed examination of individual sites, including consideration of representations received from the general public and interested bodies.- 6k -
30.    The committee&apos;s preliminary review has found that over16 miles of coastline are surplus and appropriate disposalaction is being taken.HIRINGS31.   The cost of hiring married accommodation for all theServices in 1972-73 amounts to about /&quot; 3.77m j in the UnitedKingdom and /&quot;&quot; 1h. 6m-7 overseas.   Of the overseas expenditureabout /&quot; 9.75m^7 is for hiring married accommodation in Germanywhere the number of hirings is expected to reach 19,500 by theend of 1972-73 compared with 13,500 at the start of 1971-72.MOVEMENTSPersonnel and Families32.   The repatriation of Service families from the Far East andthe Gulf, totalling /&quot;*39,000^7 passengers, was carried out almostentirely by aircraft of Air Support Command.   About h3,000personnel have been moved to and from Northern Ireland during theyear by sea and air, with maximum use of Service resources.Freight33.   Overseas.   The use of containers is steadily expanding, andis now the normal means of resupply to Germany, Cyprus, malta and Hong Kong with consequent savings in costs.3h.   The United Kingdom.   Following the success of pilot schemes in selected areas, changes, designed to permit greater flexibility in the use of nationalised transport agencies, will be generallyintroduced in 1972 into the Services&apos; freight movement system inthe United Kingdom.METEOROLOGY35.   There has been no falling off in the demand from industry,- 65 - &apos; &apos;CONFIDENTIAL
- 66 -commerce and the general public for services provided by theMeteorlogical Office: in 1971 direct enquiries to weather centres and other forecasting offices again exceeded one and a half million.   The IBM 360/195 computer has been installed at Bracknelland is now being used for operational trials and research work.36.    The Meteorological Office continues to play its part in theactivities of the World Meteorological Organisation.    The SixthWorld Meteorological Congress held in Geneva in April 1971confirmed the plan for the World Weather Watch as the core ofthe international meteorological system and decided to continuethe Voluntary Assistance Programme to support its implementation;The Congress also supported the proposal for an intensiveinternational study of atmospheric motions in the Tropical Atlanticunder the Global Atmospheric Research Programme.SALES37.    In October 1971, as a result of the merger of the Ministryof Aviation Supply with the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Salesorganisation was reconstituted.    In place of separate salesdirectorates dealing with naval and army equipment on the onehand and aerospace equipment on the other, the new directoratesdeal with all types of defence equipment on a geographical basis.The marketing side of the organisation has been strengthened toensure that the fullest account is taken of export prospectswhen the equipment requirements of our own Services are beingformulated.   These changes enable&apos;the Department to give a betterservice both to overseas customers and to British exporters andare expected to contribute to further increases in exports of
- 67 -defence equipment, which in 1972-73 are expected to amount toabout  &quot;&amp;      mj,COST AND MANPOWER38.   The cost and Service and Civilian manpower engaged in supportfunctions is shown at Annex  &quot;j,
VIRESEARCH AND development cost OF RESEARCH AND development .    During 1972-73 the total cost of research and development isexpected to &quot;be /&amp;      m?*   A functional breakdown of this expenditure is shown at Annex  &quot; J.RESEARCH2.     The Defence Research Programme, which is carried out inGovernment establishments, industry and the universities, provides the base for development projects, both national and collaborative.Following the setting up of the Procurement executive in the Ministry of Defence, changes have been made in the responsi-bilities for the formulation and management of that programme.   TheDefence Research Committee will give guidance to the ControllerResearch and Development Establishments and Research on broad policy issues concerning scientific research and the resources involved.The Controller will have the responsibility for managing the research programme both within the Department and extra-murally.DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES 1972-73COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS3.    Collaboration between Britain and her allies, particularlyin Europe, continues to grow in importance.   The Multi-Role combat aircraft remains the most important single project in the programmeboth on military grounds and from a financial and industrial pointof view.   Development is going well.   The three partners, Britain,- 68 -
Italy   and the Federal Republic of Germany, completed a thoroughreview of the programme last summer.   Other aircraft projects arebeing undertaken in collaboration with France including the Jaguarcombat aircraft and three helicopters, the Lynx. Gazelle and Puma.The Puma has now entered service with the Royal Air Force;   the others are at various stages of development.   The Anglo-French Martelair-to-surface gulded-weapon is due to enter service in 1973*ho    Germany and Italy are also collaborating with Britain in thejoint development and production of two major artillery systems $a 155 mm towed medium gun (already well into development) and a self-propelled 155 mm howitzer (just entering full development).   In1970 Belgium became a partner in the programme for the development and production of a family of air-portable tracked aluminium armouredcombat reconnaissance vehicles.   The first of these, Scorpion, isnow going into production and will start to enter into service withthe Army in the next few months.5, Work will continue on a number of other projects; the mostimportant of these in each of the main development areas are setout below:OTHER PROJECTSAircraft(a)   thethe conversion of the Victor Mark 2 to the tankerrole;the development of the HS 1182 as a new advancedjet trainer for the Royal Air Force.- 69 -
