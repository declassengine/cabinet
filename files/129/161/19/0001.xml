HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 1914 February 1972CABINETFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF magistrates  COURTSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor. At their meeting on 4th February, the Home and Social AffairsCommittee considered my memorandum proposing that the administrationof the magistrates  courts should become a central governmentresponsibility within the framework of the existing court service; and amemorandum by the Home Secretary disagreeing with this proposal. ,The Committee were unable to reconcile the different opinions expressed at the meeting and they invited the Home Secretary and myself to put our views to the Cabinet.    This memorandum sets out my reasons forproposing central government control.    It is common ground betweenthe Home Secretary and myself that, if this solution were adopted, the magistrates&apos; courts ought to be administered as part of the new courtservice for which the Lord Chancellor is responsible.2. All bodies interested in the magistrates&apos; courts were asked, ina memorandum circulated by the Home Secretary in June 1971, for theirviews on the future administration of those courts having regard to the changes affecting the higher courts made by the Courts Act 1971, and the government&apos;s proposals for changes in local government.    The majorityof those consulted, and almost all those directly concerned, were infavour of the transfer of responsibility to central government as part ofthe new court service which has now been set up to administer the highercourts.    Those who took this view included the magistrates  Association,the Justices1 clerks Society, the London Magistrates&apos; Clerks&apos;Association, the National Association of Justices&apos; Clerks&apos; Assistants, theAssociation of Chief Police Officers, the Bar Council, the Law society and the Greater London Council.    Those who favoured a continuance ofthe present arrangements included the local authority associations, theCentral Council of magistrates  Courts&apos; Committees and the central council of Probation and After-Care Committees.3. The main arguments for bringing the administration of the magistrates&apos; courts under central government are that:-a.    Responsibility for magistrates and their courts is unsatis*factorily divided between the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor,Magistrates&apos; Courts&apos; Committees and the local authorities; it isnot a matter of central versus local government, but of goodadministration versus a muddle.COPY NO        p 0iconfidential
b. The Government has now assumed responsibility for all thehigher courts in England and Wales and it would be a naturalextension to do the same for the lower courts.    There are many links between the magistrates  courts and the higher courts and these will become stronger in future.c. Central control would enable court staffs to be deployed more effectively and, by providing a better career structure, would encourage recruitment.    It would also enable better training facilities to be provided.d. The Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions(Cmnd. 4153) thought that the Government should become responsible for providing accommodation for the magistrates1courts, which in many places is shared with the higher courts.Central control would ensure that resources are used more economically than at present.e. Central control would lead to greater efficiency in other directions.    It would, for instance, facilitate the recovery ofunpaid fines, which now amount to about  7 million.4. Central control would not affect local involvement in theadministration of justice.    I do not believe that the public attaches much importance to the fact that the local authorities have certainresponsibilities for the magistrates  courts.    What is seen to be important is that the magistrates themselves should be drawn from the locality in which they sit and this would continue to be so even ifcentral government became responsible for the administration of thecourts.    There is no reason why the magistrates should not continueto exercise local initiative, in a consultative capacity, through the magistrates&apos; courts&apos; committees in many matters for which they are atpresent responsible.    There has not been much support for the localauthority organisations in their wish to retain the existing system;such pressure as there has been so far in both Houses of parliament has all been in favour of centralisation.5.        It is sometimes feared that, if the Lord Chancellor were tobecome responsible for the magistrates&apos;/courts, the administration ofthe probation and after-care service would be affected.    I do notbelieve this to be the case.    The probation service is administered bycommittees of justices and others on a territorial basis, and this system could continue, subject only to an adjustment of the areas concerned inthe light of local government re-organisation. .   This may not be thetime to decide the future of the probation service, but that is no reasonto deflect us from the right decision about the magistrates&apos; courts, forwhich I believe the time is ripe.2CONfMDENTJAL
6. If the Government were now to assume responsibility, this would admittedly involve the transfer from local to central Government serviceof the justices&apos; clerks and all other members of the court service.    I doubt, however, whether this would be regarded by public opinion as an objection and I believe that the change in status of the staff involved wouldbe seen as more apparent than real.    Details of the probable costs areannexed.7. We now have a unified service to administer all the higher courts.I think that it is in principle right - and I believe that, if not now, then atsome future date it is inevitable - that this should include the magistrates&apos;courts as well.    It is significant that this is the view of the majority ofthose who are most closely concerned with these courts.    If it is right,it would plainly be sensible to make the change so as to coincide with there organisation of local government which is due to take effect in April1974.    This will in any event involve some changes in the arrangementsfor the administration of the magistrates&apos; courts (the relevant clause inthe Local Government Bill is likely to come up in Committee very earlyin March) and it would be wasteful to have to deal with the matter in two stages.    Moreover, if the principle of centralisation is rejected therewould still be some changes which I think would have to be made by legislation in respect of such matters as the jurisdiction of the magistrates&apos;courts, commissions of the peace and the training of magistrates and their staffs.8. I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree that the administrationof the magistrates&apos; courts should become a central Government respon-sibility within the framework of the existing court service and that thenecessary legislation should be introduced early next Session so as toenable the change to take effect on 1 April 1974.H of St MHouse of LordsV14 February 19723
ANNEXFUTURE ADMINISTRATION Off THE MAGISTRATES&apos; COURTSCostsApart from income from fines and fees, the costs of magistrates&apos; courts are already met from central and local taxrevenue, so that transferring costs wholly to central funds would involve no extra call on national resources.    The HomeSecretary has put the current gross running cost at about  15mp.a.;Of which all except about  6.3m is already borne by central funds.    These figures would rise to about  24m, with  9mto be transferred to central funds by 1974/75 when the transfertook place.    Capital expenditure on buildings is now  5m a year,which is to rise to about  10m a year in 1974/75.    There should,howeverjbe scope for some economies in this field; for examplewith central control a single new building could more readilyaccommodate both magistrates  courts and higher courts.    Thereshould also be long-term economies from standardising thepresent diversity of court etc furniture, office equipment, andother supplies.The acquisition of existing magistrates&apos;courts would, onthe Courts Act pattern, involve central funds in no more thanthe costs of the local authorities&apos; relevant loan charges2their 1970/71 total of  1.7m   will rise to  4m p.a. by 1974/75.staff the Home Secretary has put present staff numbers at 4,500in Justices&apos; Clerks&apos; offices, plus perhaps 200 ancillary localauthority staff in support; probably all these would be taken
- 2 -over.   Any extra staff needed to run a central training programme, might well he at least offset by the resultinggains in efficiency.    Centralising the staff managementpresently fragmented over 149 Courts Committees into the sixCircuit Headquarters must make savings possible.conclusion on the basis of discussions at official level, the treasury have accepted that -(a) without any extra call on real resources,costs transferred to central funds would on present figures be about  6.3m p.a. current,rising to about  9m by 1974/75.    Capital costs of buildings, now about  5m rising to about  10min 1974/75?would be borne directly instead of byway of loan charge;(b) some additional public expenditure cannot be excluded in due course, because some magistrates&apos;courts may need re-housing, where present(e.g.    shared) buildings are unsuitable foracquisition.    The full financial effects of theproposed changes cannot yet be worked out indetail, but are.almost certainly of relativelyminor importance.
