THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?2) 27 January, 1972METRICATION:  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry. The attached revised draft of the White Paper has been agreed with members of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.    it takes account of views expressed at the Committee&apos;s meeting on24 November and in subsequent correspondence, and of recent develop-ments in the European Economic Community (e.c.).    The Minister ofAgriculture, however, has reservations about comparative pricing(paragraphs 68 and 69).    Material inserted or substantially amendedsince November is side-lined.WHY IT IS NEEDED SOON2. I consider that a White Paper is necessary and should be published as soon as practicable, for the following reasons:-a. The present delay is increasing the costs to the nationbecause it has forced metrication off its &quot;least cost&quot; course:further delay will have cumulative effects.    There is mountingindignation and dismay in the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and in many of the more progressive and export-consciousindustries.    Evidence of this is now appearing in the NatioealPress.b. We must not go back on our promises made in the House inNovember 1970 to publish a White Paper setting out our policy on metrication.    Since then assurances in the House and elsewherehave frequently been given that this would be done &quot;as soon aspossible&quot;.    For example, a promise was given to the Party&apos;sTrade and Industry Committee in November 1971 that it would bepublished soon.c. Many letters from Members of Parliament and others havebeen answered by a reference to the White Paper.copy NO62CABINET
d. There is increasing public knowledge of, and interest in,the e.c. units of measurement directive, including a specificParliamentary Question from Arthur Lewis for oral answer on17 January.    We will have to explain our policy on it.    We can do this best through the White Paper.e. We are unable to make overdue Statutory Instrumentsbecause of the promise, given in November 1970, to await the White Paper.f. Further delay, by strengthening the impression that wewere &quot;metricating by stealth&quot; and had somethirg to hide,would play into the hands of the anti-Marketeers in the House.e.c. AND THE DIRECTIVE ON UNITS OF MEASUREMENT3. The e.c. agreed a directive in October 1971 under which allcommunity economic and administrative decisions must be in SystemeInternational metric units by the end of 1977.    This will apply to us as members.    However a formula of agreement was reached on22 December under which all our units would remain lawful until31 December 1979;  some might be retained beyond then.    There havebeen difficulties since in putting this agreement into acceptable terms inthe Treaty and we have therefore left the section of the White Paper(paragraphs 3-4 and 30-31) in square brackets in case last minutealterations become necessary, in the light of discussions in Brussels.COMPARATIVE PRICING4. We must let into the country metric packs of butter, sugar, etc.by October 1976 (see Annex II paragraph 6).    Our manufacturers wish tohave a programme of metricating our standard size packets of thesegroceries principally in 1973 or 1974.    However, the public are concerned that food manufacturers and retailers took the opportunity of decimalisationto increase their profit margins.    When metrication comes it will be disastrous if we are not seem to be taking firm action to ensure that prices do not go up at the same time.    Given this need I know of no othersolution than the adoption of comparative pricing as described inparagraph 69 of the White Paper.5. Our intention to hold prices down should be stated in the firmestterms possible.    Indeed, I would have preferred to tighten up the wordingin this paragraph to give more reassurance to consumers.conclusion. I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the publication of the white paper, as attached, at the earliest practicable date.JDDepartment of Trade and industry January 1972 2

I       SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND METRICATION1    The adoption of the metric system of weights and measurementsis spreading rapidly throughout the world.   Nearly every countryeither has already changed or is about to change to it.   Thecontinent of Europe uses it exclusively;   all the chiefCommonwealth countries and South Africa have changed or are atthe moment moving over to it.   And in the United States of america the Government has recently recommended the change.   If we kept tothe imperial system we could soon become the only major trading country using it.2    Between them, the countries which have gone or are shortly togo metric are already taking more than 80$ of our exports.   to preserve imperial specifications for home orders while an increasing proportion of our exports must be made to metricstandards, would add to the cost of manufacture and make moredifficult our penetration of overseas markets.3    It is their recognition of the fact and extent of metricationin countries to which they must sell that has led wide areas ofBritish industry voluntarily to adopt it for the home market aswell.   The competitive advantages of doing so were appreciated inEurope many years ago.   The member countries of the european economic Community have now decided to regularise and complete the process and for this purpose have recently ratified a directive setting a target date (1 January 1978) after which only a prescribed system of metric units may be used throughoutthe Communities.4    In due course, as a member of the enlarged Communities, theterms of the directive will come to be applied here as well.But we shall naturally need a longer period in which to complete the changeover.   Arrangements negotiated with the Community will ensure that units used in our legislation are retained until31 December 1979* /Where there are special reasons they may beretained for even longer^
INDUSTRY AND METRICATION5     For the reasons already mentioned. British industryvoluntarily has gone a long way towards adopting metricspecifications for home production as well as for exports. Itwas expected that in the main the broad programme for the processwould be completed by the end of 1975.   This still seems areasonable aim and it is one which has the support of theGovernment, but it is recognised that detailed examination ofparticular industries&apos; problems may make an earlier or later date preferable.6    Progress to metrication cannot be a haphazard affair, leftto individual whim and decision.   If that were to happen it couldcause confusion throughout industry and would present untolddifficulties to the consumer.   It is in everybody&apos;s intereststherefore to ensure that it takes place in a well-ordered and properly-regulated manner.   To see to this is the job of theMetrication Board.   The Board acts under the authority ofGovernment and will continue to do so, concentrating on its dualrole of coordinating the process of changeover in particularsectors of industry and giving general publicity to it.7     In recent years special programmes have been prepared forthe bxiilding, engineering and other industries.   There is no doubtthat these industries consider that the changeover is contributingsignificantly to their greater efficiency and competitiveness.Discussions with the transport industry and its users, forexample, have shown that they would welcome a changeover tometric tariffs for overseas freights, because British goods areincreasingly being carried to countries using or changing to the metric system,8    The present system for showing speed limits and other roadsigns is unlikely to be changed for a long time to come.9     The Government acknowledge and support the progress that hasalready been made.   They will not, however, use public purchasingpower deliberately to hasten the changeover from imperial to
metric units.   In their own purchasing they will use metric and international standards only when their discussions withsuppliers show that there will he general benefit from doing so.10  Meanwhile the more industry adopts metric units, the morewill the general public become involved in the whole process.The range of products covered will grow and there will be no clear boundary betwesn metric and non-metric parts of the economy.In these circumstances to attempt to keep imperial units for theindividual shopper while industry was on metric would be bothconfusing and costly.   It would also deny us the very realsavings which stand to be gained when turning over completely tometric.THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND METRICATION11     There is nothing new about using the metric system in theUnited Kingdom;   it is not some sudden innovation or recentdiscovery.   It has been lawful here for all but a few purposes,at least since the Weights and Measures (Metric System) Act of1897.   So there can be absolutely no question of &quot;metrication bystealth&quot;;   nor is there any lack of parliamentary authority forthe way it has been becoming more generally adopted.   This hasbeen a gradual process, proceeding item by item, and that is theway it will continue.12     There will be no &quot;M-Day&quot; for metrication.   But people willbecome much more aware of it - and more familiar with it - asfoodstuffs and household goods measured in metric sizes and quantities come into our shops from our own manufacturers as wellas from the continent and from other metric countries.13     Some goods, like vegetables, that are sold loose by weightmay even now lawfully be sold by the kilogramme.   But under the weights and Measures Act 1963 many items of foodstuff may onlybe sold here in imperial measures.   Steps will have to &quot;be takento allow the wider use of the metric system.   The Government will therefore propose legislation to permit the sale of metric packs in
CONFIDENTIALaddition to the existing imperial sizes.   There will also need to be some consequential legislation since our laws include manyreferences to imperial units alone.   Exact conversions to metricequivalents may sometimes be impracticable, but in those casesthe Government have no doubt that a satisfactory solution canbe found.1h    The Government have no wish to discourage the sale ofdraught beer by the pint, but equally if anyone wants to buy it by the litre or half-litre that too should be lawful.   TheGovernment have at present no plans for changing from imperialunits for the sale of milk.THE CHANGEOVER TO METRICATION15    No matter how carefully-prepared and well-regulated, thechangeover to a new system must inevitably cause some difficulties, especially for older people who have throughout their lives known only imperial units of measurement:   the younger generation will find it less difficult.   The educationauthorities already give guidance and provide facilities toteachers and others concerned, so that those parts of thecurriculum likely to be affected are modified in step with the increasing spread of the metric system.16     /The Government recognise that the period during which somefoodstuffs are sold in imperial quantities and some in metricwill, present problems for many shoppers.   The Government intend to take action to ensure both that the marking of sizes and quantities is absolutely clear and that the housewife is given full and unambiguous information about prices so that she can judge value for money/. /1 7     The move to metrication has been taking place over manyyears, but the Government believe that the time has now come whenthey must act to ensure the orderly completion of the process.In doing so they will not hesitate to take whatever steps arenecessary to protect the consumer during the period of changeoverand to minimise any difficulties which the introduction of thenew system may cause.CONFIDENTIALParagraph 18 not allotted.
II     HISTORICAL background the earlier legislation19     It has been the policy of successive British governments for a long time to allow people to use either metric orimperial units of measurement as they wished for the greatmajority of purposes.   An Act of 1864, the Metric Weights and measures Act, legalised the use of the metric system in&quot;contracts and dealings&quot;.   The Weights and Measures (MetricSystem) Act of 1897 legalised the use of the metric system for most purposes.20    While both the imperial and metric systems of units maybe used freely for most trading purposes, there is a legal obligation to use only imperial units for some purposes and only metric units for a few purposes such as the dispensing of drugs.   Under the provisions of the Weights and Measures Act,1963 certain prepacked goods may only be made up for sale incertain prescribed imperial quantities, eg multiples of halfa pound.   There is also other legislation in certainspecialised fields, for example food purity, agriculture,safety in factories, mines and quarries, and various local acts and bye-laws which have produced legal restraints on theadoption of metric units.   The implications are discussed further below.   However, a great many of the daily transactionsinvolving units of measurement are not subject to legislativecontrol.The tradition of free choice21     Successive governments have not dictated to the scientistor engineer what units of measurement he should use.   Britishindustry has, throughout this century, been free for the mostpart to use either the metric or imperial systems subject onlyto observance of a statutory discipline in trade, notablyretail trade, and some other circumstances where statutes or regulations use units of measurement.
III     INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE OP THE METRIC system the metric system22     The metric system was introduced and accepted in Prance duringthe revolutionary decade of the 1790s as a logical andscientifically-based replacement for the varied traditional systemsthen employed in Prance.   Eighteen countries including the USAsubscribed to the Convention of the Metre in 1875 to establish and preserve international standards of length and mass.   The UnitedKingdom had an observer at the 1875 conference, acceded to theConvention in 1884, and has participated since that date in thedevelopment of the metric system and the definition of units onwhich it is based.   In 1960, the General Conference of weights and Measures, which meets under the Convention, agreed at its11th Conference to promulgate an &quot;International System of Units&quot;(frequently described as the &quot;Systeme International&quot; or &quot;SI&quot;).This is the current version of the metric system.23    The International System is not a radically new system.Its departures from the well-established pattern of previousversions, though important in scientific and technological fields,are not such as to be important - or indeed even perceptible - in domestic life or in the bulk of trading activities.   Its effect is to simplify the metric units currently used in science and engineering.24     In terms of everyday use the metre, gramme and litre andtheir multiples and sub-multiples are the most important partsof the International System.   These are long-established units which have been met with at home or on holiday abroad by most people.   The established international units used in electricity,such as the ampere, volt and watt, are metric and also form partof the System.

published by HM Stationery Office: a simpler exposition is published by the Metrication Board.The spread of the metric system outside the UK25    There has been a steadily widening acceptance of the metricsystem since its introduction by Prance.   By 1900, 35 countries,including most of the leading European states, had adopted thesystem, and some 78 countries by 1960.   Within the last decade mostCommonwealth countries which had not already done so, among themAustralia, New Zealand and Canada, and also South Africa havedecided to adopt metric units.   All either have changed or are inthe process of changing.26    Turning to the United States, the case for a change to metric2is strongly put in the report of their Metric Study Group   whichwas published last July.   The report judges that it is inevitable that they &quot;will join the rest of the world in the use of the metric system as the predominant common language of measurement&quot;and that in the circumstances it is better that the move to metricshould be &quot;by plan rather than by no plan at all&quot;.   In presenting the report to the United States Congress the Secretary for Commerceexpressed his agreement with its conclusion and recommended thatthe United States should adopt the International System deliberatelyand carefully through a coordinated national programme.   He also recommended that they should adopt a firm commitment to a targetdate of 10 years ahead.1   Going Metric:   Metric Units, An International System.

27     If the United States follows this course the remaining non-metric countries will be few, and insignificant in world trade.Impact of the Common Market28    A major objective of the Common Market is the removal of allbarriers to trade within the Community.   The Member States of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) were among the pioneer users ofthe metric system over the last century and all have ratified theInternational System as agreed by the General Conference of weights and Measures in 1960.   It was thus natural that one of the strands&quot;by which the e.c. aimed to achieve their common policy was anagreement on the units of measurement;   it was also natural thatthis agreement should be based on the International System.29     Article 100 of the e.c. Treaty empowers the Council of theEuropean Communities, on the proposal of the Commission, to issuedirectives &quot;for the approximation of such provisions imposed bylaw, regulation and administrative action as directly affect the setting up or operation of the Common Market&quot;.   The Commission hasalready prepared a series of directives aimed at eliminating the obstacles to trade within the Community which such provisionscreate.   These directives, when issued by the Council, becomebinding on the Member States.30     In October 1971 the Council ratified a directive on units ofmeasurement.   This provides for the adoption by 1 January 1978, ofa prescribed system of metric units of measurement over a wide area,including the economic field, the field of public health and safety,- -     - - - : - -  . .and administrative activities.   This is firmly based on theInternational System, though it also includes certain additions andother special arrangements, some temporary and some permanent.confidential   See Annex I
31     This directive would apply to the United Kingdom as amember of the e.c..   But we have been able, in the course of negotiations for entry to the Community, to arrange that wemay retain in use all the units given in the Weights and measures Act and other major legislation until 31 December 1979./&quot;in addition, for units which are of special importance tous it will be possible to have this date extended.^32     However, the directive apart,  there are compellingeconomic reasons which are discussed in the following chapterswhy industries exporting to all parts of the world should use metric units.   The continued production of imperial sizedgoods for the home market would not only weaken those industries&apos; competitive power but would also entail higher prices for British consumers.    It is on this basis that the voluntary changeover of industry to metric units has goneforward and the progress which has been made shows conclusivelythat this is a most forceful argument in its own right.   Tothis extent, therefore, the implementation by the UnitedKingdom of the e.c. directive gives legal form to a pattern,already firmly established, which is likely in large measure to be achieved by 1975.   The Government in any case regard it as most desirable in the interests of &quot;^our economic prosperity that the maximum practicable progress towardsthe metric system should be made within the next few years.
IV   THE IMPACT (V lNTEid\ATIOWAL Stf/ftDAHDXWfON33     Standardisation and metrication are in principle two distinctsubjects but in practice are closely related.    The recent upsurgeof international standards has been one important reason forthe acceptance of metric units by so much of industry in theUnited Kingdom.    Compliance with international standards willincreasingly be a condition of successful British participation in international trade,particularly by our engineering industries.3I4.     A great change in the number and status of internationalstandards is in progress.   About 2000 international standardshave by now been agreed.    Over 60 percent of these have been produced during the last five years and a recent forecastsuggests a further increase to perhaps 20,000 world standards in ten years&apos; time.   Many purchasers will increasingly find it more convenient to stipulate compliance with the internationalstandards particularly for engineering products.35     International standardisation offers a further benefit tothe manufacturer.    In many fields of engineering there has beena proliferation of products with only minor differences and themaintenance of this excessive variety adds to the manufacturers and the customer&apos;s costs.    The acceptance of the world code of standards is often the only practicable way of economising in the range of products, and can reduce the costs to all the partiesaffected.     International standardisation also reduces the numbers
of documents, including engineering drawings, that have to beproduced and filed, and the variety of test procedures andtechnical and safety regulations that must he observed,    domecountries, in particular nations with limited resources of technical expertise, often find it advantageous to aaoptinternational recommendations as national standards.Standards and metric units36     All but a few of these international standards are expressed in metric measures.   This is partly a consequenceof the well-established dominance of metric units in purescience and advanced technology in all countries and partly because the majority of active members of the international organisations are metric countries.    National delegations cannoteven-participate effectively unless they accept metric units.It is therefore natural that the British Standards Institutionwas among the first bodies to point to the inevitableacceptance of metrication by British industry.Standards and the promotion of exports37 It is noteworthy that the preliminary report of the UnitedStates Metric Study Group was entitled &quot;International Standards&quot;International Standards. US Metric Study Report NBS 3P 3U5-11970.
and drew the conclusion that the Uniteu States must eitherparticipate more&apos;actively in producing and using the world code,or maintain a superior technology ana offer superior products for international trade to overcome the disadvantages of non-&apos;conformity to the code.   The report stresses the difficultiesof even the United States remaining a &quot;front runner&quot; if it kept to non-metric units.38     The United Kingdom exports  v1&apos;9 percent of its gross national product compared with only 5s&apos; percent for the United States.    Thisshows how much more we depend on world trade than does theUnited States:    our concern to reduce harriers to world trade should he even stronger than theirs.   The United Kingdom cannotrely as in former times on a superior technology over a widefront but must export, today, primarily to countries at a similarlevel of industrial development and with a comparabletechnological capacity, although often in different fields.Industry in the future will have increasingly to export goodscomplying with international standards, though there willremain a place for work to a special specification, particularly for the smaller manufacturer.    Where international metricstandards are in use or in preparation the continued use ofimperial measures even in the home market will impair   Br.itishperformance in export markets.    As international standards becomestill more widely used,  so1would the United Kingdom&apos;s handicapDecome increasingly severe.
CONFIDENTIALV DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOMRecommendations of the Hodgson Committee39     The Hodgson Committee, after a two year review of theexisting Weights and Measures legislation, came to the unanimousconclusion, in their Report published in 1951:&quot;that the metric system is,  in the broadest senseand in the interests of world uniformity, a better&apos;system of weights and measures than the imperial;that a change from imperial to metric for all tradepurposes is sooner or later inevitable;  that a continuance of the present option to use either the metric or the imperial until the inevitable comesabout will cause in the long run more inconveniencethan an ordered change within a specified period;and that the long-term advantages which would flow from an organised change in the near future wouldfar outweigh the inconveniences of the change itself&quot;.hO     This Committee based these recommendations primarily uponthe needs of international trade and United Kingdom exports.    Itemphasised that, &quot;it is in the field of international trade thatthe benefits of uniformity of measurement come fully into theirown&quot; and that &quot;it is obviously illogical for there to be two separate systems in a world which is, from the trading point oiview, becoming rapidly smaller; and the advantages of a decimalsystem are such that it is highly unlikely that any country not now using it would adopt the non-decimal imperial system.&quot;    TheHodgson Committee&apos;s recommendations were based on the committee&apos;view of future trends, which have indeed proved to be well-founded.However, influential industrial opinion was divided at that timeabout the desirability of metrication.   The Committee&apos;s   recommend-at ions were widely regarded as premature.In 1950 k3% of United Kingdom exports went to those countrieswhich were then already metric.   With the. change, in our pattern of trade, these same countries now take   58$.Report of the Committee on Weights and MeasuresLegislation, 1951, Omd. 8219 HMSO.CONFIDENTIAL
A further 25$ of our exports in 1970 were to countries that since1950, either had adopted or were in the course of changing to the metric system.   Thus over 83$ of UK exports are now to marketsthat either are or soon will be metric.Industry&apos;s approach to Government42     It was primarily the steady growth of metric at the expenseof imperial markets that influenced the then Federation of BritishIndustries (now the Confederation of British Industry) to informthe Government in 1965* after two polls of its members, that themajority of members, both in number of firms and in total size ofbusiness, was in favour of the adoption of the metric system asthe primary and ultimately the only method of measurement to beused in the United Kingdom.   This advice was offered shortly after an enquiry by the British Standards Institution of its members had produced a similar consensus.   The Federation suggested that thetime was appropriate for general Government support for the change.4-3    Individual industries and the Confederation of British industry have repeatedly said that the metrication of industry should be&quot;voluntary and evolutionary&quot;.   The Government were not asked toimpose the metric system but to support and encourage a voluntarymovement that industry believed to be in the national interest.Government support for the change44    The then President of the Board of Trade said in May 1965 that:v&quot;The Government consider it desirable that British industries on a broadening front should adopt metric units, sector bysector, until that system can become in time the primary    1system of weights and measures for the country as a whole.&quot;Hansard (Commons) Vol 713, Col 32-33 (W)CONFIDENTIAL
A target date was indicated in the same statement:-&quot;The Government hope that within ten years the greater partof the country&apos;s industry will have effected the change.&quot;45     In March 1966 the Standing Joint Committee on Metricationwas appointed.   After an extensive series of consultations itreported in May 1968.   On 26 July 1968 in a statement in theHouse of Commons the then Government indicated their general acceptance of the report.   Among the principal points in thestatement were that:-a    the end of 1975 should be accepted as the generaltarget date for all provisional metrication programmes,with the qualification that if the date provedunreasonable for any particular sector the programmemight aim at an earlier or later date:b    an advisory Metrication Board should be set up to guide, stimulate and coordinate the planning for the transition of the various sectors of the economy:c     they accepted the need for legislation but did notadopt a specific date:d     there would be no question of compensation:   the costs of adopting metric weights and measures mustlie where they fell.46     The progress that has been made since 1968 suggests thatthe target date will be met and that the greater part of theindustrial sector will be using the metric system for mostpurposes by the end of 1975.   This would be well within the target date set by the e.c. directive.47 Following the General Election in 1970 the present government examined the extent to which metric units of
CONFIDENTIALmeasurement had been adopted and accepted that their use bymanufacturing industry was necessary for the well-being of the economy     The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, when hewas Minister of Technology,  gave the Governments view in av/ritten answer in the House of Commons on 20 July 1970:&quot;The Government have noted the extent of the plans and commitments already made towards the general adoptionof the metric system, described in the Pirst Report ofthe Metrication Board published in May.   The government propose to encourage these voluntary developments,including the use of metric specifications for publicpurchases as soon as consultation with suppliers showsthis to be practicable . &quot;^h8     u overnment Departments are substantial purchasers ofindustrial products and could by their purchasing policiesdeliberately hasten or delay the introduction of productsconforming to metric standards.   The Government have decidedto use     this purchasing power in step, with   the progress ofmetrication.   Government Departments are coordinating with other public authorities to promote standardisation and variety reductionin the public sector.^   To this end the Governmentwill   wherever practicable       purchase to British Standardsconforming to international recommendations.     But they do not intend to use public purchasing to force the pace of metrication.They will consult suppliers before ordering metric supplies andthey will adhere as far as possible to the programmes formetrication evolved by industry itself.k10     The Ordnance Survey has used metric measurements forsurveying for many years.

1:10,000 - approximately six inches to one mile - and largerhave been produced in metric form.   Admiralty tidetables from now on will be in metres;   and Admiralty charts are beingredrawn to show metric units, either individually as they require revision or in regional groups.   The Load Line rules for shipping are already in metric units and stabilityinformation for all new ships is required to be provided inthis form.The metric system and defence50    An important programme covers all Service equipment and stores and is in step with the programmes of industry.Since January 1970, new Service equipment has been designedin metric terms in line with industry&apos;s progress. For example,in the aviation field the drawings and documentation for all new designs of military aircraft and new equipment for the mare now expressed in metric terms.   So also are new guided weapons systems, engines and a number of military electronicsystems.   Some projects, for example the Anglo-French Jaguaraircraft, are being undertaken in collaboration with countriesalready using the metric system.51    The Ministry of Defence is also taking full advantage ofthe opportunity afforded by metrication to reduce the variety of items in Service inventories, to eliminate unnecessary variationbetween military and industrial requirements, and to conform with international engineering standards.
CONFIDENTIALIndustry&apos;s commitment to metric measure52     The programmes of industry are well advanced.   The confederation of British Industry wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry towards the end of 1970:&quot;After five years intensive preparation industry is nowirrevocably committed to metrication.   Millions of poundsworth of the new and replacement equipment purchased by industry in recent years is designed to produce to metricstandards;   thousands of man hours have gone into planning and implementing conversion programmes.   Progress is well upto schedule.   The impetus of change is growing rapidly.There can be no turning back.Metrication provides big advantages, not only to industry butto the economy as a whole.   It is simple both to teach and touse.   It offers great scope for rationalisation and varietyreduction in factory, warehouse and shop.   It offers greaterexport opportunities in an increasingly metric world.   It willgreatly ease the harmonisation of international standards,increasingly important for the removal of barriers to trade.The sooner these advantages can be realised to offset the inevitable costs of change, the better.   To delay is to getthe worst of both worlds.&quot;53     The second Annual Report of the Metrication Board describes themanner and the progress of the voluntary introduction of metricmeasurements by the various sectors of industry.   Careful planningsince 1965 has resulted in the publication of metrication programmes in many fields.   Many industries now have made substantial progressin implementing their programmes, and the production and sale ofgoods is steadily increasing.54     One of the most detailed programmes was that drawn up by theconstruction industry in 1967-   This provided for the changeover tometric being substantially completed by the end of this year.   with less than a year to go, the implementation of this programme isalready at a very advanced stage;   the value of metric projects in design for the public and private sectors totals well over  3,000million.   It has often been suggested that metrication will createparticular problems in the maintenance and renewal ofexisting buildings.   According to the trade, this is not being!,-UDENTIAL
borne out &quot;by the experience to date.    Problems will arise,  but these will not be in any material respect different from thosewhich have arisen in the past as a result or those changes inthe design and size of components which have been customary inthe industry.-55     In engineering it is now normal practice for new designs tobe in metric units.   The majority of the engineering trade associations expect that the greater part of production will bemetric by the end of 1975.56     In the textile industries the metric system will help to rationalise practices and procedures, notably the adoption ofthe internationally accepted &quot;tex&quot; system wnich is a standardisedmethod of yarn counting for all natural and synthetic fibres.    Insome parts of these industries metric working has already begunand many parts are aiming for substantial metric working bythe end of 1973.    These changes will carry through into the clothing industry.-Is partial metrication possible?57     Some people believe that industry should go metric but thatthere should be no need to involve the private consumer.    Thisview ignores the fact that more ana more of manufacturing1industry is devoted to producing consumer goods which it wouldbe uneconomic to have to malte to both imperial and metric
( 7 cortVJ Jspecifications.    Industry has consistently argued that it couldnot go far down the metric road in isolation from other sectors of the economy without foregoing many of the benefits of the metric system and incurring extra costs.    In 1970 the confederation of British Industry said:&quot;It never made much sense to talk of. industry goingmetric in isolation.   All parts of the economy areinterdependent, and whilst timing and method must he left to individual decision it is likely to be inthe interests of all that the economy should move forward roughly in step together.    It wls in 196? thatit became apparent that metrication in industry hadprogressed to the stage where business and the retailsector would soon become involved in the process.Industry&apos;s move was gradually extending beyond theprocess of manufacture to the other parts of the economy, and coordination was obviously necessary;the CBI therefore made a number of approaches tointerests concerned with distribution and the retailtrades and then suggested, and the Standing JointCommittee agreed, that the Metrication Board should beset up as national coordinator.&quot;
Agriculture and horticulture58     The progress towards a change of system which has alreadybeen made in the different sectors of agriculture was outlined in Chapter 6 of the Metrication Board&apos;s second annual report.This referred to a proposal by the Joint Metrication Group setup by farmers&apos; organisations that most of the changes shouldtake place in- 1973.    However the Metrication Board and these organisations have now accepted that this date can no longercontinue to be regarded as a feasible target.    The farmingorganisations have undertaken to hold further discussions within,the farming community about possible future plans ana subsequently to consult Government departments.    The views of the supplyingand marketing organisations concerned will also be taken intoaccount.59     tVhen we become a member of the European Communities our obligations will include the adoption of the Community systemof agricultural support.    This will involve both the industryand the Agricultural Departments in wide-ranging administrative and procedural changes, and careful coordination of the timing;of any plans for the adoption of the metric system will benecessary in this sector during this period of transition.
VT       EFFECT OF METRICATION ON THE CONSUMER60    There can never be an &quot;M-day&quot; on which the country, orretail trade as a whole, goes metric.   Going metric, quite unlikegoing decimal, can only be gradual;   first one commodity, thenanother, comes normally to be sold by metric units.   Already alarge proportion of the goods sold in chemists&apos; shops and bybuilders&apos; merchants is measured in metric terms.   The shopper isin this way slowly and gradually becoming acclimatised to the useof metric quantities.61     The impact of metric units will inevitably vary greatly fromone commodity to another.   Many foodstuffs, such as eggs and some&apos;fruit, are sold by number.   So are very many other standardhousehold purchases.   Consumer durables like motor cars, tablesand chairs and electric toasters are sold on performance andappearance and the expression of their size in metric units doesnot in the least alter either their qualities or the amount ofroom which they occupy.   Some textile products like bed-linenare already often marked in both the imperial and metric systems.62     The housewife will increasingly find goods being sold inmetric units.   Cookery books and kitchen scales are likely moreand more to come onto the market with metric, or both imperial and metric, units, but the continued use of existing equipmentshould involve only slight changes of practice.Package sizes63     There are many goods for which the Weights and Measures Act
does not prescribe standard package sizes.   Among these are such foodstuffs as sauces, soups, canned fruit and vegetablesand canned and bottled drinks, and also other goods like paintand soap, which have to have their weight or capacity, as thecase nay be, marked on them when sold prepacked.   The government intend that these markings should be in both imperial and inthe equivalent metric unit   for at least the next few years.Some of these commodities, of which paint is the best known,are now sold in a series of round metric sizes in place of theold imperial sizes.   The successor to the pint can is the500ml can which is about 12 percent smaller, and a can of1 litre has replaced that of a quart.Gk      This is one example of a world-wide trend to internationallyagreed metric sizes in tins, bottles and other packages.    In thecase of solid foodstuffs there is a tendency in many countriestowards the acceptance of a range of standard sizes,principally 125g (approximately i+^oz), 250g (approximately 9oz),500g (approximately 11b 2oz) and 1 kilogramme (approximately 2ilbs)It seems likely that these sizes may eventually established themselves throughout most of Europe and many other countries.65       Our laws require that butter, sugar, flour and some othergroceries are sold, if prepacked, in standard imperial quantities.The Government propose to permit in addition the use of a range of metric sizes such as those mentioned above.    In due course theimperial sizes may therefore fall into disuse.
66      Change in the law will he necessary to give effect tothese proposals.   A fuller statement of what is intended and why is given in Annex II.67      These changes should lead to a simpler and more straighforwardrange of sizes, which will assist the consumer.   By facilitating the export of our own products without involving specialpackaging, this should tend to reduce unit costs and therebyin the long run help to keep prices down.   Furthermore, asshoppers become accustomed to metric units, comparison of prices should be much easier./Consumer Protection68      The provisions of the Weights and Measures Act that certainfoodstuffs should be sold only in standard quantities have proved a great help in comparing value for money:    and the UK*arrangements are now being adopted elsewhere.   But when bothmetric and imperial measures are in use together it will be moredifficult to make comparisons.   Although the Government alreadyrequire the weight of each pack to be clearly marked on it theywill additionally require the new metric packs to be distinctivelymarked.    It is hoped that all manufacturers will do thisvoluntarily but if necessary the Government would use their powers under the Weights and Measures Act to ensure that thisis done.7691      /The Government are concerned to ensure that the consumerfully understands the system which is in use and is able to judge
Walue   for money during the period when both imperial and metricmeasures are in use.    One means of achieving this would be theintroduction of a system of comparative pricing in both metricand imperial quantities so that a ready means of comparison was available to the purchaser.    i&apos;or example a 500g bag of sugar mightbe required to bear not only its price of,  say, 5p but also astatement that this price was equivalent, to 10p per kilogrammeov khp Ver pound.    It will be necessary for the Government todiscuss this proposal with consumer organisations ana with industry, taking particularly into account- Diae special needs ofsmall firms.   The Government will in these discussions equallybe happy to consider any alternative method which is likely to achieve the end of ensuring that there is no risk of the consumerbeing exploited during this period^/Goods sold loose by weight70     Goods like meat, fruit and vegetables are usually weighedand wrapped in the shop before the customer&apos;s eyes, though thegrowth of supermarkets is changing shoppers&apos; habits.   The lawhas for many years permitted the retailer to weigh either ingrammes and kilogrammes or in ounces and pounds, as he and the customer see fit.   The Government expect that normal economicpressures, the change to metric in other foodstuffs, and industrialusage will promote the use of metric weights over the coming years.&quot;Beer, cider, spirits and milk71     There are no present legal restrictions on the quantity of
beer or cider which may be sold in a bottle or can, though tutsquantity must be marked.    But draught beer and cider may be sol-retail by law only in certain quantities, namely one third ofa pint, half*a-pint or multiples of half-a-pint.   The Gcvernmoi.have no wish to discourage the sale of drought beer by the pintEqually they see no reason to forbid its sale by measures of slitre or its submult iples.   To permit this would requiresubordinate legislation.    Similarly,  the sale of metric measureof gin, rum, vodka ana whisky would be permitted in licensed premises.   To avoid the risk of confusion to consumers it wouldprobaoly be undesirable to allow both imperial and metricmeasures to be used in the same bar.72     Industry is giving thought to future arrangements for the units of sale for milk but has not yet made firm plans.    Anychange would require subordinate legislation and the Governmenthas no plans for such changes at present.
73     A very large proportion of &quot;bulk freight, both domestic and international, moves on the basis of terms negotiated bycontract between the buyer or seller and the haulier.    Theterms include the units of measurement to be employed.   Makingcontracts in metric for the carriage of this traffic is,therefore, simply a matter of agreement between the parties concerned.7h     The date on which the carriers of smaller parcels switchto metric units is of importance to the many users of their services.   The carrier must for convenience have only onetariff, which may have been calculated on the basis of eithersystem of measurement, but he must accept parcels measured underboth systems, inconvenient though the recalculation will be.    lieis therefore rightly anxious to make the change at about thetime when this meets the convenience of the majority of hiscustomers.   But equally he wants to ensure that his competitorschange at the same time, and that he is keeping in step withthe wider changes which affect his operations.75     Two committees of operators and users were set up underthe auspices of the Metrication Board to draw up plans for thechange, one for inland and one for overseas transport.    TheWork of these committees is described in the second annual report of the Metrication Board.76 It is obviously desirable to use metric units for overseasfreight tariffs.   The committee of operators and users whichVII    HEIGHT TRANSPORT
studied overseas transport judged that the date of 1 January 1972should be selected for the changeover.   UK port authoritiesdecided to accept this date for the introduction of metricunits as the basis for their freight charging.   Major shippingconferences from the UK have been progressively adoptingmetric tariff structures and aim to have the process virtuallycompleted in the early months of 1972.   Discussions are continuing with authorities in USA and Canada.77    A committee concerned with overseas transport noted thatalmost all recording both for customs and statistical purposeswas in imperial units and this would have to be revised.   Theyjudgedthat, again, the date of 1 January 1972 should be selected for the changeover to metric units.   Following consultation, andwith the general agreement of the industries concerned, metricunits were introduced from this date for about one half of theTariff and Overseas Trade Classification-   Discussions are continuing on the programme for completing the change.-78    The committee dealing with inland freight tariffs metunder the aegis of the Freight Transport Association.   Itrecognised the advantages of agreeing a common date with the-overseas committee but anticipated difficulties in making thechange by 1 January 1972;   a later date for ^the change is beingcanvassed.
VIII       EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAININGEducation79    The metric system has been taught in schools, colleges and universities for many years.   The International System of Units isan indispensable part of higher and further education, and relevantcourses in science, engineering and other technical subjects arebeing modified in step with the progress of metrication in industry.80    An increasing number of pupils leaving schools from now on willbe required to use metric measures in their future occupations, andit is necessary that what they learn at school should be relevant totheir experience after leaving school.81    The increasing use of metric units outside education is reflected within the education system not only in institutions of higher and further education, but also in the schools of the UnitedKingdom.   There is no specific point at which education as a whole&quot;goes metric&quot;.   Indeed, it is not possible to forecast when the transition will have gone so far that school pupils will no longerneed to use imperial units.   A working knowledge of those imperialmeasures used in everyday life will still be needed for some years.Moreover, students in higher and further education will need toknow about imperial units if they are to make use of technical andother literature of continuing value that contains data in these units.   In general, however, schools and other educationalinstitutions are responding to* the view that their pupils and students will increasingly be expected to be familiar with metricunits and dimensions.   The rate and degree of change at any stagedepends on the subject matter and on the evaluation of local needs.
82     As part of its responsibilities, the Metrication board is charged with Keeping all educational interests informed of plans and progress in metrication, so that the educational system can respond in good time to changing neeas arising fromthe progressive adoption of metric weights and measures in industry, commerce and everyday life.    The first two annual reports of the Board have summarized the changes in progresswithin the educational system.83     The publishing industry has produced text&apos; Books and other material employing * the International System,  and a wide range of suitable books is now available at most levels.    Otherspecialist producers have made available metric equipment foruse in secondary schools, and that required for primary schoolsis now being produced.Developments in England and Wales81+     In the context of education the metric system is a curriculumquestion and its implementation is therefore a matter not forcentral government but for authorities responsible for schools and other educational institutions.    The main burden falls, ofcourse, on the teachers in the classroom and there is every reason to believe that they are fully aware of the situation.This is but one of the many changes in society which teachersincreasingly have to take into account and which are reflected in curriculum development projects involving hundreds of teachers at both the local and the national level.    More than half the local education authorities have organised their own
CONFIDENTIALin-service training programmes, and for the initial training of teachers the colleges of education aremaking adjustments to their teaching syllabuses as required.Nearly all local education authorities have made a specialallowance to help the schools and establishments of further education meet the needs created by the change to metric.They have been helped in this by the fact that the settlement for the rate support grant for 1971-72 and 19 72-73 includes provision for significant increases in real terms in expenditureper pupil in&quot;schools and in establishments of further education for items other than teaching staff salaries.85     Advice has been given to local authorities in various forms&apos;.The Department of Education and Science drew attention,  in an administrative Memorandum of August 1967, to the (1965) Governmentannouncement of the intention to change to the metric system.In a further Administrative Memorandum of October 1969 theDepartment indicated the progress made in introducing teachingin metric terms in the further education sector, and drew theattention of schools to the need for pupils to become increasinglyfamiliar with metric units.   At the same time the Departmentpublished a leaflet in its Education Information series giving further guidance and listing useful publications.   Eor the-schools, the Schools Council for-   --. Curriculum and Examinations(an independent body whose members are representative of all parts of the education service including the Department ofEducation and Science and the Welsh Office) gave preliminaryguidance in its booklet &quot;Change for a Pound&quot; published in 196::;.In February 1970 it published a booklet &quot;Measure for Measure: a.Guide to Metrication for Workshop Crafts and Technical Studier/&apos;,and in collaboration with the Metrication Board - it has recently
CONFIDENTIALpublished a guidance booklet for teachers in primary schoolscalled &quot;Metres, Litres and Grams&quot;.    Also, the Council circulatedwidely in 1969 a paper setting out the arrangements made bythe schools examining bodies for the introduction into theirexaminations of questions in decimal currency and metric units.Representatives of the examining bodies have indicated thatthe phasing of examinations is continually under review and have emphasised their intention -to keep pace in setting examinationswith the rate of change towards the metric system in industry,commerce and other sectors.86     In the further education sector, where courses and examinationsare closely linked with the requirements of particular sectors of industry and commerce, clearer indication of phasing cangenerally be given.    In a Circular Letter of March 1968 theDepartment of Education and Science invited all relevant bodies concerned with examinations and syllabuses in this sector toconsider, when each sector-of-industry programme was published,what consequential changes would be needed, how and when these could most appropriately be introduced,and to take steps to informcolleges of their intention.   This suggestion has been fullyimplemented with the result that the necessary information has gone to the colleges, which have been able to act on it.Developments in Scotland87     In 1968 the Scottish Education Department published twoCurriculum Papers.No U:   Going Metric:    Implications for the Primary SchoolNo 5:   Going Metric:    Implications for Secondary schools the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board, for anumber of years, has been progressively extending the use of the confidential
International System of Units in its examination papers.    Theyare now being exclusively used in Physics (Alternative Syllabus),Applied Mathematics, Dynamics, Engineering Science and AppliedMechanics, and will be used in virtually all papers on both theOrdinary and Higher grades by 1973.    In further education steady progress has been made towards providing for the needs ofmetrication in step with the appropriate industries.    Manyexaminations and corresponding teaching, especially in science,engineering and construction7are now. or soon will be completelyconverted to the use of the International System.    Others aretemporarily providing dual questions or alternative papers where necessary.Industrial training-$8    Particular industries are adopting metric practice at different rates and it is a task of the Industrial TrainingBoards to meet and anticipate the needs of their particularsectors.   The Standing Joint Committee of Industrial TrainingBoards, with the help of the Metrication Board, has been responsible for coordinating the       ; . - . work of theseBoards.    The Committee has initiated a series of training texts:these fall into three categories - Information Documents ,Basic Learning Texts and Specialised Learning Texts, and are for general use across industry.   There is also the trainingguidance developed by individual training boards, notably theprogrammed learning and visual aids of the Construction IndustryTraining Board and literature such as the Engineering IndustryTraining Board1s &quot;Going Metric - Introducing Common Metric Units&quot;.Experience has shown that the main training problems  have been  in&apos;       -     . i &quot;acquiring familiarity with new British Standards at the confidential
*n fate,supervisory and. sub-professional levels and in drawing offices.The degree of retraining required will vary from one company toanother depending upon their activities and products and the pace at which the industry is changing to metric usage.   Atlower levels the amount of retraining needed by an individual is usually small.
Change to the Metric System in the United Kingdom.Reportof the Standing Joint Committee on Metrication.   HMSO 1968Hansard (Commons) Vol 769, Col 1167 - 1171Hansard (Commons) Vol 782, Col 215(W). and Vol 78h, Col ol-82(W)IX       THE METRICATION BOARDS9     The Standing Joint Committee on Metrication reported inMay 1968 and recommended that an organisation was needed tocoordinate the sector plans for the country as a whole andthat only an organisation such as a Metrication Board couldfulfil this role.1   In July 1968 the then government announced their acceptance of the recommendation to establish a Metrication Board:&quot;to guide, stimulate and coordinate the planning forthe transition for the various sectors of the economy.Every sector of the economy need not move at the samepace.    But there will be unnecessary confusion and expense, and great difficulties for industry, unless there is central machinery for coordinating the,programmes of change for the various sectors.&quot;Industry, notably the Confederation of British Industry, theCouncil of Engineering Institutions, the British standards institution and the Royal Society had maue strong representations on the need for such an organisation.90     In a written answer, Parliament was informed in April,andMay 1969 of the appointment of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman,3the Director and Members of the Board.     Thef irst meetingOf the Board was held on 28 May 1969.    The pattern of organisationdeveloped by the Board has been followed by a number of commonwealth countries who are now in the process of changingto metric.   An account of the Board&apos;s work since May 1969 isto be found in its two Reports, &quot;Going Metric., the First Five
CONFIDENTIALYears 1965-69&quot; published in Hay 1970 and &quot;Going Metric:   Progressin 1970&quot; published in April 1971.191     These reports indicate the complexity and far-reachingcharacter of the changes now in progress.   So far they have chieflybeen of concern to industry and this has determined what has beenthe principal objective of the Metrication Board&apos;s programmes bothin publicity and in coordination.   The Confederation of BritishIndustry and the Board are particularly concerned to keep the smallbusinessman informed about the change and its implications.   Buthenceforth the changes will increasingly have an impact on dailylife.   The Metrication Board has now decided with the Government&apos;approval to set up a Steering Committee for Distribution and consumer interests to consider and advise on all aspects of the metric change which will have an effect on the consumer.   It willwork closely with the Steering Committee for Consumer GoodsIndustries.   It will be concerned that effective measures are takenby the Board, through the media of publicity, to inform the publicof what is happening and why, and the extent to which the changes maybe expected to affect the individual in his daily life.92    The Board has no power to require anybody either to make or to implement programmes.   Efficient programming can only be undertaken by individuals who have a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of thetrade concerned and who will be responsible for implementing it.   TheBoard1s function is to give general help, advice and information tothose who have the responsibility;   its formal duties are defined inits terms of reference.93    The Government have reviewed the working of the MetricationThe Board&apos;s membership, terms of reference, staff and costs are set out in Annex III.
Board and have concluaea that the reasons which led to its establishment are still valid.   The complex nature of the changes taking place make it necessary to have an efficientcentre of communication to relate and coordinate the manyprogrammes.    No other organisation can take a comprehensiveview of the switch to the metric system and relate it to the pace at which people can accept the change.9k.    The Board has relied heavily on the voluntary and muchvalued contribution of many people from many walks of life, towhom the Government are grateful.    The efficient conduct bythe Board of the difficult tasks of coordination andcommunication depends upon this public cooperation that is soessential to a change of this character. The Government hopethat all organisations will keep the Metrication Board fully informed of all moves that will affect substantial numbers of people.95    The Board has learned much from other countries&apos;experience, and has been able to offer aavice in the light of experience in this country.    It will continue to have animportant role in ensuring the smooth progress of metricationwithin the United Kingdom and in maintaining the necessary and close liaison with developments overseas.
CONFIDENTIALX     COSTS AND BENEFITS96    The change to metric units in so many parts of industry has gone forward, as other parts of this paper explain, atindustry&apos;s own inspiration.   Industry would not have led theway unless it considered that the changeover would help it inexport markets and, through rationalisation, keep costs down.The increasing speed of change therefore can he taken as an indication of industry&apos;s assessment of its value.97    Almost always when a factory or an industry goes metricother related changes are also made, such as a rationalisation of the dimensions or of the range of products manufactured, ora substantial redesign or retooling.   In some cases, as in a firm producing screws, metrication may be the occasion to rationalise the range of products.   In other more complicatedlines the need to redesign arises and the opportunity is takento go metric.   Sometimes these related changes may be extensiveand costly but they are not undertaken unless they are judgedto result in benefits which sufficiently exceed the costs tomake the expenditure worthwhile.   Much depends on the timing of the change:   capital equipment seldom needs to be replacedsolely because of changing to the metric system, and the costs of its adaptation to metric should not be high.   The change tometric may however prompt a reassessment of the comparativeefficiency of different types of machines.   How to exploit the metric change so as to incur the lowest costs and securethe maximum benefits is one of the major problems of thechangeover for each organisation.
Assessing the cost       CONFIDENTIAL96    Partly because going metric is so often just a part ofa wider change, and partly because for understandable reasonsmany firms regard their costings as confidential,  there areavailable very few assessments of costs prepared by individual firms.   And the few that are available are not comparable one with another, because different firms have use a differentcriteria.    The actual costs depend on a wide range of events and decisions throughout the period of the change, and in manycases these decisions have yet to be taken.   There is of coursean immense variety of undertakings.    It is not possible toaggregate or to make worthwhile generalisations from the fewcosts for particular undertakings that are known.   There havebeen several unofficial estimates of the global cost ofmetrication never supported by any statistical evidence.   Nowell-founded estimate exists or could exist.&apos;9-9    None of the countries which has changed to the metricsystem, or decided to do so in recent years, has made anestimate of the total cost of the change; doubtless for reasons which are similar to those which make it impossible to qo so for the United Kingdom.   The United States Metric Study Reportstates that it&quot;sought estimates of benefits and costs from trade associations, labor unions, business firms, governmentagencies, educators, importers and exporters and others in a position to have first hand knowledge of theirfields......The ideal outcome of this procedure would have been a simple aggregate figure.......... representing the netbenefit (or cost) to the nation of going metric undera coordinated national plan......This conceptually simple approach was not feasible.First, few of the groups from whom benefit and costdata were solicited were able to furnish them.    Second,the benefits and costs are not directly comparable,inasmuch as they would occur at different times.Virtually all the costs would be incurred during the transition period, at a time when benefits were just
A Metric America. A decision whose time has come. USGovernment Printing Office July 1971beginning.   Most of the benefits would come after the transition.   Third, the majority of benefit and costitems are basically elusive - perhaps even unknowablein dollar terms.   As was pointed out above, some areintangible;   others cannot be attributed purely to*a metric change&apos;.&quot;   1100     Such evidence as is available from individual undertakings in the United Kingdom indicates that the expenditure will notbe heavy.   Many leading industrial firms have now changed or have planned the change in detail and are in the process of implementing their plans.   Only a very few organisations havemade their budgets available and they have emphasised that,for some or all of the reasons outlined above, the figures aremaxima and are very approximate.   The chemical industry, expectedto be selling 85$ of its output in metric terms by the end of1971* estimates the cost at  6m spread over a period of aboutseven years.   This is approximately 0.25 per cent of theindustry&apos;s anticipated total capital investment programme on new plant and equipment over the same period.   Among thosefirms who have made figures available, a group which has anannual turnover of  450m expects the gross costs spread over aperiod of seven years to be in the region of  1.4m, orapproximately 0.04 per cent of turnover.   A smaller engineeringcompany with a turnover of  1m per annum has estimated its fullcosts at  19t500, which even if spent in one year, represents alittle less than 2 per cent of turnover.   Another major company with an annual turnover of more than  325m expects the grosscost of a very comprehensive change to be about  1m.   Even ifspent in one year this represents 0.3 per cent of turnover.
The company has found that it is already making annual savings of approximately the same order and that there is the prospectof appreciable recurring annual gains.   Another group with aturnover approaching  70m has computed the costs at its majorplants at  55*000 or less than 0.1 per cent of turnover.
Benefits101   The US Metric Study Report in concluding its lengthysection on benefits and costs said:   &quot;the analysis of benefits and costs made in this chapter confirms the intuitive judgementof US business and industry that increasing the use of the metric system is in the best interests of the country (theUnited States) and that this should be done through a coordinated!national program.&quot;   As indicated above, this view is even moreapplicable to the United Kingdom.   It is the view of organisedindustry, in which the Government concur, that the acceptanceof metric units       is a prerequisite for British industry as awhole if it is to continue to compete effectively in world markets in future decades.102   The nation must also consider the costs of not goingmetric.   These include the cost of continuing to operate twosystems.    If the United Kingdom were to retain the imperialsystem, while at the same time having to use metric to an increasing extent for international trade, British industry wouldbe less efficient and less competitive and the higher costs wouldbe cumulative.   This would have repercussions on the standardof living and we would have burdened ourselves with an economichandicap.The importance of correct timing103   la all industries the actual costs and benefits depend uponthe timing of the changeover to metric.   The costs of a quickand radical change would be high,as would the costs of aprotracted and unplanned change,but direct costs can be reduced,sometimes almost to zero, by a phased introduction of metricequipment, be it machine tools or plastic containers.    In any
event, the costs are transitory.   But once the change is made the&quot;benefits last indefinitely.   Also the potential losses of stayingimperial mount cumulatively in the loss of markets and customergoodwill if the change is unduly delayed.10k  The experience of all firms and industries which have carried out the change is that there is an optimum time for it when the balance of advantage is greatest.   However thisoptimum varies from firm to firm and depends on many factors,some of them internal, such as the life-span and age ofexisting plant;   some of them external, such as the plans ofsuppliers and customers.105   Some guidelines based upon external trends are essential,and to provide these in some detail in conjunction with industryis one of the principal functions of the Metrication Board.Likewise, a broad target date is desirable to promote thecoordination of different industries&apos; plans, as emphasised bythe Hodgson Committee in 1951 and the Standing Joint Committeeon Metrication in 1968.   The latter advocated a target date ofthe end of 1975 (see paragraph k5).Government costs106   The immediate costs in Government departments will be absorbed within the normal provisions for management &amp;nd staff.107   The most expensive operation within the field of public administration will be the conversion of all road signs showingmiles (or mph) to kilometres (or kph).   The cost of conversionof all road speed signs is likely to be about  2m and of all
/Hansard (Commons)   Vol 808 Col h17-hl807 * vUdj[road signs indicating distance appreciably more.    Unlike the changing of distance signs, where phasing is practicable, thechange of&quot; speed limit signs mast be done as one major operation.It had previously been proposed that speed limits should, bemade metric in 1973 but on 9 jecemoer 1970 the Minister for transport Industries announced in Parliament that this wouldnot be done and that the Government haa no alternative date in mind.     The change of speed and distance signs to metricunits will need to be considered in detail, but not for someyears.
108-   The greater part of our legislation still employs imperialunits in cases where reference to weight, length or otherdimensions is called for.   But the progress of the metricsystem within industry, as described in Chapter V, means thatthose parts of this legislation which have an impact on industry will need, at least by 1975, to have been adapted for use withina metric setting.   There is a great deal of statute law,subordinate legislation, and       local and private acts and bye-laws which falls into this category.    Some of this legislation is no impediment to going metric.   And there are provisions ofthe Weights and Measures Act 1963 which afford a statutory basis for effecting uniform conversions from most imperial units to metric, which can be employed in some cases.109   But there is other legislation for which the use of conversionfactors is not satisfactory and which constitutes a barrier tothe adoption of the metric system in industry, though most ofit is of little concern to the general public.   For example,  somepressure gauges in factories are required by the Factories Act,-1961,&apos; to indicate pressure in pounds per square inch:    theAlkali etc, Works Regulation Act, 1906, requires atmosphericpollution to be expressed in grains per cubic foot, and theGeneral Rate Act, 1967, uses the therm as the basis of rateable value of certain properties within the gas industry.    similar problems exist in legislation for agriculture and its alliedindustries.   The Government propose to legislate to remove thesebarriers in public acts and in subordinate legislation, whereCONFIDENTIALXI    LEGISLATION
necessary.   This will only he done after consultation, and taking account of particular difficulties of timing which affectcertain of these industries.   The precise form which such legislation may take has still to he decided.110   The purport of the e.c. directive on units of measurementissued by the Council of Ministers in October 1971, and an assessment of its effect, are given in Chapter III.    One of itschief consequences will be that the definitions and descriptions of units contained in it will have to be incorporated in ourdomestic law where this has not yet been done.    It will benecessary, among other things, to amend the definition of thelitre made under the Weights and Measures Act so that itaccords with that internationally recognised (a thousandth ofa cubic metre).    When the directive is fully implemented inthe United Kingdom it will be necessary to ensure that our law relating to trade and industry is properly adapted for theuse of metric units, but progress in this field will, as mentioned above, by then be well advanced as a consequenceof the adoption of metric measures by industry.111,   The particular modifications to the Weights and MeasuresAct 1963 which will be needed to permit the sale of metricsize packages are dealt with in Chapter VI and in more detail
in Annex II.  To summarise, subordinate legislation will &quot;be needed to provide a suitable alternative range of metric quantitiefor the sale, when prepacked, of butter,  sugar and the otherfoods described as &quot;shopping bag items&quot; in the Annex.   Thelegal requirements for their sale would be in other respectsunaltered.   Regulations would also be needed to provide thatthe metric weight or capacity should be stated alongside theimperial equivalent on those prepacked goods now required tobear a statement of weight or capacity in imperial units.   Furthersubordinate legislation would he introduced if necessary:a. to allow,  in parallel with the existing imperial units,draught beer, cider, gin, whisky, and the otheralcoholic beverages whose sale is regulated by the.  Weights and Measures Act 1963 to be sold in litresor the appropriate sub-multiples of a litre forconsumption on the premises;    and b. to require cleap identification of,  the metric rangesin cases where the law prescribes alternative metricand imperial ranges of quantities for prepackedcommodities./T12   The Government would be ready to take any necessary powers to implement measures to protect consumers, eg by the introductionof unit pricing^
WHITE PAPER ON METRICATIONA copy of the e.c. Directive on Units of Measurement (Directive7l/35h) will here he included.
ANNEX IIPREPACKED EOODS AND THE &quot;-EIGHTS ANT MEASURES ACTIntroduction1       It is explained in paragraph 6h of the White Paper thatthere is active and increasing international interest in theprescribing by Governments of standard package sizes of many ofthe most commonly used foodstuffs;    some sizes have been prescribed in Great Britain since 1926.   The present legislative basis isSection 21 of the Weights and Measures Act 1963.   The supportingprovisions for various commodities are contained in Schedules h to 8of the Act and in various Orders and Regulations subsequently madeunder its powers.2       Schedule h, covering foodstuffs,  is of most concern in this context.    Unless a commodity is separately covered in theschedule - as is the case with the more basic foodstuffs includingmeat, butter,  sugar, fish, cheese, milk and bread or is specificallyexempted - it may only be sold prepacked if marked with an indication of quantity either by net weight or by capacity.Regulations require that this should be in imperial units (subject,to a few minor exceptions).    There are additionally many special provisions, which vary in detail and scope, relating to individualproducts and groups of products and there are many exemptions fromthe stated provisions relating to very small quantities offered for individual sale and for some other specialised products.   From thisintricate legislative web the following distinguishes four of themore important strands contained in Schedule h and disregards any specific exemptions:-
a    Items which when prepacked may be sold only in certain specified imperial weights which must be marked on thepacket.   This group includes many of the basic &quot;shopping-bag items&quot; such as butter, margarine, sugar, tea, coffee,jam, salt, and breakfast cereals in flake form.b    Items v/hich may be sold only when the container bears an indication of quantity by number.   This provision relates to such foods as eggs, and breakfast cereals in biscuit form.c     Items which may be sold only by net weight, or alternativelyby gross weight where any wrapping or container does notexceed a specified weight.   This provision generally applies to meat, fish, poultry, cheese and those soft fruits andmushrooms generally offered for sale in punnets.d     Canned fruits and bottled and canned liquid foodstuffs suchas beer, soft drinks, soups and sauces are generallyrequired to bear a statement of quantity by imperialcapacity measurement.International developments3    Although prescribed package sizes as laid down by ourlegislation are a valuable aid to consumer protection, they alsotend to hinder international trade.   This is particularly so ifdifferent countries stipulate different package sizes.   Themultiplicity of sizes has the effect of raising costs in processingand transport:   it inhibits ^competition and ultimately the price to the buyer is higher.
CONFIDENTIALIt ir desirable to further the flow of international trade and theonly way this can be done consistently with this form ofprotection to the consumer is to achieve the maximum degree ofinternational agreement on package sizes.   Both e.c. and efta countries are moving towards the harmonisation of package sizes4    The most important international expression of opinion onthis subject was the recommendation in December 1970 by the tripartite Committee on Standardisation.   The united view ofthe UK, French and West German delegations was that:-MThe Tripartite Committee for Standardisation recommends that, in order to facilitate international trade inprepackaged, solid foodstuffs for the retail trade,member countries prescribing a range of sizes, whichare either mandatory or preferred, should adopt, asfar as possible, the following range25g 50g 125g 250g 500g 1kg 2kg 3kg 4kg 5kgThe Tripartite Committee also recommends that at least for a transitional period, the length of which shouldbe agreed in relation to each individual product,provision should be made for the following sizes:-75g   375g  750g   1.5kg.&quot;In agreeing the recommendation the participants took full account of the views of consumer organisations.5    Numerous other countries, such as Switzerland, South Africa,and various parts of the USA, have introduced laws on prescribedsizes:   some, such as South Africa, have used the Tripartiterecommendation as their basis.   So far the recommendation hasnot been implemented by any of the present members of the EECbut it may be confidently expectedthat it will have much influence on their thinking.   Thereforeif our food manufacturers wish to sell prepacked foodstuffs in overseas countries they will increasingly have to pack them insizes conforming to local legislation.   It is very probable thatCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmarkets for products conforming to these ranges will expandwhilst others will contract.6 -    The directive on units of measurement is designed, asindicated in paras 28-32 to facilitate trade between the membersof e.c..    It will, after the five years&quot;allowed for its implement-tation  have an important bearing on our existing legislationabout prescribed packages and the statement of quantities.We should then have to be ready to open oxir markets to&quot;shopping bag items&quot; packed in metric quantities but we shouldbe at liberty to prescribe a realistic series of metric packsacceptable to us and to refuse to authorise the sale of thesefoods in quantities other than those (whether metric or imperial)permitted under our domestic regulations.   Vve should also haveto amend the law so that a statement of the contents of a tin orbottle of foodstuffs (other than those covered by more exactingrequirements or those exempted under the Act) must be statedin the appropriate metric unit as well as in the eqitivalentimperial unit.    The freedom of entry to the UK that foodstuffsprepared and packed elsewhere in the e.c. would enjoy would ofcourse offer as its counterpart enhanced opportunities to british firms to sell their products in Europe.    But our goods soldabroad will equally have to comply with the local legislation,including where appropriate laws imposing prescribed metricquantities.The effect on home manufacturers7      The British food processing industry is certainly not lessadvanced than are the parallel indiistries elsewhere in Europe andit is most desirable that it should be given an opportunity to
CONFIDENTIALcompete effectively in a wider market.    It would be gravelyhandicapped if it were obliged to adhere to imperial size packsin the home market.    It is therefore much in the interest of the manufacturer that he should make an early change to those of the tripartite Committee&apos;s recommendations that are appropriate tohis particular foodstuffs.   He should not defer the change untilthe effect of the directive is about to be felt.8      At present the provisions of the Weights and Measures Actgenerally restrict him to the approved imperial sizes:    somefew foodstuffs such as jam are sold abroad in equivalent metricsizes but for the most part our present domestic sizes are not inpractice acceptable to overseas buyers even when permitted bytheir laws.    The Act will have to be modified to permit the useof suitable metric sizes, which are likely in most cases to bedrawn from the Tripartite range.    In preparing the necessary orders and Regulations Government will have to act in close consultation with representatives of manufacturers,distributors &quot;and   consumers to ensure that all their interests are taken duly into account.9       The provisions of, and the timing of, these Orders and regulations form only one part, though a very important part, ofthe procedure of introducing these new sizes of packagedfoodstuffs.    Once manufacturers have decided on their introduction,they will need to make further decisions c^n the timing of the transition.    The need for the conversion of packaging and fillingmachinery varies widely with the product and a reasonable time must be allowed for the conversion.    Stocks of products in theold sizes must be run down.    Different transition periods withinthe agreed broad framework will be necessary for differentprodticts.   Careful planning by industry on a timetable in orderto keep the costs of the change down and to minimise the effect a,   CONFIDENTIAL     , ,    .on the consumer is therefore necessary for each product.
CONFIDENTIALA phased programme in which the changes in size are madecommodity by commodity should make it easier for shoppers to accommodate themselves to the changes.10     Changes in size have already taken place in some non-foodindustries, where no legislation prescribing quantities exists,and are now being extended further.   For example the paintindustry has determined on a series of standard sizes of 100,250 and 500 millilitre tins and 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 litre drums.This range was published as a British Standard in 1970.   It isthe European range of sizes agreed in negotiations and is likelyto become the universal range.   The purpose is to standardisethe units of sale and the package dimensions, and the standardisedunits are metric.   The new quantities are generally within about10 per cent of our traditional quantities.   For example thebuilder who previously bought a one gallon drum of paint will buya 5 litre drum, which is 10 per cent larger.   The householder whopreviously bought a pint will buy a 500 millilitre can, which is approximately 12 per cent smaller.   Cement will normally be sold in 50 kilogramme bags (1 cwt = about 50.8kg), less than 2 percent smaller than the present size.Proposed amendments to the Weights and Measures Act11     So that manufacturers can use metric as well as imperialunits the Government propose to proceed by order using the powers under Section 21 of the Weights and Measures Act, 1963, to enablethe quantities of the &quot;shopping-bag items&quot; to be prescribed inround metric units.   These Orders will be similar to the weights and Measures Act (Amendment of Schedules 5 and 7) Order 1970,which made it lawful to sell sand and ballast in either metric orimperial measures.-&apos;&quot; &quot; &quot; confidential Hansard (Commons) Vol 805 Col 797-810
The Government will only proceed with such Orders after full consultation with manufacturers, distributors and consumers as required by Section 54 of the Act.   All such Orders will be laidbefore Parliament in draft and be subject to affirmative resolutiThis subordinate legislation would allow units of sale to be specified in round metric units while still permitting the useof units of sale prescribed in round imperial units.12     Both the food manufacturing industry and organisationsrepresenting consumers have stressed that it will be necessaryto set a term to the period during which certain of thesefoodstuffs are on sale in both imperial and metric quantities.This could not be done under the Weights and Measures Act andwould require new legislation.   The Government do not see a need to introduce such legislation in the immediate future.They cannot however rule out that there may be a need toconsider again the question of such legislation in the light of future discussion with the food manufacturing and retailingindustries and with consumer interests.13    As mentioned in paragraphs of this Annex, foodstuffs not covered by more precise and detailed requirements must have thev/eight or the capacity of the contents clearly marked in imperialmeasures.   The metric equivalent may also be marked, and alreadyfrequently is.   The Government propose to make Regulations underSection 21 of the Act requiring the metric weight or capacity tobe shown on such bottles, cans or packages in addition to theimperial measure.   They also hope that where convenient the foodindustry will progressively adopt the use of round metric
quantities, normally those of the appropriate British standardor international recommendation (for example those of Tripartite)for their containers and packages.   The imperial equivalent ofthe metric weight or capacity will have to he stated.
