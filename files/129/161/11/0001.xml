THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 1126 January 1972RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES IN THE SUPPLY of professional services memorandum by the Lord chancellor. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry^ memorandum cp(72) 9 recommends the application of the existing restrictive practiceslegislation, with only minor modifications, to cover restrictive practices in services provided by all professions other than the legal profession.I believe this proposal to be fundamentally mistaken on the following grounds:a. It is unnecessary:  other and adequate machinery is available.b. In its present form the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956is not the appropriate instrument to control professional services.c. While I think the Secretary of State is correct in his belief that the procedure applied to the legal profession would give riseto insuperable difficulties, I do not believe its exclusion when allother professions are included would be acceptable to Parliament.d. The proposal would antagonise all the professions, whowould regard it as a direct attack on their integrity and independence,and it would not lead to any important economic advantages to compensate for the political opposition it would axouse.2,        The restrictive practices in the professions which are the mainsubject of substantial criticism are those whereby scale fees are chargedand undercutting is prohibited.    These practices can already be referred tothe Monopolies Commission, and prohibited thereafter by Order.    If it is desired to exercise any\greater degree of control over them, the right course is to make use of the Commission and, if need be, to extend its scope and enlarge the powers of the Secretary of State to act on its reports.I see no reason why it should be necessary to refer each profession to theCommission in turn as the Secretary of State appears to suggest inparagraph 2 of CP(72) 9.copy NO62CABINET
3.        Professional practices (even if the legal profession is excluded)raise issues different in kind from those raised by restrictive agreementsrelating to the supply of goods or commercial services.    The issues raised by the latter are entirely economic: professional practices, on theother hand, raise questions of social and political judgment and, ifdefensible, are defensible on quite different grounds.    It would, in myopinion, be inappropriate to ask a Court to determine whether restrictionson advertising accepted by doctors and architects confer on the publicbenefits outweighing any possible disadvantages.    That is a decision of social and political judgment appropriate for the Government to make and parliament to decide.    I disagree with the proposition underlyingparagraph 2 of CP(72) 9 that, in order to avoid controversy, it is appropriate to place on a court of law a responsibility which it is the dutyof Government to take.    Certainly the issues would be controversial, butwe are here to settle controversial issues.4. The Secretary of State&apos;s proposal is not only fundamentally wrong,but also politically unwise.    The professions attach great importance totheir independence and right to be self-governing, which has enabled themto make contributions of immense value to the orderly development of oursociety.    They will resent strongly having to submit the practices on&apos;which they believe their integrity depends to the arbitrament of a court oflaw and they will make their resentment felt both in and outsideParliament.    We must remember that many of our staunchest supportersare to be found among the professions and that they have an influence outof all proportion to their numbers.    Moreover, as a matter of practicalcommonsense, I do not believe it wise to embark at this moment, when weare up against so many Parliamentary difficulties, on the task of pilotingthrough both Houses legislation which is bound to be complex and unpopularin the face of opposition which will be both vocal and expert.5. The proposal to make a specific and solitary exception in the caseof the legal profession would incur strenuous opposition.    On the other :hand, a failure to make such an exception would be equally unacceptable.Solicitors1 charges have come in for vigorous criticisms, some of whichI sharej in particular, their rule of practice whereby the scale feesauthorised by the statutory Committee are required to be treated asminima seems to me to be wholly unjustifiable.    Yet these practices areeach and all sanctioned by Act of Parliament and would have to be excluded if the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal were accepted.    It is, on theother hand, impossible to exclude Solicitors while including the Bar.    i therefore accept the unsuitability of the proposals in their application to thelegal profession.    But if we were to exclude the legal profession I believe this would merely serve to underline the unsuitability of the restrictive practices Court as an instrument of control over other professions.    If,on the other hand, we were to include the legal profession I believe theresults would be equally unacceptable.    It would, for instance be utterlywrong to ask the Court to decide whether the continuance of the Bar as anindependent profession was to be permitted or whether (contrary to thewishes of the Bar and the great majority of Solicitors) fusion should be forced upon them.    I certainly could not defend legislation which had suchan effect.2
6. I would suggest to my colleagues that the 1956 Act is fundamentallyunsuitable for at least most of the Secretary of State&apos;s present purposes.That Act was carefully designed to fit the supply of goods.    It may be practicable to adapt it to cover the supply of some commercial services,but in my view it is not suitable in anything like its current form for thecontrol of services of every kind, ranging from laundries to accountants,and from garages to doctors.    This indeed was the conclusion of the monopolies Commission itself as recently as 1970 when it reported thatservices could not be brought within the scope of the 1956 Act &quot;unless the criteria for judging practices and the formulation of any appropriatepresumptions had been defined much more precisely than is possible atpresent&quot;.    (Cmnd 4463, paragraph 354).    This is exactly what the present proposals have not done and this is their fundamental vice,7.        I have the authority of the English Law Officers to say that they agree with my views.H cf St MHouse of Lords26 January 19723
