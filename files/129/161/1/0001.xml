(I    (    &quot;7^TfflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 1 COPY NO      g26 January 1972CABINETA SECOND SERVICE OF INDEPENDENT TELEVISION:AND CONTROL OVER THE NUMBER OF HOURSOF broadcasting memorandum by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications1. The Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting considered on13 December a submission (annexed) from the Independent television authority (ITA) in favour of a second service of independent television(ITV 2).2. The ITA contend that two complementary services would offer a wider choice to their audiences, and the various groups within them, thanone;  that the existing service does not fully employ the human andmaterial resources at present available within the programme companies;and that it is unfair that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) shouldhave two programmes while ITV has only one.    They envisage that thefirst transmission of ITV 2 might, if approved now, start in 1974.3. But, in my memorandum, I noted:i.    much of the additional advertising revenue for ITV 2,estimated by the ITA at about  14 million a year, would come from the national Press, who would see themselves a     as seriously endangered by it;  and the Newspaper PublishersAssociation, the Newspaper Society and the National Union of journalists have all told me that for this reason they are strongly against it;ii.    the ITA proposals are also opposed by the advertising industryand by many of our own supporters, who want a competingrather than complementary second ITV service;iii.    the diversion of ITA&apos;s engineering resources to the setting upof ITV 2 would inevitably slow down the joint BBC/ITAprogramme for extending the three existing BBC and ITAservices to less well-served areas;
iv.     ITV 2 would reduce the profits of independent television and hence entail pressure for reduction of the levy;v.     and even if it eventually proves right to have an ITV 2, thereis much to be said, especially at a time when we already have more television than any other Western Europeancountry, for deferring a decision until decisions need to betaken about the whole future shape of radio and television broadcasting after 1976 (when the 1964 Television Act andthe BBC charter both expire).4. The Ministerial Committee unanimously concluded that the ITA&apos;scase for immediate allocation of ITV 2 was not made out.5. There is however another matter on which we could give somesatisfaction to the ITA.    The Authority propose that I should now abandon the present Ministerial control over the hours of broadcasting.    Apartfrom some practical arguments, there is a strong argument of principleagainst this kind of detailed Governmental control.    It would be as well to,insist that there should still be no breakfast-time television, which might seriously harm the national Press.    The ITA would be prepared to give an assurance on that point, and as the formal powers would remain on thestatute book, we could ensure that the stipulation was fulfilled.    Providedthat satisfactory assurances on this can be obtained from the ITA and the bbc, the Ministerial Committee agreed with me that, if the ITA were not given a second programme, we should agree that the control of hoursshould be lifted.6. I invite my colleagues to agree that I should make an early announcement that we have decided:i.     not to allocate frequency channels for the fourth programme with a view to its starting before 1976;ii .   that control over the number of hours of broadcastingshould now be abolished.C J c ministry of Posts and Telecommunications6 January 19722
ITV 2A SUBMISSION TO THEMINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONSBY THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITYDECEMBER 1971
ForewordThis submission gives the Authority&apos;s considered views about the useof the fourth UHF television channel in this country.It proposes that there should be a fourth television service and thatit should form part of the Independent Television system; that there shouldbe no additional programme companies appointed as a result of the intro-duction of this ITV 2; that there should be closer involvement by the ITAin the programme planning processes of the combined Independent television programmes, both streams of which would operate in relation to each otheron a complementary and non-competitive basis; and that a two-service ITVsystem should provide freer access to the national audience for programmesfrom all sources, including Independent Television^ regional companies and outside producing agencies.The Authority&apos;s interest is solely that of improving the service, andit bases its proposal that there should be a second Independent Televisionchannel upon the wider range of programming which could then be broadcast.ITV 1 has had marked success in providing programmes that are attractive.An ITV 2 would unquestionably enlarge the range available to the audienceas a whole. It would also benefit sections of the total audience who haveparticular interests which cannot often be catered for, at least in peak time,within the confines of a single service.Competition between two public services, one financed through licence revenue and the other supported by advertising, is something which hasstrengthened television since it was first introduced in the mid-1950s. Corn-petition on equal terms between the same services, each with two complement-ary television channels, should improve the service given.The Authority has not confined its discussions to the question of asecond Independent Television channel; it has also looked at other possibilities, as is explained later. Its firm conclusion is that the viewers&apos;interest will best be served by a second ITV service of the kind described.The argument is now developed in detail under the following headings:I. General ConsiderationsII. Background to the Present ProposalsIII. The Case for a Second ITV ServiceIV. ITV 2 Complementary to and Not Competitive with ITV 1V. The Programme PossibilitiesVI. The Reactions of the ITV CompaniesVII. Alternative PossibilitiesVIII. Possible Arrangements for ITV 2IX. A New Programme Planning Board for the NetworkX. Freer Access to the National AudienceXI. Financial Prospects of ITV 2XII. The Timing of ITV 2
I. General Considerations1. Television is the most popular of leisure activities, and in many ways themost powerful. Demands of all kinds are made upon it and rightly: that itshould entertain, divert, and interest us (all fifty million of us) when we wantrelaxation; and that it should enlarge our range of knowledge, experience,and awareness, so that we grow as individuals and as members of society.2. To do all this demands a balance of the most delicate kind, as a broad-casting service seeks both to entertain and to contribute something to our experience and knowledge. If it tries only to please, it is only using part ofthe medium&apos;s potential. If it tries only to contribute and to educate, thenagain, whatever praise it may gain from the critic, it is wasting a great oppor-tunity; for those who have fewest other resources for equipping themselves with wider and deeper interests will switch away. A competitive climatestrengthens the broadcasters will to connect with large audiences throughentertaining and interesting them; a climate where there is some shelterfrom competition strengthens his power to contribute.3. If it wants to strike a balance successfully, a broadcasting service needsboth a competitive stimulus and the knowledge that it does not have to compete all the time and at each point of the output. If it is to combinerecreation and public service for a very wide range of viewers, it needselbow-room. The BBC, to the advantage of us all as listeners and viewers,has the elbow-room which comes from a multi-channel operation bothin radio and television; the Government of the day, in authorizing BBC 2,called it &quot;one directly effective way of giving the viewer a choice of different types of programme, including more programmes of an educational andinformative nature, or drawn from regional sources&quot;. To provide a more extensive range of service to the viewer, we ask that Independent Televisionshould be given comparable freedom.4. The Authority seeks this freedom because it has a duty to providetelevision broadcasting services as a public service for disseminating informa-tion, education and entertainment. With this duty placed upon it, theAuthority must, whenever it thinks it desirable to do so, put forward sugges-tions for improving the quality and range of the service it can offer. At thepresent time, it is suggesting to Government that it can make suchimprovement possible in two ways: by removing outside restrictions on thelength of time during which Independent Television can be on the air, andby the authorization of a second service. These two approaches have a single and similar aim, the broadening of ITVs range. A derestriction of hours would be of immediate advantage, since it could take effect without any need to wait for fresh transmitters to be built. Its benefits, though substantial,would however not apply to all viewers, but to those who find themselvesable to watch television during the day. A second service would enable theprogramme range to be extended at the times when it matters most themain evening hours. Both of these changes seem to the Authority most desirable if it is to implement fully the duty laid on it by Parliament the running of a high quality television service which exploits to the full the potential of the country&apos;s principal mass medium.
II. Background to the Present proposals. Before 1970 the Authority had on a number of occasions considered thepossibility of a second ITV service. The first reference to the desirabilityof there being two services was made in 1955 in the Authority&apos;s first annual report. Then, in the first half of the 1960s, there were further expressions of interest in the subject both from the Authority&apos;s side and from the Govern-menfs. In its White Paper of December 1962 the Government of the day,in deferring any decision to authorise a second ITA programme, said thatit still felt such a programme might prove to be desirable in order to allowfull scope for Independent Television to offer more selection to viewersand to experiment. Up to this stage, the assumption was being made by theAuthority and by Government that both services would operate on a com-petitive basis and be run by different people.6. In the White Paper of December 1966, the Government of the dayannounced that there would be no allocation of frequencies to a fourthtelevision service for the following three years at any rate. In 1969 there wereinformal discussions with the Post Office about the possibility of ITV 2,but these were not pursued because of the serious financial position of independent Television in that year. The Authority continued to hope,however, that a second service could be authorised which would, by givingITV the same opportunities as the BBC had had since 1964, lead to a situation of parity, both of competition for the viewers and of ability to offer them afull range of programming, between the two separate public services of television in the United Kingdom.7. In 1970 the Authority and its Policy Committee gave fresh considerationto the question of ITV 2. For it was clear that, apart from the need for ITVto have sufficient funds for the provision of the best possible programmes(a need which led to representations about the Levy and to the Government^decision in this matter), the most important requirement of independent television was that it should be enabled to offer a wider range of service.Restricted hours and a single channel lead to frustrations for the viewerwho wants the same range on ITV as he can obtain from the BBCs twochannels, and frustration for the programme maker whose chance of innovations-ting and of providing for particular audiences is much reduced by the con-straints of a single channel. ITV is obliged, as it were, to cater for readersof The Guardian, The Express, and The Mirror, within the confines of asingle channel. It seemed to the Authority that the removal of these con-straints was, together with a derestriction of the permitted hours of broad-casting, essential if ITV was to improve and broaden its service during the1970s in the way that the Authority wished.8. In the course of its discussions, the Authority dwelt particularly on thefollowing points:(i) If the service given by ITV was to be broadened and was to cater for anumber of interests which we try not to neglect but which we cannotserve as adequately as we would wish, then the second service must becomplementary to the first and not competitive with it. All the evidence
suggested that competitive programming did not enlarge the range of choice: indeed, it tended to narrow it. Competition has its own advan-tages in sharpening effort and increasing attention to what the viewerwants; but this sharpness has already been brought into television bycompetition between ITV and BBC.(ii) ITV is already equipped with more facilities than the BBC and with amore disparate collection of creative enterprises. This is due to itsdeliberate decision to provide a federal and regional structure for independent Television^ service. But the result is an amount of pro-gramme production which, while consistent with the regional structure,is in total more than is needed for a minimum single-service output.Potentially, there exist the means of providing between two and three times the amount of material that a single channel requires. It is thereforeplain that any expansion of the service, relying (as it will have to rely)on quite small expansion in income, must make use of potential withinthe present structure for the most part, and not expect to duplicate thatstructure. The existence of this reserve meant that the Authority couldlook forward past the financial problems that then existed to a situationin which quite a small improvement in resources might make it possibleto start planning for a second channel.9. Since the Authority neither produces programmes nor sells advertising,the next step was to discuss with the companies actually producing the programmes of Independent Television such matters as the likelihood ofadditional revenue from ITV 2, what a complementary service might mean in terms of programme categories, what the extent and location of surplusstudios were, and the scope that there would be for increased regionalopportunities in a two-service situation. The Authority therefore decidedto set up a joint working party of members of the Standing consultative committee, drawn both from the Authority&apos;s staff and from the representa-tives of companies. This working party had six meetings between May and november 1971.10. It also seemed right, in a matter of such importance for the future of independent Television, that the views of those working in the industry should be canvassed in a more general way. The Authority therefore decidedto ask for ideas from within ITV generally, and from trade unions andsocieties with relevant membership, and to have these discussed at a Con-sultation towards the end of the year. In order that this discussion could befrank and positive, we decided that it should not be a public debate attended by the Press. The result of this arrangement was that a large number of questions were considered in fair detail and a range of useful views expressedby those who had experience of the working of Independent Televisionat all levels.11. The Authority also invited the views of its General Advisory Counciland its Educational Advisory Council; during its discussions, it has alsolearnt, through information gained by membership of the European Broad-casting Union and through staff visits, of the experience of other countrieswhich have more than one broadcasting service. In addition, it has takenaccount of the views of bodies representing the advertising industry, as given
both in informal discussions and through the Press, and it has also receivedthe views of a number of programme producers from outside independent television. These contacts, together with the Authority&apos;s interest in thecurrent Press discussion of this and other aspects of the future of broadcasting,mean that it has considered the various implications of any proposals for1TV2.12. Although the proposals are now being put forward after the collection and examination of a wide range of views and data the Authority has acceptedfrom the outset that it is for Government to set the proposals in perspectiveand to take a decision.III. The Case for a Second ITV Service13. The case for the introduction of a second service is based upon theprogramming restrictions which must exist in a single service. The authority is charged by Section 1(4) of the Television Act to provide &quot;a public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment&quot; and to secure&quot;a proper balance and wide range&quot; in the subject-matter of the programmes;but it is obvious that, within the confines of a single service, there cannot beas wide a representation of the tastes and interests of the audience as a whole,and those of the various groups within it, as there can be with two jointlyplanned services. This was true of BBC 1, which was a service that did nothave to earn its own living. The introduction of BBC 2 provided an oppor-tunity for a large widening of programme range in BBC television, and a comparable widening could be secured in Independent Television.14. Any single general television service must be restricted in the programmes which it can show at the times when most people can watch. Purely on atemporal basis, this must be so; for, except at weekends, the normal maximumviewing span of most working adults is limited to four or five hours from6-7 o&apos;clock to 10-11 o&apos;clock. In that time, in a single service, there is notscope to cover much more than the staple fare of television; light entertainmentshows, plays, series and serials, comedies, sport, news, current affairs, anddocumentaries. A single self-supporting service can be adventurous within limits, but not beyond.15. Independent Television is one of the most potent forms of communication and enjoys a huge daily audience. Just as we would deprecate a public librarysystem or an organisation of the cinema or the theatre which was unable toprovide a wide range of material for its users, so we can say that televisionis weakened if it cannot cater well for different needs; the operation of asecond ITV service would do much to solve this problem and would widenhorizons, provided it was operated so as to extend the range of existingtelevision programming.
IV. ITV 2 Complementary to and NotCompetitive with ITV 116. The 1964 Television Act, in Section 25, requires that where there is morethan one ITV service the Authority shall:ensure that, so far as possible, the same kind of subject matter is not broadcastat the same time in the different programmes.To some people, the provision of a complementary service is merely the avoidance of clashes as required by the Act. To the Authority, however,a truly complementary second service is one which, as well as being planned to provide alternative types of programme for the viewer at any given time,serves to complete and fill out the range of ITV programmes available. It isone which enables Independent Television to find the elbow-room referredto earlier.17. It is possible to conceive of a complementary ITV 2 service providedby a programme company, or group of programme companies, separate from those of ITV 1 and in competition with them for the viewing audience,and therefore for advertising revenue. But in functional terms such anarrangement could not work. For each service would have an interest inlooking to the size of its audience at any given time and would be competingnot only with the BBC but with the other ITV service. This would be boundto affect the programme content and scheduling of the two ITV services, andto diminish opportunities to screen programmes designed for, say, 10 per cent of the viewers. A better situation would be one where programmes could be planned and scheduled without regard to their relative audiences as betweenITV 1 and ITV 2. Thus, if there were a light entertainment programme onITV 1, it would be better scheduling, in the Authority&apos;s view, if the programmegoing out on ITV 2 were, for example, an arts or documentary programme, oran experimental programme, of a type likely to please those viewers whowould not be attracted by what was on ITV 1. This programming policypoints to a system where the two Independent channels are as little as possiblein rivalry with each other for the same part of the audience at the same time,although there would be competition on an equal footing with the BBC.If this complementarity between ITV 1 and ITV 2 is achieved, then a wider range of the total audience will be provided with programmes which are totheir taste. A self-supporting single service will always find it difficultregularly to screen programmes which it is known will attract a relatively small proportion of the total audience. With two services, the planners willbe able to accept the possibility of small audiences at peak time with equani-mity, since the audience for the alternative ITV programme need not be substantially affected. There is therefore, in a complementary situation, aninherent, rather than an imposed, reason for scheduling programmes in theway that serves the viewer best; and planners are not tempted to placeprogrammes of mass appeal against each other, since that would diminish the following of both.f/
V. The Programme Possibilities18. In programme terms there is a whole range of needs which cannotproperly be satisfied by Independent Television unless scope for expansioncan be provided by means of a second service planned in conjunction with thefirst. It is true that to a limited degree these needs, or some of them, canbe met within the confines of a single service, especially if it is allowed tobuild up its transmission hours free from the existing restrictions. Butviewers and programme makers would increasingly see the restrictions of asingle service as depriving them of great opportunities. The alternative an essential one, in the Authority&apos;s view is to extend ITVs public servicethrough a second channel which presents programmes coming from a widernumber of sources and catering for a greater variety of viewers&apos; interests.19. It is time to be more specific about some of the fields in which oppor-tunities would arise:(i) It would be possible to deal in greater depth and detail, and more frequently, with current affairs, with arts and sciences, with political,economic, and social issues.(ii) In an age of increased leisure, television can support a wide range ofleisure pursuits; some of these, like gardening and motoring, have very wide appeal, while many others command smaller followings butequal, or greater, devotion.(iii) To travel vicariously, to see what cannot be seen from the windowsof home, is a special enrichment that can be enjoyed through television.As more viewers have colour sets, the importance of this will grow;more programmes of this kind in peak time should foster its growth and widen understanding. The relevance of Europe and of Europeanprogrammes is obvious here.(iv) It is desirable to stimulate the production of programmes of an experi-mental nature. These are, by definition, impossible to specify in ad-vance. The need for freedom to experiment applies not only to pro-duction and writing techniques but also to assessing audience reaction to different types of programmes, whether they be designed to appeal tothe mass audience or to particular parts of it.(v) Extended coverage would be possible for a number of sporting events of all kinds. The interests of those who like sport often conflict, on asingle channel, with the needs of schools or housewives or children or general viewers. Moreover, sports which, though pleasing to watch,have only a limited following cannot easily be shown. Clearly loversof sport, and haters of sport, are much better served by two channels.(vi) It is an incentive towards excellence in educational and other seriousprogramme fields if better viewing times are available for some ofthis output. More viewers should have the chance to see such pro-grammes; more viewers (though possibly never a majority) will want tosee such programmes as levels of education rise. There are a number of educational needs (both curricular and informal, for adults and for children) to which television could make a unique contribution, and
which are not at present being catered for on any channel. We would wish to explore ways in which the additional capacity provided by an extra service could be used for these purposes.(vii) ITV lacks the equivalent of a newspapers correspondence column.It has too few opportunities of hearing from viewers, and of con-ducting some dialogue about television itself and about the job whichit is, or should be, doing. Without becoming narcissistic, we should hope that a second channel could enable us to deal more fully withtelevision itself.(viii) Much first-class television material goes to waste after a single showing.In a two-channel service there is scope for the planned repeating ofworthwhile programmes of all kinds between the two channels.(ix) Some of the programmes of the regional companies which are atpresent excluded from the network, because of too much programmepressure on too few outlets, should have wider distribution; creativestaff will then be less drawn to the central companies if regionalcompanies have opportunities for programme making that will effec-tively challenge their talents. Major centres of regular network pro-gramme production already exist in London, Birmingham, manchester and Leeds. There is the production capacity available to add Glasgow,Cardiff and Bristol, Newcastle, Southampton, Norwich and possiblyPlymouth to this list. The result would not only be a valuable stimulus to the system: it would also perform a social function, which ITV by itsown record has always supported, of countering tendencies that wouldfocus the nation&apos;s life too strongly on the metropolis.(x) With more elbow-room, ITV would be freer to explore what can be offered by independent programme makers; and to act as patronsto such independents, encouraging, purchasing or commissioningtheir work.(xi) In the particular case of Wales, the introduction of a second ITVservice could do much to relieve the tensions which arise at present in attempting to provide a general service and also to serve the special needs and interests of those living in Wales particularly those whowant to have programmes in the Welsh language at good viewing times.Even if the programming of ITV 2 were largely on a national basis,there would be the opportunity for regional opt-outs during whichprogrammes of special interest for Wales and in the Welsh languagecould be shown. It would also be possible for such programmes to be shown on ITV 1 in the knowledge that an alternative programme was available on ITV 2. All this is quite apart from the availability of the ITV 2 channel during the daytime and in the early eveningwhen it would generally not be transmitting ITV 2. For we are assuming that ITV 2, like BBC 2, would be mainly an evening and weekendservice.These and other opportunities could be met by a second ITV service which would complement and supplement the output of ITV 1, with numerouscommon junctions, so that a choice could be offered in accordance with section 25 of the Act.
20. Complementary planning of a two-channel ITV service is not justa question of calling a new channel into existence to redress the balance ofthe old. ITV 1, as it now exists, to a great extent already provides as balanceda service as can be expected from a single channel which is financed solelyfrom the sale of advertising time. Some 30 to 35 per cent overall of theaverage weekly output is classified as serious, and this figure excludes alldrama of whatever kind. In broad terms the essential elements of &apos;properbalance&apos; already provided in the single service are (a) adequate daily bulletinsof national news; (b) political programmes; (c) social programmes; (d) docu-mentary programmes; (e) cultural programmes (i.e. the arts, history, science);(f) religious programmes; and (g) educational programmes for schools andadult audiences. Programmes in most of these categories are already to befound in the evening hours.21. The Authority does not envisage the arrival of a second channel leading to any significant change in this balance on the first channel. Consequently,if ITV 2 is to be a genuine counterpart to ITV 1, with a view to both channelstogether catering for a wider spectrum of tastes and interests, then it would follow that a substantially higher proportion of its programmes than ofthose on ITV 1 would be classified as serious. More important, perhaps,it would be able to show a much higher proportion of its serious output in peak time. All this does not mean to say that 1TV 2 should predomin-predominantly contain programmes of minority appeal. It would be the Authority&apos;intention that both its services should have their own forms of balance and range. In the case of ITV 2, there would be advantage in a variety of pro-gramme elements so that the audience would be carried forward fromdiverting programmes to more demanding ones.VI. The Reactions of the ITV Companies22. With all these considerations in mind, the Authority came to the con-clusion that a complementary second ITV service would enlarge the range of Independent Television^ output, with benefit to the viewer and to creativepeople working for the system especially those whose talents could not find full expression within the confines of a single service which is unable tocater extensively for minority audiences in peak time. It remained to beseen whether what it wanted seemed feasible to those who were directly involved in the operation of the system.23. The companies, without exception, took the view that a second service,run on the lines so far described, was indeed possible and desirable. It wasplain that the establishment of such a service could not be a very rewardingprospect financially for the companies, and indeed, for the first few years at least, would be almost certain to reduce profitability. Simple arithmetic,or the most general look at BBC 1 and BBC 2, made it plain that the increasein production costs brought about by a two-channel operation could not be matched by a comparable increase in total ratings. Nevertheless, the com-
panies were in no doubt that proposals for ITV 2 should go forward andshould be supported in principle by them. In our view, there are four main reasons for their attitude:(i) The companies, like the Authority, are sensitive to the limitationswhich a single-channel service imposes on the range of programmes which can be offered to the viewer, particularly in peak time. They arealso even more aware than the Authority is of the amount of creativetalent and ability within the system which could be producing worth-while programmes (especially perhaps in the documentary and currentaffairs fields) if a two-channel system greatly increased (as it would)ITVs freedom to present such fare in the evenings.(ii) There is inevitably much spare studio capacity and surplus potential ina system which (with ITN) has 16 production companies. The sparecapacity has come into being over the years for a sound reason that ITVdepends on a federal and regional structure which is one of its strengths;nevertheless, it is frustrating both to those with production abilities andto those who care about managerial efficiency that this capacity cannotbe fully used by a single channel. NBP1 Report No. 156 discusses this problem and makes its plain that there are inevitably substantial reserveshere which the companies would want to use. A second service wouldprovide greater scope for those working in the system to produce pro-grammes knowing that they would receive a wide showing. The result would be the fuller use of the capacity of a diverse system, and the in-jection of further elements of diversity into it.(iii) The possession of two channels by the BBC has upset the competitivebalance between BBC and ITV in several ways, some obvious and some more subtle. For example, if ITV is providing an evening programme which is serious but not very popular, it can no longer expect to holdits audience on the basis that the opposition also will be a serious ratherthan a popular programme; for this will only be true of one of the twoBBC channels, while the other, following the principles of comple-mentary programming, will very often be popular and drawing offmany viewers. Although the overall position has not yet seriouslychanged, it is natural that the companies should fear that, without asecond ITV channel, a position might eventually be reached in which eachof the three channels took a third of the audience. This consideration would apply with even greater force if the fourth channel were to be allocated in such a way that the ITV companies faced three competitors,rather than two as now, for the audience. Serious difficulties would obviously arise if there were a downward drift of audiences, not only for the companies but also for the Authority which would find it harderto impose its present public service requirements on the companies insuch a situation.(iv) There are dangers to morale and to quality in a confined situation.All companies felt that the system must move forward and that, while1TV 2 might have disparate effects upon the prospects of individual companies, it was right that a new outlet and a new opportunity shouldbe provided.
VII. Alternative Possibilities24. There is then, within the ranks of those who work for independent television, broad agreement about what is wanted. But there have alsobeen three other propositions examined by the Authority. They are bestdiscussed here with the acknowledgement that two of them have been regarded favourably by the Authority in the past.(i)A  COMPETITIVE  SERVICE  FURNISHED   BY  DIFFERENTCONTRACTORS?It is now clear to us that this solution is not the right one. The reasons are not only that the range of the service is better enlarged by two comple-mentary channels, and the public and the viewer better served thereby, butalso that a double service on these lines would be so wasteful of resources,without greatly extending the present range of ITV programming, that itcould only produce one of two consequences: either two inferior services would be run on inadequate budgets, or so much advertising revenue wouldbe drawn into television advertising, if two decent services were to be sup-ported, that newspapers and other media which rely on advertising revenue would be damaged and perhaps put out of business. We understand the attraction, in principle, for some advertisers of a system which would give them two competitive television outlets in the same place at the same time.But, in practical terms, we think that a competitive system on these lines would be injurious to the viewer, to ITV, and before long to the advertisersthemselves. The fifteen different markets which ITV provides for advertisersrepresent the maximum competition which can exist without reducing pro-gramme standards and choices in a way that would be unacceptable tothe Government, the Authority, and the public. The ITV 2 possibilities for the advertisers are likely to lie elsewhere than through competition,notably in the increased scope available for reaching the smaller sections ofthe total audience who will be attracted to the particular programmes of(ii) A FOURTH GENERAL SERVICE INDEPENDENT OF BBC ANDITA?Many of the disadvantages of (i) apply to this idea also, with four furtheradverse factors to be taken into account. First, it would not be possible(unless some new superstructure were set up) even to secure the broadavoidance of programme clashes which the Authority would, under the Act,have to try to secure with competitive 1TV services; there would, therefore,be no means of seeing that the services fitted together. Secondly, if the systemwere not supported by advertising, it could presumably only be supportedby public money, which would raise various difficulties. Thirdly, therewould be all the expense of setting up an entirely new broadcasting system which had its own supervisory body and studio facilities, and which, for transmission facilities, would have to come to some arrangement with theAuthority and the BBC to use the common UHF sites. Fourthly, the new service would itself have all those constraints of a single-channel operation from which we now think it is in the public interest that we should be free.ITV 2.
(iii)     A  SPECIALIZED   FOURTH   CHANNEL,  PERHAPS   for education?It is suggested by some that the allocation of the fourth and last of the UHFchannels at present available should be for a serious purpose, that is, for increasing the amount of education and information available to the viewer,or alternatively for increasing the amount of experimental and unusualviewing, rather than for increasing the amount of entertainment. While wesympathize with the ideas underlying this proposal, we do not believe thatthe best way of achieving what is sought is by turning over one channelexclusively to this purpose. Already the three existing channels containeducation, adult education, information, and so on, intermingled withprogrammes which have as their object the attraction of viewers. It seemsto us that, if the fourth channel is to perform a real educational service and not only for those who already feel that they want more education-it must not be a channel reserved for avowedly educational programmes;it must rather at times woo the viewer as well as lead him on to new ex-periences and new insights. The existence of a second ITV channel would,as we have indicated above, give good educational opportunities and would put more serious programming into peak hours. But we do not feel thatmaking ITV 2 educational throughout the day would be the best way ofperforming the very important educational function (particularly for thosewho left school at 15) which we would want to see an ITV 2 performing.Our belief, therefore, is that those who ask for the fourth channel to serve a wholly educational purpose are both underestimating the degree to which,under our proposals, ITV 2 would differ, in its proportion of serious content,from ITV 1 and also overestimating the educational power of a channelwhich is solely and directly devoted to education. Moreover, on BBC 2now (and perhaps ITV 2 in the future) there is no lack of channel space in the daytime hours, when programmes which are directly educationalare most likely to meet untired minds. Our hope, therefore, is that ITV 2 would indeed perform, with ITV 1, a most vital service of educating and informing the mass of viewers but without deterring them by carrying a special labelwhich could diminish its effectiveness.VIIL Possible Arrangements for ITV 225. The need then is, in our view, for a complementary and viable ITV 2,which would greatly extend the range of programmes available to the viewerand which would also use resources already within Independent Television,for the most part, by involving in some way the existing producers of ITVprogrammes. The effect of this would be to provide for this country a four-service system in which two complementary ITV services competed with twocomplementary BBC television services. This seems to the Authority to bea desirable mid-way position between the usual European practice (wherethe lack of competition in some countries diminishes the thrust and effective-ness of the television service available) and the US practice (where excessive
competition tends to squeeze out many of the desirable programmes whichin a complementary situation can be shown).26. An important feature of any arrangements proposed for ITV 2 is thatthey should meet two needs which are, to some extent, at odds with eachother:(i) Valuable to any television service is the momentum which is generatedby large production teams, planning ahead, using their resources of plant and existing skill, and devoting proved expertise to fresh ideas.The success of Independent Television has owed much to its use of thefive central companies in such a way that they could plan ahead and bring major resources to bear on creative ideas, with the knowledge that the resulting programmes would be assured of a showing throughoutthe network. This means that much of the time on ITV 1 is shared out and scheduled by these five major suppliers in a way that facilitatesplanning and production. As a result, more of the programmes shown on Independent Television are successful, in the various senses of thatword, than they would be if a central exhibitor simply shopped aroundfor programmes already made and if none of the providers could be certain that what he was spending time and talent and money on couldbe assured of a nationwide showing. The results of this general impetusto good programme making should be seen in ITV 2 as well as in ITV 1,if the second service is not to be a rag-bag; a large number of the pro-gramme makers who could provide good material to fill a secondchannel worthily are already working for these five central companies.(ii) It is also essential that wider facilities should be available for access to a network showing by other programme makers. Programmes of quality which come from regional companies or from freelance producersshould have a fair chance of being selected for a national showing. Theknowledge that this possibility is available, and more widely availablethan it can be when a single channel is supplied by so many programmemakers, would be of the greatest benefit to the morale of producers indifferent areas of production; and this increase of access, provided thatthe new material was of good calibre, seems to us one of the mostpotent reasons for having an ITV 2. It would be useful also to see howvalid is the proposal that there should be freer access to the mediumby particular sections of the community who feel that they have some special message or viewpoint. There are dangers of amateurishness in production and difficulties in incorporating such programmes in anational television service without sacrificing impartiality and editorialcontrol. Nevertheless, it would certainly be more possible to considercontributions of this kind in a two-channel ITV situation than it is atpresent.27. With these conflicting needs in mind, we have given careful thought to possible forms of organization which would best meet the requirements ofITV 2. Of these, the three which seemed to us the strongest possibilitieswere:(i) ITV 2 could be run by the existing companies in their own areas withoutthe creation of any new legally constituted consortium. Under thisarrangement, each company would sell advertising time in its area/
over two services and, just as it now provides ITV 1 programmes froma mixture of its own production, acquisition from other programme companies, and purchases of film and other recorded material from outside producers, so it would supply a second service from similarsources.(ii) ITV 2 could be supplied by a company (say, &quot;ITV 2 Limited&quot;) formedon ITN lines and owned by all the companies. Within this arrangementit would be possible to have the various subsidiary options: -(a) &quot;ITV 2 Limited&quot; could be owned by all the existing companies in the same proportions as their interest in ITV 1(as measured by advertising revenue after Levy);(b) it could be owned by them in differing proportions (say,smaller companies having a larger interest than now);(c) there could be participation in the ownership of &quot;ITV 2Limited&quot; from outside the system and, as some wouldhave it, by the ITA itself;(d) &quot;ITV 2 Limited&quot; could itself sell the advertising in ITV 2;(e) &quot;ITV 2 Limited&quot; could sell no advertising; this would bedone by the programme companies in their own areas and they would then pay from their total ITV 1 and ITV 2advertising revenue an annual subscription to &quot;ITV 2Limited&quot; sufficient to meet its programme budget andoverheads.(iii) The existing companies could sell the advertising revenue of ITV in their own areas. The ITA could then, in conjunction with the pro-gramme companies, &quot;run&quot; 1TV 2 in the sense that: -(a) the ITA would decide what kind of programmes should be broadcast at given times in ITV 2 and would then arrangefor their purchase (if they were already on offer) or corn-mission them, in both cases using the services of theprogramme companies (network and regional) and of outside producing agencies; and(b) the ITA would determine, through its existing powers inSection 15 of the Television Act, the financial terms underwhich the various programme companies purchased either from other companies in the system or from outsidesuppliers the programmes decided upon by the Authority.There are variants and blends of the above ideas, and subsidiary questionsof detail (such as presentation), which could be discussed: but broadly these were the three basic systems which emerged when we thought the matterthrough and when we consulted those who were involved in ITV.28. Each of the possible arrangements has its attractions and drawbacks.The need for joint planning of the two services (and for a shared interestin their joint success) led us eventually to decide against recommending(ii). Its attractions were mainly the seeming novelty of a fresh programmeplanning body (which yet could not be genuinely independent without
spoiling complementary planning, as the experience of BBC 1 and 2 hasshown), and the protection that might be offered to smaller companies ifrevenue were being diverted to the larger areas. (It seemed that there were better ways of securing this protection, through the Authority&apos;s controlof rentals and programme prices, while in a dual-service situation the regionalcompanies&apos; status in the system could be upgraded through the increasednational showing of their programmes which would be possible.)29. Our recommendation is that a blend of (i) and (iii) in paragraph 27above would provide the best solution. The Authority, in addition to thegeneral oversight of the schedules which it now exercises over ITV 1, would participate on a continuous basis in the programme scheduling of the twochannels in future, being itself a selector, though not a maker, of programmes for some portion of the time; the existing programme controllers, togetherwith some controllers from the regional companies, would share in the prepar-ation of schedules and bring to this task their close awareness of companies&apos;resources and programme ideas. In order to share the scheduling functionfully and effectively with the companies, the Authority would have on its staff two programme planners with similar expertise to that of the programmecontrollers of the companies; and these programme planners would have thekind of awareness of production plans and possibilities across the full range of companies that the company programme controller, in moreintense form, has of the possibilities within his own company. We now proceed to give more detail of the new arrangements on the Authority&apos;aside which we would envisage in a situation where ITV had two channels.IX. A New Programme Planning board for the Network30. The first change would be an organizational one. The Authority has so far adopted the view that the requirements of Section 5 of the TelevisionAct call for it to be represented at the later and more general stages of thecompanies&apos; scheduling meetings. Regular meetings also take place of theProgramme Policy Committee, under the chairmanship of the authority and with the companies&apos; chief executives and programme controllers present,at which important matters of broad programme policy are discussed.The Authority has not, however, attempted to control in the earliest stagesthe programme planning of the system.31. In a two-channel situation (and not least with the requirements of Section25 of the Act in mind), the Authority considers that a Programme PlanningBoard should be responsible for all aspects of ITV network planning andscheduling. Such a Board might comprise three members of the ITA staff(one as the Chairman of the Board, and the two ITA programme planners),five controllers from the central companies, and three controllers from the regional companies. The secretary of the Board would be a member of theITA staff and the Board would be serviced by the ITA in conjunction withthe existing ITCA Network Programme Secretariat. Local programmingwould continue to be the responsibility of each company individually.
32. The function of the Board would be to oversee all programme planning and scheduling for the ITV network. It might well not itself undertakeall the detailed planning for incorporating the output of up to sixteen com-panies into two services; but, in formal terms, those involved in such planningwould be doing so as agents of the Planning Board, to whom they would report. The arrangement proposed would broaden the present structure of the company programme controllers&apos; committee and would leave thecompanies&apos; creative momentum as the primary source of specific pro-gramme ideas; but it would also provide a strong ITA presence at the centre of the system and enable the ITA to survey, at an early stage, the full range of what was available, or potentially available. Thus the Authority&apos;s in-volvement in the organization of ITVs network output would not only take the form of mandating programmes and receiving schedules for con-sideration, as now, but would also include discussion of scheduling at an earlier stage: the full Authority&apos;s means of exercising this oversight would beunchanged, since its senior staff would continue to be answerable for whatwas planned to it and to the committee (the Programme Schedule Committee)which gives special consideration to this part of the Authority&apos;s work.X. Freer Access to the National Audience33. The second change would relate to the basis of ITV scheduling. Atpresent, partly for the reasons given in (i) of paragraph 26 above and partly because of the constraints imposed by the limited opportunities of a singleservice, the amount of programme production which each company canundertake for national showing is broadly speaking laid down in advance.If a company wants to increase its network output it is difficult for it to do so,however good the programmes in question are, except at the expense of,and by agreement with, other programme companies.34. These somewhat rigid arrangements have their advantages in terms ofrational planning and equitable use of the physical and creative resourcesof the various companies. They do, however, inevitably limit the corn-petition to supply programmes and the possibility of arranging networkingfor programmes of merit that are not pre-ordained to be on the network.They also engender frustrations among creative people in the companies.35. If ITV 2 were authorized, the system would be able to break out of theserigidities. The extra home-produced programmes required would be suppliedboth by guaranteed access and by commissioning and choice outside anyquota system in the following way. There would be, to fill the newly availabletime, two blocks of planned and guaranteed access to the network, one forthe central and one for the regional companies. There would be a thirdblock, not allocated in advance, which would be filled by the ProgrammeBoard from equal competition. The Board would consider what the com-panies and outside producers had (or could have) to offer, how it fitted intothe programme needs of two complementary services, and, in particular,any requirements for neglected areas of programming.
36. It is tempting to say at this stage what the size of each &quot;block&quot; shouldbe and perhaps that each should consist of the same number of hours. Itwould also be tidy to announce a fixed quota within the third block re-served for independent outside producers. But the Authority would need to make a closer study both of what the companies themselves could do in a situation that is at least two years away and of the amount of first-classprogramming by independent producers, not now used, which might beavailable in such a situation (to be supplied probably through the programme companies on terms settled by the Programme Planning Board) before itestablished firm proportions. The general thought is that effective schedulingfor two complementary channels demands unity of control but variety of interest and method; that an arrangement such as we describe could bestmeet both of the needs described in paragraph 26 above; that up to one-thirdof the total networked output of the two channels should come forward in anew way, by regional allocations and by choices made by the ProgrammePlanning Board; and that the possibility of considering programmes on their merits and scheduling to meet particular needs would be greatly increased if a two-channel operation was organized in this way.XI. Financial Prospects of ITV 237. Given the assumption of a complementary service of ITV 2, it is not expected that its introduction will lead to any dramatic increase in adver-advertising revenue above that earned by a single service.38. Advertisers will expect to pay for the audience delivered to them by thetwo services. It is, therefore, necessary to make some assumptions abouthow the total audience will divide between ITV 1 and 2 and BBC 1 and BBC 2.It must be remembered that BBC 2 has been broadcasting for more than seven years and that it will have a lead of nearer ten years, or more, by thetime the first ITV 2 transmissions begin. It is likely, therefore, that ITV 2will start with a smaller audience than BBC 2. It has been suggested thatsome more than proportionate increase in revenue might result from twospecial factors: that some smaller advertisers who find the present cost of atelevision campaign too high may be more ready to advertise on ITV 2,and that certain specialised advertisers may be attracted to the particularaudiences of ITV 2.39. The 1TV 2 Working Party asked the British Bureau of Television Ad-vertising to make the best estimates that it could of the likely revenue of asecond ITV service. In summary, the estimate of the net revenue additionresulting from a second service (allowing for loss of revenue in ITV 1 as aresult of diversion of audience from the first to the second service) showed,after two years of transmitter development giving a total population coverageof about 80 per cent for ITV 2, a possible figure of around  14m., no allow-ance being made in that figure for inflation or for any Levy deduction.40. There are various ways in which advertising might be sold in a secondITV service. One possibility is that it should be sold and inserted into the
programme on a centralized and national basis; another that it should be sold &quot;across the board&quot; with that of ITV 1, i.e. that an advertiser would pay for simultaneous insertions in both ITV 1 and ITV 2 programmes; a thirdis that it should be sold by existing companies, but as an entirely separatecommodity from ITV 1 advertising. This is a question on which no con-clusions need yet be reached. Indeed it is better, rather than attemptingnow to forecast the best arrangement, to leave it for resolution in the lightof the circumstances prevailing when ITV 2 begins.41. The ITV 2 Working Party also asked a small group of specialists fromthe companies to prepare an estimate of the extra cost of an ITV 2 usingexisting facilities. The advice given was that the additional direct cost of aspecimen programme schedule, based on the concept of a complementaryservice and limited in the first place to about thirty-five hours a week, would bearound  1 lm., and the indirect cost about  4m. In addition the companiescollectively would probably need to spend between  2m. and  2^m. on capital account on the provision of additional master control and other facilities.42. These figures exclude the costs of the Authority, where capital expen-diture on the construction programme envisaged for the first five years would be of the order of  7m. The additional rental needed in order that,after tax, the Authority can cover this expenditure and the operating costs of the additional transmitter and link network is likely to be of the orderof  5m. a year for the initial period. A proportion of the capital costs would have to be incurred before the service became operational. The methodof financing this would depend very much on the point in time at which theservice was authorized, but the money would be found either from theAuthority&apos;s accumulated reserves or by borrowing, as appropriate. It isnot the Authority&apos;s intention that the development of ITV 2 should pre-judice the planned UHF extension of ITV 1.43. The exact interrelation between these two sets of figures of revenue and total ITA and company expenditure will depend upon what is done about the Levy. If the Levy remains, as now, a charge upon advertisingrevenue, then difficulties will arise for, assuming that the revenue of bothITV 1 and ITV 2 accrues in any area to the same programme company,it will be treated as a single unit for Levy purposes. Over much of the system,this would mean that the additional income earned by ITV 2 would be subjectto the higher rates of Levy. Discussions are, however, proceeding with government about the basis of charging the Levy. If this were alteredso as to be related to profits or to revenue after specified heads of pro-gramme spending had been deducted, then it would be one which was better adapted to a two-service situation. It will be seen that, with the Levycurrently running at an annual rate of  12 m., and with the possibility of an eventual net increase of revenue of  14m. or so, there is reason to suppose that ITV could support a second service even if the estimate of cost givenin the preceding paragraphs proves, in the event, to have been too con-servative.44. It is not a precondition for ITV 2 that it should necessarily be self-supporting from its own income. Just as the total income of ITV 1 is atpresent available for financing programmes as a whole, and the advertisingassociated with a particular item does not have to be sufficient to pay for the
item&apos;s production, so, in a dual-service situation, there could be, if necessary,a transfer of revenue from the more profitable ITV 1 to ITV 2. The use of asingle pool of revenue to finance more than one service is the position in the bbc where there is no predetermined allocation of the global licence feeto the various services: it would not be possible if ITV 2 were run com-petitively with ITV 1 by different contractors, nor would it be possible if thefourth channel were given to an entirely new body.45. If ITV 2 were authorized, there would undoubtedly be a complexfinancial situation at the beginning. The full audience potential would not berealized immediately, nor is it certain that a second service could be openedon a nation-wide basis from the start. The smaller regional companies haveexpressed fears about the effect on their revenue if ITV 2 starts in the largerareas in advance of its start in the remoter parts of the country. The largercompanies have also suggested that, if this is to be the initial position, they also will suffer in the early years since the financial burden of the additional production will fall upon them and not be immediately shared by other ITV 2companies. In the early years it may be necessary for the Levy in whole orin part to be returned to the system, with benefit to the larger companies,unless the Levy burden is alleviated in a dual-service system as a resultof the introduction of a different basis of charging. If the larger companies are benefited in such a way, it would be more possible for them to bear theadditional costs, and, if the fears of the regional companies about a diversion of revenue to the centre were realized, to pay such additional rental to theAuthority as would be necessary if the Authority found it desirable further to reduce its rental demands upon the smaller companies. An equitablesharing of profitability across the system as a whole could also be secured by appropriate changes in the financial arrangements for the supply of pro-grammes between companies.46. There are some in the ITV system who assert that it would be desirablewith the arrival of ITV 2 to create larger units. The argument is that thiswould give all companies a worthwhile possibility of providing programmes to the network, whereas, if contract areas remain as now, the smaller com-panies will be able to make only minor contributions, if any. Existingstudio centres would not be closed when the larger units were created butthe smaller ones would concentrate on purely local production as part ofthe larger unit. The Authority would hope that, if ITV 2 were introduced before 1976, some useful lessons could be learnt before the award of contracts for the period after 1976, when all the relevant considerations and not onlythe ITV 2 position could be taken into account in deciding whether anychange in the contractual shape of the system was desirable.Xn. The Timing of ITV 247. If an early start for ITV 2 were authorised without delay, it would bepossible for first transmissions to start in 1974. This, together with an earlyderestriction of television broadcasting hours, would enable the Authority
to extend its service to the public. By 1974, Independent Television will be nearly twenty years old, having broadcast, with limited hours, only one service during the whole of that period. During the same period there havebeen a number of Government indications that the Authority would in due course be authorised to open a second channel in order that it might, to quote the December 1962 White Paper, be given full scope to offer moreselection to viewers and to experiment. The Authority itself has consistentlyfelt that this further outlet for Independent Television should be given.There is thus nothing new in the idea of ITV 2. The start of ITV 2 trans-missions in 1974 would take its place in an orderly progression in the tele-vision services available in this country: 1946, the restart of BBC 1 after theWar; 1955, the start of ITV transmissions; 1964, the start of BBC 2; and1974 the start of ITV 2. During the recent Consultation, reference was madeby a number of people from the creative side to the need for television totake a further stride forward if the danger of stagnation and frustration isto be avoided.48. The Authority understands the attitude of those who say that a decision about the allocation of the fourth (and, for the time being, only remaining)channel should be delayed until it can take its place with any other changesin the pattern of broadcasting in the United Kingdom for the post-1976period. 1976 is, however, five years away, and if a decision about a furthertelevision service is to become effective only after that date, then the public and those people who work in broadcasting and who have been hopingfor further opportunities to deploy their creativity and their talent mustwait quite a long while. Moreover, though audiences for 1TV 2 should become established more quickly than BBC 2 (as more sets are UHF),station building would be a gradual process; thus, if ITV 2 were authorised in 1972 and began in 1974, it would still not cover a majority of regionsbefore 1976.49. Even if there are reservations on the part of Government about an actual start before 1976, there are important reasons why the authority should receive a decision in good time. Assuming that ITVs present broadtwo-tier structure, with programme providers in contractual relationship with a public authority, continues, the ITA and the companies would need toknow well before 1976 if there was to be a second service after that date and preferably to see its operations beginning in practice. This would enablethe ITA to provide the necessary transmitters for the service to operatefully from 1976, simultaneously with the start of new contract arrangements.The Authority would also be able to plan the future shape of the system,and negotiate contracts on a clear basis. The expiry of the present statutoryterm of the system in 1976 is sufficient of itself to run counter to the main-tenance of that sense of stability which the National Board for Prices and incomes last year called ITVs greatest requirement. It would be even more damaging if the Authority had to grant interim contracts for a short period after 1976 pending the completion of arrangements for the full introductionof a second ITV service.50. But the main reason for asking that an early decision be taken, preferablythat ITV 2 may begin in 1974, is simply that we believe this step to be theright one for reasons which we have given fully in this submission. If the
service needs this development, for the viewer&apos;s sake and for its own, and ifthe next two or three years offer a good time for bringing it to birth, then wewould regret seeing this, or any other broadcasting development, postponed for extraneous reasons. To freeze arrangements for some years does not seemto us to make for better scrutiny or for better arrangements.Most of those who have made their views known to the Authority, in theworking party or in the consultation, in discussion or through the Press,will find some of what they said reflected, or at least considered, in partsof this submission. But it is not to be expected that any of them will endorseall of what we have written. The Authority has tried to weigh and to balancedifferent ideas, and to come forward with the proposal which it believesthe best one in the public interest. Its view, in summary, is as follows:(i) there is a strong case for a second ITV service;(ii) it should be complementary to and not competitive with ITV 1;(iii) its introduction should provide greater opportunities for producingcompanies both within and outside Independent Television, and inparticular for the regional programme companies;(iv) its introduction would call for greater involvement by the authority in programme planning;(v) there are substantial arguments for an early decision being taken.ConclusionINDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITYGreenaways London/
