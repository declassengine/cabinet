IlIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 8 COPY NO     9 Qh) 018 January 1972CABINETEUROPEAN COMMUNITIES bill memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster. The attached draft of the European Communities Bill has beenprepared under the direction of the Solicitor-General in accordance withthe principles approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 23 November(CM(71) 58th Conclusions, Minute 4).    The Bill steers a middle course   -between a very short enabling measure on the lines advocated bySir John Foster MP and a long Bill embodying every detailed provision which might be thought desirable.    The attached draft takes account ofthe points made by the Legislation Committee, who invited me to submitit to the Cabinet for approval.2. The main features of the Bill are:a. Clause 2(1) gives the force of law to present and futureCommunity law which has direct internal effect &quot;without furtherenactment1&apos;, and Community law will be superior to other law inthis country,b. Clause 2(2) provides a wide general power to implement bysubordinate legislation directives and other Community provisions which do not have direct internal effect.c. Part II and Schedules 3 and 4 make detailed changes in ourlaw on account of existing Community provisions.The Annex describes the structure and contents of the Bill more fully.3.        Provisions have been excluded from the Bill where a change in thelaw is not essential.    For example, changes in coal and steel legislationhave been confined to a handful of repeals in Part IV of Schedule 3.    It wasearlier envisaged that the Bill would have standard provisions about offencesand powers of entry, but these turned out to be long and unattractive.    Inaddition the fields in which they might immediately be necessary have been less obtrusively covered by extension of existing powers by means of schedule 4.    They have accordingly been omitted.    On other matters,1
notably road transport, comprehensive legislation has been left until later,as the immediate impact of the Community system is slight.    Some subjectshave been left to subordinate legislation under clause 2(2).    A provision has been included only where it is needed on accession or shortly afterwards,and is important or sensitive or calls for amendment of an existing Act.4. The Bill might be slimmed still further by dropping provisionsincluded mainly because existing statutory provisions have to be amended-,and by leaving these to be dealt with by subordinate legislation under thegeneral power in clause 2(2),    This power will probably be used in future to make non-controversial amendments to statutes, if only to avoid a largenumber of Community Bills each year.    Clause 2(4) has been included topermit the power to be used for this purpose,    If this approach were adopted on the present exercise, we might perhaps drop such provisions asclause 8 (films), clause 10 (restrictive trade practices) and headings B-Iof Schedule 4 (food, horticultural grading, seeds, animal and plant health,and most of the road transport provisions),5. But I consider that this course would be unwise, for three main reasons:a. The attached Bill deals with all matters which have to bedealt with now and would normally require legislation to amendexisting Acts.    If the Bill departed from this principle, a provision would be included or excluded by reference only to its importance andsensitivity.    Distinctions based on subjective tests of this kind arenot easy to defend.    As the omissions came to light, suspicion would increase that the Bill was artificially small and that something wasbeing concealed on the omitted topics^b. We already have major constitutional innovations insubsections (1) and (2) of clause 2 (paragraph 2 a. and b. above).The ordinariness of the rest of the Bill demonstrates that we have adopted a normal legislative approach where possible.c. The omission of whole topics from the Bill would not avoidnew clauses and other amendments being put down to deal with them,and the mass of existing Community secondary legislation would be a ready source of miscellaneous amendments.    Dealing with these,without any indication in the Bill of how, the Community requirements would be implemented, might take nearly as long as dealing with amendments stimulated by the present Bill.    Although our obligations under the Treaty will limit the extent to which amendments to theprovisions of the Bill could be accepted.    Such a limitation is a feature of all legislation giving effect to Treaties, and in fact there is oftenroom for legitimate debate about how the obligation should be implemented.
6. I invite the Cabinet to approve the attached draft Bill for introduction in the House of Commons,G cabinet Office17 January 19723
ANNEXSTRUCTURE AND CONTENTS OP THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BILLPART I:   GENERAL provisions.     Part I includes the basic constitutional provisions.2*     Clause 1 defines the Treaties for &quot;the purpose of the Bill.   the definition includes about 150 existing1 treaties and other agreements whichare ancillary to the principal Treaties.   The titles of these treaties willbe listed in an Appendix to the volume containing the Treaty of Accessionfand every effort is being made to publish English texts before Second Reading.Future ancillary treaties will come within the definition, but only - incases where the United Kingdom is a party - after affirmative resolutionshave been obtained.3.     Clause 2(1) gives the force of law in this country to all the treaty provisions and Community instruments (present and future) which are intendedto have direct internal effect in Member States.   By virtue of this sub-section a wide range of Community law (including nearly all the instrumentsabout the common agricultural policy) will automatically have effect in thiscountry.   The European Court of Justice will have the last word on the inter-pretation of this law, and the Court has held that Community law hassupremacy over other lax^.   Clause 3(1) makes it clear that the principle ofsupremacy will apply and Clause 2(4) establishes, so far as possible, that present and future Acts of Parliament will be subject to this rule.4.     Clause 2(2) contains a general power to make subordinate legislation onany matter for the purpose of implementing a Community obligation or exer-cising a right under the Treaties;   subject to Schedule 2, such subordinate legislation may do anything which might be done by Act of Parliament(Clause 2(4)).   Clause 2(2) will enable us to meet not only the identifiedneed for a wide range of subordinate legislation to cover existing Communityobligations but also future needs, which are likely to increase in number and range over areas which cannot be foreseen with any precision.   As aresult of Clause 2(4) the power will be able to be used to make the amendments in statutory provisions which Community requirements will inevitably call forand which it would be impracticable to make each time by Bill,   The provisionsof Clause 2 will also serve as an indication to the Communities that we cancomply with any future obligations under the Treaties,1
5.     Schedule 2 prohibits the use of Clause 2(2) to impose or increasetaxation, to legislate retrospectively, to subdelegate or to create an offence carrying more than two years imprisonment.   An instrument under clause 2(2) will either be laid in draft and require an affirmative resolution or be made subject to the negative procedure.   In view of the wide range of matters which will or could be dealt with under Clause 2(2)it is difficult to lay down clear categories for either the negative or the affirmative procedure.   The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedurehave made proposals (CP(72) 5) about further examination of this aspect.6.     Clause 2(3) provides for payments to the Communities and Member states under Treaty obligations to be met by a direct charge on the consolidate fund (or where appropriate the National Loans Fund);   these payments includethe &quot;ressources proprcs&quot; in the form of customs duties and levy receipts, and eventually a proportion of VAT receipts, as well as the &quot;Member Statecontributions&quot; to the Community budget and contributions to the funds of theEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Investment Bank.The subsection provides for other expenditure incurred under the Treaties orthe Bill to be met out of Votes in the usual way.7.     Clause 3 deals with the treatment and proof of the Treaties and community instruments in legal proceedings in the United Kingdom.PART IIs   AMENDMENT OF LAW8&quot;     Part^11^ with Schedules 3 and 4, contains the detailed legislationneeded on accession or shortly afterwards to implement existing Communityobligationso   Nearly all the provisions could be made by subordinate legislation under Clause 2(2), but instead Part II represents the Governmenfsjudgment of which provisions ought to be put before Parliament in substantivelegislation.   The criteria employed are discussed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of thecovering memorandum.9.     An important provision in Part II which could not be made under clause 2(2) as the Bill stands is the provision in Clause 5 for the chargingof Community customs duty.   As it seems that it would never be appropriate touse Clause 2(2) to make any provision imposing or increasing taxation,Schedule 2 expressly prohibits its use for this purpose.   In this importantrespect, therefore, Part I could not be regarded as a self-contained Billsufficient in itself to enable our Treaty obligations to be implemented.2
 LS&amp;iULA contains general provisions about repeals and amendments, and about Northern.....Ireland^   The general provisions of the Bill will extend to northern Ireland, and so will all those detailed amendments of the law inPart II which, under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, are reserved to westminster:   eg customs duties.   For other provisions of the Bill (eg oncompany law) corresponding Northern Ireland legislation would normally berequired.   Clause 4(3) gives power for this to be done by a Northern IrelandOrder in Council, if the Northern Ireland Government were not to choose toproceed by way of substantive legislations   However, in the last resort if for any reason the Northern Ireland Government were not to take the necessary action, the general poxver in Clause 2(2) to make subordinate legislation isa reserve power for Westminster to do all that is necessary for NorthernIreland,11.     Clause    makes the provisions needed for the United Kingdom to dischargeits obligations as a member of the customs union on x^hich the Communities arefounded.Clause 6 will enable the common agricultural policy to be implemented.It sets up the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce to carry out certain of the intervention requirements of the policy.   The Board will bein charge of a new Government Department but responsible to the agriculture ministers and subject to their direction and control.Si2SSS-J. makes new arrangements for the financing of the Sugar Board.14o     Clause 8 alloxtfs the films of other Member States to count for thepurposes of the screen quota system, under which exhibitors are requiredto show a percentage of British films.^5*    Jik222  L2 brings company law into line with the Community directiveabout limited companies, and applies to both limited and unlimitedcompanies.   The general effect is to protect persons dealing with companieswho may be ignorant about their affairs.16.     Clause 10 ensures that our domestic control of restrictive trade practices operates in a way which is compatible with the Community system,3
17o     Clause      makes it a criminal offence punishable as perjury to givefalse evidence on oath before the European Court of Justice and bringswithin offences under the Official Secrets Act the unauthorised communi-cation of the classified information of a Member State   which has beenobtained in a EURATOM connection.18.     Clause 12 will permit statistical information about individualundertakings to be disclosed to a. Community institution in pursuance of a community obligation.^9*     Schedule 4, Heading A makes detailed amendments of the la.w about customs duties, import duty reliefs and the a,dmini strati on and collectionof the duties.20*     Schedule.,4,.,,,Heading B^I make detailed amendments in the existingstatutes regulating the composition and labelling of food, the grading andlabelling of horticultural produce, the production and marketing of seeds,fertilisers and feeding stuffs, the import and export of livestock, thecontrol of plant pests and diseases, the age and working hours of road transport drivers on international journeys and the licensing of publicservice vehicles.   In many cases the Schedule amends existing statutory powers of subordinate legislation and other provisions and thus attractsto the Community requirement the existing apparatus of administrative and enforcement machinery.FINANCIAL AND MANPOWER EFFECTS21.     The arrangements negotiated for one United Kingdom*s contribution tothe Budget were described in &quot;The United Kingdom and tne european communities&quot; (Cmnd 4715)? paragraphs 92-95.   These arrangements will be setout in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill, which repeatsthe following amounts:a.     the estimate that the United Kingdoms net contribution to theCommunity budget, taking into account estimates of possible receipts,might rise from about  100 million in 1973 to about  200 million inb. an estimated  55 million payable to the European Investment Bankover a period of 2-g- years from accession;197754
c. an investment of  24 million in the reserve funds of the EGSC,payable in three annual instalments from accession;d. a maximum lending obligation of  250 million to Member States in balance of payments difficulties.The Memorandum indicates that it is not possible to quantify the effect ofthe Bill on other public expenditure and receipts, but mentions the followingspecific amounts;e. an estimated liability of about  1.5 million annually for financing the Sugar Board;f. an estimated net cost of  2.2 million annually on account of theadditional social security benefits and medical charges which willbecome payable in connection with the movement of persons within theCommunityfgo     an estimated once-for-all deferment of  20 million revenue fromcustoms duties in 1973. as a result of new procedures for deferringpayment on the acceptance of security;h.     an estimated  3 million to  4 million annually in staff andadministrative costs.22.     h. above is based on an estimate, . which the Memorandum will also give, that over the whole Civil Service there will be an additional require-ment of the order of 500 staff in the period before entry, plus a further,000 spread over several years thereafter.5
