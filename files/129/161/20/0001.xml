THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government cp(72) 20 COPY NO        D^14 February 1972CABINETTHE FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF the magistrates&apos; COURTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department. The Lord Chancellor has set out in his memorandum (CP(72) 19)his reasons for proposing central government control of the administra-tion of magistrates  courts. My reasons for disagreeing with his views are set out below.2. The Annex to this memorandum contains a brief account of theexisting system, which has been agreed with the Lord Chancellor.3. The present system works reasonably well;  there is no problemcomparable with that tackled by Beeching in dealing with the highercourts.   Congestion of business and arrears of work present problems in London and some other areas, but these are not widespread.Standards are uneven, as in all local authority services; but some of theLord Chancellor&apos;s arguments for centralisation could be used to justifycentralisation of other local services, such as the police.    Provisionsalready in the Local Government Bill will go a long way towardsremedying current deficiencies by rationalising the system of magistrates&apos; courts committees and the local government areas on whichthey depend.    Financial relations with the local authorities will also be improved and simplified by provisions in clause 44 of the criminla justice Bill.4. On the other hand, the benefits which would be brought bycentralisation are not clear, and some of its advocates, particularly among magistrates and justices&apos; clerks, appear to misapprehend whatthese would be.    For example, the magistrates hope still to appointjustices&apos; clerks, which would be inconsistent with the object of givingthe clerks a Civil Service career structure, and they tend to blame thelocal authorities for deficiencies in court buildings which are largely dueto capital investment restrictions under central government policies.The justices1 clerks have salary aspirations which (to judge from theexperience of their colleagues from the higher courts who have recentlybecome civil servants under the Courts Act) might be rudely shattered.1
5. In. my view, it is questionable whether any real advantages inregard to court buildings would result from centralisation.    In so far as existing buildings are unsatisfactory, this is mainly because the volumeof work has increased and central government restrictions on capital investment have held back local authority investment; but even so,capital expenditure on magistrates  courts has risen from under ^million in 1960-61 to  5 million in 1971-72 and will be about 10 million in 1974-75.    Common standards of new building formagistrates1 courts are achieved by use of the grant approval machinery(which did not apply to buildings for the higher courts), and I do notthink that civic pride has resulted in excessively high standards being adopted.    It is suggested that centralisation would enable some duplication-tion to be avoided in future, but so will local government reorganisation.Some loss of facilities, and consequent increase in expenditure, wouldprobably also result from reluctance by local authorities to agree asreadily as in the past to magiofcraiS07 courts sitting occasionally inmunicipal buildings.6. The centralised system of higher courts came into operation onlyon 1 January this year, and is as yet untested.   On any basis, it -semstoo soon, when this system has y&amp;t to work through its teething troubles,to contemplate central government assuming the additional responsibilityfor the magistrates&apos; courts.7. The Governmenfs general posture is to encourage decentralisation-tion.    The implementation of the Beeching proposals, which had almostuniversal goodwill,   was a necessary exception because the existing system of higher courts was so clearly archaic and unsatisfactory.    Itwould be a very different thing to try to sustain a case for nationalisingthe magistrates&apos; courts (a bigger service) in face of local governmentopposition, particularly from the county- councils;  and it would be particularly unfortunate to create such an issue between local and central government at a time when the changes made by the LocalGovernment Bill are being introduced.8. The preservation of locally recruited Justices (as the LordChancellor would intend) would not suffice to avoid the impression that in&quot;nationalising&quot; the magistrates  courts the Government was deliberatelyweakening the involvement of the community in the administration ofjustice - and in a field where local involvement is backed by several hundred years of history.    It does not seem that the magistrates&apos; courtscommittees would have any really effective role.    Presentationally, the government&apos;s position,would be unattractive.9. Early centralisation of the magistrates&apos; courts would raisedifficult issues about the administration of the probation and after-careservice which I should be most reluctant to confront at this particulartime.    I do not agree with the Lord Chancellors view that there is noreason why the present system of administration by committees of magistrates should not continue.    It would become an obvious anomaly if2
the magistrates&apos; courts themselves were administered centrally.    Inanything but the short term, it would be difficult to avoid transferringresponsibility for the service either to the local authorities or to central government.    Whatever the merits of the arguments that theservice should be merged with the local authority social services, the probation service is strongly opposed to it and the local authority associations do not want it at present.    It may need to be consideredone day, but nationalisation now would eliminate it as a possible courseof action for ever.    The recent report of the Expenditure Committeeon the Probation and After-Care Service recommended that &quot;theexisting local authority involvement should continue&quot; and I believe thatthis would have much support in Parliament.    The urgent need today isto secure the rapid expansion of the service and the prospect of radical changes of organisation, for which there is no support from any of theinterests principally concerned, is untimely.10.       If magistrates&apos; courts were &quot;nationalised&quot;, the Civil service would be increased by the 4, 500 staff employed in justices&apos; clerks&apos;offices, plus perhaps 200 extra staff to provide ancillary service:;; nowsupplied by local authorities.    These numbers would tend to rise.Though the rate of grant now paid by the Home Office is about 80 per cent,this is taken into account in the calculation of Rate Support Grant.The extra cost to central government funds of the transfer would therefore be about  6 miLlion of the present cost of about  15 million,rising in the likely year of transfer (1974-75) to about  9 million of the then estimated cost of  24 million.    If the probation service were&quot;nationalised&quot; the addition to the Civil Service would be about doubled,  /-with the prospect of considerable increases to come as the probationservice expanded.    The extra cost to central government funds wouldbe, at present about  6 million.11.       As the Lord Chancellor recognises, legislation to give effect tohis suggestion would have to have high priority next Session if there wasto be any hope of the centralised administration coming into being on1 April, 1974, simultaneously with the Local Government Bill.    Thiswould be a substantial Bill.    It would have to repeal and replace by new provisions the administrative provisions of the Justices of the Peace Act1949, to provide for the transfer of staff and buildings and the paymentof compensation, and to make changes relating to the jurisdiction ofjustices and the reorganisation of commissions of the peace.    I am by no means confident that we could meet this timetable even if we tried.I have in mind other measures to improve/the criminal law and its administration, which in my view are more important.12.       I accordingly propose that we should decide to preserve the essentials of the present locally based system of magistrates&apos; courts.I think that this decision should be announced and I should like this to bedone before clauses 207 and 208 of the Local Government Bill (judicialand related matters) are considered in Committee in the House ofCommons.R m home Office14 February 1972
CONFIDENTIALANNEXPRESENT ORGANISATION OF MAGISTRATES 1 COURTSMagistrates&apos; courts go &quot;back to the Justices of the Peace Act1361.   They were local institutions in origin.   Until the cominginto force in 1953 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1949 they werefinanced entirely by the local authorities, except in what is nowinner London, and individual magistrates&apos; courts were alsopractically independent of each other,2.     Under the law as changed by the Justices of the Peace Act 1949,the responsibility for administering magistrates&apos; courts rests withmagistrates&apos; courts committees, which are committees of justicesset up in each county and county borough and in certain non-county boroughs.    All counties except Rutland and the Isle of Wight, but none of the county boroughs or boroughs, are further subdividedinto petty sessional divisions, the justices of which appoint representatives to the magistrates&apos; courts committee, arrange their1own sittings, and have a statutory right to be consulted and tomake representations to the Home Secretary about any changes in the boundaries and their divisions or the appointment or removal oftheir justices&apos; clerk.   The magistrates&apos; courts committees appoint the justices&apos; clerks and the court staffs and are empowered todetermine, after consultation with the local authority, what isrequired by way of buildings, staff, furniture and other thingsnecessary to carry on the court business.    The local authority is then responsible for providing these, subject to a right of; appealto the Home Secretary It- it considers the committee&apos;s. determination to be unjustifiable or excessive.   County magistrates&apos; courtscommittees are also empowered to submit proposals to the HopieSecretary for the alteration of petty sessional division boundaries,including the amalgamation of divisions within the county. &apos; TheHome Secretary, after considering any objections, may make an ordergiving effect to the proposals with or without modification.3.     The Home Secretary has certain &quot;default&quot; powers to order the alteration or amalgamation of divisions.    In addition, he hasMinisterial responsibility for matters relating to theadministration of magistrates&apos; courts generally, including approvalof the appointment of justices&apos; clerks, and powers are being sought in&apos; the present Criminal Justice Bill to provide centraltraining of staff where appropriate and to take over from thfe localauthorities responsibility for making good deficiencies (which willsimplify auditing).   The Home Office reimburses to local authoritiesabout 80$ of the cost of the magistrates  courts.    (The preciseamount is at present determined by a rather complex formularepresenting the proceeds of certain fines and fees plus two-thirds of the difference between this sum and the actual expenditure, but thepresent Criminal Justice Bill provides for this to be replaced by a straight 80f0 grant.)-1-CONFIDENTIAL
4.     The Lord.01aatiGal.ljox&quot; (in. Lancashire, the Chancellor of the duchy) is responsible for the appointment and conditions of serviceof magistrates and for ensuring that they carry out their dutiesproperly and, in appropriate cases, for suspending them or removingthem from office.   The Lord Chancellor is also responsible for thetraining of magistrates and for making the rules of procedure formagistrates&apos; courts and the rules governing the size and composition of benches.5*     Magistrates&apos; courts, of which there are about 900, dispose ofabout 9Q&apos;/o of all criminal cases which come before the courts inEngland and Wales.    They also deal with a substantial amount of civilbusiness, mainly matrimonial cases.   The court staffs number about ,500 (including 271 whole-time and 186 part-time justices&apos; clerks).The expenditure in 1970/71 amounted to about  l&amp;n.   The probationservice, which is administered on similar linos, although separate,is of comparable size and costs about  12m a year.    These stafffigures do not include staff employed on ancillary services, whichare provided by the local authorities.   The criminal work has doubledover the last 15 years and, although the magistrates&apos; courts have onthe whole kept up with this remarkably well, the increasing burden ofwork has led to delays in some places and to various strains on thesystem, notably in the recruitment and training of staff.   As regardsaccommodation, although the expenditure on building, including costs of sites, has risen to over  6m a year, the tendency has been for theincrease in court work to outstrip the programmes.6.     There are now 149 magistrates&apos; courts committees outsideGreater London, i.e.one for each county and county borough and foreach of eight other boroughs which obtained special treatment underthe 1949 Act.   Since the Local Government Bill provides (clauses 207and 208) that there shall be a separate magistrates&apos; courtscommittee for each non-metropolitan county and each metropolitandistrict, this total will be reduced (if the Bill passes in itspresent form) to 72 (i.e. 38 county and 34 metropolitan district committees).   The reduction will affect the smaller county boroughcommittees, whose areas will, in consequence, become petty sessionaldivisions of the new counties.   Provision has also been made for theappointment of representatives to magistrates&apos; courts committees tobe determined in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary ofState, instead of there being, as hitherto, one representative foreach petty sessional division of the county concerned; the purposeof this is to enable account to be taken of the populations of the divisions, which will vary more widely after the Local government bill has come into force than they do at present.
