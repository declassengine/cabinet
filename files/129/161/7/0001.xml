They have therefore asked the Secretaries of State to initiate the legislation necessary to extend their borrowing powers.     In support of their requests they have submittedcapital development programmes and estimates of their capital requirements upto March 1978.     The Secretaries of State have considered these estimates forthe purpose of fixing borrowing limits and recommend to Parliament theproposals set out in paragraph 6 below.     The investment programmes of the boards for a period 5 years ahead will continue to be reviewed by theGovernment annually.k.     Brochures are being published by the Electricity Council and jointly bythe two Scottish Electricity Boards:   these review        progress, outlineplans for the future and give        financial estimates on which the organisa-tions&apos; requests for increased borrowing powers are based.5.    The amount which the industries will need to borrow will naturallydepend on the extent to which they can finance their capital requirements from their own resources.     The estimates of total capital requirements,internal resources and borrowing requirements for the seven years from1 April 1971 until 31 March 1978 and the implied outstanding borrowings atthe end of that period are as follows:--2 -RESTRICTED

To enable the Council and Boards to borrow the amounts needed to finance the balance of their capital requirements up to March 1978, Clause 1of the Electricity Bill provides for the extension of the borrowing limits to the amounts shown in the table below.      To ensure that parliament has the opportunity of reviewing the progress of the electricity industry in England and Wales and in Scotland within 2-3 years, theClause prescribes interim limits beyond which the Council and Boardsconcerned will not have power to borrow unless the Secretary of State makesan Order, subject to the approval of the House of Commons, raising theamount to (or towards) the final limit.RESTRICTED&quot;
	Interim	Final	limit	limit	fin	SaElectricity Council and Boards	5,200	6,500Scottish Electricity Boards	950	1,2007*     In announcing to the House of Commons on 23 November 1971 thearrangements for bringing forward . expenditure by the nationalised industries in order to provide employment in various industries, theChancellor of the Exchequer said that in some cases there would be specialpayments to the nationalised industries in respect of the additional costs incurred as a result of accelerating this expenditure.    Clause 2 of theBill empowers the Secretary of State to contribute towards expenses incurred by the Electricity Council and the Electricity Boards on expenditurebrought forward at his request for the purpose of promotingemployment.     Such contributions will be subject to Treasury approval and maynot exceed a total of  J  million for all Boards.     The provision relates to expenses incurred or projects begun before 1 April 197^.8.     Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the extension of the powers of theSecretary of State under section 19 of the Electricity Act 19^7* as amended,to transfer property between Electricity Boards.     Under present powers onlyproperty vested in the Boards by certain Acts may be transferred;   as extended the powers will apply to all property owned by the Boards and thiswill remove an impediment to technical re-organisation schemes which involvemore than one Board.     The amendment is required by the Electricity Counciland Boards in England and Wales, but the Scottish Boards have agreed that itshould cover Scotland as well.- k -RESTRICTED
