THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S government cp(72) 14 COPY NO       g 27 February 1972CABINETEUROPEAN PATENT office memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The proposed European Patent Office (EPO) presents us with our first opportunity, since the signature of the Treaty of Accession, to bidfor a major European institution in this country.    The Central policy review Staff (CPRS) considers that we should not miss this chance.2.        In the first place, our bid would demonstrate to our communitypartners our interest in the establishment in the United Kingdom notmerely of the EPO but of other more important European economic community institutions in the future.    Secondly, if our bid succeeded itwould help with our objective of making the City of London the undisputedfinancial and commercial centre of an enlarged Community.    The EPOwould become the centre for all European patenting operations, including a considerable amount of business from the United States.    The indirectbenefits which should accrue from the activities associated with these operations can only help to strengthen the City.3,        Against these important advantages the arguments against puttingin a bid do not seem to the CPRS to be at all compelling.    The initialcapital costs of accommodating the EPO would be considerable.    But asthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has pointed out in his memorandum CP(72) 13 the economic benefits to the United Kingdom wouldalso be considerable.    While finding a building may present difficulties,these surely need not be insurmountable if the objective be thoughtsufficiently worthwhile.4. Nor would putting in a bid for London be incompatible with theGovernments regional policy. It would be so only if there were any chance of the EPO being located in the regions. In fact even Londonseems unlikely to be preferred to Munich since the German governments plans are already far advanced and are thought to be supported by theFrench. Any other location in the United Kingdom would not even be astarter.1
5s The fiscal objections turn mainly on questions of presentation.    Wehave argued in Brussels against giving fiscal privileges to the EPO.    Butthe final outcome of this argument will not greatly affect the British taxpayer&apos;s responsibility for supporting the EPO, wherever its location.    Ifthe EPO were granted fiscal privileges and were then sited in London, itmight cause minor embarrassment that its staff were virtually exempt from all forms of tax.    But if, as the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry has said, the net loss in tax revenue were as little as  250, 000,this would be a small price to pay for the potential benefits to be derived.In any case we shall have to face this problem at some time; if we are notprepared to grant accepted fiscal privileges to international organisationswe shall have little chance of attracting these organisations here.RE COMMENDATION6. The CPRS recommends that the Cabinet should agree that theUnited Kingdom should put in a bid for the proposed EPO to be sited inLondon.    This would be a practical manifestation of &quot;thinking European&quot;.Cabinet office February 19722
