DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 15 COPY NO       628 February 1972CABINETUNITED KINGDOM POLICIES IN AN ENIxARGEDEUROPEAN community memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster. The Ministerial Committee on Europe recently considered theattached report by an interdepartmental group of officials under cabinet office chairmanship which was produced following an extensive reviewof the economic policies we should aim to follow as members of the enlarged European Community.    The Committee were in generalagreement with the broad principles and policy objectives recommended in the report, and in view of the great importance of the questionscovered, I was invited to arrange for the report to be circulated to theCabinet.2. The opening paragraphs of the report (paragraphs 1-6) explain that there were a number of reasons why it seemed desirable to carryout at this stage a preliminary survey of our policy objectives asCommunity members.    In particular, we need to make thoroughpreparations for the Summit conference of the enlarged Community whichit has been agreed should take place in 1972, probably in the summer orearly autumn.    It is intended that this Conference should take far-reaching decisions about the development of the enlarged Community in the years ahead, and we must clearly exploit to the full the opportunity it will providefor us to bring our influence to bear on future Community policies and toensure that they will develop along lines which will be favourable to our interests.3. The report by officials identifies five areas in which it will be ofover-riding importance to us to influence the future development of community economic policies.    These five areas are -i. and ii.    regional and industrial policies, where it is likely that we will wish to press ahead more rapidly than some of our partners with the introduction of common policies, partly because by doing so we should be able to redress the threatenedheavy imbalance between our contributions to, and receipts from,the Community budget;  and partly because the adoption of suitableCommunity policies will help us to make the most of the economicopportunities opened tip by our entry;
iii. agriculture, where it will be necessary for us toexercise a restraining influence and to seek gradually toreduce the burden which adoption of the Common agricultural policy will impose on our economy;iv. economic and monetary union;  developments here couldbe of crucial significance for the future of sterling and could have important political implications by leading gradually to a situation in which all important economic decisions were taken on a Community-basis rather than nationally;v. external commercial policies: the enlarged Community will,with the United States and Japan, have a decisive influence onthe future pattern of world trading and monetary arrangements.Economic and commercial relationships with countries outsidethe enlarged Community will almost certainly continue to be of greater importance to us than to most of our Community partnersand we must ensure that the enlarged Community uses its influence in international discussions in ways which will favourour interests.4. The report does not cover the future of European defence arrangements which are being reviewed separately.5. There are no specific issues on which the Cabinet need to reach conclusions at this stage, but I ask my colleagues to endorse the decisionof the Ministerial Committee on Europe that the further work on our european policies which will need to be pursued in coming months (inparticular in preparation for the Summit conference) should be based onthe broad order of priorities and objectives identified in the report by officials and should give special attention to the five areas mentioned inparagraph 3 above.G. cabinet Office8 February 19722
UNITED KINGDOM POLICIES IN AW ENLARGED COMMUNITYReport by the Working Group on EuropeThis paper attempts a preliminary survey of the policies we should aim tofollow as members of the European Community,   It covers not only our attitude to existing Community policies and such proposals for their futured development as have already begun to evolve within the Commission and theexisting members;   it will also be essential that we use our influence topress for Community policies to develop in new directions which would suitour interests.2.     It is important that we should now survey this field for four sets of reasons.   In the first place there are the circumstances of our entry.   Allin the Community, whatever views they have taken of our entry, are clearthat after enlargement their world will never be the same again;   a community including, in particular, the United Kingdom will not only be different but   will evolve differently from the Six.   And this, allied toa certain respect for our administrative skills and inventiveness has ledto a widespread expectation that x^e shall have a major contribution to makeafter entry not simply in administration but in new ideas as well.   Andmany in the Six would agree that new ideas are badly needed.   In particular,the Six are well aware that the Community has to work out the next steps towards economic and monetary union, with all the political consequencesthat must involve, against the  background of the monetary disarray ofrecent months.   And beyond the frontiers of tho Ten the prospects for world trade arc uncertain; no one knows how far the United States will stoor towardsprotectionism.   So a new sense of purpose and direction will be needel.3.    Much will be expected of us; if the expectations are disappointed, ourown influence will suffer badly.   We shall soon have to begin showing some-thing of our hand, for we shall be playing a full part in preparations forthe Summit meeting of heads of government of existing and prospectiveCommunity members which is to be held in 1972, probably in the summer orearly autumn.   The outcome of this meeting will determine the course ofevents in the enlarged Community for several years ahead and could wellbe at least as decisive as the previous Summit at The Hague in 1969, whichopened the way for our entry.   We must therefore be ready to make a majorcontribution to its success.1
4-     In the second place the arrangements for consultation agreed with us as a prospective member will from now on involve us increasingly in thedevelopment   of Community policies.,     The Community and the Commission havealready begun to consult us formally under the arrangements agreed for the&quot;interim period&quot; before our accession about all proposals being put to theCouncil for decision.     Equally we now have a reciprocal obligation to consult the Community about any decisions we might propose to take whichcould have an effect on the undertakings which we have given as futuremembers of the Community,,     Beyond these arrangements our views will besought increasingly by the Commission as experts on both sides get together in fields as diverse as animal health and company law.     And we must beable to give replies which fit into a coherent overall strategy.5.     Thirdly, we shall be involved already in 1972 in discreet negotiationswith the other members, actual and prospective, of the enlarged Communityabout the jobs in the Comri^sion which will go to British nationals.     Itwill be of great importance that the top fifteen or so jobs we secure -including the two Commissioners - are strategically best placed in relationto United Kingdom interests.     Before therefore deciding what jobs to go for we need to make some overall assessment of our priorities.6*     And, finally, we must ensure, as we enter into our neiir relationship with the Community, that we make a decisive break with the predominantlydefensive thinking and attitudes that have inevitably developed in ourdealings with the Six over the past decade or so.     We have becomeaccustomed to the role of &quot;demandeur&quot;, of negotiating with the Six from aposition of weakness with few useful cards in our hands.     Now thenegotiations are   Gver   our whole approach can and must change.     It is upto us through our own positive efforts to ensure that we realise all thosepotential benefits for the sake of which we have so long sought to becomeCommunity members.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES7o     A great deal of further work remains to be done in order to definemore precisely the policies we should pursue as members of the enlarged community.   But it already seems possible and desirable to lay down somebroad general principles which will provide an overall sense of direction to future work.8.     We are joining the Community in the belief that participation in a growing unity in Western Europe is the best way open to us to maintain our security and promote our prosperity.   Our main aims as members will thereforebe -a. to create the conditions within the Community in which united Kingdom commerce and industry can. best exploit the fulladvantages of a wider European market;b. to ensure that the Community^ policies evolve in such a way as to reduce the imbalance between our budgetary contributions and receipts;c. to ensure that the development of particular Community policies .in, for example, the regional field or agriculture is favourable toour interests;d. to ensure that in its dealings with third countries the tradingand financial weight of the enlarged Community is used to our best advantage;e. to develop the degree of common decision-taking within theCommunity necessary for the achievement of our other objectives.SCOPE OP THE PRESENT REPORT9o     Against this background, the remainder of this report considers what our policy objectives should be, as members of the enlarged Community, inkey areas of Community activity.   It also considers the extent to whicheconomic integration in the enlarged Community will  ,provide a basis forthe development of common foreign policies.   More detailed studies of much3
of the ground covered in this report will he circulated to Jiiniatersfor information as they are completed. In addition, further studies arebeing prepared of possible developments in Community transport policy andof environmental policy in the enlarged Community.   The implications of community membership for United Kingdom energy policy are being taken fully into account in the major review of energy policy currently being prepared;and a review of European defence arrangements   is being conducted separately.UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMIC INTERESTS10.   It is our expectation that membership of the Community will serve our national economic interest chiefly through the powerful stimulus it should give to greater industrial investment and faster economic growth.   We must,however, ensure that the resource and balance of payments costs of member-ship do not become so heavy as to constitute a serious obstacle in the wayof realising these potertial benefits.   The response of British industry -to the opportunities opened up by membership,- and the development ofexpenditure- from the Community budget, will therefore be of overriding importance to us.ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION11.   Progress towards economic and monetary union in Europe will clearly be of the greatest significance not only in itself but because of its implications for political development.   Central questions include theprovision of politically and technically acceptable machinery for economicdecision-making by the Community at the various stages, and what safeguardsare to be incorporated to mitigate the problems which a monetary union couldcreate in a Community whose constituent parts had different rates ofeconomic development.   Until we are satisfied about the latter we shallwant to retain provision for parity changes and perhaps for the use ofother instruments of economic autonomy.   Progress by the Six on all thesematters has been interrupted by the international monetary crisis, and isin general likely to be slow.   However,4
following the recent international agreement on the realignment of paritiesthe Six have &quot;begun to examine again the idea of creating an e.c. currencybloc within which dealing margins round parities would he narrower than inrelation to the United States dollar and other non-e.c. currencies; we havebeen invited to take part in the further discussions the Six will be havingabout detailed arrangements to this end and we are preparing for these discussions accordingly.COMMUNITY EXPENDITURE12o   The most immediate step we can take towards minimising our net contribution to the Community budget is to ensure that we make thorough and detailed   preparations for claiming as soon as our membership becomeseffective the largest possible return from existing programmes of Communityexpenditure.   But we must   recognise that so long as the bulk of the budget is spent on agriculture our net contributions are bound to remain uncomfort-ably large.     We must therefore aim first for the containment, and as soonas it is feasible for the reduction, in-real terms of tao Community&apos;s totalexpenditure on agriculture (see paragraphs 22-23 below).; combined withefforts to get new expenditure programmes introduced which will bo of substantial benefit to us.13.   New programmes of Community expenditure will only reduce our netcontributions to the extent that our receipts under them exceed theadditional contributions we shall be called on to make in order to financethem.   Given that, after 1976, we expect to have to meet at least17-18 per cent of any addition to the budget, we shall need to get   .a substantially bigger share than this of the receipts from any new schemesof expenditure before there is any significant reduction in our net contribution.   Even if we achieved a 25 per cent return it would take new schemes totalling some  1,200- l,400 million to reduce our net contribution by  100 million a year (the present Community budget totals just under 1,300 million).
14*   The task of reducing our net contribution to a tolerable level will therefore be a formidable one, though its urgency will to some extentdepend on how successful we are in increasing our rate of economic growthafter entry.     We shall have to rely in the main on making the othermembers of the Community realise at the right moment that unless ways and means are found of increasing our receipts we shall not be able to go onbearing the heavy burden of contributions imposed on us by the presentdirect income system.     If we can convince the Community that this is the choice they have to face, it should be possible in the end to get their agreement to schemes of Community expenditure which, although ostensiblyopen on an equal footing to all Community members, will in practice bebiassed in our favour,15,   We must bear in mind that schemes which involved scrutiny by theCommission of individual projects for which finance was sought would be unlikely to provide us with a really large total return;   what we must aim -for is Community support lor certain programmes of expenditure.     Moreoverour object should be to draw finance from the Community budget forprogrammes which would otherwise make a continuing demand on the UnitedKingdom Exchequer,     We do not want to encourage new schemes of Communityexpenditure which would involve us in a wasteful use of resources and public money,REGIONAL POLICY16.  *v7e may havo a better prospect of eventually getting substantialsupport from the Community budget for our expenditure on regional develop-ment than for any other purpose.     Until recently, the Six had made little progress towards establishing a Community regional policy, and even nowthey have only taken the first steps towards limiting the regionalincentives paid by national Governments to industry in their so-called&quot;central areas&quot;.     Our first task must be to ensure that the developmentof Community policy does not inhibit us from tackling our regional problems with a range of vigorous national measures.     There is no reason to doubt6
that we shall be successful in this though naturally the specific measureswe use will have to take account of Community thinking and practice.   Butit is likely that we shall have to press long and hard if we are to get agreement to suitable schemes of Community expenditure on regional problems.17.   The distinction the Six are drawing between &quot;central&quot; and &quot;peripheral&quot;areas reflacts the fact that they tend to see regional problems in terms of under-developmen1-. and of remoteness from the main industrial centres.   Weshall have to convince them that our regional industrial problem is of afundamentally different character from theirs.   Their problem has in themain been that of rural areas in danger of losing population as a result ofthe rapid rundown of employment in farming.   Thus the financial supportprovided by the CAP has in an important sense been directed towardsalleviating the regional problems caused by structural obsolescence inCommunity agriculture.   The comparable problem which we face is one of structural change in the older industrial areas of the country.   although we believe that entry in i+self will increase the opportunities for us toget neyj- industry into these areas, there may also be an increased tendency for industry to want to settle in areas of the United Kingdom with theeasiest access to the continent, so that our measures   to correct regionalimbalance may well need to be intensified.18.   We shall have to make a sustained effort to get the Six to accept this thesis.   We shall also need to be ready to back it up with a range of possible proposals for channelling Community funds into our regions.Further detailed work will be needed to elaborate such proposals, whichmight include a scheme for complementing EEOG-A by an equivalent Communityfund for industrial adjustment and development, of which we would get a major share.   Meanwhile it is clearly essential that in any futuredecisions that may be taken about the scope and nature of our nationalprogrammes for the regions the objective of eventually obtaining alarge return from the Community budget for this purpose should be takenfully into account.7
r* r-a**ri P&quot; &quot;T&quot;INDUSTRIAL POLICY (INCLUDING COMPETITION POLICY)Preparing British Industry for Entry19s   It has always been clear that the extent to which the United kingdom will secure economic benefit from membership depends in very large parton the extent to which British industry exploits the wider market whichwill be opened up to it in the enlarged Community.   To this end, Britishindustry should already be renewing and increasing its productive capacity.But investment is at present running at a low level and, in the present state of depression about the future, signs aro that, if anything, 1972will see the level of investment drop lower still.   Accordingly, in considering economic policy over the months ahead the Government vri.ll need to keep to the forefront the objective of restoring industrial confidence and obtaining an early expansion of industrial investment.Community Policy20.   The significance of proposals for developing a Community industrial policy does not lie so much in the possibility that they might contribute substantially to reducing our net budgetary contributions, as in the widereconomic advantages they could offer us.   (indeed, ambitious Comnunity-f jianced programmes for promoting advanced science and technology could easily involve us in wasteful use of public money and scarce resources onuneconomic projects.)   where we do stand to gain is from developments of community policy which will enable British industry to exploit to the full the potential advantages of serving a much wider &quot;home&quot; market.   We should in particular work for the removal of obstacles to the completion of thecommon market (eg by promoting technical standardisation) and for measuresto encourage structural changes in industry (eg by removing fiscal andother barriers to trans-national mergers).21,   The Community has so far adopted a pragmatic approach in the field of competition policy which is very similar to that which underlies our ownnational legislation on monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices.Further development of the Community&apos;s policy is unlikely therefore to cause us serious difficulty.   Indeed British industry is likely to pressus to work for harmonisation of national legislation within the Communityso that it will no longer suffer from the disadvantage of being subjected to stricter laws on competition than its competitors are.8
AGRICULTURE22,   We have long recognised that if we were   to become members of theCommunityj we should have to accept the CAP as it stood, despite theserious economic disadvantages it would involve for us, not only by requiring us to pay large net contributions to the budget, but also by increasing the cost of our food imports and the prices of foodstuffs toBritish consumers. The CAP has been under groat strssfl as a resultof the international currency crisis, but there seems little doubt thatthe Six (and especially the French) will ensure that the policy survivesin all its essentials-     Thus for us to influence the CAP will be a long-term process, although at the annual negotiation of Community agricultural prices in particular, we shall have the chance to steer developments inthe way we want.     Meanwhile, we must ensure that our gradual adoption ofthe CAP enables us to secure the optimum import-saving through the expansionof home agriculture, and also causes as little disruption as possible toour agricultural and food industries, our consumers and our traditionaloverseas suppliers-23.   Our aim must be to reduce in real terns the degree of support given to European agriculture through the CAP-     Although it will no doubt prove difficult to strike the right balance in any particular year,the general direction in which we shall want to move is to maintain asqueeze on agricultural prices (in real terms) - as the Six have themselvesdone in the last few years - so that farmers in the Comnmnity have to look to a combination of increases in efficiencj&apos; and a continued decline in thelabour force in order to improve their incomeso     Such a policy would be similar to the one we have pursued with some success in relation to ourown domestic agriculture since the war.     It should also be our generalaim to take any opportunities that arise to shift more of the burden ofagricultural support (eg structural expenditure) back onto national budgetsand away from the Community budget.9
OVERSEAS AID24.   At present, joint Community aid (except food aid) is provided almostentirely through the European Development Fund (EDE) to the countriesassociated under the Yaounde Convention.   When these arrangements arerenegotiated in 1973-74, we shall need to give priority to ensuring thatarrangements made to safeguard the interests of existing associates do not prevent Commonwealth associates from obtaining reasonable access to theEDF.   A great deal of any aid which Commonwealth associates draw from theEDF is likely to be spent in this country; conversely, existing associatesarc likely to spend comparatively little here.   Wo shall therefore have a significant balance of payments interest in ensuring that the Commonwealthgets as much BDE aid as possible.   We will also need to consider whetherit would be to our advantage to work for the inclusion of the EDF or anyaid which has to be given to Mediterranean associates in the generalCommunity budget (and so to be financed out of the Community&apos;s &quot;directincome&quot;),25.   Since aid is at present linked almost entirely to association, theCommunity&apos;s aid role is in fact limited.   Even if all 20 eligibleCommonwealth countries become associated, only a part of the developingworld would still benefit; and more of our own aid, and that of theother new members, would be directed to Africa, ax the expense of otherrecipients (especially those in Asia).   We shall therefore have todecide whether to support movea towards a geographically wider aid programme, directed to the developing world as a whole.   It would bein our interest to encourage this in relation to the Asian Commonwealth,whose population far exceeds that of the potential Associates and where we could expect to gain balance of payments advantages.10
26.   A geographically wider aid policy will make more and more senseas external economic policy is progressively co-ordinated by theCommunity, since aid cannot be divorced from external relations generally.We should work out a pragmatic approach towards the co-ordination ofmembers&apos; aid policies, especially towards countries assisted by the eec collectively.   There will be some initiatives in this direction whichwe shall want to encourage but others will not be in our interests.If the Community&apos;s aid programme is to widen and thus to grow, this will raise questions for all the member states of priorities for other usescf aid, both multi-lateral and bilateral.   Our own policies on this are nowunder review, and will be considered by Ministers shortly.27.   On some of these issues our interests will be similar to thoseof France, notably in getting a largo enough EDF in 1973-74- for our respective ex-colonies so maximising the flow of aid to those countries from Germany and other Community members.   On others, they will coincide-more with those of Germany, the Netherlands and the Scandinavians, forinstance in encouraging the Community to assume aid responsibilitiesoutside the African and Mediterranean associates,   France, however,will probably continue to oppose this.EXTERNAL COMMERCIAL POLICY28B   Membership of the Community will mean a radical change in the trading pattern of the United Kingdom; and our membership of an enlarged community which with the United States and Japan will be the economicgiants of the West can be expected radically to affect in due course the trade interests of other countries throughout the world and, indeed,the machinery and organisation of international trading relationshipswhich were built up after the war - principally in the GATT - and bymeans of which the world has maintained, in the main, a liberal inter-national trading regime for the past 20 years.11
29* The main export markets of the United Kingdom and of the other membersof the enlarged Community are as follows -Percentage of Total exportsby value in 1970	To -Community and other states associated^	United States	Canada Australia, New Zealand South Africa	Japan	Sino/ Soviet bloc	Other developing countriesExports from						UK	53 (of which 43 to the Community)	12	14	2	4	15Rest of Enlarged Community	73	7	3	1	4	12* This covers trade with the other nine members of the enlarged Community;the efta non-candidates 1 the existing associates of the Community; andthe Commonwealth countries to whom association has been offered.As trade develops during the 1970s with the removal of tariff and otherbarriers the proportion of United Kingdom exports going to the community and states in special trade relationship with the Community can be expectedto rise significantly - reaching perhaps 60 per cent within a few years.30o   The United Kingdom will therefore in future have guaranteed accesson duty-free or preferential terms for more than half her exports and tothat extent will be protected against any growth of protectionist policies in the rest of the world.   But the proportion of our trade going to third countries will still be substantially greater than in the case of any ofthe Six.12
31o   Secondly, the enlarged Community will have by far the largest shareof world trade and will with the United States and Japan be in a dominantposition to settle the basis on which international trade is conducted inthe years ahead -Percentage of world trade (in terms of 1970 values)Enlarged Community        37United States 14Japan 6Sino-Soviet bloc 10Others 33Accordingly x-jc must consider how we intend that the enlarged community should use its power to maintain stable and satisfactory world tradingrelations in the future.   In the present uncertainties caused by theinternational monetary crisis it is difficult to develop thinking on this very far.   But we shall have to consider the circumstances in which theCommunity should offer to participate in new trade negotiations with therest of the world and the appropriate timing of any such initiative,.   Anyfurther round of wrrld trade negotiations will almost certainly extend far beyond the discussion of tariffs and is likely to cover for example non-tariff barriers to trade (including, of course, the CAP of the Community), and perhaps the links between trade and monetary measures.   And in anticipation of such an initiative we must work out how United Kingdom interests would best be served in the negotiations.THE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OP THE ENLARGED COMMUNITY32.   We have already noted that economic and monetary union is impracticablewithout centralised decision-taking by the Community over a considerablearea of economic policy - that is, the development of some central political control over the Community^ domestic affairs.   We have also noted that the enlarged Community will, if it chooses, be able to exercise very considerablepower in establishing the   basis for the future/development of world trade.It already has the essential instruments - namely control over the external13
tariff and (shortly) over common import restrictions as well as over, forexample, the CAP - to exercise that power..   In the past, however, theCommunity has tended to adopt economic policies and to use its economicpowers largely in response to internal pressures and without taking a comprehensive view of the effects of these policies upon the rest of theworld or of its own overall interests.   It should he our aim as members toensure that in future the Community takes such a comprehensive view when considering future internal policies as well as external trading and aidarrangements.   For example, it should decide on the trading arrangementsit wishes to establish with particular countries against the background of a comprehensive view of its world economic interests as a whole.   And in establishing where these interests lie and in negotiating economic arrange-ments with particular countries - for example Japan - the Community must take into account other foreign policy considerations, including ofcourse, defence.     Thus, the active development of an external commercial policy will lead naturally and inevitably to co-ordination of memberGovernments1 external policies in fields which are not covered   at present by the economic Community treaties.     And this could form the natural basis for the development of collaboration on, and eventually for the co-ordinationof, a Community foreign policy.INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANISATION34*   As a full member of a Community in which the decisions taken affecta wide area of domestic as well as external   policies, it will be in our interest that the Community^ decision-taking procedures should be effective and be generally regarded as effective by public opinion.   At present theyare widely considered to be unwieldy and bureaucratic;    and the increase inthe size of the Community to 10 members will tend to make decisions slowerand more difficult.   On the other hand, institutional change in theCommunity is a subject which arouses strong feelings and sharp divisionsamong members, and might involve amendment to/the Treaties which could onlybe achieved by unanimous agreement and ratification.   Moreover, we shallwant to preserve the position that decisions shall in practice be taken by unanimous agreement when vital interests of one or more members are at14
35*   Against this background, the development and improvement of theConimunity fs decision-taking procedures will have to be approached cautiouslyat least over the next 2 years, until the enlarged Community has hadexperience of working on a ten-member basis.   We shall want to improve theefficiency of the Commission, but for the foreseeable future we shall want to ensure that the Council of Ministers and the Permanent Representativesretain firm control over the development of Community policy.   There willoften be advantage in attempting to agree major decisions with one or more of our major, and sometimes with some of our minor, partners in advance of formal discussion in Brussels.   We should aim to keep open the possibilityof close links, if not identity, between existing Community institutions and any institutions which may be set up (initially no doubt on a verysmall scale) to service the development of political unification.   We shouldalso work to improve the standing and public image   of the european parliament.   For example we might propose the introduction of a more effective system of Parliamentary Questions, modelled on that of Westminster.INFLUENCING THE COMMUNITIES POLICIES360   If we are to be successful in influencing the future policies of the enlarged Community and ensuring that they develop in directions   that arefavourable to our interests, we shall have to make a sustained and well-directed effort at all levels of Community discussion.   Our delegation in brussels will have a key part to play in this effort and its staff isalready being strengthened.   But Home Departments will in addition havea very large part to play and their organisation and staffing on Europeanmatters are therefore being reviewed.37*   We also need to ensure that on our accession a strong British elementis introduced into the staff of the Commission, the Council Secretariat,and other Community institutions.   We should aim to secure one of the4 top posts in the Council Secretariat and appropriate posts in the otherCommunity institutions;  we need to consider which   posts within theCommission we should particularly try to secure.15
38,   The responsibility of the Commissioners and their staff is to theCommunity as a whole rather than to their individual national Governments.But other member countries clearly regard this supra-national loyalty asbeing compatible with a continued strong awareness of national interestsand we should follow their example.     Moreover, at the purely practicallevel it is important that when the Commission come to work out howparticular policies are to be applied, some of the officials concerned should have first-hand knowledge of British conditions and requirements.39.   It has been agreed that on enlargement 2 members of the Commission of14 should be British.     The Commissioners have collective responsibilityfor all the Commission^ work, but each will probably also continue tohave individual responsibility for a specific subject.     We shall want toensure that our Commissioners obtain responsibility for subjects ofparticular significance to us.     At the most senior official level -director-general - we expert to obtain 4 or 5 posts (out of a total of 25)and similarly at the third level - director - we expect 15-20 posts (outof about 90)-     It is a general rule in the Commission that a Director-General should not be of the same nationality as the Commissioner he serves,and in any case it should be our aim to obtain posts for the BritishDirectors-General in fields of significance for us which will not be covered by our Commissioners.     Our Director posts should then ideallycover all the remaining subjects to which we attach importance.40.   In practice, what Commission jobs we obtain will be determined by along process of bargaining with the other members and by what vacanciesoccur (or can be created) in the existing staff of the Commission.     in deciding how hard to press our claim to any specific post, we shallnaturally need to consider whether the other candidates in the field wouldbe likely, if successful, to adopt an approach favourable or unfavourable to our interests.     Formally, no decisions will be taken until after our accession, but we must make every effort to reach satisfactory under-standings with the other Community members well in advance and it iscertainly not too early to decide now on a broad order of priorities.
410   The present survey suggests that in the enlarged Community it will heof the highest importance to us to influence the development of Communityregional and industrial policies, economic and monetary union and externalcommercial relations.     Agricultural policy will also clearly he of great significance to us, though our influence here will inevitably have to bea restraining one.     These are therefore the 5 subjects to which for different reasons we should give highest priority in seeking posts atCommissioner and Director-General level.     Aid and relations with the associated states, energy policy, transport policy, competition policy,environmental policy and science and technology are subjects which,although of undoubted importance, could be given lowei priority.17
