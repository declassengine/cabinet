Ti aS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(72) 22 COPY NO      g  22 February 1972CABINETPAY POLICY AFTER COALNote by the Secretary of State for employment. At the Prime Minister&apos;s request I circulate to the Cabinet theattached note on pay claims at present outstanding,, explaining the stage the claims have reached and the developments likely to follow.2. The Prime Minister has asked that the note should be consideredinitially by the Ministerial Committee on Pay Negotiations, but that itshould also be circulated to the Cabinet at the same time for discussion as appropriate at the meeting arranged for Thursday 24 February.R department of Employment22 February 1972
(secret)Note by the Secretary of State for EmploymentIn the aftermath of Wilberforce we shall clearly want to lookcarefully at the assumptions on which the current policy of de-escalation is based,  and whether these are appropriate to thefuture or need to be modified.    I shall arrange&quot; to  circulate a paper on this.    In the long run,  of course,  the balance of industrialbargaining power is vital and I shall also  circulate a papersuggesting action in that field..2.      Meanwhile, we have to deal with the cases now in or about toenter negotiation and the Prime Minister has asked for animmediate report on the outstanding pay claims,   the stage theyhave reached and what developments are likely to follow.    this paper seeks to meet that requirement in the light of lilberforce.3*      Following Wilberforce the miners will get over 20 per centin a year and their minimum pay will rise from  l8 to  23 a week.The miners  succeeded because they had great economic power andexercised it almost to  the limit.    Wo must now keep the miners as a wholly exceptional cass.    The main public sector claims coming upin the next three months and an assessment of the prospects andeconomic power behind each are described below.4.      LONDON BUSMEN    They have  just rejected 7 per cent negotiated by their union in order to  see what the miners geto    Employers and unions meet again on 23 February-    Union leaders are unlikely towant to get something extra quickly and a settlement below 8 per centin a few weeks&apos;   time is possible.     Chances of strike action appearlow and,  although this   (and possibly some related action) woulddisrupt London passenger services,   the national economicconsequence would not be serious.5.      POSTMEN    They are to be offered 7-J per cent plus  1 per cent for leave and other benefits which can be&apos;&apos;presented separately.This is unlikely now to be enough,  but even after Wilberforce asettlement may still be possible with an extra 1 per cent.    If not,then before going to arbitration they will probably take selectiveindustrial action,  which could be highly disruptive,   and to whichthe only effective counter might have to be a lock out by the PostOffice.    If there was unofficial support from the engineers - which,although possible,  is still not very likely - this would affectthe telecommunications service,  and the impact would be much more severe than last year.1
(secret)6.    TEACHERS    They have currently been offered 6 per cent and areexpected to go to arbitration.    But we shall have to move up to7 per cent now if the offer is  to be defensible at arbitration,  andwe should therefore now be prepared to take a settlement if itcan be achieved within 8 per cento    The College of Educationteachers might just possibly settle around this level this comingFriday,  which would be helpful.    If the teachers took industrial action,  it would be a not very damaging work to rule or selectedstrike action.7.    NURSES    They are being offered today (22 February) 7 per centplus -g- per cent for some special features and 1 per cent for improvements to be negotiated later in the year.    This may stillbring a settlement.    They will probably,  however,  look for some improvement and,   if not forthcoming,  rely on political pressure.8.    HOSPITAL ELECTRICIANS    They have been offered under 7 per cent and meet again on 1 March.    They say that they are looking for12 per cent or arbitration.    But they might be prepared to settle in line within the 8 per cent for the electricity supply workers.If they went on strike,  hospital electrical services would be rundown in about 6 weeks.9.    AIRLINE GROUND STAFF    They rejected in December 2-j per cent on top of the        per cent final payment under a long term agreement.Negotiations are proceeding,  but the unions have been playing itslowly.    Wilberforce may increase their expectations.    industrial action,  particularly in the tourist season,  could severely damageairline finances,  but the effects would fall short of a national emergency - unless supported by other workers.10.    RAILWAYS      The circumstances of the railwaymen are perhaps the closest to those of miners.    They have co-operated in closures;    some have seen a decline in their relative pay;    and they too have a low minimum rate which,  before Wilberforce,  they wanted raised from 17.20 to  19.40.    Though not necessarily justified,  they might present themselves as a special case.    The employers nonethelessthink a negotiated settlement under 10 per cent may still bepossible and aim (as we should wish)  to keep talks going within the 8 per cent limit and avoid bringing the negotiations to a head atleast until end March.    This is very important.    ASLEF are militant,NUR probably loss so.    Industrial action before coal stocks arerestored to reasonable levels  could bring about an emergency power situation.    Every possibility of building coal and other stocks atpower stations as rapidly as possible should be taken.    The railsettlement is repercussive on many other transport industries.11.     STEEL      This is coming to the end of a 3 year agreement -craftsmen in March,  process workers and blastfurnacemen in June.The BSC will probably want to settle all of them together.    the likely level of a negotiated settlement is not yet known.    Theunions - except the blastfurnacemen - are not usually militant,  but may find it exceedingly difficult to  settle within 8 per cent,particularly if the railways get more.    A strike would havewidespread effects on industry generally.    Much would depend onthe level of steel stocks and the ability to import.(secret)
(secret)12.      In a number of these public  sector cases we must take accountof the possibility of industrial action and assess the implications of accepting a strike as against settling above 8 per cent.    In theparticular cases of rail and steel,  we are for this purpose making an urgent special assessment of the likelihood of industrial action,its nature and timing,  and its economic impact.    We must,  however,avoid establishing another &quot;wholly exceptional&quot; case in.this payround and,  if flexibility is necessary,  we should seek it by negotiation or conciliation rather than a court of inquiry.13.      PRIVATE SECTOR   There will be difficult negotiations with somelarge engineering companies with risks of high settlements andindustrial action.    The construction industry negotiations may be particularly affected by Wilberforce.    There should be talks withthe CBI and the two  employers&apos;  federations  (EEF and NFBTE).lk.      conclusions.    We should still aim to  get public  sector settlementsover the next few months at 8 per cent or less.ii. We should urgently examine the implications of industrial action by the rail and steel workers.    This is in hand.iii. We should not have another &quot;wholly exceptional&quot; case inthis pay round.    If flexibility is necessary,  it should be by negotiation or conciliation rather than a court of inquiry.iv. We should arrange talks with the CBI and employers&apos;organisations.v. We should take all possible action to rebuild coal andother power stocks as fast as possible.R department OF EMPLOYMENT    SW122 February 1972
