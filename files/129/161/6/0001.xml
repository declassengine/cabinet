DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 6 COPY NO ^ ?14 January 1972CABINETACCELERATION OF INDUSTRIAL EXPENDITURE PROPOSAL to order NIMROD aircraft memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence and the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. At the Cabinet meeting on 18 November 1971 (CM(7l) 56th Conclusions,Minute 6) the Chancellor of the Exchequer and we were invited to examine further whether it would be possible to place an order for eight Nimrodaircraft for early completion and to avoid substantial expenditure in1974-75 and later years,2, We are affaid that there is no way of compressing expenditureon extra Nimrods into the next two years.    Production of complicatedequipment such as ships and aircraft takes time and costs are phasedaccordingly.    After discussion with the firm we now estimate that 13 million rather than   11 million would fall in the period up to March1974 but even so expenditure thereafter would be  20 million,,3. On the other hand considerable concern has been expressed latelyby MPs and others about the prospective employment difficulties in the hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) factories in Manchester (Woodford andChadderton) and Chester, where the extra Nimrods would largely be made,and with the agreement of the Chancellor, officials of the Ministry of defence and the Department of Trade and Industry have been examining with the firmwhat impact a further Nimrod order would have on the employment situation at those factories.4. The main work currently in progress consists of:a. Production of the civil HS 125.b. Production of the civil HS 748,c. The tail-end of the production of 38 Nimrods for the RAF.d. The conversion of RAF Victor aircraft into tankers,e. Production of wing sets for the A300 European Air Bus.1
50 Demand for the HS 125 and HS 748 has been declining and production is planned to continue only at a very low rate.    Work on the A300 wing v/iilsuffer a temporary lull as the transition is made to different variants of theaircraft and the Victor tanker work will do no more than help to take up slackas work on the original Nimrod order draws to an end.6. Employment at the factories has already fallen over the past year from about 12, 500 to 10, 300.    The company have confirmed our earlierbelief that with this reduced activity and unless additional orders can beobtained, there will be a further reduction to 9, 000 by 1 April 1973 and to,400 by end 1974.7. There is little prospect of expanding the current work and the only way of securing a marked improvement would be to order extra Nimrods.Discussions with the firm have established that an order for eight furtherNimrods would be expected to raise employment from 9,000 to 9, 900 at April 1973 and from 8,400 to 9,850 at end 1974.    Thus by comparisonwith present strengths further reductions would be confined to about 400over the next 15 months, after which numbers would remain virtually stable.8, Our current estimate of the number of extra jobs created at the HSAfactories (900 by 1 April 1973 and 1,450 by end 1974) is rather more than the peak of 800-1, 000 which v/as given in CP(7l) 135.    It was pointed out at thetime that the total work content would be at least 50 per cent greater but in.the absence of consultation with the firm it was necessary to take a conservative view of the number of extra jobs.    Our officials are nowsatisfied that, given the size of the Nimrod order and the decline in thework force which would otherwise take place, the revised estimates aresound.    With the extra v/ork created for Rollr-Royce (200) and the equipment firms (200) the total number of extra jobs would approach2,000.9. The substantial employment benefits of a further Nimrod ordercannot be secured without a longish spread of commitments.    Nevertheless,in the present economic situation, we suggest that a measure which somarkedly improves the prospects for the HSA factories in the North Westis fully justified.10,        If our colleagues agree that this order should now be placed, wewould suggest that an announcement should be made in reply to an arrangedParliamentary Question on Thursday 20 January when the Ministry ofDefence is first in order,CONCLUSION11.        We recommend that our colleagues should:a. Approve additional expenditure of  33 million on the purchaseof eight Nimrod aircraft for the RAF as a further measure to relieve unemployment, the defence budget ceiling being raisedaccordingly.b. Agree that an announcement should be made in the House ofCommonB on Thursday next, 20 January.
12,        The Chief Secretary has been consulted and agrees with theproposals,,    Unless our colleagues think it necessary to discuss this,in which case it could perhaps be raised at the meeting of the Cabinetarranged for Tuesday 18 January, we propose to proceed accordingly.CJ DMinistry of Defence14 January 1972
