S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 5 COPY NO  6 213 January 1972CABINETPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES ON european community MATTERSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure have considered how we can best meet the need to secure the effectiveinvolvement of Parliament after our accession to the Communities in theUnited Kingdom&apos;s part in the formulation of Community legislation andthe scrutiny of the subordinate legislation needed from time to time to giveeffect to Community legislative requirements.    We concluded that,although Community affairs would increasingly pervade the ordinary workof Parliament, additional machinery would be needed;  and that theChancellor of the Duchy, in the Second Reading of the european communities Bill, should indicate the kind of machinery which theGovernment have in mind in terms which will convey sufficientreassurance without at this stage committing us to detail or timing.    we propose that the Chancellor of the Duchy might make the following 3 points.a. That the Government recognise that the procedures ofParliament in relation to subordinate legislation must be sufficientto enable Parliament to give proper scrutiny to subordinate legislation designed to give effect to Community requirements;and we hope that the Joint Committee now examining the procedure for subordinate legislation will have this particular requirement in mind.bo That the Parliamentary programme will be arranged so asto afford a number of &quot;Community days&quot;, some of which might beat the disposal of the Opposition, for the purpose of general debate on important implications of Community policy.c. That the Government have it in mind that a Select Committee(which might be a Joint Select Committee) should be appointed forthe purpose of examining proposals that are to come before theCouncil of Ministers and the Commission which would have an1
effect upon our domestic law;  that the terms of reference and procedure of such a Select Committee would be a matter forfurther consideration and consultation.W w privy Council Office13 January 1972
