PROGRAMME OF MEETINGS4. The next general strategy meeting could appropriately take place in mid-May, by which time it will be possible to take account of the initialimpact of the Budget.5, At that meeting Ministers will no doubt wish among other things to take stock of the Governments achievements in relation to its objectives,after nearly two years in office, and to consider the broad programme ofaction for the remaining years of the present Parliament,    Thip stock-taking could in particular provide the impetus for work on outstanding areasof difficulty to be pressed forward during the summer in time for proposalsfor necessary action to be embodied in The Queen&apos;s Speech next October.6. The proposed meetings of smaller groups of Ministers on more specific issues of strategy could be organised in parallel with the majormeetings.    A suitable programme might be as follows:a. Before the May meeting, there could be a group meeting ona subject to be selected by the CPRS after discussion with departments as necessary.b. After the May meeting, there could be further groupmeetings on:i. The role of government, including devolutionand open government.ii, Priorities in social policy, on the basis of compara-tive &quot;needs&quot;, and effective mechanisms for achievingobjectives.c. Further ahead, other group meetings could be held on:i. The kind of military power we wish to be and theamount of our resources we wish to devote to being it.j.i.        The kind of Europe we want: how much integrationwe should seek, in what fields, over what time scale and by what routes.recommendations.        We invite the Cabinet -a.

annex the position reached, on the main topics discussed by Ministers at their meeting on 8 October is as follows: -a. PrioritiesReducing unemployment and controlling inflation are accepted asthe Governments first priorites for the time being.b. Unemploymenti. The economy has not yet responded adequately toreflation, and unemployment is still very high and rising.Government action is under consideration to correct this and to promote the modernisation of British industry,ii. The return to fixed parities agreed internationallyin December removes the fear that the United Statesmeasures of 15 August would lead to a general retreatinto protectionism or a world recession.    All the major&quot;Western countries are pursuing expansionary policies,iii. It is important that future balance of payments difficulties are not dealt with by stop-go polcies whichcreate unemployment.iv. Ministers have approved a programme of additional public expenditure in the next two years which will createextra jobs in that period but will for the most part avoidprojecting increased public expenditure into 1974-75 and1975-7&amp; and thus threatening the Governments taxobjectives.v. Plans for a major improvement in industrialretraining facilities have been approved by ministers and are being published as a Consultative Document,vi. Proposals for treating the United Kingdom^regional problem are being put before Ministers; these include CPRS proposals on a new longer-term strategy forthe regions,c. Inflationi. The Government has continued its policies ofexample-setting in the public sector and exerting pressure in the private sector;  some success has been achieved in reducing the rate of wage increases.
ii. Ministers collectively have not yet considered whatpolicies should be adopted when the present confederation of British Industry initiative expires in July.-iii. A dialogue with the unions, designed to encourageresponsible elements, has been maintained in the national economic Development Council.iv. Public expenditure savings have been avoided wherethe result would be to transfer new charges to the public.v. Following the announcement that social servicebenefits are to be uprated annually, further consideration will be necessary of how the worst remaining losers frominflation may be identified and protected (eg by index-linkingor fiscal adjustment).vi0       Further work needs to be done on the question of howfar present accounting practices may lead in inflationaryconditions to an overstatement of real industrial profits;the implication of this for wage claims, business confidence and Government revenue will need to be taken into account.Social policy. Decisions have been taken to allocate additional resources to the social services, primarily to help thosein most acute need; to uprate social security benefitsannually;  and to reallocate resources within education,mainly in favour of primary school replacement.ii. Measures to tackle the problem of family poverty,and to encourage the voluntary social services, are beingconsidered by Ministers.iii. A number of problem areas remain, eg the care ofchildren at risk in the social system, race relations and policy towards deprived areas.ccrocT
