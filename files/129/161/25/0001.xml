DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT ON THE PUBLICATION OFLORD PARKER&apos;S report with permission, Mr Speaker, I will now make a statement aboutthe Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors under the chairmanship of Lord Parker of Waddington.    This Report is published today;  and copies / are now available/ in the Vote Office.    The Government havenot found it necessary to omit any passage on grounds of security;  andthe Report is published with only minor amendments which do not in anyway affect the sense.The terms of reference of the Committee were to inquirewhether, and if so in what respects, the procedures currently authorisedfcr the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism, and for theircustody while subject to interrogation, require amendment.    TheGovernment are indebted to Lord Parker and his colleagues for thescrupulous care with which they have examined this very difficult subject.The Committee found themselves unable to agree;  and they have therefore submitted a majority Report signed by Lord Parker and myRt Hon and Learned Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Thames,together with a minority Report signed by Lord Gardiner.The majority find that the methods in question, which had been applied on a number of occasions in the past under successive governments in various parts of the world, were applied in NorthernIreland in August 1971 to 12 detainees, and in October to two more.They consider - and I quote - that &quot;there is no doubt that the information obtained by these two operations directly and indirectly was responsiblefor the saving of lives of innocent citizens&quot;.     They conclude that theuse of the methods involved could be justified in exceptional circum-stances subject to further safeguards which they recommend.    Theyconsider, however, that the use of these techniques in some, if not allcases, would offend against English law;  but they refrain fromexpressing any view about the position in Northern Ireland where legal proceedings which raise this issue are pending.    Lord Gardiner in the minority report considers that these methods are objectionable in all circumstances.-1-
The Government, having reviewed the whole matter with great care and with particular reference to any future operations, havedecided that the techniques which the Committee examined will not beused in future as an aid to interrogation.

TERMS OF REFERENCETo the Right Honourable Edward Heath M.P.1. We, the undersigned Privy Counsellors, were appointed to consider&quot; whether, and if so in what respects, the procedures currently authori-sed for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism and for theircustody while subject to interrogation require amendment&quot;.2. The setting up of this Committee was announced in the House ofCommons by the Home Secretary on 16th November 1971, and the final con-stitution of the Committee was made public on 30th November. We held our first meeting on 3rd December 1971. Since then we have held a number of meetings, all in private, for the purpose of hearing evidence and of discussion.In the course of our inquriy we considered some 25 written representations from members of the public and 10 from representative organisations. we heard the oral evidence of 33 witnesses, many of them from representative organisations and the Civil and Armed Services. Following precedent, however,in inquiries where there are considerations of national security, we do not propose to publish the evidence we have received, or the names of personswho have provided that evidence, whether orally or in writing.3. We would like to record at the outset the Committee&apos;s appreciation ofthe services of Mr. N. E. A. Moore, our Secretary, Mr. S. G. Evans, ourAssistant Secretary, and of all our staff.4. Unfortunately we have been unable to agree and accordingly submit tworeports:I The majority report of the Chairman and Mr. Boyd-CarpenterII The minority report of Lord Gardiner.

Our approach1. &quot; Terrorism&quot; no doubt connotes violence, and violence for politicalends. This could arise under normal conditions, in which case those suspected of such conduct would be dealt with in the same way as any other personssuspected of crime. We do not, however, construe our terms of reference as including in our inquiry ordinary police interrogation. We have accordinglyconfined our inquiry to interrogation in circumstances where some publicemergency has arisen as a result of which suspects can legally be detainedwithout trial.2. We also read our terms of reference as calling upon us to inquire quitegenerally into the interrogation and custody of persons suspected of terrorismin such circumstances in the future, and not specifically in connection with northern Ireland. In particular, we are not called upon to consider afreshmatters already dealt with in the Compton Report (Cmnd. Paper 4823).Further, while in our view the use of some if not all the techniques in ques-tion would constitute criminal assaults and might also give rise to civil pro-ceedings under English law, we refrain from expressing any view in respectof the position in Northern Ireland in deference to the courts there, beforewhom we understand proceedings which raise this issue are pending.3. As our inquiry progressed it became clear that the only &quot; procedurescurrently authorised&quot;, in the sense of authorised by the civil power, were such as could be said to comply with an interdepartmentally agreed Direc-tive on Military Interrogation dated 17th February 1965, as amended in 1967as a result of the Report of Mr. Roderick Bowen Q.C. (Cmnd. Paper 3165).A note summarising the rules of this Directive was published in paragraph 46of the Compton Report but for the sake of accuracy we set out in theAppendix such extracts from this Directive as are immediately relevant to our inquiry.4. It will be seen that this Directive, though dealing with Internal Securityoperations, refers to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treat-ment of Prisoners of War (1949) and then sets out the principles contained inthat Article. However, that Convention, Convention No III, deals with inter-national warfare and the more apt Convention is Convention No IV, dealingwith internal civilian disturbances in which Article 3 is in the same terms.5. Even so, it is arguable that Convention No IV itself does not apply inthe emergencies which we are considering and the same can be argued inrespect of our other international obligations under the European Conven-tion for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Article3) and under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 5).6. Whether any of these international obligations are applicable in circum-stances such as have occurred in Northern Ireland and, if so, whether and towhat extent the interrogations conducted there conflicted with those obliga-tions is the subject of an application to the European Commission and ac-1

It will be seen that this Directive, though dealing with Internal Securityoperations, refers to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treat-ment of Prisoners of War (1949) and then sets out the principles contained inthat Article. However, that Convention, Convention No III, deals with inter-national warfare and the more apt Convention is Convention No rv, dealingwith internal civilian disturbances in which Article 3 is in the same terms.5. Even so, it is arguable that Convention No rV itself does not apply inthe emergencies which we are considering and the same can be argued inrespect of our other international obligations under the European Conven-tion for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Article3) and under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 5).6. Whether any of these international obligations are applicable in circum-stances such as have occurred in Northern Ireland and, if so, whether and towhat extent the interrogations conducted there conflicted with those obliga-tions is the subject of an application to the European Commission and ac-
cordingly we refrain from expressing a view thereon. It is, however, in any event unnecessary for us to express a view as to the applicability of any ofthese obligations. The principles in paragraph 5 (a) and (b) of the Directivefairly set out the obligations under the Geneva Convention and those towhom it is addressed are enjoined to comply with them. In other words, if that Convention is applicable, operations that are within the Directive will bein conformity with our obligations under that Convention. Moreover, sincethe obligations in Article 3 of that Convention embrace in all material re-spects our other international obligations, operations which are in conformitywith the former will also be in conformity with the latter obligations.7. The first question therefore is whether the techniques in current use infact comply with the Directive.8. The Directive moreover sets our the limits beyond which action maynot go, and does not attempt to define the limits to which it is morallypermissible to go. Accordingly a second and more difficult question arises asto whether, even if the use of these techniques complies with the Directive,their application by a civilised and humane society can be morally justified.Some of the witnesses who appeared before us urged that this Country should set an example to the World by improving on the standards in the geneva convention and applying what were described as the basic principles of&quot;humanitarian law&quot;. They took the line that, even though innocent livescould be and had been saved by the use of the techniques described in theCompton Report, a civilised society should never use them. They argued that, once methods of this character were employed on people in detentionin order to obtain information from them, the society which employed them was morally on a slippery slope leading to the deliberate infliction of torture.It was better that servants of the State and innocent civilians should diethan that the information which could save them should ever be obtained by such methods. This approach has the attraction of relieving one of the difficult exercises of judgment involved in deciding exactly how far it is permissible to go in particular circumstances.9. Further, in considering the limits to which action may go, terminologyis not of great assistance. There is a wide spectrum between discomfort andhardship at the one end and physical or mental torture at the other end.Discomfort and hardship are clearly matters which any persons suspected of crime, under ordinary conditions, will suffer and that is accepted as not onlyinevitable but permissible. Equally, everyone would agree that torture,whether physical or mental, is not justified under any conditions. Where,however, does hardship and discomfort end and for instance humiliatingtreatment begin, and where does the latter end and torture begin? Whateverwords of definition are used, opinions will inevitably differ as to whether theaction under consideration falls within one or the other definition.The techniques and their history10. Essentially interrogation in depth consists in the main of questions and answers across a table. The techniques which have been criticised are in a sense ancillary activities. While other techniques may be devised in thefuture, the only techniques in current use are those referred to in the Compton
Report, that is, wall-standing, hooding, noise, bread and water diet and de-privation of sleep. A demonstration of these techniques was given to your committee. They have been developed since the War to to deal with anumber of situations involving internal security. Some or all have played animportant part in counter insurgency operations in Palestine, Malaya, kenya and Cyprus and more recently in the British Cameroons (1960-61), Brunei(1963), British Guiana (1964), Aden (1964-67), Borneo/Malaysia (1965-66),the Persian Gulf (1970-71) and in Northern Ireland (1971).11. The object of all the techniques undoubtely is to make the detainee,for whom information is required, feel that he is in a hostile atmosphere,subject to strict discipline, and that he is completely isolated so that he fearswhat may happen next. A further object of some of the techniques, varyingaccording to local conditions, is one of security and safety. Thus it may bevital in the detainee&apos;s own interest that he is not recognised by his fellowdetainees. It is also necessary that the detainees should not communicate with each other, or with the outside world, or get to know where they arebeing held or the identity of their guards. Finally, it is necessary to ensurethe safety of the guards and prevent the escape of the detainees. In fact,some of these techniques when applied fulfil both aims: thus the wall posturenot only ensures the safety of the guards, but also induces stricter discipline.Hooding and noise likewise have dual aims, that of security and that of producing a sense of complete isolation.12. One of the unsatisfactory features of the past has been the fact thatno rules or guidelines have been laid down to restrict the degree to whichthese techniques can properly be applied. Indeed, it cannot be assumed thatany U.K. Minister has ever had the full nature of these particular techniquesbrought to his attention, and, consequently, that he has ever specificallyauthorised their use.13. These techniques are taught at purpose-built intelligence centres whereService personnel are instructed in the art of interrogation in depth, and wheremembers of our Services are also taught to be resistant to such interrogation.Even at such a centre there are no standing orders or manuals dealing in detail with the use of such techniques, and accordingly their exact application in real life situations depends upon the training already received by those whoemploy them. It will be seen at once that such techniques can easily be usedto excess, and specially so when their use is entrusted to personnel not com-pletely trained in their use. To illustrate the matter, we understand that theService training envisages a comparatively short period at the wall and sub-jection to hooding and noise there, while the detainees are taken one by oneto be medically examined and the method of interrogation is assessed. once that interrogation has taken place, it is envisaged that normally the detaineewill be taken to a cell and not returned to the wall, or be. hooded or sub-jected to noise. In practice, it may turn out that, through lack of properaccommodation, through lack of guards, through lack of interrogators,through the need to obtain personal and medical files and such matters, the degree of use envisaged is exceeded. In those circumstances, and in theabsence of definite guide lines, there is a risk that the techniques will beapplied to a greater degree than is justified either morally or under the directive.
Medical aspects and dangers14. Provided the techniques are applied as envisaged by those responsiblefor Service training, the risk of physical injury is negligible. That was theevidence of all the medical witnesses, save that in the case of a detaineesuffering from ear damage the condition might be aggravated by the noise.15. We received a good deal of evidence on the effect of these techniqueson mental health. One of the difficulties is that there is no reliable informa-tion in regard to mental effects, particularly long-term mental effects, and, as one would expect, the medical evidence varied somewhat in emphasis. Evi-dence we have received is to the effect that, while the techniques may producesome mental disorientation, this is expected to disappear within a matter of hours at the end of the interrogation. It is true that in a small minority ofcases some mental effects may persist for up to two months. There is no evidence of a mental effect lasting longer, though very fairly all the medicalwitnesses were unable to rule out that possibility, certainly in the case of aconstitutionally vulnerable detainee. Moreover, even if the mental effect didnot disappear at once, it was impossible to say how far that was due tothe techniques employed as opposed to the anxiety state which would be induced by reason of the detainee&apos;s continued detention, and, if he gaveinformation, the guilty knowledge which he had of letting down his fellowscoupled with the fear of reprisals.16. We considered the results of such experiments as have been made inconnection with sensory deprivation. We heard evidence concerning army personnel who had been subjeoted to these techniques in order to train themin resistance. In such cases no lasting mental effect whatever has been observed, but in our opinion this is by no means conclusive. The real thingis obviously quite different from the experiment. We also heard evidence ofexperiments conducted on student volunteers, usually involving a more extreme form of sensory deprivation. In these cases many of the volunteerswere found unable to withstand such sensory deprivation for more than acomparatively short period. However, not only were the experiments againof necessity different from the real thing, but in these cases the volunteersneither enjoyed a break during which medical examination and later inter-rogation took place, nor were they members of an organisation boundtogether by bonds of loyalty which would help them to hold out.17. In the result, we have come to the conclusion that, while long-termmental injury cannot scientifically be ruled out, particularly in the case of aconstitutionally vulnerable individual, there is no real risk of such injury ifproper safeguards are applied in the operation of these techniques. We dealwith suggested safeguards in paragraphs 35 to 42 below.The value of the techniques and the alternatives18. There is no doubt that when used in the past these techniques have produced very valuable results in revealing rebel organisation, training and&quot; Battle Orders &quot;. Interrogation also sometimes had the effect of establishing the innocence both of other wanted people and of the detainee himself.
19. Coming to recent times, the position in Northern Ireland prior to august 1971 was that the Security Forces were in need of hard intelligence.Information obtained by the R.U.C. by ordinary police interrogation had failed to provide anything but a general picture of the I.R.A. organisation.As a result the Security Forces were hampered in their search for arms and explosives and in addition were liable to harass and antagonise innocentcitizens. On the introduction of internment two operations of interrogationin depth took place involving the use of these techniques. In August 197112 detainees and in October 1971 two detainees were interrogated in depth.20. As a direct result of these two operations the following new information was obtained:(1) Identification - f a further 700 members of both I.R.A. factions, andtheir positions in the organisations.(2) Over 40 sheets giying details of the organisation and structure ofI.R.A. units and sub-units.(3) Details of possible I.R.A. operations ; arms caches ; safe house com-munications and supply routes, including those across the border; andlocations of wanted persons.(4) Details of morale, operational directives, propaganda techniques, rela-tions with other organisations and future plans.(5) The discovery of individual responsibility for about 85 incidentsrecorded on police files which had previously remained unexplained.21. It is also not without significance that the rate at which arms, ammuni-tion and explosives discovered in Northern Ireland by the Security Forcesincreased markedly after 9th August, and much the greater part of the haulhas resulted either directly or indirectly from information obtained by inter-rogation in depth. Details of the total amount discovered in 1971 are asfollows:1 January to 9 August to August 31 DecemberMachine guns.........      ...           1 25Rifles...............         66 178Pistols/Revolvers     .........         86 158Shotguns      ............         40 52Rockets        ............           55Ammunition............   41000 rounds 115000 roundsExplosives     ............      1194 lbs. 2541 lbs.22. There is of course a danger that, if the techniques are applied to an undue degree, the detainee will, either consciously or unconsciously, givefalse information. So far as the operations in Northern Ireland are con-cerned, however, the information given was quickly proved to be correctexcept in a few cases in which incorrect descriptions were given of personswho could not be identified by name.23. A further advantage was the &quot; snowball&quot; effect generated by followingup the information thus obtained. Moreover, the indirect effect of these two operations of interrogation was that further information could be, and is,more readily obtained by ordinary police interrogation.
24. There is no doubt that the information obtained by these two opera-tions directly and indirectly was responsible for the saving of lives of innocentcitizens.25. We have thought it right to consider whether it is possible to obtainvaluable information of this kind by other means. There is no doubt that intime of war skilled interrogators can obtain and have obtained valuableinformation by other means by guile, by careful grouping of prisoners andmonitoring of conversations with the aid of microphones, and by the intro-duction of &quot; stool pigeons &quot;. Circumstances in time of war are, however, very different. Large resources are generally available in the form both of skilledinterrogators and guards and ample accommodation ; certainly as time goes on, if not at the beginning, ample information is available to assist inter-rogators ; there is no need or wish to keep the prisoner^ identity secret; andthere are often, as in the last War, a number of prisoners who dislike thecurrent enemy regime and are only too willing to talk. Moreover, it is doubt-ful whether today, when &quot; bugging &quot; is a well-known and unfortunately oftenused technique, its use would produce any information.26. Considerable and persuasive evidence has been put before us that incounter-revolutionary operations, and in particular in urban guerilla warfare,interrogation as conducted in conditions of war is not very effective. Whilehighly skilled interrogators might succeed in getting valuable informationover a substantial period of time, they would be unlikely to obtain it as quickly. This evidence we accept.Should these techniques be employed?27. We do not subscribe to the principle that the end justifies the means.The means, in our view, must be such as not only comply with the Directive,but are morally acceptable taking account of the conditions prevailing.28. It is at this point that we encounter divergencies of view in what is a highly emotive field. Some take the view that any attempt to disorientate the mind, to lessen the will so as to make a man more susceptible to oralinterrogation is, if not mental torture, at any rate not humane, and that thetechniques in any form are humiliating or degrading. Others claim that thetechniques produce no more than hardship and discomfort for a short period.29. The true view, it seems to us, must depend upon the degree to whichthe techniques are applied. It is one thing, for instance to keep a detaineeat the wall, hooded and subjected to noise, for x hours before oral interroga-tion, and thereafter to return him to a cell unhooded and not subjected tonoise. It is another to keep him under these conditions at the wall for 2xhours and to return him to the wall after interrogation again hooded andsubjected to noise. It must also depend on the length of time during whichhe is deprived of sleep or given a restricted diet. And all these matters depend upon the medical condition of the detainee. What would be intolerable fora man in poor health might amount to no more than inconvenience for a fitman.30. Whether or not what is done is in conformity with the Directive falls in our view to be judged by how a dispassionate observer- would view the
operation if he saw the techniques being applied. Further, we think that suchexpressions as &quot; humane &quot;, &quot; inhuman &quot;, &quot; humiliating &quot; and &quot; degrading &quot;fall to be judged by such an observer in the light of the circumstances inwhich the techniques are applied, for example, that the operation is takingplace in the course of urban guerilla warfare in which completely innocentlives are at risk ; that there is a degree of urgency ; and that the security and safety of the interrogation centre, of its staff and of the detainees are important considerations.31. Viewed in this way we think that the application of these techniques,subject to proper safeguards, limiting the occasion on which and the degree to which they can be applied, would be in conformity with the Directive.; 32. So far as the moral issue is concerned, we feel that in a limited numberof situations, in particular those in which urban guerillas are concerned,the attitude taken up by the witnesses as set out in paragraph 8 is unrealisticand one which is. unfair both to the State and to law abiding citizens. More-over, circumstances can be envisaged in which &quot; humanitarian &quot; law as wellas domestic law will allow a measure of self-defence. The public emergenciesin which alone we are concerned, though short of war in its ordinary sense,are in many ways worse than war. Guerilla warfare will be taking place within the country; friend and foe will not be identifiable ; the rebels maybe ruthless men determined to achieve their ends by indiscriminate attacks on innocent persons. If information is to be obtained, time must be of the essence of the operation.33. We have also considered the argument that, however careful the selec-tion of detainees for interrogation in depth, it may on occasion involve theinterrogation of a man wrongly suspected. It can accordingly be argued thatto subject such a man to these techniques is something which should not be tolerated. There is some force in this argument, but it must be rememberedthat even under normal conditions it is accepted that a person suspected of ordinary crime, who may thereafter be found not guilty, can be subjected tosome measure of discomfort, hardship and mental anxiety. Moreover, interro-gation in depth may itself reveal the innocence of the detainee and allow of his release from detention.34. We have come to the conclusion that the answer to the moral questionis dependent on the intensity with which these techniques are applied and onthe provision of effective safeguards against excessive use. These safeguardsare dealt with in the following paragraphs. Subject to these safeguards wei have come to the conclusion that there is no reason to rule out these tech-techniques on moral grounds and that it is possible to operate them in a mannerconsistent with the highest standards of our society. .Recommended Safeguards35. It is, however, we think of importance that, except&apos;in so far as their use is required for purposes of security and safety, these techniques should only be used in cases where it is considered vitally necessary to obtain information.36. Whether the techniques are used only for the purposes of security and safety or also for the purpose of obtaining information, care should be taken
that they are only applied in conformity with the Directive. Accordingly, wethink that there should be guidelines to assist Service personnel as to the degree to which in any particular circumstances the techniques can beapplied. We suggest guidelines as opposed to rules because we recognise thatit may sometimes be impracticable to comply fully with them. Some discre-tion must be left to the man in charge of the operation, but any departure from them should be the subject of a special report to his superior officer.37. We are satisfied that Her Majesty&apos;s Forces should neither apply nor beparty to the application of these techniques except under the express authorityof a U.K. Minister. It follows that if he is to authorise their applicationhe must have full knowledge of what they involve and of the persons towhom they are to be applied. He must, in the light of the conditions prevail-ing, decide whether and to what extent their application is necessary. Heshould also lay down guidelines as to their use for the assistance of service personnel. These will for obvious reasons have to remain secret and wesuggest that the Minister might be advised by a small and experiencedCommittee whose members are appointed by the Prime Minister after con-sultation with the Leader of the Opposition. Such a Committee should alsobe informed of, and keep under review, any new techniques which may inthe future be developed.38. Despite the clear instructions in paragraph 6 of the Directive, it doesnot appear that in the past much, if indeed any, consideration has been givento the domestic law of the country in which it is considered necessaryto employ the techniques. We have in mind that the application of some, ifnot all, the techniques may in the country concerned constitute criminalassaults, even if care is taken not to use violence, and could also give riseto civil action. If the suggestions we have made are adopted it would befor the Minister concerned to take advice as to the legal position and if need be to take steps to ensure protection for those taking part in theoperation.39. It is, we think, important that there should always be a senior officerpresent at the interrogation centre who is recognised as being in overallcontrol and who will carry personal responsibility for the operation. Thechain of command and responsibility above him and to the Minister shouldbe clear.40. We trunk that a panel of highly skilled interrogators should be kept in being. This would, among other things, tend to reduce the number of occa-sions on which there would be a real necessity to use these techniques. Whereit is necessary to use them, it is highly desirable that they should be in thehands of skilled and experienced interrogators, assisted by guards and staff who are under strict discipline. Mr. Roderic Bowen, Q.C., recommendedthat the interrogators employed should be civilians. While not disagreeingwith that recommendation in relation to Aden, we do not think that it shouldbe adopted generally. Unless therefore there are other and overriding con-siderations, for example, difficulties of language, the operation should, in ourview, be conducted by Service personnel.
41. We think that a doctor with some psychiatric training should be present at all times at the interrogation centre, and should be in a positionto observe the course of oral interrogation. It is not suggested that he shouldbe himself responsible for stopping the interrogation rather that he shouldwarn the controller if he felt that the interrogation was being pressed too farhaving regard to the demeanour of the detainee, leaving the decision to thecontroller. This should be some safeguard both for the constitutionallyvulnerable detainee and at the same time for the interrogator.42. We think that, when these techniques are employed, machinery shouldbe set up to ensure that complaints are passed on to the Ministry con-cerned and that a person or body should&apos; be appointed to investigate anysuch complaints. In this connection it might be advisable to have a represen-tative of the civil authority present at the interrogation centre. The existenceof such machinery for the receipt and investigation of complaints would goa long way to ensure that the operation was conducted within the limitsauthorised. In this connection we think it is important that careful recordsbe kept of the movement and treatment of those being interrogated.Parker of Waddington(Chairman)John Archibald Boyd-CarpenterN. E. A.

II.  THE MINORITY report. I very much regret that I am unable to agree with my distinguishedcolleagues in their report.2. It seems to me clear that the &quot; procedures &quot; which our terms of refer-ence require us to consider are the procedures of &quot; interrogation in depth &quot;so described in the report of the Compton Committee of 3rd November1971 (&quot; the first Compton report&quot;) and in the further report of Sir EdmundCompton of 14th November (&quot; the second Compton report &quot;). If there were any doubt, it is clear from the statements in the House of Commons madeby the Home Secretary on 16th, 17th and 29th November and by the Ministerof State for Defence on 9th December that those are the &quot; procedures &quot; in-tended to be referred to.3. The questions which arise therefore appear to me to be:(a) Of what did those &quot; procedures &quot; consist?(b) Were they &quot; authorised &quot;?(c) What were their effects?id) Do they, in the light of their effects, require amendment and, if so, in what respects?Of what did those Procedures Consist?4. The first Compton report considered the cases of 11 out of 12 menWho had been submitted to &quot; interrogation in depth &quot; at an interrogationcentre in Northern Ireland from 11th to 17th August 1971 and the secondCompton report considered the case of one of two men who had been so interrogated from 11th to 18th Ootober.5. Their conclusions were that the procedures consisted of:(a) Keeping the detainees&apos; heads covered by a black hood except whenbeing interrogated or in a room by themselves and that this con-stituted physical ill-treatment.(b) Submitting the detainees to continuous and monotonous noise of avolume calculated to isolate them from communication and that thiswas a form of physical ill-treatment.(c) Depriving the detainees of sleep during the early days of the opera-tion and that this constituted physical ill-treatment.(d) Depriving the detainees of food and water other than one round of bread and one pint of water at six-hourly intervals and that thisconstituted physical ill-treatment for men who were being exhaustedby other means at the same time.(e) Making the detainees stand against a wall in a required posture (fac-ing wall, legs apart, with hands raised up against wall) except forperiodical lowering of the arms to restore circulation, and that
detainees attempting to rest or sleep by propping their heads againstthe wall were prevented from doing so and that, if a detaineecollapsed on the floor, he was picked up by the armpits and placedagainst the wall to resume the required posture and that the action taken to enforce this posture constituted physical ill-treatment.They found that the 11 men were at the wall for periods totalling 9, 9,13, 14, 15, 20, 23, 29, 30, 40 and 43\ hours. The second Compton reportshows that the man the subject of that report was at the wall for periodstotalling 35 hours.6. I have thought it essential to state what the procedures referred to inthe Compton reports were because they were never published or even writtendown anywhere. We have been told that these procedures of interrogation in depth, namely hooding, a noise machine, wall-standing and deprivation ofdiet and sleep, were never committed to writing in any directive, order,syllabus or training manual. They had been for some time orally taughtfor use in emergency conditions, in Colonial-type situations, at an armyintelligence centre in England. They had been used in Aden, although,surprisingly, it does not appear from the report of Mr. Roderic Bowen, Q.C.,on Interrogation in Aden (Cmnd. 3165 of 1966) that he ever discoveredthat these interrogation procedures were used there. Officers and men of theEnglish Intelligence Centre held a seminar on the procedures in NorthernIreland in April 1971 to teach orally the procedures to members of theRoyal Ulster Constabulary ; officers from the English Intelligence Centrewere present in the control room of the interrogation centre in NorthernIreland throughout the periods covered by the Compton reports. ;7. We are not a court of appeal from the Compton Committee and I accept their conclusions subject to the following points:(a) While records were kept of the movements of the detainees for11th, 12th and 13th August, the records for most of them were dis-continued some time on 14th or 15th and for four on 16th August,so that the figures of wall-standing in the first Compton report onlyrelate to the dates for which there were records, wall-standing beingdiscontinued thereafter.(b) The report does not indicate for how long any detainee was standingcontinuously at the wall. We have seen copies of the partial records.They show that, subject to breaks for bread and water and fortoilet visits, some detainees were standing continuously at the wallfor periods of 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9,-   10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 hours.(c) The first Compton report states in paragraph 68 &quot; Weight. the records kept by the doctor for each detainee on entering and leaving the centre all show loss of weight during the time spent there.&quot; Wehave ascertained that, as there was no weighing machine when the11 men arrived, the recorded entry weights were mere estimates madeby the doctor looking at the man. On the assumed weights therewere losses up to 1 stone 2 lbs. in six days.
(d) In paragraph 105 of the first Compton report the Committeesay &quot; We consider that brutality is an inhuman or savage form ofcruelty, and that cruelty implies a disposition to inflict suffering,coupled with indifference to, or pleasure in, the viotim&apos;s pain.&quot; Xestby silence I should be thought to have accepted this remarkabledefinition, I must say that I cannot agree with it. Under this definition,which some of our witnesses thought came from the Inquisition, if aninterrogator believed, to his great regret, that it was necessary for him to cut off the fingers of a detainee one by one to get the re-quired information out of him for the sole purpose of saving life,this would not be cruel and, because not cruel, not brutal.Were they Authorised?8. We have found this a point of some difficulty because our terms ofreference appear to assume that the procedures were or are authorised. Theonly evidence before us on this point was that it could not be said that.K. Ministers had ever approved them specifically, as opposed to agreeingthe general principles set out in the Directive on Military Interrogation. Ifany document or Minister had purported to authorise them, it would havebeen invalid because the procedures were and are illegal by the domestic lawand may also have been illegal by international law. I regard this point as so important that I must develop it.9. I agree with my colleagues that the only relevant document is the directive. This lays down two requirements:(a) Those concerned are to acquaint themselves with the laws of thecountry concerned, and are not to act unlawfully under any circum-stances whatever.(b) They are to follow the principles laid down in Article 3 of the geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War(1949) and these include the prohibition of &quot; outrages upon personaldignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment&quot;.10. Domestic law(a) By our own domestic law the powers of police and prison officers are well known. Where a man is in lawful custody it is lawful to do anything which is reasonably necessary to keep him in custody but itdoes not further or otherwise make lawful an assault. Forcibly tohood a man&apos;s head and keep him hooded against his will and hand-cuff him if he tries to remove it, as in one of the cases in question,is an assault and both a tort and a crime. So is wall-standing ofthe kind referred to. Deprivation of diet is also illegal unless dulyawarded as a punishment under prison rules. So is enforced depriva-tion of sleep.(b) In Northern Ireland in normal times the powers of the police andprison officers in relation to those in custody are substantially thesame except for an immaterial difference in their Judges&apos; Rules. Ofthe Regulations scheduled to the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)Act (Northern Ireland) 1922, Regulation 10 provides that &quot; Any-
officer of The Royal Ulster Constabulary, for the preservation of thepeace and maintenance of order, may authorise the arrest withoutwarrant and detention for a period of not more than 48 hours ofany person for the purpose of interrogation &quot;. This Regulation doesnot in any way extend the ordinary police powers as to the per-missible methods or limits of interrogation. Regulation 11 provides a limited power of detention and a limited right to photograph andfinger-print and Regulation 12 a limited right of internment. Regula-tion 13(5) provides that &quot; Persons detained or interned in any of her majesty&apos;s prisons shall be subject to any rules for the governmentof prisoners awaiting trial including such general rules as are applic-able to such prisoners, for the time being in force, except in so faras the said rules are inconsistent with this regulation&quot;. We have seen the Prison Rules and certain Directions made by the Ministerfor Home Affairs, Northern Ireland, with regard thereto. There is nothing in them to extend the ordinary police powers of interrogationor to validate the procedures.(c) We have received both written and oral representations from manylegal bodies and individual lawyers from both England and NorthernIreland. There has been no dissent from the view that the proceduresare illegal alike by the law of England and the law of NorthernIreland. We have seen the Constitution of Aden and the relevantStatutory Instruments and Regulations relating to Aden and thesame applies to Aden law.(d) This being so, no Army Directive and no Minister could lawfullyor validly have authorised the use of the procedures. Only Parlia-ment can alter the law. The procedures were and are illegal.11. International law(a) It has been submitted to us that the procedures also involvedinfringement of(i) Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides that&quot; No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhumanor degrading treatment or punishment &quot;.(ii) Articles 7 and 10 of The International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights (which the United Kingdom has signed butnot yet ratified) which provides that&quot; 7. No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruelinhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular,no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medicalor scientific experimentation.10. (i) All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity ofthe human person &quot;.(iii) Article 3 of each of the four Geneva Conventions scheduled tothe Geneva Conventions Act 1957 which, so far as material,provides that
&quot;In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Con-tracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be boundto apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities,including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness,wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely . . .To this end the following acts are and shall remainprohibited at any time and in any place whatsoeverwith respect to the above-mentioned persons:(a) Violence to life and persons, in particular,murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture ;...............(c) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particularhumiliating and degrading treatment &quot;.(i) Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights which provides that&quot; 3. No one shall be subject to torture or to inhumanor degrading treatment or punishment&quot;.Article 15(i) provides that in time of war or other publicemergency &apos;Some of the provisions of this Convention may bederogated from but Article 15(a) provides that &quot; No derogationfrom . . . Article 3 . . . shall be made under this provision.&quot;(b) I do not propose to express any opinion on these submissions because(i) It may be open to argument which Convention or Conventionsapply in the conditions of Northern Ireland.(ii) The most eminent lawyers notoriously differ on questions of construction. Words like &quot; torture &quot;, &quot; inhuman &quot; and &quot; degrad-ing &quot; are clearly open to doubt.(iii) As the procedures were admittedly illegal by the domestic lawand no Minister had power to alter the law, it is not necessary,for the purpose of the point I am discussing, to decide whetheror not they were also illegal by international law.(iv) The Government of the Republic of Ireland has laid a complaint of a breach or breaches of The European Convention before theEuropean Commission on Human Rights. This question istherefore sub judice and it would not, I think, be proper forme, unnecessarily, to express any opinion upon it.What Were Their Effects?12. It is necessary to consider this in some detail. The situation in NorthernIreland is one in which members of the Irish Republican Army are conductinga campaign of terror which includes brutal murders, arson, the - use ofexplosives against innocent men, women and children and outrages of all
kinds. There is virtually a war going on between the Government of NorthernIreland and the Irish Republican Army and in this conflict the lives, notonly of innocent civilians but of the police and army, are at stake in circum-stances of appalling difficulty for the members of those forces whose courage,resolution and behaviour are all so well known.It has been submitted to us that because these things are so and in myopinion they are so the procedures were necessary to obtain, for the purposeof saving lives, information which could not otherwise have been obtainedor alternatively not obtained so quickly, that they are therefore morallyjustifiable, that the same may well be so in future conditions of emergencyelsewhere and that the procedures with such amendments as may be thought desirable, should remain available.This raises questions, including moral questions, which cannot bedetermined without considering the effects of the procedures on the obtainingof intelligence information, on the detainees, on the relations between theforces of law and order and the people of Northern Ireland and on the reputation of the United Kingdom.13. Their effect on the detaineesTheir immediate effect was on the detainees. We have had to considerboth the physical effects and the mental effects.(a) Physical effects(i) It would seem unlikely that the procedures would not result insome minor physical injuries. Eleven men made complaints of physical ill-treatment and some of them who had no injuries on arrival at the interrogation centre were found by the ComptonCommittee to have had minor injuries when they left. Likethe Compton Committee we have not seen any of the detaineesand, like them, we cannot say how these injuries wereoccasioned.(ii) We have received unchallenged medical evidence that sub-jection to a noise level of 85 decibels (at the interrogationcentre it was 85 to 87 decibels) for 48 hours might result for per cent, in temporary loss of hearing and in 1 per cent,(with ear disorders) in some permanent loss of hearing.(b) Mental effects(i) We have received a great deal of evidence from medical expertson this question.According to our information, interrogation in depth as described in the first Compton report is a form of sensoryisolation leading to mental disorientation which was itselfinvented by the K.G.B. in Russia where they first placedsuspects in the dark and in silence.As one group of distinguished medical specialists put it&quot; Sensory isolation is one method of inducing an artificialpsychosis or episode of insanity.   We know that people who
have been through such an experience do not forget it quickly and may experience symptoms of mental distress for months oryears. We know that some artificially induced psychoses, forinstance those produced by drugs like L.S.D. or mescaline, have in fact proved permanent; and there is no reason to suppose that this may not be a danger with psychoses produced bysensory deprivation. Even if such psychotic symptoms asdelusions and hallucinations do not persist, a proportion ofpersons who have been subjected to these procedures are likelyto continue to exhibit anxiety attacks, tremors, insomnia, night-mares and other symptoms of neurosis with which psychiatristsare familiar from their experience of treating ex-prisoners ofwar and others who have been confined and ill-treated.&quot;(ii) There is a considerable bibliography of experiements in this field, particularly in Canada. Some experiments have beendone in England with troops and civilian volunteers, but it wasthe cumulative effect of the techniques which was important in the present context and naturally neither troops nor civilianshad ever been submitted to such cumulative techniques as were used in Northern Ireland and it was impossible scientifically to prove that they would, or that they would not, have lastingeffect. Some of our medical witnesses believed that they would,but others thought that they would not last more than twomonths. All emphasised the fact that in the field of mentaldisorientation everyone had a different threshold, which madethe imposition of specific time limits of great, and some thoughtinsuperable, difficulty.(iii) In an experiment in England, fully described in the &quot; Lancet &quot;of 12th September, 1959, 20 men and women volunteer mem-bers of a hospital staff, aged between 20 and 55 were eachplaced in a &quot; silent room &quot; standardised up to a mean sound-pressure-level difference of 80 decibels and the further sensorydeprivation consisted of having to wear translucent goggleswhich cut out patterned vision and padded fur gauntlets. Onthe other hand they had four normal meals a day when theywere visited by colleagues on the hospital staff and could takeoff the goggles and gloves, and they had &quot; dunlopillo &quot; matt-resses on which they could sleep or rest, or they could walkabout. They were promised an amount of paid time off equalto that spent in the room and were asked to stay there as longas they could.7. Six remained for 48, 51, 51, 75, 82 and 92 hours, but 14 ofthe 20 gave up after less than 48 hours (two of them after only hours), the usual causes being unbearable anxiety, tensionor attacks of panic. Dreams were invariable in those who sleptfor any length of time and in a quarter of the 20 includednightmares of which drowning, suffocating, killing people etc.were features.1.7
These were the results although they were volunteers in theirown hospital who knew that there was no reason for any panicand who were not submitted to any wall-standing or deprived of any food or sleep.14. Their effect on the obtaining of information(a) There is no doubt that a considerable quantity of intelligence infor-mation was obtained at the intelligence centre in Northern Irelandwhich, in the opinion of the army and of the interrogators, wouldnot have been obtained or not so quickly, by other means.(b) On the other hand(i) Some of the 14 were only too anxious to give information andwere &quot; co-operative &quot; from the start and in their case the pro-procedures appear to have been unnecessary.(ii) During the period after 9th August there was a sudden and considerable increase in the number of people arrested andquestioned so that a dramatic increase in intelligence informa-tion was in any case to be expected, whether or not those in-terrogated were submitted to ill-treatment.(iii) An important element in the procedures was their surprise:once their nature and limits were known, their effect would naturally be greatly limited.(iv) It is natural that those applying the procedures should considerthat they would not have obtained so much information, ornot have obtained it so quickly, by other means.(c) We have read a number of statements made by men who interro-gated thousands of prisoners and some civilian suspects in the lastworld war and have heard oral evidence thereon.(i) Article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention provides that&quot; No physical or mental torture, nor any other form ofcoercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, orexposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment ofany kind.&quot;It must have been appreciated by our Government when itsigned the Convention in 1949 and ratified it in 1958 that intime of war there is a pressing need to obtain information fromcaptured soldiers, information upon which the very survival of the State and the outcome of the war might depend.(ii) The evidence we heard from the main interrogation centresduring the war where so much vital information was obtainedwas that the prisoners and suspects were treated with kindnessand courtesy and without anything which would contraveneArticle 17, that, as is now well known, it was accompaniedby interrogation, the cross-referencing of information and theuse of microphones and &quot; stool pigeons &quot; in cells.  We wereIS
told that there were occasions when information was wanted,and was obtained in a matter of hours, relating particularly tothe course of U-boat packs or the path to be taken on the nextair-raid and that, even after the Germans knew of the methods and warned their men about microphones in cells and theuse of &quot; stool pigeons &quot;, the methods were still effective owingto the overwhelming desire to take to another human beingwhatever the circumstances.(iii) The planning of the interrogation centre in Northern Irelandbegan in March 1971. There was ample time to train a team of interrogators in our well tried and effective war-time methods.(iv) I am not persuaded that substantially as much informationmight not have been obtained by those methods.15. Their effect on the relation between the forces of law and order andthe people of Northern IrelandIf, however, the view is taken that the use of the procedures may initiallyhave saved lives, this has to be balanced against the fact that in a guerilla-type situation the position of the forces of law and order depends very much on how far they have the sympathy of the local population against theguerillas. If the sympathy of a large part of the population is lost, the diffi-culties of the forces of law and order are increased. How far the loss ofthat sympathy since 9th August is due to internment or to the proceduresor how far in the end they may have saved lives or cost lives, seems to meimpossible to determine.16. Their effect on the reputation of the United KingdomIt is more convenient to deal with this under the next question to beconsidered.Do they, in the light of their effects, require amendment and, if so, in whatrespects?17. Our terms of reference are no doubt expressed as they are because itwas assumed that the procedures were authorised. As, however, they werenot authorised the question which really arises is &quot; should the proceduresbe continued, or abandoned or amended and, if amended, in what respects? &quot;18. As they were illegal by our domestic law and by the domestic law of aden and of Northern Ireland and are likely to be so by the domestic law of any place in which we might consider their use, and as no Minister canalter the law, their use cannot be continued without legislation.19. The real question at the end of the day, therefore, is whether weshould recommend that Parliament should enact legislation making lawfulin emergency conditions the ill-treatment by the police, for the purposeof obtaining information, of suspects who are believed to have such infor-mation and, if so, providing for what degree of ill-treatment and subject towhat liihitations and safeguards.
20. I am not in favour of making such a recommendation for each of thefollowing five reasons:(1) I do not believe that, whether in peace time for the purpose ofobtaining information relating to men like the Richardson gangor the Kray gang, or in emergency terrorist conditions, or evenin war against a ruthless enemy, such procedures are morallyjustifiable against those suspected of having information of import-ance to the police or army, even in the light of any marginaladvantages which may thereby be obtained.(2) If it is to be made legal to employ methods not now legal againsta man whom the police believe to have, but who may not have,information which the police desire to obtain, I, like many of our witnesses, have searched for, but been unable to find, either in logicor in morals, any limit to the degree of ill-treatment to be legalised.The only logical limit to the degree of ill-treatment to be legalisedwould appear to be whatever degree of ill-treatment proves to benecessary to get the information out of him, which would include,if necessary, extreme torture. I cannot think that Parliament should,or would, so legislate.(3) Our witnesses have felt great difficulty in even suggesting anyfixed limits for noise threshold or any time limits for noise, wall-standing, hooding, or deprivation of diet or sleep.All our medical witnesses agreed that the variations in whatpeople can stand in relation to both physical exhaustion and mentaldisorientation are very great and believe that to fix any suchlimits is quite impracticable. We asked one group of medicalspecialists we saw to reconsider this and they subsequently wrote to us&quot;Since providing evidence to your Committee we have givenmuch thought to the question of whether it might be possibleto specify reasonably precise limits for interrogators and thosehaving charge of internees. The aim of such limits would be to define the extent of any &apos; ilRreatment&apos; of suspects so that one could ensure with a high degree of probability that no lastingdamage was done to the people concerned.After a further review of the available literature, we havereluctantly come to the conclusion that no such limits can safely be specified. Any procedures such as those described inthe Compton Report designed to impair cerebral functions sothat freedom of choice disappears is likely to be damaging tothe mental health of the man. The effectiveness of the proceduresin impairing willpower and the danger of mental damage arelikely to go hand in hand so that no safe threshold can be set.&quot;(4) It appears to me that the recommendations made by my colleagues in the concluding part of their Report necessarily envisage oneof two courses.
One is that Parliament should enact legislation enabling a Minister,in a time of civil emergency but not, as I understand it, in time ofwar, to fix the limits of permissible degrees of ill-treatment to beemployed when interrogating suspects and that such limits should then be kept secret.I should respectfully object to this, first, because the minister would have just as much difficulty as Parliament would have in fixing the limits of ill-treatment and, secondly, because I view withabhorrence any proposal that a Minister should in effect be em-powered to make secret laws: it would mean that United kingdom citizens would have no right to know what the law was aboutpolice powers of interrogation.The other course is that a Minister should fix such secret limitswithout the authority of Parliament, that is to say illegally, and then,if found out, ask Parliament for an Act of Indemnity.I should respectfully object even more to this because it wouldin my view be a flagrant breach of the whole basis of the rule of Law and of the principles of democratic government.(5) Lastly, I do not think that any decision ought to be arrived atwithout considering the effect on the reputation of our own country.For many years men and women and a number of international organisa-tions have been engaged in trying patiently to raise international moralstandards, particularly in the field of human rights. The results are to befound in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the four GenevaConventions, which 129 countries have signed and ratified, the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and The European Convention on human Rights, whose provisions are referred to in paragraph 11 above.And this is not all. The World Conference on Religion and Peace, repre-sentative of all the world&apos;s religions, held in October 1970 declared&quot;The torture and ill-treatment of prisoners which is carried outwith the authority of some Governments constitute not only a crimeagainst humanity, but also a crime against the moral law &quot;while the subsequent Consultation of all the Christian Churches declared&quot; There is today a growing concern at the frequency with which some authorities resort to the torture or inhuman treatment of political opponents or prisoners held by them. . . . There exists at the presenttime, in certain regions of the world, regimes using systematic methodsof torture carried out in the most refined way. Torture itself becomescontagious .... The expediency of the moment should never silencethe voice of the Church Authorities when condemnation of inhumantreatment is called for.&quot;There have been, and no doubt will continue to be, some countries which actin this way whatever Conventions they have signed and ratified. We havenot in general been one of these. If, by a new Act of Parliament, we nowdepart from world standards which we have helped to create, I believethat we should both gravely damage our own reputation and deal a severeblow to the whole world movement to improve Human Rights.
21 conclusion cannot conclude this report without mentioning two points:(1) An eminent legal witness has strongly represented to us that asArticle 144 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that&quot; The High Contracting Parties undertake, in time of peace asin time of war to disseminate the text of the present convention as widely as possible in their respective countries, and, inparticular, to include the study thereof in their programmes ofmilitary and, if possible, civil instruction, so that the principlesthereof may become known to the entire population &quot;and as the other three Geneva Conventions contain somewhat similarArticles, and as we do not appear to be complying with these pro-visions, some step should now be taken to incorporate such instruc-tions in military training.As we have been told by those responsible that the army neverconsidered whether the procedures were legal or illegal, and as somecolour is lent to this perhaps surprising assertion by the fact thatthe only law mentioned in the Directive was the wrong geneva convention, it may be that some consideration should now be giventhis point.(2) Finally, in fairness to the Government of Northern Ireland and theRoyal Ulster Constabulary, I must say that, according to the evidence before us, although the Minister of Home Affairs, Northern Ireland,purported to approve the procedures, he had no idea that they wereillegal; and it was, I think, not unnatural that the Royal ulster constabulary should assume that the army had satisfied themselves that the procedures which they were training the police to employwere legal.The blame for this sorry story, if blame there be, must lie with thosewho, many years ago, decided that in emergency conditions in Colonial-type situations we should abandon our legal, well-tried and highly successfulwartime interrogation methods and replace them by procedures which weresecret, illegal, not normally justifiable and alien to the traditions of what i believe still to be the greatest democracy in the world.Gardiner.31 January 1972.
ExtractJIC(65)15(amended)17th February 1965(as amended 10th February 1967)JOINT DIRECTIVE ON MILITARY INTERROGATION in internal SECURITY OPERATIONS OVERSEASIntroductionPersons arrested or detained during Internal Security operations or innear emergency situations are likely to be valuable sources of intelligence.They may be the only source of intelligence at a time when it is urgently required.2. Successful interrogation depends upon careful planning both of theinterrogation itself, and of the premises wherein it is conducted. It calls for a psychological attack. Apart from legal and moral considerations,torture and physical cruelty of all kinds are professionally unrewarding since a suspect so treated may be persuaded to talk, but not to tell the truth.Successful interrogation may be a lengthy process.3. Any detainee therefore must be properly handled and treated from themoment of his arrest and adequate facilities provided for his interrogation.Aim4. The aim of this Directive is to-(o) establish rules for the conduct of interrogation by military personnel.(b) set out the requirements for successful interrogation.Treatment of Detainees5. Broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detentionduring civil disturbances are laid down in Article 3 of The Geneva Con-vention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949). military personnel will follow these principles when conducting interrogation. these principles are (a) Persons taking no active part in hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely without any adverse distinction founded on race,colour, religion or faith, sex, birth, wealth or any other similarcriteria.(p) The following acts are prohibited (i) Violence to life and person, in particular mutilation, crueltreatment and torture;/(ii) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating anddegrading treatment.
6. Under conditions of emergency, or near emergency, there is likely tobe internal security legislation controlling the treatment of detainees andarrested persons. Legislation will vary from country to country and reflectprevailing conditions. Military personnel are to acquaint themselves withthe laws of the country concerned, and will not act unlawfully under any circumstances whatever.Application to Interrogation8. To obtain successful results from interrogation, the actual and instinc-tive resistance of the person concerned to interrogation must be overcome by permissible techniques. This will be more easily achieved by sustainedinterrogation in an atmosphere of rigid discipline. It may therefore be, necessary for interrogation to be carried out continuously for long periodsboth by day and by night with consequent disruption of the normal routineof living.9. Where practicable, all persons detained in the Interrogation Centreshould be seen daily by a Medical Officer and asked if they have any com-plaints ; any allegations of cruelty or torture should be reported at once tothe appropriate superior medical headquarters or senior responsible civil or military authority. Medical examinations should be mandatory onadmission and discharge (including temporary transfers to or from a detention-tion or other holding centre) and medical treatment available as required.The Medical Officer is to maintain a record of each person&apos;s weight as recorded on admission and discharge.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office at St. Stephen&apos;s Parliamentary Press322784 Dd 141748 K    2/72
