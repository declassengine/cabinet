EXCHANGES WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MALTA CONCERNINGREVISION OF THE 1964 AGREEMENTS ON MUTUALDEFENCE AND ASSISTANCEINTRODUCTIONOn 29 December 1971 the Government announced that they were settingin hand preparations for the withdrawal of British forces and their dependants from Malta. The Government took this decision with reluctancebut it was made necessary by the impossibility, shown by the attachedsummary of the course of discussions with the Malta Government, of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations for a new agreementgoverning the future use of the defence facilities in Malta.2. Under the defence and financial agreements concluded in 1964, theBritish Government had undertaken to provide the Malta Government witheconomic aid totalling  51 million over 10 years, of which  40-4 millionhad been paid over by the time of the general election in Malta in June1971 (and a further instalment of  1-2 million was paid to Mr. MintofPsGovernment on 13 July 1971). During this period, the economy of Maltacontinued to derive substantial additional benefit from the presence ofBritish forces; and Malta&apos;s gross national product at current prices rose from  53-3 million to  98-3 million (by the end of 1970).3. On his election, Mr. Mintoff made it clear that he wanted animmediate and complete revision of these arrangements. His view of the relationship between the two countries was that British forces in Maltaserved purely British purposes and that the British Government should enterinto a new agreement to pay &quot; rent&quot; in advance at a level which reflected the Malta Government^ assessment of the island&apos;s economic needs. Hedefined the level of &quot;rent&quot; at  30 million per annum for a wholly&quot; exclusive &quot; arrangement (Le. one in which the Malta Government would beprepared to exclude forces of non-NATO countries) and  20 million perannum for an arrangement under which Britain would have to accept use by other countries except those hostile to NATO. The  20 million was later reduced to  18 million.4. Throughout the negotiations, the British Government maintained that they would not seek to keep British forces in Malta against the wishes of the Malta Government. Nevertheless, there has been a long and historicassociation between the British armed services and Malta; and the BritishGovernment made special efforts to find a satisfactory basis for continuingthat association. In the light of the changing strategic situation, thelevel of British forces in Malta was in the course of recent years reducedto an infantry unit and reconnaissance aircraft, together with port, airfield,communications and logistic support facilities and their supporting serviceand civilian staff. Although the defence facilities there could not be described as essential for the defence of Britain, the British forces stationed in 1 Malta provided part of our contribution to the defence of
NATO&apos;s southern flank. The task before the British Government wastherefore to seek a balance between, on the one hand, the requirements ofthe Malta Government as expressed by Mr. Mintoff; and, on the other, thevalue which they and their NATO Allies placed on Malta&apos;s defence facilities.5. Britain alone could not carry the whole financial burden of any new agreement; and the British Government consulted NATO fully at all stages.They maintain their belief that the offer they conveyed on behalf of NATOof a basic annual figure at a level closely approaching  10 million wasfair and indeed generous. Moreover, the Maltese economy would have continued to benefit from the local expenditure of the British forces(recently running at the rate of about  13 million per annum); and some of britain&apos;s NATO Allies offered to contribute a substantial additional amountof bilateral economic support (support totalling  7 million spread over aperiod had already been offered when the negotiations broke down).6. After an understanding had been reached at discussions between thetwo Prime Ministers at Chequers in September, the British Government made,an advance payment of  4-75 million related to the six months from30 September; and a series of talks about a new agreement began at official level in Malta. By the end of November the two sides were still far aparton various important matters of substance. In December, it proved impossible during exchanges with the Malta Government to agree upon the timing and basis of renewed discussions. On 25 December, the BritishGovernment received a demand for a payment of an additional 4-25 million for the next quarter, or the withdrawal of British forces by 1 January 1972. A further message on 29 December repeated this demand. The British Government were not prepared to make this furtherpayment and were obliged to conclude that the British military presencewas no longer acceptable to the Malta Government. Accordingly they decided to order withdrawal.BACKGROUND7. Under the Agreement on Mutual Defence and Assistance (Cmnd. 3110),concluded for a period of 10 years from Malta&apos;s attainment of independence in September 1964 the Malta and United Kingdom Governments undertook to afford each other assistance for mutual defence. The British Governmentwas given the right to station armed forces and associated British personnel in Malta in peace and in war, and to use facilities there for the purposesof mutual defence, the fulfilment of international or Commonwealth obliga-tions, the assistance of other nations in maintaining their independence and stability, or the protection of the citizens of the United Kingdom and Coloniesor of Malta. Except under arrangements between the two Governments,no forces other than the forces of Malta and the United Kingdom couldbe stationed in Malta or permitted to use harbour, dockyard, airfield, stagingor communication facilities in Malta. The Agreement provided, as an exception to this, that the Government of Malta might accord rights and facilities to the forces of any party to the North Atlantic Treaty, consistent with the exercise of United Kingdom rights.3
8. In January 1967 the Malta Government alleged that the BritishGovernment had failed to consult them adequately over the rundown plans for British forces in Malta and that this was a contravention&apos; of Article of the Defence Agreement. The British Government did not accept this and informed the Malta Government that they were not entitled to treat theDefence Agreement as at an end on the ground of the alleged contravention ofArticle 6 or on any other ground! Although the Malta Government did notthereafter acknowledge formally that the Defence Agreement remained inforce, in practice they continued to accord British forces in Malta thefacilities provided for by the Agreement and to act in a manner consistent with its provisions. The British Government for their part have&apos; consistently7maintained their view that the Defence Agreement remains in force.9. Under the Agreement on Financial Assistance (Cmnd. 3111) whichwas concluded at the same time as the Defence Agreement the British Govern-ment undertook to make available to the Government of Malta a sum notexceeding  50 million over the 10-year period from 1 April 1964 for thediversification and development of the economy of Malta, and a further sumnot exceeding  1 million for the restoration of historic buildings and works.Of the  50 million a sum not exceeding  18-8 million was \o be madeavailable&quot; during the first three years and a sum not exceeding  31-2 million was to be made available during the following seven years. The obligationto make available the  31-2 million and the further  1 million was contingentupon the continued operation of the Defence Agreement. The present,as well as the previous, Malta Government accepted payments of aid madeunder the Financial Assistance Agreement.10. In March 1968, in connection with the settlement of the MaltaDockyard problem, whereby the Dockyard was brought into public ownershipin Malta, the British Government agreed to allocate for the Dockyard 3 million of the  51 million made available under the Financial AssistanceAgreement and to provide an additional  3 million of aid for development projects between 1 April 1974 (the end of the period covered by the FinancialAssistance Agreement) and 31 March 1976.11. Article 5 of the Financial Assistance Agreement provided that theassistance to be made available in the first five years, up to 31 March 1969,should be as to 75 per cent by way of gift and as to 25 per cent by wayof interest-bearing loans. The division between gifts and loans for theremaining five years was left to be the subject of future discussion. &quot; TheBritish Government agreed in October 1970 tha.\ out&apos;of the  23 million stillavailable under the 1964 Agreement,  4 million for historic buildings andthe Dockyard would be made available by way of gift, as well as 75 per cent(approximately  14-25 million) of the balance. The other 25 per cent(approximately  4-75 million) would be by way of loan. By September1971,  41-6 million of the total  51 million had been disbursed, leaving 9-4 million outstanding for the period up to 31 March 1974, and in addition 3 million under the Dockyard settlement ayailable in the following two years. &apos; r12. The direct payment of aid, however, represents only a part of the contribution which the presence of British forces can make to the economy of Malta.   The stationing of some 2,750 Servicemen, together with their4
families, in Malta provided direct employment for about 5,000 Maltesecivilians (even after the reduction so far effected under the rundownprogramme) and, indirectly, provided work for a further 1,400. The british forces also employed some 1,100 Maltese uniformed personnel. British local defence expenditure, including personal spending, in Malta for 1971-72would have been about  13 million.EXCHANGES FOLLOWING THE MALTESE GENERALELECTION OF 197113. The result of the general election held in Malta on 12-14 june was a victory for the Malta Labour Party led by Mr. Dom Mintbff. the malta Labour Party&apos;s manifesto contained the following statement on theDefence Agreement:&quot; The Defence Treaty will be reviewed and it must be made clearthat the funds coming from the British Government are not charity butas payment for the facilities Malta is according to Britain.Payment has to be adequate for the needs of our country and Britaincannot automatically pass on these facilities to other Powers.It will also be ascertained that the Defence Treaty will protect betterthe jobs of Service Department employees, and that those sacked willhave to be adequately compensated and alternative employment found for them.&quot;14. Immediately after being sworn in as Prime Minister on 17 June,Mr. Mintoff had an oral message conveyed to the British High Commissioner,Sir Duncan Watson, to the effect that the new Malta Government, inaccordance with their mandate, wanted immediate and complete revisionof the Defence and Financial Assistance Agreements, with interim ad hocarrangements until the revision had been completed. The BritishGovernment were invited to make proposals and to send a representative to conduct negotiations.15. After the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,had invited him to state more precisely what changes he would like to seeintroduced into the Agreements, Mr. Mintoff sent the following message on25 June:&quot; Your High Commissioner has delivered to me the message yousent me yesterday evening.On the clear understanding that the United Kingdom Governmenthave accepted in principle the urgency of a renegotiation of the 1964Defence Agreement (already denounced by my predecessor in 1967)and of the Financial Agreement, j have endeavoured to set out belowsome indication of the new aspects to be taken into account during the talks.v The British Government must fully recognise that the presence ofBritish forces in Malta and their use of the facilities made available tothem is, from a military point of view, solely in the interests of Britain.On the other hand, the Maltese people expect to derive economic5
benefits from any arrangements that will be made, which would be related to their economic needs. The use of Malta by Britain for military purposes can only be tolerated in so far as it helps Malta to achieveeconomic viability in the shortest possible time.The 1964 Agreements must, therefore, be replaced by a singledocument embodying the facilities to be made available to your forces and the quid pro quo which the Maltese Government expect in return.Definite undertakings, apart from a rental to be paid in advance, will cover the level of military expenditure in Malta, and the number,conditions of employment, terminal benefits and eventual reintegrationinto civilian life of Maltese employees.The facilities to be offered by the Maltese Government will be strictlydefined; the use of such facilities will be limited exclusively to Britain,and the activities of British forces will be determined accordingly.It is my earnest hope that a new relationship, acceptable to both sides,will be established. This will improve the relations between the twocountries.With good will on both sides such an agreement could be negotiatedwithin a short time, say one month. If your Government feels this tobe unrealistic, ad hoc arrangements incorporating the principles I have indicated would have to be made in order to enable me to provide yourforces with the continued use of facilities in Malta.&quot;16. Sir Duncan Watson returned to London for consultations on30 June. The same evening, the Malta Government issued a statement(Correspondence Annex, Item 1) claiming that the Defence Agreement wasno longer in being. The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, Mr. Godber, stated in the House of Commons on 1 July:&quot;... No official communication in these terms hase been received bythe British Government, who consider that both the Defence Agreement,and consequently the Financial Assistance Agreement which is dependenton it, have always remained legally in force and still do so. The onlyofficial communication from the Malta Government with which we haveto deal is the Prime Minister of Malta&apos;s proposal for revision ofthe Agreements. The House will be aware that only on 25 June a joint statement was issued by our two Governments announcing that the BritishGovernment had received that proposal, that contacts had started, andthat our High Commissioner in Valletta would be returning to Londonthis week for consultations.  He returned to London last night.&quot;17. . In a further exchange of messages with Sir Alec Douglas-Home who made it clear that the British Government would not seek to maintain forcesin Malta against the Malta Governments wishes, Mr. Mintoff objected tothe proposed stationing in Malta of 41 Commando Group as well as to anyother addition to, or replacement of, the existing British forces in Malta.He pressed for a British Minister to be sent without delay to negotiate anew agreement and he threatened otherwise to terminate British facilities.The Prime Minister then sent a letter to Mr. Mintoff, dated 7 July, whichwas delivered by Sir Duncan Watson on 8 July.  It read as follows:6
&quot; My colleagues and I have been discussing with Sir Duncan Watsonthe various messages which you have sent us since you came into office.I am bound to tell you, with the frankness with which I hope oneCommonwealth Prime Minister may address another, that we have been considerably surprised to put it no more strongly that you have found it necessary to adopt so hasty and abrupt an approach to matters whichare of considerable concern to both our Governments. I do not recallhaving received such peremptory messages from another Head ofGovernment; and I should be doing less than justice to the feeling whichthey have provoked within my Government if I did not make it clear to you that we regard it as impossible to do business on this basis. I say this because I am sure that if it should ever regrettably become necessary to state publicly the exchanges between our Governments,public opinion would fail to understand why we had not said it.Our own position, as you know, is that we regard the Defence andFinancial Agreements as valid and in force. We understand that youtake a different view. Without prejudice to our position we are readyto discuss with you to see if a basis can be found for the negotiation ofnew arrangements provided this can be done in a reasonable and orderly manner. A British Minister will be ready to visit Malta for this purpose as soon as the necessary preparatory work has been done. But there willbe little advantage in such a visit unless the ground has been properlyprepared in advance; and I am therefore asking our High commissioner to clarify with you the indications of your own intentions which you have so far given us and to seek to establish in greater detail the points whicha Minister will have to be prepared to discuss with you. For example,you have referred to the need for our facilities in Malta to be &apos; strictlydefined&apos;. We shall be interested to know with greater precision what this means. You have suggested that the activities of our forces shouldbe &quot; determined accordingly&quot;. Here again, we should need to knowwhether limitations on their existing scale of activities are implied bythis phrase and, if so, what limitations you have in mind. You havesuggested that we should henceforward pay &apos; compensation&apos; for our useof facilities in Malta.  What orders of magnitude have you in mind?Moreover, you will appreciate that we are concerned not merelywith our own position in Malta but with the interests of NATO also,since our dispositions in Malta are directed primarily to the purposes ofthe defence of Western Europe. If you envisage some curtailment ofthe availability of facilities for this purpose we must clearly know precisely what this means. Equally, we shall naturally be concerned toestablish that any fresh Agreement between us would not provideopportunities for the use of facilities in Malta by others in ways whichwould be incompatible with the purposes for which we use them.This may suffice to indicate /the broad areas where we should welcome clarification of your intentions in order that our Minister maybe fully briefed before he visits Malta. Let me repeat that he will comewith goodwill and a genuine desire and intention of examining with you whether agreement can be reached, if we may be assured that you for your part are prepared to reciprocate in the same spirit. bearing that mind the long association between our two countries and the historic7
part which Malta has played in the defence of Western Europeancivilisation, I profoundly hope that we may be able to establish our future relations on a basis of mutual trust and confidence.Meanwhile we maintain that the Defence and Financial agreements are still in force. Nevertheless we are prepared, in deference to yourwishes, but without prejudice to our rights under the Defence Agreement,to suspend further troop movements; but you will be aware that therelief of the Devon and Dorsets will not increase the level of our military dispositions and you will also understand that, if we have to announcepublicly the suspension of the relief arrangements as our logistic time-table will compel us to do not later than noon tomorrow, 8 July, we shallhave to make it clear that this suspension is at your direct request.As regards the Financial Agreement, we are ready to transfer thecurrent instalment of aid forthwith unless you, for your part, would prefer not to receive it.I hope you can agree to proceed as I suggest; this can be done with reasonable expedition.&quot;18. Subsequently, the instalment of  1-2 million grant aid in respect ofthe quarter ending 30 September 1971, was paid to the Malta Government,under the Financial Assistance Agreement, on 13 July. Following the suspension, at the Malta Governmenfs request, of the replacement ofthe 1st Battalion the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment by 41 CommandoGroup, the advance party of the latter was instructed to return to theUnited Kingdom.19. Mr. Mintoff, in his reply of 8 July, did not give the clarification of his proposals which had been sought. The Prime Minister nevertheless,in a further message of 12 July, stated his readiness, without prejudice tothe British Governmenfs position on the Agreements, for the Secretary ofState for Defence to visit Malta on 14 July for exploratory discussions.Mr. Mintoff insisted that Lord Carrington should be empowered to negotiate a new agreement on the basis of the Malta Governmenfs proposals; butthe British Government were not prepared to accept such a precondition.Lord Carrington&apos;s visit on 14 July was therefore called off whenhe was on the point of departure. Sir Alec Douglas-Home made a state-ment in the House of Commons on 15 July, explaining that the BritishGovernment remained ready to enter into negotiation at Ministerial level,in good faith and without preconditions, with a view to reaching anagreement satisfactory to both sides. Eventually, through messages, thePrime Minister established that both parties would come to the table withgoodwill and without prejudice to their respective views and proposed afresh date of 19 July for Lord Carrington&apos;s visit to Malta. Mr. Mintoffwelcomed this.VISIT OF LORD CARRINGTON TO MALTA, 19-21 JULY20. During his meetings with Lord Carrington, Mr. Mintoff indicated thathe wished the United Kingdom to pay  30 million a year for the use ofdefence facilities: for this price, the Malta Government would be preparedto exclude the forces of any non-NATO country.  For  20 million a year,8
the United Kingdom would obtain arrangements under which the malta government would be free to allow certain non-NATO countries, but notthose hostile to NATO, to use facilities in the island, including the harbour and the airfield at Luqa. Under either arrangement, the United kingdom would have to be satisfied with fewer facilities in more concentrated areas and on more restricted conditions of use.21. At the same time, the Minister of State for Defence, Lord Balniel,held discussions with representatives of the Malta Government, during whichhe explained what the United Kingdom would require under any new agree-ment and sought clarification of what the Malta Government had in mind.The Malta representatives provided, as an indication of what their government had in mind, an informal first draft of a possible agreement.This contained several important alterations and omissions as comparedwith the 1964 Agreement. It made no provision for the exclusion ofunfriendly forces from the island; it excluded British use of the defence facilities in Malta for the purpose of carrying out her general international obligations, and it made no provision for the use of the facilities by Britain&apos;sNATO Allies. In addition, it restricted the facilities hitherto enjoyed byBritish forces. Unspecified restrictions were proposed on the movementof weapons, explosives and ammunition, and air traffic control arrangements at Luqa could be taken over by the Malta Government without prior consulation. Several other clauses on the pay and conditions of service of maltese uniformed personnel and civilians, and on the surrender andre-instatement of fixed assets, would have resulted in substantial increases in United Kingdom costs on the island.22. Before leaving Malta Lord Carrington informed Mr. Mintoff that theBritish Government would find it difficult to enter into any arrangement under which they paid more for less in return, particularly at a price on thescale he had indicated. Lord Carrington undertook, however, to report theposition to his colleagues. The British Government would need to consulttheir NATO Allies but would reply to the Malta Government as soon aspossible.CONSULTATIONS IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL23. From the time when the new Malta Government made known theirwish for a revision of the Defence and Financial Assistance Agreements withthe United Kingdom, the British Government kept the North Atlantic Councilinformed of their communications with the Malta Government and exchangedviews with their Allies on the political and strategic considerations. NATOalso became directly involved in communications with the Malta Governmentin relation to its headquarters and other facilities in Malta. These derivedfrom the informal arrangements which existed prior to Malta&apos;s independence and which (as permitted under the Defence Agreement with the UnitedKingdom) were confirmed after Independence in an Exchange of Notesbetween NATO and the then Malta Government in September 1964 andMay 1965. Further discussions resulted in the adoption on 3 November 1965of the Joint Statement whereby the North Atlantic Council affirmed:the agreement of its members that consultations should take place between NATO and the Government of Malta, whenever, in the opinionof the Government of Malta, or of any of the members, the territorial9
integrity, political independence, or security of Malta is threatened, aswell as their willingness to discuss all matters which may concern the relationship between NATO and Malta, including that of the establish-ment of further arrangements with Malta.&quot;The arrangements for NATO facilities in Malta, however, remained on an informal basis.24. As a result of the NATO authorities&apos; communications with the newMalta Government the following communique&quot; was issued in Brussels on13 August:&quot; The Government of Malta has made known to the North atlantic council that it desires to alter the existing relationship between malta and NATO.After consultation with the Government of Malta, NATO has repliedthat it will respect the wishes of the Government of Malta. The defence planning Committee has given instructions to the NATO militaryauthorities to start the necessary preparations for the transfer of NATO&apos;activities elsewhere.As soon as a decision has been taken by the Defence planning committee concerning the future location of these activities, a furtherannouncement will be made.&quot;25. So far as concerned the Malta Governmenfs proposals for a new defence agreement with the United Kingdom, the British government recognised that their NATO Allies had an interest in the continued denial of Malta to a potential enemy, and in the use of facilities in Malta tosupport NATO&apos;s southern flank. It was therefore appropriate to seek terms which included a sufficient range of facilities; conditions for their use whichwould enable NATO&apos;s interests to be met; undertakings acceptable to the alliance about the denial of facilities to a potential enemy; and financialpayments which reflected the value that NATO, rather than the UnitedKingdom alone, placed on a satisfactory defence arrangement with Malta.In the light of these considerations, the British Government, after LordCarrington&apos;s visit to Malta, initiated active consultations in the north atlantic Council on the response that should be made to the malta government. In particular they sought the views of the other member countries of the Alliance on the financial contributions they would beprepared to make in order to preserve the interests of the Alliance in Malta.BRITISH GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS26. Following these consultations, the British Governmenfs response tothe Malta Governmenfs proposals for a new defence agreement was communicated to Mr. Mintoff by Sir Duncan Watson on 11 August, in thefollowing terms:.    . .&quot; The British Government have now considered the proposals put toLord Carrington, during his visit to Malta last month, about the basis for a new agreement on the use of defence facilities in the Island. Theyhave also carried out the consultations with their Allies, to which LordCarrington referred in his message of 5 August [this interim messagenot printed].10
The British Government wish to reach an agreement whereby theirarmed forces stationed in, or visiting, Malta will continue to contribute,as at present, to the interests of Western security. Subject to detailednegotiation between the two Governments, the British government propose that the main features of such an arrangement should be asfollows:(i) British forces and associated personnel will continue to use thedefence facilities required to enable them to meet the defence requirements of the British Government.(ii) The use of the defence facilities made available to Britain willbe subject to arrangements to be agreed between the twoGovernments for the sharing of such facilities with the forces ofother governments allied to the United Kingdom.(iii) The use of other facilities in Malta by the forces of othergovernments will be subject to agreement between the Malta andBritish Governments.(iv) The other conditions governing the use by British forces andassociated personnel of the defence facilities, and the employmentof Maltese personnel at such facilities, will be broadly similarto those which exist at present.If an arrangement on the lines indicated above is acceptable to the malta Government, the British Government, with the co-operation oftheir Allies, would propose the following in respect of a period of years to be determined:(i) The British Government would arrange for an annual budgetarypayment of  5 million.(ii) In addition to their contribution to the annual payment under(i) above, the British Government would, subject to detailednegotiation of the terms, make an annual contribution of 3  million to assist the economic development of Malta.In addition, a number of Britain&apos;s Allies have indicated a readinessin principle to make contributions towards the economic development of malta; the amounts and terms would be agreed bilaterally between the malta Government and the governments concerned.The proposals by Britain and her Allies which are summarised above would, over a comparable period of time, total in terms of budgetaryand other assistance not less than  38 million, as against the aidpayments of  12-4 million which have been due between now and march 1976 under the 1964 and 1968 Agreements. This would be inaddition to the benefit to the Malta economy of the direct expenditure,at present running at  13 million per annum, resulting from the presenceof British forces.The British Government hope tiiat the Malta Government will agreethat the above proposals afford the basis for detailed discussions on theprovisions of a new agreement.&quot;27. In delivering this message, Sir Duncan Watson added, on instructions, that the British Government understood, through Mr. Kastl,the Acting Secretary-General of NATO (who had visited Malta on 6 and11
7 August), that the Malta Government faced a shortage of cash to meet their current expenditure. However, the British Government, inconsultation with their Allies, would be prepared in principle to consider urgently a formal request for an advance of a portion of the annualbudgetary payment referred to in their proposals, on the understanding thatthe Malta Government accepted the proposals of the British government as the basis for negotiating a new defence arrangement. If, in the event,no arrangement proved possible, the advance would have to be repaid.28. Mr. Mintoff told Sir Duncan Watson that without an unconditionaloffer of a bridging advance, he was not prepared to consider the BritishGovernmenfs proposals. If the British Government genuinely wanted timeto negotiate, this would have to be paid for. On 13 August, the PrimeMinister was sent a message from the Maltese Cabinet (CorrespondenceAnnex, Item 2). It contained an ultimatum on the termination of &quot;theexisting military arrangements&quot; unless the Malta Governmenfs proposals were accepted as the basis for detailed negotiations, and an advanceunconditional payment of  2 million was received, by the evening of18 August. A similar message was also delivered to the Acting Secretary-General of NATO.29. After further consultation in the North Atlantic Council, thePrime Minister replied by reminding Mr. Mintoff of the way in which theBritish Government, in concert with their Allies, would be willing. toconsider making immediate interim financial arrangements with the malta government. He repeated that the British Government would not seek to keep British forces in Malta against the wishes of the Malta Government,but expressed the hope that the difficulties could still be resolved, and offered to ask Lord Carrington to visit Malta at once. Mr. Mintoff acceptedthe offer of a further visit by Lord Carrington. Mr. Kastl, however, was informed on 18 August that the Malta Government still desired NATOto start taking immediate steps to dismantle all their facilities in Malta,and to cease flying NATO flags on the NATO Headquarters. Mr. Kastlconfirmed that these steps were under way; and it was announced on20 August that the activities of the Headquarters would be relocated inNaples. The removal of the Headquarters from Malta was finallycompleted on 26 November.SECOND VISIT OF LORD CARRINGTON, 19-21 AUGUST30. Mr. Mintoff, in his discussions with Lord Carrington on 20 August,confirmed that he would be prepared, in a new agreement, to giveundertakings in respect of denial of Maltese facilities to Powers hostile to NATO. He also stated his readiness in principle to agree to &quot;visitingfacilities &quot; for individual NATO countries.31. As to finance, Mr. Mintoff did not insist on a cash advance. Butthe differences remained very wide. Mr. Mintoff insisted on  18 million annually from NATO, and he pressed strongly for the British Governmentto increase their own contribution and to urge other NATO countries to increase theirs. Lord Carrington, in reply, explained the direct and indirect benefits to Malta, of the financial proposals which the British12
Government had already put forward. Whilst this offer might conceivably be increased to something approaching  10 million annually, Lord Carringtonmade clear that there was no prospect of attaining anything like  18 million.But he undertook to clarify the financial position in NATO as quickly aspossible.CONFIRMATION OF THE ALLIED PROPOSALS32. The British Government gave the North Atlantic Council a full account of Lord Carrington&apos;s discussions with Mr. Mintoff and undertookthe necessary consultations in NATO in order to clarify the financialposition. Lord Balniel in Lord Carrington&apos;s absence sent Mr. Mintoffa reply on 1 September, confirming that the basic position remained as lord Carrington had explained during his visit and that the BritishGovernment wished to continue discussions.33. Mr. Mintoff thereupon sent another ultimatum to the Prime Ministerat midnight on 2/3 September (Correspondence Annex, Item 3). He statedthat the Malta Government would begin a &quot; series of actions &quot; unless, bythe evening of 7 September, there had been an intervention by the PrimeMinister which radically changed the situation. The Prime Minister, inhis reply of 7 September (Correspondence Annex, Item 4), confirmed thatthe NATO offer still held good and that its basic figure had been raised from  8J million to a level closely approaching  10 million, through the readiness of Britain and other members to make further contributions;any bilateral economic development contributions from britain&apos;s Allies wouldbe additional to this. Mr. Heath suggested that as he could not himself visitMalta at that time, either Lord Carrington should do so again or mr. Mintoff should visit London.RESTRICTIONS ON THE BRITISH FORCES34. In response to a telephone enquiry on behalf of Mr. Mintoff, SirDuncan Watson indicated British readiness to consider quickly, in consulta-tion with their Allies, any proposal by Mr. Mintoff for him to embark on direct talks with interested NATO Governments on bilateral aid, concurrently with further discussions with the British Government on the possible basisof a new defence arrangement. But at midnight on 7/8 September, Mr.Mintoff sent the Prime Minister a further message in which he statedthat without the means of quantifying the entire NATO offer, including the bilateral economic contributions, he could not judge whether it justifiedfurther discussions with the British Government. Mr. Mintoff addedthat it was no longer in the Maltese interest to continue to negotiate froma position of weakness, and he indicated that restrictions were being imposed on the British Forces. A simultaneous announcement was made by the malta Government that stalemate ha,d been reached in the negotiations,and that as a first step duty-free fuel was to be withheld from &quot;foreignforces &quot;.35. On 9 September Sir Duncan Watson delivered a formal protestto the Malta Government against the imposition of sanctions upon theBritish Forces, in breach of the 1964 Defence Agreement, and requested13
their immediate removal. The British Government decided that there shouldbe no uptake of fuel by the British Forces that entailed paying duty to the malta Government.36. After consultation in NATO, a further Note was delivered toMr. Mintoff on 13 September (Correspondence Annex, Item 5), which namedthose Allied countries which had indicated their readiness in principle toenter into bilateral discussions with the Malta Government on economic development contributions; proposed that detailed Anglo/Maltese discussions on the terms of a new defence arrangement should be started withoutdelay; and stated the British Government^ assumption .that the measures against the British forces would now be cancelled and that no further measures of a similar nature would be taken.THE CHEQUERS UNDERSTANDING37. The next day Mr. Mintoff suggested that he might take up the invitation from the Prime Minister to come to London, with a view to afinal effort to reach a settlement. A renewed invitation was extended,which Mr. Mintoff accepted on 16 September. Mr. Mintoff stayed at chequers on the night of 17/18 September and had discussions with thePrime Minister and Lord Carrington.38. The two Prime Ministers discussed a six month interim arrangement,under which Britain would continue to enjoy facilities in Malta withoutrestrictions; the Malta Government would receive a payment on the basisof the existing NATO offer; economic support from other NATO countries would be negotiated bilaterally, with a view to reaching agreement inprinciple on the financial aspects of a new defence arrangement within three months; and a complete new agreement would be negotiated in detail with the British Government within six months. These proposals were set down in an informal memorandum of understanding. After Mr. Heathhad confirmed that the proposals were fully acceptable to Britain&apos;s Allies,the understanding was made public on 22 September in the following agreedterms:&quot;1. The aim would be to reach agreement in principle on thefinancial aspects of a new defence arrangement within a period of threemonths; and to negotiate a complete detailed agreement with a periodof six months.2. The Government of Malta would enter into bilateral discussions with those members of the North Atlantic Alliance who indicate their readiness in principle to negotiate bilateral economic support agreements.The Government of Malta attach particular importance to any suchbilateral agreements being quantified on an annual basis as soon aspossible.3. The Government of Malta and the British Government would enter immediately into detailed discussions of the modalities of a new defence arrangement. These discussions would take place primarily inValletta at the official level. Ministers would participate as necessary from time to time. ......14
4. Pending the introduction of a new agreement, there would be norestrictions placed on British forces in Malta and the previous arrange-ments would be restored.5. The British Government would arrange to pay to the malta government as soon as practical arrangements could be made, 50 percent of the annual level of payments offered in the latest package.Payment would be for a six months period with effect from30 September next. There would be no further payment by the BritishGovernment under present arrangements.&quot;It was made clear in London that this understanding, and especiallyMr. MintofPs assurance concerning the removal of restrictions on the british forces, had created a most favourable atmosphere for the further detailednegotiation of a new defence arrangement.39. The supply of duty-free fuel to the British forces was restored, andsubsequently, in October, the replacement of the 1st Battalion the Devonshireand Dorset Regiment by 41 Commando Group, which had been suspendedat the Malta Governmenfs request in July, was carried out. On30 September the British Government made payments to the malta government representing 50 per cent of the annual level of payments( 9  million) in the NATO cash offer. These consisted of a payment of 3 million on behalf of Britain and certain of her Allies, and a payment of If million out of British aid funds.DETAILED DEFENCE NEGOTIATIONS40. In accordance with the Chequers understanding, a first round oftalks at official level was held in Valletta on 27 and 28 September, with the aim of identifying, and providing for further work on, the main issues arising under the defence aspects of a new agreement. The British negotiatingteam was led by Mr. Peter England, Assistant Under-Secretary of State(Defence Staff), and the Maltese team by Mr. Alfred Wirth (AdministrativeSecretary of the Malta Government). Further talks were held in Vallettafrom 13 to 15 October and from 17 to 19 November. Some progress wasmade, but the talks revealed substantial differences between the requirementsof the two sides. Apart from the basic financial issue, there were many points still to be resolved concerning the nature and conditions of the defence facilities themselves.41. In the second round of talks in October, the Maltese team declined to discuss the requirement for Britahfs Allies to have the right to shareBritish facilities in Malta until the bilateral discussions with certain NATOcountries had made up the total of  18 million per annum for a new defence agreement. In the third round in November, the Maltese team stated that,since there was no sign of the other NATO countries bridging that financialgap, discussions could only continue oh the basis of an agreement limited toBritish use of Maltese facilities, and at a price substantially higher than 10 million per annum. They expressed Mr. Mintoffs interest in an earlyfurther visit by Lord Carrington. The British team reserved their position on the Maltese proposal for a &quot; non-sharing agreement&quot;, pending consulta-tion in NATO.  They stated that Lord Carrington would be ready to pay15
another visit to Malta if both Governments felt that a personal meeting withMr. Mintoff would be of value; but in order to prevent any misunderstanding,they made clear that Lord Carrington would not be able to hold out any hope of an increase in the  9J million NATO offer. There was, however,the additional economic support on offer by certain NATO countries. Thisamounted altogether to about  7 million (not on an annual basis).ATTEMPTS TO ARRANGE FURTHER MINISTERIAL DISCUSSION42. Between 25 November and 22 December there was a series ofwritten exchanges with the Malta Government concerning a further visit byLord Carrington. The British Government offered such a visit as soon as was convenient to both sides, and repeatedly made clear that it would takeplace on the same basis as before: that is to say, without preconditions, andin a genuine endeavour to see whether agreement could be reached; thiswould allow full discussion of the points both sides wished to raise. the malta Government, however, wanted their proposal for a non-sharingagreement, at a price substantially higher than  10 million per annum, tobe taken as the only basis for further discussions. On 4 December, SirDuncan Watson offered specifically that Lord Carrington should go to Maltafor talks on 16 December. The Malta Government did not take this up, buton the evening of 16 December they suggested a visit by Lord Carringtonbetween 20 and 24 December, on condition that their proposal should bethe first item on the agenda. The British Government made no difficultyover this procedural point; and since Lord Carrington&apos;s programme preventedhim from visiting Malta on the dates suggested, they offered 30-31 Decemberor 3-4 January instead. On the night of 20-21 December Mr. Mintoffinsisted that his proposal should be discussed that same week. After furtherexchanges on 22 December had led to a repetition of this, Lord Carringtonsent Mr. Mintoff a message on 24 December recapitulating the position asthe British Government saw it, and renewing once again his offer to visitMalta on 30-31 December or 3-4 January (Correspondence Annex, Item 6).Mr. MINTOFFS ULTIMATUM43. About midnight on 24/25 December Mr. Mintoff sent LordCarrington the following message:&quot; In your message of December 24, 1971, you assume you have giventhe Maltese Government enough assurances to make them accept the dates which you have set for talks on items which you still refuse to( specify.It is therefore right and proper for me to remind you of the time limit which was jointly set out at Chequers on September 18, 1971, namely&apos;The aim would be to reach agreement in principle on the financial aspects of a new defence arrangement within a period of three months&apos;.Taken literally, that time limit expired on December 18, 1971, butin order to avoid the accusation of a too narrow interpretation, the maltese Government were willing and ready to extend this time limit tothe end of the year.16
They were, however, exasperated by your insistence to stretch theirpatience to the very latest possible hour without giving the slightesthope of your readiness to move from the position your side registeredat Chequers a position which the Maltese delegation quite as clearlyconsidered and declared to be unacceptable.Indeed, my colleagues and I have declared at Chequers that theminimum rent for the defence facilities in Malta was  18 million perannum.Nothing since then has changed the attitude and views of the maltese government. The bilateral talks which you suggested we should have with your Allies were a hoax. Your latest move to start talks again on the very day the extended time limit expires is merely an attemptto gain time on the cheap.The Maltese Government do not want to refuse out of pique anyrequest by you for talks. They, however, feel that this time theycannot allow you to negotiate any more from a position of strength.You cannot, therefore, expect your forces to remain on the Islandbeyond December 31, 1971, unless you accept the legitimate demand of,the Maltese Government for an adequate rent.In other words, talks on the modalities of any defence arrangements can only be resumed if your Government are ready to pay the differencebetween the  18 million per annum laid down by the Maltese Governmentand the  9 - 5 million per annum which you, supported by the combinedresources of your Allies, have so far shown willingness to pay.More specifically, should you wish to retain your forces on the island during the remaining three months allotted at Chequers for thefinalisation of a complete detailed agreement, a sum of no less than 4-25 million must reach the Maltese Government before December 31,1971.&quot;44. On 28 December the following reply from Lord Carrington was delivered in Valletta:&quot;In your message of 25 December you state that you are notprepared to have further talks nor to allow British forces to remain in malta beyond 31 December unless the United Kingdom makes animmediate further payment of  4-25 million.The terms of the Chequers Understanding make it clear that, pending a new agreement, there would be no restrictions placed on British forcesin Malta and that the payment of  4-75 million related to a six-month period from 30 September. We are not therefore prepared to make afurther payment as you now require. While you insist on your freshdemands there is no prospect of concluding a new defence agreement.If you are willing to withdraw your latest demands, I am stillprepared to come to Malta for talks on Dec 30-31 or Jan 3-4, in a genuine attempt to seek a basis for a new agreement.If you are not prepared to talk on this basis, we shall not seek tokeep our forces on the Island against the wishes of the Malta Government.A team would be sent out to discuss the arrangements for withdrawal,which we would start to put into operation without delay.&quot;17
In delivering this reply, Sir Duncan Watson informed Mr. Wirth that inview of the far-reaching nature of Mr. MintofPs ultimatum, and of thePress interest aroused by his Christmas Day speech to the Maltese people,the British Government would issue a statement to the Press explaining that the Malta Government^ demands were unacceptable, unless they heard by the following morning that the ultimatum had been withdrawn.45. On 29 December the following message to the Prime Minister fromMr. Mintoff was delivered:&quot;I refer first to the oral part of the message delivered by yourHigh Commissioner to our Administrative Secretary in which the BritishGovernment is reported to threaten to call the British Press in the morning of December 29, 1971, if the Maltese Government does notwithdraw the message of December 24 by 10 a.m. Malta time ofDecember 29.My answer to this ludicrous ultimatum is the willingness of the maltese Government to publish forthwith all the documents and minutesconnected with the negotiations since the Maltese Labour government took office in June of the year. Not only do we have nothing to hidefrom our people, from your people and from the outside world, butwe would be most eager to give this matter as wide a publicity aspossible.I now come to the written message from Lord Carrington datedTuesday, 28 December 1971. Lord Carrington speaks of a fresh demand by the Maltese Government and seems to imply a breach of the termsof the Chequers Understanding on our part.The Chequers Understanding gives a time limit of three months foran agreement to be reached &apos; in principle on the financial aspects of anew defence agreement&apos;. It was clear in the Chequers Understandingthat if the financial quantum were not agreed by the end of three months,the Chequers Understanding would no longer be binding. Indeed in no part of the Chequers Understanding was it stated that the  4-75 million were a final payment for the six months period from 30 September 1971to 30 March 1972. They were merely a part payment based on theassumption that by December 18 1971 at the latest, a new sum wouldhave been negotiated to replace this temporary figure.The Maltese Government therefore do not understand what LordCarrington means when he refers to - fresh demands&apos;. Lord Carringtonis intelligent enough to know that even according to the ChequersUnderstanding British forces remain stationed in Malta after December 18only on tolerance. The payment of  4-25 million required by the maltese Government for these forces to remain here beyond January 11972 is not a fresh demand but the arithmetical difference between the rent of  18 million expected as yearly rent by the Maltese Governmentand the  9-75 million which Britain, out of her own resources andthose of her Allies, was willing to pay for the military base in Malta.Should Britain not be prepared to pay this amount for the nextquarter, namely January-March. 1972, the Maltese Government expectall British armed personnel and their dependants to be outside the six-mile limit of Maltese territorial waters on New Year&apos;s Day.  We are18
not interested in having long discussions with teams about arrangementsfor withdrawal. The British Government were aware of the consequences of dilly dallying and should have made the necessary preparations.&quot;After considering this message, the British Government issued a statementconcerning the exchanges with the Malta Government since the Chequersmeeting, and announcing that in the circumstances they were setting in handpreparations for the withdrawal of British forces from Malta (CorrespondenceAnnex, Item 7).46. The following reply was sent by Mr. Heath to Mr. Mintoff on thesame day:&quot; Sir D. Watson has transmitted to me your message of 29 December.Lord Carrington explained in his message of 28 December how wefor our part were prepared to continue to talk in a genuine attempt to seek a basis for a new agreement. That remains our position. But, ashe also stated, we will not of course seek to keep our forces on the island against the wishes of the Malta Government. In the light ofyour latest message we shall undertake preparations for withdrawalstraight away.I cannot accept g your interpretation of the period covered by theChequers Understanding. As Lord Carrington stated in his latestmessage, the Chequers Understanding made it clear that the payment of 4-75 million related to a six-month period from 30 September 1971.But the process of withdrawal will in any event require some time.&quot;19
CORRESPONDENCE annex.   STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE MALTA GOVERNMENT ON30 JUNE&quot; Contrary to what has appeared recently in the foreign Press concerningthe 1964 Defence Agreement, this Agreement is no longer in being. It hadbeen denounced by the Maltese Nationalist Government in 1967 during therundown dispute and had only been replaced by verbal arrangements. these arrangements may, according to international law, be terminated by a simplenotice. Therefore the question of an unilateral abrogation of a treaty by the maltese Government does not arise.The Labour Government was recently returned to power on the strengthof an electoral programme which clearly outlined its foreign policy. Theposition of British forces in Malta must now be governed by fresh arrange-ments which will safeguard Malta&apos;s sovereignty and ensure a secure and higherliving standard for the Maltese people.No action has been taken by the Maltese Government to which it is not entitled under international law and for which it has no clear mandate.The Maltese Government could have even ordered the withdrawal of all british forces from Malta. It has preferred not to do so, so that britain could be given an opportunity for new arrangements to be properly discussed and finalised. The British Government, after having reluctantly accepted tohold talks, are now trying to play for time. For reasons best known to britain, the British High Commissioner has gone back on his promise anddelayed his consultations with his Government by 24 hours. In themeantime the British Press had undertaken a campaign to browbeat theGovernment of Malta into submission.The position of NATO is even weaker than that of the British forces.All NATO have is a provisional and limited permission which should have led to some form of arrangements that were never concluded. The great interest shown now by NATO in its relations with Malta is not under-stood by the Maltese Government. NATO in the past refused Maltamembership or associate status and was not even prepared to consideran observer status. It is also useful to clarify the position of the Americanfleet. There was no treaty or agreement between the Government of malta and the United States Government giving the American Sixth Fleet the rightto take shelter in Maltese harbours. A request by the American Ambassadorfor units of this Fleet to enter Malta was submitted to the maltese government on 9 June 1971. The Maltese Government does not consider such visits to be in the interest of Malta for the time being. The state department has not asked for any further explanations and is not entitledto any.This Statement is being issued to make the main facts known to theforeign Press, in particular to the British and Italian Press, to whom biasedinformation was purposely leaked to bring pressure upon the maltese government.A copy of this Statement is being submitted to the Office of the security council of the United Nations.&quot;20
2. MESSAGE FROM THE MALTESE CABINET TO THE PRIMEMINISTER, DELIVERED THOUGH SIR DUNCAN WATSON ON13 AUGUST&quot;As a result of Mr. Kastl&apos;s visit to Malta the Maltese Governmentpostponed the date of the closing down of NATO Headquarters and made asuggestion for interim financial arrangements.These arrangements, if accepted, would have enabled Britain and her allies to avoid any disruption of defensive operations and to continue to enjoy the use of their military facilities in Malta whilst negotiations withthe Government of Malta were in progress. This conciliatory gestureon the part of Malta was misinterpreted by Britain as a sign of weakness.Indeed, it was reciprocated, apparently with the full backing of the nato Council, by an attempt to make the provision of interim financeconditional on the acceptance of vague and incomprehensible British counter-proposals. Both this condition and the British counter-proposals have beenflatly turned down by the Maltese Government. The Maltese original proposals are by contrast most business-like in their simplicity and shouldhave provided the basis for a new agreement beneficial to Malta, to Malta&apos;sArab neighbours and to Europe. They were explained at length both to aBritish Cabinet Minister and to the Acting Secretary-General of NATO.After many weeks of waiting the Maltese Government feel it is now time to test whether there is a genuine desire on the part of Britain and her NATOAllies to reach agreement. If therefore the proposals submitted by the maltese government are not accepted by Britain as the basis for detailed negotiations and an advance unconditional payment of  2 million is not received fromthe British Government by Wednesday, 18 August 1971, 2200 hours GMT,the military arrangements now prevailing will automatically come to an end.The Government of Malta will also inform the Security Council of the united nations that the British and NATO bases in Malta have been terminatedand any further operation of British or NATO forces on Maltese soil willbe considered as an act of aggression.&quot;3. MESSAGE FROM Mr. MTNTOFF TO THE PRIME MINISTER,DELIVERED THROUGH SIR DUNCAN WATSON ATMIDNIGHT ON 2/3 SEPTEMBER&quot;On 18 August 1971, after getting the confirmation of a willingnesson your part to bridge the wide gap between our respective positions, Ifell in with your suggestion to send Lord Carrington to Malta.Lord Carrington came to Malta on Thursday 19 August 1971. The gist of his proposal to us was the possibility of your agreeing to raise the combined sum of  8-5 million mentioned in your message of 11 August1971, to  10 million, all of it in the form of rent. This global sum wasseparate from and over and above any sums which might accrue to Maltafrom the ^undisclosed annual contributions which an undisclosed numberof British Allies &apos; have indicated a readiness in principle to make towardsthe economic development of Malta&apos;.21
After making sure that our new conditions governing the defence facilities and their extent would be acceptable to your Government, wereacted to Lord Carrington&apos;s proposal by making the following counter-proposal :(a) The Maltese Government were prepared to cut down the originalfinancial request to an absolute minimum of  18 million per annum.(b) Once more the Maltese Government were prepared to give Britaintheir consent to negotiate with the undisclosed number of her Alliesthe equivalent of the economic contributions into an ascertainablesum which, together with Britain&apos;s own payment, would enable theBritish Government to guarantee to Malta a rent of  18 million perannum.Lord Carrington seemed optimistic, and the discussions ended on a friendlynote. Indeed the atmosphere was so genial as to induce me to offer toLord Carrington &apos; all the support I can muster if you ever need myintervention in your negotiations with your Allies&apos;.On 25 August 1971, I expressed my consternation at reports reachingme from your Allies alleging my concurrence with your desire to prolongthis simple exercise of consultation for at least two weeks.On 26 August 1971, the Malta negotiations seemed to have lost someof their former glamour. My message was not answered by LordCarrington or by your good self. It was instead tackled by a raw juniorMinister who gave me assurances which events proved to be utterlyworthless.On 1 September 1971 I again received another message from LordBalniel which is not only worthless but also meaningless. For instance,if &apos; the basic position remains as Lord Carrington explained to you during his visit&apos; what sense can one see in the offer &apos; we for our part wouldlike to continue discussions with you &apos;?My colleagues and I met today to review the whole situation. Wecould only find two plausible interpretations for the sudden deteriorationleading to the present impasse.The first and the most likely is Britain&apos;s conscious attempt to play a doublegame: whilst making her Allies believe in her sincere efforts to reach a workable agreement with the Maltese Government, Britain-in fact wouldlike nothing better than to be rid once and for all of the responsibility of keeping an impoverished Malta within the Western orbit. this interpretation is lent much force by:(a) The British campaign in Parliament and in the Press denigratingMalta&apos;s defence facilities.(6) Britain&apos;s insistence with her Allies that &apos; we know best how todeal with the Maltese&apos;, meaning of course that the Maltese are abunch of cowards who would come whimpering back to you forcharity immediately you call their bluff and face them with the realityof the departure of your precious forces.22
(c) The Way your representatives have double-crossed us in the lastconsultations with your Allies: we know for a certainty that insteadof showing a willingness to increase the British contribution towardsthe total rent for the Malta fortress as you led us to believe byconsenting to bridge the gap between us your representatives toldyour NATO partners of Britain&apos;s decision not to pay a penny more.Our other interpretation, which frankly I find most unlikely, is that you were so preoccupied with other matters as to have left the Malta problem in the hands of lesser men.As you well know we have other options open to us and any of these is a greater and more lasting value to our people. You have, however,recently led your people and ours to believe that agreement was in sight,and we feel it is our duty to show the world how erroneous was this impression, and also whose responsibility it was for the final breakdown of the negotiations which started as long ago as 17 June 1971. Weare therefore giving you notice of our intentions so that in the briefintervening period you could if you find Malta&apos;s defence facilities, of sufficient import to Britain visit the island and give evidence of yourgood faith in wanting to bridge the gap between our existing positions.At 2300 hours on Tuesday, 7 September 1971 unless there is anintervention on your part which radically changes the situation the maltese government will begin a series of actions which will clearly convey to you and to all your Allies how unacceptable is &apos; the basic position&apos; explained to us by Lord Carrington on your behalf during his last visit.&quot;4.  MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO Mr. MINTOFF,DELIVERED IN VALLETTA ON 7 SEPTEMBER&quot;I have received and given careful thought to your message of2 September. I feel bound at the start to record that there are certainimputations in it which I cannot accept. I have throughout taken the closestpersonal interest in the problem which confronts us. Every substantivecommunication you have received from us, whether at Ministerial level or through the British High Commissioner acting on instructions, has had the collective authority of Her Majesty&apos;s Government behind it.You referred in your message to the fact that your discussions with lord Carrington during his visit to Malta on 20 August ended on a friendlynote. I am glad to say this because I know that this was his own belief:and it makes clear that we do not take the view of Malta and the Maltese people that you attribute to us. But for all the friendliness of the talks,it is a fact that the gap between us remained very wide at the end of those discussions. Lord Carrington made it clear that we could not join you inurging our Allies to pay more. , He explained that in our consideredjudgment the NATO offer was a generous one and, moreover, one which you could have every confidence would be honoured once arrangementssatisfactory to all concerned could be agreed.In the first paragraph of your message you referred to confirmation of a willingness on my part to bridge the wide gap between our respectivepositions.   Later in your message you said that, by consenting to bridge23
the gap between us, we had led you to believe that we were willing toincrease the British contribution. The actual words I used in my message of 17 August were as follows:&apos; The gap which divides us is wide and, as you know, the BritishGovernment will not seek to keep British Forces in Malta against thewishes of the Malta Government. But I should regret it deeply if, asa result of a failure to bridge the gap, we were now faced with theprospect of the long historic association between the British Services and malta being brought to an end.&apos;.Nothing which Lord Carrington said during his subsequent visit could possibly be construed as an undertaking to raise the financial terms ofthe NATO offer. He particularly emphasised that he saw no way in whichthe figure of  18 million per annum, or anything approaching it, couldbe achieved. He also made clear that the figure of  13-6 million perannum which you mentioned during the discussion as your understanding ofthe latest position achieved by NATO in no way corresponded to the fact as we understood them.It might at this point be helpful if I were to restate the terms of the nato offer quoting from the communication which Sir Duncan Watsondelivered to you on 11 August:&apos; I. The British Government would arrange for an annual budgetarypayment of  5 million.II. In addition, to their contribution to. tiie annual payment underI. above, the British Government would, subject to detailed negotiation of the terms, make an annual contribution of  3-1- million to assist theeconomic development of Malta.In addition, a number of Britain&apos;s Allies have indicated a readinessin principle to make contributions towards the economic developmentof Malta: the amounts and. terms would be agreed bilaterally betweenthe Malta Government arid the Governments concerned.&apos;During his ensuing visit, Lord Carrington indicated that there might be apossibility of the basic figure of  8-5 million, made up as shown above,being increased by some additional cash contributions which would bring it nearer the figure of  10 million. However, as you yourself recognised in your message, he could give no firm undertaking to that effect. LordCarrington also explained that it would be difficult to give precision to anyfigures for the contributions to economic development mentioned in the nato proposal (other than the British  34 million) until the Governmentsconcerned had been able to enter into detailed discussions with the malta government.Thereafter, as Lord Carrington had undertaken, we consulted our Alliesagain: and Lord BalniePs message of 1 September confirmed that theposition remained basically as Lord Carrington had stated to you.Since receiving your latest message we have again been in tduch with burAllies.The offer as Lord Carrington stated it still holds good. I can corifirriithat the basic figure has been raised to a level closely approaching 10 million.   In order to make this possible Her Majesty&apos;s Government24
and other members of NATO have indicated their readiness to make further contributions. Additional to this figure would be any contributions to continue development that may be negotiated bilaterally between Britain&apos;sAllies and the Malta Government.We for our part remain willing to discuss further with you the possible basis of a new Defence arrangement. I am myself unable to visit Malta atthis time. But as you already know Lord Carrington, who will be returning to this country in a few days&apos; time, could do so again if you wished.Alternatively, my invitation to you to visit London if you so wish naturallyremains open.&quot;5. NOTE FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGH commissioner to THE PRIME MINISTER OF MALTA, DELIVERED ON13 SEPTEMBER&quot;I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom have carried out further consultations with their&quot; fellow members of the North Atlantic Alliance in the light of the message which you addressed to my Prime Minister on 7 September. Ihave now been instructed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to communicate thefollowing.The Governments of Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and norway have all indicated their readiness in principle to enter into bilateral discussions with the Malta Government on contributions to Malta&apos;s economic development, and other Allied Governments are still considering the matter.Her Majesty&apos;s Government also understand from the Government of Francethat the Government of Malta have already been informed of their positionoh this question.Her Majesty&apos;s Government for their part repeat their readiness inprinciple to negotiate with the Government of Malta the terms of a new defence arrangement. They propose that detailed discussions to this end should be started without delay.In my note of 9 September I conveyed to Your Excellency, on instructions,the protest of Her Majesty&apos;s Government against the measures referred toin your message of 7 September. Her Majesty&apos;s Government assume thatin the light of the information given&apos;above these measures will now be cancelled and that no further measures of a similar nature will be taken.&quot;6.  MESSAGE  FROM LORD CARRINGTON TO Mr. MINTOFF,&apos;    DELIVERED IN VALLETTA ON 24 DECEMBER&quot;We received the text of Mrv Wirth&apos;s letter of 22 December toSir Duncan Watson yesterday. I have now been able to discuss the position with the Prime Minister, who has just returned from his visit to NorthernIreland, as well as the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.2. I think it might be helpful if I were personally to recapitulate theposition as we see it, and to comment on some of the points which ariseout of&apos; Mr. Wirth&apos;s letter.25
3. When we proposed on 4 December that I might visit Malta again on 16 December we made it clear that I had in mind talks taking place without preconditions and in a genuine endeavour to see whether agreement could be reached. It follows, as was stated in a later communication, that both sides should be free to raise the points they wished and that it wouldbe open to the Government of Malta to put forward their suggestions andin whatever order they desired. I would be perfectly ready to follow yourwishes about the order of discussion in any further talks between us. Ifyou wish I am ready to come on either of the alternative dates already suggested namely 30-31 December or 3-4 January.4. In his letter Mr. Wirth referred to the discussions at Chequers inSeptember. The relevant part of the Memorandum of Understandingagreed at Chequers reads as follows:&apos; 1. The aim would be to reach agreement in principle on thefinancial aspects of a new defence arrangement within a period of threemonths: and to negotiate a complete detailed agreement within a periodof six months.2. The Government of Malta would enter into bilateral discussions with those members of the North Atlantic Alliance who indicate their readiness in principle to negotiate bilateral economic supportagreements. (To the extent appropriate the British Government would use their good offices to that end.) The Government of Malta attachparticular importance to any such bilateral agreements being quantifiedon an annual basis as soon as possible.&apos;5. Immediately thereafter we were in touch with our Allies on thequestion of bilateral economic support. Subsequently there were discussions between the Malta Government and some of the allied Governments in thecourse of which substantial offers were made. In the meantime we madethe payment of  4-75 million on the basis agreed at Chequers. I cannot accept that the British Government have failed to observe either the letteror the spirit of the Memorandum of Understanding, or that there is anylack of good faith on our part.&quot;7.  STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE FOREIGN and commonwealth OFFICE ON 29 DECEMBER&quot;1: In accordance with the terms of the Chequers Understanding of18 September, the sum of  4-75 million was paid to the Malta Governmenton 30 September, and a team of British officials made three visits to malta to discuss details of a possible new defence agreement. Some progress was made but talks revealed substantial differences between the requirementsof the two sides. In addition, a number of our NATO Allies entered intobilateral discussions with the Malta Government and between them madeoffers of further economic assistance totalling  7 million spread over aperiod.2. The Malta Government rejected the offers from NATO countries asinadequate. No more progress could therefore be made in the officialtalks.  On 19 November Lord Carrington offered to pay a further visit to26
Malta and on 4 December he repeated his offer proposing a date of16-17 December for talks without preconditions. This offer to talk withoutpreconditions was not taken up.3. After a series of further exchanges, Mr. Mintoff sent a message on24 December, received here early on Christmas morning, rejecting LordCarrington&apos;s offer to go to Malta on 30-31 December or 3-4 January and stating that he was not willing to allow British forces to remain in Maltabeyond 31 December unless an immediate further payment of  4-25 million was made to the Malta Government.4. The terms of the Chequers Understanding make it clear that the agreed payment of  4-75 million related to a six-month period from30 September and that, pending a new agreement, there would be norestrictions placed on British forces in Malta. The British Government arenot prepared to make the further payment demanded.5.
