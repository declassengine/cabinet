POLICY GUIDANCE TO THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITYMemorandum by the Minister  or trade the Civil Aviation Act 1971 provides for the establishment of a CivilAviation Authority to undertake the economic and safety regulation ofcivil aviation and to provide,  jointly with the Secretary of- Statefor Defence, air navigation services.    The Authority came formallyinto being on 22 December 1971 and is due to assume its fullfunctions on 1 April 1972.2       Section 3 of the Act sets out the main objectives which theAuthority should pursue and provides that the Secretary of State may give further guidance to it about the way in which it should performits functions.    The intention is that this guidance should amplifythe objectives by setting out the policies to be pursued by theAuthority in particular areas.    Section 3 further provides that the guidance must be approved&apos; by affirmative resolution of both houses of Parliament before being given.3      Because of the impossibility of drafting policy guidance in language that would pass the Select Committee on statutory instruments, the Act does not provide for the guidance to be tabledas a Statutory Instrument.    Instead it should issue as a White Paper.If sufficient time is to be allowed for Parliament to debate this in both Houses before 1 April, it should if possible be tabled no later than about 17 February.    In view of these special reasons for the guidance being in White Paper form and of the short time scale fortabling it, I seek the concurrence of my colleagues to its not being submitted to the Cabinet&apos; for further discussion,,    I intend to tableat the same time the various regulations for which the Act provides,and a new Air Navigation Order, which are all subject to negative resolution.    I propose to publish with the White Paper, forinformation, the text of the direction to the National Air TrafficService which the Secretary of State is making jointly with theSecretary of State for Defence and which is not subject to anyParliamentary procedure.
4       The Act requires the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryto consult the Civil Aviation Authority before giving the guidance and this has been done.    The present text takes account of itscomments and the Chairman designate is content.    The Air TransportLicensing Board, the Air Registration Board, the industry and theGovernment Departments concerned have also been consulted and, so faras possible, account has been taken of the comments received.5       The White Paper will not be subject to line by line amendmentbut must be approved or disapproved as a whole.   I am confident thatthe draft annexed to this paper will be broadly acceptable toGovernment supporters.   It might be possible to restrict the debateto half a day in each House.6       The draft White Paper which I annex sets out the proposedguidance in paragraphs 7-30.    The politically sensitive passages arethose dealing with air transport licences, particularly paragraphs15-18 which deal specifically with the relationship between the air corporations (referred to as the British Airways Board airlines) andthe second force airlines ,(British Caledonian Airways).    these paragraphs embody the assurances contained in the statement which i made on 3 August 1970, so far as these have not already been implemented by the transfer of routes from the Corporations to thesecond force.7       For the rest, the guidance places emphasis on the importanceof the consumer, on the merits of competition and the desirabilityof going for the necessary minimum of detailed control, carrying .forward the philosophy of the Edwards Report.   It stresses the need to look at the place of British civil aviation as a whole in theworld market, and to maximise its profitable share.    Domesticallyit requires the Authority to look at the role of air services in the context of regional development and overall transport policy, andthe need to plan the matching development of aerodromes.   Paragraph24 makes it clear that, in regulating travel organisers, theAuthority should not set out to deal with complaints about unfinishedhotels and cancelled cruises.8       The financial objective in paragraph 29 will require a very substantial increase in the rate of recovery of costs from theindustry and users of its services over a five year period.Paragraph 21 provides, in this connection, for a two year period during which the Authority is to make proposals for dealing withthe intractable problem of financing air services, aerodromes and navigation services in the Scottish Highlands and Islands.9       I seek the Committee&apos;s agreement to the annexed draft, to betabled, without further discussion, as a White Paper on 17 Februaryfor approval on a motion by both Houses of Parliament before1 April 1972.M A C NDepartment of Trade and IndustryLondon SW14 February 19722
annex draft WHITE PAPERCIVIL AVIATION POLICY GUIDANCEINTRODUCTIONThe Civil Aviation Act 1971 provides for the creation ofa Civil Aviation Authority charged, with the regulation ofairlines and organisers of air travel, the control of the safety of civil flying generally, the operation jointly* with the Secretary of state for Defence of air navigationservices, advising on the provision of aerodromes and themanagement oi&apos; certain aerodromes in Scotland.   The Authoritycame into being on 22 December 1971 and will assume itsprincipal functions on 1 April 1,972.2.     Section 3(1) of the Act sets out the broad objectives of Government policy for the -British civil air transport industry, which it will be the Authority&apos;a duty to pursue.These objectives are:-(s) to secure that British airlines provide air transport services which satisfy all substantial categories ofpublic demand (so far as British airlines may reasonably be expected to provide such services) at the lowestcharges consistent with a high standard of safety in operating the services and an economic return toefficient operators on the sums invested in providing the services and with securing the sound development *of the civil air transport industry of the UnitedKingdom; /(b) to secure that at least one major British airline whiclnis not controlled by the British Airways Board hasopportunities to participate in providing, on charter and other terms, the air transport services mentionedin the preceding paragraph j(c) subject to the preceding paragraphs, to encourage the.civil air transport industry of the United Kingdom toincrease- the contribution which it makes towards afavourable balance of payments for the UnitedKingdom and towards the prosperity of the economy of the United Kingdom j and &apos;id) subject to the preceding paragraphs, to further the reasonable interests of users of air transport services;&apos;
3.     Section 3(2) of the Act provides for the Secretary ofdtate to give guidance to the Authority, so as to amplifyand supplement these four objectives in more detail and soas to cover also the Authority&apos;s functions in other areas;he may vary this guidance from time to time.    It will bethe authority&apos;s duty to fellow this guidance when it hasbeen approved by affirmative vote of both Houses ofParliament.4.     In framing the guidance it has been the Governmentsaim to leave the Authority a wide measure of discretion.The;/ have therefore expressed the guidance in general termsrather than as a comprehensive set of detailed instructions.It will be for the Authority to work out the detail and -apply it in   particular cases.    In any case that come3 tohim on appeal the Secretary of State will have regard to the objectives and the guidance and will uphold the Authority&apos;decision unless there is clearly a substantial reason fordeparting from it.5.     Civil aviation is and will continue to be closelyregulated throughout the world.   This is necessary in orderto&apos; secure^sfandards of safety and public amenity, to ensurethat public transport services are dependable and becauseinternational services (which account for by far the greaterpart of British airlines&apos; activity) largely depend on the  .consent of other countries or on agreements for the exchangeof traffic rights.    These considerations must necess-rilylimit the United Kingdom&apos;s freedom of action in practice andthe guidance must be read against the background of these limitations.    The Authority and the Department of Trade andIndustry will need to work closely together in these matters.6.     The remaining paragraphs of this White Paper set out the guidance which the Secretary&apos;of State, after consultationwith the Authority and the industry, now submits for-   for information,approval.   The appendix sets out/the terms of the directionthat the Secretary of State has given to the Authority under
Section 28(2) of the Act, concerning the provision of air navigation services.THE GUIDANCEGENERAL7.     Civil air transport exists hy serving the public;   theAuthority should inform itself of the public !.s needs and take full account of them.   The Authority, acting within the framework of the objectives and of this guidance and withinthe limitations affecting international services, should aimalways to impose the least restraint upon the industry* orupon the users of its services.   Arrangements which restraincompetition or innovation should be accepted only so far asthey contribute to the realisation of the objectives and thisguidance.   Although it will be much concerned with airlines,the Authority should keep in mind the needs of generalaviation including flying schools and clubs.8,     The Authority should aim to secure a high standard of aviation safety.   It should seek to ensure that this high standard is achieved in the contruction, maintenance and operation of aircraft and in the use of aerodromes.   In so doing it should give effect to safety requirementsderiving from international agreements, in particular theChicago Convention and the Annexes thereto.   It should alsoensure, where necessary, that timely preventive and remedial measures are taken and should promote the development ofnew equipment and techniques.*   In this guidance references to &quot;British airlines&quot; are tobe taken as referring to holders of air transport licences and references to &quot;the industry&quot; are to be taken asreferring to holders of air transport, air travel organisersand aerodrome licences.SAFETY- 3 -CONFIDENTIAL
9.     In providing air traffic and navigationservices the  Authority     Should have due regard to theinterests of both military and civil users, includinggeneral aviation interests, so as to make safe,efficient and economical use of the limited air spacethat io available.AIR TRANSPORT LICENSING10.     The Authority should seek to maximise the opportunities for the industry profitably to increase its share of theworld civil air transport market.    It should encourage theprovision by British airlines of services that will foster the development of the United Kingdom&apos;s trade and tourismand strengthen the balance of payments.11.     The Authority should seek to ensure that the scale and character of the operations of British airlines are within their skills and resources.    In granting air transportlicences and in regulating or advising on the levels of charges, the Authority should also seek to ensure so fsr aspossible that efficient British airlines in both the public and private sectors have the opportunity to operate profitablyso as to justify the rate of capital expenditure necessaryfor the maintenance and development of their services.12.     In allocating air transport licences the authority should also consider the suitability of particular airlinesto engage in particular types of operations and the pattern of routes and operations which will bring the greatestbenefit in terms of the objectives.&apos; ..;    , ...... ^13.     The Authority should not reserve any particular typeof operation exclusively to public or private enterprisesby reason of their being publicly or privately owned orimpose any particular balance as between public and privateAIR NAVIGATION SERVICES
CONFIDENTIALjtorpriges.   It 1b in general desirable that more than oneit Inn airline should onga^;e, or be available to engage, in eachype oi operation even though the entry of additional airlinesinto particular types of operations may sometimes need to be carefully controlled in order to avoid undue fragmentation of effort.   Subject to paragraph 15 below, airlines should be giventhe opportunity of allocating their resources flexibly as between one type of service and another in line with the development ofthe market.14.     The Authority should further the maintenance and developmentof a viable network of scheduled services so far as may benecessary, and reasonable in the context of Section 3(1)(a) ofthe Act, to provide for individual passengers wishing to buy seatsdirectly from the airlines or their agents at the public fare.Restrictions on the wholesaling of seats through air travelorganisers, on any type of servicev should be kept to the minimum necessary to ensure that such provision is made and that efficientBritish airlines have the opportunity to operate profitably.15.     The British Airways Board airlines should remain theprincipal providers of scheduled services.   British CaledonianAirways, the airline to which Section 3(1)(b) of the Act shouldbe applied, should continue to be the principal independentscheduled airline.   The Authority should seek to ensure thatthese airlines have adequate opportunities to compete effectively in the world civil air transport market.    For this reason it will need in general to limit, at least for some years to come, thegrant to other British independent airlines of licences to serveadditional international scheduled routes.16.     Subject to paragraphs 11 and 12 above and to the limitations imposed by the United Kingdom&apos;s international relations the Authority should license more than one Britishairline to serve the Game scheduled service route or trafficpoints wherever it is satisfied thata.     the traffic is likely to be sufficient to supportcompeting services profitably within a reasonable time,b*    the choice and standard of services available tothe public are likely to be improved and, in the oase ofan international route, either
c. the aggregate share of total traffic that is secured by the British airlines is likely to be increasedto an extent that will more than offset any lastingdiseconomies, ord. where the British share of capacity- is predetermined,the licensing of a second British airline, within thatshare is likely to increase the total traffic secured by British airlines more rapidly than would otherwise be likely.17.     The Authority should bear in mind the need to giveBritish Caledonian Airways adequate opportunities to developits route network particularly during this airline&apos;sformative years.   The Authority should therefore givepreference to British Caledonian Airways when licensing anadditional British airline to serve an existing scheduledservice route.    The Authority should also give BritishCaledonian Airways a measure of preference over otherairlines in allocating licences for new scheduled serviceroutes, and for non-scheduled services where the number orcapacity of British airlines need for the time being to be restricted,   The Authority should however&apos; in every case take account also of the considerations in oaragraphs 10, 11 and12 above and the effect of its decisions on the developmentof other airlines;    it is not the Governmenfs intention that any preference should be automatic or complete.18.     In order to further the rationalisation of routenetworks the Authority should, when circumstances warrant,examine with the British Airways Board and the other british airlines concerned whether routes should be adjustedor reallocated among them;   but routes should be transferredbetween airlines only where this would be likely to promote the objectives and the policies in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12above.19,     The Authority should encourage mergers that will, injits judgment, strenthen.the industry in pursuit of the objectives without unduly impairing competition.   The-   ft   wCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAuthority should inform itself of commercial and poolingagreements in order to judge how far they are consistent withthe objectives as a basis both for its own decisions and forits advice to the Secretary of State.20     In regulating domestic air services, the Authority shouldhave regard to their place in the total internal transport system.   It should take account of the contribution which bothinternational and domestic air services may make to regional economic and social development in the United Kingdom and shouldhave regard to the particular interests of the Channel islands and the Isle of Man when regulating air services to or among them.    The Authority should advise the Secretary of State andothers concerned as to the provision and development of aero-dromes to match the development of air services and generalaviation.21     The Authority should in particular examine, with the air-lines and other bodies concerned, the economics and organisationof air services, and of its aerodromes and air navigation services in the Scottish Highlands and Islands and make recommendations-to the Secretary of State if possible by 31 March 1974.    Untilthat time the Authority, in seeking fuller recovery of its costs in this area, should be careful to avoid prejudice to thecontinued operation of those air services which are essentialto the region&apos;s economic and social development.PRICING22     To the extent that the charges for air transport or forholidays by air need to be controlled, either because of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s international relations or for the reasonstated in paragraphs 11 and 14 above the Authority   should seek to secure tariff provisions and associated conditions thatare rational, simple and enforceable.   As a guiding principle for the longer term, each charge should be related to costs ata level which will yield sufficient revenue to cover the costs of efficient operators, including an adequate return on capital.This does not for example preclude the cross-subsidisation ofnew services which are being developed or differential pricingthat reflects differences in the cost of producing particular
CONFIDENTIALfacilities or which, is designed to reduce wide fluctuations in demand; but the Authority should keep pricing structures underreview so as to promote the sound allocation of resources.The Authority should have regard to the need to restrainincreases in charges for domestic air services that would adversely affect the prosperity of the United Kingdom economy.INTERNATIONAL MATTERS23     The Authority should maintain a close working relationship with the Department of Trade and Industry in all matters concerning relations with countries and territories outsidethe United Kingdom, the United Kingdom&apos;s membership of inter-national organisations and the implementation of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s international obligations.    In particular it should provide advice and should make staff available to attend inter-national discussions.    The Authority should make its expertassistance available to foreign governments and others where&apos;this would promote British interests including the export ofBritish aviation products.AIR TRAVEL ORGANISERS24-     The Authority&apos;s powers under the regulations made underSection 26 of the Act are designed to ensure that only thosewho act within the rules and who have adequate resources   or financial arrangements shall engage in the organising, andwholesaling of air travel.    The Authority should not use these powers to regulate competition among travel organisers.    TheAuthority&apos;s concern with standards of service should be confined to the operation of air services, whether or not these form part of a holiday arrangement.ENVIRONMENT25     The Authority will need to take full account of government policies on   the control of aircraft noise and the safeguarding of the environment and to advise the Government on these matters.It should assist the industry to meet and adapt to such requirements as may become necessary and should also assist theGovernment to implement them.- 8 -
INFORMATION26.     Subject to Sections 36 and 61 of the Act theAuthority should publish promptly and at suitably frequent intervals statistical and other information about theindustry and enterprises within it including information relating to safety matters.    It should make the records ofits public hearings readily available for inspection.RESEARCH27,     The Authority should support an adequate programmeof research and development on matters within itsresponsibility, in particular air safety and airworthiness,air traffic control and navigation services and air transporteconomics, co-ordinating its activities with Government   ,Departments and other bodies engaged in these fields.CONSULTATION28.     The Authority should maintain and develop appropriateconsultative arrangements over the whole range of its functions.FINANCIAL29.     The Authority should perform its functions efficiently and economically.   Its financial objective should be to recover,as soon as possible the whole of its costs, and, a return on capital reasonable in relation to the nature of its activities and prevailing commercial standards, from those, includingGovernment Departments, who use or&apos;-benefit from its services.Until the Authority breaks even the Government will pay toit a grant-in-aidv sufficient to meet its expected, deficit on revenue account.    This grant will be assessed annually inadvance.   The,aim of the Government will be to reduce thegrant progressively and the Authority should formulate its- 9 -
financial piano with a view to dispensing with it by1977/78.   The Government recognise however that theAuthority cannot it3elf fix charges for navigation servicesand that in the case of en route charges the need to reachinternational agreement may delay the achievement of this aim in this particular area of activity.   Nonetheless theAuthority should from time to time make proposals to theSecretary of State for achieving its financial objective in this area.   The Government also recognise that, until a conclusion is reached on the matters referred to inparagraph 21 above, the Authority will be unable to makesignificant progress towards the recovery of its costs inrelation to the Scottish Highlands and Islands.4 February 1972

The Authority shall join with the Secretary of State for defence in relation to the matters specified in section 28(2)(a) and (b) ofthe Act in the manner specified in the following paragraphs.3.     The Authority shall collaborate with the Secretary of State for defence in exercising its functions in providing air navigationservices through a joint organisation known as the National air traffic Services (hereinafter referred to as &quot;that&quot;).    The functionsexercised jointly through that shall include those services whichhave hitherto been provided through that jointly by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry and the Secretary of State.for Defence.that shall be manned jointly by civilian staff of the Authority andby personnel of the Services and civilian staff to be made available by the Secretary of State for Defence, and shall make use of civil and military facilities and installations as appropriate.   The senior officer of that shall be known as the Controller, his Deputy as the deputy Controller, and the officer in charge of operations in thefield as the Joint Field Commander.4.     The services provided through that shall be available to allclasses of civil and military aircraft both within the UK nationalairspace and within any airspace for which the UK has in pursuanceof international arrangements undertaken to provide such services(hereinafter referred to as &quot;the UK ATC airspace&quot;).5.     The services provided through that shall be planned, provided and operated in such a way as to secure safe separation of aircraftwhilst facilitating, consistently with flight safety and havingregard to costs, the most expeditious flow, the greatest possiblefreedom and the optimum utilisation of aircraft required by operatinginterests.
