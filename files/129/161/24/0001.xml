THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 24 COPY NO29 February 1972CABINETTHE POST-APOLLO programme memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. The studies proposed by the Secre ary of State for Trade andIndvistry in his memorandum CP(72) 23 are the prelude to further commitments which we shall be invited to agree to at meetings of theEuropean Space Conference beginning in May.    Since it will in reality bemuch more difficult to withdraw later if we join in studies now, we need to be clear what the Post-Apollo programme is, and what participationwould involve for the United Kingdom,,WHAT IS POST-APOLLO?2. The programme is still largely undefined, but seems likely tohave the following main elements:a. The Space Shuttle:  A large aeroplane (&quot;manned orbiter&quot;)perched on a big locket.    The aeroplane, and possibly the rocket,would be re-usable.b. The Orbital Systems: Miscellaneous hardware (&quot;research and Applications Modules&quot; and &quot;sortie cans&quot;) to be placed in earthorbit by the Shuttle.c. The Space Tug: A self-propelled (presumably manned)space vehicle to shunt bits of the &quot;Orbital System&quot; eg. - betweenearth orbit and geostationary orbit.3. The funds approved so far by the President of the United Statescover a. only.    Europe&apos;s most likely contribution would be the whole ofc. ( 280 million) with possibly bits if a, and b. as well.    It has beenclaimed for Post-Apollo that it will reduce the cost per pound of launchingpayloads into space to one-sixth of that for conventional launchers.    this a Estimate, however, does not include the development cost of Post-Apollo.The claim also appears to rest on current National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) plans for total launch payloads of 13, 000 tons ormore between 1979 and 1990.    These plans allow for an unknown quantityof United States Department of Defense uses.1
COSTS AND BENEFITS4. If costs are shared on the European Space Research Organisation(ESRO) pattern the United Kingdom share of the tug would be about 50 million.    These are United States estimates and ESRO experience suggests that European costs in space technology projects may be five or six times United States costs.    The whole project is at the frontiers of technology where we know from bitter experience how optimistic original estimates are likely to be.5. The United Kingdom has no foreseeable user interest in spaceactivity on the Post-Apollo scale.    The benefits will accrue mainly to theUnited States, which is the only country involved with a direct interest in amassive project with a personnel-carrying capability.    There can be little doubt that the United States regards European participation mainly as a wayof sharing the enormous cost risk involved     Within Europe, any benefitswill accrue mainly to France and Germany, who have committed themselvesheavily to European launcher development, and may see Europeancollaborative participation in Post-Apollo as a way to get off the hook,6. The only beneficiaries from United Kingdom participation will be theUnited Kingdom space industry.    The idea that we shall be helping theindustry to compete internationally is an illusion.    Hardly any national orinternational space contracts are let by genuinely open competition.    Thebenefit which United Kingdom industry gets from our membership of ESROis in fact less than half our contribution to that Organisation.7. So there is in fact no economic benefit to be gained by joining thePost-Apollo programme.    The Chief Scientific AIviser&apos;s view is that thereis no foreseeable scientific purpose which would justify United Kingdomparticipation in this largely undefined programme on such a scale.UNITED KINGDOM HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMMITMENTS8, For the United Kingdom Post-Apollo is technology for its own sake -1960s style.    It is but one of a number of areas where British industry canplay a part only if there is a large injection of public funds.    We cannot inthe long run successfully take part in them all.    We are already fairlydeeply committed in the fields of civil aircraft, nuclear reactors and (bearing!in mind the recent decision by the Ministerial Committee on economic policy) computers.    Post-Apollo is basically a launcher project.    Overthe last few years we have progressively withdrawn from the launcherbusiness.    It costs us nothing to stay out.9. We have in the past wasted too much money for too little result by       Irefusing to admit that a policy of concentration is inevitable until it is too late to be effective.    I invite the Cabinet to reaffirm their decision ofNovember 1970 not to join in Post-Apollo or any design studies connectedwith it.M V M !Treasury Chambers28 February 1972
