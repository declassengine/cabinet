DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(72)12 COPY NO       621 February 1972CABINETEUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department, The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has, after consultationwith me, renewed for a period of two years United Kingdom acceptance oftwo optional articles of this Convention,    These articlesa. extend the jurisdiction of the European Commission on human rights to petitions submitted, not by States Parties, but by individuals, non-governmental organisations, or groups of individuals claiming to have suffered a violation of  he rightsguaranteed by the Convention and b. provide for a declaration by a State Party that it recognisesas compulsory the jurisdiction of the European Court of human rights in all matters concerning the interpretation and applicationof the Convention.2. The United Kingdom originally subscribed to these articles for athree-year period, in 1966.    Acceptance was renewed for a further threeyears in 1969, to expire on 13 January last,3. The Home Office is the chief (although not the only) sufferer at thehands of the Commission.    None of the cases in which we have been involved have yet reached the stage of being reported to the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe or referred to the European Court,so that it would have been unduly precipitate to refuse to renew the articleswhen the cases were still undecided and there remained the hope that wiserjudgments than those of the Commission itself might prevail.    But our experience is such that it does not seem right to commit ourselves too far ahead j and it may come to refusal in two years1 time.    I think that mycolleagues should at this stage know why.4. There are three main categories of petition of concern to the HomeOffice:a. those of would-be immigrants,b. those of prisoners, andc. those from Northern Ireland.1
a. IMMIGRANTS5. In the current cases concerning East African Asians, the commission are moving towards the conclusion that the Commonwealth Immigrants Act1968 (recently reaffirmed by Parliament in the Immigration Act 1971) is inits application to East African United Kingdom Passport Holders in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, which states that &quot;No-one shall be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;,,    Their viewsseem to us entirely perverse.    They are now endeavouring, as enjoined bythe Convention, to reach a &quot;friendly settlement&quot; of the dispute, but on conditions that would be quite unacceptable to us since they would involvevirtual repeal of our statutory provisions.    The cases seem bound,therefore, to come before the European Court,    The Court may, or may not, adopt a more sensible interpretation of Article 3 (which was clearly aimed at the kind of practices indulged in by the Gestapo in NaziGermany and on its face has nothing whatever to do with immigration).If they do not we shall be put in a most embarrassing situation - andanyway we are in for a good deal of tiresome publicity,b. PRISONERS6, Individual petitions to the Commission from prisoners now amountto about 100 a year.    They comprise a whole variety of complaints;  ofdenial of access to the courts, and of treatment by the courts, the police and in prison.    Although the Commission have not yet presumed to review the decisions of our courts on matters of fact, we have in some cases beenplaced in the difficult position of having to account for the conduct of thecourts in procedural matters.7.        Although the Commission have so far held the majority of petitionsfrom prisoners to be inadmissible, it takes them an extraordinarily longtime to reach this point, and this prolonged sifting process has itself costofficers of the Department a quite disproportionate amount of time and effort.    In those cases of which the Commission finally decides to takecognisance, a good deal of work is involved.    It now appears that one ortwo petitions may be upheld by the Commission.    This has unwelcomepractical consequences in enforcing changes in prison rules and practice which are not in our view at all justified on the merits; and prisoners are becoming increasingly aware of the scope provided by petitions for evadingthe restrictions on letters and visits and compelling the disclosure of documents which may then be used to try to mount litigation in this country.A considerable practical problem is thus in prospect.c. NORTHERN IRELAND8,        The articles do not bear on the reference made to the commission by the Republic of Ireland, as a State Party to the Convention,    But theydo bear on those which may be made by individuals or non*-governmental organisations.    The introduction of internment, combined with allegations of torture, could well lead to an increase in the number of these, used asa political weapon with the deliberate intention of fomenting prejudice andsuspicion.
conclusion. Unless there is a marked change of heart by the Commission, or unless the tendency of the Commission towards developing a newjurisprudence by extending the meaning of the Convention is correctedby decisions of the European Court, continued acceptance of these optionalarticles by the United Kingdom is likely to bring us neither benefit norcredit.    I know that the Attorney General fears that, unless there arechanges, there will be an increasing number of cases in which we shallbe unable to accept the Commission^ rulings because we take a differentview on what is just and right.    Other States Parties, notably Belgium,have also been given cause to resent the Commissions attitudes, and itmay be that some concerted action can be devised.    Failing this, it is acalculation whether we shall be exposed to greater political harm by continuing to subscribe to these articles or by withdrawing from them.10. I circulate this for the information of my colleagues in order thatthey may be fully aware of the context in which acceptance of the optionalarticles has been renewed.R m home office February 19723
