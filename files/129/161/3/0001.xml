THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY JS government cp(72)3 COPY NO      ^7 January 1972CABINETLOCAL ELECTIONS:  MINIMUM AGE FOR CANDIDATESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment1. Home and Social Affairs Committee have considered how we should deal with an Opposition amendment to the Local Government Bill, whichseeks to reduce the minimum age for membership of a local authority from21 to 18.    If we accepted it, we should be under strong pressure to make thesame reduction in the minimum age for election to the House of Commons.2. Young people can now vote at 18, and there is no logical reason why they should not also be able to stand at 18 as candidates at local governmentand Parliamentary elections.    As to tactics, one possibility would be to announce, before the amendment was reached, a decision to make thechange for local elections.    Another would be to allow a free vote in the commons on the change for local elections (which - in spite of misgivings,particularly among Government supporters - would probably result in thechange being made).    But either of these courses would largely pre-empta decision on a corresponding change for Parliamentary elections, and home and Social Affairs Committee concluded that the best course would beto take the initiative by announcing that the question of a change for parliamentary elections would be referred to a Speaker&apos;s Conference later this year, and to oppose the amendment to the Local Government Bill onthe ground that a decision in relation to local elections should await the outcome of the Conference.3. Unless my colleagues think it necessary to discuss this, in which case it could perhaps be raised at the meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday11 January, I propose to proceed accordingly.R m home office January 1972
