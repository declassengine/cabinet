Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1959,C. (59) 23 Copy No. 5 311th February, 1959CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY: HORTICULTUREMemorandum by the Prime minister hope that we may be able to dispose of this issue at our next meeting. It maybe helpful if I summarise the alternative courses of action which have emerged from our earlier discussions:  -(a) We can concede forthwith a 33-^ per cent, increase in the tariff on cutflowers together with some increase in the quota for Dutch bulbs.This should suffice to hold the position for the time being; and we canthen consider, at relative leisure, the scope and form of a wider enquiry into the whole question of horticultural protection. Our decision onsuch an enquiry can be announced at whatever point in the futureis most convenient.(b) Alternatively, we can reject the application for an increase in the tariff on cut flowers on the ground that the economic case for such anincrease has not been made out. If so, however, we shall have rejectedall the current applications for increases in the horticultural tariff andwe shall have to admit that the tariff can no longer be regarded as asatisfactory instrument of horticultural protection. In that case weshall not be able to hold the position unless we announce at once thatwe propose to institute an enquiry into alternative remedies for the unsatisfactory position of the horticultural industry.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,10th February, 1959.secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
