confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1959C (59) 6 Copy No. 5 519th January, 1959CABINETCHEVENINGmemorandum by the prime minister in 1943 Sir Winston Churchill accepted a generous offer by Lord Stanhope toleave Chevening House and its contents and about 3,500 acres* round it, with asubstantial endowment for its upkeep, to be used after his death as a residence forthe Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary or other senior Minister, or to a memberof the Royal Family.2. Recently, Lord Stanhope, who is now 78, started to discuss thearrangements for giving effect to his wish. As the object of his gift or bequestwould not be charitable, it was clear that legislation would be necessary to over-ridethe rule against perpetuities. Lord Stanhope would have preferred to avoidpublicity for his plan during his lifetime and I have looked into the possibility oflegislating after his death. I had to tell him, however, that there would be some risk to his scheme if he left it to the Government of the day to legislate on thebasis of a wish expressed in his will. Legislation after his death would have toextinguish the hopes of the residual heirs and might, therefore, be contentious ifit were argued that the State was abusing its powers to cut out rights of privatesuccession. The legislation would also have to contain retrospective provisions forthe benefit of the Crown, exempting the endowment fund from estate duty.Legislation after Lord Stanhope&apos;s death accordingly involved the risk that, ifopposition to the measure proved embarrassing, the Government of the day mighthave to drop it.* The productive land is let to tenants. All the land, apart from some 1,000 acres to preservthe amenities, could be sold if at any time this was desirable.
3. Legislation during Lord Stanhope&apos;s lifetime would be free from these difficulties and could follow closely the model of the Chequers Estate Act, 1917,as amended by the 1958 Act that is to say, a Deed of Gift annexed as a scheduleto a validating Act of Parliament. Lord Stanhope has now agreed that legislation in his lifetime would be the best way to proceed and has set in hand the preparationof the necessary Trust Deed.4. The trust would set up a body of administrative trustees which, like theChequers Trust, would, I hope, be under the chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal.There would also be nominees of the Prime Minister and Minister of Works. the trust would dispose of an income of some  25,000 (from investments not confined to trustee securities), which should cover the ordinary expenses of upkeep. there might however be a substantial initial outlay on modernisation and there would bepower to draw on capital for this.5. Sir Winston Churchill has already accepted this gift, and it would bechurlish to seek to withdraw from the proposition at this stage. In any case Iconsider that Chevening would serve a very useful purpose, particularly as it is soeasily reached from London. It is a fine house of historic interest and full oftreasures. I would therefore like to proceed now to announce the gift and tointroduce the necessary legislation. In view of Lord Stanhope&apos;s age, the last stepis a matter of urgency. I hope therefore that my colleagues will agree that a Billshould be drafted without delay and introduced as soon as possible. I would ofcourse propose to inform the Leader of the Opposition so as to secure the supportof the official Opposition for the Bill.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,19th January, 1959.
