IjQ--,-- -r21st January, 1959CABINETHORTICULTURE;  TARIFF ON CUT FLOWERSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food on 16th January the Cabinet invited me to give further consideration,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President ofthe Board of Trade, to the implications of raising the tariff on cut flowers(C.C. (59) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2).2.      In August, 1957, the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N. F. Us.) submittedan application for the following increases in import duties:-Roses and Carnations - increase from Is.  8d. to 2s. 6d. per lb.Polyanthus Narcissi    - increase from 4-^d. to 7d. per lb.Anemones - increase from Is.  8d. to 2s. 6d. per lb.&quot;Other Flowers&quot; - increase from Is. 8d. to 2s. Od. per lb.The present duties, which operate all the year round, were increased tothese levels in 1954 as a result of Government decisions on an earlierapplication by the N. F. Us.3.      The major considerations for and against raising the tariff are asset out in the following paragraphs.4.      The major arguments in favour of an increase are:-(a) It would help the glasshouse section of the horticulturalindustry, which has been hardest hit by rising costs,and the small flower growers of Devon, Cornwall andthe Scilly Isles where unemployment is high;  and aneconomic case can be argued for raising the flowertariff.(b) It would demonstrate to the growers that the tariffremains the Governments chief instrument for promoting stability, efficiency and proper levels of remuneration for horticulture.(c) It v/ould not affect the cost-of-living index.
The major arguments against an increase are:-(a) The Tariff Advisory Committee does not consider thatthe economic case has been established in respect ofany of these flowers.    The main reason for their conclusion is the increase in home production.(b) This being so, an increase would tend to undermineconfidence in the tariff machinery.(c) It would particularly affect Holland and France andwould make more difficult the negotiations for a european Free Trade Area.(d) It would raise the price of cut flowers which arebought by all sections of the community.J.
