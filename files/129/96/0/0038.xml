THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 382 5th February, 1959INDONESIA: ASSURANCES TO THE DUTCH government memorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign AffairsBefore he left for Moscow the Foreign Secretary asked that thequestion of the supply of arms to Indonesia should be settled with allpossible speed.   We are under great pressure from several quarters toauthorise the export of military and naval equipment of different kinds to indonesia, but we are having to hold up all action on this till the matter hasbeen aired in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and ifpossible a common line has been agreed.   I would like to have it dealt within N.A.T.O, early next week.2.      The line we are intending to take in N.A.T.G. is that we should infuture refuse export licences only when we have reason to think that thesupplies requested would add dangerously to the offensive potential of the indonesian forces.    This will inevitably be unpalatable to the Dutch whom we have undertaken to consult in advance on the instructions to be sent tothe United Kingdom representative.   I am arranging to see the DutchAmbassador on 27th February for this purpose.   But it will help usconsiderably to create the right conditions for useful discussions in N.A.T.O.if I can tell him at the same time that we are ready to give the dutch government the formal assurance about our support in the event of the indonesian attack on West new guinea which has already been discussed withthem, and to which the Foreign Secretary referred at Cabinet on22nd January, 1959 (C.C.(59) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 2).3.      The assurance proposed is in the following words:-&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government sincerely hope that the IndonesiE-n Govern&quot;ment will in fact adhere to their declared policy of refraining from usingforce to prosecute their claim to Netherlands new guinea.    If, nevertheless,the Indonesian Government should resort to force Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould give their support to the Netherlands Government.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot enter into a commitment to provide military support butthey would do everything within their power to assist the Netherlands Govern-ment in other appropriate ways. &quot;This formula is of course a studiedly vague one, and the exact natureof the support which we would provide under the heading &quot;other appropriateways&quot; would remain with us to decide.   The implications of our giving fulllogistical support to the Dutch are at present being studied by the Chiefsof Staff.    But it would certainly be taken to bind us to giving the Dutch some-1-COPY NO.   )&quot;-?cabinet confidential
CONFIDENTIAL179concrete support, and the Foreign Secretary has it in mind that our support would have to be similar in kind, though naturally not in extent, to that given by the United States.We are also proposing to make a general statement to the indonesians in the following form:-&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government are opposed to the use of force to effect territorial changes, and they do not regard as valid the Indonesianclaim to Netherlands New Guinea.   They have therefore been glad to note the statements made by the Indonesian President and Foreign Minister that force will not be used to prosecute the Indonesian claim.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment regard these statements as constituting an important decisionof the settled policy of the Indonesian Government, and they count on thispolicy being maintained. &quot;4.     After being approved by the Prime Minister on 2nd January, 1959these proposed statements were shown to the Australians and the Americans.Mr. Menzies, the Australian Prime Minister, in a personal message tothe Prime Minister dated 8th January, 1959, said that the commonwealth government fully appreciated the practical nature of the proposed assurance to the Netherlands.   The State Department have noted our proposals andhave raised no objection to them.   The assurance which we propose to give to the Netherlands Government was also shown by the Foreign Secretary to dr. Luns, the Dutch Foreign Minister, when he came to London at theend of January.   On this occasion the Foreign Secretary made it clear thathe was speaking ad referendum and that further consultation with hiscolleagues would be required before he could make the formal commitment.5.      If my colleagues will approve the terms of the proposed assurance to be given to the Netherlands Government, I will communicate them to theDutch Ambassador when he calls on Friday next.   The way will then beopen to deal with the matter of arms supply to Indonesia in N.A.T.O. early next week.J.D.P.Foreign Office, S.W.I.25th February, 1959-2-
