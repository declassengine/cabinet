COTTONMemorandum by the president  ofthe Board of trade the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Minister ofLabour, the Lord President, the Minister of Pensions and national insurance, and the Economic Secretary, &quot;to consider the scope forspecial action by the Government to assist the cotton textile industry&quot;   (C.C.(59) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 2).     I now submit areport from the Ministerial Committee set up under my chairmanshipin accordance with that decision.2.       The Committee has held two meetings.   Its main object hasbeen to determine whether special action to assist cotton should takethe form of assistance to the industry itself or to the cotton textileareas.   We have concluded that the former would be the right course.The cotton textile areas as a whole already contain a very wide range of industries, and their present and prospective level of unemployment is considerably lower than that of several other areas (e.g. Scotland,West South Wales, Cornwall) which are less attractive for  industriallocation.   Moreover, discrimination in favour of Lancashire wouldrequire legislation and would not divert pressure for direct assistanceto the cotton industry.   There may, however, be some cotton townsoutside Development Areas which, owing to their physical isolation and heavy dependence on cotton, may develop high and persistent unemployment.The desirability of adding such towns to the Development Areas (TreasuryAdvisory) Committee (D.A.T.A.C.) list is being urgently examined.3.       With regard to assistance for the industry, the Cotton Board arepursuing as a matter of urgency the preparation of schemes by thevarious sections of the industry, and they have asked the Governmentmeantimeto refrain from taking any initiative.   The Committee agreedthat in these circumstances we should wait for the industry&apos;s proposals to come forward in a few weeks&apos; time.   I have impressed uponLord Rochdale, Chairman of the Cotton Board, the importance ofspeedy action, while at the same time warning him that assistancefrom the Government will necessarily be limited and conditional.My officials have already had a preliminary discussion with himabout proposals now being prepared by the weavers.4.       The Committee also considered the question of unemploymentbenefit for short-time workers.   This question is of importance forthe cotton industry since some 10,000 of its workers have been on short-time for about a year.    A Tribunal of Insurance Commissionersa   * due to give a ruling shortly that will determine whether or not-1-COPY NO.VNC.(59) 2917th February, 1959CABINET
131workers who have been on short-time for more than a year can continueto draw unemployment benefit.   The Committee agreed that if this rulingwere adverse the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance should be supported in the introduction of an amending regulation forthwith.This matter is being submitted to the Cabinet separately.5.      Trade has improved somewhat in the cotton industry over the last three weeks since the Restrictive Practices Court gave its judgment onthe yarn spinners&apos; agreement.   The initial alarm about the effects ofthe judgment appears to have subsided, and there is now less talk aboutlarge-scale unemployment in the industry.Summary of conclusions.      The Committee agreed that:-(a) Any special action to help cotton should take the form of direct assistance to the industry itself rather than to Lancashire.(b) The scope of this assistance should be considered further on thebasis of the proposals to be submitted shortly by the industry.(c) Meantime, particular cotton towns should be added to the D.A.T.A.C.list as necessary.(d) The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance should be supported in his proposal to introduce, if necessary, an amendingregulation to permit continued payment of unemployment benefit to workers who have been on short-time for more than a year.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.I.16th February, 1959
