CONFIDENTIAL      &apos;&apos; &apos;.. :THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAiESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. January 1959C. (59) 1 Copy No. %\7th January, 1959CABINETGOVERNMENT BUSINESSNote by the Prime minister when the House meets again we shall be well embarked on the last full sessionof this Parliament. We have begun that session well: we must go forward in thesame spirit of energy and imagination. We shall help ourselves to do so, if we canclear our official work of some unnecessary complications. At this season of goodresolutions my colleagues will perhaps bear with me if I suggest some which we might observe to our common advantage in the New Year:  First, let us be brief and clear.  We all have too much to do in particular, ^S^-ut^we have too much paper to read. Much of it is unavoidable; but some of it wemanufacture for ourselves. A conscious effort is needed to put things simply and  concisely and to persuade our officials to do so.  But the saving in time andtemper is well worth it. And it makes for speedier and more effective action.Secondly, let us be businesslike in the conduct of our collective work. Recently,too many proposals have been submitted to the Cabinet at short notice and with *inadequate inter-Departmental preparation.  I know very well that the pressure -of events sometimes makes this inevitable. But often the fault is our own. Weshould constantly remind ourselves that the Cabinet should not be troubled with t-0^ I,any question which can be settled by a Cabinet Committee, and that the Committees        ,oshould not be asked to devote time to problems which can be settled by directdiscussion between the Ministers concerned. More thorough devolution will giveall of us more time to think about the things which really require thought.Thirdly, let us be more vigilant to keep our secrets. There have been several occasions recently when our intentions have leaked out in advance.  I do notunderestimate the importance of good relations with the Press.  But premature -,uu** .disclosure of Government policy is always embarrassing and sometimes dangerous; M 2 %
, 2 confidential and in the end it could undermine our cohesion for confidential discussion among&apos;colleagues is the essence of Cabinet government We must all make fresh efforts to ensure that those who are entrusted with confidential information respect theirtrust.In the last 12 months we have travelled a long way, both politically and economically; and nothing that I can say can adequately express my gratitude foro the loyal support which I have had from all my colleagues. It is because I valueU that support so highly that I venture to commend to them the simple principles which I have indicated in this note and to ask them to renew their efforts in 1959to ensure that, whatever the future may hold, the period of office of this administration will be remembered as one of firm, prompt and vigorousgovernment.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,6th January, 1959.
