C..(59) 4 C -FY N&apos;13th January. 1959CABINETSERVICE WIDOWS] AND WAR WIDOWS&apos; pensions memorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National insurance agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he says inhis memorandum (C.(59) 2) that the implementation of the GriggCommittee&apos;s recommendation in respect of the widows of existing pensioner,&quot;and of existing widows of regular Servicemen will have repercussions on war widows.2.        As the Chancellor knows, the whole question of war widows is atthe moment in any event a most difficult one, and he is already aware oftwo proposals which on their merits (apart altogether from the GriggCommittee&apos;s recommendation) I have suggested to him should be adopted.On one of these, having failed to settle the matter with the Chancellor, Iwas about in any event to submit the matter for decision by the Cabinet;the other has at this stage only been put to him in a preliminary way.   Theeffect of acceptance of the Grigg recommendation will be to make theseproposals (which are set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 of this paper) the more necessary to accept;  but I think that their adoption could prevent any furtherrepercussions in respect of war widows.3. I am sure, however, that it would be necessary to go as far as this.    Public opinion, the ex-Service organisations and, I expect, the Houseof Commons, would find it difficult to justify doing nothing further to help the widow of a non-regular killed in action or otherwise dying as a resultof his service at a time when improvements were being made in respectof the widows of regulars whether their death was due to service causes ornot.4. I do not, however, think that, if steps are taken to deal with the warwidow in the ways suggested below (which do not touch the basic rate), thereneed be any such repercussions from the Grigg proposals as are suggestedin paragraph 3 of the Chancellor&apos;s memorandum in respect of industrial injuries or on the rates of national assistance.   This assessment is, howeverbased on the assumption that, by moving promptly on two points affectingwar widows, we forestall the building up of pressure on the basic rates -from which repercussions would be inevitable.5.        The proposal which I have put to the Chancellor only in a preliminary way, but which I think it necessary to mention in the context of the Grigg proposals, is that we might introduce a new &quot;comforts&quot;allowance of 10s. Od. a week for the oldest of the war widows, i. e. , those-1-s eg retTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
over 70, on whose position the ex-Service organisations place the mainemphasis.    This would be somewhat analogous to the age and comfortsallowances which are already paid to seriously disabled war pensioners.Neither of these allowances has had any significant repercussions in theindustrial injury field.   The cost of such an allowance for war widow/sovereignty 70 would be of the order of Lij millions a year, but, as indicated above, it is probable that we should have to introduce this anyhow.6.         I have already mentioned that 1 have been unable to reach agree-ment with the Chancellor on a proposal to improve the position of warwidows receiving national assistance.    It also is related to the foregoingby reason of the fact that many of the war widows on national assistanceare over 7 0 and, under the present practice of the National assistance board, the benefit of any new allowance would be reduced or nullified bythe withdrawal or reduction of their assistance allowance.   In brief, my proposal, which is more fully explained in the Appendix to this paper, wouldenable the National Assistance Board to disregard 10s. 6d. a week of awar widowrs pension when assessing her means for the-purpose of national assistance, thus putting her in the same position as widows of civil servants,policemen, firemen, miners or railwaymen.   The cost in respect of widowsat present on assistance would be of the order of  100,000 a year.7.         My conclusion is, therefore, that the decision on the Griggrecommendations need not be affected by the fear of serious repercussions in my field, provided that steps are taken promptly to meet and forestallthe reaction which they would undoubtedly produce in respect of war widows.J.A.B.-c ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, W.C.Z.13th January, 1959-2-
By Statute (Natic  a.1 Assistance Act, 1948), ZDs. of a wardisability pension or industrial injury disablement pension, and 10s. 6d.of a superannuation payment in respect of a person&apos;s own employment,or of friendly society or trade union sick pay, are disregarded.    Inaddition, on a discretionary basis, the National Assistance Board has for some years disregarded 10s. 6d, of any charitable or voluntarypayment, including payments by employers to the widows of formeremployees, and, in particular, to the widows of civil servants, policemenfiremen, miners or railwaymen.     They also disregard by discretion10s. 6d. of a parenfs need pension under the war pensions scheme.2.     After the National Assistance Board had had some discussionwith me last summer about the disregards, the conclusion was reached that it would not be right to propose any change in the disregardsgenerally but that, in the case of an application by a war widow for national assistance, it would be reasonable to disregard, for the purposeof assessing her means, 10s. 6d. per week of her widow&apos;s pension.An approach was made accordingly to the Treasury by the Board inSeptember.3.      From the war pensions angle the problem of widows, particularly the older ones, is at present the most difficult one which we have to face.     The British Legion, the British Legion (Scotland) and BritishLimbless. Ex-Servicemen^ Association have given the case of widowspriority on their claims.     Meetings which the Parliamentary secretary and I attend of the War Pensions Committee Chairmen of each regiongive broadly the same impression, and indeed some sixty committees have already asked for disregards for the war widow.    The Soldiers1,Sailors1 and Airraen&apos;s Families Association have made the samerequest in a recent letter to me.4.     All the evidence I have points to the fact that real hardship is confined to a comparatively small number of those widows (mostlyelderly).     The total number of war widows over 70 is about 58,800 ofwhom 54,800 are First War widows.    The increasing age of warwidows, with its concomitant of a relatively small number of reallyhard cases, is making it more and more difficult to hold the existingstandard rate of war widows&apos; pension.    It is, of course, inevitable thata disregard would increase the number of war widows on assistance.This effect, however, is well recognised in ex-Service circles, and Iconsider that this concession to help the most needy would make thepresent level of war widows&apos; pensions easier rather than more difficultto hold.5.      The rise in rents in recent years has had the effect of erodingin a limited number of cases the preference for war widows which,together v/ith that for other war pensioners, has been upheld as a major principle by all Ministers of Pensions.    The assistance-3-8ECRETAPPENDIXWAR WIDOWS AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE
scale for a single householder, e. g. a widow, is now 45s. plus rent.In casest therefore, where rent exceeds 21s. a week, a war widow on the basic scale of 66s. a week receives no advantage, if she resorts to assistance, over a civilian widow, or, indeed, over any other singlerecipient of assistance.6,      In one respect, however, the war widow receives, not preference,but inferior treatment.     In 1949 widows of civil servants were granted a disregard for assistance purposes of 10s. 6d. a week, as mentionedabove.     Similarly, the widows of the policemen and other categoriesmentioned in paragraph 1 were given the benefit of that disregard.     Itis fortunate that so far the ex-Service organisations (and indeed Members;of Parliament) have not been aware of this differentiation in treatment,which would plainly be difficult to defend.7.      It was part of the proposal that the National Assistance board should also give this disregard to the pensions of widows of regular officers and men who die for reasons not connected with their war service.      They recognise, as I do, that the present discrimination between these widows also and the Civil Service and police widows isanomalous.8.      The cost for existing cases is estimated at about  100,000;   it isnot possible to estimate the expenditure in respect of any new cases which would be admitted to assistance in consequence, but this would notadd a great deal.-4-
