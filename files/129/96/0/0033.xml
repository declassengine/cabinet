C.(59) 33 COPY NO.^L16th February, 1959CABINETAGRICULTURE (SMALL, FARMERS) BILL:WITHDRAWAL OF MARGINAL PRODUCTION scheme memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food in his paper (C.(59) 28) the Secretary of State for Scotlandputs forward a suggestion that Clause 3 of the Small Farmers Billshould be dropped and that marginal agricultural production assistance should be continued for the time be ing in Scotland.   This suggestion would raise serious difficulties.2. We are all agreed that we must aim at more competitive homeagricultural production and not at maximum production.   Any proposalto give special assistance to marginal areas because their costs are highis inconsistent with this.3. Furthermore I must be excused for expressing doubts on the validity of the views, reported in paragraph 4 of the Secretary of State&apos;s paper, that the withdrawal of marginal agricultural production assistance would lead to a restriction of cultivation of marginal land or to a seriousdrop in the number of beef store cattle.   This is the type of production for which much of this land is admirably suited and store, cattle prices are now high and likely to remain so.   Withdrawal of the grants would reduce the incomes of the farmers concerned, but t doubt whether it wouldmake their farming unprofitable.    Consequently, the fears of de-population and unemployment seem to be exaggerated.4. This applies particularly because the farmers immediatelyaffected - and those apparently responsible for the present complaints -are those with more than 150 acres of crops and grass (i. e. excludingrough grazings, which may be extensive) and whose farming incomes mustbe expected to be at least  1,000 to  1,500 a year,   other eligible farmersmay continue to receive marginal agricultural production assistance for another three years, which seems to me to provide adequately for the gradual withdrawal of assistance suggested in paragraph 7 of the paper bythe Secretary of State.5. I do not consider, therefore, that any case has been made outon merits for a change of policy.   And if marginal agricultural productionassistance is continued in Scotland it will have embarrassing repercussionsfor me.   In Wales and Northern Ireland in particular our small farmerproposals will be denying assistance to many farmers who formerly7*      *J  CONFIDENTIAL-9(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)
received marginal production assistance.   So far this has not been aserious problem but, if the marginal agricultural production scheme inScotland were resurrected, we would be in real difficulty.   There wouldbe pressure for a similar concession in the rest of the United Kingdom.6. So far as I can see, any such concession would mean that thesmall farmer scheme would be jeopardised because I have insufficienttechnical staff to run the small farmer scheme and a marginal productionscheme simultaneously.   Shortage of technical staff has been the mainbottleneck on the small farmer scheme, and such staff can only be augmented slowly and with great difficulty.7. I strongly urge my colleagues, therefore, to adhere to thedecisions already taken. If it would help, I could agree that the hill cowsubsidy should be increased at this year&apos;s annual review, though I do notconsider that there are strong grounds even for this step.T.H.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.W.1.16th Fsbruary, 1959-2-
