STRATEGIC AIR FREIGHTERMemorandum by the Minister of SupplyNormally, when a new military aircraft is ordered, the aircraftmanufacturers are formally invited to submit designs to meet a givenspecification. In the case of the strategic air freighter this has not beendone.   The examination has been confined to designs which certain air-craft firms had drawn up without full knowledge of the Service require-ment.   All these are adaptations of existing aircraft;  none of them is entirely satisfactory.   The matter has now become one of urgency, andthe problem is to reconcile the need for an aircraft within a reasonablyshort time with the need for an aircraft which will be satisfactory in the longer term.   This memorandum sketches a proposal to effect thisreconciliation.2. The short term.    The Britannia aircraft, while designed for the carrying of passengers, can be adapted for the carrying of freight byredesigning the rear section of the fuselage to accommodate a rearloading door.   This and lesser modifications might cost  1 million for development.   The firms concerned, Short Brothers and Karland limited and Bristol Aircraft Limited, have received an enquiry from the UnitedStates (where the carrying of freight by air is already large and is rapidly increasing) for half a dozen such freighter versions by 1960-61.It will hardly be economic to amortise the development cost over such asmall order as six.   But it would be economic if the order were ekedout by a military order, which in turn might stimulate the civil sales.3. The Air Ministry have on order twenty Britannias for transport command;  these are side-loaders and therefore of limited usefulness asfreighters.   They are manufactured in the main at Shorts and are due for completion by the end of next year.   If the Air Ministry were to place anorder for, say, half a dozen of the rear loading freighter version - either a new order or an order for the conversion of the last half dozen fromtheir existing order for twenty - the firms would be able to respondfavourably to the interest being shown abroad in this freighter version ofthe Britannia.   Three results would follow:-(i)      we should, as a country, quickly be in a position to caterinitially for the market in large freighter aircraft;(ii)      the A rmed Forces would have half a dozen aircraft which couldbe used for the carrying of bulky freight as well as troops,and the aircraft, though not perfect, should go some way to meeting their long-distance freighting needs for the first halfof the 1960&apos;s; .SSCRET*&apos; (n-    \ .. )mffjDOC UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 17 COPY NO.

(iii)      there would be some immediate alleviation of the unemploy-ment position at Belfast.4.        The longer term.   For the longer term the Ministry of Supply,after consultation with the Air Ministry and the Ministry of transport and Civil Aviation, should formally issue a specification directed towards meeting the optimum requirement, via. a long-range fast militaryfreighter and an economical civil freighter.   It is essential that the specification should be drawn up quickly, that the designs should besubmitted quickly and that they should be studied quickly.   Reasonableintervals for each stage would be three months.   It is also essential tomy mind that the specification should pay regard to civil as well asto military needs.   I would emphasise this because a military order forten aircraft is scarcely in itself worthwhile and advantage should betaken of the order to try to enter the civil market.   For this reason the ministries of Supply and Transport should be associated with the drawing up of the requirement.   Lastly it is essential in my opinion that the choice of the contractor should be made in the light not only of the paperdrawing, but also of his ability to produce and his likely place in the long-term structure of the industry.   Granted reasonable expedition oneverybody1 s part, a new jet freighter could be in service with the R.A.F.by late 1965 - a year later than the date promised for the H.P.111 (late1964).   The aircraft should be designed ab initio to take, after the jetengine, a ducted fan engine, which, while maintaining the speed requiredfor military purposes, would also provide the economics required for civil operation.5.        The Air Ministry could by this means secure for the second halfof the 19607s an aircraft giving them what they want.   Available twelvemonths later than the H.P.111, it would be just as fast as that aircraft,more economical, would have better loading facilities and would be inadvance of anything else obtaining at that time.   From a civil point ofview, it should be in a strong position to exploit the entry into the civilmarket effected in the first half of the 1960&apos;s by the freighter version of the Britannia.    I consider therefore that the proposal has considerablemerits.6.        On the other hand, it has the disadvantage that it is widelyexpected of us that we should now place, not a requirement for a strategic freighter, but an order.   We may well be criticised thereforefor still further delay.   This criticism would, however, be parried insofar as we ordered additional Britannias, and we should be on firm ground incontending that all the designs offered were unsatisfactory.   I therefore recommend the proposal.A.J.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2.6th February, 1959-2-
