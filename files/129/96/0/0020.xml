FARM PRICE REVIEWNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer the line to be taken in discussion with the National Farmers&apos; Unions duringthe annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry is being considered by the Ministerial Committee on the Farm price review. We shall wish to submit our views to the Cabinet later this week. In themeantime I am circulating herewith, for background information, the main factsabout the condition of the industry at the present time.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,9th February, 1959.54721THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1959C. (59) 20 Copy No. 5 g9th February, 1959CABINET
THE ECONOMIC CONDITION AND PROSPECTS OF AGRICULTUREOutputNet output is forecast at 61 per cent, above pre-war for 1958-59 comparedwith 62 per cent, in 1957-58. But for the bad weather there would probably havebeen a small increase instead of this small decrease. Cereal and potato cropyields have been below normal, though total production of cereals was slightlyabove last year when yields were also below normal. The weather has also caused a substantial fall in milk yields. The milking herd has declined, but other livestockhave increased. Production of beef and lamb is rather lower than a year ago, whileproduction of pigmeat is higher; the prospects, however, are for a renewedexpansion in beef and lamb production and a fall in output of pigmeat. Eggproduction continues to increase. Consumption of concentrated feedingstuffs hasbeen higher, partly due to the weather.Costs2. There is a net cost increase of  11-1 millions on review commodities, and 15 millions on all commodities. This is practically the same as a year ago. Mostof it is due to the wage increase last October.Income3. The actual net income of the industry for 1958-59 is forecast at 327 millions as compared with the record level of  3544 millions for 1957-58. Thisis a fall of some  27^ millions and is due to the bad weather. If there had beennormal weather it is estimated that the net income in 1958-59 would have been 360^ millions as compared with a normal weather estimate of  355 millions in1957-58.Exchequer Cost4. The cost of Exchequer subsidies to agriculture has fallen substantially thisyear. From  240 millions in 1956-57 it rose to  284 millions in 1957-58. It is now estimated to be  248 millions in 1958-59. At the present level of support the latest estimate for 1959-60 is about  250 millions, but any such forward estimate isspeculative.Efficency5. The increasing efficiency of the industry is now assessed at about 25 millions a year for review commodities (though in the current year this hasbeen masked by the weather). This is about 2 per cent, a year on gross output.Guarantees and Costs   t6. Over the period 1952-58 the average change in the total value of the guarantees (i.e., the total income from review commodities which, given currentoutput in each year, would be assured at the then current level of guaranteed prices and production grants) has been a net increase of about  10 millions a year. Theaverage change in factor costs over this period has been a net increase of about 24 millions a year. The difference has to be considered against the increasing efficiency of the industry, now assessed by us at about  25 millions a year for review commodities.Minimum Award7. The long-term assurances under the Agriculture Act, 1957, require thatthe total value of the guarantees this year should not be reduced by more than about  19 millions. This is arrived at by taking 2\ per cent., i.e., about  30^ millions,of the total value of the guarantees and deducting the net cost increase on reviewcommodities of about  1 \\ millions. There is however no suggestion that in thecircumstances of this year the award should be at the minimum.Small Farmer Schemes8. This year&apos;s Annual Review will start with a credit item for the awardtable of about  6 millions for expenditure on the Small Farmer Schemes.
Production Objectives9. The general objective remains that production should be more economicand that there should be a steady improvement in the competitive position of theindustry. In the case of some commodities (potatoes, sugar beet, cattle, sheep, pigs)the objectives do not require any change in the level of the commodity guaranteesthis year. There is a case for reduction for some or all of the remainder (wheat,rye, barley, oats, milk, eggs, wool), but this is under consideration.Figures for Last Few Years10. Figures of net income, net output, and net changes in the total of the guarantees and in factor costs over the last few years are given in the Appendix.5 th February, 1959.APPENDIXTABLE iTotal Farming Net Income Index of Agricultural Net Output(1936-39=100)(actual yields)Actual yields     Normal yields All holdings	  million	  million	1952-53	333	331	1531953-54	331	318	1561954-55	295	330	1521955-56	329	314	1561956-57	319-1	339	1611957-58	3541	355	1621958-59 forecast   .	327	360*	161TABLE iiAnnual review(1)19521953195419551956195719581959Net cost change onreview commodities(2)  million+41+ 17- 7-H33-5-1-36-54-37-5+ h+ 11-5Change in total value of guarantees(3)  million-f-39+ 15-5-30-h28d-25+ 14-19Differences*(col. 3-col. 2)(so-called &quot; under-recoupment &quot;)(4)  million- 2- 1-5-23- 5-5-11-5-23-5-30* These differences have to be considered against the increasing efficiency of the industry nowassessed by us at  25 millions a year.
