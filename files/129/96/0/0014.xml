Progress of theFive-Year Defence PlanModernisation of Fleet1. Substantial progress is being made with modernising existing ships and bringing new ones into service.2. The first of the three Tiger Class cruisers will be commissionednext month. The conversion of H.M.S. Bulwark to the role of Commandocarrier will be completed during the course of the year. These developmentsrepresent a valuable addition to the naval forces available for the protection ofBritish territories and interests overseas.3. Three frigates of the new Tribal Class have been laid down. TheWessex all-weather helicopter has been ordered as a replacement for theWhirlwind and will become the Navy&apos;s main anti-submarine aircraft.4. The Fleet Air Arm is also receiving other new aircraft. these include the Scimitar single-seat fighter-bomber, now coming into service, andthe Sea Vixen two-seater all-weather fighter, which will follow during thecoming year and will be equipped with Firestreak guided missiles. It hasalso been decided to go ahead with the N.A.39, a strike-reconnaissance aircraft with high-speed performance at low level and well suited to limitedwar operations.5. Preliminary work has begun on four guided missile ships of theCounty Class, and two will be laid down in the near future. They will bepropelled by combined steam and gas turbine machinery of exceptionallycompact and light design which will increase the amount of fightingequipment they can carry. The trials of the Seaslug missile, with which theywill be equipped, have shown this to be a most effective weapon for the interception of attacking aircraft at longer ranges. These ships will also carryshorter range guided missiles for close air defence.6, The first three submarines of the Porpoise Class were commissionedlast year, and two more will follow this year. The preparation of material for the construction of Dreadnought is proceeding. The progress of this project is being greatly advanced by the assistance of the United States, from whom the first propulsion unit is being bought.5
are-equipment of army. Having regard to the large numbers of men in the post-war NationalService Army, and the consequently heavy cost of equipping it, it has hitherto been the policy to use up as much as possible of the big stocks of the oldertypes of equipment, which were produced at the end of the Second World Warand were further swelled by increased production during the Korean War.The present five-year defence plan provides for the extensive re-equipment ofthe Army, so that the smaller, but more highly trained, all-regular force of thefuture may operate with maximum efficiency.8. Work has for some time been proceeding on the developmentof a new family of weapons, vehicles and other equipment. These are now coming into service. Within the next twelve months, half the Army will havebeen re-equipped with F.N. rifles and deliveries of Sterling sub-machine gunswill be nearly completed. Two Artillery Regiments have been equipped withthe Corporal guided missile which has a range of 70 miles and can carry a nuclear warhead. Requirements of Ferret scout cars, Saladin armoured cars, and 1-ton armoured trucks will soon have been met in full. A largenumber of lorries, mostly based on commercial types, are being issued toreplace older vehicles in the Rhine Army and elsewhere. Radio communica-tions for the forces in the field are being greatly improved by the introductionof new and more powerful signal equipments. These include the portableManpack, a radio-relay set for improving telephone and telegraphcommunications in the field, and a set for armoured vehicles. Nearly halfthe Army&apos;s requirements for these sets have now been produced.9, Deliveries to the Army of the mobile anti-aircraft missileThunderbird, after successful trials in Australia, have now started and work is proceeding on the development of an improved version. Other weapons and equipment are in varying stages of development. These includeair-transportable anti-tank weapons, self-propelled guns, tracked vehicles,bridging equipment, short-range nuclear weapons.Air Support and Mobility10. A general-purpose aircraft, the TSR.2, is being developed for thesupport of the Army and for other tactical operations. It will have asupersonic, low-flying, all-weather capability and will, in its strike and reconnaissance role, provide a suitable replacement for the Canberra. TheTSR.2 will be capable of carrying nuclear bombs [and air-to-air guided missiles]. Its ability to use airfields of moderate length and light construction in forward areas will be of especial value in the event of limited war.11. In accordance with the Governments policy to increase the mobility of the armed forces, the carrying capacity of RAF. transport command will be further expanded. The Britannias will be coming into service this year for long range movement. These will release Hastingsaircraft for use in the tactical transport role.12. In addition, it is proposed to order a small number of long-distanceair freighters, specially designed to carry bulky equipment, such as guided missiles and their associated radar vehicles.13. It has also been decided to increase the number of tacticalfreighters suitable for dropping parachutists, as well as for normal movements of troops and stores. This requirement will be met by a military version ofthe Armstrong Whitworth Argosy. For shorter range transport, TwinPioneers are beginning to come into service and will be followed later by alimited number of Bristol 192 helicopters.6
Strategic Bombers14. A growing proportion of the British strategic bomber force isbeing equipped with Vulcan and Victor aircraft. Their performance, in speed and altitude, remains unsurpassed by any bomber aircraft in service in anyother country; and recent competitions with the United States Air Force have demonstrated the precision of British navigational aids and bomb-aimingequipment.15. In addition to the already substantial stockpile of kiloton bombs,the production of British megaton weapons is proceeding steadily. The lastseries of British tests and the valuable exchange of information with theUnited States have enabled important technical advances to be made in the design of nuclear warheads. This will permit a significant increase in therate of production.16. The development of propelled stand-off bombs continues to progresssatisfactorily. These will greatly reduce the vulnerability of the aircraft by enabling it to release its weapon a long distance from the target, outside the range of the missile defence system.Ballistic Rockets17. The Government have recently been reviewing the British rocketprogramme. As a result they have come to the conclusion that, on presentknowledge, the British liquid-fuel rocket Blue Streak is best suited to Britishneeds.   The development of this weapon is therefore proceeding as planned.18. Thor missiles are being deployed by the R.A.F. for training purposes.The trials of the missile in America are proceeding well, and the United StatesGovernment confidently expect that the weapon will soon attain the exactingstandards of range and accuracy specified for its operational performance.Air Defence19. The Lightning supersonic fighter, which will come into service nextyear, v/ill initially be equipped with a Firestreak missile, and later with a more advanced weapon capable of intercepting the faster aircraft of the future.20. The task of defending the deterrent bases in Britain against attack by aircraft will be increasingly performed by ground-to-air missiles.Full-scale trials of the Bloodhound rocket have been carried out during thepast year and these weapons are now beginning to be deployed in anoperational role. A more advanced weapon with higher performance is being developed.Civil Defence21. No major change is contemplated in the structure or role of civil defence. During the coming year, the Civil Defence services will be payingspecial attention to the development, in. training and exercises, of new techniques for dealing with radiological hazards. Further orders are being placed for training equipment and further deliveries of operational radiacinstruments will be made. Essential communications will be furtherstrengthened, and as part of the development of the warning and monitoringorganisation constructional work for the Royal Observer Corps will be accelerated.22. Although the prospective end of National Service has made itnecessary to disband the Mobile Defence Corps, the Territorial Army isto be given more specialised training in Civil Defence techniques, and close7
co-operation between the Army and the civil defence authorities willcontinue. A new field for recruitment will be opened up for the civil defence services with the freeing from Reserve liability of nearly 3 million menwhen in June the Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves Act, 1954, will cease to apply to men who entered the Armed Forces before 1949.Inter-Service Commands23. In theatres overseas, there are clear operational advantages in placing the forces of all three Services under a unified Command.24. This system was introduced recently in the Aden Command, whereit is working smoothly and has proved its worth. It has been decided toset up, as soon as practicable, a similar inter-Service Command to embraceBritish naval, army and air forces in the Mediterranean area. The timing of this change will depend on the development of the internal situation in cyprus and certain other considerations. The possibility of setting up a unified Command in the Far East is also being examined.Voluntary Recruitment25. The most important new feature of the policy announced in 1957was the proposal to end National Service in 1962 and to go over to smallerall-regular forces. In order to make that possible a considerable increasein the rate of voluntary recruitment was essential. The Services weregiven authority to recruit up to the following ceilings&quot;. Navy 88,000:Army 165,000; RA.F. 135,000.* The general trend of recruiting during thepast year has been most satisfactory. Subject to some shortages in certainspecialised branches, there is every prospect that all three Services will attaintheir ceilings and could even exceed them if required.26. There never was doubt that the Navy would be able to recruit itsplanned strength, and this is being confirmed by experience. During 1958,the Royal Navy and Royal Marines recruited 8,250 ratings and other ranks.This rate is higher than is needed to attain their ceiling. Indeed, recruitingfor some branches has become competitive. As in the other Services theremay be some shortage of officers, particularly in the Instructor and Medicalbranches, but the numbers are small.27. Recruiting for the Army has been going well. The introduction ofthe minimum 6-year engagement has been fully justified by results. During1958, the Army recruited 22,000 men on engagements of 6 years or more ascompared with 4,900 in 1957. The intake of boys and apprentices, to whichmuch importance is attached, rose during the year by 43%, as a result of whichit has been decided to open additional schools.28. Recruiting for the medical, ordnance, pay and catering services has improved, but is still not fully up to requirements. Should there prove to beshortages, which is not yet certain, the numbers involved will be small and various remedies are being considered.29. One of the Army&apos;s main problems is to increase the supply of officers,both from Sandhurst and other sources. In order to obtain more candidates for Sandhurst, 40 scholarships a year are being offered for boys who intend to apply for regular commissions, and more is being done to increase interestin Army careers among a wider circle of schools.   Young men are also being* Adult U.K. males (all ranks)8
offered 3-year short service commissions direct from civil life. At the sametime every effort is being made to ensure that all men in the ranks, who possess the necessary qualities, are given the opportunity to obtain both regular and short service commissions.30. In general, the present rate of recruiting, if it continues, is sufficient toenable most branches of the Army, including all the fighting arms, to reach theirauthorised establishments by the end of 1962, with a margin to spare. Whilethe Government are satisfied that their present plan for the all-regular Army issoundly conceived, they consider it desirable to ensure that its strength shallnot fall below the planned figure of 165,000. Since in any voluntary forcefluctuations in the level of recruitment are inevitable, it has been decided toaccept recruits in excess of this figure, up to an overall ceiling of about180,000. The additional men will be used to increase the strength of Unitsoverseas and in the Strategic Reserve.31. During 1958, the R.A.F. obtained 13,000 recruits on engagementsof 5 years or more, compared with 9,000 in 1957. At this rate, the ceiling of 135,000 should be reached quite comfortably. Like the Army, the R.A.F.is having some difficulty in obtaining men for certain specialised branches.However, measures are being taken to overcome these deficiencies in various ways.32. Entries of officer cadets into Cranwell and Henlow are reasonably satisfactory, but entries of aircrew, on direct and short-service commissions,are still appreciably below requirements. This may, in part, be dueto the impression that, with the advent of the rocket, aircraft will have littlepart to play. That is, of course, quite wrong. There will continue to be many important operational tasks which only manned aircraft can perform.33. The Women&apos;s Services, including the Nursing Services, have an indispensable part to play in the all-regular forces of the future, in peaceas well as in war; and they have been given responsibilities over a wide range of important duties. The Women&apos;s Services need some 6,000 recruits a year.Although the intake increased in 1958, the rate of recruitment for theW.R.A.C. and the W.R.A.F., is still considerably below requirements.Recruitment for the W.R.N.S. is satisfactory.Contraction of Forces34. In 1957, the combined strength of the three Services stood at nearly700,000. The decision to end National Service in 1962 and to re-organise the armed forces on a voluntary basis involved a reduction of about300,000. By 1st April, 1959, half this planned reduction will have beencompleted.35. The manpower of the Royal Navy has been reduced by 15,000 in thelast two years. The majority of the cuts have been effected in the base andtraining establishments and home air stations and other branches of the shoreorganisation.36. The R.A.F. has completed two-thirds of its planned rundown. Thishas been made possible in part by some reduction in the number of squadrons,but principally by economies in the administrative organisation and training establishments. -37. In the Army the changeover from National Service to a smallerall-regular force entailed reducing the number of major units by about 50.Nearly two-thirds of the necessary amalgamations and disbandments have9
been completed and much credit goes to officers and men of the unitsconcerned for their understanding and loyal co-operation in carrying through these unavoidable but none the less painful changes.38. The most striking change in the future composition of the Army is the big reduction that is being made in the military manpower employed on administrative and garrison duties in the United- Kingdom. By the abolitionof National Service, with its large training organisation and other heavyoverheads, by the extensive replacement of uniformed men by civilians, andby the introduction of labour-saving methods and machinery, it will bepossible to dispense with over 100,000 soldiers who now have to be employedon lion-operational duties. Many administrative and headquarter units havealready been disbanded; and in the static organisation in the United Kingdomover 70 establishments have been closed down during the last two years.Pay and Pensions39. Significant improvements in the conditions of service of the armed forces are being made. Last year the rates of pay were increased forall ranks; and subsequently the independent Advisory Committee on recruiting, under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg, recorded their viewthat the new rates now bear a fair relationship to civilian earnings, and, infact, that, &quot; taken as a whole, people in the Services are, if anything, a little better off than they would have been in civil life.&quot; The Government have accepted the Committee&apos;s recommendation that in future pay and pensions should be reviewed regularly at intervals of not more than two years. Thefirst such review will be carried out in time for any changes that may benecessary to take effect on 1st April, 1960.40. Pensions for other ranks are being substantially increased andterminal grants more than doubled. A sergeant, retiring after 22 years&apos;service, will now receive a terminal grant of about  550, instead of  225,and a pension of about  3 10s. Od. a week instead of  2 7s. 6d. a week. Infuture, widows of Servicemen of all ranks will receive pensions at the rateof one-third of their husband&apos;s retired pay. In most cases this will mean asubstantial increase.41. In accordance with the recommendations of the Grigg Committee,further improvements in Service allowances of various kinds are beingmade. These include higher compensation for the expense of movingfrom one station to another and increased grants for the education ofchildren. In addition, free passages will now be given to children at home to visit then parents abroad once a year.Accommodation42. Good progress is being made with the improvement of the living conditions of the forces at home and overseas. The building programme forthe Services in the United Kingdom, estimated to cost about  90 millions over five years, is now well under way. A variety of new building projects and improvements to single accommodation is going ahead for all three services. In addition, more than 1,000 new houses have been completed during the past twelve months, and it is planned to start on a further 4,000during the coming year.43. Overseas the construction of modern barracks and houses for marriedpeople is continuing. Work will also start this year on new accommodation for the Army in Kenya, including a primary school, and it is planned to build10
a new school in Aden. In addition about  1 million will be spent during thecoming year on improving accommodation and amenities in Cyprus. special attention is being given to working and living conditions in tropical stations,ashore and afloat. In certain exceptionally hot areas air-conditionedaccommodation is being provided. Accommodation and lay-out in ships is being continually improved. Features which are being incorporated inthe latest designs of new ships, and to the greatest extent possible inthose being modernised, include air-conditioning where appropriate, bunksleeping, centralised messing and modern labour-saving equipment.44. Considerable improvements have also been made in the quality of new furniture for barracks and married quarters. A number of clubs,sports-grounds, swimming-baths and N.A.AF.I. buildings are being constructed or modernised.45. The architectural staffs of the Services are making every effort toensure that new buildings are attractively designed, and that housing estatesare well planned, in accord with the best professional standards. where necessary, outside architects with special experience are brought into consultation.Expenditure46. Before deducting expected receipts of  12 millions from Germany,the Defence Estimates for 1959-60 amount to  1,514 millions. That is some 10 millions higher than the expected total of Estimates and Supplementariesfor 1958-59. The increase is more than accounted for by additional charges of various kinds, including about  14 millions for rises in industrial wagesand prices,  6 millions for improvements in allowances and pensionsrecommended by the Grigg Committee and  2 millions for the recent increasein Civil Service pay.11
