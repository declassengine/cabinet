(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 18 COPY NOt-7th February, 1959CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY; HORTICULTUREMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodIntroductionOn 3rd February the Prime Minister said that he would arrange for further consideration to be given to the desirability of adjusting certain horticultural tariffs in the light of the points made inour discussion (C.C.(59) 4th Conclusions, Minute 5).   The PrimeMinister has since invited me to circulate a further paper withparticular reference to the implications of an increase in the tariff on cut flowers and also to deal with the general aspects of the problems arising from the horticultural tariff.The immediate issue: cut flowers2.        The National Farmers1&apos; Unions (N.F.U.&apos;s) asked for increases of 50 per cent in the present tariff on roses, carnations, narcissi andanemones.   This sounds a big increase, but in most cases the existingrate is very low.   If, however, my colleagues feel that it would be easier to justify a smaller increase, I think an increase of one-thirdin present rates would be sufficient to help the industry and hold theposition.   The facts are as follows:-PresentRateper lb.R oses	1/8	8 -	9	2/6	12	- 14	2/3	11	- 12Carnations	1/8	13 -	29	2/6	20	- 38	2/3	17	- 26Narcissi, Polyanthus	4g-	8 -	s	7	12	- 14	6	11	- 12Anemones	1/8	25 -	30	2/6	37	- 45	2/3	33	- 40other Flowers	1/8			2/-			2/-		*-*AcN.F.U.TsValorem   RequestIncidence (50 perper cent    cent increase)AdValoremIncidenceper centMy newprop-proposals(334; percentincrease)AdValoremIncidenceper cent-1-
Such a compromise would damp down the indignation at what is thought to have been unjust rejection of the other applications;  and help todispel the serious doubts as to whether we are prepared to use thetariff at all to protect horticulture.The general problem: alternative methods of protection for horticulture3.        We have maintained in full agreement with the N.F.U.&apos;s formany years that tariffs are the most appropriate method of protectinghorticulture and meeting our undertakings under the 1947 Act.     ur recentrejection of a series of applications for tariff increases was decided oneconomic grounds. But even if these applications had been justified, theposition would have been embarrassing.   It therefore begins to look as iftariffs may be becoming a blunted weapon because of the difficulties whichthey lead to in our relations with Western Europe.   It does seem desirable,therefore, for us to have a look at other possible methods of assisting theindustry.   I must say immediately thai there is no simple and obviousalternative method.   There are serious difficulties about all alternativeswhich have been put forward. .None of them could be introduced withoutvery careful consideration,and negotiation which would take many months.But I do think we ought to carry out such a review.4.        Among the methods which have been suggested are thefollowing:-(a) Minimum price schemes under this system imports are automatically cut off whenprices here fall below a predetermined level.   Such schemes are alreadyused on the Continent for regulating imports of apples and a few other commodities.There is a good deal to be said for and against arrangements of this kind.   Much depends on whether they are practicable for theparticular product, and at what the level the cut off price is fixed.They are essentially a form of quantitative restriction and socontrary to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAJ.T,). We should therefore, have to secure the agreement of the other countries concerned,and we do not know whether such an agreement could be secured.I doubt if minimum price schemes are an alternative to increases in the tariffs for many horticultural commodities.   But I certainly donot rule out, without further study, the possibility that they might be useful for some.(b) A tariff varying with market pricesA specific tariff varying inversely with the market price ratherthan with the months of the home production season is an attractive ideain theory, but would present real practical difficulties for H.M.Customsat the ports of entry.   This is because the market prices of manyhorticultural products fluctuate widely and unpredictably fEonr week toweek and even from day to day and many of them are highly perishable.It would also be extremely difficult to negotiate such a tariff with ourco-signatories to the G.A.T.T.
(c) Extension of the periods in which the higher tariff rates applyTo extend the period over which the higher rate of tariffapplies is one way of raising the tariff.   Several of the applicationswhich we have just rejected - including those for broccoli and cauli-flower, new potatoes and tomatoes - contained this feature.   It is ofcourse open to producers to apply at any time for adjustments of thiskind;  but on the basis of our recent experience I doubt whether anygeneral solution to the problem is to be found along these lines.(d) A system of guaranteed pricesAlthough a system of guaranteed prices and assured markets,such as that which applies to the main agricultural products, could provide a solution to the problem in theory, the practical difficulties of applying it to horticultural products have previously been regarded asinsuperable.   Again, the main difficulties are the variety and perishabilityof the products and the rapid and unpredictable fluctuations in supply,demand and consequent market prices.Appendices5.

APPENDIX INOTE r&quot;N THE OPERATION OF THE HORTICULTURAL TARIFFThe structure of our horticultural tariff is designed to avoid the worst effects of gluts.   Yields and quality of horticultural cropsvary enormously both in the exporting countries and here, and consumerdemand fluctuates unpredictably. Therefore, in the main home marketingseasons we have, in general, adopted a system of specific tariffs (i. e.a fixed rate per pound of produce).   The great virtue of specific tariffsis that they are particularly effective when supplies are over-plentifuland prices consequently low;  and when supplies are scarce and priceshigh their effect on imports is less than ad valorem   tariffs.   In short,a specific tariff puts a bottom in the market..   2.        The tariff on each product is tailored to meet the particular problem.   Some apply throughout the year, others only for short periods.Some are at fixed rates while others vary during the season.   Theactual rates and the dates to which they apply are, however, in allcases fixed.   They are not varied to meet the special marketing problemsof any particular year.   Generally speaking, the object of the seasonaltariff is to give protection to the home producer during the main homemarketing season without impeding imports when these are needed.Some examples are given in the Annex to this Appendix.   &apos;3.        Between 1950 and 1954 the whole range of horticultural tariffs -unaltered since 1939 - was reviewed.   The rates were roughly doubledto take account of the fall in the value of money which had by thenrendered them of much reduced value.   Since then there have been nochanges;  and the continuing fall in the value of money has reduced the effective protection given by the specific duties.   In general theprotection is now less than before the war.   The average effective rate on all products throughout the year is probably about 15 per cent.-1-

APPENDIX IIThe Effect of Changes in Tomato Prices on theCost of Living Index1.      The National Farmers&apos; Union asked for an increase of2d. a pound in the duty on tomatoes from the middle ofJune to the end of October,  i.e. an increase from k&amp;.  apound to 6d.  a pound from mid-June to the end of August andfrom 2d.  a pound to i+d.  a pound for September and October.It is impossible to say to what extent an increase of 2d.a pound in the tariff would result in an increase in retail prices,  but the probability is that not the wholeof the increase in the duty would be reflected in retail prices.2.      An increase of 2d.  a pound in the retail price oftomatoes in the home production season (roughly   from may to October) would raise the All Items Index by between0.05 points and 0.06 points according to the range ofother vegetables in season,  the effect being greatest inJune/July and lowest in August.    The effect on the FoodIndex would be from 0.15 to 0.17 points.

APPENDIX IVPROFITABILITY OF TOMATO AND FLOWER PRODUCTIONStatistical information on which direct measurements of changes in profitability could be made is not available.2.Costs have certainly risen substantially since the lastadjustment in the tariff in 1954*    For tomatoes and cut flowersgrown under glass, the increase is estimated to be over 30%.Costs of solid fuels have risen by 34% to 40%* according to typeWage-rates have risen by 22%.    These two items account for nearly three quarters of the total cost of production.3.       Average yields per acre have remained stable.4.       Prices of tomatoes have risen much less than costs since1954&apos; when the present tariff was introduced:    since 1956 theyhave actually declined.    Average prices for the United Kingdomgiven by the Tomato and Cucumber Marketing Board are:Prices of flowers must also have fallen (records of them have&quot;been kept) since the annual value of the crops has declined,although the areas under production have increased (seeAppendix III&quot;) .195 5per lb.&apos; 1/0*1956per lb.1/31957per lb.1/21958per lb.1/1 i
APPENDIX VINFLUENCE OF HOME PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS ON PRICES OPTOMATOES AND CUT FLOWERS1 .      It is characteristic of both these commodities that the demand at any given time is inelastic.      Relatively small increases in supplies are thus capable of causing much larger reductions inprices.2.      During the main season for tomatoes Holland is the principalforeign supplier.      Holland also exports to other countries,particularly to Germany, which country also imports from Italy andcertain countries of Eastern Europe.    Demand on Dutch exports varieswith supplies to Germany from these other sources;    and if it fallsthe tendency is to ship more to the United Kingdom.3.      These considerations,  together with the short haul from Hollandto the United Kingdom, and the intimate relations between Dutchexporters and British importers, mean that there is close sympathybetween prices in Holland and in London.      If TJ.K.  supplies slackenthe slack is promptly taken up by Holland, and price movements are limited.      If supplies in Holland increase (because, for instance,the German market is glutted) and prices weaken, additional exportscome to the United Kingdom, whose prices fall at once to the Dutchlevel.i-U Imports from Holland thus exercise a decisive influence on prices for the United Kingdom crop.5.      The market for cut flowers is more restricted and selective.    the arrival of imports on a slightly larger scale than usual often leads,to a dull market for a period.    Owing to the variety of flowers andthe number of sources of supply it is not possible to assessaccurately the effect of imports on prices.
APPENDIX VIEMPLOYMENT IN HORTICULTURE AND ITS GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION1.      Reliable figures for the total employment in horticulture inthe United Kingdom are not available.      It is estimated however that there are about 150 ,000 growers and workers in England andWales , who are dependent for their living wholly or mainly on.horticulture, with perhaps a further 5*000 to 10,000 in Scotland andNorthern Ireland combined.2.      In every county in England and Wales, there are somehorticultural holdings:    they are fewest in the northern counties ofEngland, and in Wales (except for Monmouth and Glamorgan).3.     Around all the main centres of population there are considerable numbers of holdings devoted to general market garden production.In the non-urban districts production is more specialised.k.
