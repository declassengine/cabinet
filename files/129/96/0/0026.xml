It is issued for the personal use of............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (59) 2613th February, 1959CABINETGUY BURGESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsItems appear in the Press from time to time to the effect that Guy Burgesswishes to return to the United Kingdom and, in particular, would try to do so if his mother became seriously ill. My colleagues will no doubt wish to know what possibilities there are of this happening and what could be done about it.2. As Burgess has not formally renounced his British nationality and has notbeen convicted of any offence, his present status is that of any other British subjectresident abroad. If, therefore, he arrived at a port or airport in the UnitedKingdom and could prove that he was a citizen of the United Kingdom (whichhe should have no difficulty in doing) there is no law or regulation under whichwe could refuse him entry. Similarly, if he applied to Her Majesty&apos;s embassy in Moscow for a travel document, we could hardly refuse him an emergencycertificate to enable him to come home, particularly if he claimed that his motherwas dying.3. His mother, Mrs. Bassett, is over 70 and is undoubtedly in failing health.It is difficult to judge from the information at our disposal whether her conditionwill suddenly deteriorate, but this must be regarded as a distinct possibility. we know that Burgess is particularly attached to his mother and we have grounds for believing that he is becoming more and more anxious to come here to see her.4. We have no means of knowing whether the Soviet authorities would try to prevent his departure, but I do not believe that they would.5. In December 1957 the Attorney-General advised that the available evidence was insufficient to support a charge under Section I of the Official SecretsAot (1911) and that, in the circumstances of this case, he would not consider giving his consent to a minor charge under Section II.6. If Burgess returned to the United Kingdom, and was not prosecuted,Her Majesty&apos;s Government might be considerably embarrassed, particularly as(a) the general tenor of the Report Concerning the Disappearance of Burgess andMaclean (issued as a White Paper, September 1955) was that both men were spies,and (b) this general impression was confirmed by Ministerial statements in theHouse of Commons debate on 7th November, 1955.S.
