(59) 37 Copy No.25th February, 1959CABINETAID FOR BRITISH PROPERTY OWNERS IN EGYPTNote by Minister of State for Foreign affairs at the request of the Lord Privy Seal I am circulating the attached minuteon the forms of aid which might be given to property owners in Egypt in.order toassist them to recover their property following the Financial Agreement.J. D. P.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,25th February, 1959.54799
CARRYING OUT THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN FINANCIAL agreement in a -minute of 12th January to Sir Frederick Hoyer Millar, Permanent Under -Secretary of State, the Prime Minister directed that the organisation to be set upto advise British property owners after the Agreement should be on the lines ofa &quot; Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau &quot; and asked us to discuss the possibilities of free legal advice and indemnities against legal costs to claimants. The Prime Ministerreverted to this in a minute to the Foreign Secretary of 18th January, saying thata great deal would depend upon a proper and generously managed organisation,and that it would be much better to deal generously with the claimants from the start.2. In his minute to the Prime Minister of 13th January Sir Frederick HoyerMillar described the arrangements we had made in the Foreign Office and said wewere going further into the question of free legal advice and indemnities fromlegal costs. Since then extra staff has been taken on, and Sir George Rendel, a former senior Ambassador, will be in charge of the advice bureau in the british property in Egypt Section. Additional office space at 7 Carlton Gardens has beentaken over and painted up to present a decent appearance to the public.3. The arrangements which are in hand should now be adequate to meetthe real needs of the property owners, but this is not to say that these arrangements will necessarily be enough politically to meet the demands of the refugees, andthose of their sponsors, especially in the House of Lords.4.   The sort of points the refugees&apos; sponsors may raise are:-  -(a) return fares to Egypt ought to be paid by Her Majesty&apos;s Government(especially as we advanced many fares at the time of the exodus andhave since allowed money spent on fares by those who paid their ownto be refunded to them);(b) many property owners, especially those who do not want to go back to egypt, cannot afford to pay agents, and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould either authorise our Mission in Cairo to act on behalf ofclaimants, or at least subsidise Toplis and Harding (the commercialagents we propose to recommend to owners); free legal aid might be demanded under this head;(c) a more extreme version of (b) might be put forward, i.e., in the caseparticularly of those who do not want their property, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should take it over, realise it and pay compensation to theowners.5. These points have all been considered, and at the official level the treasury are not anxious to entertain proposals of this kind involving further expenditure.The point is whether it is desirable to meet some or all of these criticisms in advance by expenditure which lies outside the competence of the Foreign Office and maynot seem strictly necessary at present, but which might, as the Prime minister suggested in his minute, prove a good investment.6. On the three points mentioned in paragraph 4 above, the pros and consare as follows(a) FaresOfficials have no cause to recommend payment of return fares to egypt. The circumstances are quite different from those in which weadvanced fares to those leaving Egypt at short notice en masse. But theoffer of fares would be a political gesture which, if announced at the outset, would look generous and cost comparatively little.(b) Agents&apos; ExpensesThis may well prove a real problem for some owners who do not wish to return, and for the poorer claimants.  Toplis and Harding will
not be cheap. (Representatives of the refugees have already put themore extreme proposition that a Board be set up in Cairo with an officialchairman and representatives of the property owners to take overproperty, realise it where necessary, and deal with the egyptian authorities on behalf of owners. They would expect us to pay for this.)It would be possible to meet some or all of the expenses of Toplis andHarding from public funds, but the Treasury have so far been unwilling to consider any subsidy unless we could show that the arrangements would otherwise be plainly inadequate which we cannot say inadvance.(c) Proposals as extreme as (c) or the idea of a Refugee Board in Cairo can probably be resisted, especially if something is done under the otherheads, at least under (a).7. The Prime Minister also spoke of free legal advice and aid. Under the heading of advice we shall meet two of the owners&apos; main needs :(i) advice on how the Agreement affects individuals can be dispensed by theBritish Property in Egypt Section in London, after consulting ifnecessary the Foreign Office Legal Advisers concerned; and(ii) advice on the application of the Agreement in Egypt can be dispensedthrough the Property Office in Cairo, which will be able to call uponthe services of its Legal Adviser.On (i) it has also been suggested that a part-time legal expert (not an official)on Egyptian law be appointed to advise the British Property in Egypt Section inLondon, and a candidate is in mind. It is, however, not yet certain that such an appointment is necessary. Advice based on Egyptian law can best be dispensedin Cairo, where claimants will be able to call upon both our Legal Adviser andalso Toplis and Harding, who will obtain their own local legal advice. We may,however, have to reconsider this in the light of experience, in which case I would hope the Chancellor of the Exchequer would agree to the necessary fee being paid.8. Free legal aid suggests, in addition, meeting costs of litigation. TheAgreement provides for all compensation claims to be directed against the lump sum in our hands, not against the Egyptians. So there is no question of legal aid being needed for compensation claims against the Egyptians. Although therecan be no cause for action against Her Majesty&apos;s Government some disgruntledproperty owners may &quot; try it on.&quot; Presumably there can be no question of her majesty&apos;s Government encouraging ill-founded litigation against themselves by offering to pay the expenses. There will, however, be possibilities of litigation withthe Egyptians in connexion with tax claims and other disputes arising from theperiod prior to desequestration, which may not be covered by the Agreement.It would not be unreasonable to expect owners to pay their own expenses forthese and indeed it would be undesirable to encourage litigation by offering tofoot all bills. Thus, provided we can say that legal advice will be dispensed inLondon and Cairo on the implementation of the Agreement, our position shouldbe defensible.9. To sum up, we can hope to meet the legitimate needs of the refugeesunder the arrangements already in hand, but these may not meet politicalcriticisms, especially as the whole Agreement is bound to come under fire among other things for the apparent inadequacy of the lump sum compensation. Itmight therefore be a good investment to offer from the outset to pay fares(paragraph 4 (a) above). It would also be a very useful political gesture to paysomething towards Agents&apos; expenses (paragraph 4 (b) above). I am not sure whether it is really necessary to do anything further at present about legal adviceor aid (paragraph 7 above).10. In the Prime Ministers absence, I think a ministerial decision isnecessary whether money should be made available under any of these heads, inwhich case a ministerial directive would be required in order that my officials canformulate more precise proposals with the Treasury.11. I am sending a copy of this minute to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Lord President of the Council, the Chief Whip, and to the Prime MinistersPrivate Secretary.
