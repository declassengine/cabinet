CABINETto,SERVICE WIDOWS&apos; pensions memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerA difficulty has arisen about a recommendation of the Advisory Committeeon Recruiting, under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg (which we have accepted),that in future Service widows should receive one-third of the husband&apos;s pension on a non-contributory basis. It is agreed that this should apply to the futurewidows of men now serving: but the Minister of Defenc wishes to apply it alsoto the future widows of existing Service pensioners, and to make someimprovements for existing widows.2. Although in many ways the Armed Forces can be distinguished from other public employment, improvements for widows of men who are no longer in theForces are in my judgment dangerous because of the repercussions on other publicservice pensioners and on war widows.Existing Service Widows3. Many of them draw very small pensions. But so do large numbers ofother public service pensioners. Moreover, before 1949, officers&apos; widows werethe only public service widows to get any pension at all. If existing Service widowsare now given better pensions, there is no knowing where the concession would lead since the whole pensions front is so sensitive. There are the men themselvesnow on pension from the Armed Forces and the other public services. There arealso various campaigns, one for public service pensioners generally, another forretired teachersiwhose widows have no widows&apos; pension scheme at all), and anotherfor retired mine workers (where a concession might provoke a claim from the railwaymen). In addition the ex-Service organisations are pressing for improvements for war widows (which the proposed concession would makeexceedingly difficult to resist), with possible repercussions in the industrial injuriesand national assistance fields. The list is formidable, and so is the money at stake.For example, if a 10 per cent, increase were given to existing Service widows andthen had to be conceded to other public service pensioners the cost would be of theorder of  10 millions a year, and even this does not include the cost of repercussions on war widows.Future Widows of Existing Pensioners4. In my view, future widows of existing pensioners could be brought in only if something had been done for existing widows. Otherwise we should have tojustify giving an increase to the widow whose husband happened to die after somearbitrary date, and refusing it to the widow whose husband died a little sooner,although both men retired at the same time with identical contracts. moreover the wider repercussions exist here also: the teachers, for example, would quicklyseize any opportunity for pressing their claims.54562SECRET&amp; (59) 29th January, -1959PrihtedJdHheCiibinet:- Tanuary 1959
conclusion. The whole pensions front is so explosive at the moment that, althoughall the repercussions cannot;ibe, qreta^ of a costlychain reaction points to the conclusion that the Grigg Committee^ recommendations should be applied only to the future widows of men now serving. After all theGrigg Committee were concerned with means of improving regular recruiting andthey ^themselves recognise (paragraph 119 of their Report) that &quot; the; scale of benefits under a family pension scheme has no direct effect on initial recruitment and little impact on re-engagement.&quot; vvtwai  &apos;-;d. h. a:Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th January, 1959. -SECRET
