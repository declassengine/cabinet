SECRET3A.-BERLIN, GERMANY AND EUROPEAN SECURITYFirst Full Discussion (22nd February)The Soviet Prime Minister, Mr. Khruschev, said that the Soviet Governmentinsisted upon their position in Germany, which was well known. Any attempt tosettle the question of European security by means of German reunification throughfree election was bound to fail. The two States with completely different systemswere a fact. If Britain was prepared to recognise that East Germany existedand would probably develop along Socialist lines, the difficulties might be settled;he welcomed the statement of the Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, that free electionswere not the only way to reunification, and thought this gave some hope of asettlement. If the existence of two States were recognised, a peace treaty mightbe a way out. As regards Berlin, the Free City of West Berlin should be guaranteedby the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Statesof America, France and the United Nations; there could be observers and perhapsforces of the four powers to see that the guarantees were kept.2. The Soviet Government wanted to separate out the problems. TheWestern proposals looked like an attempt to draw them all together and startnegotiations which might last for years. Berlin was in the Soviet Zone and thepresent system was only valid pending a peace treaty. If West Germanyrefused a peace treaty, the Soviet Government would conclude one with EastGermany. This would bring the occupation and the legal position based on itto an end.3. In reply to questions, Mr. Khruschev said that the three Western alliesmight keep forces for police purposes in West Berlin when it became a free city;so would the Russians. They could not be in East Berlin because that was thecapital of East Germany. Another possibility might be to have forces from neutralcountries. Any forces should be of token strength, and the Soviet Union shouldhave a quarter of the total if allied forces were present; but access to Berlin couldnot be guaranteed by such forces; it would be guaranteed iby an agreement betweenthe powers concerned and registered with the United Nations. This agreementcould provide for sanctions against violators. In the Soviet view, as thearrangements would relate to the sovereign territory of the DeutscheDemokratische Republik (D.D.R.), the East German Government might makea declaration, registered with the United Nations, with which the four Governmentswould be associated; the declaration would guarantee access for all countries withwhich West Berlin wanted it. West Berlin could not belong to West Germany.4. On reunification, Mr. Khruschev said that the West Germans mightaccept the proposal for a confederation and the establishment of an all-GermanGovernment on the basis of parity. This relationship might develop into the singlegovernment of a unitary state. Its system might be that now prevailing either inEast or West Germany; the main thing was that there should be no interference.There could be free elections on the Western model, provided that these came aboutthrough development and agreement amongst the Germans themselves.5. The Prime Minister said that if the Soviet position was indeed asMr. Khruschev had described it, the situation was very dangerous. The PrimeMinister and Foreign Secretary insisted throughout that nothing Khruschev coulddo would extinguish our right of access to Berlin and our determination to do ourduty by staying there. A peace treaty between the Soviet Union and East Germanycould not relieve the Soviet Union of their obligations or affect our rights. Wethought, moreover, that we should work towards a solution of the whole problem;it would be very difficult to deal with particular aspects of it.Discussion on Disarmament (23rd February)6. In the course of a discussion on disarmament, Mr. Khruschev said that theSoviet draft peace treaty could be amended. Instead of the two parts of Germanyleaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and the Warsaw Pact,West Germany could stay in N.A.T.O. and East Germany in the Warsaw Pact fora period.54849SECRET
4SECRETConversation Between the Foreign Secretary and Mr. Gromyko (24th February)7. Mr. Gromyko described West Berlin as. a cancer in the heart of EastGermany. Because of espionage and assistance to subversive activities, thecontinuance of the Status quo was&apos;impossible. After repeating the Soviet proposals,he then said that under them the rights of access to Berlin would be much morestrongly safeguarded than at present; it would be a solemn undertaking of the SovietUnion which they would not dream of repudiating. In reply to a question, hesaid that West Berlin could not remain part of West Germany in the sense that itsent members to the Bundestag; its status would be quite different.Second Full Discussion (25th February)8. The Prime Minister referred to the proposal in Mr. Khruschev&apos;s speech ofthe previous day for a meeting of Heads of Government. Whatever the level andother arrangements of a conference, he was convinced that there must benegotiations soon and that matters must not be allowed to drift into whitMr. Khruschev had called &quot; a dangerous situation.&quot; It was his duty to say thatthe British Government would stand by and co-operate with their Western allies.He could do nothing to promote peace unless he acted in a sincere and truthfulmanner and could be of no use unless he acted loyally towards the UnitedKingdom&apos;s friends and allies.9. Mr. Khruschev had listed subjects for negotiation: European Security,the withdrawal of forces from foreign territories, the disposal of armed forces oneach side, disarmament, arms limitation, the banning of atomic and hydrogenweapons and the control of nuclear tests. These important questions could not besolved in two or three days; but some of them could be solved by a process ofnegotiation.10. Mr. Khruschev replied that he did not understand the West&apos;s position;their reply to the Soviet proposals had borne no relation to them. Why did theywish to preserve the dangerous situation in Berlin? Was it because they wereplanning for war? Was this the reason for the rearmament of West Germany?The Soviet aim was to negotiate, stabilise the situation and get a peace treatysigned. They would conclude a treaty with the D.D.R. and any other countrywhich would join in, even if the West would have no part in it. If the West wishedto maintain a state of war, the responsibility was on them. Moreover, after thepeace treaty had been signed, any infringement of the territorial integrity of theD.D.R. would be followed by war.11. Mr. Khruschev then said that if the West did not like 27th May as adate, let them name another in June or July. There was no time limit. If, as thePrime Minister had claimed, West Berlin was of no importance to the West fromthe military point of view, why did they want to keep troops there? The PrimeMinister replied that we had both a right and a duty to do so. His concern was torind a solution, honourable to both sides, which would preserve Our rights andenable us to carry out our duties.12. Mr. Khruschev repeated his offer to guarantee the status of a free city,send Soviet troops as a token force to join the Western troops in West Berlinand guarantee Western access. They were willing to consider any other proposals.But the original Soviet proposals did no harm to the West Berliners. He did nottherefore understand why we talked about our duty to them and suggested alabyrinth of extraneous talk. Meanwhile the Soviet Government would not bedeflected, and if a peace treaty were signed, all agreements resulting from thecapitulation and occupation of Germany would come to an end.13. When the Prime Minister insisted that the future of Berlin, Germanreunification and European security were all matters which must be solved bynegotiation and not by threats or pressure, Mr. Khruschev said that the SovietUnion had proposed a clear agenda on which to negotiate. The West had repliedwith a vague agenda, featuring the reunification of Germany. The SovietGovernment did not want discussion in such a vague framework as &quot; the Germanquestion in all its aspects.&quot; They wanted a peace treaty. It was no good for theWest just to reject every proposal put to them. If that happened, the SovietGovernment could only act as they had said they would.SECRET

Referring to the discussion; ,qn 25th February, Mr. Khruschev said hewished to say in all seriousness that the Sdp^:.Qpyep|flaen.t m|fenqi &amp; to carry thething through.

They wereto part, in a worse spirit than the one m which the two sides had met, bU^^ti}^United Kingdom side had created this situation by the talk of the day before., ThePrime Minister replied that Mr, Khruschev wished to conclude a German peacetreaty, but himself admitted that this led to a dangerous situation. If such asituation existed, we must deal with it by negotiation. These frank exchanges hadbeen useful; he hoped Mr. Khruschev would consider what he had said.15. Mr. Khruschev asked how the conclusion of a peace treaty could bedangerous. The West were planning the liquidation of Socialism in Eastern Europeand wanted to consolidate capitalism throughout the world rather than serve thecause of peace. He welcomed our desire for negotiation, which the SovietGovernment shared; but it was not in keeping with our threats.Conversation between the Foreign Secretary and Mr. Gromyko (1st March)16. The Soviet Foreign Secretary, Mr. Gromyko, said that the SovietGovernment had favoured Sir Anthony Eden&apos;s proposals on European security,and had been interested in the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks on 22nd February (seeparagraph 26). The Secretary of State suggested that, as regards the question ofthe level of a conference, the Foreign Ministers might perhaps meet immediatelybefore the Heads of Government and again afterwards when the main points hadbeen established. He also wondered whether the juridical question of Westernrights in Berlin could be settled by the International Court.Fourth full discussion (2nd March)17. Mr. Khruschev made it clear that what he really wanted was for the Westto accept the existence of East Germany with its present frontiers. He said thathe was not interested in de jure recognition. If we would not sign a peace, treatywith the D.D.R., some formula could perhaps be found whereby we would recognisethe frontiers de facto, possibly through a third Power, always assuming that a PeaceTreaty had been concluded between the Soviet Union and the D.D.R. There wouldbe no need for West Germany to recognise East Germany de jure.18. On Berlin he repeated that the date of 27th May had no particularsignificance. It could be any date we liked to name. He also repeated his assuranceabout full guarantees for access if West Berlin became a free city. (He implied thatthe idea of a free city in West Berlin had occurred to the Soviet Government whenthey were working out their ideas for a Peace Treaty with the two Germanys, asthe only means of solving the anomolous position of West Berlin which wouldthen arise.)19. The Prime Minister suggested that the main theme of the discussions hadbeen the need for negotiation. He thought some points had been identified onwhich negotiation could lead to progress. If we could settle some of these, theothers would be easier to deal with. Mr. Khruschev agreed.20. The Prime Minister also pointed out the difficulties of reaching agreementon major issues at a short Summit meeting. He suggested that a Summit meetingcombined with meetings of Foreign Ministers or other negotiators might achieveresults. Mr. Khruschev said that he agreed; he was not out for a Summit meeting at allcosts. Finally he said that he was not trying to put pressure on anyone, but thequestions of Germany and Berlin were ripe for settlement and he was only askingfor the position which had now arisen to be fixed and accepted.21. The Soviet draft proposal for a bilateral Pact of Non-Aggression andFriendship was also discussed. The Prime Minister felt that a Treaty of this kindwould be more appropriate later on if it could crown the success of the negotiations;it could then be concluded on a multilateral basis. He was ready, however, as agesture of encouragement to sign a joint Anglo-Soviet declaration which would: -(a) reaffirm the intention of both Governments to act in the spirit and the letterof the United Nations Charter; jSECRET54849 b 2
6SECRET(b) declare that neither would seek unilaterally to prejudice the rights,obligations or vital interests of the other;Ac) declare that, on this basis, disputes should be settled by negotiation andnot by force.Mr. Khruschev showed interest but wished to see a reference to elimination offoreign bases. He would also like an agreement renouncing verbal aggression.The Prime Minister, while rejecting the first suggestion, considered that the secondmight be taken up in the talks on cultural matters.B.-DISARMAMENT, NUCLEAR TESTS, SURPRISE ATTACK ANDDISENGAGEMENTFirst Full Discussion (22nd February)22. The Foreign Secretary opened by saying that if agreement could bereached on nuclear tests, it would point the way to other agreements. He thenoutlined the Western position on control posts, inspection teams and the Sovietconception of the veto. Mr. Khruschev replied that the Soviet position derivedfrom the fact that there was so little trust between East and Wesit; he could notagree to steps which would allow the other side to become the masters in Sovietterritory. Complaints could always be thought up and inspection pushed througheven where there was nothing to inspect; the Soviet Government would be stupidto accept such a system. He thought, however, that agreement could be reachedon the personnel of control posts, which should be mixed. He was also preparedto agree to flights by aircraft to take air samples with indigenous pilots andnavigators; the technicians could be from other countries. But ground inspectionwould merely be an intelligence operation and would be unacceptable.23. The Foreign Secretary pointed out that control posts and air-samplingflights alone would not detect underground tests. Mr. Khruschev seemed impressedby this point and said that the Soviet Union was particularly interested in thecontrol of underground tests; they themselves were not making small tacticalnuclear weapons.24. It was agreed that an agreement on nuclear tests alone did not touchthe fundamentals of disarmament, but that it might, by creating a better atmosphereof trust, open up the way to real disarmament measures.25. The Foreign Secretary referred to the possibility of control over the useof fissile material for weapons purposes. Mr. Khruschev said that this would beimpossible without a ban on the use of nuclear weapons. The Foreign Secretaryqueried this and urged that such control would be the best means of stoppingfurther Powers developing nuclear weapons. Mr. Khruschev expressed interestin a further examination of this possibility.26. The Foreign Secretary then said that there might be certain areas inwhich one could have a controlled limitation of armaments of all kinds.Mr. Khruschev said that the Soviet Union would be prepared to go quite a longway on that. We should try to disengage our forces. The further apart we went,the greater the area of disengagement and the more thorough the inspection ofthat area could be. The Prime Minister said he thought the technique of inspectionneeded study. We could perhaps learn it in a small way and then apply it in awider field.   Mr. Khruschev agreed.Second Full Discussion (23rd February)27. The Foreign Secretary outlined the general Western position ondisarmament. Mr. Khruschev said that the Soviet Union wanted disarmament;the arms race was a senseless waste of money. The question was how to approachit. He was sceptical of the 82-member United Nations Disarmament Committee;in his view only Heads of Governments could settle the question. If they couldset the ball rolling, it should not take too long to get things worked out. The SovietUnion would accept a level of one million men, or a lower figure, if it were thesame for the other side. In fact they would give up armed forces altogether andhave only a militia for internal security.  Then there could be full control. TheSECRET
SECRETSoviet Union had no intention of1 using its -nuclear advantage tot attack the West;let the Heads of Government work out the&apos;principles and give a directive totheir Foreign MinisterisU &lt;jiafcd tiAl28. The Prime Minister doubted whether Heads of Government could reachagreement on, these complex problems jn a short conference, .Jit ..would, be, j betterto move from such agreements to greater; to start with nuclear tests, ^rqn,.||^surprise attack and thence perhaps to the limitation and&apos; control of. ar maments&quot; iivsome big or small area in Europe. This might lead to. some&apos; ;much, greaterdevelopment later.  Mr. Khruschev agreed.29. On surprise attack, the Foreign Secretary explained the West&apos;s preferencefor technical discussions first, and Mr. Khruschev the Soviet view that the matterwas primarily political. The Prime Minister pointed out that before a plan forcontrol of certain areas could be agreed, Mr. Khruschev would wish to know theoutline of the system and how it would work. Mr. Khruschev replied that theessential point was the weapons at the disposal of both sides; he recalled the Sovietoffer to reduce troops in Europe by a fixed proportion on both sides; if this weredone, there could be complete control in the area involved. He concluded that thetwo sides were far part; perhaps a start should be made somewhere else.Conversation between the Foreign Secretary and Mr. Gromyko (24th February)30. On nuclear tests, Mr. Gromyko said that it was essential that somenationals of the country inspected should be members of the team; otherwise theywould not know whether the team was merely spying. On surprise attack, theForeign Secretary said that if our plan had been followed and agreement reachedon system, it would have been much easier to select areas, because the Governmentsconcerned would know exactly what they were being committed to.31. Mr. Gromyko also expressed interest in the possibility of limitingarmaments in a restricted area.C.-CULTURAL RELATIONS32. Useful discussions were held on the cultural relations between the UnitedKingdom and the Soviet Union, and agreement was reached on some expansionof these relations.D.-TRADE RELATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS33. The state of Anglo-Soviet trade and other outstanding matters concerningAnglo-Soviet relations were also discussed. It was agreed to send a missionheaded by a British Minister for detailed talks on expansion of trade.E.-THE COMMUNIQUE34.  The Communique issued at the conclusion of the visit is at the Appendix.5 th March, 1959.SECRET
8SECRETAPPENDIXANGLO-SOVIET COMMUNIQUEAt the invitation of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,Mr. Harold Macmillan, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accompanied byMr. Selwyn Lloyd, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and official adviserspaid a return official visit to the Soviet Union  from 21st February to3rd March, 1959.In the course of their visit Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Selwyn Lloyd have hadthe opportunity to hold a series of discussions with Mr. N. S. Khruschev, theChairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,and other members of the Soviet Government, including Mr. A. I. Mikoyan, theFirst Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Mr. A. A. Gromyko, theMinister of Foreign Affairs.These discussions have ranged over some of the more important questionswhich are currently of general international concern. Both sides, however, tookaccount of the fact that these questions concern many countries other than theSoviet Union and the United Kingdom. Although they did not hold negotiations,the Prime Ministers have been able, in the course of their discussions during thepast ten days, to hold a valuable exchange of views on these questions. They havetaken advantage of this to explain their attitude, and the reasons underlying it,on a]j the questions discussed. The free interchange of views and ideas whichhas taken place has created a better understanding of the respective attitudes ofthe two Governments, and has thereby made a useful contribution towards theforthcoming international discussions in a wider circle.The Prime Ministers agreed that an advance towards a solution of the problemof disarmament would be a major contribution to the maintenance of peace. Itwould help to increase international confidence and to reduce the burden of militaryexpenditure.  They agreed to continue their efforts to make progress in this field.Their common objective remains the ultimate prohibition of nuclear weaponsand the application of nuclear energy solely to peaceful purposes.They recognised, however, the great importance of achieving agreement tostop nuclear weapons tests under an effective system of international inspection andcontrol. They reviewed the course of the work of the Geneva Conference on theDiscontinuance of Nuclear Weapons Tests and resolved to continue their effortsto reach a satisfactory agreement. They considered that such an agreement wouldreduce tension, would eliminate the possible danger to health and life resulting fromnuclear weapons tests, and would help to avert the further development of nuclearweapons.The Prime Minister exchanged full explanations of the views held by theirrespective Governments on questions relating to Germany including a peace treatywith Germany and the question of Berlin. They were unable to agree about thejuridical and political aspects of the problems involved. At the same time theyrecognised that it was of great importance for the maintenance and consolidationof peace and security in Europe and throughout the world that these problemsshould be urgently settled. They therefore acknowledged the need for earlynegotiations between the interested Governments, to establish a basis for thesettlement of these differences. They considered that such negotiations could laythe foundations for a stable system of European security. In this connexion theyagreed that further study could usefully be made of the possibilities of increasingsecurity by some method of limitation of forces and weapons, both conventionaland nuclear, in an agreed area of Europe, coupled with an appropriate system ofinspection.In relation to all these matters the Prime Ministers endorsed the principle thatdifferences between nations should be resolved by negotiation and not by force.They recognised that, if such negotiations were to succeed, it was important thateach side should make a sincere endeavour to understand the point of view of theother. They agreed that the present visit of British Prime Minister and ForeignSecretary to the Soviet Union had made a valuable contribution towards such anunderstanding.SECRET
SECRET9The Prime Ministers also discussed a number of particular questions which areof direct concern to the Governments of:the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.They took note with approval of a report by representatives of the twoGovernments on the development of e^c|ianges ii| tfye cultural field. This report isattached as an annex to this&apos; communique^ ;&apos;They also reviewed the state of Anglo-Soviet trade. They noted withsatisfaction that the long-term trend of* trade between the two countries was upwardand that there was scope f Or increasing this trade&apos;/ They agreed that a mission iMby a United Kingdom Minister should visit the Soviet Union in the nearfiitEireibinvestigate the scope for further trade in more! detail than was possible&apos;during thepresent talks.The Prime Ministers expressed their confidence that the personal contactswhich had been established between the Heads of Governments of the Soviet Unionand of the United Kingdom would be continued in the interests of the developmentof friendship and co-operation between the peoples of the two countries, as well asin the interests of preservation and consolidation of universal peace.HAROLD MACMILLAN,Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.N. KHRUSCHEV^Chairman of the Council of Ministersof the U.S.S.R.Moscow, 3rd March, 1959.AnnexAGREEMENT ON CULTURAL EXCHANGESThe Representatives of the two countries reviewed the progress achieved infulfilling on an increasing scale programmes of exchanges in the cultural fieldenvisaged in the 1956 Joint Declaration on this subject.They agreed to continue their joint efforts for the development of relationsalong the lines established in that Declaration and also by the promotion of futureexchanges in the fields of industry and agriculture. They agreed that interchangeof people and knowledge on this basis is leading towards greater mutualunderstanding, friendship and peace between the British and Soviet peoples. Theynoted with satisfaction that representatives of the Soviet Relations Committee ofthe British Council will come to Moscow in the second half of March to reachagreement with the State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countriesof the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., with the participation of the appropriatebodies concerned, on a programme for the coming year of cultural, educational,scientific and technical exchanges between the U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdomand they expressed the hope that the two Committees would seek to establish abasis of such programmes for a longer period ahead.In this connexion the representatives of the two Governments agreed to invitethe television and film interests in their respective countries to consider in aconstructive spirit on a basis of mutual advantage the purchase from each otheron a commercial basis and on an increasing scale of films and television material.It was also agreed that representatives of each Government should meet atintervals of not more than a year alternately in London and Moscow to reviewprogress and discuss further developments in the whole field of cultural relationsbetween the two countries.SECRET
