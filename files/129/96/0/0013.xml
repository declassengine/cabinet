Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1959C. (59) 13 Copy No.   5430th January, 1959CABINETHORTICULTURE : TARIFF ON CUT FLOWERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited by the Cabinet to arrange for the Economic Policy Committee to reconsider, in the light of the report of the Tariff Advisory Committee (T.A.C.),the desirability of an increase in the tariff on cut flowers (C.C. (59) 2nd Conclusions,Minute 7).2. The Committee have examined the T.A.C. report, which contains a careful analysis of the domestic merits of the application for an increase in thetariff: it pays no regard to other implications of increasing the duty against foreignsuppliers.3. The report finds that the home production of the flowers named in theapplication, with the possible exception of anemones (which have been affectedby disease), has expanded steadily since the last increase in duties in 1954; andthat, while imports also have increased, the evidence does not suggest that theyhave been harmful to home production.4. We reviewed in detail the evidence in the T.A.C. report, and also tookinto account production and import figures which have become available since it was submitted. The majority of us take the view that the T.A.C. were justifiedin finding that the economic case for increasing the tariff had not been made out.Our reasons, briefly, are (a) We recognise that the tariff is the Government^ main weapon for theprotection of the horticultural industry. But, even so, we do not feel that its use can be justified unless it can be shown both that a reasonably efficient grower is unable to make a living without theprotection of a higher tariff and that the decline in profitability which prevents him from making a living it due to the impact of imports onthe domestic market.(b) On the evidence available we do not feel that the application satisfies thesetests. The report shows that, expressed as a percentage of totalmarketings in the United Kingdom, foreign imports of cut flowers andother flowers in bloom were, by value, only 6-1 per cent, in 1956-57(compared with 6-4 per cent, in 1938-39). More recent figures tendto show that the volume of imports has remained virtually static: their value has increased sharply. This, coupled with such import trendsas can be established, suggests that foreign suppliers only come intothe United Kingdom market when prices are sufficiently high to assurethem of a good return. They hold off when prices are low. It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that it is the home, and not the imported product, which determines the domestic selling price;and that the recent increase in the value of imports, coupled with anear-static volume, shows that home producers should have had theopportunity, latterly, to benefit from higher prices.id) An increase in the tariff would not, on the above analysis, decisivelyassist the industry.54675THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
(d) Foreign competition in cut flowers, based on the better organised industries in Continental countries, is bound to increase sharply in the next fewyears. To raise the tariff now would tend to shelter the home industryinstead of spurring it to increase its efficiency. The recently announcedscheme for grant assistance should have a good effect in this direction.,5. The Minister of Agriculture and the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, Home Office, dissent from these views. They consider that there is aneconomic case for granting the application. Their reasons may be summarisedas follows (a) The use of the tariff in the field of horticulture should be regarded asbeing governed by the special consideration that horticulture is part ofagriculture, as defined in the Agriculture Act, 1947, and that successive governments have pledged themselves to use the tariff for theprotection of the industry.(b) The ad valorem incidence of the specific tariffs on roses, polyanthus andnarcissi has turned out to be well below the 10 per cent, general duty^ which would have applied had there been no special tariff.(c) The increase in the production of roses and carnations since 1954 is dueto the fact that tomato growers have switched part of their glasshousespace to these two flowers because of the unprofitability of tomatoes.Recent figures, however, tend to show that the rate of this switch hasrecently declined perceptibly, because of the fall in profitability.(d) Despite the increase in the production of roses and carnations, total returnshave fallen because prices have declined. Meanwhile, costs ofproduction have increased sharply. As a result, profitability has declined while imports have increased in terms of value.(e) The effect of the increased duties might be to increase the price of a bunchof a dozen carnations or roses by 2d., and anemones by ^d., andnarcissi by -gd. Such increases cannot be described as creating hardshipfor the consumer, and would not be reflected in the retail price index.6. We recognise the force of the domestic political considerations which canbe advanced in favour of granting the application. The Minister of Agriculture andthe Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Home Office, point out that the immediatereactions to the tariff announcement have been strong even violent. They feelthat, unless we make some favourable response, however small, to the recentseries of applications for increased tariffs, there is a serious danger that we shallnot be believed when we say that the tariff remains the principal instrument for achieving the objectives of the 1947 Agriculture Act for horticulture. They believethat the rejection of the applications on cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, endives,tomatoes and new potatoes should offset any adverse reactions on the part of our foreign suppliers of an increase on cut flowers.7. The majority of us however consider that the domestic political considerations are outweighed by the economic arguments set out in paragraph 4,and we remain of the view that an increase in these tariffs would have an unfortunate effect on the negotiations for a European Free Trade Area and might haveincalculable consequences on the Dutch in the present sensitive state of our relationswith that country.; the European countries concerned will be more impressed by the positive damage of an increased tariff than by the negative benefit of arejection of other applications for increases.Recommendation of the Economic Policy committee. We recommend, therefore, the Minister of Agriculture and the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office, dissenting, that theapplication should be rejected on the grounds that an economic case has not beenmade out; but that this should not affect the Governmenfs general policy that thetariff remains the main instrument for protecting the horticultural industry.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,29th January, 1959.
