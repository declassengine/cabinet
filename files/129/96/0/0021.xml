(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 21COPY NO.7th February, 1959CABINETRESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, 1956:SHELL-MEX AND BRITISH PETROLEUM LIMITEDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have discussed the positionof Shell-Mex and British Petroleum (B.P.) Limited, under the restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956.   This memorandum sets out purprovisional conclusions.2; Shell-Mex and B.P. Limited was set up in 1931 as a jointdistributing and marketing agency for the B ,P.&apos;(then Anglo-Persian),Shell and Eagle Groups.   It is the larest oil distributing company in theUnited Kingdom, handling over half the total trade in petroleum products.Its main competitors, the Esso Petroleum Company Limited (with one quarter of the total trade) and the Regent Oil Company Limited (with6 per cent of the total trade), are both fully under United States owner-ship.3. The agreement establishing Shell-Mex and B.P. Limited hasbeen registered under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and must indue course come before the Restrictive Practices Court.   Under thestringent provisions of the Act, it would have to be shown to the Courfssatisfaction that discontinuance of the present arrangements would denyconsumers &quot;specific and substantial benefits or advantages&quot;:  the companieconcerned have received legal advice toithe effect that it will be verydifficult, if not impossible to do this.   The companies fear, therefore,that the decision of the Court may result in the breaking up of Shell-Mexand B.P. Limited.4.         The consequences of the agreem ent being publicly condemnedby the Court would be serious:-(a)       There might well be international repercussions, particularlyin the Middle East where the oil companies are constantly subject tolocal criticism and suspicion.   Joint distributing agencies such as Shell-Mex and B.P. Limited are not found on a large scale outside the UnitedKingdom but many of the major producing enterprises in which british companies participate are joint concerns.   The spectacle of a jointcompany in the United Kingdom itself being split up as an overt resultof Government legislation might well encourage other governments to take similar action against producing companies with the object of weakening the industry^ position and strengthening that of the local-1-
administration.   Such action, which might well spread beyond the middle east to, e. g. India and Pakistan, would be a serious embarrassment tothe companies in a period when their relations with local governments are in any case likely to be difficult.(b)       Within the United Kingdom the disbandment of the Shell-Mexand B.P. organisation, after thirty years of joint arrangements, would inevitably cause considerable dislocation.   During the transitional period, management efficiency would be bound to suffer, and in thestrongly competitive oil industry this would probably mean some loss ofbusiness to the non-British competitors of Shell-Mex and B.P.The establishment of separate distributing organisation:.; for Shell-Mexand for B.P. would require the construction of separate installations andother facilities, which are at present operated jointly.   This would absorb substantial resources of materials and labour.   The advantage to the consumer of Shell-Mex and B.P. competing with one another wouldbe problematical, given the complex price structure of the oil industry.5.        In considering what action should be taken in this situation, oneof the key factors is the speed with which the Court will consider the shell and B.P. agreement.   This is a matter within the discretion of the registrar.   But there are indications that the agreement may not come before the Court for at least a year and perhaps even two years, althoughthe possibility cannot be completely ruled out of a somewhat earlierhearing if other scheduled cases collapse.6.        The two obvious lines of action are either to amend the Act orto amend the agreement.Amendment of the Act7.        We consider that it would be impracticable to seek to make anearly amendment to the Act so as to exclude from its ambit   agreements of this sort.     To take such.action after the Act has been in operation for only a short time, after the Court has made only one major judgment(and that affecting Lancashire) and when it is widely recognised thatthe mere existence of the Act has resulted in the voluntary dissolution of a number of undesirable restrictive agreements, would be widelycriticised and misrepresented.   Moreover, any amending legislation might have to be justified on the grounds of international repercussions:but to make it known that this was the reason for the amending legislation would, at the present juncture, inevitably provoke the internationaleffects which we are seeking to avoid.   Nevertheless, it would be unwise to rule out the possibility of amending the Act at a later date, perhapsafter a general review of its operation.   Even so, however, any aroend-ment in the direction desired would be difficult, and it would be a usefulprecaution to study the technical possibilities:   such a study might bebased on the provisions which except from the operation of the Act soleagency agreements and agreements certified as constituting schemesfor rationalising industry.-2-
SECRET113Amendment of the agreement8.        The companies concerned state that they can see no way toamend the agreement so as to remove it clearly from the ambit of theAct and still permit them to trade effectively in partnership.   other companies have, however, met this problem by a capital reconstruction of this side of their activities, resulting in the setting up of a singleundertaking for marketing and distribution.   There are some difficultieshere also:  B.P. is a United Kingdom company, and it would be preferable to see it retain its status and identity rather than to merge it completely,for marketing purposes, with an internationally controlled company likeShell.   We are not, however, convinced that this difficulty is insoluble,or that the companies have fully explored the possibilities open to themin this field.conclusions . &quot;ur provisional conclusions are:-(i) The main objective should be to avoid a situation in which theexisting agreement comes before the Court and is publicly condemned.(ii)      It would be impracticable to introduce early legislation to amend the Act so as to remove from its ambit the Shell-Mex and 3,P. agree-ment and others like it.   The companies should be informed, in confidence,accordingly.(iii) The companies should also be told that there is likely to be aperiod of a year, or a little more, before the agreement comes before theCourt.   They should be encouraged to use this period to work out, and put into effect, a scheme designed to take their marketing activitiesoutside the scope of the Act.(iv) Meanwhile the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Power and the Attorney-General, should, as a precautionary measure, examine further the technical possibilities of amending the Act in the direction desired, in case a suitable opportunityfor amendment arises at a later date, and any other possibilities of effective action.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.6th February, 1959
