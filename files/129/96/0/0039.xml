SECRET -        %THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ (GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1959C. (59) 39 Copy No. 5 927th February, 1959CABINETWAR WIDOWS&apos; pensions memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance in connexion with my Memoranda (C. (59) 4 and GEN. 634/28) which areat present before the Cabinet and contain proposals designed to alleviate hardshipamong a section of war widows, I think the Cabinet should know that on Friday,13 th February, I received a deputation representing the British Legion and virtually all the ex-Service organisations as well as the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;sFamilies Association.2. While this deputation raised a number of questions with which I need nottrouble the Cabinet, they made it clear that all the ex-Service organisations feelvery strongly on the subject of hardship among war widows, and give to somealleviation of this the first priority for action in the war pensions field. This isthe first time they have done so in a concerted manner.3. The two limited proposals contained in my Memoranda (C. (59) 4 andGEN. 634/28) were put forward with a view to meeting this real and stronglyfelt view about the needs of war widows held by informed ex-Service opinion, andso meeting to some extent the developing pressure on this subject, further intensifiedas it will be by certain recommendations of the Advisory Committee on recruitingunder the Chairmanship of Sir James Grigg. My assessment of the situation asbeing one which can be held by limited measures of this sort was explicitly basedon the assumption that these two steps would be speedily decided upon and announced. I think this assessment is still sound; but I am of the view that this may not remain so if these changes cannot be announced in the near future.J. A. B.-C.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C. 2,26 th February, 1959.54822
