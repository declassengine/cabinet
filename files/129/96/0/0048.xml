AGRICULTURE (SMALL FARMERS) ACT :WITHDRAWAL OF MARGINAL PRODUCTION scheme memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food in my earlier memorandum (C. (59) 33) I set out my objectionsto the proposals put forward by the Secretary of State for Scotland for extending Marginal Agricultural Production Assistance beyond the limitsprovided in the Small Farmers Act.   These objections apply with even greater force to the latest proposals of the Secretary of State (C. (59) 45)which contemplate legislation permitting marginal assistance in scotland to be continued indefinitely.2. This is contrary to our announced policy of bringing the existingMarginal Production Schemes to an end.   It would also make nonsense ofour frequently stated aim of encouraging more economic agricultural production.   The proposal of the Secretary of State to give special help to farmers in marginal areas would be a move in the opposite direction.3. These farmers are, for the most part, large farmers with incomeswell above the average.   Though they might have to make changes in theirfarming systems, they would not be put out of business by the withdrawalof marginal assistance.   And if we want to encourage the production ofmore beef stores, we ought to do so in a way that would give an equalopportunity to farmers in all parts of the United Kingdom.4. Outside Scotland, the farmers affected by the withdrawal of marginal assistance either now or in three years&apos; time - and there are over 40,000 of them - are mostly small men with low incomes.   If marginalassistance is continued in Scotland, I should be obliged to restore it inEngland and Wales;   and I have no doubt that it would also be necessary to restore it in Northern Ireland.   This might well cost over  1 million a year.It would mean that I should have to take on more staff.   Finally, becausetechnical staff would have to be diverted to deal with marginal assistance,I should be unable to fulfil my commitments under the Small FarmersScheme.5. I see no objection to an announcement being made on the lines suggested in paragraph 9(i) of the paper by the Secretary of State.   In addition Iam perfectly willing to help the Secretary of State over the planning of the rundown in marginal assistance or in making compensatory changes in the generalsubsidies. But I hope my colleagues will not go back on the decision, whichI am convinced is absolutely right, that a term should be set to marginalassistance as such throughout the United Kingdom.J.H.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S. W. 1.6th March, 1959C.(59) 48 COPY NO.jTiSth March, 1959CABINET
