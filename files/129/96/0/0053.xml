SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1959.C. (59) 47 Copy No.     Q9th March, 1959CABINETGERMANY, BERLIN AND EUROPEAN SECURITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThree courses are now open to the Western Powers-(a) The first is to stand firm on our present publicly-adopted positions. So faras Germany as a whole is concerned this means to demand reunificationby a process involving free elections and to make no agreements aboutEuropean Security except as an accompaniment to this process. Sofar as West Berlin is concerned it means to refuse to entertain the Sovietproposal for a free city even as a basis for negotiation. It also meansto refuse to accept the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (D.D.R.)in substitution for the Soviet Government as guarantor of our rightof access to the city and, therefore, to accept the risk of conflict ifand when the Soviet Government turn over the routes between Berlinand the West to the D.D.R.(b) The second course is to accept German reunification on Soviet terms,since it is not to be bought at present on any other terms, the Berlinproblem being by this means automatically settled.(c) The third course is to negotiate an interim settlement about Berlin (interimin the sense that it would be described as pending eventual Germanreunification) based on some modification of the Soviet &quot; free city &quot;proposal designed to give assurance for the continued freedom of WestBerlin. We should have to face the fact that it would be implied bysuch a settlement that the West admitted the division of Germanyas a fact which was unalterable except in the very long run.2. To choose course (a), i.e., to stand firm is to choose to have no negotiationabout Germany or Berlin at all. The Soviet Government will not engage in anydiscussion which is predicated on the possibility that reunification might bebrought about by free elections. Nor will they make any concessions to our viewthat they themselves are under a permanent obligation to underwrite the existingsituation in West Berlin and to guarantee our right of access to it. This course,therefore, offers the prospect of war or a diplomatic humiliation coupled withthe loss of West Berlin. If we forced our way to Berlin against the opposition ofthe D.D.R. which the Russians have declared that they would support, theconsequence would either be immediate hostilities or the physical destruction ofthe communications with West Berlin to restore which would require militaryaction. Humiliation would ensue if we gave the appearance of being determinedto take action and then failed to take it. Probably only a few people actuallyfavour war at this moment. Others, including prominent Americans and thePresident of the French Republic, General de Gaulle, are nevertheless also inclinedto favour course (a), not because they want war but because they believe thatbrinkmanship must be met by counter-brinkmanship and that the Russians wouldback down first.SECRET54867
2SECRET3. Course (b), i.e., German reunification on Soviet terms, means Germanneutralisation.  The arguments against this course are briefly-(i) It would risk destroying the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).(ii) It would risk the Communisation of all Germany; the Soviet Governmentwould be able to exercise continuous pressure on Germany and wouldretain the trump card of the partition of Poland.(iii) Continental Europe, given the consequent disruption of NATO, wouldfollow Germany into neutrality or worse.(iv) It would be very difficult in practice to apply a guarantee of Germanneutrality, e.g., the casus foederis would be hard to determine.(v) American troops would probably be out of Europe and Americanintervention uncertain.(vi) Since America and the Soviet Union will shortly be able each to destroythe other, irrespective of whether Germany is reunified or not, there isno valid strategic reason why we should make important concessionsto buy German reunification. We should either have it on good termsor not at all.4. The conclusion of these arguments is that German reunification is not atpresent to be bought at any price we could afford. The good terms on which wemight one day obtain German reunification are not at present obtainable. That isto say that we could not at present obtain either (a) the assurance that a unitedGermany would not eventually be Communised or (b) the removal of Soviet troopsfrom the Eastern Satellites in return for an arrangement on our side which wouldleave the American troops somewhere in Continental Europe.5. This leaves us with course (c), i.e., an interim solution about Berlin,accompanied perhaps by agreements on other points concerning Germany andEuropean security.6. This course proceeds from a different assumption from that made undercourses (a) and (b), viz., that we would seek a modus vivendi with the Soviet Unionbased on the continued division of Germany. This would accord with the ideasof the Soviet Prime Minister, Mr. Khruschev, as ascertained by the Prime Ministerin Moscow. Contrary to some expectations the Russians seem at the moment tobe more obsessed by the desire to strengthen and maintain their position in EasternEurope than they are to detach Western Germany from NATO or to prevent thegrowth of Western Germany as a nuclear Power. The point upon whichMr. Khruschev insisted more strongly than on any other was that the dividing linebetween East and West created as a result of the war could not be altered. It wasa fact which must be recognised. The German Federal Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer,must understand that &quot; something that has fallen from the waggon is as good aslost.&apos;&apos; In other words the West Germans can give up for ever the hope of oncemore being reunited with East Germany on anything approaching their terms.7. The Federal Government&apos;s view as expressed recently by responsibleofficials is that the population of the Federal Republic can be led to accept apostponement of hopes for German reunification if it can be shown &quot; some lightat the end of the tunnel.&quot; This raises the question of what light of this kind wecould show. The question is in fact whether, in putting forward proposals, weshould make these proposals subject to either: -(i) Some wider agreement on &quot; European Security &quot; which by producing anapparent relaxation of tension between East and West would appear toimprove the prospects of peaceful political settlements; and/or(ii) some sort of confederation proposal or an approach thereto, which wouldoffer a prospect of an eventual merger of the two parts of Germany,i.e., a German modus vivendi short of reunification.8. Proceeding from the above, we may consider first, an interim Berlinsettlement, second, a system of European security and, third, a German modusvivendi short of reunification.SECRET
SECRET3An Interim Berlin Settlement9. In order to obtain the acceptance of our Allies to proposals of this kind,we shall probably have to envisage a graduated series of proposals to the SovietUnion. Thus an initial proposal could be made on the basis of the present position,e.g., the Soviet Government would hold themselves responsible for continuedWestern access and there might be an exchange of undertakings between the SovietGovernment and the Western Governments. The possible elements of such aninitial proposal are set out in the Annex.10. If, as might be expected, that failed, the Western Powers could make aproposal relating to the whole of Berlin (West and East)-(a) They could propose free elections in both parts of Berlin, underinternational supervision, and the formation of a freely elected Councilfor the whole of Berlin until German reunification was achieved andas a first step towards it.(b) They could propose that the free status of the united city of Berlin couldbe guaranteed by the retention in it of Allied troops and a Sovietcontingent amounting to a quarter of the total. Alternatively oradditionally it might be possible to introduce a neutral force under aUnited Nations umbrella. Guarantees of free access could be exchanged.There could also be a United Nations guarantee and United Nationsobservers in Berlin even if there were no United Nations troops.(c) Either alternatively or in addition, they could propose a United NationsCommission whose functions would be-(i) To exercise any responsibilities on the lines of communicationsurrendered by the Soviet Government.(ii) To act as an arbiter in matters to be defined about which theremight be friction.11. If, as might be expected, that failed, the Western Powers could makeproposals as in {b) and (c) of the preceding paragraph but applicable to West Berlinonly. East Berlin would then become part of the D.D.R. This would all be ingeneral accord with what was suggested by Mr. Khruschev himself in Moscow.There is therefore some reason to suppose that a compromise solution composed ofone or more of these elements would be negotiable.12. Details of such proposals would have to be worked out further. Theposition of the D.D.R. would have to be taken care of. Mr. Khruschev hassuggested that the D.D.R. might make a declaration guaranteeing Western access,the four other Governments being in some way associated with this declaration.He seemed to recognise that it would be difficult for us to enter into a directcontractual relationship with the D.D.R.European Security13. A proposal might be made along the lines of the passage in theAnglo-Soviet communique, for some method of limiting forces and weapons, bothconventional and nuclear, in an agreed area of Europe, coupled with an appropriatesystem of inspection.14. Hitherto, we have considered such proposals as being-(a) Subject to prior agreement between the Four Powers having been reachedto discuss German reunification;(b) A fall-back position.15. We might now abandon both provisos. But it would still be necessaryto make such an offer conditional upon agreement to the other points of the package,viz., an interim solution for Berlin and a modus vivendi for Germany short ofreunification.A German Modus Vivendi Short of Reunification16. In considering such proposals weight must be allowed to the views ofthe Federal Government. Various possible forms and methods of confederationor of federation can be suggested, always subject to the proviso that the attributesSECRET
4SECRETof sovereignty were withheld from any all-German body in the creation of whichfree elections had not played a part. There are also various proposals which couldbe made for the enlargement of de facto contracts and dealings between the twoGermanies.A Peace Treaty17. We have hitherto taken the position that one ought not even to discussa peace treaty before reunification because a peace treaty must be freely negotiatedwith an all-German government. This position is no longer tenable. Unless weagree to some discussion of the problems and principles of a peace treaty therewill be no negotiation at all. Our consent to such a discussion would moreoverbe a lever for discussing almost all questions connected with Germany, includingreunification and European security, since they are all germane to a peace treaty.There would be advantage in tabling our own draft of a peace treaty, to beconcluded with a united Germany, as a reply to the Soviet action in tabling a drafttreaty to be concluded with each part of Germany separately. But we should neveradmit that our rights could in any way be affected by a treaty signed between theSoviet Government and East Germany separately. Still less could we associateourselves with such a treaty. To do so would be to abandon reunification and todeprive the Germans of &quot; the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th March, 1959.ANNEXBERLINAt a conference the Western Powers should first ask the Soviet Governmentto continue to hold themselves responsible for the free access of the Western Powersto their sectors of Berlin, by land and by air. We should say that the manner inwhich they carry out this obligation is immaterial to us. If they wish to leave theirsector of Berlin we do not mind. Nor do we mind if they appoint others as theiragents to ensure that our access is free. In that case they should, however,guarantee that these others provide facilities in respect of West Berlin not lessextensive than those they themselves now provide. If agreement were reached onthis basis (which is unlikely) it would be necessary for the Russians to give writtenguarantees, explicitly valid for a stated period, e.g., up to the time when Berlinbecomes the capital of a united Germany.2. At the same time, the Western Powers could explore the possibility ofan exchange of undertakings with the Russians. The Russians might giveundertakings that they would not impede free movement (what we would have inmind would be the movement of refugees) or allow the D.D.R. to do so. Inreturn the Western Powers might give undertakings about &quot; subversive activities &quot;and &quot; propaganda &quot; in Berlin. The Western Powers might also discuss with theRussians the possibility of transferring United Nations Agencies to Berlin, e.g.,all or some of the Agencies at present located in Geneva.SECRET
