SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. lClC.(59) 469th March, 1959CABINETGERMANY AND BERLIN - PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe Soviet Note of 1st March put forward two alteriiativesuggestions, the first for a Summit Meeting, the second for a Meetingof Foreign Ministers.   They make it clear that their own preference asalways, is for the Summit Meeting but they make the concession ofsaying that, if we are not ready for a Summit Meeting, then aConference of Foreign Ministers could be summoned,2. In both cases they say that April would suit them and eitherVienna or Geneva;  in both cases they say that the Poles and Czechsmust attend and that each side of Germany should be represented.3. The Summit Conference should, they say, discuss nthe Sovietproposals on the conclusion of a peace treaty11 as well as WesternBerlin and they say that it might also consider various aspects whichthey enumerate of European security and disarmament.   The ForeignMinisters1 Conference which they offer as an alternative would be,fto consider problems of a peace treaty and the question of WesternBerlin&quot;.    They allow two or three months for the work of such aForeign Minister&apos;s Conference.4. On 7th March the United States Government sent us the draft ofa reply to this Soviet Note.   The draft is attached at Annex A.   It willbe seen that the United States Government propose to suggest in replyto the Note that there should be a meeting of Foreign Ministers ofthe Four Powers at Geneva on 11th May, &quot;to consider questions relatingto Germany including a peace treaty with Germany and the questionof Berlin11.   The draft contains the statement that &quot;progress made bythe Foreign Ministers in dealing with these problems could open upprospects for a successful meeting of Heads of Governments11, As far asPoland and Czechoslovakia is concerned the draft only admits that thepossibility of their participation at a certain stage in the negotiationscould be contemplated.5%     The Prime Minister and I have considered this American draft andhave set out our views in a telegram to H. M. Ambassador in Washington,of which a copy is at Annex B.   It will be seen that we have come out infavour of a Summit Meeting to be held at the end of July or early in Augustand to be preceded by a Meeting of Foreign Ministers in May.   We proposethat our views should not only be made known at once to the United StatesGovernment, but should also be communicated this week to the Presidentof the French Republic, General de Gaulle, and the German FederalChancellor, Dr. Adenauer.Foreign Office, S.

No.688My immediately preceding telegram.Following is text of United States proposed draft replyto Soviet Note.&quot;The Government of the United States refers to the note ofthe Government of the U.S.S.R. of March 2, 1959 in response tothe United States note of February 16 proposing a conference ofthe Ministers of Foreign Affairs of France, U.S.S.R. United Kingdom,and United States.?he United States Government views with .favor  those statementsthe Soviet note whl&amp;h  indicate that the Soviet Government &quot;believesthere remains a possibility for collaboration among the four powerson important questions relating to Germany.   The United StatesGovernment has consistently favored, meetings of interested powersthat could provide opportunities for conducting serious discussionsof major problems and could be an effective means of reachingagreement on significant subjects.   It was for this reason that theUnited States Government in its note of February 16 proposed ameeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, U.S.S.R., United Kingdomand the United States.   The United States Government notes withsatisfaction the Soviet Government&apos;s agreement to such a meeting.Needless to say, negotiations would offer little promise forsuccess if any party y/ere to unilateral action on the matters underconsideration.   In this connectjm, the United States Governmenthas noted with particular attention recent declarations by Sovietleaders and the statement in the Soviet note which indicate thatthe Soviet Government may hold the intention of concluding aseparate peace treaty with the so-called German Democratic Republicwhich would make the latter complete masters of communicationsbetween West Berlin and the German Federal Republic.   Such a movecould result in attempts at interference with the right of freeaccess of the Western powers to Berlin, reaffirmed most recentlyby the Soviet Government along with the Governments of France, theUnited Kingdom and the United States by the agreement of June 19J+.9SECRET/which eliminated
SECRETForeign Office telegram No. 1379 to Washington- 2 -which eliminated the threat to peace raised &quot;by the Soviet blockadeof Berlin in 19V3.   Unilateral action by the U.S.S.R. which couldbring about such a situation could not be construed as a peacefulmove nor one that would contribute to a peaceful settlement.Specifically the United States Government proposes that ameeting of Prance, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom and the United Statesat the Foreign Minister level be convened in Geneva on May 11, 1959to consider questions relating to Germany, including a peace treatywith Germany and the question of Berlin.   German advisers should bepresent and should be consulted.   Progress made by the ForeignMinisters in dealing with these problems could open up prospectsfor a successful meeting of heads of Government.The United States Government fully recognizes that Poland andCzechoslovakia, like a number of other European countries, havea legitimate and direct interest in matters connected with thesettlement of problems relating to Germany.   The possibility oftheir participation at a certain stage in negotiations could thereforebe contemplated.   However, the United States Government believesthat the proposed meeting should at least at the outset involvethe four powers directly responsible for Germany.The Government of the United States, in proposing a ForeignMinister&apos;s meeting on May 11, understands that the SovietGovernment would find Geneva a suitable location.   The Governmentof the United States is therefore inquiring of the Government ofSwitzerland to determine if this place and time would be convenientand also of the Secretary General of the United Nations to ascertainif the facilities of the United Nations can be made available.&quot;B B Bsecret
ANNEX BSECRETFROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO WASHINGTONCypher/OTP P R I S E CNo. 1378March 9, 1959 D. 1.50 p.m. March 9, 1959IMMEDIATESECRETAddressed to Washington telegram No. 1378 of March 9.Repeated for information to:   Paris [Immediate]Bonn [Immediate]and Saving to:   UKDEL N.A.T.O. No. 687The United States Embassy on the night of March 7communicated to us the text of the American draft reply to theSoviet note.   The text is contained in my immediately followingtelegram.2.    The Prime Minister and I have considered the matter and havecome to the conclusions set out in the following paragraphs whichyou should communicate to Mr. Herter as soon as possible.The Prime Minister will be speaking in similar terms to Generalde Gaulle and Dr. Adenauer when he sees them this week.$.    As a result of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Russia we havebeen able publicly to commit Khrushchev to the principle of peaceby negotiation.   The Prime Minister and I are, however, convincedthat whatever progress may have been achieved beforehand, thefinal and effective negotiation on Berlin, Germany or anythingelse must be with Khrushchev himself.   That means a Summit Meeting.^.    Of course there is no guarantee that a Summit Meeting willreach agreement.   But whether or not a Summit Meeting takes place,various situations may arise.   The Russians may climb down. Ifso well and good.   An acceptable compromise of some sort may beachieved.   That would be satisfactory.   If, however, there is nota climb down, nor a compromise, we shall have to face thealternatives of war or, if we come near to war but decide in thelast minute not to have one, a diplomatic defeat coupled sooneror later with the loss of Western Berlin.5. These two latter alternatives involve such momentous issuesthat the Prime Minister considers that it would be wrong to takethe vital decisions except after a meeting of Heads of Governments.SECRET /6&apos;
SECRETForeign Office telegram No. 1378 to Washington~2~6. However, apart from the obvious undesirabilrty of appearingtoo ready to fall in with Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s suggestions we realisethat to suggest the holding of a Summit Meeting in the immediatefuture may present the United States and French Government withsome difficulties.   We are therefore prepared to agree to theSummit Meeting being postponed until the end of July or thefirst v/eek in August, whichever is the most convenient.7. &apos;    The agenda for this Summit Meeting should be a broadone somewhat on the lines of that proposed for the Heads ofGovernment meeting in the Soviet note with the German itemsuitably enlarged.8. In the meantime we think there would be every advantagein the Foreign Ministers meeting on May 11 in Geneva as theUnited States Government suggest.,   The task of the ForeignMinis ters would in fact be to prepare some of the work forthe   Summit Meeting,    The Russians are, however, unlikely toaccept the description of the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting asa preparatory meeting, and it may be necessary therefore toaccept something like the agenda which the Russians havesuggested for the   Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting.   This Russianagenda is however too restricted and we think it should bere-worded to read &quot;the problems connected with the conclusionof a peace treaty with Germany and the question of Berlin&quot;.We feel that under this wording it would in fact be possibleto discuss all matters connected with a   German peace treaty,one of which must obviously be the possibility of German re-unification./9.    Our proposalsSECRET
t | . ?SECRETWashington telegram No,1378 to Foreign Office9. Our proposals in fact amount to a combination   of the twoalternatives suggested in the Russian note and make each meetingcomplementary to the other.   Of course, even if the ForeignMinisters agreed on a satisfactory settlement of the Berlinquestion, the Summit Meeting would still he necessary not onlyto put the seal of approval on what the Fo reign Ministers hadagreed but also to discuss those other, and wider, topics withwhich they might not have dealt.   If the Foreign Ministers fail,then it will be for the Pleads of Government to oonsider theresulting very serious situation, but in that event we shall atleast have gained another two or three months from the, originalultimatum date.   During this time pressure on the Russians toabandon a policy of unilateral action will, we hope, be buildingup in the world, especially in the neutral countries and evenamong some which usually take the Russian side.   The certainprospect of a Summit Meeting should prevent the Russians from. pursuing the threat to make a separate peace treaty with EasternGermany.10. To sum up, the Prime Minister and I do not feel that theUnited States note in its reference to a Summit Meeting goes farenough.   We feel we must press for a definite proposal regardinga Summit Meeting.   We are, hew ever, ready to abandon our .preference that this Summit Meeting should take place in theimmediate future and to agree that instead the Foreign Ministersshould meet on May 11? at Geneva on the understanding that aSummit Meeting will be held subsequently and that the timefor this Meeting ~ end of July/early August - should be agreed,11. So far as the composition of either of these Meetingsis concerned, we do not ourselves feel that it would mattervery much if the Poles and Czechs did participate, lieSECRET
SECRETForeign Office telegram No 1378 to Washingtonappreciate that this might mean that Italy and a third satelliteto balance her might also have to be there.   We are, however,quite ready to agree that this matter should be, in the firstinstance, dealt with on the lines suggested in the United Statesnote though we think it may be necessary to reconsider thisposition if it becomes clear that the Russians are making theissue a breaking point.12.    If, as we hope, a reply on this basis is agreed, we favoursending it off as soon as possible and not waiting until afterour visit to Washington.   Presumably N.A.T.O. would be informedin the usual way.sssss
