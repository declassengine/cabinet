Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1959C. (59) 456th March, 1959Copy No.      57CABINETAGRICULTURE (SMALL FARMERS) ACT-WITHDRAWAL of marginal PRODUCTION scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland in a previous memorandum (C. (59) 28) I drew my colleagues&apos; attention tothe widespread opposition in Scotland to the proposed withdrawal of the marginal production Scheme following the enactment of Section 3 of the Agriculture (small farmers) Act, 1959. The unanimous view of farming opinion in Scotland is thatthis action will lead to a restriction in the cultivation of marginal land which in turn will mean a serious decline in the numbers of store cattle, more unemployment and a further depopulation of upland areas.2.   On 17th February the Cabinet agreed that (i) An increase in the rate of the hill cow subsidy of  2 per cow should be offered at the current annual review.(ii) In addition a statement should be made during the debate on the agriculture (Small Farmers) Bill in the House of Lords that theGovernment intended to keep under review the effect of the gradualwithdrawal of marginal production grants and would consider in due course whether it was necessary to introduce amending legislation(C.C. (59) 10th Conclusions, Minute 6).3. Accordingly, Lord Forbes made a statement on 18th February alonglines agreed by the Ministers concerned during the Third Reading debate on theSmall Farmers Bill, the operative words being:&quot; On the general issue, I v/ould say that in the coming months theGovernment will be giving most careful consideration to the position of thosewho have been in receipt of Marginal Agricultural Production Grants, andthey will be prepared to consider what further action is necessary if the needshould be shown.&quot;4. I would like to report further on developments since then, and myassessment of the present position.5. The farmers&apos; leaders in Scotland have said that on the strength of thestatement by the Minister of State they have so far, albeit with difficulty, succeeded in restraining their branches from renewed public agitation. If they are to hold theposition, they say that there will need to be a firm indication of the governments intentions at least concurrently with the publication of the results of the Farm price review.6. As regards the proposal to raise the hill cow subsidy, I have already mentioned the unanimity of view among Scottish Unionist members that this step would not adequately meet the needs of the situation. This view is apparentlyshared by the Scottish National Farmers&apos; Union, since nothing has been said bythem during the Price Review discussions as to the possibility of increasing thissubsidy.   On the other hand, the President of the Scottish Union has made a54856
formal statement asking the Government to review their decision to withdraw the marginal Agricultural Production grant, and direct representations have been madeto me to the same effect by the Scottish farming leaders.7. On the question of the future of marginal assistance, I have discussed withthe Minister of Agriculture the possible form which amending legislation might take. A short enabling Bill of three to five clauses would be required. This would^ jfrovide for the making of schemes designed to enable assistance to be given for an initial period of three to five years with power to renew the scheme for subsequentperiods. The schemes would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses. Assistance would be on a diminishing scale and to a restricted and well-defined category of livestock enterprises on marginal holdings. I estimate thatthe cost would be of the order of  750,000, declining to about  600,000 at the endof a three- to five-year period, with the possibility of a further tapering of assistanceafter that. This compares with a cost of  1-2 millions on marginal grants inScotland of recent years and  900,000 for the current 1959 cropping season.Generally, the cost of these proposals (including the Small Farmers Scheme) wouldbe no greater up to July 1962 than the estimated expenditure for Scotland underthe provisions of the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Act, 1959, but the money wouldbe disbursed in a more effective way, and there would be no specified date for the ending of assistance.8. Recent events have therefore strengthened my view that if we are to avoid a renewal of the campaign against withdrawal of the grants and furtherembarrassment to our own supporters, I shall need to announce, about the sametime as the issue of the White Paper on the Farm Price Review, that I propose to initiate discussions about the future of marginal assistance with the ScottishNational Farmers&apos; Union. The Government^ subsequent intentions would dependon the outcome of these discussions.9.   I seek my colleagues&apos; authority (i) To announce before the Easter Recess, by means of an Answer to anarranged Question in the House, that I would be willing to receiverepresentations from the Scottish National Farmers&apos; Union about theposition of those who had been in receipt of Marginal agricultural production Grants, and to consider in the light of those representationswhat further action may be necessary.(ii) To hold in reserve the possibility of amending legislation, on theunderstanding that a short Amending Bill should be introduced this session if necessary, although its passage would probably have to await the next Session.J. S. M.Scottish Office, S.W.1,6th March, 1959.
