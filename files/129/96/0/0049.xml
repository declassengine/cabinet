Economic Survey 1959INTRODUCTION1. The year 1958 saw a considerable change of emphasis in economic policy. The last Economic Survey concluded that the United Kingdom&apos;disability to make a positive contribution to world economic affairs would depend in particular upon the maintenance of the internal and externalvalue of the currency. Accordingly in the early part of the year theGovernment continued the restraints which had been imposed since mid-1955and reinforced in September 1957. In the first half of 1958 the currentsurplus on the balance of payments reached a record level, the reservesrose by one-third and there was a general steadying of prices. At the sametime output and employment fell slightly, mainly because of a decreasein exports and in stock building. By about the middle of the year it became clear that some increase in home demand was needed to combatthis down-turn and that it could safely take place without endangeringthe external finances or putting pressure on prices. Accordingly theGovernment took a series of steps designed to raise home demand and thus to encourage the resumption of economic growth.2. In the 1958 Finance Act the initial allowances for investment in plant and machinery and in buildings were raised by 50 per cent. In July 1958,the ceiling on bank advances was removed, the restrictions on new issues of capital were modified (they were removed altogether in January 1959)and measures were taken to encourage development in areas of relativelyheavy unemployment. In August, public investment expenditure in these areas was raised and there have since been further increases in public investment, particularly in the programmes for housing, roads and railways.In September, the restrictions on hire purchase were modified and in Octoberall such restrictions were removed. Bank Rate, which had been reduced from 7 per cent to 6 per cent in March 1958, was reduced in fourfurther stages to 4 per cent in November. These measures necessarily take time to work through the economy but in the fourth quarter of 1958 therewas a marked increase both in consumer expenditure and in public investment and at the end of the year there were signs that production was rising again.3. The United Kingdom has also been working with other governments and in international institutions to encourage world production and tradeto expand. The sixty-eight countries which belong to the international bank and the International Monetary Fund are taking steps to increasethe resources of these bodies: Fund quotas are to be raised generally by50 per cent and the capital of the Bank is to be doubled. At the Common-wealth Trade and Economic Conference in Montreal the United KingdomGovernment announced that it would introduce a new system for economic assistance loans to Commonwealth countries. The Government alsoannounced its intention to introduce a new system of Exchequer loans to theColonial territories.4. This Economic Survey begins with a short review of the internationalbackground. It then examines the changes in demand for goods and services(in real terms, i.e. at constant prices) and their effect on imports, production
and employment.   From this it turns to the behaviour of costs and prices ^1958 and to the part played by saving and by monetary policy.   It thenconsiders the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments and its general externalposition.  Finally it reviews the outlook for 1959.CHAPTER ITHE INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUND5. Summary. At the beginning of 1958, in much of the world, productionand trade had ceased to rise, in the United States there was a recession andthere was severe pressure on the currency reserves of many countries. At theend of the year the United States had almost recovered from its recession,the reserves of industrial countries (apart from the United States) had increased and most European currencies were made convertible; throughoutthe year there was little change in the general level of commodity prices.On the other hand there was a fall in the volume of world trade, the produc-tion of western European countries showed little sign of expansion and therewas a further decline in the reserves of many primary producing countries.Production, prices and trade6. In the United States industrial production continued to fall in the first four months of 1958 ; by April it was 13 per cent lower than in August1957. In May the decline was reversed and by the end of the year industrial production was not far short of the pre-recession level. The United Statesrecession contributed to the fall in commodity prices in 1957 but hadremarkably little direct impact on manufacturing countries other than Canada.The United States&apos; imports from these countries were higher in 1958 than in1957 but this was more than offset by the fall in imports from Canada andprimary producing countries. At the same time the United States&apos; exportsfell very sharply, partly because exports of some commodities were excep-tionally high in 1957, but also because of the fall in demand in two of hermain markets, Canada and Latin America. As the United States&apos; exports fellmuch more than her imports in 1958 and her external lending was main-tained, the outflow of gold and dollars from the United States was resumed and it reached the high figure of $3,000 million.7. In other industrial countries there was little or no expansion in 1958.In Canada, although industrial production was rising slightly during 1958,at the end of the year it was still lower than its previous peak. In Japanthere was some recovery from the recession but the previous peak was still not reached. Although the experience of individual countries differed widely,industrial production in continental Europe, as a whole, was higher in 1958than in 1957, but expansion stopped after the first quarter of the year.8. As total industrial production in the main manufacturing countries waslower in 1958 than in 1957 and as manufacturers were less willing to holdstocks, there was a fall in the demand for raw materials. In consequence,during 1958, commodity prices as a whole remained roughly at the level towhich they had fallen in 1957. The lower commodity prices and the smallervolume of international trade in raw materials in 1958 led to a fall in theexport earnings of primary producing countries. The fall in their earningsbegan in the middle of 1957, but it was not until well into 1958 that primaryproducing countries reduced their imports. Their imports continued to decline during the rest of the year.
m\ -    208^-9. In the Soviet Union production continued to expand rapidly but this had no significant effect on international trade as the trade of the Soviet blocis a very small proportion of the world total. In the rest of the world thefall in industrial production was accompanied by a fall in the volume ofinternational trade. A large part of the decrease was in the exports of manu-facturing countries to one another, particularly in those of the United states to Canada and western Europe.10. The improvement in reserves in Europe (notably in the United King-dom and Germany) which corresponded to the outflow of gold and dollarsfrom the United States, helped to make possible the convertibility of mostEuropean currencies at the end of the year. The reserves of many primaryproducing countries continued to fall because of the fall in export earnings in spite of a substantial increase in their external borrowing.CHAPTER IITHE UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY: USE OF RESOURCES11. Summary. The slight decline in total demand on the United Kingdom&apos;resources, which began in the second half of 1957, continued into 1958.The indications are that this decline came to an end about the middle of theyear and that in the fourth quarter there was an upturn, mainly because ofthe removal of restrictions on credit and the increase in public investment.In 1958 as a whole total expenditure in real terms was marginally lower thanin 1957. Consumers&apos; purchases of goods and services increased indeed,consumers&apos; expenditure in real terms rose slightly more than in the precedingtwo years. Gross fixed investment was also higher in 1958 than in 1957 but here the rise was smaller than before. These increases were, however, out-weighed by the decreases in stock building and in exports ; there was little change in the current expenditure of public authorities on goods and services.These changes in expenditure and their effect on output and imports are shown in the table and chart on the next page.Personal income and expenditure(see tables 2, 3 and 4 on pages [  ] to [   ]12. Incomes. In 1958 the total of wage and salary payments was just under 4 per cent higher than in 1957, compared with a rise of (s\ per cent from 1956 to 1957. There was less of a rise in 1958 because wage and salary increases were on average smaller and were negotiated later in theyear than in 1957 and because total employment was lower than in 1957.Rent, dividend and interest receipts were 8 per cent higher in 1958 than in1957 compared with a rise of 6 per cent from 1956 to 1957. The largest rateof increase, however, was in pensions and other social service payments which were nearly one-fifth higher in 1958 than in 1957 ; this mainly reflects the rise in the rate of national insurance benefits from February 1958 andthe increase in the number of people eligible for retirement pension (afterthe first ten years of the national insurance scheme).13. Altogether personal incomes in 1958 were 5 per cent higher than in1957, but tax payments and national insurance contributions rose 12 per centso that the increase in disposable income was 4J per cent. Personal saving in 1958 was about the same as in 1957 so that spending rose at about thesame rate as personal income. Part of the increase in spending was absorbed by higher prices ; in real terms the increase was 2 per cent.S   7

%,AA. Trend. Paragraphs 13 and 14 set out the changes in personal income and expenditure between 1957 and 1958, but in order to follow the effect on production it is necessary to consider the trend during the course of 1958.During the first nine months of 1958, there was little change in total personalincome : the increase in wage rates was offset by the fall in employment and hours of work. Nor was there any significant change in consumer prices orin personal savings. In consequence consumers&apos; expenditure in real termswas virtually stable in this period (apart from seasonal variations). In thelast quarter of 1958, however, there was a sharp rise in purchases of cars anddurable consumer goods and thus in total consumers&apos; expenditure in real terms. This reflected first, the increase in wages and salaries following fromthe wage settlements of the late summer and early autumn, secondly, the verylarge rise in hire purchase transactions and other forms of borrowing which followed the removal of restrictions on credit in the second half of the year.In the fourth quarter the amount of hire purchase debt owed by consumersrose by  75 million (out of an increase of  89 million in total hire purchasedebt). There was also a substantial increase in bank lending to financeconsumer expenditure.15. Pattern of expenditure. From 1957 to 1958 the largest increases inspending were in purchases of cars and other durable goods. In real terms,expenditure on new and second-hand cars in 1958 was 31 per cent higherthan in 1957. This large increase reflects the fact that purchases of carshad been depressed in the early part of 1957 by petrol rationing, as well asthe removal of hire purchase controls referred to above. Purchases of otherdurable goods were 5 per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957. There were alsosmall increases, in real terms, in expenditure on tobacco, housing, fuel and light but there were slight decreases in drink and in clothing. Food consump-tion rose by about 2 per cent; the main increases were in butter, poultry, tea,eggs, canned meat and sugar.Public authorities&apos; current expenditure16. In 1958 the current expenditure on goods and services of the Govern-ment and local authorities together was about 1 per cent lower than in 1957.This is the decrease in real terms (the changes in the Governmenfs expendi-ture in money terms are considered with the rest of the Governmenfs accountsin chapter V).17. In the Governmenfs expenditure alone, the downward trend whichhad been going on since 1953 stopped in the middle of 1958. In real termsGovernment spending on goods and services in the first half of 1958 was some 3J per cent lower than in the first half of 1957 but in the second halfof 1958 it was about the same as a year earlier. Over 1958 as a whole this expenditure was about 2 per cent lower than in 1957 a moderate fall whencompared with that of 7 per cent from 1956 to 1957.18. The decrease (in real terms) in the Governments spending on goods and services since 1956 is entirely accounted for by the reduction in defence expenditure. This resulted from the cut in the size of the armed forces from761,000 in June 1956, to 614,000 in June 1958 and to 590,000 in December1958, and from lower expenditure on engineering output. Expenditure on theNational Health Service has risen slightly since 1956 and continued to rise in1958. There has been little change in other civil expenditure on goods and services.
19. The current spending of local authorities on goods and services cctinned to rise ; in real terms it was about 2\ per cent higher in 1958 than in1957.   Most of the increase was in education ; in particular there was arise in the number of teachers in secondary schools and increased provisionfor technical and other further education.Fixed investment(see table 5, page [   ] and appendix B)20. Total fixed investment was nearly 2 per cent higher, in real terms, in1958 than in 1957, about half the rate of increase which occurred in each ofthe preceding two years. Although there was an increase in the annual totalsfrom 1957 to 1958, there was probably little change in investment during thefirst nine months of 1958 (apart from seasonal variations) ; there weredecreases in private manufacturing and in public investment but these wereoffset by increases in other forms of private investment. In the last quarterof 1958 total fixed investment started to rise again, mainly because of theincrease in public investment.  The quarterly changes are shown below.  million, 1954 prices	1st quarter	2nd quarter	3rd quarter	4th quarterC)	YearPublic sector Housing   1957       ...... 1958	76 64	78 67	71 61	71 [56]	296 [248]Other       1957       ...... 1958        ......	249 274	233 245	253 248	294 [305]	1,029 [1,072]Private sector Housing   1957       ...... 1958	65 63	66 67	61 71	64 [72]	256 [273]Other       1957       ...... 1958       ......	337 355	344 361	349 362	369 [375]	1,399 [1,453]Total    1957        ...... 1958       ......	727 756	721 740	734 742	798 [808]	2,980 [3,046]( ) Figures for the 4th quarter 1958 are provisional estimates and subject to revision.21. Private investment was nearly 3 per cent higher, in real terms, in 1958than in 1957, about the same rate of increase as in the preceding year.Manufacturing investment alone, however, fell moderately during the yearand for 1958 as a whole it was 2 per cent lower than in 1957. On the otherhand investment in private housing continued to rise : it was 6\ per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957. There was also an increase of 3  per cent in private investment in retail and wholesale distribution and in other services.22. Public investment remained at the same level in 1958 as a whole asin 1957 : during the first nine months of the year it was falling and in thethird quarter it was 5 per cent lower than a year earlier ; but in the last quarter it started to rise again.23. Public investment in housing continued to decline in 1958 When it was17 per cent lower than in 1957. The rate of decline slowed down in thecourse of 1958 and public investment in housing probably stopped fallingtowards the end of the year.  Public investment in the nationalised industries
-was 2 per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957 ; it was falling during the middlepart of the year, but started to rise again quite sharply in the fourth quarter.The main increases in public investment over the year were in electricity,railways and roads. (Details of the main public investment programmes aregiven in appendix B.)24. Over the whole field of public and private investment, the main increasein assets in 1958 was in vehicles and ships where investment was one-tenthhigher than in 1957. (This large increase partly reflects the restriction of investment in vehicles by petrol rationing in the early part of 1957.) Invest-ment in plant and machinery was 3 per cent higher in 1958 and there was asimilar increase in investment in building (other than housing). Total invest-ment in housing was 7 per cent lower in 1958, reflecting the decrease in localauthorities&apos; housing.Investment in stocks(see table 6, page    in appendix A)25. In 1958 total investment in stocks (at constant, 1957 prices) was  140million, which was  220 million lower than in 1957. Nearly one-half of this reduction represented the decline in investment in stocks of the main im-ported materials, fuel and food(1). Stocks of these materials rose by  35million in 1957 and fell by  65 million in 1958. Other stocks in the economyrose by  325 million in 1957 and by  205 million in 1958. Although these other stocks have some import content, which may change from time to time,on any view it seems likely that this decline of  120 million in the rate ofstockbuilding exercised only a moderate downward influence on home pro-duction between 1957 and 1958. The 1958 addition to stocks was, indeed,large considering that since 1955, stocks have risen steadily whereas therehas only been a slow increase in production. The fall in investment in stocksoccurred mainly in the first half of 1958.26. Stocks held by manufacturers, which account for about half total stocks,increased slightly during 1958, but (at 1957 prices) this increase was about 170 million less than in 1957. Stocks held as materials and fuel, fell by  200million, so that investment in these stocks was  230 million lower than in1957. There was only a small change in investment in work in progress, butstocks held as finished goods increased more than in 1957, particularly in thefirst half of the year when some of the stock building may well have beeninvoluntary. In the second half of the year manufacturers&apos; stocks of finishedgoods were run down rather more than in 1957.27. Outside manufacturing industry, total wholesalers&apos; stocks did. notchange much during 1958, compared with an increase in 1957. Retailers&apos;stocks also are estimated to have risen only slightly and rather less than in1957. On balance, total stocks outside manufacturing industry rose by  105million in 1958 of which the increase in coal stocks accounted for  60 million a fall in the rate of investment of almost  100 million compared with 1957.(&apos;) The change in these stocks is estimated from data available on the stocks held in theform in which they are imported by the principal stock-holding importers of the mainmaterials, fuel and food. They therefore exclude stocks of imported manufactured and semi-manufactured commodities and, for a few commodities, substantial stocks held bymanufacturers.
211Exports(see table 28, page [  ])28. In 1958 the volume of exports of goods and services was about 2 percent lower in real terms than in 1957. The volume of merchandise exportshad stopped rising in the fourth quarter of 1957. It fell slightly in the first four months of 1958 and more steeply in the middle of the year. Towardsthe end of 1958, however, exports recovered and the volume was only slightly lower than at the end of 1957. (Changes in the destination of exports are discussed in chapter VI.)29. Although total exports fell from 1957 to 1958, exports of aircraft andtheir engines rose by one-third to  148 million and exports of passenger carsrose by nearly one-fifth to  189 million. Exports of ships fell by one-fifthto  63 million. There was a small fall in exports of machinery but never -theless these exports earned  741 million. Coal exports almost halved whileexports of refined petroleum increased by 13 per cent. Textile exports fell15 per cent to  255 million and iron and steel exports fell 12 per cent to 188 million.  Exports of chemicals fell by 2 per cent to  263 million.CHAPTER iii the UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY : SUPPLIES ANDEMPLOYMENT30. Summary. In consequence of the movements of demand described in the last chapter, there was a slight decline in the volume of imports and output from the later part of 1957 until the fourth quarter of 1958when signs of recovery appeared. For 1958 as a whole, the volume ofimports was about the same as in 1957 and the gross domestic product(that is the total of goods produced and services provided in this country)was fractionally lower than in 1957. There was also a decrease in employ-ment and at the end of 1958 it was 1 per cent lower than a year earlier.Imports(see table 27, page [ ])31. The volume of imports of food, drink and tobacco was 5 per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957. This was the result of the rise in consumers&apos;expenditure and of the poor harvest and the higher livestock population athome (which led to increased imports of potatoes and feeding-stuffs). Thelong-term upward trend in imports of petroleum and finished manufacturesalso continued. On the other hand because of the decline in industrial production, the fall in investment in stocks (referred to in paragraph 25)and the reduction of marginal imports of coal and steel, the volume ofimports of industrial materials was 8 per cent lower in 1958 than in 1957,despite some recovery towards the end of the year. These increases anddecreases roughly offset each other and the total volume of imports in 1958was about the same as in 1957.Industrial production(see tables 7 and 8, page [   ])32. Industrial production, which accounts for about half the gross domestic product, was slightly lower in 1958 as a whole than in 1957.  From the thirdquarter 1957 to the third quarter 1958 it fell by 3 per cent but it began
o recover in the fourth quarter of the year and by December it had risenjust above the level of December 1957. The trend is shown below in theindex of industrial production from which seasonal variations have been omitted.Index, 1954 = 100Years	1st quarter	2nd quarter	3rd quarter	4th quarter	Year1955 ......	103	104	106	108	1051956 ......	106	106	105	106	1061957 ......	107	108	108	107	. 1071958 ......	107	106	105	107	10633. The changing pattern of demand led to varying movements in theoutput of different industries. Because of the rise in consumers&apos; demand the output of the food, drink and tobacco group of industries was 2 percent higher in 1958 than in 1957. A rise in consumers&apos; demand also led to increased activity in the printing and publishing industries. On the otherhand, although consumers&apos; purchases of clothing and footwear were only slightly less in 1958 than in 1957, the output of the textiles, leather and clothing industries was 8 per cent lower. In the textile industries aloneoutput was 10 per cent lower, mainly because of a reduction of stocks in the textile and clothing industries and in the distributive trades ; thereduction in textile exports accounted for only a small part of the fall. In thefourth quarter of 1958 there were fairly general signs of recovery in these industries, apart from the cotton industry. The production of carpets andfurniture was stimulated by the removal of hire purchase restrictions.34. Engineering and allied industries (see table 9). There was little change from 1957 to 1958 in the production of the engineering and allied group ofindustries as a whole. An increase of 11 per cent in output of the motor industry, to meet rising home demand for cars and increased exports, wasone of the factors which maintained production in 1958. Another was the recovery during the fourth quarter of the output of many engineering con-sumer goods, which followed the removal of hire purchase restrictions ; mainly for this reason the output of radio and other apparatus was about 5 per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957. On the other hand, the output of a range of miscellaneous metal goods and engineering components was lower than in1957. The expansion associated with an increase in consumer demand wasoffset by a slight decline in the general level of activity in the much largerseotor of the engineering industries which is concerned primarily with capital goods. This decline followed a continuous expansion since 195 3. Thevolume of uncompleted orders on hand was falling throughout 1958. In theaircraft industry output was also slightly lower in 1958 than in 1957: therewas an increase of about one-third in exports but this was more than offset by a decrease in output against United Kingdom defence orders. The totalof orders held by the industry at the end of 1958 was little different froma year earlier but a substantial proportion of these orders were for aircraftscheduled for delivery a considerable time ahead and there is likely to be afurther contraction in the size of the industry. The output of the shipbuilding industry in 1958 was much the same as in 1957: there was a fall in thetonnage of merchant ships completed for overseas owners, but an increasein those for owners in the United Kingdom. Orders on hand at the endof 1958 represented an average of three years&apos; work for the industry as awhole, but many smaller firms and those building only dry cargo vessels were coming to the end of their orders while the large firms and thosebuilding tankers had orders for up to five years ahead.
35. Among the other industries which mainly produce intermedia),products (apart from steel), most of the changes in output from 1957 to 1958were small. There was a fall in production in the chemical and allied group of industries (excluding oil refining) and in the industries closely associatedwith building (bricks, cement, etc.). There was again an increase in theoutput of the paper industry.Changes in Industrial Production and EmploymentPERCENTAGE CHANGE 1956 TO 195836. Construction (see table 10). The total output of the construction industry was falling in the early part of 1958, mainly because the number ofhouses started by local authorities was 20 per cent lower than a year earlier ;by the end of the year, however, these housing programmes were rising again:the number of tenders approved rose from 33,000 in the third quarter of 1958to 44,000 in the fourth quarter. The amount of new building work, otherthan housing, carried out for public authorities also fell slightly in the first part of 1958 but it increased considerably in the second half. As a resultof these changes, in the fourth quarter of 1958 the output of the buildingindustry was higher than in the fourth quarter of 1957. In the year as a whole the amount of new building work other than housing carried out for public authorities was about 7 per cent higher than in 1957 ; private housing con-tinued to expand and reached a post-war record in 1958. These increases were, however, offset by a decrease in industrial building as well as in localauthority housing so that the total output of the construction industry in 1958was marginally below that of 1957.37. Steel (see table 11). The output of steel was 10 per cent lower in 1958than in 1957. About one-quarter of the decrease was the result of the fall indirect exports of steel; the rest was partly the result of the fall in the useof steel in coalmining, wagon-building, shipbuilding and construction andpartly the result of de-stooking: consumers of steel began to draw on then-stocks at a moderate rate in the second quarter of 1958 and to a muchgreater extent in the third and fourth quarters. Because of the fall in demandfor steel, the capacity of the United Kingdom&apos;s mills was sufficient to meet allsteel requirements with the exception of sheet, where imports were still necessary.38. Fuel and power (see tables 12-15). In 1958 home consumption of fuel and power was much the same in total as in 1957.  There was a large fall
-My % the use of coke by the iron and steel industry. The demand for coal was also reduced by the lower export demand and by the substitution of oil for coal. Altogether, coal consumption, including exports and bunkers,was 6 per cent lower in 1958 than in 1957. The output of coal was reduced by 4 per cent and there was a substantial increase in coal stocks.Home consumption of oil rose 25 per cent, with large increases in the fuel oil used at power stations, in the use of road fuel and in industrial, com-mercial and domestic consumption. The production of oil at United Kingdomrefineries in 1958 rose above the previous record level in 1956. The supplyof gas was 1 per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957 and the supply ofelectricity was 8 per cent higher.Agricultural production(see table 16, page [    ])39. In agriculture the main object is greater efficiency rather than apincrease in total output. Progress in 1958-59 has been masked by bad weather. The index of net agricultural output for the year June 1958 to^ May1959, is expected to be slightly below the record level of the preceding year.The acreage sown to crops and temporary grass was larger but the cold wetsummer reduced yields of cereals and potatoes below normal; the feedingquality of grass and fodder crops also suffered. There were, however, plenti-ful supplies of fruit and vegetables. Livestock output is expected to be slightly lower this year than last; this, too, is partly because bad weather and poor grazing have reduced the milk yield but there has also been some reduction in the size of the milking herd. Beef production is likely to be lowerin 1958/59 than in 1957/58 when it was temporarily high for special reasons ;next year, however, there is likely to be a further expansion. The output of mutton and lamb has declined slightly, mainly because of the poor grazingand disease. Output of pigmeat is at present high, but there will probably bea decrease later. The output of eggs has risen further and table poultrycontinues to increase rapidly.40. In October 1958 the Government announced a scheme for helpingsmall farmers to increase their efficiency (particularly by improvements infarm management) and to improve the profitability of their farms. grants are to be given for approved farm business plans to be carried out over three to five years. This help will be in addition to the Farm ImprovementSoheme under which farmers and owners may receive grants to modernisetheir farm buildings and fixed equipment. A scheme of grants for the horticulture-cultural industry, to assist it to improve its efficiency, especially as regards thepreparation of produce for market, is also to be introduced. This scheme will also help to promote co-operative action in horticultural marketing.Inland transport41. The volume of railways&apos; freight traffic in 1958 was about 12 per centlower than in 1957. The main reason was the lower demand for coal andfor iron and steel products which provide a large proportion of railway traffic.There was also a decline in general merchandise traffic. Passenger traffic on British Railways in 1958 was slightly lower than in 1957 though in thelatter part of the year it was a little higher than in the same period of 1957.The volume of goods carried by road vehicles, however, was higher in 1958than in 1957 ; the number of goods vehicles increased by about 4J per cent.Part of the difference in the volumes of rail and road traffic between 1957and 1958 was caused by fuel rationing early in 1957. Bus traffic continued itsslow decline.  The number of motor cars in use increased by over 8  per cent.
21 &amp;Employment and unemployment f(see tables 17 and 18, pages [   ] and [  ])42. Civil employment, like production, reached a peak in the third quarterof 1957 and then started to fall. At the end of 1958 it was 253,000 (or about1 per cent) lower than a year before. There was also a fall of 60,000 in the armed forces. Employment fell slightly in most industry groups. Thelargest decreases were in iron and steel, textiles and engineering. There wasa significant increase only in professional, financial and miscellaneous services.43. Apart from seasonal variations, unemployment in Great Britain rosethroughout 1958 and in December, at 532,000, was 196,000 higher than a year before. This was 2-4 per cent of all employees, compared with 1-5 per cent at the end of 1957. The rise in the number of people registered as unem-ployed was smaller than the fall in the numbers at work because many ofthose who left their jobs were married women and elderly people whodecided not to seek further employment. The increase in unemployment wasspread throughout industry, though the biggest rates of increase were in ironand steel, textiles and engineering. All regions were affected to some extent.The main increases were in Scotland, the East and West Ridings and theNorth-Western region. Scotland and Wales remained the regions in britain with the highest rates of unemployment. In Northern Ireland the unemploy-ment rate in December 1958 was 8-3 per cent, compared with 7-6 per cent a year before.44. During the year the Government took a number of steps to help relievelocal unemployment. The Treasury&apos;s powers, under the 1945 Distributionof Industry Act, to give financial assistance to industrial undertakings in development Areas were extended in a new Distribution of Industry Act.This permitted the Treasury to provide assistance to all kinds of trades andbusinesses in areas of high and persistent unemployment. At the same timethe Government announced a more stringent application of the Board ofTrade&apos;s power to withhold Industrial Development Certificates in order toencourage new or expanding businesses to set up in areas where unemploy-ment was high.45. As indicated in paragraph 32, industrial production declined during thefirst three-quarters of 1958 ; in the third quarter it was about 3 per centlower than in the same quarter of 1957 while industrial employment wasabout 2 per cent lower. Between the third and fourth quarters of 1958 therewas some increase in production, but this did not appear to have muoh effecton employment. In the fourth quarter production was about the same asin the fourth quarter of 1957, while employment was about 2\ per cent lower.From this it would seem that output per man in industry fell slightly in thefirst three-quarters of 1958 but rose in the last quarter. In 1958 as a wholeoutput per man in industry was a little higher than in 1957.46. At the end of 1958, there were unused resources available in the economy, not only of labour but also of capital equipment. Both the extent ofthis excess capacity, and its causes show marked differences from industryto industry. Some industries are very busy, while some have a large marginbecause of the large and probably permanent shift in the balance of demand at home or abroad. In general, it is very unlikely that the effective capacityof the whole economy is nearly as great as the sum of the amounts which each plant could add to output if it were fully used.
CHAPTER IVCOSTS AND PRICES(see table 19, page     )47. Summary. During 1958 prices rose very little. Indeed the average level of export prices, wholesale prices and retail prices (apart from food andrents) hardly changed at all, despite the fact that wages and salaries wererising and the average level of import prices had ceased to fall. In 1958the earlier fall in import prices prevented final prices from rising in spiteof the increase in other costs of production. The index of retail prices roseby nearly 2 per cent between the end of 1957 and the end of 1958 ; thiswas almost entirely a result of the increase in rents and in the average levelof food prices.Costs in the whole economy48. Wages and salaries. Wage rates rose by just over 3\ per cent during1958. This is less than the increases in the preceding two years : 5J percent in 1957 and nearly 8 per cent in 1956. On the whole increases in wage rates in 1958 took place later in the year than those in 1957, and someof the most important agreements were not reached until the last quarter.The total amount paid out in wages and salaries also reflects the increasein salary rates (on which there is no comparable information) as well aschanges in the level of employment and in the amount of overtime and short-time worked. In the second half of 1958, the total of wages and salaries was 3-1 per cent to 4 per cent higher than in the second half of 1957.49. Unit costs.- Over the economy as a whole the increase in the totalcost of wages and salaries during 1958 was not accompanied by an increasein total output so there was a rise in average labour costs per unit of output.In the event, however, this was roughly offset overall by the effect of lowerimport prices. It is possible that some of the fall in import prices had not had time to work right through to selling prices by the end of 1958 ; theindex of wholesale prices of basic materials and fuel used in manufacturing industry was still falling early in 1959. On the other hand it seems likely thatthe pressure of rising labour costs towards the end of 1958 will equal or out-weigh any further effects to be felt from the lower import prices.Costs and prices in manufacturing50. Changes in the prices of manufactured goods reflect to a large extentprevious changes in costs of production, though the time lags are uncertain.In the following paragraphs an attempt is made to analyse the factorsaffecting manufacturers&apos; prices in the last two years.51. Materials. The cost of basic materials and fuel accounts for about a quarter of the value of output of manufacturing industry. From January 1957to February 1958 the relevant index of wholesale prices fell by 11 per cent;from then to the end of 1958 there was hardly any further change. If this had been the only factor involved, prices might have been expected to fall by nearly 3 per cent. In fact they hardly fell at all, and towards the end of 1958they began to rise. The explanation appears to be partly that manufacturershad not passed on the whole of the rise in commodity prices which followed the Suez crisis, and partly that other costs had been increasing.52. Wages and other costs. Wage rates in manufacturing rose about 5-1per cent during 1957 and by about Z\ per cent during 1958. In 1957 earningsrose more than wage rates but in 1958 they rose less: in the last pay-week ofOctober 1958 the earnings of manual workers in manufacturing were less than2 per cent higher than they had been a year earlier.  Over the two-year period,17
output fell rather less than employment but taking into account the mNments in both (already discussed) it is clear that labour costs per unit of output rose over the two-year period though the increase was probably lessthan the increase in wage rates. Salaries and certain other costs were alsorising during 1957 and 1958. Considering these rather divergent movements in the components of costs together, there is no clear evidence of whethertotal unit costs in manufacturing industry rose or fell over the whole two-year period.   But there may have been a slight rise.Costs and Prices in ManufactureJANUAKY iS56 --- 100Wage ratesBasic materials and fuelQuartersQuartersJan./Feb.195953. Prices. The index of wholesale prices of all manufactured goods,which had been rising through most of 1957, became stationary in the fourthquarter and remained so through most of 1958. Towards the end of theyear there was a slight upward tendency, probably because of the autumnwage increases and the higher prices for foodstuffs used in the food manufac-turing industry. Thus these prices behave roughly in accordance with theview that there had been little change in unit costs as a whole. In thesecircumstances it does not seem likely that there can have been any significantmovement of profit margins up or down.Retail prices(see tables 20 and 21, page     )54. The increase in the retail price index during 1958 was under 2 percent; this was less than half the increase that occurred during 1957 and alsomuch less than the annual average increase of nearly 5 per cent between 1948and 1956.   The main changes over the past two years are shown below.Percentage change	Weight in retail price index Jan. 1956	Annual average 1948-1956	Dec. 1956 to Dec. 1957	Dec. 1957 to Dec. 1958Food	35	4- 1	4-3&apos;i	4-3Manufactures (&apos;)   .........	38	-1-24-	+2i	-Housing (rent, rates, etc.)......	9	H-3i	411*	4-other (2)     ............	18	45i	47*	4- iAll retail prices	100	4 5	44*	42(&apos;) Alcoholic drink, tobacco, durable household goods, clothing and footwear and miscellaneous-neous goods.(2) Fuel and light, transport and vehicles and services.
*o5, Manufactures. The general level of prices of manufactured goods(other than food) entering into the retail price index, like that of wholesale prices, was very stable during 1958. There was a slight fall between thebeginning and the end of the year in average prices of durable household goods and clothing, mainly as a result of changes in purchase tax in the1958 Budget. The prices of alcoholic drink and tobacco were stable, andthe average prices of miscellaneous goods rose a little.56. Food and housing. Out of the rise of nearly 2 per cent in the retail price index for all items during 1958, nine-tenths was the result of increases in food prices and in the cost of housing. The average price of food rosesharply in the second quarter of the year mainly because of the shortageof potatoes from the 1957 crop together with higher prices for meat andbacon. With the arrival of the new potato crop and the seasonal fall in fruit and vegetable prices, the index fell in the third quarter. In the last quarterof the year, however, it rose again, partly because the main 1958 crop of potatoes was again very poor. The cost of housing increased throughoutthe year, mainly because of the rise in rents of privately-owned houses andflats permitted by the Rent Act, but there v/as also some increase in rents oflocal authority houses and, in many areas, there was an increase in rates.Export prices57. The rise in the average level of all export prices which had been going on since early 1955 came to an end in autumn 1957 ; in most of 1958export prices were stable but towards the end of the year there was a slightdownward tendency. In addition to the relative stability of unit costs in manufacturing, mentioned in paragraph 52, this trend in 1958 reflected the pressure of competition from other manufacturing countries. The average price of engineering products, alone, continued to rise, though less than inother recent years. On the other hand the average price of textile exports,which had risen until early 1958 fell back below the level in the first halfof 1957 and there was a small fall in the average export price of metals.Over 1958 as a whole the index of export prices was 1 per cent lower thanin 1957.   The movement of these prices during 1958 is shown below.Indices, 1954 = 100	1953	1958	1958	1958	1959	1st	2nd	3rd	4th	January	quarter	quarter	quarter	quarter	Manufactured goods:					Metals............	119	119	118	117	116Engineering products	114	114	115	116	117Textiles (excluding clothing)...	103	103	101	98	99Other  ............	105	104	105	105	104All U.K. exports         ......	110	110	110	109	109
CHAPTER VFINANCIAL AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS58. Summary. In 1958 as in 1957, the United Kingdom saved and in-vested at home and abroad about one-fifth of the gross national product.Personal saving financed about one-third of total investment, the saving of companies financed nearly one-half and the remaining one-sixth was financed by public authorities. Monetary policy, as one of the factors in the pattern of saving and investment, helped to restrain home demand in the early part of 1958; later, when the emphasis of economic policy changed,many financial and monetary restrictions were removed in order to encourageinvestment and promote expansion.Personal saving(see table 2, page     )59. The rate of personal saving in 1958 was roughly 9 per cent of dis-posable income, about the same as in 1957. The background to this was asmall rise in the level of real income : as indicated in paragraph 13, the totalof disposable money incomes rose by 4J per cent while consumer prices were\ per cent higher ; thus consumers&apos; expenditure cculd rise by 2 per cent in real terms without affecting the level of saving. Among other factors whichinfluenced personal saving was the removal of hire purchase restrictions ; the consequential increase in personal debt constitutes an offset to saving inother forms.60. The total of net personal saving in 1958 was  1,500 million. It isnot possible to give a complete account of the changes in capital assets and liabilities corresponding to this total but some of the main -items were asfollows. Shares and deposits in building societies increased by about  175million and there was an increase of about  600 million in life assuranceand superannuation funds. In spite of a substantial increase in borrowing from the banks, personal deposits less advances rose by  38 million. the funds held in various forms of National Savings went up by  197 million, a particularly large amount; in 1957 the increase was only  70 million.Investment by people in new houses and in business assets amounted to 688 million. On the other hand, new advances from building societiesexceeded repayments by over  150 million ; and the increase in hire purchasedebt over the year (including a small proportion relating to business assets)amounted to  98 million,  33 million more than in 1957.Company income, saving and investment(See table 22, page     )61. In 1958 the total income of industrial and commercial companies wasabout the same as in 1957 ; a 4 per cent fall in gross profits on trading in theUnited Kingdom was offset by a sharp rise in other income (largely in profitsearned abroad). There was an increase of nearly 4 per cent in the amount paid out in ordinary and preference dividends and of 1\ per cent in interestand other dividends, but these increases were more than offset by a fall inthe amount set aside for income tax and profits tax so that there was a6 per cent increase in the balance, that is in company saving.62. The amount of funds used by companies for fixed capital expenditure and for stocks was lower in 1958 than in 1957 as the much smaller increasein the value of stocks was only partly offset by an increase in their fixed
apital expenditure. The available information about changes in purelyfinancial assets is not complete nor up-to-date so it is not possible to saywith certainty that the financial position of companies was easier in 1958 thanin 1957. But it seems probable that their position improved. this impression is supported by the substantial fall from 1957 to 1958 in applica-tions to the Capital Issues Committee and in actual new issues of stock exchange securities.Government revenue and expenditure(see table 23, page     )63. The steady rise in Government revenue, which has been a feature ofrecent years, continued in 1958 when it was  400 million higher than in1957. Receipts from taxes on income rose by  130 million and there wasalso an increase of over  200 million in National Insurance revenue following the rise in rates of contribution in February 1958.64. Government expenditure on goods and services only, at constant prices, was 2 per cent lower in 1958 than in 1957 (see paragraph 17) but at current prices and including all current payments it was about  440 million higher in 1958 than in 1957. The largest increase was  213 million in national Insurance payments, of which  12 million resulted from the increasein unemployment,  164 million from the rise in benefits (which accompanied the rise in contributions) and the rest mainly from an increase in the numbersof people qualifying for pensions. There was an increase of  90 million indebt interest, partly because interest charges were higher on average in 1958than in 1957 and partly because interest on the North American loans was paid in 1958 but deferred in 1957. As there was a smaller increase in expenditure than in revenue, the revenue surplus rose from  631 million in1957 to  651 million in 1958.65. On capital account, from 1957 to 1958 there was a big fall in lendingto local authorities (who were spending less for capital purposes andborrowing more in the market). Lending to public corporations was a littlehigher : there was a rise in loans to nationalised industries but a fall in loans to other corporations. Over  240 million more was required to finance the increase in the reserves of gold and foreign currencies. Altogetherpayments on capital account were about  100 million higher in 1958 thanin 1957. Capital expenditure was financed rather differently in 1958 from1957: the revenue surplus was slightly lower, the increase in the fiduciaryissue was much less, and there was a net repayment of  71 million on loans to overseas Governments instead of a net borrowing of  58 million. these reductions were offset by a sharp rise in receipts from National Savings andfrom the sale of Government securities.Balance of saving and investment(see table 24, page [ ])66. For some years there has been a fairly regular pattern in thedistribution of saving and investment between different parts of the economy,with some parts having a surplus of saving over their own investment while others have invested more than they saved. In the following table bothsavings and investment are shown before deduction of depreciation or stockappreciation. (The investment represents expenditure on fixed assets orstocks in the United Kingdom only, i.e. investment overseas is not included.)21

Government saving is equalto the surplus on revenue account less taxes on capital plus transfers to capital account.67. The general pattern of saving and investment in 1958 was similar tothat of other recent years, with persons, companies and the Government asthe net suppliers of savings to the public corporations and local authoritieswhose own savings fell short of their investment. The only marked difference was that the surplus of companies was distinctly larger than in 1957 andother recent years. When the surpluses and deficits are added together, thetransfers of savings between the different parts of the economy cancel out,leaving the net increase in overseas assets of all United Kingdom residentstaken together. Most of this increase is the counterpart of the currentsurplus on the balance of paymentS-O) The reasons why it was so much larger in 1958 than in preceding years are set out in chapter VI.Monetary developments(see tables 25 and 26, pages )68. At the beginning of 1958, it was the continuing aim of the Govern-ment&apos;s monetary policy to restrain home demand and to restore confidence in sterling. Bank advances were being held in check in accordance withthe Chancellors request of September, 1957. Bank Rate was 7 per cent,and policy towards new capital issues was restrictive. Conditions in thegilt-edged market were making possible substantial sales of stock by theauthorities ; these sales increased the authorities&apos; control over the liquidity ofthe monetary system. Although Exchequer requirements were enlarged bythe need to finance considerable additions to the exchange reserves, receipts from issues and sales of stocks and, later, from Tax Reserve Certificates andfrom the substantial growth in National Savings, greatly reduced theExchequer market borrowing through Treasury bills during the year whichwould otherwise have been necessary.69. As the year progressed, it became clear that some relaxation waspossible.

be made in Bank Rate from 7 per cent to 6 per cent in mid-March andthen by four further stages to 4 per cent in mid-November. In July 1958the Chancellor announced that the ceiling on bank advances would beremoved at the end of the month and that the Capital Issues Committeewould be asked ,to take a less restrictive attitude towards applications for new issues. He also announced that a provisional scheme had been preparedwhereby the liquidity of the banking system could be restricted, should theneed arise, through a call by the Bank of England for special deposits tobe made with them by the banks. The purpose of this scheme was toenable existing market machinery for influencing bank advances to be reinforced without recourse, in the future, to official requests for quantitativelimits on advances. Restrictions on hire purchase were relaxed inSeptember 1958 and finally removed in October. In February 1959,Treasury consent was no longer required by United Kingdom residents for most forms of raising money and -the functions of the Capital Issues Com-mittee were accordingly much reduced.70. Treasury bill rates fell by slightly more than the reductions in bank rate in 1958. The decline in medium and long-term interest rates wasslower and less marked, and was moderated by substantial sales of longer-term Government stock. The prices of equity shares began to increase earlyin the year; the rise accelerated in the autumn and prices reached a peakat the end of the year. The average dividend yield fell from nearly. 7 percent in January 1958 to about 5J per cant at the end of December.71. Net deposits with the London clearing banks rose over the year by 245 million, which was slightly more than in 1957. The liquid assets ofthe clearing banks (their holdings of cash, bills and money at call) fell by 171 million, the first fall since 1954 over a calendar year as a whole, andtheir liquidity ratio fell from 38-4 per cent to 34-6 per cent. The rise in netdeposits was associated with some net rise in their investments and a sub-stantial increase in their advances. Their investments, including trade i-nvest-ments, rose by  154 million during the first three-quarters of the year, andfell by  101 million during the last quarter.72. Bank advances were held in check in the first half of 1958 ; in each month of that period they were lower than in the corresponding month of1957. After the removal of restrictions, advances started to rise fairlyrapidly. The rise of  252 million between August and December representedan increase in advances to business as well as to personal borrowers. Someof the new advances probably represented repayments of trade credit andof accommodation from &quot;finance houses. After July 1958 the banks extendedtheir services, offering new facilities for loans to personal customers and,in some cases, a &quot;personal cheque&quot; system, giving customers a limitedbanking service at low cost. Most of the clearing and Scottish banksacquired interests in hire-purchase finance companies.73. Thus monetary policy was one of the instruments in the Govern-menfs policy of restraint in the early part of 1958, and more recently, ithas been used to facilitate the expansion which is now being encouraged.Progress has also been made in the year towards the longer-term objectives of lengthening the average life of the National Debt and improving theauthorities&apos; control over the monetary system.
CHAPTER VIOVERSEAS TRADE AND PAYMENTS74. Summary. In 1958 the United Kingdom had a record current surplus in its balance of payments, largely -because import prices were much lower than in 1957. This surplus was accompanied by an increase in overseas investment, but nevertheless far more was added to the reserves than to short-term liabilities.  Thus the external position was greatly strengthened.The trade balance(see tables 27-29, pages [  ] to [   ])75. There was a considerable improvement in the United Kingdom&apos;balance of trade between 1957 and 1958, mainly because of the fall in world commodity prices and hence in the United Kingdom&apos;s import prices.In the second half of 1957 world commodity prices and freight chargesdeclined from the temporary peak of the Suez period, and they continuedto falU as world industrial activity slackened and the supply of industrial materials exceeded the demand. In consequence from April 1957 to March1958 the United Kmgdom&apos;s index of import prices fell by 12 per cent andalthough it then ceased to fall, the cost of imports continued to be much less than the average cost in 1957. Prices of imported food shared in thefall up to March 1958 but rose again after that and by the end of the yearhad returned to., the level before the Suez period. The general levell of rawmaterial prices was steady in 1958.76. The volume of imports in 1958 as a whole was almost the same as in1957 ; in the first three-quarters of 1958 it was slightly lower than in thecorresponding period of 1957 but in the fourth quarter of 1958 it was higherthan a year earlier. Thus all the decline in expenditure on imports from1957 to 1958 was a result of the fall in prices which were on average 8 percent lower in 1958 than in 1957. As indicated in chapter IV, the export price index was about 1 per cent lower in 1958 than in 1957 so that the terms oftrade moved 7 per cent in favour of the United Kingdom between the twoyears. Export earnings were about 3-J per cent lower in 1958, but the fall wasnot spread evenly over the year. Two-thirds of the total fall of  110 milliontook place during the middle four months of the year. During the last four months exports were only slightly lower than in the corresponding months of1957, when they had first ceased to rise. Re-exports were higher in 1958than in 1957, and the total fall for exports and re-exports together was  96million or 3 per cent.77. Exports to the dollar area were 3 per cent higher in 1958 than in 1957 ;exports to the United States alone were 15 per cent higher. On the otherhand exports to western Europe were 7 per cent lower. Exports to the rest ofthe sterling area were 3 per cent lower : in the first four months of 1958they were rising but they fell in the rest of the year, mainly because of thereduction of imports by some of the independent countries in the sterling area as a result of their reduced export earnings.The current account(see table 30, page     )78. As a result of the changes in the values of imports and exportsdescribed above, the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of visible trade was much
 y, pre favourable in 1958 than in 1957. In balance of payments termsO)raere was a surplus on visible trade last year of  121 million comparedwith a deficit of  56 million in the preceding year. This was a strikingresult: it is the first time since the war and probably for many years before that this country has had a surplus on visible trade. The mainfigures for the visible balance and the rest of the current account are asfollows:  million		1958	1957	(provisional)Imports	3,573	3,312Exports	3,517	3,433Visible balance	-     56	4-   121Government (net) ...	-   143	-   227Other invisibles (net)       ......	4&quot;    461	4-   566Current balance	-f-   262	4-   460All of the surplus on visible trade was earned in the first half of the yearwhen it reached  141 million ; it was partly offset by a deficit of  20 million in the second half. The reason for the difference was that, in the first half, the reduction in imports was only partly offset by a small fall in exports since the countries producing primary commodities were stillimporting at a high level (often by drawing on their reserves) ; in the second half, however, there was a larger fall in the United Kingdom&apos;s exports whileimports began to rise again.79. In 1958, in addition to the surplus on visible trade, the United King-dom had its customary large surplus on invisible transactions ; this was indeed slightly higher than in 1957. There was an increase in net shippingearnings from 1957 to 1958 mainly because the fall in tramp rates led toa sharper fall in the United Kingdom&apos;s expenditure on foreign shippingBalance of Payments  MILLION   MILLION(&apos;) For balance of payments purposes, imports as well as exports are estimated on an f.o.b.basis whereas in the Trade and Navigation Accounts imports are valued c.i.f. There are also some other, smaller, differences between the two sets of figures. The inclusion of insurance and freight in the Trade Accounts imports figures is the chief reason why the &quot; trade gap&quot;,as shown in the Trade Accounts, is apparently so large and adverse even in a year like 1958.
2 2 s- .     fthan in its own earnings. There was also an increase in the oil industry.,net earnings (which had been reduced by the Suez crisis in the first half of1957). On the other hand there was a decrease in the net credit frominterest, profits and dividends ; this was mainly because the annual paymentof interest on the United States and Canadian loans were made in 1958 butnot in 1957 ; it also reflected the lower earnings of United Kingdom investsments in the rest of the sterling area. The Governmenfs net military expenditure abroad, particularly in Germany, increased heavily from 1957to 1958 while there were decreases in receipts of defence aid from the UnitedStates and in expenditure by the United States and Canadian fares in theUnited Kingdom.80. In 1958, the total surplus on current account, taking visible trade andinvisibles together, was  460 million ; this was easily the best since the warand much larger than the highest in any other period of twelve months(which was  300 million in the year from July 1953 to June 1954). How-ever,  330 million or nearly three-quarters of the 1958 surplus was earned in the first half of the year, when imports were cheaper and there was onlya slight fall in export earnings. In the second half the much smaller surplusof  130 million resulted from a reduction in exports and increase in thevolume of imports. In the year as a whole there was, as usual, a substantialsurplus with the rest of the sterling area, which amounted to  438 million-the largest yet recorded. In addition there was a surplus of  22 million withthe non-sterling world, which was also one of the most favourable balanceswith that area since the war. The United Kingdom&apos;s total current surpluswas matched partly by long-term investment abroad and partly by an improve-ment in the external monetary position ; these developments are discussed in the next two sections.Balance of current and long-term capital transactions81. The United Kingdom^ net long-term overseas investment (which covers private capital transactions as well as those between Governments)is estimated at  256 million in 1958 ;  116 million was in the first half of theyear and  140 million in the second half, when the annual instalments onthe North American loans were paid. Apart from these instalments mostof the net outflow was to countries of the rest of the sterling area ; the out-ward movement of capital to the non-sterling world was largely offset by aninward flow. The balance of the United Kingdom&apos;s current and long-term capital transactions with all other countries was as follows:  million		1958	1957	(provisional)Current balance    .........	-1-   262	4-   460Long-term    capital    transactions		net (outflow-)   ...	-   207	-   256Balance of current and long-term		capital transactions	4-     55	4-   204Sterling holdings and reserves(see table 31, page   )82. The export earnings of many of the primary producing countries ofthe rest of the sterling area were reduced in 1958, because commodity prices were lower on average than in 1957 while the total imports of the area were

-    22?high because of heavy expenditure of some countries on development pr-ivjects. The net result was that the rest of the sterling area had a largercurrent deficit with the United Kingdom and with the non-sterling world thanin 1957. The current deficit with the non-sterling world was more thancovered by gold production and the inflow of capital. This amounted to over 400 million and was mainly drawn from the International Bank for Recon-struction and Development and from the United States. Although capital investment by the United Kingdom in the rest of the sterling area exceeded 200 million in 1958, these countries still had a substantial deficit v/ith theUnited Kingdom, particularly in the first half of the year. This was not quite covered by their surplus with the non-sterling world, so that during 1958they drew on their sterling holdings for  82 million.83. In the first half of 1958 the fall of  76 million in the sterling holdings of the rest of the sterling area was balanced by a rise of  77 million in thoseof non-sterling countries as confidence in sterling was renewed after the crisis of 1957. Other monetary or financing items in the balance of pay-ments were positive, partly because of the fall in the level of acceptancesoutstanding. The result of these changes was that in the first half of 1958the reserves rose by  287 million.84. In the second half of the year, while the sterling holdings of the restof the sterling area were almost unchanged, those of non-sterling countriescontinued to rise strongly, which indicated the continued confidence in sterling. However, the balance on current and long-term capital accountbecame a small deficit and there was a slight fall in the reserves, mainly because of the annual service of the North American loans in December.These movements are set out in the preceding table.The yeas- in perspective85. From this account it will be clear that in 1958 the United Kingdom&apos;balance of payments was highly satisfactory. This was largely becauseexternal conditions were exceptionally favourable, particularly in the first part of the year. The current surplus reached a record size, and the high level of confidence in sterling at home and overseas made possible a sub-stantial increase in the reserves.Investment in the Commonwealth86. The Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference held in Montrealin September 1958 reviewed, among other matters, the sources of capitalavailable to Commonwealth countries. It recognised the substantial partthat private capital has played, and can continue to play, not only by theprovision of funds for private enterprise in these countries, but also byassistance with the execution of their Governments&apos; development programmes.In 1958 various independent Commonwealth Governments raised  45 million on their own credit in the London market and Colonial Governments raiseda further  5 million ; the total level of net private investment in the sterling commonwealth was about  50 million higher than the average of the years1955-57. However, it has become increasingly clear that private capital,which naturally flows to those places which are likely to be most profitable,is insufficient by itself to meet the needs of the underdeveloped countries of the Commonwealth where there is a scarcity of local resources for capital development.87. The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore announced at the MontrealConference that, in addition to the funds made available through the london market and other private investment, the United Kingdom Governmentwould be prepared to make available &quot; Commonwealth Assistance Loans &quot;
fy. a Government to Government basis, to independent commonwealth countries ; these would be administered through the Exports Credits Guaran-tee Department. Assistance totalling about  50 million has been arranged for India and Pakistan and other proposals are under consideration. Atthe same time the Chancellor foreshadowed the provision being made in thenew Colonial Development and Welfare Bill for loans from Exchequerfunds to Colonial territories. The United Kingdom Government has aspecial responsibility for the Colonial territories, and to ensure a reasonablerate of development it is considered necessary to provide loans direct fromthe Exchequer to supplement loans raised by Colonial Governments on theLondon market.  (Details are given in a White Paper : Cmnd. 672).Unification of exchange rates88. Over the whole of 1958 the official exchange rate for sterling in termsof the dollar was firm. In the early months of the year it remained very near the upper limit of $282. Even in the third quarter when there is normally some pressure on sterling it was only very temporarily below themiddle official rate of $2-80. The rate for transferable sterling in foreing markets was also firm throughout the year at only a small discount fromthe official rate. At the end of 1958 the Government took advantage of the improved state of the reserves and the high level of confidence in sterling,together with the improving world economic outlook, to merge&apos; official andtransferable sterling and so unify the two rates. This move was in line withChe declared objectives of the Commonwealth Conference in September, 1958,and was taken in co-operation with other countries in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation, most of whom introduced parallelmeasures at the same time. Sterling held or acquired by non-residents of the sterling area became freely convertible into dollars at the official rate ofexchange, the margins for which remain at $2-78 $2-82, and is now knownas External Account Sterling instead of American, Canadian, Transferable orRegistered Account sterling. The policy as regards capital transfers outsidethe sterling area has, however, not altered.CHAPTER vii the ECONOMIC OUTLOOKThe present position89. From mid-1955 to mid-1958 the growth of home demand had to berestrained in order to check the rise in prices and to safeguard the country&apos;external financial position. As preceding chapters have shown, by the middleof 1958 there had been a considerable change in the economic situation:confidence in sterling had been restored, the external position was good, therewas near-stability in prices and it became clear *that there was room in the economy for expansion to be resumed. Thus in the course of the year therewas a progressive change of emphasis in economic policy. The initial allow-ances for investment were increased and the restraints which had been imposed on the economy in the preceding three years were gradually removed: byFebruary 1959 there were no longer any official restrictions on bankadvances, on hire purchase transactions or on new issues of capital, andBank Rate had been reduced from 7 per cent to 4 per cent. The Govern-ment also increased the programmes for public investment.90. By the end of the year there were signs that production had begun to move up.   Both in November and December, 1958 industrial production
229was higher than in any of the preceding six months. As Chapter III showSj.there is, however, scope for further expansion of output as well as c\Vemployment; it is the special concern of the Government to foster both. In&apos;considering how fast expansion can go ahead three points have to be kept inmind: the need to maintain a strong external position; the need for stableprices; and the need to increase employment opportunities.The external aspect91. Prospects for the balance of payments appear reasonably satisfactorybut, as chapter VI shows, the current surplus cannot be expected to be as large in 1959 as in 1958. The gradual increase in the volume of imports which began in the last quarter of 1958 is expected to continue in 1959 as expansiongets under way ; on the other hand, although the fall in world commodity prices appears to have stopped, there is so far little evidence of any increase inthe average level of the United Kingdom&apos;s import prices.92. There should be opportunities for expanding exports to manufacturingcountries as their industrial recovery gets under way. Exports to primaryproducing countries may continue to be affected for some time yet by thediminished purchasing power of these countries, especially those in the sterling area. In due course, however, they should be helped by a revival of demandfor raw materials and by an increase in loans to them from the international institutions and from other countries, including the United Kingdom. Whilethe United Kingdom&apos;s export performance as a whole was encouraging in thesecond half of 1958, there can be no doubt that competition is likely tobecome stiffer, especially in Europe as the Common Market develops. It willcontinue to be vitally important to keep export prices down. Provided exportscan be maintained, there should still be a substantial surplus on current account in 1959.93. Transactions with the International Monetary Fund will be of special importance in 1959. First, there is the repayment of  71 million out of the 200 million drawn in 1956. Secondly, the United Kingdom will be paying 58 million in gold in connection with the increase in the Fund&apos;s quota. the reserves will also be affected by gold payments of up to  40 million associatedwith the increased quotas of other members of the sterling area. In view ofall these payments to the Fund, the reserves of gold and convertible currenciesimay fall in the course of the year but so far from this giving cause for concern, the repayment of the United Kingdorn&apos;s drawing and the increasein its quota will greatly increase the facilities which the Fund can make available to this country should the need arise. The increase in the resourcesof the Fund will bring about a notable improvement in world liquidity, sofacilitating the growth of world trade on which this counitiry&apos;s prosperitydepends.Prices94. Although the increase in the general level of wages and salaries in1958 was less than in previous years it was still greater than the rise in national production and productivity. (It was also greater than the average annual increase in national production and productivity since the war.) Inthese circumstances, there was a rise in labour costs per unit of output in 1958: but in the event this was roughly offset by lower import prices.Such a fall cannot be regarded as normal. If wages and salaries (whichjmake up by far the largest part of costs) continue to rise on the scale of recent years, without a corresponding rise in productivity, the near-stability of prices recently achieved would be threatened.
W Demands oa United Kingdom resources95. The total demand upon United Kingdom resources, expressed in termsof constant prices, is expected to be higher in the year 1959 than in theyear 1958.96. Much the largest part of the total consumers&apos; demand for goods and services. With higher real incomes in 1959, and with continuing easyterms for borrowing, it is reasonable to expect the increase to be maintained.97. There will be some increase this year (against a decrease in 1958) in public authorities&apos; current expenditure. The Governmenfs current expendi-ture on goods and services, resulting from the Estimates for the financial year1959/60 presented to the House of Commons, will be about 5 per cent higherthan 1958/59: most of this increase, however, results from increases in wages,salaries and other costs which have occurred or are provided for in theEstimates. In real terms there will be little change. The current expenditureof local authorities on goods and services is likely to be appreciably higher in 1959/60 than in 1958/59, mainly because of increased provision for education.98. There will be a marked increase in public sector investment. Theaggregate of this capital expenditure of the Government, local authoritiesand nationalised industries in the financial year 1959/60 may be estimatedat around  1,600 million about 11 per cent higher in real terms than in1958/59. The course of the main programmes from 1956/57 is described in appendix B : the biggest increases in the period covered are in electricity,railways and roads. Most of the aggregate consists of long-term projects,which take a long time to prepare and mature, and which, once begun,cannot be rapidly modified without inefficiency and waste. But some arefaster-moving, and can be completed within a year or so from the time ofauthorisation.99. Private investment is unlikely to be lower in 1959 than in 1958. Onthe basis of the latest information, investment in manufacturing industry is forecast to fall by about one-tenth, but this will probably be offset by increases in other forms of private investment, notably distribution and services and housing. The removal of restrictions on credit and on issues of capital hascleared the way for expansion in this sector, which is of such importance for the future of the economy.100. In the conditions of world demand and intensified competitiondescribed above, exports will be hard to sell in 1959. It would be prudent to expect some further fall in the early part of the year but this trend shouldbe reversed in the course of it and exports should be rising towards the endof the year.101. Thus, a moderate rise in consumers&apos; demand can reasonably beexpected, and there will be increases in the aggregate of public authorities&apos;expenditure, both on current goods and services and on investment. Thecourse of private investment and exports is less certain, but there is no clear indication of a substantial change in either direction. The rate of investment in stocks can never be forecast with assurance.102. At the beginning of 1959 the United Kingdom economy is undoubtedlymuch stronger than in previous years. Demand and production are risingand the economy can afford to expand more than in the past three years.Subject to the need to maintain a strong external position and the continuanceof the recent record of price stability at home, the Government/policy is todo all it can to foster this expansion. **

Public investment consists of investment carried out by the central Govern-ment, local authorities and public corporations. Only about one-fifth of public investment is under the direct control of the Government. Local authoritiesare responsible for a little under two-fifths and public corporations chiefly the nationalised industries are responsible for rather more than two-fifths. Someinvestment, for example the road programme, is a joint responsibility of theGovernment and local authorities. The following table summarises public sector investment according to the administrative classification which differs fromthat used in National Income and Expenditure Blue Books. The reasons forthis are given in paragraphs 43-47 of this appendix. The notes on individual programmes explain the main objects and expected results of the investment being undertaken.Table 32

A large part of the National Coal board&apos;s expenditure is needed simply to replace worn out plant and to maintain production capacity. Moreover,it is necessary to provide a substantial number of new pits and to reconstructa large number of existing pits in order to ensure that the future productionof the industry comes almost entirely from fully modernised capacity. Onlyin this way can coal be placed in a position to compete effectively with otherfuels. The National Coal Board are at present reviewing their long-term plan,Investing in Coal, published in April 1956, but this is unlikely to affect theamount of investment required in 1959.Electricity  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60England and Wales			Generation:			Conventional stations ...	103	104	115Nuclear stations	21	38	57Main transmission	31	31	34Distribution       ...............	82	83	95Cost of nuclear fuel      ............	-	 	9Total   ..............	237	256	3103. At the end of 1957 the total installed generating capacity of the central electricity Generating Board, which is responsible for generation and main trans-mission, was 24,235 MW. During 1958 a further 1,152 MW of new generatingplant was brought into commission. Although this figure was considerably lessthan the total of 1,788 MW brought in in 1957, it raised installed capacity atthe end of 1958, after allowing for old plant taken out of service, to a totalof 25,369 MW, an increase of 4-7 per cent over the previous year. This was sufficient after allowing for plant out of commission by breakdown, repair andoverhaul to meet a maximum demand in 1958/59 of 20,900 MW. In 1959,a further 1,850 MW is expected to be commissioned. This should increase the netgenerating capacity available to meet peak winter demand to 22,000 MW.4. The rising expenditure on distribution, for which the Area Electricity Boardsare responsible, is mainly due to the need to carry out additional reinforcementwork for the distribution network to meet steadily increasing demand. Atthe end of 1958 there were 14-9 million consumers of all kinds, a rise of some327,000 during the year. This increase includes the connection of 11,200 farmswhich brought the total number of farms connected to the electricity system to209,000, out of a potential total of 276,000. Under the Area Boards&apos; ten-year programme, which was started in 1953, it was planned to connect 85 per cent ofthe total number of farms and it is now expected that this will be exceeded.  million	1957	1958	1959Scotland North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board South of Scotland Electricity Board   ...	17 19	15 28	15 28
Atomic Energy Authority  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60Total fixed investment     ............	56	46	468. The downturn in capital expenditure by the Atomic Energy authority is due to the approaching completion of some major projects where the peakexpenditure has now been passed, in particular the reactor stations at CalderHall and Chapelcross and the fast reactor construction work at Dounreay. Anumber of further large projects are either just being started or still beingconsidered.9. The next phase in the Authority&apos;s programme seems likely to be associatedwith a greater number of projects, large in themselves but appreciably smaller than the schemes now running towards completion. The fields of expenditure will be rather more diverse. On the one hand construction continues at theSpringfields fuel element manufacturing lines and at various process plants;this work is essentially in support of the Civil Power programme and of theAuthority&apos;s own production. On the other hand, work will progress on anumber of substantial research projects the advanced gas-cooled reactor, thenext development in the controlled thermo-nuclear reaction field, the 7 G.E.V.proton synchrotron at the National Institute for Nuclear Research, the develop-ment of the new site at Winfrifh Heath. The Authority&apos;s programme also con-tains numerous smaller research and supporting facilities at the various establish-ments. .., .-Gas  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60			Gas manufacture Distribution and consumer service       ......

This represented a rise in capacity of 9i^/ercent over the previous year. The additional capacity was needed to meetincreasing demand in the Board&apos;s own district and for export to the Southof Scotland Board to meet their peak requirements. During 1959 a further62,000 kW of new plant is expected to be commissioned, a rise of 6 per cent.6. Total sales increased in 1958 by some 7 per cent to 1,812 million units.Sales to the Board&apos;s own consumers increased by 9\ per cent to 1,349 million units.Approximately 10,000 new consumers (an increase of nearly 3 per cent) wereconnected during the year, including 1,200 farms and crofts (an increase of almost5 per cent). During the year work was started on the Board&apos;s Strathfarrarscheme.7. The South of Scotland Electricity Board commissioned 120,000 kW of new capacity in 1958 (an increase of 8 per cent) as a result of the first stage ofthe coal-fired station at Kincardine being brought into operation. The Boardexpect to commission 120,000 kW of capacity during 1959, a rise of 7 percant. Consumption increased in 1958 by about 1\ per cent, toital sales being5,990 million units. Some 25,000 new customers were connected including 960farms. 88 per cent of the farms in the Board&apos;s district are now being supplied with electricity and the Board&apos;s rural development scheme is expected to becompleted by the end of this year.
y Most of the expenditure is required to maintain existing manufacturing and distribution facilities, and for integration schemes designed to concentrate the manufacture of gas at the most efficient works. These schemes involve the laying of inter-linking mains between gas works and have enabled the numberof gas works to be halved since the industry was nationalised. The numberwill be further reduced in the next few years.11. The investment programme also includes expenditure on new processes and projects some of these are proved such as the Lurgi plant at Fife in Scotland,others are in the experimental and development stage such as the importationof liquid methane and the plant for oil hydrogenation.12. The demand for and supply of gas has remained fairly steady in recentyears and the amount produced by gasworks themselves and bought from coke ovens and other sources rose only by 1 per cent during 1958, when it amountedto 2,860 million therms. The production of coal gas and gas coke by gasworksfell between 1957 and 1958 as a result of reduced demand for coke. Cokeoutput by both gasworks and coke ovens was about 28 million tons in 1958,some 10 per cent lower than in 1957.British Transport Commission  million	1957	1958	1959Railways     ..................	124	134	178Other activities      ...............	26	27	34Total    ...............	150	161	21213. The British Transport Commission^ investment programme consists mainly of work on the railways under the modernisation plan published at the beginningof 1955. The object of this plan, as set out in the White Paper Proposals forthe Railways (Cmd. 9880) published in 1956, is to produce a more efficient andcompact railway system.14. The White Paper proposed that the railways should break even by 1961/62and the original estimate called for  900 million to be invested between 1956and 1962. The plan as a whole also included an additional  300 million worth of projects to be completed between 1963 and 1970, though it did not attempt to forecast the whole of the investment which the Commission would wish to makein the railway system during the latter period. The plan has since been re-assessed to take account of changes in price levels and certain technical decisions and is now estimated to cost  1,500 million. On 11th December 1958 the Ministerof Transport and Civil Aviation informed the House of Commons that theCommission had initiated a review of its position and prospects, and the presentfigures may therefore have to be further amended in due course.15. Examples of schemes now in progress include electrification of the linesfrom London (Femchurch Street) to Southend, from Manchester to Crewe and part of the Glasgow suburban network. During 1959 the Commission hope tocomplete work on other projects, for example, the first stage of the North Kentelectrification scheme and the new marshalling yard at Margam, and to takedelivery of large quantities of new equipment, for example, over 300 main linediesel locomotives.16. The other activities of the Commission cover the London transport executive, Road Services, docks and canals. There are considerable arrears to bemade good ; for example, the Commission need to replace a considerable partof the London Transport Executive rolling stock and its remaining trolley buses,and to continue the improvement of railway dock facilities.
Roads	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60England and Wales...............	25	50	56Scotland     ..................	4	7	1017. Expenditure on the roads is financed partly by the Government and partly by local authorities. The Governmenlt pays the cost of constructing and improv-ing trunk roads and makes grants to local authorities towards the cost of workon classified roads. Most of the current expenditure on the maintenance and repair of roads and on street lighting ( 136 million in 1957) is borne by localauthorities.18. Government capital expenditure on roads is rising steadily as part ofthe Four Year Plan announced on 22nd July, 1957. This envisaged that by1960/61 expenditure in England and Wales would rise to  60 million a yearand in Scotland to  10 million a year. Work is in progress on a number oflarge schemes such as the London/Birmingham Motorway, the Dartford/PurfleetTunnel and the Forth Bridge in Scotland. Work is also in progress on a con-siderable number of smaller, less spectacular projects designed to improve com-munioations between and within urban centres, such as the inner ring roadin Birmingham.19. About three-fifths of the capital expenditure in both 1958/59 and 1959/60is on the construction and improvement of trunk roads and two-fifths for similar work on classified roads. Since the start of the current programme about 70miles of trunk road have been built or improved in England and Wales; workon a further 200 miles is under way and work on a further 800 miles is being planned. Work on the London/Birmingham motorway will increase the amountof dual carriage-way by 110 miles, including 70 miles of motorway; the RossSpur motorway will open a further 20 miles of dual carriage-way. current and future work on the Great North Road will convert all but 35 of its 270miles into dual carriage-way.Air Corporations  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways        ...      ...      ......	39	41	4020. The investment programmes of the Air Corporations consist chiefly of progress payments for aircraft and spare parts. The investment during 1958/59and 1959/60 will provide for completion of the Corporations&apos; Britanniaand Viscount programmes and for delivery of many of the Comet aircraft on order. Payments will also be made towards the 15 Boeing 707&apos;s, 20 Vanguards,24 De Havilland 121&apos;s and 35 Vickers VC 10&apos;s which the Corporations have on order. These are needed to enable the Air Corporations to handle the growth in air traffic and for the replacement of obsolescent aircraft. The two Corpora-tions expect to fly 571 million oapacity ton miles in 1958/59 and 681 millioncapacity ton miles in 1959/60.Post Office  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60Plant.....................	85	83	79Buildings     ..................	11	11	11Other expenditure...............	5	4	4Total    ...............	101	98	94
-f\. The main purpose of the Post Office&apos;s investment programme are to providea more efficient and economical service over the whole field, to adapt the tele-phone service to changes in demand and to enable it to serve new subscribers.The investment is mainly in telephone plant and equipment and in telephone and postal buildings and vehicles.22. The telephone service has grown rapidly since the war, the number ofinstalled telephones having increased by 90 per cent from 3-9 million in 1946to 7-4 million at the end of 1958. The annual net demand for new connectionsis about 170,000/180,000. (New demands of about 400,000 in 1958/59 wereoffset by surrenders of about 240,000.) Between 1954 and the end of 1958 the waiting list for telephones has been reduced from 376,000 to 146,000, of which about half were in process of installation. The volume of traffic fluctuates. Butover the period between 1950/51 and 1957/58 local calls have increased by anannual average of 3 per cent and trunk calls by 5 per cent. This developmentcalls for a continuous investment in new cables, exchange equipment and otherspecialised plant.23. Many technical improvements are envisaged in the telephone service. Theprogramme of exchange conversions from manual to automatic working con-tinues, and in December, 1958, Bristol subscribers became the first to have thefacility of dialling trunk calls. This service will be extended and it is expectedthat, by the end of 1960, 300,000 telephones will have this facility. A further development in 1958 was the start of the automatisation of the telex service,with the opening of the automatic exchanges at Leeds and Shoreditch ; the wholetelex service should be converted to automatic working by 1961.24. The mechanisation of the postal system is continuing: the main scope for this is in its sorting offices where electronic machines are being developed for the sorting of letters and parcels and the facing of letters. The expansion and improvement of the telephone and telex services and the development of the postal system create a demand for new buildings as well as for new equipment.About 130 buildings a year are being provided at present. The Post Office fleet of vehicles now exceeds 36,000 and continues to grow.Housing	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60England and Wales			Houses started (thousands)	112	106	115Houses completed (thousands).........	131	110	105Value of work done (  million).........	239	211	220Scotland			Houses started (thousands)     .........	25-9	22-5	21-9Houses completed (thousands).........	28-3	26-7	23-3Value of work done (  million).........	50	46	4225. In the first ten years after the war the chief object of housing policy wasto overtake the severe general shortage of housing accommodation resultingfrom the war. Though this problem was still acute in some areas, the building of 2 million new permanent houses and fiats by 1955 went far to meet thecountry&apos;s general needs. Since then local authorities have been encouraged to concentrate on slum clearance and overspill building to relieve urbancongestion.26. In the autumn of 1957 the Minister of Housing announced that house-building by local authorities would be reduced by about 20 per cent as part ofthe general measure to check inflation and steps were taken to reduce thenumber of houses for which tenders were approved. During the summer of1958 it was decided to increase public investment, including house-building bylocal authorities who were invited to submit projects which could be completed within the financial year 1959/60. As a result of this measure it is expectedthat the amount of house building undertaken by local authorities during 1959/60will be about 4 per cent greater than in 1958/ 59.
-    25927. There has been a downward trend in Scotland since the peak year ofsE 3as more local authorities outside the industrial belt reach the end of ^Leircurrent programmes.

Domestic con-sumption of water rises by about 1 per cent annually and industrial demand isexpected to increase in future by between 2 and 4 per cent annually. Mostschemes take from two to three years to complete. Larger schemes may take aslong as five to ten years, making it impossible to change the rate of investmentmarkedly in the short run.29. The steady rise in investment between 1957/58 and 1959/60 is due to thelifting of restrictions imposed in 1956 on all but the most urgent schemes. work is at present in progress on a number of large schemes including the reconstruc-tion of the Thirlmere aqueduct, the Woburn Valley Sewerage scheme and the bristol Northern Stormwater sewer. In Scotland three large regional waterschemes were authorised in 1958/59. One costing over  3 million will servelarge areas in Perthshire and Clackmannan as well as industrial development inGrangemouth.Education  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60England and Wales Primary and secondary education Further education        ............

The largest is provision of primary and secondary schools. The remainder is divided between further education and a wide variety of other services and minor works. The aim of thepost-war school building programme has been to provide sufficient places (atleast 2 million) for new housing areas and the bigger school population.The latter will reach a peak of about 7 million in 1961. The years 1957/58-1959/60 mark the culmination of this effort. About two-thirds of the work being done in these years is on new secondary schools. The total value of majorprimary and secondary projects to be started in these years is  53 million, 51 million and  46 million respectively.
f. With the completion of this major phase of post-war school building insig t; a start can be made in 1960/61 on the ambitious five-year programmeof improvements to existing schools announced in the recent White PaperSecondary Education for All A New Drive (Cmnd. 604). Rural reorganisation(that is, the elimination of all-age schools, usually by building a new secondary school to take senior pupils from a number of rural primary schools which havehitherto had to accommodate children over the age of eleven) which had to be suspended in 1958 and 1959, will be completed. The corresponding reorganisa-tion of secondary schools in cities and towns will be substantially achieved.The provision of improved science accommodation will be accelerated and agood start made on the rehabilitation of old and unsatisfactory schools.32. Investment for further education consists mainly of building new colleges and major extensions to them, with special emphasis on the expansion of facilitiesfor advanced technological education. The White Paper on Technical Education,published in February 1956 (Cmd. 9703), announced a building programme of 70 million in England and Wales for the five years 1956 to 1961. New projectsincluded in that programme are now starting at a rate of about  15 million ayear.33. The remaining expenditure in England and Wales covers major projects for special schools for handicapped children and for teacher training colleges, and minor projects for all parts of the educational service, includingthe school meals service. In 1959/60 expenditure will rise to about  23 million,about  18 million of which will be on minor works. Most of the remainderwill be on the first stages of the recently announced building programme toprovide by September 1962 12,000 new places in teacher training colleges andso expand existing capacity by 50 per cent.34. The pattern of investment in Scotland is similar to that in England andWales, with the bulk of the expenditure going on primary and secondary education. 1959/60 will be the peak year for building new schools to accom-accommodate both increased numbers and children in new housing areas. As demandfor new places slackens off thereafter, a growing share of investment will be devoted to the improvement of conditions at old schools.35. The  10 million programme of investment in Scottish technical educationannounced in the 1956 White Paper has taken longer to get under way than was expected, largely because of unforeseen difficulties of siting and planning.In 1958/59 projects costing  1-3 million were started; projects estimated to costa further  3-5 million are likely to be started in 1959/60.University Grants Committee			  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60			Total investment   ...............	10	14	1836. Non-recurrent grants to Universities are made for the erection of new and the adaptation of existing buildings, equipment for new accommodation,and the purchase of sites and properties. This expenditure is required to make good obsolescence and relieve overcrowding, and to provide for the risingnumbers of undergraduates. The university building programme for the threeyears 1957/59 includes buildings to accommodate teaching and research, andgeneral service buildings such as libraries, student unions, refectories and hallsof residence. Of the buildings to accommodate teaching and research, over90 per cent are for scientific subjects, including medicine and technology.Major projects under construction include engineering buildings in Birmingham,Leeds, Liverpool, London and Nottingham; science buildings in Cambridge,Leicester, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Aberystwyth; and halls of residence in Bristol, Durham, Leicester and Aberdeen.

The hospital building programme in England and Wales has severalobjects: to provide more beds in areas where there is a shortage for all or particular classes of treatment; to reduce overcrowding ; to improve and increasethe facilities for treatment by providing new operating theatres, X*ay depart-ments and laboratories, and to improve the efficiency of the hospital service byreplacing obsolete plant and equipment.38. By the end of 1958 36 major projects with an estimated total cost of 28 million had been started under the programme announced in 1955 andsubsequently expanded. These include the first phases of new hospitals atHarlow, Grawiey and Cambridge. During 1958 the first stages of new mental deficiency hospitals at Southport and Balderton (near Newark) were ooimpletedand the out-patient department at Lewisham Hospital came into use. major schemes oh which work is in hand include a new accident wing for the general hospital, Middlesbrough, a new hospital at Welwyn, a new surgical block atGuy&apos;s Hospital, and the first phases of new hospitals at Huddersfield, Hensing-ham in West Cumberland, Sheffield, Swansea and Swindon. Hospital Boardsare planning over 70 further major schemes as well as many smaller schemes.39. The main objects of the Scottish hospital programme are the same as inEngland and Wales. Thirteen major schemes costing over  250,000 each areat present in progress. All of these will be continuing in 1959/60 ; among themextension of the Victoria Hospital at Kirkcaldy, a new maternity hospital atBellshill, radio-therapy developments at Glasgow, and, in the Dundee district,improvements at Westgreen Mental Hospital and extension of BaldovanInstitution. One new major scheme is expected to start in 1959/60, a newmaternity hospital in Glasgow costing  900,000.Miscellaneous public investment  million	1957/58	1958/59	1959/60Government sector ...      ............ Local authority sector     ............ Public corporations        ............	58 57 6	53 63 6	65 78 5Total    ...............	121	122	14840. The main central government programmes are government building, borne on the Ministry of Works Vote (about  6 million in 1958/59), capital expenditure at Ordnance Factories and in aid of other research and development, borne on Ministry of Supply Votes (about  24 million in 1958/59), and service departments&apos; expenditure on housing for the Armed Forces (about  5 million in1958/59).41. The miscellaneous local authority programmes cover a wide field unclassified roads and public lighting (about  6 million in 1958/59); local
af/) rity health and welfare services (about  5 million in 1958/59); housing forthe police and fire services; children&apos;s homes and coast protection.42. The miscellaneous public corporations programmes consist of investment by tine British Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent television authority.Statistical note43. The investment programmes referred to in preceding paragraphs and summarised in table 32 differ from those quoted in paragraphs 20 to 24 ofthe Survey and published in the Blue Book National Income and Expenditure,1958, Tables 43, 45, 48, 55 and 61. There are differences in coverage, approach and timing. The Blue Book definition is rather wider and produces a largertotal figure, about  100 million more in 1957.44. The first difference is that the Blue Book covers investment in assetsowned by the public sector of the economy whereas the administrative classifica-tion relates to investment which relies for external financing on Governmentfunds or Government credit. Public investment financed by the Governmentof Northern Ireland (about  35 million in 1957) is therefore included in the blue 3ook, but excluded under the administrative classification since this invest-ment is financed by the Northern Ireland Government. Similarly capitalexpenditure by private bodies financed from public funds is included in theadministrative classification, but excluded from the Blue Book. A particularexample is the universities, which received capital grants of some  10 million from public funds in 1957. An exception to this is investment by iron andsteel companies still publicly owned about  13 million in 1957 which for practical purposes can most conveniently be classified among private investment.45. The second difference is that the Blue Book shows capital expenditureboth on the creation of new assets and on the transfer of existing assets,whereas the administrative classification is mainly restricted to investment which represents a claim on new resources. The Blue Book therefore includes, andthe administrative classification excludes, net expenditure on the purchase ofland and existing buildings ; about  33 million in 1957.46. The third difference is timing. The Blue Book figures are on a calendar year basis, while those under the administrative classification normally relateto an accounting year. For most public bodies this runs from April to March,but in the case of the British Transport Commission, the National Coal Boardand the Scottish Electricity Boards the relevant accounting period is the calendar year. A timing adjustment (amounting to  13 million in 1958/59) is thereforeneeded in order to bring all the programmes to a common total.47. The final difference is that the administrative classification excludes expendi-ture which cannot be estimated accurately in advance such as expenditure onarchitects&apos; and surveyors&apos; fees for new schools.(31764)   Wt. 1264-1758   180   3/59   d.l.
