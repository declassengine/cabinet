(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 3 COPY NO. M-^14th January, 1959CABINETCOMMERCIAL, POLICY;  HORTICULTUREMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodIntroductionOn 25th November the Cabinet invited me, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to prepare a scheme for providingfinancial assistance to horticulture on a basis similar to that adoptedin the case of agriculture and decided that meanwhile there should beno announcement about the pending applications for increases in the horticultural tariffs (C.C.(58) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 5).   Afterconsultation with the Chancellor, I now put forward the following broadproposals.   The scope of the scheme is set out more fully in theAppendix.The kind of assistance needed by horticulture2.     Efficiency in growing has made considerable strides in recentyears.   But it has not been matched by equal progress in preparation for the market and marketing.   Therefore the main emphasis in anyplan to make our horticulture more competitive should be on bettermarketing.The main features of my proposals3,     (a)  To improve marketing, grants would be made towards thecost of equipping horticultural holdings with machinery for the washing,grading, cooling and storing of produce to enable it to be more profitablymarketed; also for buildings to house such equipment and for other works to increase the general efficiency of the holdings.(b) For small growers (i.e. those under 10 acres) withoutglass, grants would also be made towards the cost of providing smallareas of ancillary glass.   This is needed, not for glasshouse praduction,but to give growers a wider choice and greater control over the timing of outdoor crops.   With a longer period of marketing and a wider range of production, the risk of gluts is reduced.   This is the best way of improving the efficiency of these small businesses.(c) For the glasshouse industry, which has been more severely affected than any other sector of horticulture by rising costs -particularly of fuel and labour, grants towards the cost of modernising-1-
:heating installations in commercial glasshouses and the strengthening of a service of technical advice.  This will directly reduce costs ofproduction.(d) As the best solution to the marketing problems of manygroups of small producers, the encouragement of growers&apos; co-operativemarketing organisations by means of grants on terms broadly similarto those available to individuals, together with small grants to a central organisation to facilitate the setting up,and improve the management of,co-operative groups.Relations with the Farm Improvement Scheme (F.I.S.:)4,     Some of the works and buildings to be grant-aided under thisscheme would be of a type eligible for aid under the F.I.S.;  someapplications of this kind have already been received and approved under that Scheme.   To simplify administration I propose to transfer to thescheme for horticulture all appropriate items already included in theF.I.S. Some expenditure that would otherwise fall on the F.I.S. will therefore be transferred to the scheme for horticulture.Rates of grant5.     The rate of grant I propose for all the items included in thescheme is 33j per cent of the approved expenditure - the same rate as in the F.I.S.The estimated cost of the scheme.     The best estimate that I can make of the additional expenditure which the scheme would involve is S.l\ millions which, spread over theperiod of five years for which I propose it should run, represents anannual rate of  l  millions.   The total disbursement would be 8 millions but of this,  500,000 represents expenditure that would be incurred in any event under the F.I.S.Eligibility7.     Grants would be available only to established horticulturalbusinesses big enough to provide full-time occupation and a reasonableliving for at least one roan.   I estimate that some 45,000 holdings willbe eligible for assistance of which about half will apply for help.   all sections of the industry would benefit from the scheme.Administration and staff8.     Administration of the scheme would follow the lines of the F.I.S.;the technical work would fall primarily on the horticultural officers ofthe National Agricultural Advisory Service, who without too gr jat a slowing down of their current work would be able to undertake it, butalso in some part on the Agricultural Land Service, which might needsome small further strengthening.   In addition, most divisional officeswould need one or two extra staff, to a total of about sixty.if

Some expenditure that would otherwise fall on the F.I.S. will therefore be transferred to the scheme for horticulture.Rates of grant5.      The rate of grant 1 propose for all the items included in thescheme is 33^ per cent of the approved expenditure - the same rate as in the F.I.S.The estimated cost of the scheme.      The best estimate that 1 can make of the additional expenditure which the scheme would involve is S.l\ millions which, spread over theperiod of five years for which 1 propose it should run, represents anannual rate of  1-^ millions.   The total disbursement would be 8 millions but of this,  500,000 represents expenditure that would be incurred in any event under the F.1..S.Eligibility7.     Grants would be available only to established horticulturalbusinesses big enough to provide full-time occupation and a reasonableliving for at least one man.   I estimate that some 45,000 holdings willbe eligible for assistance of which about half will apply for help.   all sections of the industry would benefit from the scheme.Administration and staff8.      Administration of the scheme would follow the lines of the F.I.S.;the technical work would fall primarily on the horticultural officers ofthe National Agricultural Advisory Service, who without too great a slowing down of their current work would be able to undertake it, butalso in some part on the Agricultural Land Service, which might needsome small further strengthening.   In addition, most divisional officeswould need one or two extra staff, to a total of about sixty.
Relation to proposed Horticultural Marketing Council9.      My colleagues will recall that I set up last summer aHorticultural Marketing Advisory Council, the most important task ofwhich is to prepare agreed plans for a permanent marketing councilto be financed out of funds provided by the industry itself.   If my present proposals are approved, I would propose to use the approvalas a spur to secure the early agreement of retailers, wholesalers andgrowers to an industry-financed marketing council.C onclusion10.     If it is finally decided to reject the tariff applications,   i accordingly ask my colleagues to agree:-(i)    to the introduction of a scheme of aid for horticultureon the above lines;(ii)    that I should be authorised to announce as soon as possiblethe Governmenfs intention to introduce the legislation necessary for a scheme of this kind;   and to add that theGovernment will be inviting the leaders of the industryto enter into confidential discussions at an early date on the details of the scheme.J.H.Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, S.W.I.13th January, 1959
APPENDIXEligibilityGrant-aid would be restricted to horticultural businessesProviding full-time employment for at least one man, or the equivalent,which would be defined as have at least one-fifth acre of glass or fouracres of orchard fruit, soft fruit, or land under intensive cultivation of vegetables or flowers, or any combination of these amounting to four acres.   Intensive cultivation would be defined so as to require a minimum number of crops for a period of perhaps two years.   Anacre of glass would be considered equal to twenty acres of land underoutdoor crops.Projects to be grant-aided2. (a) Works, land, buildings, etc. (of the types grant-aided underthe Farm Improvement Scheme (F.I.S.)):.-(i)   Erecting, altering, enlarging or reconditioningpermanent buildings on horticultural holdings, used inconnection with the production, storage, preparation formarket, and packing of horticultural produce.(ii) Making and improving of roads, loading platformsand ramps, bridges, permanent fences (including hedges),shelter belts, walls and gates.(iii) Provision and laying on of electricity.(iv) Works required for the safety, health, and welfare of horticultural workers.(v) Grubbing up of orchards, removal of hedges and banks,filling in of ditches, removal of boulders, tree roots, andother like obstructions to cultivation.(b) Plant and equipment:-(i)   Insulation and plant for the control of temperaturein storage buildings or parts of buildings, including gas stores.(ii)   Equipment and fittings for packing sheds, includingshelving, benching, conveyors, washing and grading plant andpresses.(c) Commercial glasshouses;   Modernising heating equipment in existing glasshouses which on technical examination is found to bebelow prescribed standards of efficiency in terms of the use of fuel,stoking labour, and temperature control. . Advice on these matterswould be expanded.
