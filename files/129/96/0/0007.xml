SECRET^   THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1959C (59) 7 Copy No.    5 920th January, 1959CABINETCOMMONWEALTH immigrants memorandum by the lord chancellor on 8th September, 1958, the Cabinet invited the Home Secretary, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor, to give further consideration to thedesirability of taking statutory powers to deport undesirable immigrants fromother countries of the Commonwealth (C.C. (58) 69th Conclusions, Minute 3,Conclusion (2)). At the request of the Home Secretary this question has beenconsidered by the Committee on Colonial Immigrants, and on their behalf I nowreport our conclusions.The problem. Two main aspects of the problem of coloured immigration give rise to public concern (i) The large numbers of immigrants arriving in this country and theirconcentration in particular areas, with all the attendant social problems; and(ii) The criminal activities of a comparatively small number of theseimmigrants.Numbers Arriving3. As regards (i), the flow of coloured immigrants to the United kingdom is much reduced. During the last quarter of 1958 the net total of arrivals (i.e., after making allowance for those leaving the United Kingdom) from the West Indieswas 1,373 compared with 7,074 in the same period of 1957 and 3,322 in 1956.Arrivals from India fell to 940 in this period, compared with 1,508 in the sameperiod of 1957. The position regarding Pakistan is most satisfactory1 a netdecrease of 174 in this period compared with a net increase of 2,243 in the sameperiod in 1957. Overall, the picture of coloured immigration is reasonably satisfactory, the highest figure in recent months being 3,297 for September lastcompared with 7,751 in September 1957. In December 1958 there was for thefirst time in recent years a net decrease in coloured immigration.4. The reduction in the flow of coloured immigration, particularly from theWest Indies, must owe much to the efforts made by the overseas governments to discourage emigrants from setting out, both by administrative controls and bypropaganda. In particular, the falling off of West Indian arrivals is probably due, in large measure, to the results of our discussions with Mr. Manley, theJamaican Chief Minister and Minister of Development. The reduced prospects of finding employment in the United Kingdom have probably also had an effect.Except in the areas where coloured immigrants have congregated, public opinionon the subject of coloured immigration seems to have subsided since the racialdisturbances.  We have no evidence of any disputes between white and colouredSECRET54623 b
people resulting from competition for employment, and coloured people are apparently not finding it relatively more difficult than white people to get jobs.There seems no pressing demand for the imposition of controls over the numberof immigrants arriving in this country; in any case such controls could be effectedonly by major legislation, which clearly cannot be contemplated in the present parliament. We recommend however that the possibility of a comprehensiveImmigration Bill dealing with aliens as well as Commonwealth immigrants shouldbe studied, as suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 (vi) of our earlier report (C. (58) 129).Powers to Deport Undesirables5. Although the real problem is in the numbers of colonial immigrants whoarrive in this country, public opinion tends to focus attention on the criminalactivities of a small minority in particular on those convicted of living onimmoral earnings. Whilst this aspect of the problem is undoubtedly inflated outof all proportion, the Committee feel that the publicity given to these convictionstends to bring the whole coloured community into disrepute. They have thereforestudied the desirability of introducing legislation to give powers to the HomeSecretary to order undesirable immigrants to be deported.6.   There are three alternative courses open to us (i) To legislate for the deportation of undesirable Commonwealth and colonial immigrants immediately.(ii) To prepare a Bill, but introduce it only if events make it unavoidable.(iii) To leave the question to be dealt with in due course as part of comprehensive legislation regarding immigrants generally.7.   The arguments in favour of immediate legislation are as follows (i) It would go some way to meet the widespread public anxiety, about theincrease in crime.Since feelings against the whole coloured community are exacerbated bythe activities of a few, powers to deport the offenders would tend toimprove race relationships.Failure of the Government to take action would encourage the formationof extremist groups in the United Kingdom and would discourageColonial Governments from pursuing policies of restricting emigrationto the United Kingdom.Th. ? introduction of a Bill has been foreshadowed in Ministerial statements and the public is expecting the Government to take some action.Failure to take action might react unfavourably on the Government^popularity.It would be better for the Government to take the initiative and introduce legislation as a result of mature consideration of the problem, ratherthan to wait until more race riots compelled its hurried introduction,possibly in a more drastic form, to meet an urgent public demand.If legislation were confined to conferring powers to deport on therecommendation of a Court, there would be little likelihood of opposition in Parliament.8.   The arguments against introducing legislation are (i) It would draw a distinction between the British subject from overseas and the British subject domiciled in this country; as such it could berepresented as being a major departure from principle.(ii) The race riots have died down, at any rate for the present, and there isno great popular demand for legislation to deport a few undesirableimmigrants.(iii) The measure might be criticised as failing to deal with the real problem that of limiting the number of immigrants.(iv) It might provoke criticism from certain Colonial territories.(v) There is need for a comprehensive Immigration Bill, and separate legislation for Colonial immigrants might have the effect of delaying forsome years the introduction of such a Bill.
The Bill12. In order to assist our colleagues we have considered what a deportationBill should contain and have had the attached draft Bill prepared. We have takeninfo consideration the annexed report by officials which recommends (paragraph 18)that any legislation authorising the deportation of British subjects should contain the following provisions (a) Power to the Secretary of State to deport from the United Kingdom any british subject or citizen of the Irish Republic who is recommended for deportation by a Court upon conviction of an offence for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, or of an offence relatingto prostitution.(b) Exemption of any persons coming within the categories set out inparagraph 6 of the report.(c) Power to the police to arrest and detain any person found in the UnitedKingdom in contravention of a deportation order.id) Penalties for contravention of deportation orders.Officials feel (paragraph 19) that the balance of advantage lies againstthe inclusion of the following provisions:(e) Power to deport persons who are culpably dependent on public funds,other than those recommended on conviction under Section 51 of theNational Assistance Act.(/) Power to deport persons whose deportation appears to the Secretary ofState to be necessary for security reasons or otherwise conducive tothe public good.(g) Provision for independent review of cases under (e) or (/).(h) Amendment of the registration provisions of the British Nationality Act,1948.(/) Powers to immigration officers to refuse leave to land to persons against whom deportation orders are in force and for this purpose to examineBritish subjects entering the country.13. We agree generally with these recommendations. For the purpose ofthe Bill &quot; undesirability&quot; is taken to attach only to persons who have been recommended for deportation by a Court on conviction of an offence for whichthe Court had power to impose a sentence of imprisonment or for certain definedoffences relating to prostitution. We have considered whether the Courts shouldbe empowered themselves to order deportation, but we think it preferable thatdiscretion in this matter should rest with the Secretary of State.14. For presentational reasons we recommend that citizens of the irish republic should be liable under the Bill to deportation from the United Kingdom9. The suggestion that a Bill should be prepared and held ready for introduction if circumstances made it necessary (paragraph 6 (ii)) meets some ofthe objections to immediate legislation but does not overcome the difficulty thatif the Bill had to be introduced, it would be clear that the Government had been driven to it by force of events instead of acting after mature and carefulconsideration.10. Although the majority of the Committee on Colonial Immigrants is infavour of introducing a Bill in this Parliament, the Committee are not unanimouson the matter, and we submit it to the Cabinet for decision.11. Before any announcement were made about introducing a Bill it wouldbe necessary to consult other Commonwealth and Colonial Governments (andto forewarn the Government of the Irish Republic) since the legislation wouldinvolve departure from our traditional policy under which Commonwealth citizenshave the right to remain here indefinitely. The co-operation of commonwealth governments would also be necessary in administering the Act. The best course might therefore be to defer coming to a final decision on the matter until the attitudeof Commonwealth Governments is known.
in the same circumstances as British subjects, but we recognise that in practice,although they could be deported without difficulty, it would be impossible to preventtheir re-entry.15.  As regards exemption we agree with the proposals set out in paragraph of the Officials&apos; Report, subject to the following modifications:  (a) a person whose father was born in the United Kingdom should also be exempt since many persons born abroad of fathers who were born inthe United Kingdom have very close connections with this country andwould, on return to what they regard as &quot; home,&quot; strongly object to being classed as &quot; deportable &quot;;(b) the period of residence during which a person would be liable to deportationshould be five years instead of seven years since we feel it would beimpossible to defend the longer period when aliens can acquirenaturalisation after five years&apos; residence;(c) the model Colonial Ordinance provides (paragraph 6 id) of the Officials&apos;Report) for deportation at the motion of the Executive of a child under18. It seems better, however, where the initiative comes from a Court,to exempt all persons appearing to be under 17, who might be dealtwith by a juvenile court, and this has been achieved by the openingwords of Section 1 (3) of the Bill. If a person over that age seems tothe Court to merit deportation, he has no strong claim to exemption from deportation merely because one of his parents has, for example,been resident more than five years in the United Kingdom.16. The retention of a qualifying period of five years for exemption on grounds of residence or domicile will, however, unfortunately perpetuate ananomaly, since under Section 6 (1) of the British Nationality Act a citizen of a commonwealth country or of the Irish Republic is entitled to be registered asa citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies after only 12 months&apos; residence here.Immigrants from, for instance, India and Pakistan, can therefore secure themselvesimmunity from deportation after one year&apos;s residence here by claiming registrationas citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. However, the only way ofrectifying this anomaly would be to amend the British Nationality Act, 1948, whichwould be bound to be controversial and could not in any event be undertaken without full consultation with all the Commonwealth countries. We are satisfiedthat in these circumstances the anomaly must be allowed to remain.Conclusion17.   We invite the Cabinet to decide:  (i) Whether,   subject   to   possible   reconsideration   after   the  views   of commonwealth Governments have been obtained, early legislation isto be introduced to provide powers to deport undesirable immigrants.(ii) If not, whether a Bill should nevertheless be prepared but not introducedunless circumstances make it essential.(iii) If a Bill is to be prepared, whether, subject to its consideration by theLegislation Committee, the attached draft is broadly suitable.(iv) That the possibility of drawing up a comprehensive Immigration Bill, onthe lines indicated in our earlier report (paragraphs 8 and 9 (vi) ofC. (58) 129), should be studied though not for introduction in the life ofthe present Parliament.K.Lord Chancellors Department, S.W. 1,19th January, 1959.
ANNEXCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRANTSReport by OfficialsDeportation of British Subjects from the United kingdom on the 8th September, 1958, the Cabinet (C.C. (58) 69th Conclusions, item 3)invited the Home Secretary (1) in consultation with other Ministers, to consider an approach to theFederal Government of the West Indies on the control of emigrationfrom the West Indian territories, and(2) in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, to give further consideration tothe desirability of taking statutory powers to deport undesirableimmigrants from other countries of the Commonwealth.2. It is understood that action on (1) has now been taken. The following report deals with the second of these two issues and brings up to date the discussionof the practical questions involved. The questions which would need to be decidedbefore legislation was introduced fall under the following headings:  (1) Arrangements with other Commonwealth (including Colonial) countries.(2) Application to the Irish Republic.(3) Registration under the British Nationality Act, 1948.(4) Classes of persons to be regarded as not liable to deportation.(5) The grounds on which deportation might be effected.(6) Appeals against deportation.(7) Re-entry of deported persons.(1) Arrangements with other Commonwealth Countries3. It would be necessary to consult Governments of other commonwealth countries at an appropriate stage before legislation involving the deportation ofBritish subjects not belonging to the United Kingdom is introduced. This would bedesirable for two reasons :  First, an individual cannot be deported from this country unless there is someother country willing to receive him. We must therefore reach a general understanding with the Governments of other Commonwealth countries (and theColonies) that they would agree to accept people who &quot; belong &quot; to them who maybe deported from here. In spite of such general understanding, however, there might be difficulties in practice in deporting from this country citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies even though they were also citizens of other commonwealth countries.Second, it would be prudent to ascertain, before introducing legislation, thatthere would be no untoward reactions from any Commonwealth Government. Inthis connection their own power to deport people belonging to this country is relevant. A summary of the powers of other Commonwealth Governments and theGovernment of the Irish Republic to deport British subjects is contained inAppendix A to this Report. It will be seen that these powers vary considerably from one Commonwealth country to another, ranging from fairly full powers insome Commonwealth countries such as South Africa, Ceylon, Ghana and the
Federation of Malaya to a virtual absence of any powers in New Zealand and complete absence in the Irish Republic. Moreover, in India and Pakistan, thoughthe scope of the powers might look fairly wide on paper, it is understood that thelegislation is not applied to persons belonging to the United Kingdom save in exceptional circumstances. It is possible, therefore, that legislation of the kindsuggested in this country might encourage some Commonwealth Governments totake a leaf out of our book by either taking more extensive powers to deport UnitedKingdom citizens or by applying more widely powers they already possess.Moreover, the Government of India, even if it did not apply the existing deportationpowers more rigorously against people from this country might retaliate possiblyunder the pressure of public opinion by requiring United Kingdom citizens tosubmit to troublesome immigration controls or to register with the police. TheCommonwealth Relations Office do not rate any of these dangers very high, but would like to consult United Kingdom High Commissioners quickly to ascertain whether they share this view.(2) Application to the Irish Republic4. An important question which would have to be decided is whether the suggested legislation should apply to citizens of the Irish Republic. While there areweighty practical reasons for excluding citizens of the Irish Republic from anygeneral restriction on immigration, it would be difficult to justify the exemption ofsuch citizens from a liability to deportation which applied to British subjects from commonwealth countries. It must be recognised that if the Irish were included theresult might be that orders would be made against more Irish than all Britishimmigrants put together. There would be special difficulty in preventing the return from Ireland of citizens of the Republic, but in a lesser degree this problem applies to other territories (see paragraph 16 below). The possibility would also have to be faced that deportations from Northern Ireland to the Republic might create badfeeling in the Republic; but there should be sufficient safeguard in the fact that thepower of deportation in such cases would be exercisable not by the Government ofNorthern Ireland but by the Secretary of State.(3) Registration under the British Nationalities Act, 19485. A point of some difficulty is presented by section 6 (1) of the british nationality Act, which entitles a citizen of any other Commonwealth country or ofthe Irish Republic to be registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniesafter twelve months&apos; residence here; under the law of most other commonwealth countries such registration deprives such a person of his other citizenship and thiswould render him in practice immune from deportation. It would seem anomalousthat immigrants from the Colonies should have to live here for seven years (seeparagraph 6 below), before they could gain immunity from deportation, whereasimmigrants from, for instance, India and Pakistan could secure themselves suchpractical immunity after only a year; and the anomaly is likely to become greateras more and more colonies achieve independence. On the other hand, it was partof the 1947 citizenship agreement that as much content as possible should be givento the common status of British subject and this country has always recommended to other Commonwealth countries that one way to do this is to make it much easier for citizens of one Commonwealth country to acquire citizenship of another than for aliens to be naturalised. It would be a retrograde step for the United kingdom to require citizens of other Commonwealth countries to wait seven or even five years before they could acquire citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies. (Fiveyears is the qualifying period for aliens.) Moreover many British subjects who aretechnically citizens of other Commonwealth countries (and particularly of the &quot; oldDominions &quot;) but regard themselves as belonging to the United Kingdom woulddeeply resent the removal of the right to acquire United Kingdom citizenship soon after taking up residence here. The alternative of reserving to the Secretary of Statediscretion to register suitable immigrants after one year would be objectionable and difficult to administer, as it would put all applicants to the necessity of a policeinquiry into their character. It may be thought better to put up with the anomalythan to include in the Bill an amendment of the British Nationality Act which wouldbe bound to be controversial.
(4) Exemptions from Liability to Deportation6. It would be necessary to exempt from liability to deportation Britishsubjects and citizens of the Irish Republic who &quot; belong &quot; to the United Kingdom.The Colonial Office has consistently recommended to colonial Governments that persons &quot; belonging &quot; to a territory should not be deported from it; and broadly speaking, if the lead given by the Colonial Office in their Model Colonial Ordinance*were followed, a person would not be liable to deportation from the United Kingdomif he or she (a) was born in the United Kingdom or was born of parents who at the timeof his or her birth were ordinarily resident here; or(b) had been ordinarily resident or domiciled in the United Kingdomcontinuously for a period of seven years or more and had not since theend of that period been resident continuously for a period of seven years or more in any other part of the Commonwealth; or(c) was naturalised in this country; or(d) was the wife or minor child of a person falling within the foregoing classes.7. There are factors which might suggest that the period of seven years during which a person would be liable to deportation is too long. In comparisonwith those other Commonwealth countries which have powers of deportation, theproposal might appear excessive Australia and Canada for example are powerlessto deport in many cases after five years and the question of retaliation must beborne in mind. The United Kingdom is, moreover, a party to the EuropeanConvention on Social and Medical Assistance (Cmd. 9180) under which the contracting countries have agreed not to deport each other&quot;s nationals on grounds of destitution after five years&apos; residence. On the other hand, strong reasons wouldbe needed to justify the United Kingdom in departing from the period which ithad recommended to the Colonies; and it is worth bearing in mind that large-scalecolonial immigration into the United Kingdom started in 1952, so that manyimmigrants would be outside the scope of legislation from the outset if the period after which &quot; immunity &quot; from deportation is acquired is to be less than seven years.   (There could hardly be a question of legislation having retrospective effect.)8. We accordingly recommend that the exemptions should be defined as inparagraph 6 above.(5) Grounds for Deportation9. The recent Cabinet conclusions referred simply to &quot; undesirableimmigrants.&quot; The present Report, like that of 1954, considers &quot; undesirabiilty &quot;under the three heads of person who (a) have been convicted of offences,(b) are considered undesirable by executive decision, or- (c) are living on public funds.(a) Conviction of Offences10. The strongest candidates for liability to deportation would undoubtedly be those persons who had been convicted of certain criminal offences. TheWorking Party does not consider it feasible to draw up a list of those offences, orpenalties imposed, which would render a person liable. The most practical coursewould, it is suggested, be to follow in this respect the Aliens Order and allow theSecretary of State discretion to deport any non-exempted British subject or citizen of the Irish Republic who had been recommended for deportation by a court on conviction for an offence for which the court had power to impose a sentence of imprisonment or for certain defined offences relating to prostitution.11. It is arguable that the Secretary of State ought not to be circumscribedby the necessity of a court recommendation, but should be free to order the deportation of any person convicted of such an offence as described.   No doubt in* A summary of the categories of person dealt with in the Model Ordinance and of the procedure in deportation from colonial territories is included as Appendix B to this Report.
some cases which would otherwise be thought to merit deportation the court willomit to make a recommendation; but the precedent of the Aliens Order stands,and it would be difficult to defend the wider alternative on the ground that thecourts could not be trusted to make recommendations in suitable cases.(b) Undesirability12. Under the Aliens Order the Secretary of State has also power to deportany alien whose deportation he deems conducive to the public good. Apart fromcases where deportation is used as the ultimate sanction to enforce a decision bythe Secretary of State that an alien shall leave the country, deportations under this second heading fall mostly into the categories where the person is (1) a security risk, or(2) a danger to public morals.In dealing with aliens neither category has been found to be numerous in comparison with the total number of aliens deported: the security cases are rare;and there is often great difficulty in assembling a case against those who are thought to be offending but have escaped conviction. There is no reason to think that theposition would be dissimilar if such a wide measure of discretion were to beemployed against British subjects. The recommendation of the Working Party isthat it is not worth attempting to proceed against those who have not been convictedby a court in the circumstances set out in paragraph 10 and whose deportation hasnot been recommended by a court.(c) Dependence on Public Funds13. Equally we do not recommend that dependence on public funds shouldbe of itself a ground for deportation. The great majority of immigrants have cometo the United Kingdom not to subsist upon public funds, but to work and supportthemselves. It would be difficult to justify deportation of any such person merely because, in effect, he had not found the opportunities he anticipated or had fallensick and could not work. It is not the practice to deport aliens on the mere ground of dependence on public funds, and it would be indefensible to treat British subjectsmore severely than aliens. Where there is real culpability the National AssistanceAct (Section 51) enables a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment on a person who persistently refuses or neglects to maintain himself or his dependants; sucha person would, if recommended by a court, be liable to deportation on grounds ofhis conviction.(6) Appeal Machinery14. If the grounds for deportation were defined as cuggested in the previous paragraph, no special appeal machinery would be necess if the convicted personcan appeal to a higher court against a recommendation deportation just as hecan do against sentence. So far as concerns England a. . Vales we understandthat in indictable cases the sentence (against which any person convicted onindictment may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal with the leave of thatCourt) includes any recommendation of the court as to the making of an expulsionorder (Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, Sections 3 and 21). So far as aliens areconcerned, an appeal is in practice provided in most other cases by Article 20 (3)of the Aliens Order which provides that in any case in which a court has recommended deportation and there is appeal against conviction or sentence, ifthe higher court certifies that it does not concur in the recommendation for deportation, that recommendation shall have no effect. Since in England andWales there is always an appeal from any sentence imposed by magistrates&apos; courts,the enactment as regards British subjects of a provision parallel to this provision in the Aliens Order would provide for a judicial review of all recommendations for deportation except in those fairly infrequent cases where (a) the court of summary jurisdiction made a recommendation for deportationwithout imposing any sentence; or(b) where the defendant did not wish to put his sentence in issue again, butonly   to   appeal   against   the   court   of   summary   jurisdiction^recommendation for deportation.
If it were desired to cover all cases without exception, it would seem necessary toinclude in the Bill a provision enabling a recommendation for deportation to beappealed against to a higher court, whatever court made the recommendation andwhether or not there was an appeal against sentence.15.   We understand the position in Scotland may need special consideration.(7) Re-entry of Deported Persons16. Under present arrangements and existing law it would be difficult toprevent a British subject or citizen of the Irish Republic, who had been deported,from re-entering the United Kingdom. The only complete safeguard would be to empower immigration officers at ports to examine all persons entering the country.Even if no attempt were made to control the Irish traffic, such a course would call for an increase in the complement of immigration officers if British travellers werenot to be subjected to delays at the ports, and at some ports delays could not be avoided altogether.17. A lesser safeguard, but one which, in the circumstances, might be thoughtacceptable, would lie in the following measures:  (1) The overseas Government concerned would be told of a deportation and invited to take what measures it could to prevent the person&apos;s return.(2) Power could be taken for the police to arrest and detain anyone found inthe United Kingdom in contravention of an order. Such a person wouldbe guilty of an offence and on conviction could be recommended again for deportation.Summary18. The Working Party accordingly recommends that any legislation authorising the deportation of British subjects should contain the following provisions:  (1) Power to the Secretary of State to deport from the United Kingdom any british subject or citizen of the Irish Republic who is recommended for deportation by a court upon conviction of an offence for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, or of an offence relatingto prostitution.(2) Exemption of any persons coming within the categories set out inparagraph 6 above.(3) Power to the police to arrest and detain any person found in the UnitedKingdom in contravention of a deportation order.(4) Penalties for contravention of deportation orders.19. It may be considered that the balance of advantage lies against theinclusion of any of the following additional provisions:  -(a) Power to deport persons who are culpably dependent on public funds, otherthan those recommended on conviction under section 51 of the national assistance Act.ib) Power to deport persons whose deportation appears to the Secretary of state to be necessary for security reasons or otherwise conducive to the publicgood.(c) Provision for independent review of cases under (a) or ib).(d) Amendment of the registration provisions of the British Nationality Act,1948.(e) Powers to immigration officers to refuse leave to land to persons against whom deportation orders are in force and for this purpose to examineBritish subjects entering the country..15th October, 1958.

Appendix BCOLONIAL DEPORTATION LAWSIn 1934 the Secretary of State for the Colonies commended to all colonial territories a model ordinance which was based on the findings of a DepartmentalCommittee set up to report on the conditions which should govern the deportation of British subjects from colonies not possessing responsible government.2. The general lines of the ordinance have been followed in many colonial territories including Jamaica, Trinidad, British Honduras, the Windward Islands,Singapore, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Cyprus, Mauritius and Nigeria.Grounds for Deportation3.   In general, a deportation order may be made against a person who:  (1) has been convicted by a court of any offence punishable withimprisonment otherwise than imprisonment imposed for non-paymentof a fine and has been recommended by the court for deportation;(2) has been conducting himself so as to be dangerous to peace, good order,good government or public morals;(3) is, or is likely to be, a charge on public funds by reason of mental orbodily health or insufficiency of means to support himself and his dependants; or(4) has entered the territory contrary to the provisions of an ImmigrationOrdinance, but has not thereby committed an offence under thatOrdinance.Exemption from Deportation4.  An order may not be made against a British subject who (a) was born in the territory, or of parents who at the time of his birth wereordinarily resident there; or(b) has been ordinarily resident in the territory continuously for a period of  years or more and has not since the end of that period been ordinarily resident continuously for a period of seven years or more in any other part of the Commonwealth; or(c) was naturalised in the territory; or(d) is the wife or minor child of a person falling within the foregoing classes.Procedure5. When the Governor-in-Council wishes to make an order, he serves a notice on the person charged, specifying the fact laid against him and the grounds on which it is proposed to proceed, and requiring him to show cause before a judge why an order should not be made. The Judge hears the case and reports to the Governor, setting out his findings of fact and his conclusions on any questionof law involved. If he thinks fit, the Judge may also make a recommendation onthe decision to be taken. The final decision rests with the Governor-in-Council;and the judicial process which takes place before the decision is reached is not inany sense an appeal.6. In those territories which have followed the model ordinance an order may not be made against any but comparatively recent arrivals without the consentof the Secretary of State.
Territories in which the Ordinance has not been Adopted7. In the Leeward Islands the Governor may expel British subjects whohave been convicted of sedition or riot, or whose expulsion is in the interests ofpeace and good order. Orders may not be applied to British subjects domiciledin the territory or who have been resident there for 12 months. There is a rightof appeal to the Supreme Court, whose decision is final.8. In Barbados and British Guiana the Governor may deport an&quot; undesirable &quot; person if it appears to him expedient for the preservation of thepeace and good order of the Colony; but this does not apply to a British subjectwho is domiciled in or who has been ordinarily resident in the territories for twoyears.9. In Malta, the only power to deport a British subject lies in the authorityof a magistrate who, on application by an Immigration Officer, and on certain conditions, may make an order that a prohibited immigrant be removed from the island.
