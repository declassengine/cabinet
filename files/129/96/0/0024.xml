(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 24 COPY NO, V^-12th Febraary, 1959CABINETJOHN waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland on 8th May, 1958, Sir David Robertson, M.F. , wrote to me about a complaint by Mr. J.D. Waters of Thurso, concerning an alleged assault on Mr. Waters&apos; son, John, by two policemen on 7th December, 1957.   Asthe allegation concerned a criminal offence I sent the letter to the lord advocate.   I am informed by the Lord Advocate that this case had beeninquired into by the Procurator Fiscal who then reported it to the CrownOffice because police officers were involved.   On consideration of theProcurator Fiscal&apos;s report, Crown Counsel decided that criminal proceedings would not be justified, and the Fiscal was so informed.   on receipt of Sir David Robertson&apos;s representations the Lord Advocatepersonally reviewed the case and came to the same conclusion, and he so informed Sir David on 4th June, 1958.2.      Sir David Robertson then submitted to the Lord Advocate statementsfrcm a large number of witnesses and a statement by a doctor who had examined John Waters on the night of the alleged assault.   These were considered by the Lord Advocate, who after further inquiry by theProcurator Fiscal reached the same conclusion as before, and so informed sir David Robertson on 28th July, 1958.   Sir David continued to press theLord Advocate on the matter, and in answer to certain questions which hehad put, was informed that the information in the hands of the Crown wasconfidential and could not be disclosed.   He again raised the matter in a parliamentary Question addressed to the Lord Advocate on 25th November;and initiated an adjournment debate on 3rd February, 1959, in which theLord Advocate confirmed his decision not to take criminal proceedings and repeated his refusal to disclose the evidence in his possession, or thereasons for his decision.   Thereupon Sir David Robertson andMr. Denis Howell addressed Questions to me on 10th February asking foran inquiry into all the circumstances of the case.   After consulting theLord Advocate I took the view that, as the matter had already been fully investigated by him, there was no ground for a further inquiry.   Thefollowing Motion was then put down:-&quot;That this House calls upon the Government to set up a select Committee of this House to inquire into the case ofJohn Waters and to advise this House whether the saidJohn Waters was assaulted by certain police officers asalleged, and in what circumstances it was decided that noprosecution should be instituted. &quot;
3.      The disciplinary authority for the police in Scotland is the chief constable, not a committee of the local authority as in England and Wales.There is an appeal to me from his decision in all but minor disciplinarycases;   but I have no power myself to initiate disciplinary proceedings.4,     A police officer who is convicted of a criminal offence isautomatically liable to disciplinary proceedings;  but chief constables havebeen advised by my Department that where a criminal offence has beenalleged, and either the criminal authorities have decided against proceedingsor the officer has been acquitted, they should not bring a disciplinarycharge unless some separate disciplinary offence has been committed.5.      It would in theory be open to the complainers, with the leave of theLord Advocate or the couri, to initiate a private prosecution:  this has notbeen asked for.   Sir David Robertson referred in the adjournment debateto the possibility of the parents&apos; bringing a civil action against theofficers concerned, and it would, of course, be perfectly possible for themto do so;   but it seems clear that they will not do so as long as there is any chance of forcing a public inquiry.6.      I am satisfied that any inquiry either by a Select Committee of theHouse or under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, would be inappropriate in a case of this kind, and would, moreover, be bound to callinto question the decision taken by the Lord Advocate.7.      1 have carefully considered whether it would be advisable for me toappoint an independent person to inquire into the allegations made withregard to the conduct of the police officers concerned in this case.   I haveno statutory power to order such an inquiry, and the person holding it wouldnot be able to take evidence on oath or require the presence of witnesses.There are, however, even stronger objections to the holding of such an inquiry.   Whatever the terms of reference were, the inquiry would in essence be directed to the question of whether or not the boy was soassaulted as alleged.   This would form a dangerous precedent which,whatever the result of the inquiry, would have serious repercussions onthe administration of criminal justice throughout Great Britain.8,      In the circumstances I feel that the best course would be tore-emphasise the full consideration which has been given to the case by the criminal authorities, and to point out that it is within the power of thecomplainers, by bringing a civil action for damages, to secure a full andpublic inquiry in open court.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S.W.1.11th February, 1959-2-
