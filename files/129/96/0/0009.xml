(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 920th January, 1959COPY N&quot;CABINETROYAL FLIGHTS: ROYAL AIR FORCE ESCORTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for air the arrangements for sea and air escorts for Royal flightswere last reviewed in 1954 when the Cabinet endorsed a proposal that naval escorts should be provided only for flights by the Sovereign andwere informed that the air escort would continue (C.C.(54) 74th conclusions minute 4).   In reaching this decision the Cabinet took into account thatthe provision of a naval escort involved disturbance to fleet operations and was unlikely to provide effective help if the need arose.2.      The present position about air escorts is that when the Queen,the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret or theRoyal children fly considerable distances outside the United Kingdom,the Royal Air Force provides an escort aircraft within one hour&apos;s flyingtime of the Royal aircraft in areas where the United Kingdom hasresponsibility for sea/air rescue.   These aircraft are additional to thenormal rescue facilities.   In other areas, the Governments concerned are asked to arrange for escorts.   Captains of Royal aircraft are given notice of the position of merchant ships along their route.3.      Escort aircraft must be able to conduct a search at long range,drop rescue gear and guide ships and aircraft to the scene of an incident.Shackleton aircraft of the Royal Aii Force&apos;s maritime squadrons aretherefore the most suitable aircraft for this task.   Royal flights aretending to increase in number and length.   Royal aircraft may now flythree times as fast as the Shackleton.    This means that substantially more escort aircraft are required to cover a given distance.   At thesame time, the number of maritime aircraft in the Royal Air force has been reduced and the chances of a Royal aircraft having to alightat sea are now very slight.    It is also true to say that communications between ground and the Royal aircraft are much improved.4.      After discussion with the Minister of Transport and CivilAviation and the First Lord of the Admiralty, I have concluded that theprovision of escort aircraft as a general rule does not add significantlyto the safety of Royal flights.   Bearing in mind also the considerablestrain on resources which the provision of air escorts now involves,I believe a more selective approach is justified.-1-
si5.      I propose, therefore, that the Royal Air Force should continueto provide air escorts for Royal flights by the Sovereign and the Heirto the Throne.   The precise details of the air escort would be decidedfor each flight according to the circumstances.   For other Royal flightsair escorts would not normally be provided.   But if it is essential toroute such flights over an area where the normal search and rescuefacilities are inadequate, I would propose to examine specially theprovision of additional facilities in conjunction, as necessary, with theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation.6. I recommend that Her Majesty^ pleasure should be taken on theproposals in paragraph 5 above.G.W.Air Ministry, S.W.1.20th January, 19592-
