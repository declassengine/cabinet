  CONFIDENTIAL.5    Q(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 3417th February, 1959CABINETBROADCASTING DEVELOPMENTSMemorandum by the Postmaster-general on 29th July, 1958, the Cabinet agreed to defer the appointmentof an independent committee to enquire into the future of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) and the independent television Authority (I.T.A.) and other problems of broadcasting policy(C.C.(58) 65th Conclusions, Minute l).    Since then the Home AffairsCommittee invited me to ascertain the reaction of the E.B.C, and theI.T,A. to an independent enquiry.2.      This I have done.    Both the B.3.C. and the I.T.A. support theidea of an enquiry and say the sooner the better.3.      Here are the problems which face us:-(a) Additional television programmes.    On 22nd February, 1956,the then Postmaster-General announced that the Government had decidedto defer consideration for two years.   Now three years have elapsed.(b) Extended television hours.   It is publicly known that the I.T.A,applied for these in June, 1958.   The Home Affairs Committee decidedto refuse extra hours because the B.B.C. would not be able to use them without extra money from the Exchequer.    But they decided to dfeferthe announcement.(c) Long-standing applications from film and other interests for permission to start subscription television.(d) The increasing profits of programme contractors and the growing financial difficulties of the B.B.C.(e) The technical standards of line and colour.   The TelevisionAdvisory Committee is about to report.   Its recommendations have beenforeshadowed in the Press.   These technical issues cannot be dissociatedfrom the question of additional programmes.(f) Agitation about how the I.T A. are interpreting the Television Act.Advertising practices, methods of appointment of Programme contractors and the Authority&apos;s relations with them have all come under criticism.(g) Welsh and Scottish pressure for television services more nationalin character.   On the former the Minister for Welsh Affairs and myselfhave already met deputations.-1-COPY NO. \ /
QCONFIDENTIAL 1424.      All these problems really raise the future of the B.B.C. andthe 1/T.Aju Any answer will bring us more political debit than credit.The disappointed vested interests will see to that. Also if we continueto stall we shall be in trouble.   Setting up a Committee would be a positive demonstration of action - and the only one which would notland us in immediate difficulty.5.      For the-following reasons it is becoming increasingly difficultto stall.(l) Lord Boothby has a Mai ion down in the House of Lords.(2) Mr. Mayhew is to introduce a Private Member *s&quot; Billon 13th March to amend the Television Act.. (3) Sir John Barlow has a Question down and intends topress for an independent enquiry.(4) The B.3.C. want more money to run their present services.6.      Perhaps the Cabinet will say whether they agree that circumstances now favour an Independent Committee.   It has theadvantage that this Government would decide the terms of reference and choose the members.If they agree, two points remain.(i) There is the problem of finance for the E.B.C. untilthe Committee report.    The B.B.C. claim that they have not enoughmoney to run their present services.   They say that they- ought notto be at a disadvantage in comparison with Independent Television duringthe Committee&apos;s review.(ii) The B.B.C, Licence and Charter ends in June, 1962.   should we now extend it two years to July, 1964 (when the Television Act ends)or should it&apos;-be left for re-examination when the Committee has reported?E.M.General Post Office, E.C.1.17th February,1959-2-
