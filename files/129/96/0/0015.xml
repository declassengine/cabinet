confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1959C. (59) 15 Copy No.    g 330th January, 1959CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPresent SituationIn accordance with the Cabinefs decision on 11th September (C.C. (58)71st Conclusions, Minute 7) our Delegation at New York during the recent meetingof the United Nations General Assembly pressed for a Resolution convening afurther Conference of Plenipotentiaries at Geneva to consider the outstandingproblems of the breadth of the territorial sea and fishing limits; and such aResolution was in due course adopted by the Assembly.2. As we hoped, the Resolution did not provide that fishing problems shouldbe dealt with separately on a regional basis. It remains nevertheless an importantaspect of our own policy to seek the earliest possible accommodation in the North-East Atlantic with Iceland, the Faroes and Norway; partly for its own sake andpartly because of its value as assisting towards an eventual stabilisation of thewhole matter on a world-wide basis.3. Contrary to our wishes, the atmosphere in the United Nations did not favour the passage of a recommendation that, pending the convocation of the nextconference, all Governments should abstain from unilateral claims to extend theirterritorial or fishing limits. We and the Americans did secure a general understanding with the opposition led by Mexico that Governments should do nothing to &quot; prejudice the success of the Conference.&quot; But Iraq and Panama havealready passed laws (and the Governments of Libya and Iran have introducedBills) claiming a twelve-mile territorial sea despite British and American protests.We are now trying to obtain pledges that these laws will be reviewed in the lightof the next international conference.4. Unfortunately we were compelled to agree that the Conference shouldbe held in March-April 1960 instead of the summer of 1959. Had we not done so,the probability is that the whole matter would have been adjourned to the Assemblyof 1959, with the further danger that instead of any decision to convene aConference being then taken, the substantive issues would have been considered and decided on in the highly political and emotional atmosphere of the Assemblyitself.5. It is clear that we must undertake difficult and protracted negotiationsif we are to secure at the 1960 Conference both the six-mile territorial sea whichis considered to be the maximum compatible with our defence needs and thepreservation, outside the six-mile limit, of the historic fishing rights which are sonecessary to the prosperity of our fishing industry. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree upon the broad policy to be adopted and the immediate negotiations with should be undertaken.6. The following proposals have been made following interdepartmentalconsultation by officials and after full discussion with a team of United states officials who came to London in December. Their joint Conclusions were acceptedby the Chiefs of Staff on 8th January.54678
Provisional Policy7. I ask my colleagues first to agree with the officials&apos; assessment of thegeneral position. Briefly, it is that there is a dangerous tendency towardsinternational acceptance of a twelve-mile territorial sea to cover both defence and fishing claims. We cannot be content merely to block this move and let theConference fail, lest a general twelve-mile limit becomes established by custom.The United Kingdom however has no room for manoeuvre on defence requirements (because we cannot hope to secure less than a six-mile territorial sea and cannot afford to agree to a wider limit), and we have little room for manoeuvreon fisheries because, here, we shall be bound to concede that some kind of fisheryjurisdiction may extend to twelve miles but we shall suffer severely unless ourhistoric fishing rights in this area are substantially preserved. Therefore our only hope of success lies in the possibility that if we agree, as a &quot; package,&quot; to a six-mile territory sea and some tolerable limitation of fishing rights in a further six-milezone of the high seas, this will be recognised by a sufficient number of our opponentsas preferable to the chaos which would result from a breakdown of the 1960Conference.8. Secondly, I suggest we accept the officials&apos; recommendation that in order not to detract from our &quot; package &quot; offer, we should avoid reviving a seriousclaim to a three-mile territorial sea; and that, since we have no hope of securinginnocent passage rights for State aircraft at the proposed Conference, we should avoid raising this question, even in respect of international straits. The Chiefs ofStaff agree, though they maintain their view that the extension of the territorial sea to six miles will have military disadvantages and they emphasise the officials&apos;recommendation that we should nevertheless prepare to continue flying military aircraft over such straits, in order to begin building up new prescriptive rights,after the adoption of a six-mile territorial sea.9. Thirdly I ask my colleagues to agree with the recommendations of the officials regarding the negotiable fishery part of our package proposal. Briefly,they consider that:  (a) we could not hope to secure the agreement of the Conference to &quot;6 + 6subject to full historic rights,&quot; i.e., six miles of territorial sea and afurther six-mile zone in which countries with established fisheries there(but not newcomers) could exercise their historic rights withoutlimitation;(b) we should seek instead, in preparatory negotiations, to commit a two-thirds majority of States to &quot;6 + 6 subject to limited historic rights,&quot; i.e., a formula which would allow the exercise of historic rights in the outersix miles but only so that the amount of fishing did not exceed recentlevels;(c) any concession beyond this, such as 6 + 6 subject to the phasing-out of historic rights over a period (&quot; 6 + phased-out 6 &quot;), would be likely tocome so near in practice to 6 + plain 6 which in fishery terms isindistinguishable from a general twelve-mile limit that we should notentertain it in preparatory negotiations.The recommendations of officials as to the best way of formulating &quot;6 + 6 subjectto limited historic rights &quot; are tentative, since it is only in the course of preparatorynegotiations that the most acceptable version can be worked out.10. A number of States might be induced to support a general formulation ofthe fishery part of the &quot; package &quot; in terms more acceptable to us if provision were also made for States in certain special situations to enjoy preferential fishing rights.The First Geneva Conference adopted a resolution calling for such measures in twotypes of case: overwhelming dependence upon coastal fisheries for livelihood or economic development, and primary dependence on coastal fisheries for animalprotein diet, obtained by local small-boat fishing. Binding provisions to benefiteither or both these classes, however, would have their dangers for us; for example the preferential rights would exist in areas of the high seas outside as well as insideany twelve-mile limit. Accordingly, the decision whether one or more formulaeapplicable to special fishery situations should be added to the &quot; package &quot; can onlybe taken in the light of the preparatory negotiations.
Preparatory Negotiations11. It is evident that in order to make a success of this policy we must set aboutgaining support for our solution quickly and quietly. Quickly, in order to counteract the trend towards a general twelve-mile limit and also to be ready for any surprisemoves in the 1959 General Assembly; and quietly in order to avoid either setting offa defensive chain of claims to twelve miles or alternatively creating the impression that we and the other fishing States would make indefinite concessions to the coastalStates.12. As seen at present our best course appears to be to continue our efforts toobtain the support of conservative European fishing States which might otherwise be reluctant to vote for concessions which we would accept. Further, we must make every effort to win over the Canadians, and a first round of official talks with them has been arranged in Ottawa for the beginning of February. A Ministerial approachmay later be necessary. The Canadians were the advocates of &quot; 6-f plain 6 &quot; at the1958 Geneva Conference and they are now believed to favour &quot; 6 + phased-out 6 &quot;as a compromise. An early indication of Canadian readiness to contemplate &quot; 6 + 6subject to limited historic rights &quot; as a solution would facilitate the approaches wemust make to the other key States such as India.13. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to preparatory negotiations, aiming at a &quot; 6 + 6 subject to limited historic rights &quot; solution, on the understanding thatthere would be the closest United Kingdom /United States collaboration betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States throughout. After consultations withkey States, which would be confidential and would not commit Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment at this stage, United Kingdom and United States officials would review the policy outlined in the present paper and I should make a further report to theCabinet.S.
