(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) u COPY NO.26th January, 1959CABINETK.L.M. SERVICES TO SINGAPOREMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsThe problemThis concerns the number of services per week which weshould allow Royal Dutch Airlines (K.JL.M.) to operate between theNetherlands and Singapore.   More specifically, the question is whether -(a) we should cut the weekly number from two to one asfrom the end of February, 1959, (as we have told theDutch we wish to do);   or(b) to let the second service run till the beginning of november and review the future position in the light of the trafficfigures (as the Dutch have now proposed);   or(c) we should suggest some compromise.background. Until the Indonesian crisis in late 1957 K.L.M. operated three services a week to Indonesia through Singapore, and two other servicesthrough other points.   To help them over the difficulties created bytheir exclusion from Indonesia, we agreed that all five services couldtemporarily terminate at Singapore.   Till then K.L..M. had no rights to terminate there.   When traffic resulting from the Dutch evacuation from Indonesia fell off, the number of terminating services was reduced in February, 1958, to three, with Dutch agreement.   In March, 1958,we told them that the service should be reduced to one per week inaccordance with the normal principles governing the grant of suchtraffic rights.   The Dutch protested at this decision, and following ameeting with Dr. Buns,  the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, inJune, it was decided that the number of services should be reduced to two from July, 1958, and that the question of a further reduction shouldbe reviewed.   After exhaustive discussions with the Dutch at official level, Ministers decided in December last that the cut to one servicemust take effect on 31st January, 1959.   The Dutch took this decisionvery badly and there was widespread adverse publicity in theNetherlands;   (any matter which touches on the fortunes of the-1-CONF1DENT1AL
Netherlands national airline and Dutch post-war difficulties inIndonesia is apt to be explosive).   Dr. Luns indicated that he wishedto discuss this question again during his visit to London in January,1959, and it was therefore decided to defer giving effect to the cutuntil 28th February, 1959.3. It should be noted that on the normal basis on which civilaviation negotiations are conducted, we were under no obligation tooffer even one terminating service to K.L.M. at Singapore, except inreturn for the concession to United Kingdom airlines of a correspond-ing benefit within the gift of the Dutch Government.   The Dutch werenot in a position to offer this, and, indeed the balance of advantage in our civil aviation relations with the Netherlands is heavily on theDutch side (e.g. transatlantic rights through points in the UnitedKingdom).   Though this basis of operations may seem restrictive,it is the basis on which all countries conduct their civil aviationdealings.   It also provides a means of protecting the British overseas airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) in its present financial difficulties.The offer of one frequency at Singapore was, by these standards,reasonable and even generous.The latest Dutch proposal4. At the discussion on 26th January Dr. Luns handed over an aide-memoire and a memorandum (Annexes A and B) proposing, ineffect, that K.L.M. should continue to operate two weekly services to singapore (one to be termed &quot;regular&quot; and the other &quot;special&quot;) for atrial period until, say, 1st November.   A further decision would thenbe taken in the light of the commercial factors.   In explaining thisproposal, Dr. Luns said that at that review political considerations would not come in question.5. I do not think that we should accept this proposal as it stands because:-(a) Any political advantage we gained from accepting it wouldbe short-lived.   We could not hope, in spite of what Dr. Luns has said, to divorce this issue from political considerations, and when theproposed further review took place, we should face another storm.(b) The Dutch have produced no fresh arguments apart from political ones which would justify our accepting their proposal.(c) If we were to accept the Dutch proposal, the fact that wehad done so for primarily political reasons would soon be known, andother countries would be quick to draw the lesson that we are preparedto give way in civil aviation commercial negotiations, providedsufficient political pressure is applied.   This would not only weaken our position in such discussions, but also would have the effect of transferring them to the political plane.-2-
Alternative courses6. If we cannot accept the Dutch proposal, the question arises whether any counter offer could be made which would not seriouslyharm our interests but which would help to improve our relations withthe Dutch and save Dr. Duns1 face.   The following possibilities exist,in ascending order of probable attractiveness from the Dutch point ofview:-(a) To maintain our decision, but to propose thatin, say, sixmonths we should jointly review with the Dutch our whole civilaviation relationship with them.   The difficulty about this is that theDutch experts would realise that they would in fact stand to lose ratherthan gain from such a review.   Another difficulty is that Dutch publicopinion might come to believe that at such a review K.L.M. could expectfurther concessions from us, in Singapore and elsewhere, and the finalupshot might be even more damaging in the long run to our relationswith the Netherlands.   We could, however, guard against this dangerby warning Dr. Luns that he must not expect that at this review wewould come bearing gifts.   The offer of a review is one which theDutch could scarcely decline, and it would be better from Dr. Duns&apos;point of view than a straight refusal.(b) To naaintain our decision, but take the Dutch up on their offer to review this question again on the basis of traffic statistics,but to do so immediately on the basis of the last six months and noton the period ending 1st November this year (as they have proposed).The difficulty here is that there is no reason to suppose that such discussions would be any more fruitful than those held with the Dutchlast October.   Our view is that the statistical results would not differ from the present ones and that this argument would inevitably come up against the same political considerations.   There is in any case no material difference between us and the Dutch on the statistical evidence.The difference lies in their application to the number of services theyjustify.(c) We could offer to extend the second K.L.M. service for afurther month beyond the end of February.   Before the end of Marchwe would take a final decision after a further discussion with the Dutchof the statistical evidence.   This offer would be made on the under-standing that the Dutch would accept any final decision with good graceand without press campaigning.   This seems the most promisingpossibility from the point of view of our relations with the Dutch, andI believe that Dr. Luns would regard it as helpful to him politically.Though it is open to some objection on the ground of the precedent whichit would create, it would not be very damaging to B.O.A.C.ls commercial interests.7. If my colleagues agree, I would propose to adopt the courseoutlined in paragraph 6(c) above and to inform the Netherlands Govern-ment as soon as possible.   In that case, the review of the statisticalevidence would have to be held early next month.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.2 8th January, 1959 -3-
ANNEX AAIDE-MEMOIREPresented by Dr. Luns, Foreign Ministerof the NetherlandsIn connection with the British Governments decision as aresult of which K.L..M. Royal Dutch Airlines will have to reduce the frequency of their Amsterdam-Singapore flights to once a week, it is deemed appropriate to draw attention to the following facts.1. K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines have, to the best of their ability,tried to observe the cabotage rules as interpreted by the british authorities.   Only 15 (i. e. 1 per cent) of the 1,474 passengers bookedfor flights to Europe by K.L.M, at Singapore during the period July-31st December, 1958, were bound for the United Kingdom;these 15 passengers had either paid the total amount of the sectionalfares, or they had arranged for very complicated trips with severalstop-overs, in which case K.L.M. provided transport on part of the route only and/or one or more stops were involved not served byB.O.A.C.2. The facts and figures put forward by K.L.M. Royal DutchAirlines which, in the opinion of the Netherlands authorities, justify a frequency of two flights a week on the Amsterdam-Singapore route,have never been commented upon by the British authorities, who havenot submitted a detailed evaluation stating to what extent these facts and figures are or are not acceptable to them.3. In this connection attention may be drawn to the fact that alllanding rights on Netherlands territory requested on behalf of british air companies in the course of the years (e. g. at Rotterdam) were always promptly granted in contrast to the landing rights on british territory requested by the Netherlands Government during that periodon behalf of K.L..M.4. Finally the British interpretation of the &quot;Bermuda CapacityClauses&quot; may be recalled as set forth by the Deputy Secretary of CivilAviation, Mr. A.H. Wilson, in his letter of 7th May, 1958, to theNetherlands Director-General of Civil Aviation, Mr. J.W.F. Backer, inconnection with the problem of a multilateral agreement for regularservices in Europe.   In this letter it is said among other things:-&quot;We feel that it might be possible to progress towards a multilateral agreement with Bermuda type capacity control if this typeof control was more fully understood and if it was underlined that its essential feature is that it leaves the airlines free in the first instance to provide the capacity they consider necessary according to their commercial judgment while retaining for Governments the right to review this capacity in the light of practical experience of its operation.-1-
Also in the light of the above-mentioned points, effortsmight still be made to arrive at a constructive solution acceptable to both parties.Such a solution might, for instance, be sought in permittingK.L.M. to operate - in addition to one regular weekly flight on the route Amsterdam-Singapore v. v. - one special flight a week during a trial period of forty weeks until, for instance, 1st November of thisyear.After the termination of this trial period a further decision might be taken by an ex post facto review on the basis of the trafficresults achieved during that period.London.26th January, 1959ANNEX BMemorandum by Dr. Luns, Foreign Ministerof the NetherlandsThe message of the Acting Foreign Secretary,Mr. Macmillan, which was handed to me on 10th January, 1959, to theeffect that as from 3lst January, 1959, (in the meantime extended to28th February, 1959), K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines flights to Singaporewill be reduced to only one a week has greatly shocked theNetherlands Government and people.2. My immediate reply to the British Ambassador atThe Hague on 10th January, followed by the Netherlands Ambassador&apos;scall on Sir Frederick Koyer Millar and the reactions in the entireNetherlands press clearly testify to this.3. In the note submitted on behalf of the Netherlands Govern-ment to the Foreign Office on 5th September, 1958, by the NetherlandsCharge d&apos;Affaires in London, the Netherlands Government set forth the civil aviation and general political considerations underlying theirconviction that K.L.M. are entitled to a frequency of at least twoflights a week to Singapore.4. During the subsequent negotiations a detailed explanation of the Netherlands standpoint was given both in writing and orally,also in a number of personal discussions between you and me.-2-
5. Among other things it was pointed out that K.JL.M.-, whichhave been pioneers in civil aviation in the Far East, opened a regularair service between Amsterdam and Batavia in 1930.   In 1933Singapore was included in this service and ever since 1937 K.L.M. havestopped in transit at Singapore three times a week on this route,except during the Second World War.6. &quot;When at the end of 1957 Jakarta could no longer be used byK.L.M. as a terminal as a result of the political developments inIndonesia the British Government granted K.L.M. temporary airterminal rights at Singapore, for the time being for five flights a week,for which the Netherlands Government have been duly grateful.7. The latest British decision will cut K.L.M. flights to singapore to one flight a week, after their number had already beenreduced to twice a week.8. In the light of the enormous expansion of internationalaviation in the course of the twenty-two years which have passed since1937, the reduction, in 1959, of the number of K.L.M. flights to singapore to one a week can only be regarded as an attempt to make acommercial operation impossible.9. The Netherlands Government are of the opinion that theBritish Government have not taken due account of the facts and figuresput forward by the Netherlands Government during the repeateddiscussions, facts and figures which were not contradicted by theBritish Government and which fully justify a frequency of two flights aweek on the route in question.   In this connection the netherlands government must draw attention to the fact that the British Governmenthave never challenged the Netherlands view that the operation of oneweekly service to Singapore is not a commercial proposition forK.L.M., all the more so in view of the present services of other aircarriers operating to and via Singapore.10. For that reason the British decision which purports to grant a right not existing previously amounts in practice to giving K.JL.M. the choice of either operating an air service at a loss or abandoning itsflights to Singapore altogether.11. The Netherlands Government deem such an alternative to be unfair.12. Irrespective of the aviation considerations, it has been statedmore than once on the British side that any decision in this matter wouldlikewise take into account the political arguments put forward by theNetherlands Government.13. In Mr. MacmillanTs message it says, however, &quot;that thereis no overriding case for K.L.M. continuing to operate more than oneterminal service at Singapore on the basis of civil aviation considera-tions&quot;.-3
14. The Netherlands Government must - as has been outlined above - take strong exception to this view and must conclude fromMr. Macmillan&apos;s statement that their political arguments have notbeen taken into consideration.15. The Netherlands Government deplore the fact that theBritish attitude once more shows a lack of understanding of theNetherlands arguments.   As the British Government are no doubtaware, the political developments in Indonesia have already causedmuch damage to the Netherlands.16. The Netherlands Government express their concern at theconsequences which the implementation of the British decision mighthave for the friendly co-operation between the two countries, which inmany fields is such a close one.17. With reference to the last sentence of Mr. Macmillan&apos;message, the Netherlands Government, after due consideration,believe that a mutually acceptable arrangement is still possible with-out affecting both points of view in principle.   Therefore theNetherlands Government coake an urgent appeal to the British Govern-ment to see their way to agree with a constructive proposal, draftedto this effect.London.26th January, 1959
