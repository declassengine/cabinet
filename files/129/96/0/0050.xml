Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1959C. (59) 50 Copy No.   8 012th March, 1959.cabinet internation DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues may remember that in the Exchange of Letters betweenPresident Eisenhower and Mr. Anderson, United States Secretary of the Treasury,about an increase in the resources of the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.)and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) whichwas published in August, 1958, the President referred to the desirability of settingup a new International Development Association (I.D.A.) as an affiliate of theI.B.R.D. The purpose of such an Association would be to finance development projects on the basis of long-term loans at reasonably low rates of interest repayablein whole or in part in local currencies. The President also made the suggestionthat such an Association might be able to use for productive investment the various local currencies available to the United States through the sale of agriculturalsurpluses or other aid programmes.2. At New Delhi and subsequently these ideas have been discussed withMr. Anderson informally on a number of occasions. There are three aspects ofthem in particular which cause us concern. In the first place we have specialcommitments towards Commonwealth countries which we cannot neglect and,whatever advantage the Americans might see in putting their aid to underdevelopedcountries through an international organisation, we could not use such a channelto fulfil more than a part of those commitments. Secondly, we are concerned lest the practice of giving &quot;soft&quot; loans on a large scale should destroy the debtor/creditor relationship which has been established with underdeveloped countries,and the normal market pattern of lending. Just as bad money drives out goodmoney, so could bad loans drive out good ones to the great disadvantage of lendersand borrowers alike. Thirdly, loans repayable in local currencies are disguisedgifts and, whatever presentational advantages such a disguise might have either forthe United States Congress or for recipient countries, the fact is that the funds ofI.DA. would need regular replenishment with freely transferable currencies, or it could not continue to function.3. Nevertheless, we must recognise the great problem which is presented bythe conditions in underdeveloped countries to-day. This problem is discussed ina memorandum which the Economic Adviser to the Government has prepared inconsultation with other Departments, and which is annexed. Capital is needed toincrease output, but low output makes the burden of saving for capital too heavy.To break this vicious circle requires either rigid dictatorship or the provision ofcapital from richer countries. Already the stage is approaching when someunderdeveloped countries will have exhausted their capacity for borrowing abroadat market rates of interest.   Some other solution is needed.4. We have now heard from the Economic Minister in Washington that while Mr. Anderson sympathises with the United Kingdom&apos;s hesitations he still thinksit is essential for the industrialised countries to come out with some new proposalsfor aid to underdeveloped countries on a multilateral basis. He would like to knowhow much we should be willing to contribute and would then work out his plans for an I.D.A. to fit our requirements. He emphasised that although he was determined to go ahead with his proposals his ideas were not grandiose.54887b
5. In view of the considerations advanced in the Economic Adviser&apos;s paper(annexed) I think we must adopt a more positive attitude towards I.D.A. than wehave done so far and that we should authorise our Economic Minister to continue his discussions with Mr. Anderson and to talk to Mr. Black (President of I.B.R.D.).Unless we take advantage of. the opening we now have there, is some danger ofI.D.A. starting off on the wrong footing and on too small a scale.6. I think that $2,000 millions in freely transferable currencies would.be asuitable figure for the initial capital of I.DA. To this sum we might offer a contribution of  100 millions ($280 millions). I should not expect the new I.DA,to be able to spend $2,000 millions in less than three to five years from the date ofits establishment, which could not be until, say, some time in 1960, so that our contribution would be an expenditure of  20- 30 millions a year. We should haveto look on this as an addition to our present level of overseas investment, butjudging from our experience of I.B.R.D.&apos;s operations we could expect a substantialportion of the total capital of the Fund to be invested in the Commonwealth.Moreover, we could expect to secure our proper share of the increased exports tounderdeveloped countries which would be financed by I.DA. I believe we should try to carry this additional burden. What happens when the initial capital hasbeen spent would have to be considered afresh on its merits.7. We need not take a decision on amounts now. But we do need to decide in principle that we would be willing to contribute. I accordingly invite mycolleagues to take this decision and to agree that I should authorise the EconomicMinister in Washington to discuss this matter further with Mr. Anderson andMr. Black.8. It is important that the full amount of the United Kingdom&apos;s contributionto the development of underdeveloped countries should be continually broughtto the notice of the public at home and abroad and that this new contribution whenit becomes effective should be included in the total which might well be expressed as a percentage of national income.9. This matter of aid for the underdeveloped countries may be raised at thediscussions this month between the Prime Minister and President Eisenhower.Indeed, it is for consideration whether the Prime Minister should not himself initiatediscussion.10.   To sum up, I ask my colleagues to agree that (a) We should be prepared in principle to contribute to an international development Association on the scale indicated in paragraph 6 above.(b) I should authorise the Economic Minister in Washington against this background to continue his discussions with Mr. Anderson and withMr. Black but not at this stage to disclose the amount Of any contribution which the United Kingdom might be prepared to make.I would further like to suggest that the Prime Minister might consider, if theopportunity arises, expressing to President Eisenhower our continuing concernover the problem of development in the backward countries and our readiness toplay our part in international solutions.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,12 th March, 1959.
&apos;-.   ANNEX/&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;*AID FOR UNDER-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES&quot; The free world isn&apos;t going to defend itself by rockets and bombers, howevergood they are. It is going to defend itself because when tested, people say &apos; that&apos;s abetter way of living it gives the individual a fuller life it gives him the kind of thing he wants.&apos; So if you&apos;re going to have, say, world unemployment, deeprecessions, you can have all the rockets in the world. You won&apos;t defend yourselfagainst Communism or Left-wing propaganda. You&apos;11 defend yourself if you canprove that this is the best way of living.&quot; (The Prime Minister, C.B.S. interview with Mr. Ed. Murrow, 23rd May, 1958.)2. Although the Prime Minister, in the passage quoted, was speakingprimarily of general economic, conditions in the free world, everything he said canbe applied with equal force to the under-developed countries. This is already oneof the great world problems of our time and it seems certain that it will become more acute as the Cold War goes on. We shall be struggling for the support or atleast the neutrality of the backward countries and will have to show them that inthe West lies their best hope for development. Economic aid, in a very real sense,must be regarded as a part of defence expenditure. It is the realisation of thiswhich has led to the strength of the support in the United States for the foreign aid programme generally.3. The essence of the problem is that countries with very low living standardscannot continue as free societies and at the same time save enough to develop their resources fast enough to give them a reasonable prospect of any marked improvement in their economic position. It is a vicious circle, where capital is needed to increase output but low output makes the burden of saving for capitaltoo heavy. To break the circle requires either rigid dictatorship, to enforce the hardships involved, or the provision of capital from richer countries.4. We have seen a rapid spread of dictatorial government over the last year or so; and the developing. willingness of the Communist bloc themselves to offercapital assistance, which itself strengthens that tendency. The West now needsrather urgently to make up its mind whether it is willing to counter this trend. if our general strategy is to give as little ground as possible, then clearly we must takeeconomic assistance seriously.5. But the West cannot hope to prevail simply by trying to outbid the East in development expenditure. The Communist bloc at present enjoys psychologicaladvantages over the West, and the technical achievements of the Soviet Union andthe increase in production being brought about by the Communes in China attract the (sometimes exaggerated) admiration of the newly developing countries and setthem standards to emulate or imitate. To counter this, the West must show thatit is taking development seriously, is interested in it for its own sake, and is readyto devote an international organisation to the business of furthering, co-ordinatingand financing the work of development. The West, unlike the East, can point toa second stream, of private investment, which will begin to flow and deepen as the initial v/ork of inter-governmental investment begins to show results.6. It is not likely that the amounts needed will be intolerably burdensomefor the richer countries; though we must recognise that assistance will need tocontinue to flow for a considerable period the problem is not one of short-termrescue operations. Nor is it probable that the aid will be lost in a bottomless pit,as is sometimes suggested. All the rich countries were once under-developed, andfew of the backward countries are so badly placed for national resources that capitalwill not help them to develop. The major difficulties appear to be to get stable and efficient Governments (one corollary of which is that capital assistance needs tobe accompanied by technical assistance and probably supervision), rational systems of land-tenure, and some check to the rapid growth of population. It must beadmitted that the population problem is far from solved. But a growth in wealthis more likely to aid in its solution than to hinder, and in any ease we cannot afford to make it an excuse for neglecting development problems.54887
4 SECRET ?:7. At present the free world though it is doing a great deal in the aggregate,deals with the problem in a somewhat unsystematic and disorganised way. TheUnited States provides a good deal of help but the programmes are on an annualbasis and the approach mainly ad hoc. The United Kingdom has so far not felt able to make any substantial contribution but makes grants to the Colonies and will shortly seek powers from Parliament to make Exchequer loans to supplement whatis available from the London Market. It has also begun to make Government-to-Government loans (through the Export Credits Guarantee Department mechanism)to independent Commonwealth Governments. (The run-down of sterling balances,e.g., by India, is a strain on United Kingdom resources but not regarded as help bythe owners of the balances.) Germany is just beginning to move. The United-Nations has technical assistance programmes. A large source of funds has beenthe I.B.R.D. which we expect to double its capital in 1959 and so open up thepossibility of adding substantially to its resources from the market. The I.B.R.D.makes loans after a careful study of the prospects of repayment, with political considerations in a very subordinate role. The main question here is whether loanswhich are made in this way are enough to meet the requirements, and also whetherthe burden of repayment will not grow too fast and be a check on further development. There is some flow of private capital, but in general under-developed countries are not an attractive place for such funds.8. The under-developed countries themselves have been pressing for sometime for a Special United Nations Fund (SUNFED) which would supplementexisting resources and make loans on an easier basis (i.e., more like grants) than  .B.R.D. The United States and the United Kingdom have so far been very luke-warm about this as it is thought that they would have to find most of the moneybut have little control over how it was spent.9. There are a number of weaknesses in the present arrangements. Basically,there has been a considerable presentational difficulty and a tendency for theRussians to get more credit for small amounts than the West does for larger ones.This may be connected with the American tendency to link at least their direct aidwith their own defence. However this may be, there can be no doubt that the waya programme is presented and the spirit in which it is administered are likely tobe as important as the actual help given. Any programme should be presented asdesigned to help poorer countries to improve their conditions because it is right that this should be done, and not because of political advantages (beyond thoseindicated in the quotation from the Prime Minister) which the West wants.10. On a more technical level, there seems to be three main weaknesses inthe present arrangements. These are first, lack of co-ordination, second, lack ofcontinuity, and third, uncertainty as to whether the amounts provided and theuse to be made of them, are adequate.11. One of the advantages of better co-ordination would be that we would bein a better position to know the scale of the problem than we do. As a tentativejudgment, however, it seems fairly certain that at least some of the countries concerned are not getting enough. I.B.R.D. loans, for example, are made on amore-or- less commercial basis. But the poorest countries which really need helpmost urgently, are the ones least likely to be able to repay their loans on commercialterms. Mr. Black, the President of the I.B.R.D., holds the view that there is needfor his loans to be supplemented by others, or by gifts, made on less stringentcriteria.12. On continuity, there is at present no guarantee that funds will continue until development has gone far enough to be self-sustaining, or even to coverprojects which take a number of years to finish. The Americans are very conscious of this weakness, which as far as their own direct aid is concerned arises from theneed for annual appropriations from Congress.13. There have been a number of indications from Washington in the lastyear that the Americans are increasingly worried about these matters and arereconsidering their attitude. They have not got very far with their thinking, and inparticular seem to hold fallacious views about the use of &quot; local currency &quot; balanceswhich they have already acquired, and which can make little if any contribution tothe real problem of development. But their general aim seems to be to get theirloans and grants on to a multilateral basis, associating other countries with the burdens and responsibilities involved.  In New Delhi they told us that they were
SECRET- Si-thinking about an International Development Association and recent exchangesbetween us have carried this idea a good deal further. They have suggested that we might send someone to Washington for.preliminary talks.14. Our own attitude so far has been rather a defensive one, mainly becauseof doubts as to whether we could afford to make any contribution, though we have recognised that there is a problem and that it is in our own interests that othercountries should lend for development purposes. [&apos;, /-15. We should now ask ourselves whether we ought not to be taking a more positive and constructive view about the whole subject. If we do not do so in thevery near future, the Americans will push on with their own scheme and on theviews taken in this note, we may well end up with something which is quite inadequate to the world situation.16.   On the arguments so far put forward, it appears that two things are needed.17. It is necessary to look at the problem of developmenf of backwardcountries as a whole and in a rather long-run context, and with a high prioritybased mainly on political considerations. This would require a policy directivefrom the highest levels. It would also require a great deal more systematic andco-ordinated work than has so far been done to form an idea of how muchassistance might be needed (in addition to what is already in sight) and how urgentthe existing problems are. In this connexion it should be noted that the Indianswill need further help in the very near future and that we are far from having an agreed view with the Americans as to what should be done or how we should see that the money provided is put to good use. Clearly it is very difficult to formsensible views on an individual problem of this kind, though it may well be the biggest single one, when we have not got the general picture.18. We do not want to confine aid to Government-to-Government grants.From the point of view of the West there are a number of objections (a) It makes for over-centralisation in Government hands of the economic structure in the developing country.(b) It makes for excessive dependence, which can easily harm rather than helprelations.  The aim must be to build up economic independence.19. Further private investment is already flowing on a large scale and notonly to the most prosperous countries. But the process will have to start in manycases on a direct or indirect Government-to-Government basis, though aiming fromthe first to pave the way for the independence of the economy of the recipientcountries.20. Nevertheless, the fact must be faced that the richer countries of the free world will probably have to provide more money for a period that cannot be exactlydefined in advance, and that some at least of these funds will have to be in a formon which an early return cannot be expected. If this is accepted, it raises problemsboth of the capacity of the West, and of the sort or organisation which will be needed.21. It is very difficult to know how much should be provided or what theUnited Kingdom should contribute. A number of studies have been made which gave figures varying between an additional $10,000 millions over the next five years,to the suggestion by the State Department that the proposed I.D.A. should start with a capital of $1,000 millions to be spent over several years. The latter figureseems certainly to be too small in relation to what we already know aboutrequirements. Probably the best course would be to begin with as much as couldbe raised, which would no doubt be nearer to $1,000 millions than to $10,000millions, while recognising that we would have to find additional amounts afterthe first capital was committed, before the countries concerned could beself-sustaining.22. The United Kingdom contribution would be a matter of negotiation. Atpresent we contribute 14 per cent, to the capital of the I.B.R.D. but this is muchmore than a proportional share if we take, for example, national income as a basisof contribution. 14 per cent, of $1,000 millions is about  50 millions and it seems clear that if we take the problem seriously we can afford more than this if it isspread over several years. We spend about  1,500 millions a year on defence. The
Labour Party has suggested that we should devote 1 per cent, of the national income (rather less than  200 millions a year) to help under-developed countries,but this would include what we are doing already on Colonial Development and welfare.23.   The cost to the economy needs to be considered under two heads:  (a) Our capacity to provide more goods without payment.(b) The likelihood that the provision of more sterling would lead, directly or indirectly, to a demand for more British goods, as opposed to a drain onthe reserves.24. On (a), the British economy is certainly working at well below capacity atpresent the index of industrial production is below the figure reached in 1955although we have had three years of high investment and Ministers are concerned about the level of unemployment. If we are ever to set aside some part of our future production for the purposes here envisaged, the present is clearly a very good time before domestic claims have been allowed to rise and absorb theavailable slack it is much harder to check a domestic use of resources to which one is already committed, than to allocate a potential but as yet uncommittedincrease.25. On (b), the United Kingdom can never be free from balance of paymentsanxieties. But if home capacity is adequate to produce additional exports, theproblem created by additional lending or gifts overseas depends on whether theseout payments result in additional exports. As a rough approximation, it can beassumed that we would get in this form something like our share of world trade.Similarly, if other countries make loans or gifts, we would expect to get the samesort of share. So long, therefore, as the share we contribute to the total fundsprovided for economic development is no more than proportionate to our share of world trade, the additional lending should not in itself create new balance ofpayments problems for us. For the whole operation would lead at least to theadditional exports needed. We would also have to ensure either that no loanswere tied to the products of the countries making them, or that our loans were atleast as much tied as those of other contributors. The general conditions for a balance of payments surplus, that our prices are competitive and that we do notoverload our resources, are with us whatever we do.26. The problems of organisation are extremely difficult and complex, sincewhat is here envisaged is some form of co-ordination of the whole work ofdevelopment, including the contributions already made by existing bodies. Itwould be very difficult to set up a new institution formally charged with suchco-ordination, since the United States would probably refuse to co-operate if done under United Nations auspices, and it could hardly be set up with any hope ofsuccess under those of any particular group of countries.^ 27. The only new body which is reeded is something on the lines of the I.D.A.which has been suggested by the Americans, but with provision for a regular supplyof new money from the richer countries and with the role of local currencies reducedto its proper dimensions. It would be necessary that such a body should be willingto make loans much less prospect of early repayment than the loans now madeby I.B.R.D. At the least, it would need to be controlled by those who makecontributions but it might be desirable to associate prospective recipients in someway, as is done in I.B.R.D. For many reasons it would need to have a strongpermanent staff, and to work in very close relation with the I.B.R.D.28. If such a body were established with the intention that it should fill thegaps in present Development plans, this would of course give it a co-ordinatingfunction since in arriving at its own contribution in any case it would have to assess what other sources of funds were available. There are a number of obviousdifficulties: for example, that of making sure that it did not help those who could have got help in other ways, and that of devising some form of lending or givingwhich was inherently &quot; soft&quot; or easy, without creating any further presumptionsin favour of default on other loans, a temptation to which backward countries are particularly prone.29. None of the difficulties should be regarded as insuperable if the main objective is thought to have sufficient importance, having regard to the worldsetting.   Experience suggests that an international organisation such as the
International Monetary Fund or the I.B.R.D. is able to deal with the awkwardquestions involved and that in the process it attracts much less odium than any individual country.30. But experience also suggests that any international operation of thiskind has the best hope of being successful only if two conditions are met. The first is that its objects and organisation should be inherently reasonable and sensiblefrom the beginning, and likely to fit in with widely-held views about worldproblems and requirements. This only means that reasonable and sensible men should think that what is being attempted is reasonable and sensible.31. The second is that the United Kingdom and the United States shouldbe acting with substantially similar views as to the purposes of the organisationand the ways in which particular problems should be handled. These two countries,when they are trying to achieve broadly similar objects and when these objects canbe defended in the light of general free world opinion, have an enormous powerof getting things done with the agreement and help of more or less like-mindedcountries; but if they are not in agreement this power is very much diminished.It is politically very undesirable for them to be seen to be concerting their views and imposing them on the rest of the world. But their influence, and the resourcesof skilled administrators which they command, are so great that they can nearlyalways get what they want in a continuing practical operation, as long as they see things broadly in the same way. Once this is secured, the practical difficulties inherent in an international organisation become generally manageable.32.   Conclusions(a) We must expect to have to discuss this question with the Americans in thenear future.(b) We ought to make up our mind as to whether we want a positiveinternational development policy or not.(c) If we do, we must be prepared to contribute.(d) We ought then to put our ideas privately to the Americans.(e) If the operation is to be successful, we need to work very closely, thoughinformally, with them.6th February, 1959.
