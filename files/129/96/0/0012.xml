Progress of theFive-Year Defence plan in April 1957, the Government announced to Parliament a five-year defence plan, designed to produce &quot; compact all regular forces of the highest quality, armed and organised on the most up-to-date lines.&quot; In the annual statement of the following year,certain further details were filled in.The developments of the past two years have not made it necessary to revise that plan. In fact, subsequent events haveshown it to have been conceived on sound and workable lines.Consequently, this present statement announces no changes,of policy, and is confined to reporting the progress of the planduring the first two years.Voluntary Recruitment1. The most important new feature of the policy announced in 1957was the proposal to end National Service in 1962 and to go over to smallerall-regular forces. In order to make that possible a considerable increasein the rate of voluntary recruitment was essential.. The Services weregiven authority to recruit up to the following ceilings: Navy 88.000;Army 165.000: R.A.F. 135.000.* The general trend of recruiting during thepast year has been most satisfactory. Subject to some shortages in certainSDecialised branches, there is every prospect that all three Services will attaintheir ceilings and could even exceed them if required.2. There never was doubt that the Naw would be able to recruit itsplanned strength, and this is being confirmed by experience. During 1958,the Royal Navy and Royal Marines recruited 8.250 ratings and other ranks.This rate is higher than is needed to attain their ceiling. Indeed, recruitingfor some branches has become competitive. As in the other Services theremay be some shortage of officers, particularly in the Instructor and Medicalbranches, but the numbers are small.3. Recruiting for the Army has been going well. The introduction ofthe minimum 6-year engagement has been fully justified by results. During1958, the Army recruited 29,000 men as compared with only 25,000 in 1957and the number recruited on engagements of 6 years or more rose from 4,900to 22,000. The intake of boys and apprentices, to which much importance is attached, rose during the year by 43%, as a result of which it has beendecided to open additional schools.4. The present rate of recruiting, if it continues, is sufficient to enablemost branches of the Army, including all the fighting arms, to reach theirauthorised establishments by the end of 1962, with a margin to spare.Recruiting for the medical, ordnance, pay and catering services has improved,* Adult U.K. males (all ranksl
but is still not fully up to requirements. Should there prove to be shortages,which is not yet certain, the numbers involved will be small and variousremedies are being considered.5. One of the Army&apos;s main problems is to increase the supply of officers,both from Sandhurst and other sources. In order to obtain more candidates for Sandhurst, 40 scholarships a year are being offered for boys who intend to apply for regular commissions, and more is being done to increase interestin Army careers among a wider circle of schools. Young men are also being offered 3-year short service commissions direct from civil life. At the sametime every effort is being made to ensure that all men in the ranks, who possess the necessary qualities, are given the opportunity to obtain both regular and short service commissions.6. During 1958, the RAP. obtained 13,000 recruits on engagementsof 5 years or more, compared with 9,000 in 1957. At this rate, the ceiling of 135,000 should be reached quite comfortably. Like the Army, the R.A.F.is having some difficulty in obtaining men for certain specialised branches in particular personnel for radio and radar and certain clerical and medicalduties. However, measures are being taken to overcome these deficiencies invarious ways.7. Entries of officer cadets into Cranwell and Henlow are reasonably satisfactory, but entries of aircrew, on direct and short-service commissions,are still appreciably below requirements. This may, in part, be dueto the impression that, with the advent of the rocket, aircraft will have littlepart to play. That is, of course, quite wrong. There will continue to be many important tasks which only manned aircraft can perform.8. The Women&apos;s Services, including the Nursing Services, have an indispensable part to play in the all-regular forces of the future, in peaceas well as in war; and they have been given responsibilities over a wide range of important duties. The Women&apos;s Services need some 6,000 recruits a year.Although the intake increased in 1958, the rate of recruitment for theW.R.A.C. and the W.R.A.F., is still considerably below requirements.Recruitment for the W.R.N.S. is satisfactory.Contraction of Forces. 9. In 1957, the combined strength of the three Services stood at nearly700,000. The decision to end National Service in 1962 and to re-organise the armed forces on a voluntary basis involved a reduction of about300,000. By 1st April, 1959, half this planned reduction will have beencompleted.10. The manpower of the Royal Navy has been reduced by 15,000 in thelast two years. The majority of the cuts have been effected in the base andtraining establishments and home air stations and other branches of the shoreorganisation.11. In the Army the changeover from National Service to a smallerall-regular force entailed reducing the number of major units by about 50.Nearly two-thirds of the necessary amalgamations and disbandments havebeen completed and much credit goes to officers and men of the unitsconcerned for their understanding and loyal co-operation in carrying through these unavoidable but none the less painful changes. Parallel with this, manyadministrative and headquarter units have been disbanded; and in the staticorganisation in the United Kingdom over 70 establishments have been closed down during the last two years.a
12. The R.A.F. has completed nearly two-thirds of its planned rundown.This has been made possible in part by reductions in the front line of fighter command, but principally by economies in the administrative and training establishments.Size of Army ,13. In assessing the manpower requirements of the Army, theGovernment had to take into account a variety of factors, including futureoverseas commitments and the effects of reorganising the armed forces onan all-regular basis. In this task, they were assisted by the authoritativereport of an expert Committee, under the chairmanship of General SirRichard Hull, set up by the Army Council in 1956. The Committee advised that, if it were decided to abolish National Service, it would be necessary tomaintain an all-regular Army of 197.000* men, of which about 60,000 wouldbe required for overseas service outside Germany and for the strategic reserve.14. However, the Hull Committee&apos;s report was based on assumptionswith regard to the strength of British forces in Germany and the degree ofcivilianisation in the United Kingdom which no longer hold good. These two factors, which together account for some 30,000 men, reduced the totalmanpower requirement to about 165,000. This includes a provision of about60,000 men for overseas service outside Germany and for the strategic reserve.15. Since it seems likely that more volunteers will come forward than can be accepted within a total strength of 165,000, the Government have considered whether the present ceiling should be rigidly maintained. Theyhave come to the conclusion that the plan for the all-regular Army is soundlyconceived. However, recent experience has shown that, if the manpower wereavailable, there would be advantage in augmenting the strength of individualunits serving overseas and in the Strategic Reserve so as to avoid excessivecross-posting. The Government have accordingly decided to allow thestrengths of these units to rise to a higher ceiling, in the case of infantry battalions to 775 as compared with 635 previously. If the current rate of recruiting is maintained there is good prospect of obtaining the additional menover the next few years. This would raise the total strength of the new regularArmy to about 180,000.16. The most striking change in the future composition of the Army is the big reduction that is being made in the military manpower employed on administrative and garrison duties in the United Kingdom. By the abolitionof National Service, with its large training organisation and other uneconomicoverheads, by the extensive replacement of uniformed men by civilians, andby the introduction of labour-saving methods and machinery, it will bepossible to dispense with over 100,000 soldiers who now have to be employedon non-combatant duties. Furthermore, the relative effectiveness of thepresent Army and the all-regular force of the future cannot be measuredsolely by numbers. Full account must also be taken of the greater efficiency of the long-service professional Army.Pay and Pensions17. Significant improvements in the conditions of service of the armed forces are being made. Last year the rates of pay were increased forall  ranks;  and  subsequently  the independent Advisory  Committee on* The figures of 165,000 and 197,000 relate to adult U.K. males (all ranks)3
Accommodation20. Good progress is being made with the improvement of the living conditions of the forces at home and overseas. The building programme forthe Services in the United Kingdom, estimated to cost about  90 millions over five years, is now well under way. A variety of new building projects and improvements to single accommodation is going ahead for all three services. In addition, more than 1,000 new houses have been completed during the past twelve months, and it is planned to start on a further 4,000during the coming year.21. Overseas the construction of modem barracks and houses for marriedpeople is continuing. Work will also start this year on new accommodation,including a primary school, for the Army in Kenya, and it is planned to build a new school in Aden. In addition about  1 million will be spent during thecoming year on improving accommodation and amenities in Cyprus. special attention is being given to working and living conditions in tropical stations,ashore and afloat. In certain exceptionally hot areas air-conditionedaccommodation is being provided. Accommodation and lay-out in ships is being continually improved. Features which are being incorporated inthe latest designs of new ships, and to the greatest extent possible inthose being modernised, include air-conditioning where appropriate, bunksleeping, centralised messing and modern labour-saving equipment.22. Considerable improvements have also been made in the quality of new furniture for barracks and married quarters. A number of clubs,sports-grounds, swimming-baths and N.A.A.F.I. buildings are being constructed or modernised.23. The architectural staffs of the Services are making every effort toensure that new buildings are attractively designed, and that housing estatesare well planned, in accord with the best professional standards. where necessary, outside architects with special experience are brought into consultation.Recruiting, under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg, recorded their viewthat the new rates now bear a fair relationship to civilian earnings, and, infact, that, &quot; taken as a whole, people in the Services are, if anything, a little better off than they would have been in civil life.&quot; The Government have accepted the Committee&apos;s recommendation that in future pay and pensions should be reviewed regularly at intervals of not more than two years. Thefirst such review will be carried out in time for any changes that may benecessary to take effect on 1st April, 1960.18. Pensions for other ranks are being substantially increased andterminal grants more than doubled. A sergeant, retiring after 22 years&apos;service, will now receive a terminal grant of about  550, instead of  225,&apos;and a pension of about  3 10s. Od. a week instead of  2 7s. 6d. a week. Infuture, widows of Servicemen of all ranks will receive pensions at the rateof one-third of their husband&apos;s retired pay. In most cases this will mean asubstantial increase.19. In accordance with the recommendations of the Grigg Committee,further improvements in Service allowances of various kinds are beingmade. These include higher compensation for the expense of movingfrom one station to another and increased grants for the education ofchildren. In addition, free passages will now be given to children at home to visit their parents abroad once a year.
Modernisation of Fleet24. Substantial progress is being made with modernising existing ships and bringing new ones into service.25. The first of the three Tiger Class cruisers will be commissionednext month. The conversion of H.M.S. Bulwark to the role of Commandocarrier will be completed during the course of the year. These developmentsrepresent a valuable addition to the naval forces available for the protection ofBritish territories and interests overseas.26. Three frigates of the new Tribal Class have been laid down. TheWessex all-weather helicopter has been ordered as a replacement for theWhirlwind and will become the Navy&apos;s main anti-submarine aircraft.27. The Fleet Air Arm is also receiving other new aircraft. these include the Scimitar single-seat fighter-bomber, now coming into service, andthe Sea Vixen two-seater all-weather fighter, which will follow during thecoming year and will be equipped with Firestreak guided missiles. It hasalso been decided to go ahead with the N.A.39, a strike-reconnaissance aircraft with high-speed performance at low level and well suited to limitedwar operations.28. Preliminary work has begun on four guided missile ships of theCounty Class, and two will be laid down in the near future. They will bepropelled by combined steam and gas turbine machinery of exceptionallycompact and light design which will increase the amount of fightingequipment they can carry. The trials of the Seaslug missile, with which theywill be equipped, have shown this to be a most effective weapon for the interception of attacking aircraft at long ranges. These ships will also carryshorter range guided missiles for close air defence.29. The first three submarines of the Porpoise Class were commissionedlast year, and two more will follow this year. The preparation of material for the construction of Dreadnought is proceeding. The progress of this project is being greatly advanced by the valuable assistance of the UnitedStates, from whom the first propulsion unit is being bought.Re-equipment of Army30. Having regard to the heavy cost of equipping the large numbersof men in the post-war National Service Army, it has been the policy of theWar Office to use up to the fullest extent possible the big stocks of oldertypes of equipment which were left over from the Second World War andwere further swelled by increased production during the Korean War. Thepresent five-year defence plan provides for the extensive re-equipment of theArmy, so that the smaller, but more highly trained, all-regular force of thefuture may operate with maximum efficiency.31. Work has for some time been proceeding on the developmentof a new family of weapons, vehicles and other equipment. These are now coming into service. Within the next twelve months, half the Army will havebeen re-equipped with F.N. rifles and deliveries of Sterling sub-machine gunswill be nearly completed. Two Artillery Regiments have been equipped withthe Corporal guided missile which has a range of 70 miles and can carry a nuclear warhead. Requirements of Ferret scout cars, Saladin armoured cars, and 1-ton armoured trucks will soon have been met in full. A largenumber of lorries, mostly based on commercial types, are being issued toreplace older vehicles in the Rhine Army and elsewhere. Radio communica-tions for the forces in the field are being greatly improved by the introduction
of new and more powerful signal equipments. These include the portableManpack, a radio-relay set for improving telephone -and telegraphcommunications in the field, and a set for armoured vehicles. Nearly halfthe Army&apos;s requirements for these sets have now been produced.32. Deliveries to the Army of the mobile anti-aircraft missileThunderbird, after successful trials in Australia, have now started and work is proceeding on the development of an improved version. Other weapons and equipment are in varying stages of development. These includeair-transportable anti-tank weapons, self-propelled guns, tracked vehicles,bridging equipment, short-range nuclear rockets and nuclear shells.Air Support and Mobility33. A general-purpose aircraft, the TSR.2, is being developed for thesupport of the Army and for other tactical operations. It will have asupersonic, low-flying, all-weather capability and will, in its strike and reconnaissance role, provide a suitable replacement for the Canberra. At thesame time it will meet the need for a versatile fighter-bomber to co-operate with troops in the field. The TSR.2 will be capable of carrying nuclear bombs and air-to-air guided missiles. Its ability to use airfields of moderatelength and light construction in forward areas will be of especial value inlimited war operations.34. In accordance with the Governments policy to increase the mobility of the armed forces, the carrying capacity of RAP. transport command will be further expanded. The Britannias will be coming into service this year for long range movement. These will release Hastingsaircraft for use in the tactical transport role.35. In addition, there is a requirement for long-distance air freighters,specially designed to carry bulky equipment, such as guided missiles andtheir associated radar vehicles. For this purpose, the Government haveordered a small number of the [Britannic/H.P. 111] aircraft, which is being developed with a civil use also in view.36. It has also been decided to increase the number of tacticalfreighters suitable for dropping parachutists, as well as for normal movements of troops and stores. This requirement will be met by a military version ofthe Armstrong Whitworth Argosy. For shorter range transport, TwinPioneers are beginning to come into service and will be followed later by alimited number of Bristol 192 helicopters.Strategic Bombers37. A growing proportion of the British strategic bomber force isbeing equipped with Vulcan and Victor aircraft. Their performance, in speed and altitude, remains unsurpassed by any bomber aircraft in service in anyother country; and recent competitions with the United States Air Force have demonstrated the precision of British navigational aids and bomb-aimingequipment.38. In addition to the already substantial stockpile of kiloton bombs,the production of British megaton weapons is proceeding steadily. The lastseries of British tests and the valuable exchange of information with theUnited States have enabled important technical advances to be made in the design of nuclear warheads. This will permit a significant increase in therate of production.
39. The development of propelled stand-off bombs continues to progresssatisfactorily. These will greatly reduce the vulnerability of the aircraft by enabling it to release its weapon a long distance from the target, outside the range of the missile defence system.Ballistic Rockets40. The Government have recently been reviewing the British rocketprogramme; and in this connection they have studied developments in theUnited States. The Americans are putting their main effort into inter-continental liquid-fuel missiles. In addition, they are developing a submarine-launched missile and a multi-stage, land-based rocket, bothemploying solid-fuel motors. Each of these latter systems offers certain advantages, though each also has its own drawbacks.41. As a result of this review, the Government have come to theconclusion that, on present knowledge, the British liquid-fuel rocket blue streak is best suited to British needs. The development of this weapon istherefore proceeding as planned.42. Thor missiles are being deployed by the R.A.F. for training purposes.The trials of the missile in America are proceeding well, and the United StatesGovernment confidently expect that the weapon will soon attain the exaotingstandards of range and accuracy specified for its operational performance.Air Defence43. The Lightning supersonic fighter, which will come into service nextyear, will initially be equipped with a Firestreak missile, and later with a more advanced weapon capable of intercepting the faster aircraft of the future.44. The task of defending the deterrent bases in Britain against attack by aircraft will be increasingly performed by ground-to-air missiles.Full-scale trials of the Bloodhound rocket have been carried out during thepast year and these weapons are now beginning to be deployed in anoperational role. A more advanced weapon with higher performance is being developed.45. During the coming year, the Civil Defence Organisation will bepaying special attention to the development, in training and exercises, of new techniques for dealing with radiological hazards. Essential communicationswill be further strengthened. Construction work for the Royal observer corps and the supply of measuring instruments will be accelerated. On the disbandment of the Mobile Defence Corps, the Territorial Army will be givenmore specialised training in civil defence.[See alternative version proposed by the Home Secretary attached.]Inter-Service Commands46. In theatres overseas, there are obvious operational advantages in placing the forces of all three Services under a unified Command.47. This system was introduced recently in the Aden Command, whereit is working smoothly and has proved its worth. It has been decided toset up, as soon as practicable, a similar inter-Service Command to embraceBritish naval, army and air forces in the Mediterranean area. The timing of this change will depend on the development of the internal situation in cyprus and certain other considerations. The possibility of setting up a unified Command in the Far East is also being examined.
Demands on Economy48. Before deducting expected receipts of  12 millions from Germany,the Defence Estimates for 1959-60 amount to  1,514 millions. That is some 10 millions higher than the expected total of Estimates and Supplementariesfor 1958-59. The increase is more than accounted for by additional charges of various kinds, including about  14 millions for rises in industrial wagesand prices,  6 millions for improvements in allowances and pensionsrecommended by the Grigg Committee and  2 millions for the recent increasein Civil Service pay.

CIVIL DEFENCEAlternative paragraphs proposed by the Home Secretary45. No major change is contemplated in the structure of civil defence,which continues to form an essential part of defence organisation. Duringthe coming year, the Civil Defence services will be paying special attentionto the development, in training and exercises, of new techniques for dealingwith radiological hazards. Further orders are being placed for trainingequipment and further deliveries of operational radiac instruments will bemade. Essential communications will be further strengthened, and as part ofthe development of the warning and monitoring organisation constructionalwork for the Royal Observer Corps will be accelerated.46. Although the prospective end of National Service has made itnecessary to disband the Mobile Defence Corps, the Territorial Army isto be given more specialised training in Civil Defence techniques, and close co-operation between the Army and the civil defence authorities willcontinue. A new field for recruitment will be opened up for the civil defence services with the freeing from Reserve liability of nearly 3 million menwhen in June the Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves Act, 1954, will cease to apply to men who entered the Armed Forces before 1949.
