secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. March 1959C. (59) 402nd March, 1959Copy No.51CABINETPAY OF THE HIGHER CIVIL service memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerEarly in 1957 the Government announced the appointment, under theChairmanship of Lord Coleraine, of a Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay ofthe Higher Civil Service. The Committee was appointed on the recommendationof the Royal Commission on the Civil Service under the Chairmanship ofSir Raymond Priestley, with the task of exercising a general oversight of the remuneration of the higher Civil Service; and it is responsible for advising theGovernment about that remuneration, either at the Governments request or on itsown initiative.2. The Priestley Commission, which reported in November 1955, envisaged that a general review of the pay of the higher Civil Service would be called forwithin a comparatively short time.  They said :  &quot; We think indeed it may well be that an early review will be called for,since we have deliberately refrained from making recommendations whichmight suggest that the Civil Service was in any way setting the pace or being in the van of a movement for a new approach to salaries for senior staffs.&quot;The Coleraine Committee decided on its own initiative to embark on such a review in the autumn of last year, and their recommendations for revised salaries for thehigher Civil Service were forwarded to the Prime Minister on 30th January in theletter reproduced in the Annex. These recommendations were published on12th February.3. The salary scales for the higher Civil Service which were introduced on therecommendation of the Priestley Commission related to conditions as at 1st July,1955, and became effective from 1st April, 1956. At the topTevels in the higher civil Service the rates recommended by the Priestley Commission are still in force.At lower pay levels of the higher Civil Service, minor adjustments in salary havebeen made on the recommendation of the Coleraine Committee itself, as a consequence of central pay settlements for the middle and lower grades. Thefollowing table shows for a selection of the more important grades the salary historysince Priestley and the effect of the Coleraine recommendations:  Permanent Secretary, top levelScientific and Legal PostsTop level Works Group and medical Posts    ......Deputy Secretary      ......Under Secretary      ......Assistant Secretary   ......Senior Principal ScientificOfficer and Works GroupSuperintending Grade ...PriestleySalary  &apos;6,0005,0004,2503,2502,000-2,6002.000-2,300CurrentSalary 6,0005,0004,2503,4002,200-2,700RecommendedSalary 7,0005,8005,0003,8002,400-3,0002,200-2,400      2,400-2,70054824B
The cost of the recommendations, and of the necessary adjustments in the gradesbelow Assistant Secretary which straddle the Principal^ maximum, is estimated at 1^ millions.4.   The increases recommended over current rates of pay are highest at the top, where they amount to an addition of one-sixth; at the other end of the scalethe increases vary from one-tenth to one-eighth.   The increases over the rates3&apos;jefiommended by the Priestley Commission are, however, one-sixth throughout,6except at the bottom of the range where they amount to one-fifth.5. In considering what should be done about these recommendations, we haveto decide a number of questions (i) Are the proposed increases reasonable on the merits?(ii) What alternatives are there to acceptance in full?   Is outright rejectionfeasible? Or partial implementation? Or acceptance in principle withdeferment?(iii) What repercussions would early implementation have?(iv) What would be the best timing of implementation?Are the Proposed Increases Reasonable on the Merits?6. We have no access to the figures which the Coleraine Committee had before them. There are, however, a number of factors which suggest that the increases are about right on a &quot; fair comparison &quot; basis (i) The salaries of Board members in the nationalised industries were substantially increased in 1957; e.g., the salary of a member of a majorBoard was raised by 25 per cent, from  6,000 to  7,500. It was withthis likely development in mind that the Priestley Commission expressedthe view (quoted above) that an early review of the salaries which theywere recommending for the higher Civil Service would be necessary.(ii) The recent award to Chief Officers of Local Authorities by the industrial court shows a pattern not dissimilar to the Coleraine recommendations.These officers last had their pay adjusted in April 1956, nine months later than the date (July 1955) from which the Priestley Commission^recommendations put the Civil Service in line with comparable outsideemployments. The Industrial Court has awarded increases of varyingamounts, rising to 15 per cent, of the  4,000 level; and the pattern isto be followed for County Council clerks, who are not specificallycovered by the award, with the result that the clerk with a salary of 5,000 will receive an increase of 20 per cent.(iii) At lower levels, the Civil Service central pay settlements for the middle and lower grades, which have been based on evidence about the generalmovement of wages and salaries in comparable employment, have hadthe cumulative effect of improving pay by 14-6 per cent.; and the wageindex shows what has been happening at the industrial level: thenew-style index which was introduced with effect from January 1956now stands at 116.7. The Coleraine Committee&apos;s recommendations seem reasonable, therefore,on merits. They reveal an intention to pull out to the full the &quot; concertina &quot; ofCivil Service pay; but the Committee clearly assume that their recommendations will have to hold the field for some time, even though there may be further paymovements lower down.8. Nevertheless, the Government is not bound to accept these recommendations and before we reach a decision it is right that we should examinethe other courses before us.Is Outright Rejection of the Recommendations Feasible?9. The Committee was set up by the Government on the advice of thePriestley Commission, which thought some such body was needed &quot; in the interestsof the public, of the civil servants concerned and the Service generally.&quot; TheCommittee is advisory but the Priestley Commission said that, though the
Committee would be an advisory body, &quot;it will be most unlikely that theGovernment will fail to take action when such a Committee tenders advice.&quot; Ineffect, the Committee was set up as a source of independent advice on the pay ofthe higher Civil Service; and, that being so, the Government cannot easily set asideits first major recommendations, unless there are compelling reasons.10. In present circumstances I can see no compelling reasons for rejection.And there are strong reasons against it. The Staff Side of the Civil Service national whitley Council certainly look on the Committee as the substitute of the higher civil Service for an arbitration tribunal; and they would react very strongly if theGovernment decided to reject completely the recommendations. Moreover, theeffect on recruitment to the higher classes of the Civil Service would be bad. TheService is in severe competition with other employers for its best recruits. Potentialrecruits accept that the Service cannot offer the more glittering prizes of private business. But they and those who advise the first-class people we need couldnot fail to notice the Government^ rejection of recommendations designed tobring the pay of the, higher Civil Service into reasonable line with comparableoutside employment.11.   There is also the effect on the Coleraine Committee itself to consider:rejection,of the recommendations would certainly irritate the members, who havetaken on a difficult job in the spirit of public service, and who in the form, substanceand timing of their report have, it seems clear, been at pains to embarrass theGovernment as little as possible.12. In my view outright rejection of the recommendations of the Committeeis for these reasons not practicable.Is there Anything to be said for a Partial Implementation of the Recommendations?13. It would be possible to implement the recommendations in full for thelower grades (say up to the Under-Secretary level), but to give the higher gradesno increase or a lower one than that recommended. The money saved would be small, the aim would be to avoid the public impact of an increase of  1,000 at the 6,000 income level, and the justification that the lower grades are feeling the pinchmore than the higher. There are, however, serious objections to any such proposals -(i) The &quot; concertina &quot; of Civil Service pay would once more be compressed.The Priestley Commission strongly deplored the tendency to allow thelower grades to encroach on the higher, and in their recommendations were particularly concerned to correct the results of this tendencyover the years immediately preceding their report. The ColeraineCommittee themselves are very much alive to the same point; this is why they have given bigger increases over current rates of pay at the top, and have in fact based their award on similar improvements forall grades over the rates recommended by the Priestley Commission.(ii) The recommendations would not be forgotten, and there would becontinuous and persistent pressure for their full implementation.(iii) The effect on recruitment would probably be as serious as if therecommendations were rejected in toto.14. There is, therefore, little to be said on the merits for partialimplementation of the recommendations on these lines.Could the Recommendations be Accepted in Principle and their ImplementationDeferred?15. Something of this kind was done in 1948 when the Committee on higher civil Service Remuneration under the chairmanship of Lord Chorley made recommendations about the pay of the higher Civil Service. The Governmentthen announced that it accepted the recommendations, but proposed to defertheir implementation because of the difficult economic circumstances; theywere eventually implemented in stages during 1950 and 1951. But the circumstance were very special. In 1948 the &quot; wage freeze &quot; was being applied, and in 1949 the devaluation crisis supervened. The present economic climate and prospects would hardly be generally accepted as sufficient justification for deferment on similar54824
lines. The direct impact of the Coleraine Committee&apos;s recommendations on the economy would be negligible. The indirect effects on the community generally are more difficult to gauge. The announcement of the recommendations hascertainly had little public impact, and it seems possible that their implementationwould have no more at the present time. Implementation later on could, however,be embarrassing if it happened to coincide with fresh Governmental pronounce-ments designed to secure restraint in the field of personal incomes, or with action by the Government aimed at moderation in pay claims and settlements in the public sector.16. It is therefore difficult to see any present advantages in acceptance for later implementation, and there may well be future embarrassment.What Repercussions Would Early Implementation of the Recommendations Have?17. Theoretically there should be no repercussions, since what theCommittee&apos;s recommendations ostensibly aim to do is to bring the Civil Service into line with other comparable employments. It should certainly prove possible to holdthis line so far as Board members and staffs in the nationalised industries areconcerned; for in their case the Priestley Commission^ report can be quoted as evidence that the adjustment of Board salaries which came in 1957 implied further changes in Civil Service pay, so that the converse cannot be true. So far as theLocal Authority world is concerned, Chief Officers of Local Authorities have justhad the award of the Industrial Court referred to above, which must be regardedas bringing them up to date on a fair comparison basis; similarly Chief Officers inthe London County Council had the award which followed the personal advice ofSir Edward Ritson in September 1958. As for the doctors, they have recently hada further interim increase and must now clearly wait for the results of the PilkingtonCommission^ work. There remains the possibility of repercussions on the salaries of University staffs, who had their last increase in August 1957. Acceptance of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations could encourage a claim from this quarter; but this may come in any case as a result of the recent increases given to teachers, doctors and the middle and lower grades of the Civil Service. Moreover a claim for higherUniversity salaries will inevitably come in the autumn as a result of the RoyalCommission on the Remuneration of Doctors and Dentists under the chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington.18. My conclusion is that we need not be inhibited, if we favour earlyimplementation, by the risk of repercussions.What Would be the Best Timing of Implementation?19. We have aimed to begin 1959 with a period of wage stability, and thequestion is, would acceptance of the Coleraine recommendations endanger thispolicy. The adjustment in the salaries of Board members in the nationalised industries which were made in the summer of 1957 attracted little comment, and do not appear to have been quoted in any of the major wage negotiations during that year; similarly, the announcements of the Coleraine Committee^recommendations and of the award to Chief Officers of Local Authorities duringthe last week or so have been taken very quietly. As a general rule, the industrialworker, when comparing his lot with that of others, tends to look sideways ratherthan upwards. This is not to say that there could not be a bad moment for implementing the Coleraine Committee&apos;s recommendations. If the announcement to that effect were to be made at a time when a rise of, say, 5s. Od. for workers in abasic industry was being resisted, some capital might well be made out of it. Butthe time of the announcement can be chosen to avoid this.20. My conclusion is that, since we are at present experiencing a period ofcalm on the wage front, the present would be the least embarrassing time to announce acceptance of the recommendations.Conclusion21. The conclusion which emerges from an examination of the questionsposed at the beginning of this memorandum is that, we should implement theColeraine Committee&apos;s recommendations in full (including the operative date of
1st February, 1959), and announce our intention of doing so in the early days ofMarch. The recommendations were published as a written answer to an inspiredParliamentary Question, and I think, we should make their acceptance known, inthe same way. :D. H. A.  .Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,27th February, 1959.ANNEXCOLERAINE   COMMITTEES   RECOMMENDATIONS30th January, 1959.Dear Prime Minister,1. In my letter of 29th May, 1958, I informed you that after carefulconsideration the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher CivilService had concluded that they should set about the collection of information withthe object of beginning in the autumn a general review of higher Civil Service pay.2. We received full co-operation from those whom we approached, whoprovided us, on a confidential basis, with much valuable information.3. In reaching our conclusion we have taken into account a number of factors. Our consideration began with the broad comparabilities established bythe recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service between the pay of the higher Civil Service and the levels of remuneration in the relevant outsidesectors in industry (both private and nationalised), in commerce, finance, andother public service (e.g., senior posts in the Local Authorities) and in the universities. We also considered, inter alia, the movements in pay at comparablelevels outside the Service since 1st July, 1955, the date to which the RoyalCommission^ proposals were related; and we took account of the three central pay settlements reached in relation to Civil Service grades within the arbitrable limit,as well as the relatively minor adjustments which we ourselves recommended as a consequence of the first and second of these settlements.4. Throughout our consideration of these matters we have had regard to theview which we share-that adjustments in the pay of the higher Civil service should, so far as possible, be made at relatively infrequent intervals and should notbe interpreted as setting the pace for salary increases elsewhere. Had it not been for this, we might well have embarked on a general review at an earlier stage, inthe light, of movements in pay levels which were taking place outside the CivilService. For the same reason, it is our hope that our recommendations will makea further general review of higher Civil Service pay unnecessary for some time tocome.  We shall, however, continue to watch the position.5. As regards the scope of our review, we have adhered to the position whichwe adopted at the start of our work, namely that, while our field of reference maybe taken to cover all grades regarded as above the arbitrable limit, our directconcern should be with the Assistant Secretary and comparable grades, and withthose above. We have limited our recommendations accordingly, in the belief that appropriate adjustments in the salaries of the remaining grades above the arbitrablelimit, consequential upon our recommendations, should without serious difficultybe capable of being made through the normal process of negotiation between theOfficial and Staff Sides. If, however, any major question of principle should arise in relation to these grades as a result of our recommendations, we should not wishto exclude its reference to us.
6. Our recommendations do not disturb the existing horizontal relativitiesbetween the various classes in the higher Civil Service. They do, however, have theeffect of increasing the gap between the minima of the scales at the lowest levelof those with which we are concerned and the maxima of the scales immediatelybelow. We do not consider that this gap should necessarily be maintained intactfor all time a point which will weigh with us in the event of our being asked toexamine proposals for adjustments in the minima of the scales with which we areconcerned if and when the maxima of those below are raised for any reason.7. We have related our recommendation for the salary of the permanent secretary to the Treasury to the Royal Commission^ view that the pay of thispost should be  1,000 greater than that of other Permanent Secretaries. Thisdifferential is at present shared between two Joint Permanent Secretaries.8.   Our recommendations, which are expressed in London terms, are:  -broadbanded onA dministrativePermanent Secretary to the TreasuryPermanent Secretary   ...Deputy SecretaryUnder-secretary assistant SecretaryExecutiveHeads of Major Establishments-the span   ...      ...      ...      .........Principal Executive OfficerScientificScientific Adviser to the Minister of Defence and secretary to the Department of Scientific andIndustrial ResearchChief Scientific Officer grade and other posts above broadbanded on the span       .........Deputy Chief Scientific Officer       .........Senior Principal Scientific Officer    .........Works GroupDirecting posts broadbanded on the spanSuperintending grade ...      ............LegalTreasury Solicitor, First Parliamentary Counsel and permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor ...Heads and Deputy Heads of Legal Departments broadbanded on the span       .........Principal Assistant Solicitor  ...      .........Assistant Solicitor      ...............MedicalChief Medical Officer, Ministry of Health  ......Other posts above Principal Medical Officer broad-banded on the span      ............Principal Medical Officer      ............Senior Medical Officer ............8,0007,0005,0003,8002,400-3,0003,000-3,8002,7007,0003,500-5,8002,800-3,1002,400-2,7003,000-5,8002,400-2,7007,0003,300-5,8003,8002,500-3,0005,8003,800-4,4003,3003,0009. Finally, we recommend that these proposals should take effect from 1st February, 1959.10. We assume that the National Staff Side will be informed of the terms ofour recommendations.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) COLERAINE.
