(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)rC.(59) 42 COPY NO.y Q5th March, 1959CABINETSECURITY MEASURES IN KENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies feel that I should let my colleagues know that the governor of Kenya, with my full support, is about to take certain measures toremove or minimise dangerous threats to security that now exist inthe Colony, particularly in Nairobi.2.      For&quot;some months the security situation has been deterioratingtowards a point when serious violence might occur at any time.There have already been incidents, themselves minor in character,but of potentially serious significance inasmuch as they constitutepart of an organised threat to law and order and, moreover, have beenstrikingly reminiscent of incidents which were taking place before theMau Mau rebellion broke out.   In January, for example, a party oftribal police were stoned when attempting to arrest a group of africans who were singing Mau Mau songs and causing a riot;   recentlyheadmen and tribal police have been stoned while collecting taxes inthe African locations;   and in one forest village a forest guardprevented tribal police from collecting tax.   We know from securityreports that African political leaders, in support of their campaign to break the present constitution, have been planning a &quot;positive action&quot;campaign to increase their pressure on the Government.   As part oftheir political action African leaders have openly encouraged thebuilding up of Jomo Kenyatta as the hero of the &quot;fight for freedom&quot;.There is little doubt that Mboya, the most influential African leader,has engaged himself in a definite war of nerves, designed not only toput pressure on the Government to meet his unacceptable demandsbut also to provoke the Europeans to take retaliatory action or,possibly, so to demoralise them that they may begin to feel that it isno longer worth while trying to make a permanent home in the Colony.Mboya and some of his colleagues have been seriously discomfitedby the failure of their attempt to organise a boycott of the Queen Mother&apos;visit, and it is conceivable that this set back may stimulate him toattempt to regain lost ground by some more dramatic action involving a threat to order.3.      On the other hand, it may be that Mboya has no intention butto carry on in much the way as he is acting at the moment, i. e. robustagitation short of positive incitement to -violence;  but even if this were true, there is no guarantee that he could control the presentdangerous situation or that some particular incident, minor in itself,might not spark off real trouble.-1-
4.      One of MboyaTs instruments is the African newspaper whichhe owns called &quot;Uhuru&quot;.    For many months this paper has beenpublishing material of a most inflammatory kind which has clearly hadno other object but to encourage racial hatred.   It was in this news-paper, for example, that Mboya recently published his unfoundedallegations that there was a European plot to bring arms from central africa into Kenya;  and this paper has been very largely instrumentalin encouraging the growth of the Kenyatta cult.   Another instrumentat Mboya&apos;s disposal is the very large number of unemployed Africans(about 10,000 at present) who have drifted into Nairobi from the reserves.5.      The campaign of the Africans has in fact drawn the expectedreaction from some of the more extreme elements among the europeans, despite the continued statesmanlike approach of men likeMr. Michael Blundell, a prominent Appointed Member of the Councilof Ministers, and his more moderate colleagues!   In one instance theGovernor is satisfied that defensive action by the Europeans has gonetoo far.   I refer to a European-owned publication called &quot;Comment&quot;(now renamed &quot;The Independent&quot;) which has also been publishinginflammatory material.6. It is against this background that the Governor has decided, with my approval, to take the following measures:-(a) It is intended to proscribe both &quot;Uhuru&quot; and &quot;Comment&quot;.(b) There is to be an intensification over a period of several months of the efforts of the Kenya Government to remove vagrants fromNairobi and to ensure that they do not return.   They now expect todeal with at least  300 vagrants a week.   Each vagrant will be subjectto a court order and returned to his district and any found to havefiltered back into Nairobi will be liable to imprisonment.(c) The Kenya Government intend to remove about 100 members ofthe Kikuyu, Embu and Meru tribes who are strong-arm men of Mboya&apos;party, the Nairobi Peoples  Convention Party, or who are known tohave taken a leading part in demonstrations against authority.   their removal will be phased over several weeks.(d) The Kenya Government also intend to remove under emergency regulations, and to restrict to their home areas, eleven other membersof Mboya&apos;s party who are also strong-arm men, but who do not belong to the Kikuyu, Embu or Meru tribes.(e) It is further intended to issue a twenty-eight days detentionorder against E.O. Agar, the Editor of &quot;Uhuru&quot; and also the OrganisingSecretary of the Nairobi Peoples Convention Party, and S. Maina, thehead of the women&apos;s wing of that party.   The Kenya Government expectsoon to have a sufficiently good case against both to detain them.   If,however, it appears later that the case is not strong enough, both willbe repatriated to their districts and restricted like the others.7.      The Kenya Government will be making an announcement about these measures on Friday morning, 6th March.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.4th March, 1959
