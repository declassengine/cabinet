(b) That concurrently some increase, averaging about 10 percent, should be made in the pension rates of existing service widows.2.      In his paper (C(59) 2) the Chancellor opposes both theseproposals, on the grounds that the second proposal would lead toexpensive repercussions in other fields and that the two proposals areinseparable.Future widows of existing pensioners3.      The Grigg Committee clearly intended that their recommendations should be applied to the future widows of those already retired.   Thatis the natural interpretation of the wording of their recommendation.Moreover, one of the results of restricting the application of the Griggformula to the future widows of those now serving would be thatwidows&apos; pensions at the new rates would not, except in a few cases of early death, begin to be paid for upwards of twenty years.   Meanwhile,the existing rates, stigmatised by the Grigg Committee as &quot;derisory&quot; and&quot;scandalously low&quot;, would continue to be paid for thirty or forty years.I do not believe that this is a tenable position.Existing widows4.      It is true that the Grigg Committee made no proposals for improving the pensions of existing widows;  but this was not becausethey thought there was no case for it.    The sentence which the Chancellorquotes from paragraph 119 of their report is followed by one which reads as follows :-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST YTS GOVERNMENT)C(59) 5 COPY NO.^O14th January, 1959CABINETSERVICE WIDOWS1 pensions memorandum by the Minister of defence the Grigg Committee recommended that future widows&apos;pensions should be increased to give widows one-third of the pension which their husbands were drawing.    I have put two proposals to theChancellor of the Exchequer:-(a)     That the Grigg Committee&apos;s formula should apply not onlyto the future widows of officers and other ranks now serving but also to the future widows of those alreadyretired.
&quot;But when people hear of the widows of Servicemenbeing paid pensions of 13s. Id. a week, they form theopinion that the Armed Forces are not good employers;this can have a significant indirect effect on the willingness of men and women to volunteer. &quot;5.      Since the publication of the report, there has been growing publicpressure to improve the position of these widows;  and in the House on24th November I made the following statement, with the Chancellor&apos;s agreement:-&quot;The Government have every sympathy with thesewidows; and I may add that we are going into the whole matter at present to see whether there are any validgrounds on which we could reasonably justify makinga differentiation in favour of this category ofpensioner. 116.      There is plenty of evidence that public opinion, as expressed inParliament, in the Press, and in the correspondence received by ministers, regards Service widows as being in a special categorya.nd would be quite prepared to see them treated differently, as in factthey always have been in the past.7.      I believe, therefore, that fears of expensive repercussions willnot prove to be well founded.     It may be remembered that, a few months ago, similar apprehensions were expressed about introducing the newfamily pensions scheme on a non-contributory basis.     But, so far asI know, there have been no repercussions whatsoever.recommend ndat i on8.      I therefore ask the Cabinet to appro- e my proposals as set outin paragraph 1.     The cost next year would be about  170,000, whichhas already been allowed for in the sketch Estimates of the service departments.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.14th January, 1959.2
