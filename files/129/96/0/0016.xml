SECRETPraiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1959C. (59) 166th February, 1959CABINETSTRATEGIC AIR FREIGHTERSMemorandum by the Prime minister on 26th January the Minister of Supply informed the House of commons that the Government^ policy as regards a strategic air freighter would be announced shortly and that we did not intend to order an American aircraft forthis purpose. Since then, this question has been examined in detail by the DefenceCommittee and the Committee on Civil Aviation Policy; and the matter must nowbe decided by the Cabinet. In this memorandum I attempt to summarise the main issues involved:  2.   The requirement is for an aircraft which:  (a) will be able to transport heavy and bulky military equipment over longdistances;(b) will be available by the mid-1960s.3.   There are two &quot; firm &quot; candidates:  (i) The Britannic 3, manufactured by Short Brothers and Harland Limited.(ii) The H.P.111, manufactured by Handley-Page Limited.Both are adaptations of existing aircraft and should therefore be capable of being insquadron operation by 1964 although the H.P.111 would probably be some sixmonths or more later than the Britannic 3. The Minister of Supply&apos;s view is thatthe H.P.111 will be about 12^ per cent, dearer than the Britannic 3, i.e., about 200,000 per aircraft or  2 millions over 10.4. The information supplied by the manufacturers suggests that on purely military grounds the H.P. 111 would be the more suitable aircraft for the following reasons:  (a) It will have a longer range 3,850 nautical miles as compared with 3,640nautical miles for the Britannic 3.(b) It will have a greater payload over long stages.   At the maximum rangeits payload will be 37,500 lb. as compared with 29,000 lb. for theBritannic 3.Copy No.1SECRET
(c) It has a higher ceiling its operational height is 40-45,000 ft. as compare&apos;with the 20-35,000 ft. of the Britannic 3.(d) It will be faster its cruising speed will be 472 knots as compared with310 knots for the Britannic 3.(e) It offers more possibility of further development.- &quot;t!5. These arguments have to be weighed against considerations of civilaviation and industrial policy. Here our objective is two-fold first, to seek tosecure a footing in the new enterprise of civil air freighting, which may perhaps be on the point of expanding considerably; second, to give the maximumencouragement to employment and industrial expansion in this country. these considerations point to the Britannic 3 rather than to the H.P. 111 for the following reasons:  &apos;(a) The Britannic 3 is easier to load.(b) It is cheaper to operate on the short and medium-range flights where civil(as distinct from military) air freighting will tend to be most economic.It therefore offers greater scope for civil application than the H.P.111,the cost advantage of which does not begin to be apparent until the range exceeds 2,000 miles.(c) Handley-Page have no long-term future except in association with someother company; and to award them the contract for the strategic airfreighter would therefore be to reverse our policy of a progressiverationalisation of the aircraft industry. Shorts, on the other hand,are of direct concern to us not merely because we own the companybut also because it provides one of the main sources of employmentin Northern Ireland. Its present labour force is 7,500; but, in theabsence of new work, this figure will fall to about 1,500 by next year.To award the contract to Shorts would not merely postpone thisdisastrous redundancy; it would also offer to Shorts themselves a chance of surviving and possibly playing a significant part in theproduction of further aircraft for an expanding freighter market. Thereis of course no certainty that either aircraft would attract a worthwhilecivil market.6. The arguments are very evenly balanced; and neither course is whollysatisfactory. In C. (59) 17 the Minister of Supply has described a third possibilitywhich, in his view, avoids most of the disadvantages inherent in either theBritannic 3 or the H.P.111. The Cabinet will need to consider this proposal in thelight of the facts which I have outlined in this memorandum.H. M.10, Downing Street, S.W. I,6th February, 1959.SECRET
