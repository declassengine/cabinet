THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT FOR WORKERS ON SHORT TIMEMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceMy colleagues will wish to be aware of a potentially awkward situationrelating to the payment of unemployment benefit to workers on short time, mainly in Lancashire, and of the action proposed to deal with it.2. For many years, going back to the old Unemployment Insurance Acts, ithas been the rule that unemployment benefit is not paid to a worker who has worked during the week in question to &quot; the full normal extent.&quot; This rule isbased on case law made by the Umpires who decided questions under the old Acts.In 1948 the Minister of Pensions, Mr. Griffiths, made regulations dealing with thismatter, and assurances were given that these regulations involved no change but merely codified the existing case law. Under the National Insurance Acts these regulations fall to be construed in their application to individual claims by thestatutory authorities set up under those Acts, with the National InsuranceCommissioner as the final authority.3. Since 1948 until recently there has been little occasion to test theapplication of these regulations to the situation caused by prolonged short time.There have, however, been decisions of the National Insurance Commissionerwhich suggest that he is inclined to construe the regulations to the effect that,where a man has been on short time for a year, that short time has become hisnormal pattern of working, and that therefore he is not eligible for unemploymentbenefit for the days on which he does not work. He has qualified this doctrineby excepting from it a situation arising from &quot; exceptional industrialcircumstances,&quot; but it appears that such circumstances are those relating to the.man and his employer, not to a large section of an industry.4. There are at present in Lancashire some 10,000 cotton workers who havebeen working on short time for about a year and there are pockets of such workersin other industries, such as pottery, and in other parts of the country. The TradesUnion Congress (T.U.C.) are much concerned by what they regard as the likelihood of the early withdrawal of benefit from such workers, and I saw a deputation from them on 14th January, 1959. They urged on me the making of amendingregulations and were not disposed to co-operate in the taking of a test case to theCommissioner on the grounds apparently that they had little doubt that such a test case would produce a decision involving the withdrawal of benefit in all suchcases.5. It so happens, however, that two cases in which this question is raisedwill come before a Tribunal of Commissioners on 19th February, 1959. Iunderstand that it is likely that they will give a decision of general application.Pending this, the Chief Insurance Officer has felt able to give guidance to insuranceofficers which secures that benefit is not withdrawn.6. I have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofLabour, and the Ministerial Committee on the Cotton Industry under thechairmanship of the President of the Board of Trade has also discussed the effectof a decision that benefit is no longer payable to these workers.  Although therePrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1959C. (59) 3013 th February, 1959Copy No.CABINET54752
is clearly a case on economic grounds for allowing such a decision to take effect and for withdrawing benefit from men who have been on short time for a year,I am quite sure that the consequences of such a withdrawal would be most fortunate. It would be very difficult in 1959 to be more austere on this subjectthan were our predecessors in the twenties and thirties, and the T.U.C., who know of the assurances given in 1948, have already shown the strongest feeling on thematter.- With the agreement, therefore, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Labour, and of the Cabinet Committee on the Cotton Industry,I have prepared draft amending regulations which will secure that benefit is not withdrawn. If the effect of the Commissioner^ decision is such that, in the absenceof such further action, insurance officers would feel bound to disallow benefit to workers in the category described above, I propose to put these draft regulationsinto effect under a procedure which permits of their immediate application.J. A. B.-C.Mirtistry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C.2,13th February, 1959.
