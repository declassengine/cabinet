(59) 3525th February, 1959CABINET&apos; GUY BURGESSMemorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign affairs on 17th February the Cabinet asked the Foreign Secretary, in consultationwith the Attorney-General, to ascertain whether there was any evidence of seditiousbehaviour by Guy Burgess in the Soviet Union, and to arrange for him to bedissuaded from attempting to return here (C.C. (59) 10th Conclusions, Minute 5).Since then Burgess has made an approach to the Prime Minister in Moscow andthe Cabinet may wish to deal with all the aspects of this problem together, includingthe possibility of preventing his entry into the United Kingdom until he has satisfieda strict test of identity and nationality.2. The Attorney-General has reviewed the evidence against Burgess and is satisfied that it is quite insufficient to sustain a prosecution under Section I ofthe Official Secrets Acts. Nor does it seem likely that any further evidence willbe found. We cannot hope to obtain legal proof that Burgess has committed anytreasonable act while in the Soviet Union or any seditious act here. Evidencedoes exist that he has committed technical breaches of Section II of the official secrets Acts, in so far as he has improperly retained official classified documents in his possession. But these documents are of little significance and the Attorney-General would not be willing to proceed on such a minor charge.3. It will therefore be impossible to dissuade Burgess from trying to returnto this country by confronting him with evidence on which he might be prosecuted.Indeed if he knew how little evidence we had, he would be more likely to be encouraged than deterred. This applies also to a possible prosecution forhomosexuality.4. So far as entry into the United Kingdom is concerned, I understand fromthe Home Secretary that, in practice, it would be impossible for the immigrationauthorities to maintain for any length of time that they were not certain of Burgess&apos;sidentity. He would doubtless have documents with him which confirm his identityand he could in any event arrange for Mr. Driberg and perhaps other friends tomeet him and identify him on arrival. Once identified, he could hardly be refused admission on nationality grounds since he is known to have had British nationalityon his departure and he has not since renounced it formally: he therefore remainsa British subject, even though he may have taken Soviet nationality.5. Burgess&apos;s approach in Moscow was made through a journalist andamounted to a request for a safe conduct to enable him to visit his mother in theUnited Kingdom for a month. He promises to cause no embarrassment forHer Majesty&apos;s Government and asks the Prime Minister to give an undertaking that he would be free to return to Moscow after his visit.  The Delegation, in54797
reporting this, suggests that the reply should be delayed until the last moment and that it should simply be to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are notprepared to give Burgess any travel facilities.6. The proposed answer fits in well with our aim of discouraging Burgessfrom returning to the United Kingdom. However, since Burgess could enter thiscountry without difficulty even if we refuse him travel facilities (i.e., by decliningto renew his passport^ we should have to be ready to defend such a refusal ono -jf the grounds of public policy (e.g., by saying that it is one thing for Burgess to exercise &apos; 1* his right of entry as a British subject but quite another for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to help him to do so). It is also for consideration whether it wouldnot be wise to add to the proposed reply a statement to the effect that the PrimeMinister could not possibly give the guarantee for which Burgess asks as thequestion whether he should be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Acts is one for the Attorney-General. This glimpse of a possible prosecution should add toBurgess&apos;s doubts about the advisability of returning. The Security Service have endeavoured to convey to him hints to the effect that the dangers of prosecutionare real and the evidence stronger than he may think and they propose to continuethis process.7. I therefore recommend that we should remind the Prime Minister thatBurgess could easily enter the United Kingdom without British travel facilities and that a refusal of them might have to be defended on grounds of public policy:but that, on this understanding, we agree that Burgess should be told that her majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to give him travel facilities; and that wesuggest that it should be added that it would be impossible for the Prime Minister,or anyone else, to give a guarantee of safe conduct.D. Q.-G.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,25th February, 1959.
