(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC- MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTCON FIDE NT had CABINET OFFICcRECORD copy .(53) 247 COPY NO.   6i4TH SEPTEMBER, 1953CABINETUNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLYCHINESE REPRESENTATIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the problem of Chinese representation in the United Nations general assembly is likely to be raised by the Soviet Union when the 8th Session conveneson 15th September.    It is a problem which has been raised in United Nationsbodies on many occasions since the Central People&apos;s Government came to power.In order to avoid open disagreement between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and theUnited States Government there has been an understanding with the Americanssince May, 1951 under which, whenever this question is raised in any united nations body, the United States Delegation immediately puts forward a proceduralmotion proposing that consideration of this problem be postponed for the dura-tion of the meeting in question.    This procedure has been justified on the groundthat it would be premature to consider the question of Chinese representation solong as the Korean war continued.    It will however not be so easy to dispose of this problem in future.2.        Wide sections of American opinion are almost hysterical about thequestion and it has a great political significance in this country too.    It isprobable that the American Government will wish to propose a moratorium forthe whole of the 8th Session.    This would imply putting the matter into cold storage until the 9th Session in the autumn of next year.    I doubt whetherpolitical opinion in this country would be happy if Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere to support a proposal for a moratorium of this length of time.    I accord-ingly instructed the United Kingdom Delegation in New York to proposetentatively to the United States Delegation a formula for a moratorium on thefollowing lines:&quot;&quot;The Assembly decides to $postpone consideration of allproposals to exclude the representatives of the Government ofthe Republic of China and to seat representatives of the central people&apos;s Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China until such time as the Assembly has been able to consider theposition in the light of developments resulting from theAssembly resolution of 28th August concerning the establish-ment of a Political Conference on Korea, &quot;. 3,        The United States Delegations first reaction was that it would be verydifficult for the United States Government to accept anything less satisfactoryfrom their point of view than last year&apos;s formula (i. e. postponement for the duration of the Assembly^ Session).    On their suggestion H. M. ambassador in Washington raised the matter with Mr. Dulles, whose first reaction was that
/GoAmerican public opinion would interpret the formula as an undertaking to admit the Chinese Communists in return for good behaviour by them.    He has promised us his considered views.4.        If the United States Government are nevertheless prepared to accepta formula of the nature suggested in paragraph 2, I recommend that the UnitedKingdom Delegation be instructed to support it.    I think it is compatible withthe statements which have been made in Parliament.    We have there stated thatin considering this problem we must take into account the observation of thearmistice agreement itself, the progress made at the Political Conference andalso the development of our relations with the People&apos;s Government of China,the way in which our Mission in Peking is treated and the treatment of ourtraders in China.    The Minister of State on 30th July pointed out in the House ofCommons that these are all matters which must be considered and must enterinto our judgment in making up our minds on this question of Chineserepresentation in the United Nations.5.        I regard it as of the highest importance that we do not immediately againsubject Anglo-American relations to a strain such as that which arose from oursponsorship of India for membership of the Political Conference.    In view ofthe strength of American feeling on this subject, open opposition to an Americanmoratorium, proposal for a whole year, if they insist on putting it forward, wouldbe likely again greatly to arouse American public opinion.    If, therefore, theUnited States Government will not agree to any moratorium of less than a year&apos;sduration, I recommend the United Kingdom Delegation be instructed to abstainon any vote.    But in view of the the embarrassment which such action might cause to the Government in Parliament here - especially in view of the factthat both the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of State have publicly expressedthe opinion that the People&apos;s Government of China should be a member of theUnited Nations - I feel that the prior approval of my colleagues is required.S.Foreign Office, S.W.I.4TH SEPTEMBER, 1953.
