Since the abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in October, 1951, thesituation in the Zone has been abnormal. A practically continuous campaign hasbeen waged by the Egyptians against our forces. This campaign has sometimestaken the form of the denial of supplies of local goods which our forces are in the habit of buying from the Egyptian market. At other times a much more seriousform of gang activity has been directed against our installations, transport and communications. Cable cutting by some of these gangs has continued off and onthroughout the period. The more exposed married quarters have suffered con-stanlly from housebreaking and petty thieving. Throughout the whole area our forces have been contained in the Zone, unable to enter the Delta, and deeply committed to guard and internal security duties.3. After a fairly quiet winter a campaign, mainly directed towards the theftof vehicles, was intensified during March and April; as a result, it eventuallybecame necessary to establish movement control posts and to move military andBritish civilian vehicles in convoy under escort. These posts were told to stop onlyBritish military vehicles which they suspected of being stolen; they were not to stopor search civilian and Egyptian Government vehicles.44778TOP secret. 153) 2464th September, 1953
4. Since May even more widespread security measures have had to be taken.In order to maintain safe areas throughout the Zone, guards and pickets for theprotection of Headquarters, installations and living areas have had to be established.More recently it has become necessary &quot;&apos;to support these guards and pickets byarmed posts of up to Company strength. Additional posts have had to beestablished on the roads in the Canal Zone for checking vehicle traffic, preventing the introduction of either arms or terrorists into the Zone, and stopping the theftof vehicles. s:Present Situation5. After another relatively quiet period the situation took a turn for the worseduring the first fortnight of August. The Egyptian ban on the sale of goods toBritish forces was intensified; thefts of W.D. vehicles increased in number; andthere have been several incidents in which British soldiers have been shot inunprovoked attacks. The deliberate use of fire-arms by the Egyptians concerned is a new and disturbing development. There is secret evidence that these incidentsare being planned by &quot; Liberation Units &quot; encouraged by the Egyptian ArmyIntelligence Headquarters, which is stationed within the Zone.6. On 13th August, Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo made a strong protest to the Egyptian Foreign Minister about the increase in the number andseriousness of the incidents. The situation throughout the Zone subsequentlyquietened down a clear indication that the various outrages were officiallyinspired. There is no guarantee, however, that incidents may not recur at anytime. Anti-British feeling is very prevalent and can easily be brought to intensity:the situation could deteriorate sharply at very short notice. There have, in fact,already been one or two isolated unprovoked shooting incidents since the representations of Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo.7. During recent weeks the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, have endeavoured to ensure an atmosphere favourable to the defence negotiations in cairo and have therefore taken only the minimum steps to safeguard the immediateposition. To this end, incidents have been dealt with locally as they arose, in orderto prevent a repetition at the same place. No widespread retaliatory actionthroughout the Zone has been attempted. This course of action has clearly beenineffective in deterring the Egyptians from outrages elsewhere, and the commanders-in-Chief now fear that they are in danger of progressively losing theinitiative militarily. If a further widespread outbreak of violence should occur,they consider that the position would rapidly become critical, and that a quickdecision would then have to be made to take effective preventive action throughoutthe Zone in order to secure the position of their forces, rather than continue to sacrifice the lives of British soldiers piecemeal in the hope of carrying on the nego-tiations in Cairo. We are in complete accord with this view of our Commanderson the spot.Implementation of measures to maintain our position in Egypt8. It will be recalled that in May the Cabinet Defence Committee approved in principle (D (53) 9th Meeting, Minute 4) certain military measures (Annex toD (53) 25) considered essential to maintain our position in Egypt in emergency.Ministers specified, however, that none of these measures should be implementedunless the specific authority of Her Majesty&apos;s Government had been given at thetime the only exception to this ruling was that certain immediate precautionary measures (Serials 1 to 4) should be authorised by the British Defence Co-Ordination Committee, Middle East, if the emergency was such that, in theiropinion, time did not permit of reference back to London.9. The British Defence Co-ordination Committee have reported that, if thesituation does deteriorate in the way they fear, they would wish to implement assoon as practicable Serials 1 to 5, 7, 8, 10, 15 and possibly 14. They will not,of course, seek Ministerial approval for these measures until the emergency isimminent. But a very early decision will then have to be taken in London, inorder to deal with a rapidly deteriorating situation. In view of this, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment might consider it prudent to delegate authority for the taking of theappropriate decisions in this connection to the three Ministers most concerned-viz., the Prime Minister, the Acting Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence.It will be recalled that this was done in similar circumstances in July 1952.   In
(Signed)        J. HARDING.G. GRANTHAM, V.C.N.S.J. BAKER, V.C.A.S.this connection, also, Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo has requested that,unless there is &quot; a really major emergency to the security of our forces,&quot; he maybe consulted before any decisions are taken, in view of their inevitable repercussions on Anglo-Egyptian relations (Cairo to Foreign Office telegram No. 1214).Issuing of a Warning Statement to the Egyptian Government10. There is one other matter to which we wish to draw the attention ofHer Majesty&apos;s Ministers. Twice in the recent past, when the tempo of incidents inthe Canal Zone was high, an immediate improvement in the situation was achievedas the result of a direct formal protest to the Egyptian authorities. In the firstinstance the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt (GeneralFesting) approached the Military Governor in Port Said; on the second occasionHer Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo made a strong protest to the egyptian foreing Minister.11. We consider that not much would be achieved by making anotherapproach at either of these levels. We feel, however, that the effect on the egyptians would be considerable if, at an appropriate time, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were to deliver a strong warning to the Egyptian Government that,unless they maintained law and order, the United Kingdom reserved the right totake whatever action in the Canal Zone she deemed necessary for the security ofher forces and property. Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo is in accord with this view (Cairo to Foreign Office telegram No. 1214).Recommendations12.   We recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers should:  (a) Take note of the seriousness of the situation in the Canal Zone of Egypt;(b) Agree that responsibility for authorising military measures in Egypt inan emergency should devolve upon the Prime Minister, the ActingForeign Secretary and the Minister of Defence;(c) Agree that, if the situation in the Canal Zone deteriorates, they should consider issuing a formal warning to the Egyptian Government aboutthe maintenance of law and order.
