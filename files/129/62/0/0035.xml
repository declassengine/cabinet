HI i~)(*cj*h-JM|ffH  H-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) ^|I SECRET|H              C. (53) 235                                                                               COPY NO. 3 ^ |\H17th AUGUST, 1953.CABINETTHE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION???1                                  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies ?????The Conference on the Nigerian Constitution under my chairmanship PAP9JPAH             has been sitting daily (with one day off) since 30th July.  Its hours have usually ^^HPVAV             been from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3.30 p.m. till 6. HVVj2. As I write this the news gleaned from reliable sources is that the PABVJPAH              Conference is about to break down on the subject of Lagos.  The quarrel is a ^^^PNigerian quarrel and not between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Nigerians* ^^^PPbVJ              I fear that I must trouble my colleagues with some account of the background ^^^Pand of the issues involved. PwABj3. British Africa has a population of 60 millions of which Nigeria Lf&amp;Vaccounts for more than half.   Of the 30 million Nigerians about 17 million ^^^PPVAJ              are Northerners.   The revenues have risen from  5-7 millions immediately ^^^Pbefore the war to  44 millions last year.  As my colleagues will recall, the ^^^PPAH              present constitution originated about two years ago under the auspices of the PABVJ^PwJ              Labour Government.   It provides for a federal system of Northern, Western PABWJand Eastern Regions under a Central Government at Lagos.   Lagos is ^^^PPJ       incorporated in the Western Region but remains the capital.   It is unnecessary ^^^PPWAP              to give an account of the tangled reasons which have led to the breakdown of the PwABjconstitution.   The present Conference was convened to consider its amendment. PABVJI will confine myself to the main issues. -BBVJPAH                4,             Nigeria is inhabited by many races and no doubt the delegates would PABWJgive the anthropologist some pause.   Through their cranial differences he could PwABjperhaps trace some of the twelve races of Nigeria.   For my purposes it is PwABjP^H              enough to point to three main divisions - the Hausa and Fulani of the North, PVAB|PVAP              Muslims and warriors, with the dignity, courtly manners, high bearing and PwABJconservative outlook which democracy and the Daily Mirror have not yet debased; JPwABjgBH              and the Yoruba West and Ibo East, pagan or Christian, with higher education PVABJPAH              and lower manners and inferior fighting value, somewhat intoxicated with PwABjPAH              nationalism, though loyal to the British connection at least so long as it suits PVABJPVAV             them. PVAH5.             The Northern spokesman is Abubakar Balewa - his soubriquet PwABJ^^P               &quot;the golden voice of the North&quot; - a natural orator with real eloquence, nearly PVAHPAH              perfect English and all the arts of modulation at his command.   The East is PwABJrepresented by Dr. Azikiwe, an American-educated demagogue, who makes few BVAHinterventions but is able, persuasive, apparently moderate and wholly BMVAJunreliable; the West by Mr. Awolowo with a flood of words always on the same PwABJBBVJ              wave length, a lawyer with considerable legal equipment and outstanding BABBJPAH              ambition.  He is no more reliable than his Eastern colleague.  The last two are BVAHKVfl -i-
in an unholy but I believe temporary alliance,   I can only claim as chairman tohave concealed, I hope completely, the mounting impatience and deepeningcynicism with which I have looked out upon this motley assembly tacklingK     the niceties of constitutional balance.   The fundamental cleavage is of courseV     between the Muslim North and the pagan and Christian South, that is the Easternand Western regions*  It was asking much to expect so widely divergentelements to work an elaborate constitution.6, Apart from these fundamental racial and religious differencesone of the principal causes of the breakdown of the present constitution in myopinion has been that the regions were not given enough autonomy; another isthat the Central Legislation and Executive were selected under the constitutionby the Regions, which thus acted as sort of electoral colleges for the Centre.The first of these disabilities we have overcome at the Conference bygreater devolution, that is by a much shorter list of exclusive Federal powersand by leaving wide residual powers to the Regions*I tried to persuade the Conference to adopt separate electionsfor the Centre so as to resolve the second problem but I have been unsuccessful.The second difficulty has been indeed perpetuated by the Conferenceunanimously adopting the old system.   One political party, the NationalI Independence Party, withdrew at this point, not without substantial reasons*The causes for this perverse and pusillanimous decision to leave ill aloneare easily understandable but are outside the scope of this paper.7, The controversy over the whole constitutional issue is a controversybetween Nigerians and not between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Nigerians.I have thus tried to guide and not to impose.  A large number of reefs hasbeen navigated by agreement, but the ship is now about to wreck itself onLagos island.8* The North with their deep but already somewhat shaken trust inthe British and distrust of their &quot;brothers&quot; in the West and East fear that thegreater autonomy now suggested for the Regions will lead to the West secedingwhen it suits them.   The West incorporates Lagos, at once the commercial andpolitical capital of Nigeria and the only effective outlet to the sea for the tradeand commerce of the North.9. These fears are not groundless or insubstantial.   The North nowinsist upon Lagos being a federal area under separate administration so as tosafeguard it from becoming a Yoruba preserve and to make sure that theirI access to the sea remains open*  The East, though ostensibly wishing to deferdiscussion on Lagos, are known to share the views of the North*10. We cannot let the North down.   They are more than half the population,more attached to the British and more trustful of the Colonial Service than theother two*The West will not agree to lose Lagos and its predominantly Yorubapopulation: a deadlock is impending and by the time the Cabinet comes to read\m     this paper will probably have occurred.11* I propose therefore with the consent of my colleagues to break thedeadlock by a decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government who after all retainresponsibility for the good government of Nigeria and are answerable for it tothe House of Commons*   If my colleagues agree I shall state that we havemAm &quot;2&quot; mmm
BVfl decided to excise Lagos from the West and to administer it directly by theGovernor of Nigeria as the Federal capital under a Commissioner until theNigerians themselves agree as to its future.   The result will certainly betrouble and as likely as not some riots in Lagos and the West.   They can ?V/JJprobably but not certainly be dealt with by the five battalions stationed in BJJJJJJJJJJJJBVJJJ Nigeria and the Police*   I fear, however, that we shall be able to add Nigeria. ?VflB^BJ to Malaya, Kenya and Central African Federation as further diet for ourpolitical opponents.   But it is a Nigerian quarrel and to act otherwise wouldB^H be to alienate our friends, probably drive them into secession, to cast aside BVJJJour responsibilities and to leave a dismembered Nigeria to settle its ownBVJJJ differences perhaps with the spear.12. I ask my colleagues to consent to my policy.   It will doubtlessbe represented as imperialistic.   I believe it to be inescapable.Colonial Office, S.W.I 17th August, 1953.bbI -3-
