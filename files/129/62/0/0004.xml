THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)iCRETG. (53) 204 COPY Ni22nd JULY, 1953.CABINETTELEVISING THE OPENING OF parliament note by the Lord Privy Seal and theCommonwealth SecretoryThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 1st July (C.C.(53) 38th Conclusions,Minute 6) gave preliminary consideration to a suggestion made to the LordGreat Chamberlain by Mr. J. D, Tilney, M.P., that facilities should be givenfor televising the Opening of Parliament.   They asked the Lord president to arrange for a memorandum to be submitted to them setting out more fully the considerations which should be taken into account in deciding whether such facilities should be granted.   Before his departure for the United States theLord President asked us to handle this matter on his behalf,2. In the Cabinet&apos;s preliminary discussion little support was expressedfor Mr. Tilney^ suggestion;  and it has since been ascertained that inputting it forward he was not acting on behalf of the B.B.C, or of any bodyof opinion in the House of Commons.   It may well be, however, that thesuggestion will be pressed from other quarters; and the Prime Minister hassent, for the Cabinet!s consideration, the following expression of his view:&quot;&quot;Although I am against televising or broadcasting parlimentary debates, except on special occasions in war time, I see no objectionto doing this for the State Opening of Parliament.   This ceremonyis spectacular and infrequent;  Parliamentary debate is boring,commonplace and perpetual.   There are therefore broad grounds of distinction, &quot;3, The Secretary of the Cabinet has therefore discussed the matter withthe Lord Great Chamberlain and with officials of both Houses of Parliament.In the light of those discussions the attached memorandum has been preparedsetting out the main considerations which the Cabinet would wish to take intoaccount in forming a considered view on this matter,4, On merits we do not approve the idea of The Queen being televiseddelivering the Speech from the Throne.   Apart from the fact that The Queensitting and reading a long screed is not a good episode in technique wheremovement and change is of importance, we think it is undesirable thatThe Queen should be presented to her people doing this.   Well informedpeople know what The Queen&apos;s Speech is and why she delivers it.   Buttelevision is seen by twenty million people who are unacquainted with theniceties of our constitutional practices.   If they see and hear The Queen
wdelivering an exposition of Government policy, they will be apt to identify the Queen with that.   In our opinion this would not be good for the Crown;and this should be our primary consideration,5, If it were decided in spite of these considerations that the Speechfrom the Throne should as a general rule be televised, we think this would bea bad year to start it.   In normal times this might make a reasonablyattractive showing of the Opening of Parliament, the drive and all the rest ofit, particularly on a fine day.   But the Coronation was such an outstandingsuccess on television that a film of the Opening of Parliament this year wouldbe an anticlimax,6, We think it is important to avoid a hurried decision;  and we certainly ought not to take a decision which we might be driven to changeunder pressure.   Before reaching even a provisional decision we think itwould be necessary to have a good deal of consultation.   First of all thereis the House of Lords.   Although The Queen addresses both Houses, the ceremony takes place in the House of Lords, and on this occasion thePeers would be inclined to regard themselves as the senior partners.   Itwould certainly be desirable that the Leader of the House should obtaininformally the opinion of Peers of all three Parties.   We suggest it wouldalso be desirable to get the reaction of the members of our own Party inthe House of Commons.   And certainly before a decision is taken we oughtto have the concurrence of the Opposition.   This is essentially an occasion on which all Parties in Parliament should agree.   When all this has beendone the considered view of the Government would have to be submitted toThe Queen.7. For all these reasons we suggest that we ought to have time to engage in the necessary discussions at leisure, and that we should not attempt to rush a decision before the Opening this November:  there is really no time in the next ten days for everyone concerned to consider allthese matters.H.C,SWINTON21st July, 1953,
memorandum.        Television of the Opening of Parliament might take one of threedifferent forms:-(i)     Television of the whole ceremony.(ii)     Television of the whole ceremony except The Queen&apos;sspeech.(iii)     Television of the proceedings up to the point of entry into the House of Lords Chamber, viz, , the drive to westminster and the procession in the Royal Gallery.2.        The main reason for considering television of the ceremony isthe outstanding success of the television of  the Coronation.    Televisionof the Opening of Parliament would again demonstrate, to people in overseas countries as well as our own, the British talent for pageantry and thestrength and significance of the ancient traditions on which it rests.    It-would also serve to emphasise the constitutional character of the Monarchyand the position of Parliament as the link between the Crown and the people.These considerations themselves, however, prompt the questionwhether, even though it were decided in principle to allow the ceremony tobe televised, it would be timely to do so for the first time in Coronationyear.   Dignified though it is, the Opening of Parliament is not comparable with the Coronation as a spectacle;  not only is it much less colourful,it is also relatively brief;  and on television it might this year seemsomething of an anticlimax.   This risk would be increased if no more thana part of the ceremony were televised.Television, of tne whole ceremony3.        Mr. Tilney, in his original suggestion to the Lord Great Chamberlain,recognised that there might be special objection to televising The Queen&apos;sSpeech.    The Speech is a statement of Government policy, i. e. a politicalstatement.    If this special publicity were given to it, the Opposition couldlogically ask that comparable publicity should be given to their criticisms of it in the Debate on the Address.    Such a request might perhaps be avertedfor a time by a prior agreement with the Opposition - reached on the basis that, although the Government would derive some advantage from thetelevising of the Speech, Governments change and Parties now in opposition would benefit from it when in office.    But it must be recognised that tele-vision of the Opening of Parliament, once allowed, would become an annualevent;  and there is undoubtedly some risk that, as time went on, the tele-vising of The Queen&apos;s Speech would tend to sharpen the demand for broad-casting or televising the ordinary proceedings of Parliament.4.        The televising of The Queen&apos;s Speech may also be thought to be opento the further objection that it might appear to bring The Queen into politics.The procedure by which the Sovereign reads in person a statement of theGovernments policies and intentions is understood and accepted by informedopinion as a Parliamentary convention.    But it is not so familiar to ordinarypeople;  and it might well come as a shock to the average man in the street
to see and hear the Sovereign in person, on television, making statements ofGovernment policy which will often be concerned with matters which are of acute controversy between the political Parties.    There seems to be atleast some risk that, if the Speech were televised, some part of the televisionaudience might be left under the mistaken impression that the Sovereign wasto some extent identified with the policies of the Party in power.Television of the whole ceremony except The Queen&apos;s Speech5.        The considerations outlined in the two preceding paragraphs maylead to the conclusion that the Speech should not itself be televised.    even so, it would be practicable to televise the remainder of the ceremony withinthe Peers&apos; Chamber.    The Speech is, of course, the essence of the ceremony:  no other words are   spoken and the television programme, if ithad to omit the Speech, would reflect only the ceremonial and would fail to bring out the purpose of the occasion.    But the ceremonial itself isimpressive - the Peers and Peeresses in their robes and the members ofthe Diplomatic Corps assembling before the arrival of the Sovereign, andthe procession of dignitaries carrying the Crown and the other emblems ofState.    It is not certain whether it would be technically possible to reproduceon television the spectacular effect of the sudden illumination of the Throneon the arrival of the Sovereign.6.        It would be an innovation to allow television or any form of broad-casting or photography within the Chamber of either House of Parliament.The permission of the Lord Great Chamberlain would be required;  and, inaddition, it would probably be necessary to secure the assent of both Houses.Although the proceedings in the Peers&apos; Chamber on the Opening of Parliamentdo not constitute a meeting ,of the House of Lords, they are a meeting ofParliament - of the Crown, the L,ords and the Commons assembled together.The Lord Great Chamberlain would probably wish to satisfy himself, before any facilities for television within the Chamber were granted, that thiswould be in accord with the views of a majority of the Peers - and it isthought likely that a majority of them would not in fact favour it.    the commons would also be concerned, as they attend the Opening as a corporatebody.    Both Houses might therefore assert their right to be consulted inview of their time-honoured right to exclude strangers from their Chambersand to prohibit publication of their debates.    And, in the House of Commons,it might be thought necessary to table a formal Motion.    (When it wassuggested, in 1942, that electrical recordings might be made of statements on the war situation by the Prime Minister, a formal Motion was tabled -though this was not in the event proceeded with:  Official Report,21st January, 1942, column 382.)7.        Finally, there would be some physical difficulties in installingtelevision cameras in the Peers&apos; Chamber in such a way as to avoid detract-ing from the dignity of the ceremony.    For the television of the Coronationit was possible to do this in the course of the adaptations which had in any event to be made in Westminster Abbey.    But to make similar arrange-ments in the Peers&apos; Chamber would be a costly business.    And the siting of the cameras in the galleries of the Chamber would seriously restrict the accommodation available for distinguished spectators - which already fallsfar short of what is needed to meet our domestic needs and those of visitorsfrom other Commonwealth countries.
XoTelevision of the proceedings outside the Peers&apos; Chamber8. The difficulties discussed in paragraph S above would not arise if facilities for television were restricted to that part of the ceremonywhich takes place outside the peers Chamber, viz, the State drive fromBuckingham Palace to  Westminster and the Procession in the RoyalGallery.   Facilities were given in 1952 for the first time for takingstill photographs of the Procession in the Royal Gallery,   The same facilities could be extended to television if the Lord Great Chamberlain obtained the Queen&apos;s consent.   But, in that event, the newsreel companies couldnot presumably be excluded;  and the Lord Great Chamberlain thinks that there would be considerable physical difficulties in accommodatingtelevision and newsreel cameras in the Gallery.9. It may be doubtful whether those responsible for television would think it worth while to show so restricted a programme.November is not a good month for televising a procession through the streets and The Queen drives in a closed coach moving at a trot.   TheProcession through the Royal Gallery is a short and not uniformly colourfulproceeding.   The members of the public who are admitted to the RoyalGallery to witness the Procession do not wear robes or uniform, and create a somewhat sombre background for the Procession.   This indeed was thesubject of comment when photographs of this part of the ceremony were published in the newspapers in 1952.Procedure10. If Ministers are disposed to favour the grant of any facilities fortelevising any part of the ceremony of the Opening of Parliament within the palace of Westminster, it will be necessary to ascertain whether theLord Great Chamberlain is willing to recommend that the necessarypermission should be given.If it is proposed that facilities should be granted for televisionwithin the Peers&apos; Chamber, it would be expedient to consult with theLeaders of the Labour and Liberal Parties in both Houses and to seek their concurrence in what is proposed.   It will also be necessary to take soundingsin both Houses with a view to ascertaining the views of the general bodyof Members.   And in the House of Commons it may be necesssry that a formal Motion should be passed approving the grant of the facilitiesproposed.
