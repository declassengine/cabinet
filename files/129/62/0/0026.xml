too(THIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC-MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 226 COPY NO. if &quot; &quot;&apos;&quot; i 17th AUGUST, 1953CABINETATOMIC ENERGY organisation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have studied the Waverley Report and I have read rny colleagues&apos;comments on it.    We are all likely to be agreed that it is a valuable survey,bringing out the defects of the present organisation and making very soundrecommendations for the future.2.        The Committee was set up to devise a scheme for transferring atomic energy to a non-Departmental organisation.    They have devised a scheme andwith the essential safeguards which they recommend, particularly in financialand staff matters, I should, for my part, be prepared to accept it if mycolleagues were persuaded that, even with its essential limitations, a non-Departmental organisation is the right solution.    I must, however,   qualify myacceptance with certain important reservations.The &quot;Responsible Minister&quot;3.     ^ The allocation of Ministerial responsibility depends essentially on whether the Minister is to have any primary responsibility for development and production of the atomic components of weapons.    This question is closely connected with the question whether the Aldermaston establishment should goto the corporation with atomic research and the production of fissile materialor remain integrated under the Minister of Supply with the v/hole complex of weapons research,development and production.4.        If Aldermaston went to the corporation and the atomic energy minister was made responsible for weapons research and development, the minister would have to be given a voice in the formulation of weapons policy and production.    He would then have an independent responsibility for an important part, not merely of the programme, but of each individual atomic weapon.Unless the Minister of Supply was also the atomic energy Minister (and theCommittee reject the arrangement) this would mean the creation of a sixthDefence Department, with only a part interest in defence.    I do not thinkthat this would be a workable arrangement.5.        One alternative is that Aldermaston should remain with the Ministryof Supply.    Another is that the atomic energy Minister and the corporation should have no primary responsibility to the Service Departments for weaponswork: but would act in weapons matters only as contractors to the Ministerof Supply.    The Minister of Supply would, in turn, be executing the research,development and production policies evolved in consultation with him by theDefence Departments, though the over-riding directives on the allocation of effort between military and industrial applications would, as the Committeesuggests, come from a Ministerial Committee, which would include the-1-
atomic energy Minister.    While this seems to me to be a perfectly feasiblearrangement, which would present no difficulty in assigning atomic energyeither to a non-Departmental Minister, such as the Lord President of theCouncil or alternatively (which has its attractions) to the Minister of Fuel and power, the retention of the Aldermaston establishment by the Ministry ofSupply appears to me to be the simplest and most satisfactory solution.    If,however, my colleagues are not prepared to agree to this, I would urge most strongly that a final decision on this very complex and important question ofresponsibility for military research, development and production be deferred pending a detailed examination by officials.Finance5.        The financial arrangements proposed by the Committee seem generally satisfactory.    But I must join issue with the suggestion in paragraph 54 of theReport that on security grounds there could be no financial adjustments betweenthe Defence Departments (jointly or severally) and the corporation.    Thiswould leave the allocation to atomic energy within the Defence Budget to besettled merely as a statistical exercise.    It is an essential principle of Govern-ment finance that the user Department should pay for what it receives.    I can-not, at present, see any security ground for departing from this salutaryprinciple in this case.    If the total expenditure on atomic energy is not alreadyknown (and it has been disclosed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) itwill be as soon as the transfer of responsibility is effected.    It is commonknowledge that, at present, much the greater part of such expenditure is formilitary purposes.    The Minister of Supply will, in any case, be recoveringfrom the Service Departments the cost of the non-nuclear elements in theproduction weapons under the bulk adjustment arrangements, and the additionto this of the cost of the nuclear components can, from the security point ofview, make no significant difference.    Expenditure by the corporation on military research and development should also be charged to the Defence Depart-ments, preferably to the Ministry of Supply.    The payments to the corporation for nuclear components and the military research and development undertaken by it would, of course, appear in the published accounts.    But I am notpersuaded that this would convey any information of value not already available if, as would be feasible, only a single figure covering research, development and production is shown.   Any security risk would, of course,, be reduced ifthe corporation were responsible only for providing the fissile material.    Inthis way the user Departments would pay for what they got and their payments would be included in the Defence Budget.Staff Salaries6.        For posts below the top level, the Committee rightly insist that &quot;all reasonable steps must be taken to avoid standards which are widely divergentfrom those in the Civil Service&quot;.    I fully endorse this view: the salaries atpresent paid by other public corporations do not diverge widely from CivilService standards and there is no reason why those paid by an atomic energycorporation should do so.    But the Committee also recommend special arrange-ments &quot;to enable the corporation to compete with industry for men for all itstop level posts&quot;.    This is apparently being interpreted in some quarters to mean for top level posts salaries of the order of  12,000 to  15,000 a year, a range of salaries probably rare even in private enterprise.    If the Committeehad in mind salaries of this order (and they do not say so explicitly) they seemto me to have overlooked the need to preserve relativity among the public boards of which the atomic energy corporation would be only one.    Unless we are to run the risk of upsetting the now well co-ordinated salary structure at the-2-L
AO/atomic energy Minister.    While this seems to me to be a perfectly feasiblearrangement, which would present no difficulty in assigning atomic energyeither to a non-Departmental Minister, such as the Lord President of theCouncil or alternatively (which has its attractions) to the Minister of Fuel and power, the retention of the Aldermaston establishment by the Ministry ofSupply appears to me to be the simplest and most satisfactory solution.

Unless we are to run the risk of upsetting the now well co-ordinated salary structure at the
higher levels in the public corporations, the atomic energy corporation whichwill, for example, not compare in size with its prospective partner, the british electricity Authority, must be kept in line.    I am convinced that it should bepossible to do this and still obtain men of the right calibre for the top levelposts in an atomic energy corporation.Interim Arrangements7.       Assuming that it is decided to transfer atomic energy to a differentMinister and a non-Departmental organisation on an appointed day, steps mustbe taken without much delay to make the preparatory arrangements for planning the new organisation, earmarking the necessary staff and organising the ancillary services.    This will take a considerable time.    Even after a public announcement of the Governments intentions has been made, we can hardlyexpect much to be achieved until a Transfer of Functions1 Order has been made and an Estimate has been passed by Parliament enabling at least a minimumplanning staff to be created.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W.1,7TH AUGUST, 1953.
