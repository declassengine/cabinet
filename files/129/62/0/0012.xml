24th JUDY, 1953.CABINETRE GIQNA L ORGANISA T IONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 28th April last theCabinet considered a memorandum (C. (53) 127)in which I proposed, inter alia, that all regional offices in Cambridge andReading (other than Home Office civil defence offices) should be closed and thework transferred to adjoining regions.   The Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister of Labour expressed unwillingness to close theCambridge and Reading offices of their Departments;  and the Cabinet invited me to reconsider my proposals, but agreed that in the meantime all practicalsteps should be taken to reduce the regional organisation of Departments(C.C.(53) 29th Conclusions, Minute 6).   The Board of Trade and the Ministry ofSupply have prepared plans for the proposed amalgamation of their regional offices throughout the country, and various economies are being effected;but we are not yet in a position to make the general statement about economies in the regional organisation of Government Departments which, five months ago, the Prime Minister promised &quot;before long&quot;.   (Commons Debate,26th February, 1953, col. 2323).COPY NO. ^62.       There are about 25,000 non-industrial civil servants in regional offices,as compared with about 4,000 before the war.   It has been calculated that theshutting down of the regional offices in Cambridge would save 250 staff (23 percent, of the staff in post) and in Reading 160 staff (16 per cent, of the staff in post).3.       I find that it would be very difficult to secure any general closing of regional offices in Cambridge and Reading if the Ministries of Housing andLocal Government and Labour were excluded from the operation.   the efficient operation of the regional system depends on the officers of theprincipal Departments being located in the same place and readily availablefor inter-departmental consultations.   Moreover, common service Departments,like the Ministry of Works and the Central Office of Information, would haveto remain in Cambridge and Reading while Departments of any size remainedthere.   Further, the closing of regional offices is inevitably unpopularamong the staff and the reasons for making exceptions, in the case of theMinistry of Housing and Local Government and of the Ministry of Labour,are not sufficiently distinct to satisfy the staffs of other Departments that theyshould be subjected to a more drastic policy.   While therefore a contractingDepartment such as the Ministry of Food may close its Cambridge regionaloffice as part of the process of contraction, most Departments would be unwilling to take action in advance of a general closing of regional offices in Cambridge and Reading.4.      The majority of Departments are prepared to agree that, while the regional organisation should be retained in the interests of efficientCONFIDENTIALC. (53) 212
administration, the regions centred on Cambridge and Reading are too close to London and too small to share the characteristics of the regions based on,for example, Birmingham or Manchester.   I should therefore like to reiteratemy plea that all the regional offices in Cambridge and Reading should be closed down.   In order to facilitate the operation for those Departments which seedifficulty about the change, I should be prepared to agree that the closing downshould not take place before 1st July, 1954.5.      If the Ministers concerned do not see their way to agree to a generalclosing down of offices in Cambridge and Reading, I see no alternative to anannouncement that the proposed closing down is indefinitely postponed.   In thepresent state of uncertainty Departments are in great difficulty about transfersand the filling of vacancies; and the staffs in Cambridge and Reading are being put to considerable inconvenience in making personal decisions which dependon the length of their stay in these towns, such as the buying or renting of living accommodation.   We ought to take a decision one way or the other in order to end the present state of uncertainty.   I should be sorry if the decision was to retainthese regions, since that would not suggest any great enthusiasm in theGovernment for staff economies.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.23rd July, 1953.
