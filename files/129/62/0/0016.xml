secret.(53) 216 COPY NO. g*28TH JULY, 1953   .CABINETEAST/WEST TRADETRANS-SHIPMENT AND TRANSACTION controls memorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 10th February (C. C. (53) 8th Conclusions, Minute 5)the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself to give instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation to the Paris Group &quot;to indicatethat Her Majestyfs Government were prepared to consider the introduction of transaction controls, provided that all other countries in the Paris Groupintroduce -(i)   trans-shipment controls, and(ii)    controls over the trading activities of their own nationals equivalent to the transaction controls which we would be prepared to apply&quot;.2.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I also instructed officials to study inter-departmentally the implications of transaction controls in thiscountry;  and we undertook to consult our colleagues again when these instructions had been carried out (C. (53) 48).3.       Accordingly I now attach a report prepared by the Security ExportControls Working Party.    In the opinion of the Working Party, objective (i)has only been partly achieved, and objective (ii) has been, or will be, secured in essence.4.        The difficulty is that the Netherlands, Western Germany and Francecannot introduce our form of &quot;trans-shipment control by licensing&quot; without legislation;  and they doubt whether (particularly in France) this would bepossible.    In any case legislation would take a very long time and the issue would be in doubt over the whole of that period.5.        Instead, these three countries have proposed that by administrativeorder they should operate a transit authorisation scheme, details of which aregiven in the attached paper.6.        We shall be required to declare at a meeting of the Paris Group on 5th August whether we will now introduce transaction controls.7.        The transit authorisation scheme falls short of our system of trans-shipment control because our system requires that a trader should apply for atrans-shipment licence, for strategic materials, in the United Kingdom, and heusually does this before the goods leave the country of original shipment.This enables all the circumstances of the transaction to be examined in theUnited Kingdom, i. e. the country of transit.    On the other hand the transit
authorisation scheme transfers the onus of examination to the country of originalshipment and in this case the transit country would only refuse to authorise the trans-shipment if it is stated or known that the goods are destined for the soviet bloc or China.    The authorities would not challenge consignments of strategic goods to other destinations.8.        The Working Party are, however, satisfied that the difference inultimate effect between the two methods should not be very great provided thatcertain countries which are not members of the Paris Group can be persuaded to operate the transit authorisation scheme.    The Working Party consider,therefore, that this scheme is likely to be sufficiently effective to justify theintroduction of transaction controls in the United Kingdom..9.        On purely strategic grounds it is doubtless the case that transactioncontrols will be a useful addition to existing controls on transit trade and thattogether with the transit authorisation scheme in the other countries they shouldprevent many of the existing evasions.    It is legitimate to argue that if we are operating strategic controls we should seek to close all loopholes.10.       On the other hand it is clear that the introduction of transaction controlswill introduce further regimentation of trade and may, because of the likelywidespread indirect effects, mean loss of trade for United Kingdom merchants.We might find ourselves under pressure to introduce the controls in theColonies, a step which we should wish to resist.    It is not particularlysatisfactory that some other countries should introduce different controls whichin the event may well be less effective and less effectively carried out than ourown.11.       Finally, though this is not the moment to relax, neither is it themoment to tighten our controls.    We are meeting the Americans by agreeingnot to make any automatic relaxation of our controls on the conclusion of the truce in Korea;  I think that, equally, they should not expect us to move in theother direction.    The time to offer this additional control will be when we wishto obtain American agreement to a reduction in the strategic lists;  and forthat, we are awaiting a report from officials on East/West Trade for which ministers have already asked.12.       I would recommend, therefore, that we seek at the August meeting ofthe Paris Group to secure deferment of a final decision on this question until we have completed our review of East/West Trade.Board of Trade, S.

ANNEXSECRETEAST/WEST TRADETRANS-SHIPMENT AND TRANSACTION CONTROLSReport by the Security Export ControlsWorking party .     Discussions have for some considerable time been takingplace in the Paris Group with a view to reaching agreement on the closing of certain gaps in the controls on strategic exports to the Soviet Bloc and China.2*     The chief gap arose through merchants (many of themBritish) finding it possible to divert strategic goods, in continental ports v/hilst they were in transit ostensibly toan innocent destination.   This leakage could be stopped,provided the Continental countries concerned., would introduce in their ports &quot;trans-shipment controls&quot; such as we had alreadyintroduced in the United kingdom.   These countries were not,however, prepared to do this unless the United Kingdom, andother countries who impose no financial controls on theirmerchants, agreed to introduce either financial control or a&quot;transaction&quot; control which would prohibit dealings instrategic goods with the Soviet Bloc and China.3.     Accordingly at their meeting on 10th February(C.C.(53)8th Conclusions, Minute 5) the Cabinet invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation in Paris:-(a) to review the possibilities of dealing with the transit problem by tightening-up existingcontrols;(b) to examine the effectiveness of the financial controls imposed by some other countries;(c) to indicate that Her Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared to consider the introduction of transaction controls provided that all othercountries in the Paris Group introduce(i)    trans-shipment controls, and(ii) controls over the trading activities oftheir own nationals equivalent to oursuggested transaction controls.U.     These discussions have now reached a final stage.Participating countries have exchanged information about thescope of their present controlsj the legal powers they possess,or are prepared to seek; and the controls they would introducetowards a uniform scheme to prevent leakages of strategic goods to the Soviet blood and China.
Results of Review(a) Tightening Existing Controls5.     Existing controls have been reviewed in detail and particular attention was given to the import certificate/delivery verification scheme already operated by all the participating countries.   Under this scheme the exporting country calls for a certificate from the declared country ofdestination before licensing strategic goods and it may laterseek a delivery verification that the goods have arrived.This scheme can only be of limited application.   If theproduction of an import certificate were to be required every&apos;time, before any movement of strategic goods could be licensed,much desirable trade would be slowed down or lost altogether.Thus the import certificate scheme has to be operated on a selective basis and it is not practicable to use it for allconsignments of strategic goods.   Measures have however beenagreed to implement this scheme more effectively.(b) Trans-shipment Controls6.      (i)    In addition to the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark,Italy, Japan, Norway and the United States possesslegal powers and already operate trans-shipmentcontrols over sea, land and air traffic on anadequate range of strategic goods.(ii)   Belgium has legal powers but limits operation tocomparatively few items, mainly arms and munitions.Portugal also has legal powers but in generalallows trans-shipment without licence.(iii)    France, Germany and the Netherlands possess powersto introduce a limited measure of trans-shipmentcontrol; but they do not at present stoptrans-shipments except possibly through financial measures where the goods are owned by their ownresidents.There are several differences of detail in the operationof trans-shipment controls by group (i); but in general theother countries referred to in this group control a wider range of strategic goods than the United Kingdom.   All thecountries in groups (i) and (ii) above are prepared toco-operate in applying their trans-shipment controls over a uniform list of goods and destinations, as a minimum.7*     As to group (iii) Prance, Germany and the Netherlandshave emphasised the difficulties they would encounter in introducing trans-shipment control by a system of licensing.Legislation would be required which Prance in particular would find difficult, if not impossible to secure.    In any eventthere would be considerable delay.   The three countries   have,however, declared their ability and willingness to preventdiversions in their countries to the Soviet Bloc and Chinaprovided that they can be satisfied they are acting inaccordance with the wishes of the Government of the exporting country.   For this purpose they have devised a transitauthorisation scheme.
(G)   Transit Authorisation Scheme8.     The transit authorisation scheme which France, Germany andthe Netherlands would be willing to operate is a form of trans-shipment control but the method of operation is different from the trans-shipment licensing of the United Kingdom andother countries.   Under their scheme strategic goods on an agreed list, which originate in Paris Group countries and such countries as will participate, would not be allowed to pass through their territories where the destination was stated,or known, to be the Soviet Bloc or China unless accompaniedby a transit authorisation certificate issued by the country of origin.   Such transit would be legitimate if it complied with the rules of the Paris Group.9.     Unlike our trans-shipment licensing the transitauthorisation scheme transfers the onus of control to the exporting country.    In the case of our system of trans-shipmentlicensing control the procedure is similar to that involved inour export arrangements, i.e. there is publication of a listof goods and destinations and the onus is placed on the traderto obtain the necessary trans-shipment licence.    Licences are normally sought before the goods start on their journey andthus opportunity is provided in the United Kingdom to investigate the facts and insist upon any necessary safeguardsbefore granting a trans-shipment licence.   This safeguardenables us to verify end-use before agreeing to trans-shipment to any destination (except the Commonwealth, excludingHong Kong, and U.S.A.),10.   The transit authorisation scheme on the other hand would operate only where the exporting country had agreed toco-operate in the scheme and would be limited to directtrans-shipments to the Soviet Bloc or China or where it was known that the goods were so destined.    (Und6r the UnitedKingdom trans-shipment scheme we control any case which appearssuspicious no matter what destination may be indicated.)    these differences are to some extent theoretical rather than practical.It will however be difficult to prevent supplies of strategic goods reaching the bloc unless producing countries which arenot members of the Paris Group agre6 to co-operate.   further pressure on these countries, including Switzerland and Sweden,will be necessary for the effective implementation of the transit authorisation scheme.   Nevertheless this scheme hasan incidental advantage that goods on through bills of ladingfrom co-operating countries would come under control.   most countries operating trans-shipment licensing control allowdirect transit on through bills of lading subject to certain conditions.   Our own trans-shipment system does not give suchexemption; but we do not in fact stop goods from a non-co-operating country e.g. Argentina.11.   The transit authorisation scheme has been closelyexamined by all participating countries and it has been -agreed (subject to a reservation by the United Kingdom)that the scheme provides a satisfactory measure of trans-shipment control.   Some other countries share our view thata licensing system in the transit country is preferablej andall the countries already operating a licensing system have said that they will continue it but will issue any necessary;transit authorisations for the use of countries requiringthem.
12.   The scheme would involve the issue of a new document,a Transit Authorisation Certificate, when any goods on the agreed list of strategic items were authorised to be exported to the Soviet Bloc or China through the ports of one of thecountries operating the scheme.   Although any additionalexport document is unwelcome, the cases would be so rare thatit would produce no administrative problem and technicallywe could readily co-operate by issuing the documents if required.(d)   Financial/Transaction Controls operated by other countries13-   In accordance with the Cabinet instruction there has been an examination in Paris of these controls, and the position maybe summarised as follows:-(i)    The United^States of America has already introducedtransaction controls making it illegal for herresidents to take part in the supply of strategic goods to the Soviet Bloc or China except under licence.    Canada does not believe thatobjectionable transactions have been undertaken by her residents and would prefer not to introducetrans-shipment controls    The Canadians havestated that they are prepared to do so only ifthe controls are supported by all other member countries..(ii)   Belgium, Denmark, Prance, Germany, Italy, Japan,the Netherlands and Norway already exercisefinancial controls requiring their residents toobtain legal permission before using any currencyfor buying and selling goods abroad.(iii)   Portugal has financial controls which she isprepared to strengthen if thought to be necessary.Ml,   The transaction controls operated by the United   Statesof America should be at least as effective as those underconsideration in the United Kingdom and Canada.   The financial controls operated by the other countries appear to be effectivesubject to one weakness.   Illegal transactions in foreigncurrencies might be arranged by their residents through privateaccounts held abroad without the facts becoming known to the controlling country.   This difficulty of controlling operationscarried out abroad will also apply to transaction controlsand the effect of financial and transaction controls on the trading activities of merchants in the various member countries should be roughly equivalent.Transaction Controls in the United Kingdom15.   Since the Cabinet decision on 17th February the way inwhich transaction controls might be applied in the UnitedKingdom has been studied by the Departments concerned.   ADraft Order under Defence Regulation 55 has been agreed andis attached at Appendix A.16.   This Order will make it an offence for a person in, ornormally resident in,  the United Kingdom to dispose of specified strategic goods situated outside the United Kingdom:(a) to the Government or other authority of theSoviet Bloc or China;(b) to any person, if h6 has reasonable caus6 tobelieve that the goods will go to theSoviet Bloc or China.-k-
17.   There are a number of objections to an Order of thiskind,  the most important of which are the following:-(i)   There will be a loss of invisible earnings to theUnited Kingdom.   Whilst some of these earnings atpresent arise through transactions of which wecannot approve, there is the danger that through .the loss of opportunity to trade in strategic orsemi-strategic goods United Kingdom merchants maylose other opportunities for innocent trade.   Therewill also be repercussions on the London commoditymarkets.    It has been thought advisable to consult the London Metal Exchange about trade in metals.They do not object to the form of transactioncontrol we propose and are satisfied that it willnot interef ere with their legitimate tradingactivities.(ii)    One effect of the Order will be to make firms inthe United Kingdom which have branches tradingabroad guilty of an offence if any of theirbranches carry through a transaction of the kindprohibited in the Order, even though the transaction is permitted by the Government ofth6 country in which the branch is sited.   TheOrder may as a result be embarrassing to ourrelations with those Governments (including thosein the Commonwealth) which are not in sympathy with our controls.   It may, therefore, be necessaryto find a method of exempting from the provisionsof the Order transactions carried through by individuals, firms or companies trading abroad inaccordance with the wishes of the government concerned.   Article 3 of the Draft Order makes provision for such exemption by means of licensing and this may have to be used in one form or othershould a case arise.   At present it seems from the list of goods affected that such cases in theCommonwealth will not be numerous.(iii)    The Order may be criticised in Parliament and elsewhere as contrary to the present trend, slightas it may be, towards a relaxation of East/Westtension and may even be regarded as another step towards an economic blockade.   It is certainlyregrettable that any further general restrictionson trade with the Soviet Bloc and China should be imposed at the present juncture.   The experienceof the Board of Trade is that the indirect effects of strategic controls are extensive and it is not acomplete answer to the critics to explain that th6Order will merely reinforce existing controls andwill not add new items to the control lists.These indirect effects might be reduced to aminimum by a full explanation of the new order and of the importance of maintaining East/west trade in non-strategic goods.
18.   Prom the purely strategic point of view, transactioncontrol in the United Kingdom should prove a useful reinforcement of our control system,  though we cannot expect it to olose allthe gaps and some merchants may find other possibilities ofevasion.   Nevertheless, we share the view of other participating countries that the introduction of the transit authorisationscheme in Continental ports coupled with the operation of transaction controls in the United Kingdom should prevent alarge proportion of the &quot;illicit&quot; transactions which are nowresulting in the supply of strategic goods to the Soviet Bloc.We have evidence that an appreciable number of these arehandled in sterling by British merchants, the goods beingtrans-shipped in Dutch ports.The Position in Dependent Overseas Territories19.   The extension of transaction controls or of the transitauthorisation scheme to Colonial territories could not beundertaken without full consultation with Colonial Governmentsconcerned.   There is no evidence to suggest that theintroduction of such proposals is necessary to close the gap in our system of strategic controls; and with the exceptionof Italy, none of the Paris Group countries has suggested suchan introduction.   Italy has expressed concern at her controlsbeing by-passed if the dependent territories in theMediterranean do not exercise similar controls and has entereda reservation to her agreement to the scheme making itconditional on similar controls being introduced in theMediterranean dependent territories.    This reservation might at this stage be countered by giving an undertaking to watch the position in the Mediterranean territories carefully and toconsider the introduction of controls in that area should there be any evidence that they are necessary.   The only other colonial territories in which the controls might be ofimportance are the Malayan territories and Hong Kong.   the hong Kong Government have frequently expressed the view that control of transit trade through the Colony would involve agreat deal of administrative work and is not necessary sincestrategic cargoes in any case by-pass Hong Kong.    It isunderstood that at the recent joint intelligence discussions in Washington the Hong Kong Government representative was able to make some progress in convincing the United states representatives that strategic cargoes passing throughHong Kong are in fact negligible.   As regards transactioncontrols, it appears extremely doubtful whether they couldbe made effective in Hong Kong since they would involve theco-operation of Chinese controlled banks and commercialundertakings.20.   The whole question of controls over Malayan trade with china has recently been raised both in Parliament here andin Malayan newspapers in connection with the embargo on exports of rubber to China.   There has been criticism both that the embargo is ineffective and harmful to Malaya andthat the United Kingdom Government has been over-steppingthe terms of the Federation Agreement by attempting to controlMalayan trade under the pretext that it is a matter of foreignaffairs.   The climate of opinion in Malaya is,  therefore,extremely hostile to any further extension of strategic controls over trade and close consultation with the governments will be necessary before any decision is taken to introducetransaction or transit controls in Malaya.
ss21.    It is understood in the Paris Group that the UnitedKingdom do not envisage applying the scheme to dependentoverseas territories but will examine in the light of eventswhether any action in this sense would be practicable or desirable.Time table22.   Discussions are due to be resumed in Paris on 5th Auguston these various proposals for controlling transit trade.The position of the United Kingdom has so far been reserved,and we are at present committed    only to consider theintroduction of transaction controls as part of an acceptablescheme including trans-shipment licensing.    But it appearsthat all other countries will be prepared to take a finaldecision on the transit authorisation scheme at the meetingon 5th August and it is desirable that a statement of UnitedKingdom policy should also be announced at that time.The, JList of goods to be controlled23.   The only other aspect of the problem still unresolved inParis is the list of goods to be controlled.   This is not-expected to cause difficulty and agreement should be reachedduring the meetings beginning on 5th August.    If we decide to introduce transaction controls, it is our intention tocover whatever list of strategic goods on the Munitions List,List I or List II other countries will accept for trans-shipment controls, since the two schemes are complementary.Appendix B contains the list of goods which seems likely tobe accepted by all countries, and this list is acceptable tous for transaction control.   It is restricted to items whichpast experience has shown to be liable to figure in transittrade as well as to be recognisable by control authorities.It includes goods subject to quantitative control as wellas those totally embargoed and there has been no support forour suggestion that a longer list should be operated againstChina as long as the war in Korea lasts.   We may be subject in due course to pressure to extend this original list.Conclusion2h*    The conditions laid down by the Cabinet have not been entirely complied with, because in our&apos; view the transitauthorisation scheme is not an entirely satisfactory   .alternative to trans-shipment licensing.    But the transitauthorisation scheme is apparently as far as the Dutch,Germans and Prench are prepared to go, and it should proveeffective, if, coupled with transaction or financial controls,in closing a large part of the present gap in our strategic controls.25.   It has always been our view that physical controls,i.e. export and trans-shipment licensing, backed by theImport Certificate/Delivery Verification Scheme, operated byall members of the Paris Group, would be adequate to preventthe diversion of strategic goods in transit.   But it has proved impossible to persuade other countries to introduce the necessary trans-shipment controls unless we also introducetransaction controls in the United Kingdom0   If we now refuseto introduce transaction controls these other countries willrefuse to introduce the transit authorisation scheme.    In this event the United Kingdom might well be held responsible for the breakdown of the long negotiations to produce an agreed schemefor tightening controls over transit trade in strategic goods.
The issue for decision is therefore whether the advantages to Western Europe from the&apos; strategic point of view outweigh the economic disadvantages and the difficulties of transactioncontrols in the United Kingdom set out in paragraph 17 above.Reo o mmend a t ions26.   We recommend:-(i)    that our representatives in Paris on 5th Augustshould state that Her Majesty&apos;s Government havenow decided to introduce transaction control inthe United Kingdom on condition that all othermembers of the Paris Group operate equivalentfinancial or transaction controls and eithertrans-shipment licensing or the transitauthorisation scheme;(ii)    that the introduction of the new controls in allparticipating countries should be simultaneous;(iii)    that the list of goods to be covered by ourtransaction control should be no longer thanthe list accepted by all countries fortrans-shipment controls;(iv)    that the introduction of a transaction controlOrder in the United Kingdom should be accompaniedby a full explanation of its purpose and scope;(v)    that we should resist the extension of the control to Colonial territories but should, if necessary,give an undertaking to watch the position,particularly in the Mediterranean territories,and to consider the introduction of controlsthere if experience shows them to be required.
