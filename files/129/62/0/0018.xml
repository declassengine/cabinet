(THIS DOCUMENT IS THESECRETC.(53) 216 COPY NO.28TH JULY, 1953CABINETPROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY formaltality AND GOLD COASTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for, the colonies on 8th July, Mr. Wyatt asked the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons whether he would arrange for responsibility for Malta and the gold coast to be transferred from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth PvelationsOffice.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that this proposal had very recently been put forward by the Prime Minister of Malta;  and might besubmitted later in the year by the Gold Coast Government,    He was not preparedto make any statement at present.2.        Although neither request has yet been made with full formality there is sufficient authority in each for me to submit to my colleagues proposals for aresponse,MALTA3,        My colleagues are aware of the difficulties which arose from theinsistence of Dr. Borg Olivier, the Prime Minister of Malta, that (in the words of a Resolution passed without a division by the Legislative Assembly) he shouldbe &quot;accorded his rightful place alongside the other Prime Ministers of theCommonwealth&quot; in the Coronation festivities.    In the event we accorded thePrime Minister treatment identical with that of the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, but explained that this was done in recognition of Malta&apos;s uniqueposition in having been awarded the George Cross, and was not to be taken as implying a willingness to entertain his constitutional claims.    On the last dayof his visit to London, Dr. Borg Olivier handed to the Minister of State for colonial Affairs a memorandum claiming that the affairs of Malta, as adependency enjoying responsible government, should be transferred from theColonial to the Commonweal5h Relations Office which, he hoped, &quot;would helpbring about a more adequate recognition of Malta&apos;s constitutional status&quot;.Mr. Kopkinson undertook to study the memorandum and to let Dr. Borg Olivierhave any comments we had to make unofficially in the first instance.4.        The demand from Malta was expressly put forward on political and noton practical grounds.    The Maltese, as a European people boasting a civilisationolder than our own, resent their &quot;Colonial&quot; status, more particularly their inclusion in the same constitutional category as the peoples of the african colonies.    Their dependent status is expressed in practical terms in the presentdyarchical constitution under which they enjoy autonomy in internal affairs, butdefence, foreign relations and related matters are reserved to the ImperialGovernment.    Some slight alleviation of the constitutional restrictions on self-government might be contrived, but reservation to Her Majesty&apos;s Government
of control over the broad field of defence interests is imposed by the fact of malta&apos;s situation as a fortress.    Nor is she a sufficiently sizeable territory orqualified financially and economically to be a fully self-government Common-wealth country.    She lacks minerals and is poor in other natural resources, and her whole economy therefore depends, directly or indirectly, on expenditure bythe Services and could be disastrously affected by contraction of defence require-ments in the Mediterranean.    Even at a time of full employment in the dockyardand while large sums are being made available annually by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for reconstruction and repair of war damage, the financial solvencyof her Government is precarious.    Substantial assistance from Her Majesty^Government was required to balance the budget last year.    A table summarising the different forms of financial assistance given to Malta by Her majesty&apos;s government is annexed.    A request for further assistance in the current year was put forward by Dr. Borg Olivier during his recent visit.    It may be assumed that assistance will continue to be required over the next few years, particularlywhen our payments for war damage are exhausted.    The system of parliamentary government might again break down, involving either, as has happened before,reversion to government of &quot;Crown Colony&quot; type or else government by aCommission as tried in Newfoundland.5.        Thus Malta cannot now qualify for acceptance as a full member of theCommonwealth and therefore properly fall within the province of the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations, nor is she likely to do so in the future.Yet retention among the territories for which the Colonial Secretary is responsible is no longer regarded in Malta as tolerable.    Recent eventsrevealed clearly the strong and widespread feeling which exists in the Colonyon the subject of Malta&apos;s status and the sympathy with which it is answered inParliament, Press and public in this country.    Dissatisfaction with their constitutional status is poisoning our relations with a people to whom we owemuch and whose loyalty to the Crown is perhaps as strong now as it has ever been.6.        My suggestion is that responsibility for Maltese affairs should betransferred to the Home Secretary, who has relationships with the channel islands and the Isle of Man similar to those which exist between the colonial secretary and Malta,    So far as the Islands are concerned, the constitutional position is that legislation requires the approval, not of the Home Secretary but of the Privy Council, and the Home Secretary acts vis-a-vis the Islands in his capacity as that member of the Council who is specially charged with the affairs of the Islands.    Malta could likewise be placed under the care of the privy council and the Home Secretary would then take responsibility for Malta inthe way in which he accepts responsibility for the Islands.    The justification fortreating Malta in this way would be that she, being a fortress island in Europe,could logically be detached from the Colonial Empire and treated as one amongthese nearer territories.    Of the other Colonies, only Gibraltar and Cyprus arecomparable.    In neither is there any local demand for a change and no genuinedemand is likely to be made from any responsible quarter.    If ever gibraltar and Cyprus reach a similar stage of development to that attained by Malta, thedevice of bringing them under the umbrella of the Privy Council could be applied,although such a course might well cause difficulties with Spain and Greecerespectively.7.        Transfer to the Home Office would not in itself alter the constitutional status of Malta.    It might not completely satisfy Malta, but it ought at least toremove any existing resentment at being lumped together with the african territories.    There have been suggestions in Malta (for example from theDeader of the Opposition) that her only salvation lies in union with the United
Kingdom.    Such ideas are nebulous and based largely on the view that the maltese should participate in the social services provided in the United Kingdom;but their currency at least suggests that transfer to the Home Office might offerattractions to Maltese opinion.    Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s claim at the Coronation wasthat his treatment should be assimilated to that of the Prime Ministers ofNorthern Ireland or Southern Rhodesia.-8.        By transfer from the Colonial Office, Malta would forgo the benefit ofthe machinery and expert advice we provide to help Colonial territories withtheir financial, development and other problems.    The Home Office has, however,the experience of representing the interests of the Channel Islands and the isle of Man and could, I have no doubt, satisfy Malta&apos;s requirements.9.       As regards finance, there is no doubt that, as I have indicated above,Malta will for years continue to need financial assistance.    At present, as isshown from the Annex to this paper, she receives help under the scope of theColonial Development and Welfare Acts and also grants in aid from moniesvoted by Parliament.    Legislation would be required to provide for periodicalsubsidies from the Exchequer, whether or not Malta remains within the scopeof the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.GOLD COAST10.      In my memorandum C. (53) 154 I informed my colleagues of the likelydevelopments regarding the next stage of constitutional advance in the Gold Coast.The Gold Coast Government published its proposals in a White Paper on 20th june and they have recently been debated in the Colonial Legislature, where they wereendorsed.    We may therefore expect that these proposals will in due course besubmitted formally to Her Majesty&apos;s Government for approval and I shall thenconsult my colleagues.es about the reply to be made to the Gold Coast Government.11.       The proposals debated in the Gold Coast follow fairly closely those whichI anticipated in C. (53) 154, but it appears probable from the &quot;White Paper that two additional requests will be made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.12.      The first of these is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should make adeclaration recognising the existence of a general demand in the Gold Coast for self-government within the Commonwealth, and expressing readiness tointroduce an Act of Independence into the United Kingdom Parliament &quot;as soonas the necessary constitutional and administrative arrangements for independence&quot;in the Gold Coast have been made.    I do not propose to deal with this issue inthis paper.13.       The second additional request is that the affairs of the Gold Coast duringthe final transition stage before independence may be dealt with by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, following the precedent ofSouthern Rhodesia.    Such a change would, in the view of the Gold Coast Govern-ment, be more in consonance with the altered constitutional status of the gold coast envisaged in the proposals in the White Paper.    The precedent ofSouthern Rhodesia is not  one which need, or indeed could be, followed.    Wemust continue to regard the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations for Southern Rhodesia and consequently for the Central african federation as an anomaly.    As in the case of Malta, the Gold Coast&apos;s request for a transfer is made largely for reasons of prestige, and,although it was putforward by Gold Coast Ministers at a very late stage, its importance should not.be under-estimated.    One real difference between Malta and the Gold Coast
is that, whereas the former is unlikely ever to qualify for a state of independence within the Commonwealth which would make it properly the responsibility of theCommonwealth Secretary, the Gold Coast is entitled to look forward before very long to complete self-government.    Nevertheless it would be wrong to anticipate the achievement of this complete self-government by a premature transfer ofresponsibility to the Commonwealth Relations Office, and if and when the requestis formally made I would propose to refuse it.14.       The Gold Coast Government may, I hope, be persuaded that their immediate interests will be better served if they remain under the ColonialOffice until they in fact obtain complete self-government.    It could also be explained to them that the Commonwealth Relations Office is not equipped toprovide the services, such as recruitment of staff and skilled advice in manyfields of economic and social development, which the country will still look toHer Majesty&apos;s Government to help to provide in the final transitional stage.15.       I do not consider that a refusal to agree to the transfer at this stage tothe Commonwealth Relations Office, if the substantial reasons are skilfullyexplained, is likely to prejudice the successful negotiation of the otherconstitutional issues between the Gold Coast and United Kingdom Governments,or to prevent good relations being maintained during the next stage of the GoldCoasfs constitutional progress.    I have already warned the Governor that therequest, if made, is likely to be refused.RECOMMENDATIONS16.       My recommendations are that:-(a) It should be decided in principle now that the requestof both Governments for the transfer of their affairs to the Commonwealth Relations Office be refused.(b) As regards the Gold Coast, the tactics for conveyingthis decision should be reviewed when the gold coast Government have formally presented all their requests for constitutional change.(c) As regards Malta, the decision should be regardedas final, but I should be authorised to inform thePrime Minister of Malta that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared, if this would be acceptable to Malta&apos;s Ministers, to arrange forresponsibility for handling Malta&apos;s affairs to betransferred to the Home Office,O.L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.27TH JULY, 1953.
