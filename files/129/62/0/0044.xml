1^513 DOCUMENT 13THE PROPER&apos;ITY OI:OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 COVER!LlNMENTSECRETC.(53) 244RE.CC AHC:OPY NY NO. L4&quot;4TH SEPTEMBER, 1953CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THEGOLD CGaSTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the proposals of the Gold Coast Government for constitutional change,which I anticipated in my memorandum C. (53) 154 of 13th May, have now been formally submitted by the Governor in a short despatch enclosing the White Paperpublished by the Gold Coast Government in June.52   Some of these proposals must be discussed with the Gold Coast over the next few months but meanwhileI have been asked whether they are acceptable in broad principle to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.2,        With the exceptions mentioned below, the proposals are substantially asexpected.    Acceptance would mean that, short of the exercise of the Governor !sreserved powers, responsibility for internal affairs would be almost wholly inGold Coast hands, while Her Majesty&apos;s Government would retain, through theGovernor, responsibility for external affairs and defence.&apos;3.        The White Paper differs from my forecast of May last in these four(a) It proposes the assignment to an African Minister of responsibilityfor the police &quot;except insofar as the Governor will have a special responsibility in matters affecting internal security and themaintenance of public order&quot;.    The Governor states that theambiguity of this proposal at the time of publication last June wasintentional and that his Prime Minister is fully aware that theposition of the iDolice will have to be stated with precision in thenew constitutional instruments.    As I told my colleagues I shallnot agree to any arrangement that does not reserve to theGovernor overriding control of the police.(b) It proposes the establishment in other countries (such as theU.S.A. and Canada) of offices similar to the one which the gold coast maintains in London (as do also several other colonial governments) to deal with minor day-to-day business and topromote interest in and trade with the territory.    Thisproposal, which might conflict with the Governor&apos;s primary responsibility for external affairs and raise difficulties ofprotocol, will have to be discussed with the other Departmentsconcerned in the United Kingdom before a settlement isreached.x   See paragraph 10 of C. (53) 218 of 27th July.ways:-
(c) It makes the proposal, to the rejection of which my colleagues agreed in principle (C. C. (53) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3)that, before the Gold Coast attained full self-government,responsibility for its affairs should be assigned to theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.(d) It lays great stress on a request, which I reported to theCabinet in paragraph 1Z of C. (53) 218, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should make a declaration expressing readiness,as soon as the necessary constitutional and administrative arrangements for independence have been made, to grant theGold Coast self-government within the Commonwealth.    this request was embodied in the motion for approval of the WhitePajuer moved in the legislature by Dr. Nkrumah.    The actualwording of the motion was that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould introduce an Act of Independence into the UnitedKingdom Parliament delcaring the Gold Coast a sovereignand independent State within the Commonwealth.    It will benoted however that the proposal does not rafise the issue ofthe Gold Coasfs becoming a full and independent member ofthe Commonwealth.    Gold Coast Ministers know that this isnot a matter for the United Kingdom Government alone.4.        Despite certain obvious objections to making any such declaration of future intention, I endorse the Governor&apos;s advice that, to reject the proposal now that it has been made public, would bring about a rapid deterioration of thesituation and would in fact hasten a demand for the immediate grant of independence.    Sinister designs for perpetuating the Colonial &quot;bondage&quot; of theGold Coast would be attributed to Her Majesty&apos;s Government both by WestAfricans and by others from whom the rapid but comparatively smooth advanceof the Gold Coast towards self-government has gained much goodwill for our policy.5.        The substance of such a declaration would not be repugnant to our general policy.    It has been the expressed intention of successive United kingdom governments to help the Colonies to attain self-government within the Common-wealth.    The timing and method of attaining this objective must vary from oneterritory to another;  but the Gold Coast, with no racial problem, considerablenatural wealth and a popular African Government steadily gaining in exj)erienceand prestige, is offering - at least superficially-enough evidence of ability to manage its own affairs to deprive Her Majesty&apos;s Government of any justification for refusing this request.    No timetable is attached to it.6.        I propose therefore if my colleagues agree to authorise the Governor toinform the Gold Coast Cabinet, when he sees fit, that the Secretary of State onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will be prepared,subject to a general agreement on constitutional changes, to make a declaration on the following lines:--&quot;When these changes (i. e. those agreed as the result of discussions on the proposals in the White Paper) have been madethe powers retained by Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be the minimum which they must retain so long as they have any responsibilityfor the Gold Coast.    These changes must therefore be regardedas the last stage before full self-government.    The grant of full self-government within the Commonwealth is a matter forthe United Kingdom Government and Parliament and I can say
&apos;V7that, at the appropriate time, Her Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom will be prepared to take such steps as maybe necessary for that purpose.    Admission to full and independentmembership of the Commonwealth is of course a different question on which all existing members would be consulted. &quot;A declaration on these lines would probably be made public early in 1954 whenthe constitutional changes are introduced.    But the precise timing would be fixedlater as tactics required.7.        The arrangements to be made by the Gold Coast Government for achiev-ing full self-government must include the establishment of a separate and largelyAfricanised public service, and the provision of suitable compensation for anyoversea officers whose careers maybe adversely affected by the changes.    Thefirst steps have already been taken to establish this separate service and mycolleagues will recall that I informed Parliament on 9th July of the proposals for compensating Colonial Service officers which Dr. Nkrumah, with my general approval, had made known in the Gold Coast Assembly.8.        Assuming a satisfactory settlement of the outstanding issues, I proposeto submit new constitutional instruments to the Privy Council early in 1954.This would enable a fresh General Election to be held in about May, 1954, sothat a new Government would take office in the middle of the year.    The Govern&quot;rnent would consist of an all-African Cabinet over which the Prime Miinisterwould normally preside, and which would be advised by a European Economicand Financial Adviser and a European Attorney-General; the single-chamberlegislature would probably consist only of persons chosen by direct electionsthroughout the territory by universal adult suffrage;  the Governor&apos;s presentreserved powers would be retained and, through a Deputy Governor acting as secretary for Defence, he would exercise responsibility for foreign affairs and defence, including overriding responsibility for the police;  and selected AfricanMinisters would be associated as necessary with these reserved subjects through a small Defence Committee under the Chairmanship of the Governor.9.        Much preparatory work must be done in the Gold Coast before freshelections with an extended franchise can be held.    I therefore propose to submit for approval, probably late in October, without prejudice to the detailed discussions which may then still be proceeding, a brief Order-in-Council toenable the Gold Coast Legislature to pass a new Electoral Ordinance.10.       The Gold Coast proposals, far reaching as they are, have been prepared with care by a moderate African Government anxious to avoid any break in relations with the United Kingdom.    They were approved by the Legislaturewithout a division, and they undoubtedly command widespread support throughoutthe territory.    Their rejection would bring to an end settled government byconsent, and forfeit the goodwill towards the United Kingdom and the desire toretain the British connection which are common to all parties in the Gold Coast.I invite my colleagues&apos; agreement that I should approve them now in broadprinciple, and thereafter over the next few months work out a detailed agreement on the lines which I have described.O.L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.3RD SEPTEMBER, 1953.
