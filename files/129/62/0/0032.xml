C.(53) 23215TH AUGUST, 1953CABINETEGYPT:  DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMy colleagues will recollect the proposals which I made before my visit to Washington in July (C. (53) 190).    After my return, fresh instructions were sent to our Delegation in Cairo, based on these proposals, and onsubsequent discussion in Cabinet.2.        Our Delegation have now had four meetings with the Egyptians.    Thefirst two of these were concerned with procedure.    At the third and fourthmeetings our Delegation discussed all the main points with the Egyptians inaccordance with their instructions.    These points are:-Duration of the AgreementTechniciansReactivation of the bases -; : ;-1-In addition, there is a matter which has not yet come up for discussion,namely:-Time limit for withdrawal ofour combatant troopsDuration of Agreement and Technicians3.        My colleagues will recall that I proposed on 23rd July (C. C. (53) 45thConclusions, Minute 3) to try to reach agreement with the Egyptians on thebasis of the formula allowing for an initial period of five years and continuingthereafter until a satisfactory regional defence organisation had come into being (Annex).    Failing that, I recommended an Agreement for ten years with provision for consultation at the end of that period.4.        The Egyptians rejected the first idea completely, saying they couldnot contemplate an &quot;open-ended&quot; Agreement.    As regards a fixed period,they would only consider three years, unless we were prepared to reducethe numbers of technicians below 4,000, in which case they would extend theperiod to four.    That was their limit.-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.....Sp
5.        Our Delegation think, however, that they might still obtain a ten-year Agreement, provided we agree to run down the numbers of techniciansafter an initial period of four and a half years on the following lines:-(i) 4,000 to stay for three years after the with-drawal of combatant troops (i. e. for fourand a half years - see section on withdrawal);(ii)   reduce to 3,000 over the next two years;(iii)   the parties should then consult on how many areto stay for the remaining three and a half years;(failing agreement, the technicians would then be withdrawn, but we should retain the right to inspect our stores and installations).Our Delegation emphasise that they see no hope of securing Egyptian agree-ment to a period of ten years unless we are prepared to offer something onthe lines of (iii) above.6.       Although this is less than we had hoped for, and might in the worstcase involve the withdrawal of all technicians at the end of six and a half years, leaving us the right of inspection only (i. e. Case C), our Delegationadvise that it represents our only hope of getting a ten-year Agreement.7.        Provided our negotiators stick firmly to Case A in all other respects(in particular as regards control of our own technicians and of our property in the base, and retention of staging post rights to which the R.A. F. attach importance as a link with the Far East) I think it is worth having.    We should retain enough technicians to keep the base working during the first four anda half years.    After that we should be able, for at least another two years,to run it either on a reduced basis or at full capacity if enough Egyptians hadby then been trained to replace the thousand British technicians who wouldhave gone.    Our Delegation should try to ensure that the Agreement containsno provision excluding extension beyond ten years.Reactivation of the base8.        Our Delegation put the formula agreed with my colleagues(C. C. (53) 40th Conclusions, Minute 3).    The Egyptians held out strongly against allowing immediate reactivation either in the event of a major war or of an attack on Persia or Turkey.    Our Delegation think that the mostthey will concede is automatic reactivation in the event of an attack on anyArab State, and consultation in other cases.9.        I am sure that we should press for something better than this.    Inthe first place, I think we should try to obtain automatic availability in theevent of an attack on Turkey,    In addition, we might insert a reference tothe United Nations.    A clause to this effect might make it easier to getEgyptian consent to reactivating the base in the event of a major war withRussia,    Finally, we should want to consult with the Egyptians not only inthe event of an attack on Turkey or Persia but also in the event of a threat of such attacks,10,      I suggest that we should instruct our Delegation to put the followingformula to the Egyptians:-
IllIn the event of United Nations action to resist an act of aggression, or in the event of an attack on any Arabcountry by an outside Power, the base area shall be atthe full disposal of the United Kingdom.    An attack on Turkey shall be regarded as an attack on an Arab countryfor the purposes of this Agreement.    In the event of anattack on Persia, or in the event of a threat of an attackon any of the above-mentioned countries, there shall beimmediate consultation between the United Kingdom and egypt.Period for withdrawal of British troops11.       Our Delegation expect some difficulty over the time limit for thewithdrawal of British combatant troops,    I recommend that we should stickto our figure of eighteen months from the date of agreement, which theChiefs of Staff regard as the minimum practicable figure.American interest at Abu Sueir12.       The Americans have an interest in the airfield at Abu Sueir as a strategic bomber base.    It is important that we should know whether they want to retain this, and if so whether they want us to raise the matter withthe Egyptians or propose to do so themselves.    Our efforts to find this outhave so far met with no success and we should therefore take this up at toplevel in Washington.    If American technicians are to be provided, as was contemplated by Mr. Eisenhower, it is at Abu Sueir that they would be themost useful.    This point also should be taken up with the Americans.Conclusions13. Subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, I submit for the considera-tion ofvmy colleagues the following proposals:-(a)   On duration and the numbers of technicians, we should authorise the Delegation to proceed as suggested andto offer a ten-year Agreement on the following lines:-(i)    4,000 to stay for three years after thewithdrawal of combatant troops(i. e. for four and a half years - see section on withdrawal);(ii)   reduce to 3,000 over the next two years;(iii) the parties should then consult on how manyare to. stay for the remaining three anda half years;   (failing agreement, thetechnicians would then be withdrawn,but we should retain the right to inspect our stores and installations);(iv) the technicians would be in uniform.(b)  On reactivation of the base, the Delegation should be instructedto attempt to secure acceptance by the Egyptians of theformula given in paragraph 10 above.
1X0Foreign Office, S, W, 1.14TH AUGUST,  1953.ANNEXFORMULA ON DURATIONAny agreement with Egypt should remain in force until the countriesmembers of the Arab Security Pact are organised (with the assistance andparticipation of other friendly powers) in a manner to ensure their effectivedefence against external aggression.    It should in any case remain in force for an initial period of five years, after which date either party would beentitled to request discussion of its revision on the grounds that the conditionof principle referred to above has been fulfilled.our figure of eighteen months.(d) H. M. Ambassador at Washington should take up thequestion of Abu Sueir as a matter of urgency.14.       I do not pretend to be enthusiastic about proposal (a);  but I am bound to tell my colleagues that it is the confirmed view both of Mr. Hankeyand General Robertson that it represents the only basis on which an agree-ment with the Egyptian Government is possible,S.
