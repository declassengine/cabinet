4TH SEPTEMBER, 1953CABINETBURMESE PROPOSALS FOR A NEW DEFENCE agreement memorandum by the Minister of defence on 3rd January last, the Burmese Government gave 12 months&apos; notice oftheir desire to terminate the Defence Agreement (Command 7240 of 1947) whichwas negotiated as a complement to the Anglo-Burmese Treaty of 1947.    ThisAgreement, which provided inter alia for the establishment of a British ServicesMission and for the supply of war material to the Burmese Forces was valid, inthe first instance, for 3 years from 3&quot;anuary, 1948 and continued thereaftersubject to 12 months&apos; notice on either side.    On 20th July last the BurmeseForeign Minister presented to H. M. Ambassador in Rangoon his governments proposals for a new Defence Agreement (Annex).2.        These proposals have been examined, in the light of advice offered byH. Ml. Ambassador, the Head of the British Services&apos; Mission, and the BritishDefence Co-ordinating Committee (Far East), by Departments concerned and bythe Chiefs of Staff Committee.    In view of the strategic and political factors involved, I consider it important that the Cabinet should examine the issues raised and determine the policy to be adopted.Desirability of continuing to maintain a British Services Mission in Burma3.        The fundamental question for decision is whether it is desirable tocontinue to maintain a British Services Mission in Burma.    The answer to thisquestion will largely govern the conclusions that may be reached on subsequentquestions raised in this paper.4.        From the narrow military point of view the Service Departmentsconsider that there is no significant value in maintaining a Mission in Burma,either in present circumstances or in the event of an outbreak of activehostilities in that part of South East Asia.5.        On the other hand, there are the following important arguments infavour of the retention of the Mission:-(a)  Political.   The withdrawal of the Mission would result in a diminution of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments prestige andpolitical influence in Burma.    Moreover, the BurmeseGovernment may be discouraged, and hence tempted tore-insure with Moscow and Peking, seeing that our with-drawal is likely to be interpreted by friendly Burmese asunwillingness to help Burma to resist Communism.SECRET C A BI N -;.     - . rICbRECORD copy .(53) 245 COPY NO. 0
(b) Military.    The internal stability of Burma is improving,due to the growing efficiency of the Burmese Army underthe Mission&apos;s guidance.    If the Mission is withdrawn, itis unlikely that the Burmese would be willing or able toreplace it by another of comparable status.    The result would be a progressive loss of efficiency, and the insurgents would thereby regain the initiative and perhap seven threaten the security of the present regime, to whichthe only alternatives may well be chaos or Communism.The political and. military consequences elsewhere inSouth East Asia would be serious.(c) Economic.  If no British Mission were at present in Burma,the Burmese would probably place a larger proportion oftheir arms orders elsewhere, notably with the United states who can supply large quantities of arms and aircraft verycheaply.    They have hitherto only supplied these with ourapproval, but if we withdraw the Mission they might wellconsider that they had a free hand.6.        The Chiefs of Staff Committee, whilst agreeing with the argument inparagraph 4 above from the narrow military point of view, accept that the spread of Communism in Burma would have grave strategic implications for ourposition in South East Asia, and that the withdrawal of the Mission might rapidlycontribute to a speedy spread of Communism in the country.    They therefore consider that our Mission should be continued.Functions of the Mission7.        The Burmese proposals are designed to secure the restriction of theMiss ion2 s role solely to that of an instructional unit.8.        At present the Mission carries out a dual role.    On the training side,it helps the Burmese armed forces with detailed training in schools and in units,and assists them in obtaining training facilities outside Burma.    It seems most desirable that the Mission should continue to advise (formally or informally) onthe latter aspect of training the Burmese forces;  this view is endorsed by theChiefs of Staff Committee.9.        So far as arms and warlike stores are concerned, the normal &quot;outsidecustomer&quot; procedure is supplemented in the case of the Burma army by a JointCommittee sitting in Rangoon, on which the Mission represents Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    The Mission representative in effect scrutinizes the Burmeserequirements to ensure that only essential items, which in the Mission&apos;s view the Burmese are able to utilise, are included.    The Burmese very much dislikethis arrangement, and there is good reason to suppose that, if we insist on maintaining it, the Burmese will take their custom to the U.S.A. - a step whichwe strongly wish to avoid if possible for financial as well as purely military reasons.10.       I suggest, therefore, that Burmese requests for arms should in future be submitted in the normal way through their Service attaches in Eondon:  butwe should make it clear to the Burmese that we hope that in their own intereststhey will continue to keep the Mission informed when such demands are made.Status of the Mission11.       At present the Mission is under the command of a separate Headoperating under a Directive issued by me;  it has become the practice for the heads of the three Service elements of the Mission to perform the functions of
/SOService attaches. The Burmese wish to see the Mission become an &quot;instruction-al team&quot; directly subject to Burmese control.IE.       It is the view of the Service Departments and of the Chiefs of staff committee, with which I agree, that we should insist on the maintenance of theMission&apos;s present integrity under a recognised Head (even if, in future, thisappointment is combined with headship of one of the Service elements) whowould continue as at present to control all British personnel and to co-ordinatetheir activities, to be responsible for all official relations with, the Burmese, andto have direct contact with United Kingdom Departments on personnel and related questions.    In no circumstances should we agree to British instructorsbeing directly employed by, or under the control of, the Burmese.    Subject tothese conditions being met, it is proposed that we can accept the functionalseparation of the Mission from the Embassy.    Each Service Department wouldthen have to consider whether there was an eed for it to appoint an attache inRangoon.Staffing of Mission13.       The Service Departments wish to rely exclusively on volunteers forstaffing the Mission.    The Chiefs of Staff Committee agree, suggesting that, ifthere are insufficient volunteers from amongst serving officers and men,retired personnel might be used.14.       It is essential that we should press the Burmese to make the terms ofservice of the Mission sufficiently attractive to ensure an adequate supply of volunteers.    It is for consideration whether, in the event of insufficientvolunteers being available, some measure of compulsory posting should beadopted, if we are to maintain the Mission in adequate strength.Burmese proposals for supply of arms and warlike stores15 .      Burma holds sterling balances and the Treasury would like her to be encouraged to spend them in the United Kingdom and the way made smooth for her to do so.    The Burmese j^proposals, however, go too far.    They would bind usto supplying specified quantities according to a programme set by them.    Thiswould involve granting Burma a priority for supply of arms above that presentlyenjoyed by Commonwealth countries.    I do not think we can accept this position,and I think the farthest that we can go is to propose, in general terms, thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government is anxious to supply 3urma&apos;s needs and would granther every reasonable facility and assistance in procuring military equipment fromthe United Kingdom, according to a programme to be agreed from time to time by mutual consultation between the two Governments.    In order to get the burmese to accept this revised clause, it might be necessary to make it clearinformally that the supply of arms and equipment is likely to be easier than inthe past and that all their essential needs could probably be met.Burmese undertakings16.       Clause 8 of the existing Agreement contains certain provisions, notrepeated in the present Burmese proposals, as to undertakings by the Govern-ment of Burma.    These cover naval visits and air force staging facilities, andthe agreement by Burma not to receive any other Mission from non-Common-.wealth sources concurrently with our own.
17.       The Chiefs of Staff Committee agree in. principle that any new Agree-ment should include provision for similar undertakings by the Government of burma to be repeated - particularly those relating to over-flying and stagingaircraft.    I agree, and also think we should press the Burmese in their own interests not to receive other comparable Missions from outside the Common-wealth, though we should not necessarily make this a condition.    Furthermore,we could hardly object to their employing individual foreign technical advisers to maintain equipment brought, for example, from United States sources.18.       The Agreement on Jurisdictional and Fiscal Immunity for british service Personnel in Burma (Command 7355 of 1948), the renewal of which the burmese have not proposed, will terminate at the same time as the existingDefence Agreement.    The implications of the termination of this agreement are being examined, and it may, in due course, be necessary for me to refer tomy colleagues further on this point.Duration of new Agreement19.       I think the new Agreement should run for 3 years in the first instance,being thereafter subject to 12 months&apos; notice on either side.    As an absoluteminimum, a period of 6 months&apos; notice would be acceptable.Summary20.      I invite the Cabinet to agree that:-(1)  It is necessary for strategic, political and economic reasons,to continue to maintain a British Services Mission in Burma and,subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the burmese, this should be our aim (paragraphs 3 to 6).(2)  The functions of the Mission should in future be primarilyinstructional, though the Burmese should be pressed tomake use of its advice on matters of oversea training forthe Burmese armed forces, and to continue to keep theMission informed about demands for arms and warlike stores (paragraphs 7 to 10).(3)  The functional separation of the Mission from the Embassyshould be accepted, provided that the Burmese agree to aHead of Mission, who should be responsible for its administration and discipline and the efficient carrying outof its duties, with the right of direct communication withthe United Kingdom Departments on personnel and relatedquestions.    It may be necessary to appoint Service attaches to perform functions hitherto undertaken by the Mission (para-graphs 11 and 12).(4)  We must press the Burmese to accept sufficiently attractiveterms of service to enable us to staff the Mission by volunteers,re-employing, if necessary, retired personnel;  although itis for consideration whether, if there are not enough volunteers,including re-employed retired personnel some measure of compulsory posting should be adopted (paragraphs 13 and 14).(5)    The Burmese proposals for a fixed programme of armsinrocurement from Her Majesty&apos;s Government over a periodof years should be replaced by a general provision that HerMajestyTs Government will grant every reasonable facilityin assisting the Burmese to procure equipment from theUnited Kingdom (paragraph 15).
(6)  We should secure Burmese agreement (perhaps in a separateinstrument) to the continued provision of the matters dealtwith under Clause 8 of the existing Agreement (e. g. navaland air facilities, exclusive British Mission, etc.) (para-graphs 16 to 18).(7)  The duration of the new Agreement should be for 3 years (asproposed by the Burmese), but subject to 12 months&apos; notice or,if this cannot be obtained, a minimum of 6 months&apos; notice(paragraph 19).A.Ministry of Defence, S.
