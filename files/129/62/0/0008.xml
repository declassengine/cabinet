IntroductionWe,were appointed by the Prime Minister &quot; To devise a plan for transferring responsibility for atomic energy fromthe Ministry of Supply to a non-departmental Organisation and to work outthe most suitable form for the new Organisation, due regard being paid to any constitutional and financial implications.&quot;2. We have paid visits to the Atomic Energy Establishments at wind scale,Springfields, Risley, Capenhurst, Aldermaston and Harwell. We have also hadfifteen meetings at which we have had written and oral evidence from the Treasury,Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Fuel and Power, Medical Research Council, and(in their personal capacity) from Sir John Cockcroft, Director, Atomic EnergyResearch Establishment (A.E.R.E.), Harwell; from Sir Christopher Hinton, DeputyController, Atomic Energy (Production); and from Sir William Penney, Director,Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (A.W.R.E.). We have also had writtenevidence from the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office and Paymaster-General&apos;s Office; and oral evidence from the Ministry of Defence, the Trade union side of the Ministry of Supply Joint Industrial Council, the Staff Side of the Ministryof Supply Administrative Whitley Council, and (in their personal capacity) fromthe Controller of Atomic Energy, General Sir Frederick Morgan, and from the under-Secretary, Atomic Energy Division, Ministry of Supply, Mr. F. C. How.3. We submitted our interim Report on 9th April. We now submit our main Report.PART I. DESCRIPTIVE4. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Project dates back to April, 1940,when a Committee of scientists was set up under the Air Ministry to report onthe possibilities of producing atomic bombs during the war. In November, 1941,administrative charge was taken over by the Lord President of the Council, whoset up for this purpose a special division of the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research. Up to this stage University research only was being under-taken, but in 1942 contracts were let to a number of industrial firms for prototypework, particularly the manufacture of uranium metal and the gaseous diffusionprocess for the separation of the isotopes of uranium. At the end of 1943, followingour agreement with the United States, a number of leading United Kingdomscientists were transferred to the United States in order to accelerate the productionof atomic bombs in the United States. This, coupled with a transfer to Canadaearlier in that year of scientists working in this field, practically closed down allacademic, as distinct from industrial, research work in the United Kingdom.5. It was decided immediately after the war to revive the United kingdom atomic energy project and to transfer responsibility from the Department of scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply. This decision wasembodied in the Atomic Energy Act, 1946, under which the Minister of Supply nowcontrols the development of atomic energy. The Act gives the Minister wide powers&quot; to produce, use and dispose of atomic energy and to carry out research into any matters connected therewith.&quot;6. The post-war effort was conditioned from the first by two decisions. Thefirst was that of the United States to break off the war-time United Kingdom/United States co-operation except in certain very limited fields. This meant thatthe United Kingdom project had in certain aspects to be re-established from thepoinl where it had left off in 1943. The second decision was that,,in the light ofthe economic circumstances prevailing, research and production should in the mainbe handled by new, specially created Government establishments and not as duringthe war (or as in the United States) by contracts let to industry. This has led to thepresent concentration of atomic techniques in Government hands and has meant that the whole atomic energy effort has been dependent on Civil Serviceorganisation.7. The post-war programme started with the building of a research establish-ment at Harwell in April 1946. The first step in the production of fissile material was not however taken until the 18th July, 1947 when, after consideration of various
alternatives, it was decided to build two air-cooled, plutonium producing piles atWindscale in Cumberland. The first of these piles came into production inFebruary, 1951. In February, 1949 it was decided to undertake the production ofU235 using the gaseous diffusion method developed in this country during the war.First a low separation diffusion plant was built to produce enriched material foruse in the production of plutonium. This plant came into operation in March, 1953.In July, 1951 it was decided to build a high separation diffusion plant for enrichmentof uranium up to high concentrations of U235, suitable for weapons or as.reactor fuel.8. The Controller of Atomic Energy (Production) was at first responsible forthe plants producing fissile material and had no responsibility for Harwell. Withthe creation on 29th March, 1946, of an Atomic Energy Council of which theController was Chairman and the Director of Harwell a member, co-ordinationwith the research side was first attempted. At that time such atomic weaponresearch as was in hand was being done in the Armament Research Department,Ministry of Supply. In July 1948 it was agreed that the Chief Superintendent,Armament Research, should attend the Atomic Energy Council. From this date the Controller had some power of co-ordination of all aspects of atomic energywork research, production and weapons although it was not until December1949 that he was re-named &quot;Controller of Atomic Energy.&quot; In the same month,approval was given for the creation of a Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston,work being commenced in April 1950. In October of that year a separate atomic weapons Organisation known as High Explosives Research (H.E.R.) was detachedfrom the main Armaments Research Division. This code name of H.E.R. was maintained until the purpose of Aldermaston was publicly announced in May 1953,when the Organisation was re-named Atomic Weapons Research Establishment(A.W.R.E.). Seven months before this, the first United Kingdom atomic weaponhad been exploded at Monte Bello.Central Government Organisation9. Under the Labour Government atomic energy policy was settled by aspecial Ministerial Committee dealing specifically with this subject. The present government has had no Ministerial committee; we understand that atomic energymatters have been dealt with ad hoc by the Cabinet or Defence Committee and thatthe Paymaster-General advises the Prime Minister on atomic energy policy and hascertain special responsibilities allotted to him by arrangements made in April 1952.Ministers are advised by an Official Committee on Atomic Energy which includes,under Foreign Office Chairmanship, representatives of the Treasury, Ministry ofDefence, Commonwealth Relations Office, Paymaster-GeneraFs Office and Ministryof Supply. This Committee co-ordinates departmental policy on atomic energyquestions, being principally concerned with issues of diplomatic and foreign policy in particular relations with the United States.10. Weapons policy is considered within the Ministry of Defence. The Chiefsof Staff (C.O.S.) Committee formulates weapons requirements (types and allocation of effort between types). The C.O.S. Committee is for this purpose advised by a working party on the operational uses of atomic weapons which contains repre-sentatives of the three Service Departments and the Director, A.W.R.E. TheDefence Research Policy Committee (D.R.P.C.) of the Ministry of Defence doesnot for historical reasons normally deal with atomic energy matters. It has,however, a sub-committee on the military applications of atomic energy, which includes representatives of the Service Departments, Ministry of Supply and HomeOffice. This committee is at present mainly engaged on formulating service and civil defence requirements for atomic tests.11. Technical and production policy in the atomic project is settled, subjectto ministerial control, by the Atomic Energy Board (previously &quot; Council,&quot; seeparagraph 8), of which the Paymaster-General is Chairman and the Controller of atomic Energy is Vice-Chairman. Members are the Director of Harwell, the deputy Controller of Atomic Energy (Production), the Director, A.W.R.E.,together with the Under-Secretary, Atomic Energy Division, Ministry of Supply,and an Assistant Secretary of that Division. The Atomic Energy Board is advised by a Technical Committee which includes, in addition to five official members,seven outside members drawn from the Universities and from industry.
12. The atomic project has never been given an overall directive. At the start the aim was merely to give the United Kingdom an atomic energy programme and to produce quantities of fissile material which could eventually be used either for weapons or as fuel for power reactors. The first concrete objective inevitablybecame the production of an atomic weapon since it was known from war-timeAmerican experience that an atomic weapon could be produced, whereas thetechnical foundation for the building of an industrial reactor had not yet been laid. Nevertheless, from the beginning experimental work was undertaken on thegeneration of useful heat in reactors. This work bore fruit in June .1952 when theGovernment were able to approve the first civil reactor programme, which included a small natural uranium reactor which would produce some heat capable of conversion to electricity and also a fast neutron breeder reactor. As a result ofa demand by the C.O.S. for an increase in piutonium production, the naturaluranium reactor was increased in size and converted into a plant primarily designed for piutonium production. Nevertheless, the plant, on which work was started at Calder Hall in May 1953, is expected to yield heat capable of generating some30 mW. of electricity. This project therefore raised for the first time the questionof how the production of electricity from atomic energy was to be worked intothe country&apos;s economy. Legally there are two irreconcilable monopolies theMinister of Supply&apos;s monopoly of the development of atomic energy and the monopoly of the British Electricity Authority and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board for the generation of commercial electricity. There are thereforetwo possible solutions, namely, that all electricity produced by atomic energy shouldbe generated and fed into the grid by the atomic energy project; the other, thatall reactors capable of generating electricity should be run by the British electricity authority. In between these extremes there are a number of different solutionsdepending on whether the reactors proposed are committed primarily or secondarilyto the production of military fissile material. The determination of this matterdoes not fall within our terms of reference, although we were consulted on one aspect by the Paymaster-General. The issue has, however, arisen at an opportune moment during our discussions and has had some influence on our recommendations.13. The Government&apos;s policy on the biological aspects of atomic energyhas so far been primarily directed to ensuring that the operations of the projectdo not result in any radiations dangerous to project workers.or to the general public.No legal responsibility for ensuring safety in accordance with the RadioactiveSubstances Act exists, as no &quot; appropriate Minister &quot; has been designated for thepurpose by Order in Council under the Act. The giving of advice to the projecton radiation matters is a responsibility of the Medical Research Council whichworks largely through the Radiobiological Unit at Harwell, which is an integral part of Harwell though it is recruited and paid by the M.R.C. The Ministry ofHealth and the Thames Conservancy Board have been closely associated withthe control of effluent allowed to pass into the Thames and the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries have been concerned with the discharge of effluent intothe sea from wind scale Works.Headquarters Organisation in the Ministry of Supply14. The H.Q. Organisation in the Ministry of Supply is divided betweenthe Controller^ staff and a Secretariat. The Controller of Atomic Energy is responsible for the Research, Production and Weapons Establishments. He reportsdirect to the Paymaster-General or, through the Permanent Secretary, to theMinister of Supply, according to their various responsibilities. The Under -Secretary, Atomic Energy Division, reports to the Permanent Secretary of theMinistry of Supply as Accounting Officer of the Ministry, to the Minister of Supply(through the Permanent Secretary) or to the Paymaster-General, according to the division of functions between them. The Atomic Energy Division deals withadministrative and financial questions as distinct from questions of production and weapons. A special part of this work is concerned with uranium supplies. It is responsible for handling, in accordance with directions given by the Official Com-mittee, all relations with the Combined Development Agency (the Joint Anglo-American Uranium Purchasing Organisation) and with managing the considerableoverseas capital and investment programme which the United Kingdom&apos;s membership of this Agency involves. For this purpose two officers of the ministry are attached to the United States Atomic Energy Commission.15. The Controller^ staff and the Atomic Energy Division are housed together for security purposes within a wire &quot; cage &quot; at St. Giles Court.  Also within the
&quot;cage&quot; are the Controller^ R.A.F. Liaison staff; a part of the EstablishmentsDivision of the Ministry of Supply; a small Patents Branch; and an IntelligenceBranch which is part of the main Government Intelligence Organisation.Atomic Energy Establishments16. The Atomic Energy Establishments employed at 1st January, 1953,14,149* staff composed of 8,639 industrials and 5,510 non-industrials (including129 staff at H.Q.). The Establishments form three groups:  (a) The Research Establishment at Harwell which employs 3,500 staff (1,726industrial and 1,774 non-industrial). The distribution of effortt at Harwell at1st January, 1953, was:  The Radio Chemical Centre, Amersham, which is an outpost of Harwell, is respon-sible for the supply of natural radioactive substances to National Health Serviceinstitutions; it also processes and sells labelled compounds and artificial radio-active substances produced in the piles for research, medical and industrial purposes in the United Kingdom and abroad. It is the one part of the atomic project whichis on a normal commercial footing.(b) The Production Division, whose HQ. comprising the administrative and design staff, is at Risley, near Warrington, Lancashire. The total staff of theproduction Division is 7,7.19 (5,281 industrial and 2,438 non-industrial). TheProduction Establishments are:  (i) Springfields, which extracts uranium from imported concentrates andturns it into metal for the piles or hexafluoride for the diffusion plant.(ii) wind scale.  Here are the two plutonium piles; the chemical separationplant for extracting plutonium from irradiated uranium rods; and theplutonium finishing plant which produces plutonium metal for delivery to the Weapons Establishments,(hi) Calder Works (see paragraph 12 above).(iv) Capenhurst, the gaseous diffusion plant (see paragraph 7 above).(v) Research and Development Laboratories, Culcheth.(c) Weapons Division (Atomic Weapons Research Establishment). The H.Q.of this division is at Aldermaston and there are outstations at Woolwich, WoolwichCommon, Fort Halstead and Shoeburyness. At Woolwich and Fort Halstead,A.W.R.E. is closely intermingled with the Armaments Research establishment ofthe Ministry of Supply. The joint establishments at Woolwich will continue until later this year. At Fort Halstead it must continue until 1955, when the building of Aldermaston is completed.A.W.R.E. is, as its name implies, primarily a research establishment whose maintask is the development of complete explosive fissile trains for atomic weapons,i.e., the design of a fissile material core together with the associated parts of con-conventional high explosive with electronic detonating devices. A.W.R.E. has howevertwo other tasks:  (i) The production of fissile cores for incorporation in production weapons!.The production responsibility is not co-extensive with the researchresponsibility in that it does not cover the production of conventionalhigh explosive parts which are at present being made at the royal ordnance Factory (R.O.F.), Chorley. This work is being transferredto R.O.F., Burghfield which will, apart from a small storage commit-ment, be entirely devoted to work for atomic weapons.* It is to this figure (less H.Q. staff) that &quot; Salaries and Wages at Establishments &quot; (paragraph 18)correspond. If the whole of the Inspectorate and the Risley Contracts Staff (see paras. 19(a) and(b)) are included, the total would be 15,191.j Measured in terms of the &quot; White Paper &quot; staff only i.e., scientists, experimental officers and engineers.I It is important from the point of view of subsequent administrative and financial discussions to realise that a complete atomic weapon never exists until it is assembled for operational purposes.Per cent.Long-term Research ......Applied Research for the A.E.

(ii) A.W.R.E. is at present involved to a small extent in certain work whichdoes not concern the explosive fissile train at all. This work, whichemploys conventional weapon techniques, is concerned with research and development on firing and fuzing mechanisms. Also, although theRoyal Aircraft Establishment (R.A.E.), Farnborough deals with the structural members which hold the fissile train, with the ballistic caseattached thereto, and&apos; with the associated aircraft instrumentation, therehas hitherto been no sharp dividing line between the responsibilities ofR.A.E. and those of A.W.R.E.: A.W.R.E. has been closely concernedwith airfield dropping trials of the ballistic cases and the cost of thesetrials has been charged to the atomic energy vote.The Pre-production unit at Woolwich Common has also been responsible for producing certain parts of the weapon which are not part of the explosiveThe total staff of A.W.R.E. is 2,801 (1,632 industrial and 1,169 non-industrial).The distribution of work (based on the allocation of White Paper staff) has been:  %Theory of atomic explosions       ......      ...      ... 10Fissile materials     .................. 23-JConventional explosives    ............... 11^Weapons development and production......... 8 Trials and instrumentation............... 25Engineering.........   -.........      ... 16Central direction    .................. 5%Weapon development includes the work mentioned at (ii) above. The heavyallocation of effort to trials will be noticed. Conventional explosive trials andcomponent flight tests are held in the United Kingdom but atomic explosion trialshave to take place in Australia. No effort is specifically allocated to long-termresearch.Atomic Energy Expenditure17. The tables below give the estimated capital and current costs of the atomicproject. The figures do not include any expenditure involved in further programmesstill to be approved which may be started before 1956.18. It will be seen that the annual budget, excluding the purchase of uranium,*is expected to rise from some  40 millions in 1953-54 to  51 millions in 1955-56.The total capital investment is likely to double during the three years to March 1956.Estimated Atomic Energy Budget, 1953-54 and 1955-56	1953-54	1955-56	 000	 000Stores and Materials   ......	7,663	8,765Research, Development 	2,156	1,606Industry    ......      ......

The price of the 1952/53allocation of ore to the United Kingdom was about  3 millions. The total current budget istherefore about  43 millions. In the Ministry of Supply estimate for 1953/54, however, the totalincluded for atomic energy (other than items mentioned in Note 2) is  47 -1 millions. The difference is accounted for mainly by investment in uranium production abroad.f Nothing is included in respect of Ministry of Supply common services except housing andhostels which is readily identifiable. The figure for salaries and wages does not include any H.Q.salaries and other expenses.% The breakdown of the Grand Total for 1953/54 in respect of the three establishments is: Harwell 7-6 millions; Production Division  22-0 millions; A.W.R.E.  10-3 millions.

The Atomic Energy H.Q. in the Ministry of Supply and the atomic energy Establishments are not self-contained; they depend upon a wide range of common services provided by other Ministry of Supply branches which worknot only for the atomic energy establishments, but for all other parts of theMinistry of Supply as well:  (a) The atomic energy establishments make use of the Armaments Inspectorate,the Electrical and Mechanical Inspectorate and the Chemical Inspec-torate, for which a special division has been set up whose members workwhole time on the atomic energy project. The total whole timeinspectorate staff is 988.(b) The main bulk of the atomic energy contracts work carried out by the contracts Division is for the Production Division, most of this being done by an outpost at Risley (staff of 54). The branch is nominallyunder Ministry of Supply HQ. but is in fact a part of the ProductionOrganisation. Some questions are, however, referred to the ContractsDivision at H.Q., which also deals with all contracts work for Harwelland A.W.R.E.(c) The General and Labour Division of the Ministry of Supply is responsiblefor broad questions of policy on wages and also for dealings with theJoint Industrial Council and negotiations with national unions.Management of local industrial labour is, however, the responsibilityof the Establishments themselves.(d) The General and Labour Division is also responsible for housing, hostelsand canteens.(e) The Establishment Division does all the establishment and security workwhich is not done by the special establishment branch in the &quot; cage.&quot;(/) Transport is provided partly by the Ministry of Supply H.Q. and partly by the Ministry of Works.(g) The Ministry of Supply Finance Division is responsible for central finance and accounting.(h) Aircraft for flight tests are provided by the Controller of Supplies (Air).(/) Assistance with the placing of orders is given by the Engineering IndustriesDivision, the Machine Tools Division and also by the Electronic Pro-duction Capacity Committee, whose biggest users are Harwell andA.W.R.E.(;&apos;) The Royal Ordnance Factories provide a variety of services, the principal^        being the manufacture of all H.E. components of the weapon.   as mentioned above, however, this work is now being taken over by R.O.F.,Burghfield.(k) R.A.E. is responsible for providing the weapon case see 16 (c) (ii) above.(/) Among the miscellaneous services provided by the Ministry of Supply H.Q.are those relating to equipment and storage; legal arrangements; lands;public relations; office accommodation; and overseas travel.Services outside the Ministry of Supply20. (a) The Ministry of Works are responsible for new building work and forsome of the maintenance in all the atomic energy establishments. TheMinistry of Works employ about 950 people in the professional andsupervisory grades on this.* All figures on first cost basis without depreciation. No allowance made for value of existing government assets taken over.
(b) Responsibility for survey work on uranium and thorium rests with a smallbranch (of about 15)&apos; of the Geological Survey. Field work is.carriedout through the Colonial Geological Survey, mining companies and private prospectors, to whom the United Kingdom Geological Surveygives advice and assistance.(c) A branch of the Chemical Research Laboratory (staff 35), situated atTeddington, undertakes research into the treatment of dressed ores (inconjunction with the ore-dressing laboratory at Harwell) required tomake them suitable for use at Springfields.id) The project has the services of two officers of the United Kingdom ScientificMission in Washington (D.S.I.R.).PART II. WHAT SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED?Introduction21. Our terms of reference call on us to devise a &quot; plan for the transfer ofresponsibility for atomic energy from the Ministry of Supply to a non-departmentaltype of organisation.&quot; We, are thus not required to examine the reasons whichhave led the Government to decide that such a transfer is desirable. We have assumed, however, that the main reason is that in the Governments view a CivilService type of organisation is not suited to carrying on a large pioneering industrialundertaking; and that such an undertaking ought to have the maximum practicablefreedom and scope for initiative.22. A &quot; non-departmental&quot; type of organisation could of course cover manykinds of body. New scientific and economic needs, to whose handling a standardCivil Service administration could not readily be adapted, have in recent yearscalled into existence a wide variety of executive agencies under the Crown. Webecame, however, at an early stage, convinced that none of the Councils or Com-missions, which now carry on so much semi-Government business, proffers a pattern suitable to the task to which our attention has been directed. In our view there is no alternative to the creation of a statutory Corporation with an executive board similar to, although, as will be seen, differing in certain respects from, thatusual in the other nationalised industries. We therefore refer throughout our report to the body which is to be created as &quot; The Corporation.&quot;A.W.R.E.23. The first question which we had to pose in our enquiry was &quot; What isit for which responsibility should be transferred to a Corporation? &quot; Most ofthe problems raised by this question are matters of detail, but we found that therewas one major issue calling for decision. In view of our terms of reference, which make no distinction between one part of the A.E. Organisation and another, weoriginally supposed that it was the Governments intention that at least all thoseestablishments directly controlled by the A.E. Board should be transferred. Wediscovered, however, that it was still considered to be a matter of controversywhether the Weapons Organisation (A.W.R.E.) should be transferred or whetherit should remain in the Ministry of Supply.24. Evidence was given to us by the Ministry of Supply, which was supportedby the Treasury, that A.W.R.E. should remain a Ministry of Supply establishment.The Ministry of Defence did not regard themselves as directly concerned either withthe precise form of the Corporation or whether the atomic weapon establishmentswere in the Corporation or the Ministry of Supply. Their concern was that theyshould be in a position to exercise general control of the work done by these estab-lishments; in particular, they would not wish any change in organisation to slowdown weapons work or to make it impossible fully to satisfy the requirements of security. The reasons advanced by the Ministry of Supply for their view may besummarised as follows:  (i) Political Considerations and Ministerial Responsibility(a) The Government ought to keep close control over &quot;weapons of massdestruction.&quot;(b) If A.W.R.E. were transferred to the Corporation, the Government wouldhave to keep a tighter grip over the Corporation than would otherwise be necessary.
(c) The Ies3 responsibility the Corporation is given for weapons, the easierit would be to present the case for transfer.(d) The Minister of Supply would not be able to ensure that military work was not neglected by the Corporation.(ii) SecurityIt would be easier for the Government to impose the necessary secrecy inweapons work than it would be for the Corporation, which would be mainlyengaged on less secret work.(hi) The Weapons System: Design and Production considerartions the Ministry of Supply are responsible for nearly all fields of weapon research,development and production, other than those exclusively for the Navy. they ought not to be cut off from a field of weapon development of rapidly growingimportance. If they were there would be no one who could put up a uniformview to the Defence Committee on weapons policy or who could see as a wholea development problem which involved both atomic and other techniques. It is all very well to say that the Ministry of Defence and Chiefs of Staff could state their requirements to the Corporation, but to state a requirement one needs to beable to estimate the possibilities. This is the, value of the Ministry of Supply:they combine the functions of advising on policy and then, when policy is settled,of executing it.(iv) Administrative Considerations(a) The difficulties confronting scientists if A.W.R.E. were separate from theCorporation would be less than the corresponding difficulties ofadministrators if A.W.R.E. were removed from the Ministry of Supply.(b) The allocation of scientific effort in accordance with Government directivesas between the military and civil applications would be better achieved if the two sides were under different management.(c) Finally, it was suggested that if it appeared eventually that a mistake hadbeen made in leaving A.W.R.E. in the Ministry, it would be easier totransfer it to the Corporation than to bring it back to the Ministryof Supply if it had once been separated.25. We have given close attention to these submissions and have discussedthem at length with the officials concerned. We have as a result reached the viewthat it would be quite wrong to try to split the atomic project into two parts andto set up a specialist organisation without responsibility for the military aspects which will long continue a major, though not perhaps in the future a dominant,part of the entire United Kingdom project. It is in our view desirable that thereshould be more and not less cohesion in the atomic project. Separation of thecivil and military aspects would we think be wasteful&apos;in man-power and effort.Further, since the optimum conditions for the generation of power and production\)f fissile material are not the same, the Corporation would, if it had no directweapons responsibility, inevitably tend to give priority to the power requirements.This would lead to continuous disputes which might be disastrous to the military effort.26. Our observations on the specific arguments advanced on behalf of retaining A.W.R.E. in the Ministry of Supply are as follows:  (i) PoliticalThe political arguments in favour of maintaining close Government controlover this peculiarly important weapon: we are not perhaps called upon within our terms of reference to consider the political aspects which should weigh withthe Government in presenting their case but we doubt whether there is reallymuch substance in the points made. There is little distinction between control ofthe working of fissile material into its final shape for insertion in the weapon andcontrol over the previous.stages of production of the material. Close government control must in any case be retained in respect of the policy to be carried out bythe Organisation as a whole, and as public funds are involved Ministers must besatisfied that the Corporation is not neglecting any part of its work, either military or civil; moreover decisions as to the type and numbers of weapon parts whichare to be produced will be reserved entirely to the Government and not delegated to the Corporation.
(ii) Security -While the average level of information in A.W.R.E. is doubtless of a moresecret nature than that in the production and research divisions, a great deal ofthe work of these divisions itself will in present circumstances remain &quot; top secret&quot;for some time and the Corporation will require throughout all its branches a highly efficient security organisation. Any suggestion that the Corporation will need to be less security conscious than the Ministry of Supply must be firmlyresisted.(hi) Weapons systemAdmittedly A.W.R.E. has linkages not only with nuclear energy but with manyconventional weapons establishments and the proposed transfer of A.W.R.E. mightcomplicate to some extent relations with these establishments. But the linkages withnuclear energy are far more important and intricate. Co-ordination with the conventional weapons establishment can be achieved without much difficulty bynormal administrative methods and so far as the Ministry of Supply are concernedthis is a problem which would have to be faced even if A.W.R.E. were nottransferred.27. A.W.R.E. does not in any case produce a complete weapon: only a nuclear device. We suppose that the Chiefs of Staff would after discussion ofpossibilities with representatives of the Corporation indicate a requirement fora certain weapon with a certain power. These discussions would not be affected bythe fact that the scientists concerned were employees of the Corporation and notofficials of the Ministry of Supply. The CCS. or Service Department requirement,in so far as it related to the nuclear device, would be put to the Corporation atthe same time as the weapon requirement as a whole was stated to the Ministryof Supply. The Corporation and the Ministry of Supply would then separatelyand jointly consider how the requirement would be met. The Ministry of Supply,having responsibility only for the &quot; conventional&quot; components, would not be concerned with the working of the nuclear device nor with how the fissile material was used or how it was detonated. They would only need to know that it had a given power, physical dimensions, weight, acceleration, tolerance and that it requiredcertain linkages with the rest of the weapon. Given these facts which will ofcourse be themselves governed by the nature of the rest of the weapon, the Ministryof Supply will proceed with their part of the work.(iv) Administrative considerationsWe did not find these arguments very substantial. The military effort is, as wehave said, dependent on the industrial and cannot be satisfactorily separated from it.28. We have therefore concluded on all counts that A.W.R.E. ought to betransferred to the Corporation. This recommendation covers the whole ofA.W.R.E.&apos;s research work on the complete explosive fissile train. We found allwitnesses, irrespective of their views as to whether A.W.R.E. should be transferredor not, agreed that there can be no question of splitting A.W.R.E.&apos;s researchresponsibility between work on the fissile core itself and work on the other partsof the explosive fissile train. It also means that the Corporation should beresponsible for the production of fissile weapon cores (at present carried out atA.W.R.E. see paragraph 16 (c)).29. We do not, however, recommend that the whole of the work at presentdone by A.W.R.E. should continue to be done by it. As explained in para-graph 16 (c), A.W.R.E. has acquired somewhat by accident certain work on con-conventional weapon parts, e.g., fuses. Also, although it is accepted that in theoryR.A.E. is responsible for the ballistic cases, and for the associated ballistic trials,it appears (see paragraph 16 (c)) that A.W.R.E. has come to play a leading partin these. We recommend, therefore, that in principle the responsibility for all partsof any atomic weapon outside the explosive fissile train should remain with theMinistry of Supply. This division should not be carried to the point of affectingthe transfer of the whole of Aldermaston to the Corporation. It may, however^affect part of the work now being carried on at Fort Halstead and Woolwich whichwould otherwise have been moved eventually to Aidermaston; and it may benecessary to consider separately whether the Pre-Production Unit at WoolwichCommon should not remain with the Ministry of Supply; and where responsibilityfor the firing circuit should rest.
R.O.F., Burghfield30. As explained in paragraph 16 (c), A.W.R.E. is not responsible for theproduction of the conventional high explosive element of the explosive fissile train.It was suggested to us in a note by the Paymaster-GeneraFs Office that it would be convenient if the Corporation had its own facilities for the shaping of high explosiveand that there was a good case for transferring the R.O.F., Burghfield, to theCorporation. This would make it independent of the R.O.Fs. and bring its pro-duction commitment up to the point to which its research commitment extends.This contention was not accepted by the Ministry of Supply, whose witnesses urgedthat, whether or not A.W.R.E. was transferred to the Corporation, Burghfieldshould remain with the Ministry of Supply. As it is near to Aldermaston it wouldbe easy for those working on production and development to remain in close touchwith each other. In our view, any tendency to carry the responsibility of theCorporation into fields not strictly connected with nuclear energy problems shouldbe resisted. The work to&quot; be done at Burghfield, while calling for closer tolerancesthan is usual in conventional high explosive work, is of a conventional character.We therefore recommend that Burghfield should remain with the Ministry of Supply.Uranium and Thorium31. A considerable part of the work of the Atomic Energy Secretariat in theMinistry of Supply (see paragraph 14) is devoted to the procurement of uraniumand thorium. There are reasons to suppose that a much greater effort in uraniumprocurement may be required in the future and that the present arrangementsfor that purpose may have to be reshaped. An adequate supply of uranium andthorium is essential to the future of the project and considerable effort may haveto be devoted to this. The work, however, which extends into the field of geologyand mining as well as procurement effort, is not directly connected with the carry-ing on of an atomic project in this country and the acquisition of uranium andthorium outside the United Kingdom raises questions of a diplomatic, colonial and foreign exchange character. We do not therefore think that this should be primarily the business of the Corporation: it should, in our view, remain a direct-responsibility of the Government and it should be the task of the designatedMinister (see paragraph 35) to establish a vigorous organisation for this purpose.Intelligence32. We do not consider it appropriate that the Atomic Energy intelligence organisation should be transferred to the Corporation. While the corporation would have to carry out certain work on behalf of the Organisation, this shoulditself continue to be a direct Government responsibility.Common Services33. As explained in paragraph .19, the atomic energy project is at presentdependent upon a wide range of common services provided by Divisions of theMinistry of Supply for those and other establishments. It would be necessary forthe Corporation to be a viable entity and for this purpose it must have its ownancillary services covering the range of activities set out in paragraph 19 (a)-(g), (I)and possibly (/). This problem will have to be tackled well before the vesting dateof the Corporation and forms one of the main tasks to be undertaken in the interim period (see paragraph 86).34. This recommendation about the Ministry of Supply common services doesnot apply to the building services provided for the Atomic Energy Establishmentsby the Ministry of Works. A decision whether or not to use the Ministry of Worksas an agent should be left to the Corporation when established. It is conceivable that the Corporation would decide that it wishes to go on using the Ministry ofWorks as an agent. Whether or not this proves to be the case, it would be undesir-able to have to build up a works department in the project in advance of the vesting date, thus adding to the many problems which would have to be faced in thatperiod. We should perhaps place it on record that we understand that it is the viewof the Ministry of Works that the Corporation would have to choose betweenrelying wholly on that Ministry for building services or dispensing with the servicesof the Ministry entirely.
PART III.-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONDesignated Minister35. It is clear that it will be necessary to designate a Minister responsible toParliament for the monies voted for the Corporation and for the policy directionsgiven to the Corporation. It is, therefore, a major question to decide who thisMinister should be. The choice lies between the Minister of Supply, as at present,the Minister of Fuel and Power, the Minister of Defence, the holder of one of thesinecure offices, or a special Minister for atomic energy. It is clear that it wouldbe quite wrong to add this specific responsibility to the many general responsibilities which the Prime Minister has.36. Our approach to this problem has been that the main task of the designated Minister will be to ensure the well-being and efficiency of the Corpora-tion as a whole and to keep continually under review the balance between the useof atomic energy for defence, for power and, to an increasing extent, in the biologicalapplications. In order to do this it is in our view essential that he should have nodepartmental bias towards either weapons or power.37. This view rules out the Minister of Defence and the Minister of supply on the one hand, and the Minister of Fuel and Power on the other; it narrows the choice to the holder of one of the sinecure offices or to a special Minister for atomic energy. We found, however, that this analysis was not accepted by the treasury or by the Ministry of Supply. Neither of these argued for the selection of theMinistry of Defence on the ground, we understand, that this was a co-ordinatingMinistry only which is not adapted to the undertaking of direct administrativeresponsibilities. Both the Treasury and the Ministry of Supply, however, held thatthe designated Minister should be the Minister of Supply. This argument was directed to the suggested transfer of A.W.R.E. to the Corporation: we gathered that had we proposed to recommend that A.W.R.E. should be retained in theMinistry of Supply, this view would not have been urged so strongly.38. What the Treasury and the Ministry of Supply disliked was the introduc-tion of a new Minister into the field of weapons policy. They argued that ifA.W.R.E. was part of the Corporation, then the designated Minister must have aweapons responsibility and the result would be to create a sixth Defence Depait-ment having a part interest only in defence. The Minister would become anotherclaimant on the total resources available for defence research development and production. Hitherto, it was argued, there had been little difficulty in adjudicatingon competing claims in these fields; but as the defence budget was now subjectto an overall maximum which was likely soon to include atomic energy, an increaseof expenditure on atomic weapons would mean a reduction in the amount to be spent on conventional weapons. The designated Minister was bound to become thechampion of expenditure on atomic weapons and his championship would lead himto argue for a reduction in the allocation of resources to the Ministry of Supply.It would be much better if any conflict of this nature were resolved within theMinistry of Supply.39. We have not been able to accept these arguments. They appear to us toattribute to the Ministry of Supply a role in the formulation of overall weaponspolicy which belongs to the Ministry of Defence as the department specially created for the co-ordination of all aspects of the military effort including weapons policy.*They appear also to overlook that it has in fact been the Ministry of Defence whichhave undertaken the integration of atomic weapons with the general weaponsprogramme. We do not consider that the introduction of a Minister other thanthe Minister of Supply will impede in any way the execution by the Ministry ofDefence of this task; nor were any representations to this effect made to us by theMinistry of Defence.40. Moreover, we see no reason why the designated Minister should appearas a defence Minister competing for a share of the available defence resources. Onthe military side he would only say that if a particular addition to the current programme was desired it would have certain consequences, i.e., a need for anincrease in the total budget of the Corporation or a switch over from the civil side.He would normally regard himself as limited to ensuring that the Corporation^point of view was given full consideration before a decision was reached; only if* Central Organisation of Defence, 1946.  Cmd. 6923, Paragraphs 26 and 32.
seriously worried about the balance between civil and military effort in theCorporation would he intervene in a discussion about the allocation of defenceresources. He could not, of course, be excluded from making representations, butif there were a serious conflict this ought to be settled by Ministers collectively:the balance has to be struck in some forum, and there seems no ground for arguing that it ought to be settled within one Ministry where full weight might not be givento the civil applications. One must recognise that, with the advent of atomic energy,defence research and development can no longer be considered in isolation: what happens now affects the civil uses of atomic energy. It would, in our view, be farless difficult for the existing Ministers concerned with defence if the designatedMinister had a definite responsibility for A.W.R.E. than if he were solely interestedin the civil side and was continually pressing its claims regardless of the defenceinterest which would happen if A.W.R.E. were left in the Ministry of Supply andthe designated Minister had no responsibility for it.41. For these reasons the choice must in our view fall on the holder of oneof the sinecure officers or on a special Minister for atomic energy. We do not recommend the latter. The extent of the Ministers responsibilities would not justifythe creation of a special Ministerial office and we consider that the issues which do arise will be such as should engage the attention of a senior Minister and not of a relatively junior one, as an ad hoc Minister of atomic energy would necessarily be. We therefore recommend that the Minister responsible to Parliament for theCorporation should be one of the existing Ministers of high Cabinet rank, whohas no departmental responsibilities which encroach upon the field of atomic energy.The most suitable Minister seems to be the Lord President of the Council. We donot, however, make a specific recommendation that he should be designated since there might be advantage in leaving it open to the Government of the day toconsider which of the holders of the sinecure offices should be charged with this special and of necessity rather personal responsibility.Ministerial Committee42. The balance in the affairs of the Corporation between weapons, powerand the biological applications will be governed by the collective decisions ofMinisters and may be subject to modification from time to time. This is a strong arguement for the establishment of a Ministerial Committee which should have as members, in particular, the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,Lord President, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the ministers of Defence, Fuel and Power, and Supply. The designated Minister should be theChairman of the Committee.Staff of the Parent Department43. The designated Minister will require a small group of officials to assist them. We stress that this should be a small group since they will be concernedwith broad policy only and should not become competitive with the corporation or try to encroach on its proper functions. These officials should constitute a smalldepartment responsible solely to him and should not owe allegiance to any of theDepartments having a particular interest in the applications of atomic energy. Wehave given some consideration, in consultation with the Treasury, to the status ofthe head of this office. We agree that an officer of Permanent Secretary statusmight be under-employed if he were used solely on atomic energy work and thathe might well have other responsibilities not connected with atomic energy.Whether this will be possible may depend on whether the designated Minister hasany other functions on which the officer could be engaged. We agree with theTreasury that it would be easier to find additional employment for a deputy secretary and that it would be difficult to go back if a Permanent Secretary were appointed and this were found to be an unsatisfactory or wasteful arrangement.We therefore recommend that it would be better to start off by making this officera Deputy Secretary. He would have to be carefully selected in view of what wesay in the succeeding paragraph.Official Committee44. An Official Committee representative of all the departments concernedwith atomic energy will be required as at present. It would be appropriate thatthe official head of the designated Minister^ department should take the chair of
this Committee. The constitution of the Committee should be such as to permit the attendance of Permanent Secretaries but to allow them to send subsitutes if desired. In our view the Corporation should be directly represented on thisCommittee.45. One of the main tasks of the Official Committee will be, as at present,to keep a constant watch on the international and Commonwealth aspects of theUnited Kingdom atomic energy effort. In a memorandum forwarded to us bythe Foreign Office it was submitted that:  (a) The Corporation should on all matters of external policy be obliged to consult an Official Committee on which the Foreign Office would berepresented; and(b) The channel of communication for agreed decisions on matters of policy should be through the Foreign Office and Her Majestys&apos; Mission in thecapital concerned to the foreign Government or authority.A similar memorandum by the Commonwealth Relations Office urged that all policymatters concerning Commonwealth countries should be channelled through theOfficial Committee. Both the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth relations office agree that where valuable scientific contacts exist or in routine matters, itwould not be necessary to channel all contacts through the Official Committee; andthe Commonwealth Relations Office were anxious that the closest possiblecontacts at all levels should be developed between the Corporation and theauthorities concerned in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Wefully agree with these suggestions and recommend that a suitable directive should begiven to the Corporation at the outset.46. Weapons matters will, as at present, be excluded from the purview of theOfficial Committee. We.fully agree with the submission of the Ministry of defence that the Ministry must remain generally responsible after the Corporation is setup for the allocation of effort for defence purposes between atomic energy andconventional armaments and for the distribution of effort between the development and production of atomic weapons; and that in particular:   .(a) it should be for the Ministry to specify the number, type and performance of weapons, and(b) programme of research and development on atomic weapons should bebrought within the Defence Research Policy Committee&apos;s purview.It is indeed one of the less satisfactory features of the present situation that themain committee charged with giving the Government overall advice on defence research policy should not deal with atomic weapons. We expect that as soon as this matter has been put right, suitable arrangements will be made to invite repre-sentatives of the Corporation to attend the Defence Research Policy committee as necessary.Residual responsibility of the Ministry of Supply47. The Ministry of Supply will naturally continue to be responsible for all those components of atomic weapons in respect of which research, development orproduction responsibility is not transferred to the Corporation (see para-graphs 28-30).48. We are ourselves inclined to agree with the view of the Ministry ofDefence that the organisation for atomic weapons should in these circumstances be brought closely into line with that for conventional weapons. That is to say the research development and production authority for a complete bomb should bethe Controller of Supplies (Air) (CS (A)); for a mine or shell the Controller ofSupplies (Munition) (CS (M)); for guided weapon the Controller, Guided weapons and Electronics (CGWE).49. On the other hand the Ministry of Supply represented to us that theywould need a Controller of Atomic Weapons who would be responsible for pro-gramming the Ministry of Supply and Corporation components and that thisController would deal with all atomic weapons whether they were bomb, mine, shellor guided weapon.
50. We have considered this suggestion. We would hope that on matureconsideration the view would prevail that this appointment would be unnecessary.As we understand the position, a Controller implies an executive development and production authority. We cannot suppose that it is intended to take away responsi-bility, e.g., for Burghfield from the R.O.F. organisation under CS (M) on theground that it is permanently engaged in work connected with atomic weapons; or that responsibility for the bomb casing should be taken away from R.A.E. underCS (A) because a special section of Farnborough will be permanently devoted tosuch work. Moreover there appears to us to be a danger in this argument thatit might lead directly to a demand that such a Controller should have on his staffexperts in nuclear explosions in order that he should be capable of understandingwhat A.W.R.E. was talking about. For the reasons which we have given inparagraph 27 we are more than doubtful whether it will be necessary for the Ministryof Supply to concern themselves with the working of the nuclear device as distinct from those of its characteristics which determine certain of the requirements ofthe conventional parts of the weapon. Any unnecessary demands for nuclearphysicists and engineers, who are in very short supply, should in our view be resisted.51. We do however concede that there will be a case for maintaining a specialdirectorate in the Ministry of Supply to undertake the overall progressing of research, development and production of all work in hand either by the corporation or by any of the three Controllers of the Ministry of Supply on atomic weaponsso as to ensure that the programme for each weapon is kept in balance. Theredoes not at present seem to be any one authority responsible for progressing atomicand conventional components alike. Considerable responsibility seems to be under-taken for this at A.W.R.E. but this could hardly remain there after the transfer tothe Corporation. The need for a clear pattern of responsibility will be even moreimportant in future in view of our recommendation that requirements should beput separately and jointly to the Corporation and to the Ministry of Supply(see paragraph 27) and not in the first place exclusively by the Service departments to the Ministry of Supply. This directorate will also be the authority for ServiceApproval of Ministry of Supply components. It will no doubt be considered desirable to create a separate Service Approval authority in the Corporation butin that case special arrangements will have to be made for it to act in the closestliaison with the Ministry of Supply directorate in order to ensure that user require-ments are safeguarded in respect of the weapon as a whole. Should anydisagreement arise, appeal would be made to the Service Department concerned.52. It naturally follows from this that we do not envisage that the Ministryof Supply would place a contract direct with A.W.R.E. or that the Ministry ofSupply would have any direct relation with A.W.R.E. such as would put them ina position of customer to contractor. Contracts of this sort would in any caseappear to be ruled out by the security requirements since money paid under such contracts would have to appear as a receipt in the Vote of the designated ministry and would thus reveal the extent of the weapons programme (see paragraph 54).PART IV.-FINANCE53. General.-\t is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy whatthe annual cost of the Corporation would be: there is inevitably much uncertainty about future developments and requirements, military and civil, in the atomic energy field, and while certain expenditures (e.g., on conventional components of atomic weapons) now included in the Estimate of about  47 million for 1953-54would continue to be met by the Ministry of Supply, others (e.g., Common Servicesexpenditures) not included would have to be met by the Corporation. As it is,however, clear that for at least many years to come expenditure will be very heavy and receipts small (see paragraphs 18 and 62) we consider, and it has beenaccepted by all those appearing before us who are concerned with the financing ofthe new organisation, that the money required would have to be voted annually by Parliament to the designated Ministry! We think toolhat, as the corporation would have to work on general lines laid down by the Government and the sums involved are very large, the amount provided each year should be in the form of agrant, unspent money being surrendered at the end of the year, and not a grant-in-aid.
54. Form of the Estimate and the Defence Budget. It would in normal circumstances be desirable that the annual estimate presented to Parliament shouldbe in such a form as to show clearly the main heads of expenditure, separatingmilitary expenditure from civil and capital from current. There might also be advantage in recovering from the Defence Departments the cost, including research and development costs, of atomic weapons, since this would bring home to theDefence Departments, and to Parliament, the total defence bill. Apart, however,from the difficulty that allocation of much of the expenditure, particularly on research, between military and civil purposes, would have to be somewhat arbitrary,the Ministry of Defence witnesses represented very strongly that no information should be published which would make it possible to assess expenditure on atomic energy weapon research and production. They put forward instead the suggestionthat for ordinary administrative purposes a figure could be arrived at which repre-sented the proportion of the Corporation^ expenditure devoted to defence andthis figure could be taken into account in determining the Defence Budget, thoughit would not be published in the defence White Paper or elsewhere. We note inthis connection that in the United States the relevant Appropriation Acts for the atomic Energy Commission give only a total, without details. If the objectionsput forward by the Ministry of Defence are accepted there can be no accountingbetween Departments, and no division of the published figure into military and civil.55. Accounting Officer. It has been suggested to us that the annual grantsby Parliament should be accounted for by a member of the Corporation and not bythe Permanent Secretary to the designated Minister as this latter arrangement would tend to involve acceptance of responsibility by the Minister in Parliament for allacts of the Corporation, however unimportant, and to rob the Board of the Cor-poration of the power of quick decisions on matters of detail. We consider, how-ever, that the large sums which would have to be provided from public funds mustbe at the disposal of a Minister whose Accounting Officer would ensure that theconditions attached by Parliament were observed, and we agree with the view of theTreasury witnesses that there should in practice be no insuperable difficulty aboutmaking arrangements to ensure that the Minister and his Accounting Officer are notrequired to answer for all the detail of the Corporation^, financial arrangements.56. It was also suggested to us by the Ministry of Supply representatives that,if the designated Minister was to be responsible for an organisation which included a.W.R.E., there would be an awkward division of responsibility between the accouting Officer of the designated Minister on the one hand and the AccountingOfficer of the Minister of Supply on the other. We do not think this difficulty will arise. As we have explained elsewhere the requirements of the Service Depart-ments for fissile cores will be stated directly to the Corporation and theCorporation will make direct deliveries to the Services.57. Delegation of Financial Authority to the Corporation. In most, respectswe should not expect arrangements for ensuring adequate financial control byParliament and the Treasury to differ widely from the normal departmental patternfor obtaining approval of the Estimate and, subsequently, of individual items ofexpenditure. It would, however, be essential to ensure that these arrangementsgive the Corporation freedom to conduct its day to day affairs, including theexecution of large capital projects, in a businesslike way. We think it best to leavethe detailed arrangements for discussion between the Corporation, the parentdepartment and the Treasury at the appropriate time. But if the Corporation isto conduct its work with efficiency and despatch we think that rather moreflexibility and discretion than usual is necessary for projects involving capitalexpenditure. We understand that the normal arrangements for the defence departments give them delegated powers to spend amounts varying from  10,000to  30,000 on Works Services: we do not wish to suggest a definite figure but weconsider that the Corporation should be allowed to proceed, after the annualEstimate has been approved, within a higher figure than  30,000 without further reference to the parent department or the Treasury. Where the capital expendi-ture involved is in excess of this higher figure we think it would help the projectforward if arrangements similar to those made during the last war were adopted and the Corporation^ proposals were discussed and settled by a committee repre-senting the Treasury, the designated department and the Corporation.
58. Audit. Though the nationalised industries have their accounts auditedby commercial auditors they are, generally speaking, financially independentwhereas the Corporation would be for many years to come almost wholly dependenton monies voted by Parliament. For this reason we consider audit by the Comp-troller and Auditor General appropriate; we feel sure that Parliament would notin any case accept any other arrangement. We presume that in the exercise of his powers the Comptroller and Auditor General would have regard to the special arrangements for delegation of financial authority to the Corporation as suggestedin the foregoing paragraph.PART V. THE corporation the Tasks of the Corporation59. The task of the Corporation will be to carry forward the United kingdom atomic energy programme in accordance with policy directions given by the Govern-ment. In doing so it will have to satisfy the designated Ministers department thatit is both carrying out specific directives and maintaining a proper balance betweenweapons, power and the biological applications. We have already dealt with the weapons side. The achievement of a proper balance on the power side may provemore difficult because the practical problems posed by the development of atomicpower are only beginning to crystallise (see paragraph 12), and because the effort to be put into the development of power is less susceptible to exact measurementthan is effort on the weapons side. One form in which a precise issue will arisefor Government decision is the allocation of fissile material once produced betweenthe two purposes.60. There is one aspect of the power problem- on which it is already becomingpossible to form a view. There has been in some quarters a tendency to hope thatan atomic energy undertaking in this country might eventually become in large measure self-supporting because of the revenue to be derived from the generation of electricity from atomic power. This would clearly involve, as time went on,the acceptance of the Corporation as a competitor with the British electricity authority and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.61. The Ministry of Fuel and Power told us that they were opposed to sucha development. In their view the B.E.A. should continue to be responsible forgenerating electricity and the Corporation should be responsible only for the supplyof the fuel elements and for the withdrawal and subsequent handling of irradiatedelements. The development of power reactors to the point at which they weretechnically and economically satisfactory would remain the responsibility of theCorporation. But when such a position had been reached on any one reactor the specification should, on terms to be settled, be handed over to the B.E.A. whichwould commission industry to produce such reactors and should itself aim to operate them. B.E.A. would thus be a good customer of the Corporation fromwhich it would buy the fuel elements; on the other hand, the Corporation wouldpurchase the irradiated elements from the B.E.A. But whether this would on balance mean that there was a net payment by the B.E.A. to the Corporation orthe other way round, no one can prophesy. In any case it would be B.E.A. which provided the investment and which undertook the sale of electricity.62. This view of the Ministry of Fuel and Power as put to us rested upontwo assumptions:  (a) that it will be possible to generate power economically from atomic energywithout regard.to the military demand for plutonium;(b) that the Government would not require the reactors, or a large proportionof them, to be run for the production of military fissile material.Provided that these assumptions are valid we agree with the Ministry of Fuel and power. It is not desirable either in its own interest or those of the nation that theCorporation should become a large-scale competitor of B.E.A. in the productionof electrical power. We would certainly expect that the Corporation would findits dealings with the B.E.A. profitable whatever the net accounting between themturns out to be and this must depend on whether it is decided that the B.E.A.&apos;spayments should include an element for royalties.   But the Corporation^ profit
must be small in relation to its total turnover, and it would still be largely and in perpetuity dependent on Government funds, i.e., its expenditure on the researchside would not be to any large extent offset by receipts and certainly not to theextent of making any contribution at all towards the cost of its military expenditureon behalf of the Government. This conclusion is a significant one when consideringthe nature of the Corporation^ relations to the Government in the long term.63. Paradoxically, if either of the Ministry of Fuel and Power&apos;s assumptionsis falsified, the relative financial position of the Corporation may become somewhatstronger. If it is found that the generation of electrical power continues to beuneconomic except after the value of fissile material for military purposes hasbeen credited, or if it is decided by the Government that all or most of the reactorsmust in any case be run primarily for military purposes, then it may well be foundthat such reactors ought to remain under the direct operation of the Corporationwhich will then be generating a limited amount of electrical power which the B.E.A.would be expected to buy for the grid. Even, however, if such a pessimistic viewof the technical and international outlook should prove to be justified, it would not greatly affect the degree of dependence of the Corporation upon Government funds.Medical and Biological64. So far the biological applications of atomic energy have mainly receivedattention from two points of view. The first is that of radiation protection of theworkers and of the public (see paragraph 13), and the second is the developmentof the production of isotopes and their utilisation in medicine, industry and agri-culture. Hitherto the initiative in biological research has come from the medical research Council. We were told on behalf of the Council that they had not been sufficiently consulted in the past, and that this had resulted in an unnecessarilycautious view being taken of the radiation risks. The Medical Research Councilhope that there will be close consultation between them and the Corporation atthe design stage of all future projects. They recognise that one must distinguish between:  (i) the health physics work in the plants which enforces standards laid downelsewhere.  This must be a responsibility of the Corporation; and,(ii) the research service which has to establish the correct standards to been forced.The Council hope that the Corporation will have staff of sufficient calibre to ensurethat the health physics workers in the plants get all the assistance they need. Theyconsider, however, that the main responsibility for research must continue to beundertaken by the M.R.C., since research on human exposure to radiation has tobe linked with clinical work, e.g., in connection with cancer therapy; and also because the M.R.C. is in a specially favourable position in some respects to recruitgood biologists and biochemists.65. We certainly agree that there ought to be the closest possible consultationwith the M.R.C. We are not, however, satisfied that the stationing of M.R.C. units at project plants, in the way that the Radio-biological Research Unit is stationed at Harwell, is sufficient. The Corporation ought to have a responsibility for thewhole field of nuclear energy so that it can aim at securing a proper balance in its activities. It ought not to be relegated to carrying out technical directives given from outside. There should, therefore, be scope for research within the corporation on the biological and biochemical aspects of atomic energy; at the same time onlyexperience can show how responsibility for these fields of research can be distributed between the Corporation and the M.R.C.Internal Organisation of the Corporation66. In approaching the internal organisation of the Corporation we have oneparamount consideration in mind: it is that the present organisation for atomic energy is too loosely knit. The efforts of the first Controller of Atomic Energy (seeparagraph 8) resulted in effecting a limited measure of co-ordination between thevarious establishments concerned and this process has been carried somewhatfurther by the present device of an Atomic Energy Board presided over by a cabinet minister. The project remains, however, an association of three sets of establish-ments rather than one integrated organisation. H.Q. control is weak; this is hardly surprising since there is no technical staff at H.Q. Largely because of thisweakness, but partly in a praiseworthy effort to emancipate the scientists and44553 d 2
5\ Vengineers from Civil Service routine, delegation of authority to establishmentsseems to have gone so far that considerable changes of policy can be decided on atestablishments without H.Q. being informed. When the technical directors domeet, they come together as heads of establishments conferring one with the otherrather than as a collectively responsible Board. This is a feature in the presentsystem which should not be carried over into the new.The Board67. The first need of the Corporation will therefore be a strong Board. Itmust be a mainly functional Board, for the main task will be of technical policy.We do not conceive of the Board as consisting of persons with general experience in business, labour relations, finance, &amp;c, if only for the reason that the matters ofbroad policy, with which such persons would be specially qualified to deal, will inpractice be reserved to the Government.68. The key appointment will be that of Chairman of the Board, who should,in our opinion, perform the functions of a General Manager.We cannot stress too much the need for getting a man of wide sympathies andoutstanding ability to fill this post.69. There should then be four functional directors: one for engineering and production; one for weapons; one for research; and one for administration and finance.In principle, the first three of these, i.e., the technical functional directors, oughtto be distinct from the heads of the various establishments, i.e., of the ProductionDivision of A.W.R.E., and of Harwell. It will be impossible at the outset to carryout this proper separation between the H.Q. functional directors, and the heads of establishments. This is because the present heads of the three establishments arethe obvious choice as technical directors of the Board and because we believe thereare no replacements or deputies, immediately in view to take their place as heads of establishments. It will, if our recommendation is accepted, be necessary for thethree technical directors at the outset to do double jobs as Members of the Boardand as Heads of Establishments. This arrangement may have to carry on for sometime, but there should be no avoidable delay in making appropriate consequentialarrangements. r70. Finally, we recommend the appointment of two part-time members ofthe Board in order that the Corporation should not become too inbred and thatit should be kept in touch with the outside world. We recommend that these part-time members should not have separate technical functions. It has, for instance,been suggested to us that there should be a military member of the Board in additionto the weapons director; and we understand that the Medical Research council would have welcomed the appointment of a member with a special interest in thebiological field. We do not accept these suggestions because we feel that theappointment of members with special interests is undesirable. The achievement of an overall balance in this work is the responsibility of the Corporation as a whole,which must satisfy the designated Minister that it is succeeding in maintaining sucha balance. The Weapons Director, for instance, would be in a position to bring to the notice of the designated Minister any respect on which he felt that the defence requirements of the Government were not being implemented. Nevertheless, wethink that such representations would be rare. The main safeguard is to ensurethat the separation between the responsibilities of functional directors and the responsibilities of heads of establishments is carried out. Once this is done we see no reason to fear that the Board will not develop a truly collective attitude towardsits responsibilities. We would only add that we attach great importance torestricting the size of the Board to the numbers we have suggested.Co-ordination within the Corporation71. We do not propose to make any detailed recommendations as to the way in which the Corporation should carry out its work. It may be useful, however, to mention one or two of the minor criticisms of the present organisation which havebeen made to us: for example, that those responsible for the engineering work carried out for Harwell and Aldermaston are not closely in touch with those engagedin engineering work for the production division; again that there is inadequateco-ordination of the research work done at Harwell and at Risley respectively; andthat the production and research work at Aldermaston is left too much in isolation.
72. We consider that our proposals for the central direction of the project bya largely functional Board would remedy most of these weaknesses, so far as they exist. Even at the outset when the three heads of establishments are doubling jobsas functional directors, they should sit on the Board as directors of research, of engineering and production and of weapons-and not as heads of establishments.The research director would therefore be responsible for pure and applied researchboth at Harwell and in the Risley organisation, while the engineering director wouldbe responsible for engineering work carried out, not only at Risley but also atHarwell and Aldermaston.Future of the Production Division73. There were two other criticisms of the present production organisation which were made to us:  (1) That the organisation is over-strained at the top and that the whole toplevel organisation and the salaries received are inadequate whencompared with those of industrial concerns undertaking capital development, much of it repeat work, of comparable size.(2) That the production division is in danger of becoming unwieldy and thatit ought to be split into two parts, the one handling new design and construction work and the other handling current factory operations.74. Both these criticisms are of course a symptom of the same cause: the enormous burdens placed upon the whole organisation by the United Kingdom&apos;determination to carry forward single handed and with the greatest possible speeda considerable atomic energy programme. The one criticism, however, is directed towards securing a large-scale infusion of brains from outside industry; the othertries to make the problem more manageable by splitting it into two, though withoutnecessarily increasing the resources available for either. We have every hope thatthe setting up of a Corporation will enable the production division to attract theadditional top-level support which it needs and that it will in other ways give the division the freedom to develop which has hitherto not been afforded to it. Wedo not wish to record any view as to whether the difficulties of the productiondivision would become less if it were split between factory work and design work.We think it would certainly be a great mistake to undertake such an operation inadvance of the setting up of the Corporation. The interim period will be full&apos;of problems and no unnecessary changes should be introduced during that time.When the Corporation is set up it will, no doubt, undertake a thoroughgoingenquiry into the future of the production division.Salaries and Conditions of Service75. The need to pay salaries on an industrial scale will not necessarily belimited to the production division. Special arrrangements will be required to enablethe Corporation to compete with industry for men for all its top-level posts. Belowthe top, however, all reasonable steps must be taken to avoid standards which arewidely divergent from those in the Civil Service. We fully agree with the repre-sentations made to us on behalf of the Treasury and of the Ministries of Supplyand Defence that the general salary-levels in the Corporation must not be suchas to spread discontent or lead to undue loss of staff from other government establishments.76. Provided that there is a general understanding to this effect between theCorporation and the designated Minister, we think that the Corporation shouldnot be subject to specific direction in this matter of salaries. We understand thatprecedent will require that the salaries and conditions of service of the membersof the Board itself should have Government approval. But apart from this, wedo not think that the designated Minister ought to have detailed responsibilityfor conditions of service since this might be thought to render him answerable toParliament to an undesirable extent for matters of detail. We were advised by theTreasury that there was no point in putting a general injunction about salariesinto the legislation since experience had shown that such an injunction was difficultto police.
Security11. The problem of security always bulks large in connection with any atomic energy undertaking carried on in present circumstances. There seem to be twoviews about the standard of security in the present project. All those who havehad responsibility for advice or enforcement consider that the arrangements are satisfactory. On the other hand, some of those who have had no such responsibilityfeel that security in the project is not satisfactory and that it is difficult to makeit so within the Civil Service rules. Those who hold this view hope that security in the Corporation will be stricter than at present. The staff unions and associa-tions, however, have represented most strongly that the standard of securityenforcement need not and should not be more stringent than it is at present, andthat there should not be any increase in what is regarded as interference withpeoples&apos; private lives.78. We do not propose to make any recommendations about the standardsor methods of security to be applied by the Corporation. In our view the Corpora-tion should start off by applying those standards which are at present in force.If it is later felt that any change is desired, this should be discussed with the staffunions during the secondment period (see paragraph 85). Before the end of thisperiod, we hope the process of &quot; positive vetting &quot; of the existing staff should be complete and the security problem may thereafter seem somewhat simpler.79. It must, however, be clear whether responsibility for the enforcement of security rests with the Corporation or with the designated Minister. The Ministryof Supply told us that in their view a public onus of decision should be on theBoard, which would be assisted by a panel similar to the &quot; three advisers &quot; whofunction in Civil Service cases. This would be preferable to an appeal to the designated Minister since this would detract from the status of the Corporation:nevertheless, the Corporation could not be left entirely free to make its owndecisions in security cases subject only to a general directive to observe Civil Servicestandards. A Board of a Corporation might on occasion find it difficult to weighits need for a particular man against his security background, especially as theBoard could not always be given full information by the Security Service. TheGovernment must, therefore, retain the right to direct the Corporation to dispense with a particular man or to move him on to other work. It was suggested that direction might be welcomed by the Board in difficult cases. Such a privy pro-cedure in fact operates in the case of the Ministry of Supply contractors at present:in all contracts on secret work there is a clause which enables the Minister to direct that the contractor remove a particular employee from work on contract. In suchcases the Minister goes to great pains to reach the correct decision, but there isno open appeal to him. The Ministry of Supply agreed that it would not be easy to marry such a system where the real decision was reached privately by theMinister to a system where there was apparently a genuine appeal, but the appellantbody was in fact bound by a decision reached elsewhere. In one respect the Cor-poration would, like Government contractors, be in a better position than aGovernment Department when dispensing with an employee^ service, i.e., it wouldbe able (or might when breaking a contract which was in terms of years)be required)to pay compensation, v/hich a Department cannot do even when they consider the hardship is caused by their decision. On the other hand, the Government cantransfer a worker with a doubtful security background to a non-secret Governmentpost.80. As to this last point, the Staff Side specially submitted to us that theright to be considered for such a transfer should be retained even after the Cor-poration is formed, We do not see how this would be possible to arrange once thesecondment period is over and the staff have accepted contracts giving employment on Corporation terms.81. We do not think it possible or desirable to attempt to settle these difficultmatters in advance. We recommend that security should be primarily the responsi-bility of the Corporation but that it should be recognised that the designatedMinister may from time to time or as occasion may arise require to satisfy himself as to the working of the security arrangements. We assume for the rest that carewill be taken to see that the necessary security resources are placed at the disposalof the Corporation and that where necessary, as in the case of the War DepartmentConstabulary, legislation will cover the use of such resources by the Corporation.
PART VI. TRANSFER PROBLEMSTransfer of Staff82. If the Atomic Energy project is to be transferred to a Corporation withoutany setback to the present programme, it will be necessary to ensure that the greatmajority of Civil Servants now working in the project go over to the new Corpora-tion. For this reason, although the Prime Minister had already given an assurancein the House of Commons (on the 28th April) that, whatever changes might bedecided upon, the rights and interests of existing staff would be fully respectedand consultation with staff representatives would take place at the appropriate time, we thought it right to accede to the request of the staff representatives thatthey should be given a chance to apprise us of the points at which, in their opinion,their interests would be affected by the proposed transfer.83. Both the Trade Union side and the Staff side emphasised that it was essential that they should be given at the earliest possible date all available informa-tion on future conditions of service; that there should be full and timely consulta-tion on the problems which were bound to arise out of the proposed transfer; thatthe Corporation should &quot; recognise &quot; the appropriate Unions and Staff associations and make provision for joint consultation between employees and the managementon the general lines of the Whitley system. The Trade Union side also underlinedthe great importance it attached to preserving access to Ministers, at the national level, on matters of general importance on which agreement could not be reached with the &quot; management,&quot; for example, wages and conditions of service generally,and the manner in which security measures were applied in particular: it did not want the new Corporation to be placed in the same position as the National coal board, where the sponsoring Minister, the Minister of Fuel and Power, had no direct responsibility.84. Apart from these general interests the particular points to which the staff representatives attached importance were:  (a) Trade Union Side(i) Establishment prospects of non-established industrials. At present under an agreement reached with the Official Side, industrials, after three years service (the qualifying period) have a reasonableexpectation of establishment. In accordance with this agreement,the established complement is limited to those normally determinedby seniority who &quot; can reasonably be expected to be employed.... permanently.&quot; But it so happens that the Atomic Energyestablishments are due for an increase in establishment com-plements, and this means that a number of men who have com-pleted, or are about to complete, three years service can reasonably expect to be established in the near future. Once established,previous service counts, for pension purposes under the Super-annuation Acts, in full from June 1949, and as to one half before that date. The Trade Unions therefore suggested that those withestablishment prospects should not lose them as a result of a Gov-ernment decision to transfer responsibility for establishments setup by the Government to a non-departmental organisation, what-ever the position might be on the wider question of supplementary pensions in the nationalised industries.(ii) Maintenance of other conditions of service. Such as the Code ofIndustrial Travelling Rules; Transfer Rules; Paid Sick Leave; and leave for Trade Union and certain other purposes.(b) Staff Side(i) Tenure of Appointments. The Staff side hoped that the corporation would make an early statement on the permanency of its establishedstaff, for example, that established staff would have the same degreeof permanency as is enjoyed at present by established Civil Servants.They also hoped that encouragement would be given to transfers of technical and scientific staff between the Corporation and theCivil Service.
(ii) Pensions. The Staff Side assumed that the Corporation would wishto set up its own pension scheme. It was hoped, however, that before any new pension scheme was introduced by the Corporationit would be discussed either with the National Whitley Council or with any central consultative body analogous to that Council whichmight be set up in the Corporation. More immediately nothing should be done to prejudice the position of staff to whom an option had been given recently to transfer from F.S.S.U. to thenormal Superannuation Acts scheme. Temporary staff after sevenyear&apos;s service had a virtual right to a gratuity on leaving the Serviceand this right of the existing entitled staff should be safeguarded.(iii) Security arrangements. The staff should be told before they haveto transfer if any changes were contemplated, as a reduction in existing safeguards would be regarded as a serious matter.85. The general impression we formed from the evidence given by the staff representatives and in discussion with representatives of the Treasury and theOfficial side of the Ministry of Supply was that most staff would be ready to transferif they were satisfied that conditions of service would be at least as good as thosethey now enjoyed, but that a transitional period of at least one, and possibly twoyears would be necessary to give staff sufficient experience of the working of thenew Corporation before they had to take a final decision to transfer or not. Wehave little doubt that the new Corporation would be able to offer conditions ofservice which would in general be sufficiently attractive to induce the great majorityof the existing staff to transfer and the discussions we had with Treasury repre-sentatives, and the written evidence they submitted, made it clear to us that, ingeneral, an interim period during which the Civil Servants concerned maintained their present status unimpaired should not present much difficulty. With regardto the specific points made by the staff representatives we made it clear to themthat we could only undertake to bring these to the attention of the Government aswe have now done; we assume, however, that there will be adequate consultationwith representatives of the staff at the appropriate time.Interim Period86. As soon as a definite Government decision to set up a Corporation hasbeen taken it will be necessary to:  (i) draft the necessary legislation;(ii) prepare the way for setting up the Corporation as a separate administrativeentity, i.e., providing it with its share of the common services (seeparagraph 33).We think that there is a strong case for transferring the responsibility forthwith to the designated Ministry. It seems to us better that the legislation should be drafted and carried through by a Minister and officials who would bear responsi-bility for its future successful working, rather than by those who would have nofuture concern with it. An immediate transfer would also have two other advantages:  Firstly, the necessary administrative and personnel changes would bespread over a period rather than concentrated all at one time which might leadto a sudden disruption throughout the project. There would be two gradualchanges one to the new department and then to the Corporation.Secondly, it would perhaps be easier for those responsible for initiating the project if, during the separating out of the common services of the Ministryof Supply, which would raise awkward staff transfer problems, they were ableon occasion to appeal to a Minister who would be generally responsible forthe successful working of the Corporation.87. We therefore recommend that when the Government announce their decision to set up a Corporation they should also announce their intention totransfer responsibility at once, by Order in Council under the Ministers of theCrown (Transfer of Functions Act) to the designated Ministry.88. We have been admirably served by our Secretaries. Their task has notbeen easy or light and they have discharged it to our entire satisfaction.
SUMMARY .Transfer of ResponsibilityI. We recommend that an Atomic Energy Corporation should be established.This should be a statutory Corporation with an executive Board.2. There should be transferred to this Corporation from the Ministry ofSupply the responsibility for the establishments at present controlled by the atomic energy Research Establishment (Harwell); by the Production Division; and by the atomic Weapons Research Establishment.3. The Ministry of Supply should continue to be responsible for the conven-tional components of atomic weapons.4. Well in advance of the vesting date, action should be taken to provide, ina form suitable for transfer to the Corporation, the majority of the common services provided at present by the Headquarters Divisions of the Ministry of Supply jointlyfor the Atomic Energy and other Establishments of that Ministry.5. The question whether or not to use the Ministry of Works as an Agent for building services should be left for decision until the Corporation is established.The designated Minister6. There should be designated a Minister responsible to Parliament for moniesprovided for the Corporation and for the policy directions given to the Corporation.The main task of this Minister will be to ensure the well being and efficiency of theCorporation as a whole and the maintenance of a balance between the use of atomic energy for defence, for power and to an increasing extent in the biological applica-tions, in conformity with policy laid down from time to time by Ministers collec-tively. This Minister should be one of the existing Ministers of high Cabinet rankwho has no departmental responsibilities which encroach upon the field of atomic energy. The most suitable Minister seems to be the Lord President of the Council.We do not, however, make a specific recommendation that he should be designatedsince there might be advantage in leaving it open to the Government of the day toconsider which of the holders of the sinecure offices should be charged with this special and rather personal responsibility.7. The procurement of uranium and thorium should be the task of the designated Minister; this responsibility should not be transferred to theCorporation.8. There should be a Ministerial Committee representative of all the Ministerswhose Departments are concerned with the various aspects of atomic energy. the designated Minister should be the Chairman of this Committee.9. The designated Minister would require a small group of officials to assist them. These officials should constitute a small department responsible solely tohim and should not owe allegiance to any of the Departments having a particular interest in the applications of atomic energy.10. An official Committee representative of all the Departments concernedwith atomic energy will be required as at present.II. The Corporation should at the outset be given a directive requiring it to consult the official Committee on all matters of external policy. The channel of communications for agreed decisions on such matters of policy should be throughthe Foreign Office or the Commonwealth Relations Office as the case may be.12. The Ministry of Defence should remain generally responsible, after theCorporation is set up, for the allocation of resources available for defence purposesbetween atomic weapons and conventional arms and for the distribution of effortbetween the research, development and production of atomic weapons.Finance13. The Corporation^ expenditure will be very heavy and at least for manyyears to come its receipts will be relatively small. We recommend that the money required should be voted annually by Parliament to the designated Ministry in theform of a grant, unspent money being surrendered at the end of the year.
14. We recommend that responsibility for securing observance of the con-ditions attached by Parliament to this yearly grant should rest, subject to the designated Minister, with an Accounting Officer who should be the official head ofthat Ministers Department. There should be no insuperable difficulty about making arrangements to ensure that the Minister and his Accounting Officer are not requiredto answer for all the detail of the Corporation^ financial arrangements.15. We should not expect the arrangements for ensuring adequate financial control, as normally exercised by Parliament and the Treasury, to differ widelyfrom the usual departmental pattern for obtaining approval of the annual estimateand subsequently of individual items of expenditure. It would however be essentialto ensure that these arrangements give the Corporation freedom to conduct itsaffairs, including the execution of large capital projects, in a businesslike way. the detailed arrangements should be left for discussion between the Corporation, the designated Ministers Department and the Treasury at the appropriate time.16. The Corporation should be allowed rather more flexibility and discretion in respect of capital expenditure than is usual with Government Departments; itshould be allowed to proceed, after the annual estimate has been approved, andwithout further reference to the designated Department or the Treasury, withprojects up to a higher figure than is permitted to Departments.17. Audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General will be appropriate. Wepresume that in the exercise of his powers the Comptroller and Auditor-general would have regard to the special arrangements for delegation of financial authorityto the Corporation.   &quot;The Corporation18. The Chairman of the Board of the Corporation should discharge thefunctions of a General Manager. The Board should include four whole-time func-tional directors: one for engineering and production; one for weapons; one for research and one for administration and finance. In addition, we recommend theappointment of two part-time members without a separate technical function.19. Special arrangements will be required. in respect of salaries and con-ditions of service, to enable the Corporation to compete with industry for men forall its top level posts; below the top, however, all reasonable steps must be takento avoid standards widely divergent from those in the Civil Service.20. Security should be primarily the responsibility of the Corporation; butthat it should be recognised that the designated Minister may from time to time or as occasion may require, satisfy himself as to the working of the security arrangements.Transfer Problems21. Special consideration should be given to safeguarding, so far as possible,the interests of existing Civil Servants working in the atomic energy undertakingswhen responsibility for these is transferred to the Corporation. The followingpoints (on which, however, we do not feel called upon to make any specific recom-mendation) were particularly mentioned to us by the Trade Union side of the joint industrial Council and the Staff side of the Ministry of Supply AdministrativeWhitley Council:  (a) Information on future conditions of service should be made available tothe staff at the earliest possible moment.(b) There should be full and timely consultation on problems arising out ofthe transfer.(c) The Corporation should recognise the appropriate Unions and staff associations, and make provision for joint consultation betweenemployees and management on the general lines of the Whitley system.(d) Safeguards should be provided for the establishment prospects of thepresent non-established industrials; for the virtual right of temporary staff after seven years&apos; service to a gratuity; and for other conditionsof service such as the Code of Industrial Travelling rules; transferrules; paid sick leave; and leave for Trade Union and certain other purposes.(e) Before any new pension scheme is introduced by the Corporation, it should. be discussed with Staff representatives.
(/) Access to Ministers on matters of general importance, at present enjoyed by staff organisations, should be preserved.(g) An early statement should be made on security of tenure under theCorporation.22. The staff of the atomic energy undertakings should be seconded at the vesting date by the Civil Service to the Corporation for an initial period. Duringthe transitional period, which might have to extend to two years, the staff would maintain their Civil Service status unimpaired. Before the end of this interim period we should expect the Corporation to offer individuals employment onCorporation terms, and individuals would have to decide whether to accept those terms or not.23. After the Government^ decision to set up a Corporation has been taken,it will be necessary to draft the necessary legislation and prepare the way for makingthe Corporation a separate administrative entity. These tasks should be undertaken by those who will bear responsibility for the Corporation^ successful working.We therefore recommend that when the Government announce their decision toset up a Corporation they should also announce their intention to transfer responsi-bility at once to the designated Minister.WAVERLEY.W.

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON GENOCIDEMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Cabinet have before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C. (53) 203) covering the draft of a Bill to enable effect to be given to the Inter&quot;national Convention on Genocide.    On a balance of argument I recommend thatthe Cabinet should decide to accede to the Convention as soon as the necessary legislation has been enacted.2.        The principal objection to accession is that it implies in respect of crimes of genocide a partial surrender of the traditional right of politicalasylum.    The crime of genocide as defined in the International Convention is,however, of a very repugnant character and I imagine that no Government inthis country would be likely to v/ish to refuse extradition in the case of personswho really appeared prima facie to have been guilty of it.    A sufficient safe-guard against the possibility that foreign States might seek to abuse their rightto demand extradition resides in the undoubted right of the Home Secretary torefuse extradition in cases where he is not convinced of the bona fides of thecharge.    The Government is moreover morally bound to Parliament to accede to the Convention, provided that the legal difficulties which have been explained to Parliament can be overcome.    The draft Bill now circulated by the HomeSecretary shows that this can be done and further delay in reaching a decisionto accede to the Convention could not be easily explained in Parliament andwould certainly cause us difficulty in the United Nations.3.        It is important that we should not accede to the Convention until we arein a position to carry it out in the spirit and in the letter.    Accordingly, i recommend that the Cabinet should now decide to accede to the Convention assoon as the necessary legislation can be enacted and that this position shouldbe announced to Parliament.    In doing this I should hope that time might befound for this Bill during the next session, but if this proves inapossible Ishould hope that it could be taken without fail in the succeeding session.Foreign Office, S.
