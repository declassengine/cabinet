3.2.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE - PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALC.(53) 209 COPY NO. 6^24TH JULY, 1953. cabinet internation CONVENTION ON GENOCIDEMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Cabinet have before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C.(53) 203) covering the draft of a Bill to enable effect to be given to the Inter-national Convention on Genocide.    On a balance of argument I recommend thatthe Cabinet should decide to accede to the Convention as soon as the necessary legislation has been enacted.2.        The principal objection to accession is that it implies in respect of crimes of genocide a partial surrender of the traditional right of politicalasylum.    The crime of genocide as defined in the International Convention is,however, of a very repugnant character and I imagine that.no Government inthis country would be likely to wish to refuse extradition in the case of personswho really appeared prima facie to have been guilty of it.    A sufficient safe-guard against the possibility that foreign States might seek to abuse their rightto demand extradition resides in the undoubted right of the Home Secretary torefuse extradition in cases where he is not convinced of the bona fides of thecharge.    The Government is moreover morally bound to Parliament to accede to the Convention, provided that the legal difficulties which have been explained to Parliament can be overcome.    The draft Bill now circulated by the HomeSecretary shows that this can be done and further delay in reaching a decisionto accede to the Convention could not be easily explained in Parliament andwould certainly cause us difficulty in the United Nations.3.        It is important that we should not accede to the Convention until we arein a position to carry it out in the spirit and in the letter.    Accordingly, i recommend that the Cabinet should now decide to accede to the Convention assoon as the necessary legislation can be enacted and that this position shouldbe announced to Parliament.    In doing this I should hope that time might befound for this Bill during the next session, but if this proves impossible Ishould hope that it could be taken without fail in the succeeding session.l-i.Foreign Office, S.W.I.23RD JULY, 1953.
