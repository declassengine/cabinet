4,0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 217 copy NO. (jV28th JULY, 1953.CABINETJUDGES&apos; REMUNERATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 14th May (C.C.(53) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet invited me to circulate for their consideration detailed proposalsfor improving the remuneration of the Judges by an increase in gross salarycoupled with a tax-free allowance for travelling expenses.2. When we previously discussed the matter, I had been advised that an allowance for travelling expenses such as I contemplated would be free of tax under the existing law.   But I have been forced to reconsider thispart of my proposals, because I am now told that, as a result of variousrecent developments, the allowance would very likely be liable to tax.Admittedly the law is uncertain, but it would be impossible for Ministers tostate categorically (as would, of course, be necessary) that the allowance would not be taxable as the law now stands.   It would therefore be necessary toprovide specifically in the Bill that this allowance should be treated as tax-free when drawn by Judges, and since it is at least possible that such an allowance would be taxable if drawn by anyone else, this provision would clearly lead us into grave embarrassments.   I have considered other possibilities, and have put the whole problem to the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland.As a result, we are all three agreed that it would be wisest to drop this partof the proposals and to rely simply on a substantial increase in gross salaries.3. I propose that all the salaries should be increased by  3,000.This means that the great majority of the Judges in question would get  8,000instead of  5,000, representing a net increase of  842 over what their netsalaries were worth when the present Bill was introduced.   The detailed effect is shown in the Annex.   If the Judge or his wife has substantial private means,the net benefit would of course not be so great, owing to the operation ofsur-tax.   But this result cannot be avoided by any scheme of increases in termsof gross remuneration.4. The ideas which I tentatively advanced before would have givensmaller increases to Judges now receiving less than  5,000, but I am nowpersuaded that a flat increase of the same amount to all is justifiable and islikely on the whole to provoke less opposition.5. Pensions      I propose that existing pensions should remain unchanged.   The pensions of the English Judges and the Law Lords are fixed at their present amounts by the Administration of Justice (Pensions) Act, 1950,and no difficulty arises.   But the pensions of Scottish Judges are fixed by an act of 1808 at three-quarters of the Judge&apos;s retiring salary, and a special provision in the Bill will therefore be necessary to ensure that the increase insalaries does not carry with it an increase in pensions.   A similar provision-1-
will be necessary in the case of the Northern Irish Judges, whose pensions are fixed at two-thirds of retiring salary by the Supreme Court of Judicature(Northern Ireland) Act, 1926.6. Circuit Allowances    English Judges who go on circuit at presentreceive an extra &quot;statutory tax-free allowance of  7, 10. 0. a day.   The LordChancellor agrees with me that these allowances should be reviewed in thelight of modern conditions and of the fact that circuit expenses vary widely indifferent circumstances.   The present rate of allowance has attracted some criticism, and it will be desirable to announce that it is being reviewed when theBill is presented.   I hope soon to agree with the Lord Chancellor revised rates which can be substituted, at least provisionally, for the present rate,   Ithink it will be desirable to take the opportunity of this Bill to put circuitallowances on to a statutory basis.   Circuit allowances are already statutoryin the case of the Scottish and Northern Irish Judiciary.7. The proposals in this Paper are agreed by the Lord chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and I ask my colleagues&apos; authority toarrange for a new Bill to be drafted to carry them out.R..A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.28th July, 1953.s

The net increases shown above are the increases over the net remuneration as itwas when the present Bill was introduced.   That is, they take account of the reductionin income tax effected by the 1953 Budget as well as the proposed increases in grosssalary.2.   The calculations of net income assume in each case that the Judge has a wifebut no dependent children, that neither he nor his wife has any private means, and thathe claims an expense allowance of  100 a year under the present law (for his robes,law library, etc.).
