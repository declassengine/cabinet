SECRETCAB!NET OFFiCIRECORD copy .(53) 248 COPY N(5TH SEPTEMBER, 1953CABINETAGRICULTURAL WAGES AND A SPECIAL, PRICE review memorandum by the Home Secretary, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the National Farmers&apos; Unions have asked for a Special Review, underSection 2(2) of the Agriculture Act, 1947, of the general economic conditions and prospects of the agricultural industry.    They expect that such a review would lead to increases in the guaranteed prices of the main agricultural products, soas to compensate farmers for the increases in minimum wage rates recentlydetermined by the Agricultural Wages Boards.    These increases were 7s. aweek in England and Wales and 8s. a week in Scotland.    This gives a total of 14jj millions in a full year for all agricultural commodities.2.        The Agriculture Act enables a Special Review to be held on the occasion of a change in costs which is sudden, substantial and of sufficient importance to&apos;justify such review.3.        All previous Special Reviews have been occasioned by changes in wages.These have always been accepted as sudden.    The precedents suggest that theamount of the present wage change, if this is considered alone, could be taken asboth substantial and of sufficient importance to justify a review.4.        But these  orecedents are not the only consideration.    In considering theeffect on the economic condition of the industry, we are, we think, bound to take account of the important change that is occurring in the level of feedingstuffprices.    At the time of the Annual Review last March it was estimated (and isstated in the White Paper, Command 8798, paragraph 10) that the removal of thefeedingstuffs subsidy on 1st April together with other increases would cause anaverage rise in purchased feed costs of about  2 10s. a ton.    Livestock prices were geared to that expectation.   In the event, the decline in world cereal T^rices,coupled with the freedom of internal trade following decontrol on 1st August, have resulted in the average price of feedingstuffs rising  1 10s. less than the expected amount.    The effect of this over a full year would be that costs ofproduction for all agricultural commodities would be  7f millions less than expected.    From this should properly be deducted  2^: millions on account ofa formula which links pig prices to feeding stuff prices.    But there remains anet amount in regard to feeding stuff prices of  5^ millions to be taken intoaccount in a full year for all commodities.5.        Last year, when we refused a Review, the reason   stated was that theamount of the wage change was not substantial, but we drew attention also toother changes that were taking place, in particular a decrease in fertiliserprices.    The decrease in feed prices this year represents a larger offset.We should not, however, wish to recognise this decrease as being substantial
within the meaning of the Act, and it has not been sudden. Thus it could not justify a review on its own account, and we could not proceed by undertakingtwo reviews &quot; one for wages and one for feeding stuffs.6.        If we set the change in feeding stuff prices against the wage change, thenet effect is an expected increase in costs for all commodities of about 8-f millions   ( 14:1 millions for wages less  5-1 millions net for feed).    for review commodities the net effect (corresponding to  8^ millions for allcommodities) would be millions only.    These commodities gain relativelymore from a feed price reduction and suffer relatively less from a wage change,than do non-review commodities.    Moreover, the extent to which a wage change is offset by a feed price change varies from one review commodity to another.For example, the cereals grower has to pay higher wages but derives no benefit from the change in feeding stuff prices.    That is an argument which the farmers will use against us.    Even so we do not feel that for any section of theindustry the net effect would be of sufficient importance for that section tojustify a review.7.        Accordingly we recommend that we should refuse a Special Review onthe ground that the effect of the wage change on the general economic conditionof the industry when the movement of feeding stuff prices is taken into account is not of sufficient importance to justify a review.8.        We expect that there will be dissatisfaction among farmers, which willbe expressed by their Unions.    But if we stress that we have taken account not simply of the wage change by itself but of the general effect, including the way in which other important factors in the cost of production are moving, we think they will recognise the broad justice of the conclusion reached.9.        We propose that we should be authorised to reply as follows:-&quot;The Government have considered the request for a Special Review.While they recognise the importance of the recent wage change, theycannot regard this in isolation.    As required by the Act they have had regard to its importance in relation to the economic conditions in theindustry.    This naturally includes the way in which other factors inthe cost of production have been moving as compared with the expectations of the last Annual Review on which the guaranteed prices were determined.    Their conclusion is that a Special Review is not justified on this occasion. &quot;D.M.F.J.S.T.L.D.4TH SEPTEMBER, 1953.
