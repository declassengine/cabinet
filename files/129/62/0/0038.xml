22nd AUGUST, 1953.CABINETKENYAMemorandum by the Minister of Statefor Colonial affairs in the absence of the Colonial Secretary I am circulating a note on thepresent situation in Kenya as requested by the Cabinet at their meeting on 18thAugust (C,C.(53) 49th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. GeneralGeneral Erskine&apos;s strategic plan in Kenya is broadly the same as that adopted by General Briggs in Malaya and he is meeting with the same difficulties.3. By concentrating his military offensive in turn on each of the AfricanReserves, and the adjacent forest areas, he aims to clean them up one by one;as each one is cleared of terrorist gangs, the position is to be&apos; consolidated bythe Civil Administration and the defence of the area handed over to the Police and home Guard.4. The three main difficulties are:-(a) Clearance is only partial.   Owing to the thick nature of the forestterrain, not only do the gangs - in groups or singly - slip through the militarycordon,but the hard core, entrenched deep in the forest, cannot be brought to battle.(b) Civilian morale, which is the key to intelligence and resistance toterrorism (in particular demands for supplies), is too dependent on the protection afforded by the presence of troops.   As soon as they are moved on to take the offensive elsewhere morale drops.(c) There are not enough Police to take over the intensive policingrequired to consolidate and sustain the position in areas which have receivedmilitary attention.5, These three factors make it difficult for General Erskine to maintainthe momentum of his offensive;  too many of his troops have to be widelydeployed in static defence,6. Results of Military OperationsTwo full-scale military operations have been carried out - &quot;Buttercup&quot;in the Fort Hall area and &quot;Carnation&quot; in the North Nueri area.   &quot;Buttercup&quot;achieved a considerable element of surprise and resulted in a large number ofMau Mau casualties but these were chiefly on the outer fringe - food carriers,messengers, etc. - and the hard core of the gangs was left largely intact.&quot;Carnation&quot; achieved little surprise and the terrorists for the most part succeeded in evading contact.SECRET fO. (53) 238 COPY NC.    3
Within the last 24 hours news has been received from Kenya thatletters have come in indicating readiness of certain gangs to surrender.General Erskine has therefore notified intention to issue a generalproclamation on Monday, 24th. August, calling on all gangs and gang leaders to surrender.   The terms of the proclamation have not yet been received.   Iflarge-scale surrenders should result, the situation will require freshappreciation, but in my opinion this latest development should be viewed withcaution since, apart from the documents mentioned above, there is little evidence available here to support any such hopes.H.H.Colonial Office, S.W.1.21st August, 1953.African morale is directly affected by (a) fluctuationof the battle;   (b) degree of visible protection;   (c). terroristincidents in neighbourhood.   Oath administration is still being carried out,though outside the Xikuyu it has only made limited progress among theMeru and Embu tribes.   Both European and native morale has receiveda setback from the judgment in the Kenyatta appeal.8.      Remedial Measures(1) Rapid expansion of the Police Force:  a recruiting campaign for afurther 450 Assistant Inspectors of Police has been opened.   If the campaigngoes as well as possible, the new appointments may be completed by December,(2) The Governor and General Erskine are considering additionaladministrative measures to cut terrorist food and other supplies,(3) An extended campaign of &quot;psychological warfare&quot; is planned to winover the vast mass of the Kikuyu tribe and counter the breeding ground ofMau ivlau.9.   ConclusionMeanwhile General Erskine must have the means to maintain the offensive against the gangs.   Until the expanded Police Force is ready totake over in the New Year, all five King&apos;s African Rifle Battalions remainlargely committed to a Police role.   Ke therefore requires reinforcements to fill this gap and estimates they will be required for a minimum of seven months from the date of their arrival in Kenya,10.     His present forces are:-3 British Battalions5 King&apos;s African Rifle   BattalionsThe Kenya RegimentThe East African Armoured Car SquadronThe East African Heavy Anti-Aircraft BatteryKe has asked for a complete infantry brigade of 3 battalions with brigade headquarters and appropriate administrative backing.11.
