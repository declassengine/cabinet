-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERT-Y OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).secret.(53) 201 COPY NO. .20TH JULY, 1953CABINETCOMPETITIVE TELEVISION policy memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe Chancellor of the Exchequer stated on 9th July (C.C.(53) 41stConclusions, Minute 3) that &quot;the Cabinet should consider before the summer recess .......the general line to be adopted in the further White Paper whichwas to be presented in the autumn&quot;.    I welcome the proposal that a decision should be taken now on the type of scheme which the Government is preparedto put forward, as it will avoid much research in unprofitable directions in myDepartment.2.        The outstanding new fact which emerges from the report of the television Advisory Committee is that for a number of years there is roomonly for one more national network.    Given the limitation of frequencieslikely to be available at present or in the near future, there would seem to befive main possibilities:-(a) A single private company operating a chain of half a dozenor so high-power stations covering the most populousparts of the country.    This would in effect be a privatemonopoly in advertising on television and since our case is, in the main, based on disapproval of monopoly,I think we must discard this possibility.(b) A number of low-power stations in separate ownership.This looks attractive, but our advertisers, unlike the americans, are used to a national press and would notbe interested in local coverage.    This, taken togetherwith the expense and difficulty of providing localprogrammes, would mean that the operators would be driven increasingly to having national &quot;hook-ups&quot;.The main prospective operators are already talking about the sort of financial association that would be desirable forthis.    Thus, even if we chose (b) because we disliked (a)and the stations started under clearly separate finance andcontrol, we should, in practice, inevitably be driven to allowing a system which would, in fact, be that describedunder (a).    It would, admittedly, be possible to license two new stations in each of a limited number of areas, providedthat their range was restricted so as to prevent mutualinterference; but this would be even more unattractivecommercially to both advertisers and operators.    Onlyviewers in a few chosen populous areas could receivesuch a service and this could hardly be claimed as giving an alternative programme to the bulk of the country, or as really breaking the B.B.C. monopoly.
(c) A new public utility corporation like the B.B.C. and financedout of licences.    This would silence a good many of ourcritics under (a) and (b), but might require a licence feeof  5&quot; 6 (say  3 for the B.B.C. and possibly another 2- 3 for the new corporation).    A sum of this sizewould probably provoke widespread licence evasion, andit would be difficult to apportion licence revenue betweenthe two corporations.(d) A public utility corporation which would be responsible forprogrammes but finance itself from advertisements oftrade, industry and commerce, at least 85 per cent ofwhich is in the hands of private enterprise.    This is avariant of the schemes at present in force in Australiaand New Zealand.(e) Drop the idea of competitive television altogether.3.        The recent public controversy, and discussions in the Cabinet, haverevealed three objections to schemes (a) and (b).(i)    Competitive television which is based upon the self-interestof sponsor advertisers is opposed on moral groundsby many of the best elements in our party and by aninfluential section of public opinion throughout thecountry.(ii)   Either scheme would leave us with the very difficult problem of how to deal with politics and religion,and this might mean that the element of competition which we desire would tend to be restricted to pureentertainment and would exclude much that isvaluable in the field of ideas.(iii)    We should have to set up and maintain a rigoroussystem of control, far beyond anything which has ever been envisaged in the past in a comparablefield, and the very severity of this control mightwell deter investment of private capital on anadequate scale.4.        The more I think about all this, the more it seems that our finalchoice must lie between (d) and (e)    I am given to understand that the 1922Committee might be brought round to (d) as being the only practicable alternative in the present state of feeling in the country.    It might not satisfyour extreme opponents or console the press for the loss of advertising revenue;but it should remove much of the &quot;moral&quot; opposition from the Lords, the Churchand the Universities, and it might even divide the Socialists.    Whether or not we all like the idea, of advertisements with our television pro grammes, thereis a fundamental distinction between this and sponsoring, i. e. the control of programmes by the advertiser.    The distinction would be all the moreemphasized if the control of the programmes were in the hands of a public corporation.5.       A scheme on the lines of (d) could be started in quite a small way with, say, two or three stations at the most.    It would solve the immediate problem of limited frequencies but would not preclude further developments
such as (a) and (b) when additional frequencies, including the large number inbands IV and V, became available for exploitation.    It would save the need fora great number of the irksome restrictions that v/e have hitherto had tovisualise, including the forbidding of religion and politics.    It would alsosave us from the by no means easy task of deciding, in view of the presentlimited frequencies, who amongst very many applicants should be granted aprivileged place on the air for advertising purposes.    Finally, if and whenthe scheme proved to be profitable, it might be possible to provide, on the analogy of the Race Course Betting Control Board, for part of any profits tobe used for cultural purposes, either directly through the Arts Council or through some other such machinery.6.        To sum up, I think the idea of a public corporation financed by advert-ising has a real chance of being accepted widely and might even give us apolitical success.    It would make a start in giving variety of programmes, inthe sense that the second programme would be provided by a new public corporation dependent in the main for its revenue on private enterprise.    Itwould, at the same time, keep in public hands control of this great power overthe mind and this would, I feel, go a long way to satisfy those who are opposedto &quot;sponsoring&quot;.7.        Although I put this scheme forward primarily because it steers a coursebetween the political difficulties involved in. schemes (a) and. (b) on the one handand scheme (e) on the other, it has, in fact, a great deal to be said for it on its merits.    I hope, therefore, my colleagues will agree that I should prepare myWhite Paper with this final end in view although I should, of course, have toexamine and discuss the other proposals.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.20TH JULY, 1953.
