(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y-&apos;S- GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 214 COPY NO. V V24EI JULY.   1955CABINETWAVE RLE Y COMMITTEE report memorandum by the Paymaster-General.My colleagues will now have seen the Report by Lord v7averley&apos;sCommittee (C. (53) 208).2.       It will be recalled that theCabinet on 14th January, 1953 (C.C.(53) 2ndConclusions, Minute 9):-&quot;(1) Agreed in principle that responsibility for atomic research and production should be transferred from the Ministry of supply to an appropriate form of non^departmental organisation.(2) Agreed that a small body of experts should be appointed to devise means of effecting this transfer. &quot;3.       The Committee have now prepared detailed proposals for the transfer.It is inevitable that these proposals should not meet in detail the views of all those who are concerned with this matter.   But, after such a thorough and impartial enquiry by such a very strong Committee, I would not presume(nor would it, I think, be useful) to raise points which I might have liked to seedecided otherwise.   The Report forms an organic whole and it would, it seemsto me, be very difficult to change or modify it without destroying the balance.4.      I hope therefore that the Cabinet will adopt the Report and will authorisethe putting in hand of the necessary preparatory work during the recess.   TheGovernments decision would then be announced in the form of a White Paperwhen Parliament re-assembles.Paymaster-General!s Office, S.W.1.24th July, 1953.
