It will be noted that in paragraph IV of the redraft I have selectedthe second of the three alternative texts in the French draft.

REPLY TO SOVIET NOTESUnited Kingdom Re-draft of August 24Her Majesty&apos;s Government in their customary close consultation with theGovernments of France and of the.United States, have carefully studied the SovietGovernmenfs Notes of August 4 and 15, 1953, which were in reply to the proposalspresented on July 15 by the three Western Powers. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave no intention once again to refute the Soviet Governmenfs criticisms of thepolicy followed by the Three Powers nor of thus prolonging a sterile discussion which can only be harmful to the cause of peace.Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore fully reserve their position in regard tothe various allegations in the Soviet Governmenfs Notes of August 4 and 15 andwill confine their comments to the problems of an urgent nature which arise inconnexion with the meeting of the Foreign Ministers proposed in their Note ofJuly 15. &quot;II. Real progress towards peace and towards a lessening of international tension would be achieved were it possible to find an early solution of some of theexisting problems concerning Germany and to conclude the Austrian State Treaty.It  therefore appears desirable that the meeting of the Foreign Ministers(1) firstshould (2) immediately devote itself to these problems, whereas(3) nowto attempt to discuss at this stage a series of other complex questions, as proposedby the Soviet Government, could only delay and prejudice the success of the talks.Her Majesty&apos;s Government also wish to point out that the study of these other questions has already been entrusted to such international organisations as theUnited Nations or to international bodies such as the Political Conference on Koreawhere the Chinese People&apos;s Republic will be represented. The latter&apos;s participation in the proposed meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers sharingresponsibilities in regard to Germany could not therefore be justified.III. The Soviet Government have suggested a procedure for dealing with theGerman problem which appears complicated, and work on such a basis could, at best, only be long drawn out. The proposals in the Soviet Governmenfs Note ofAugust 15 could only result in postponing to some indeterminate date the holding of free elections in the Federal Republic, in the Eastern Zone of Germany and inBerlin. Yet the problem of free elections is the key to any German settlement.A German Government which is not based on the will of the people as expressedin general elections would not in any way be qualified to take vital decisions affecting the future of the German nation. No peace treaty can be preparedwithout the participation of a German Government representative of the opinionof a reunified Germany.Furthermore, it must be pointed out that when Her Majesty&apos;s government proposed in their Note of July 15 that the problem of free elections be consideredfirst they did not make any prior condition that an investigating commission beestablished. It seems therefore that on this point the Soviet Government havemisinterpreted the terms of this Note.IV. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider is desirable that the Meeting of theForeign Ministers should concentrate on the German problem and in thefirst instance on the question of free elections and the status of the future GermanGovernment, but this need not preclude the Foreign Ministers from discussing all aspects of the problem of German unity nor even from considering the general principles of a German Peace Treaty.V. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have never considered that the re-establish-ment of the freedom and independence of Austria, which, by the terms of the moscow Declaration of November 1953, must be regarded as a liberated country,should be dependent upon progress towards a solution of the German problem.They consider that these two problems are quite distinct. In their view nothing should now prevent the conclusion of an Austrian Treaty. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment therefore trust that, as a result of the meeting of Deputies which is now taking place in London, the Foreign Ministers will finally be able to agree uponthe Austrian State Treaty.
VI. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that progress is more likely tobe made by discussion of these problems than by a further exchange of Notes.Consequently they renew their invitation to the Soviet Government to participate in a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers which could take place on..................at........................   They understand that this would be agreeable to the swiss government.N.B. The last sentence of paragraph V may need amendment in the light:of events.PARIS TELEGRAM No. 304Sir O. HarveyAugust 22, 1953At its second meeting to-day the Drafting Committee, having agreed to work onthe basis of the French redraft in my telegram under reference, decided to refer to governments the revised draft, of which the agreed Anglo-American English textis contained in my immediately following telegram. This draft is agreed, exceptfor passages in square brackets.2. The only serious divergence arose over extending the discussion beyondGermany and Austria. The Americans said that since the committee began workthey had again received explicit instructions that the meeting must be confined toGermany and Austria. They therefore asked for the omission of the words &quot; inthe first instance &quot; in paragraph II (which the French, like us, wished to keep), andwould not agree to the inclusion of anything which might imply willingness to go beyond discussion of Germany and Austria. They objected that the second sentence of paragraph IV was obscure and did not make it clear whether or not discussionof subjects other than Germany and Austria was, in fact, contemplated. Theyargued that it would be dangerous to include in our reply any wording on the precise meaning of which the Three Powers were not entirely agreed.3. The French admitted that the meaning of this sentence was not entirelyclear. In their efforts to devise some wording which might go some way to meetHer Majesty&apos;s Government^ point (and which, they stressed, had not yet beenapproved by Bidault), they had found some obscurity unavoidable We said that wemust still ask for inclusion of wording on the lines of the last sentence of para-graph II of our draft. Both the French and Americans repeated that they couldnot accept this.4. On the other hand, the Americans supported us strongly in urging that weshould include words showing that we did not insist that discussion of Germanquestions should be confined to free elections and formation of all-GermanGovernment. They argued that the Russians were on the defensive over Germanyand that it was to our interest to show that we were prepared to discuss all aspectsof German question, including general principles of the Peace Treaty. The Frenchsaid that they had no authority to accept any such wording, which went beyond what had been previously contemplated. Their conception was that the proposed meeting should be a clearly defined first.stage restricted to discussion of free elections and formation of all-German Government. They said that they would have to seek instructions on the point, but left us with the impression that they wouldprobably give way on it.5. It was, therefore, agreed to submit to Governments three separate texts of paragraph IV.6. The French repeated that Bidauit attached special importance to making some reference to the Investigating Commission. They claimed to have Canadiansupport on this point and argued that press comment after the Washington meetingmust have made it clear to the Russians that we had abandoned the Commission.We said that Her Majesty&apos;s Government did not consider that any final decisionhad been taken on the point at Washington and that it would be better to keep it asa concession to be made at the proposed meeting. We therefore suggested omission of second sub-paragraph of paragraph III. The Americans agreed with us, butindicated that they would not press their objection to it if the French attached .special importance to keeping it.
7. The Committee will meet again on the morning of August 25. We shouldbe grateful for instructions by then, particularly on the question of general review on which, on our present instructions, agreement in Committee seems impossible.PARIS TELEGRAM No. 305Sir O. HarveyAugust 22, 1953My immediately preceding telegram.Following is text:  [Begins]Her Majesty&apos;s Government in their customary close consultation with theGovernments of France and of the United States, have carefully studied the SovietGovernmenfs Notes of August 4 and 15, 1953, which were in reply to the proposalspresented on July 15 by the three Western Powers. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave no intention of refuting once again the Soviet Governmenfs criticisms of thepolicy followed by the three Powers nor of thus prolonging a sterile discussion which can only be harmful to the cause of peace.Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore fully reserve their position in regard tothe various allegations in the Soviet Governmenfs Notes of August 4 and 15 andwill confine their comments to the problems of an urgent nature which arise inconnexion with the meeting of the Foreign Ministers proposed in their Note ofJuly 15.II. Real progress towards peace and towards a lessening of international tension would be achieved were it possible to find an early solution of some of theexisting problems concerning Germany and to conclude the Austrian State Treaty.It therefore appears desirable that the meeting of the Foreign Ministers shoulddevote itself to these problems [United Kingdom, France: in the first instance];whereas to inject into the discussion a series of other complex questions, asproposed by the Soviet Government, could only delay and prejudice the success ofthe talks. Her Majesty&apos;s Government also wish to point out that the study ofthese other questions has already been entrusted to such international organisationsas the United Nations or to international bodies such as the Political Conferenceon Korea where the Chinese Peopled Republic will be represented. The latter&apos;sparticipation in the proposed meeting of the Foreign Ministers could not thereforebe justified in any way.III. As regards the manner in which the German problem should be approached the Soviet Government have put forward a procedure which. appearscomplicated and whose execution could, at best, only be long drawn out. TheSoviet Governmenfs Note of August 15 envisages in effect a series of devices whichwould result in postponing to some indeterminate date the holding of free elections .in the Federal Republic, in the Eastern Zone of Germany and in Berlin. Yet theproblem of free elections is the key to any German settlement. A German Govern-ment which is not based on the will of the people as expressed in general electionswould not in any way be qualified to take vital decisions affecting the future of theGerman nation. No peace treaty can be valid which is prepared without the participation of a German Government representative of the opinion of a reunifiedGermany.Furthermore it must be pointed out that when Her Majesty&apos;s government proposed in their Note of July 15 that the problem of free elections be consideredfirst they did not make any prior condition that an investigating commission beestablished. It seems therefore that on this point the Soviet Government havemisinterpreted the terms of this Note.IV. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider it desirable that the Conference ofthe Foreign Ministers should concentrate on the German problem and in the firstinstance on the question of free elections and the status of the future GermanGovernment. [France: however they would not object if, with a view to preparing
and accelerating subsequent negotiations, the Ministers were to discuss in a pre-liminary way all other questions which they agreed by common consent could be studied profitably and in the interests of the solution of the German problem itself .1[United Kingdom, United States: but this need not preclude the Foreign ministers from discussing all aspects of the problem of German unity nor even from con-sidering the general principles of a German Peace Treaty.] [United Kingdom: atthe same time Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to join in a general review by the Ministers of the world situation in broad terms.]V. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have never considered that the re-establish-ment of the freedom and independence of Austria, which, by the terms of the moscow Declaration of November 1943, must be regarded a liberated country,should be dependent upon progress towards a solution of the German problem.They consider that these two problems are quite distinct. In their view nothing should now prevent the conclusion of an Austrian Treaty. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment therefore trust that, as a result of the meeting of deputies which is now takingplace in London, the Foreign Ministers will finally be able to agree upon theAustrian State Treaty.VI. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that progress is more likely tobe made by discussion of these problems than by a further exchange of Notes.Consequently they renew their invitation to the Soviet Government to participate in a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers which could take place on..................at............................ They understand that this would be agreeable to the swiss government.[Ends]2.   Last sentence of paragraph V may need amendment in the light of events.
