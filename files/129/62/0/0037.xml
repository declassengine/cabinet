Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1953SECRETCopy No.C. (53) 237&apos;&apos;20th August, 1953.CABINETTARIFF POLICY: NO-NEW-PREFERENCE RULEMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 9th July the Cabinet agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington should be instructed to try to secure American support for a waiver of the &quot;no-new-preference&quot; rule under the General Agreement, on Tariffs andTrade (G.A.T.T.) by offering, in addition to the concessions already proposed, to exclude from the waiver goods which were charged for duty under the ottawa agreements Act (C.C. (53) 41st Conclusions, Minute 7). This offer was duly madeto the Americans, but it did not achieve its purpose. The Americans suggested analternative line of approach, which I authorised officials to discuss with them,without commitment. I have now carefully examined the American proposals inthe light of these discussions; I believe that they show a clear desire to try to help us and I recommend that we accept them on the basis discussed in,this paper.2. The new line of approach envisages a general waiver applicable to all goods for which we have not until now made any tariff concession to &quot;bind&quot; existing rates of duty. The waiver would require us in any given case to consult withother foreign countries interested in the item affected as to the risk, if any, thatan increase in the margin of preference might lead to a substantial, diversion oftrade from these countries to Commonwealth sources of supply. Provided that itwas agreed that there was no risk of any substantial diversion of trade, the waiverwould apply automatically. Where this was not agreed, we should be entitled to seek the arbitration of disinterested contracting parties in the G.A.T.T.; and, if the arbitration went against us, we should not be able to proceed under the generalwaiver. In these circumstances we should have to seek an individual waiver toallow us to increase the preference in question notwithstanding the risk of a sub-stantial diversion of trade. It would be open to us to go ahead without this waiverif in critical circumstances we judged this to be necessary in order to repair orprevent serious injury to our domestic producers; in this event, however, foreigncountries would be free, to the extent that they actually suffered from such diversion of trade, to retaliate against us and to do so without having to seek prior approval in the G.A.T.T.3.   The two main points of difficulty about this proposal are: -(a) the limitation to items for which we have not as at this date &quot; bound &quot;the rates of duty;(b) the qualifications upon our ultimate freedom in any cases where there isjudged to be risk of substantial diversion of trade.4. The first limitation would become of practical importance only when webecame free, under Article XXVIII of the G.A.T.T., to renegotiate duties whichare presently &quot; bound.&quot; Under present arrangements in the G.A.T.T., we andall other contracting parties are due to recover this freedom as from 1st January,1954, and the Economic Policy Committee have agreed that there would be advantage in letting the present time bar lapse at this date. From further dis-cussions that we have now had with the Americans, and also with the Canadians,44706
I am convinced that the risks:%v,,our owri1-expbrters^lhtere^sts from protectionistpressures in the United States, and to some extent in Canada, if these countries areenabled once again to negotiate for an increase in their &quot; bound &quot; tariffs, wouldbe much -greater than I had previously thought. I am therefore now of. opinionthat \v8&apos;;should, in our own interest, join hands with the American and Canadian,Governments in sponsoring an extension of the time bar for a further,twelve or.eighteen months and thus help the Americans to hold the line while they reView5their commercial policies. Assuming, as. is extremely probable; ?th,atVithjs.. policy;will be accepted in the G.A.T.T., we have no immediate interest in extending theproposed waiver in relation to the no-new-preference rule to duties which are atpresent &quot; bound &quot; against increase; and, on this assumption, I think we need notbe too troubled about this point, provided always that we make it clear in theG.A.T.T. -and the Americans already understand this that we are reserving our right to reopen the question of the application of the waiver to presently &quot; bound &quot;items when this becomes a practical issue.5. As regards the qualifications upon our ultimate freedom to act in caseswhere there is judged to be risk that an increase of preference would lead to asubstantial diversion of trade, these are qualifications which, in one form or another, it is now clear that we must accept under any solution which the americans-and consequently the European countries &quot;would accept for their part. I am now satisfied that if we can get general agreement to the presentformula, we shall have.done as well as can be expected.6. A solution on these lines will nevertheless not be easy to defend. Thisis inevitably the case for any solution that is consistent with the basic concept ofthe no-new-preference rule. With this in mind we have made it clear to the americans that our ability to defend it will depend very much on our being ableto show that it will work smoothly and satisfactorily. I have said that I regard it as essential that I should be able to announce the implementation of our decisions on the outstanding horticultural applications at the same time as I announceacceptance of the waiver formula. Of the horticultural items on which we want to move this year all, with one possible exception, should give rise to no difficultyunder the proposed procedure. The one possible exception dried peas is an item on which we face the risk of argument with other countries under any solutionlikely to be generally acceptable.7. I am satisfied that we have now explored the limits of the United States&apos;ability to help. I have considered whether it would be preferable to reserve ourposition on the whole matter pending a general review of the G.A.T.T. The chances of thus getting anything better are highly speculative, and I see some advantage from the domestic standpoint in getting now the very substantial degree of freedomthe present proposal would give us. With the generous efforts the Americans havemade to meet us, it would be neither reasonable nor in our own interest to have a break with them on this issue at a time when their Administration is undoubtedlymaking real efforts to develop more liberal trading policies. I therefore recommendthat I should be authorised to agree to a solution on the basis described in this paper. t^d/so m v .-8. If my colleagues agree, I would wish to inform other commonwealth countries at once of the nature of the solution which we now have in sight for theno-new-preference rule and of the policy we propose, and the reasons for it, inrelation to the extension of the time bar &quot;for negotiations under Article XXVIII ofthe G.A.T.T.x biii/od &quot; aiiiS ?;m ta 3 ..
