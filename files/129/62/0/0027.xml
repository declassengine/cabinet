to 3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER britannic MAJESTY-rS GOVERNMENT)S E 0 R E T0.(53)227 .SUEZ CANAL;    FREEDOM OF NAVIGATIONMemorandum by the Lord PresidentMy colleagues will recall that they decided inJuly 1952 (0.0.(52)75*13. Conclusions Minute 3)  to approach the French Government, and later the Governments of the othermain Maritime Powers $ with a view to a meeting at which:(i)   we would consider a joint approach, tothe Egyptian Government in order toobtain firmer guarantees regardingfreedom of navigation of the Suez Canaljand(ii)   we would explore the possibilities of joint action, in the event of failure by theEgyptian Government to give such guaranteesor to maintain freedom of navigation andto safeguard the Suez Canal Company.2.       Secret discussions with the French took place at official level in September, 1952, when broad agreement was reached between us on the basic principles involved.     The FrenchGovernment, however, considered that no approach to the otherMaritime Powers would be effective unless we first made sure of the participation of the United States Government in the talks.     Accordingly an approach was made by the British andFrench Ambassadors in Washington on 29th January suggestingtripartite talks.     After first declining, the United StatesGovernment consented, provided that the talks were held inutmost secrecy and wore of an exploratory nature.     They were held, again at the official level, in Washington from20th July to 29th July.3.       It became apparent at these talks that the United StatesGovernment were unwilling to take part in the wider- conferenceof Maritime Powers which we and the French advocated with aview to considering either a multilateral approach to Egyptor any other joint action by the Powers to safeguard their rights.     This attitude appeared to be based upon a firmlyheld conviction that the course of action proposed would provoke violent reactions on the part of the Egyptians, if theygot to hear of it, and perhaps increase the dangers which it was designed to meet.     It was also felt that the Egyptians would react sharply against joining a multilateral declaration suchas the United Kingdom and French delegations proposed.The United States Government were also evidently most unwilling,as they have been over our defence negotiations with Egypt, toaccept advance commitments which might involve them in actionjointly v/ith us in opposition to the Egyptian Government,While no reference was made to the Panama Canal, our delegationsuspected that considerations relating to this waterway may have played some part in determining their attitude.COPY NO.      / /CABINET
ii.       The United States Government&apos;s proposal was that an approach should bo made to the Egyptian Government in Cairoby a single Ambassador at a time whan it appeared that    our defence negotiations would result in a settlement and thatthe Egyptian Government should be asked to issue a unilateral declaration reaffirming the principle of freedom&apos;of navigationin the Canal,     Whan such a statement was issued, it would bepossible for the Maritime Powers to take cognizance of it.If the Egyptian Government rofusad to issue a declaration,the United States Government would prefer in presentcircumstances to 1st tho matter rest,5.       I do not think that wa should accept this american proposal even if, as is not the case, the terms of the proposed declaration v/ere satisfactory, since:-(i)   A unilateral declaration volunteeredby Egypt, and noted by other Powers,would be loss binding&apos;than a joint declaration by the Maritime countries with which Egypt was associated.Given Egypt&apos;s slight regard for herearlier declarations on this subject,it would inspire no public confidence,(ii)    If the U.S. Ambassador in Cairo were toput it forward, which is&apos;probably whatthe Americans would like, we and theFrench would lose control and might be under embarrassing pressure to acceptmodifications which the egyptians would suggest.(iii)   Having accepted the proposal, we shouldbe handicapped in our approaches to the maritime Powers, notably in our efforts to organise joint action in tho eventof trouble in Egypt involving navigationof the Canal.(iv)    There v;ould be political criticism heroand in tho Commonwealth if we allowed a Government not so vitally dependentas ourselves on this Canal to makethe running.(v)   To leave an approach to Egypt until thodefence talks are on the way to asettlement would be too late.6.       There is a danger that with all this delay, wo may reach a settlement with Egypt on defence issues which would commitus to withdrawing our combatant troops from the Suez Canal Zonewithout any safeguard whatever for tho freedom of navigationin this international waterway.     The Foreign Secretary hasalways been reluctant to complicate our already complexdefence negotiations by intruding this issue, which we have always thought susceptible to a multilateral rather than a bilateral approach;    and I share his view.     Nevertheless, ifit proves impossible to secure an effective multilateralapproach in time, - and the prospects of this are not hopefulI should see no alternative but to try to secure an Egyptianreaffirmation regarding freedom of transit and safeguarding the Suez Canal Company as part of tho instrument of settlement.
logR e c omme agenda ti ons7.       The French Government have not decided what to do and Ihave reason to believe that they will be influenced by our views.       I suggest therefore that wo should take the followingcourse:-(a) We should concert policy with theFrench Government.(b) We should instruct H.M. ambassador at Washington to approach theUnited States Government again atthe highest lovely together with hisFrench colleague.     They shouldrestate the great importance and soopeof the interests involved, pointing out the especial vulnerability of theUnited Kingdom, the Commonwealth andthe French Union in the event ofinterruption of traffic.     They would go on to give the reasons why we considered the United States proposalinadequate.     Sir Roger Makins shouldmake a further effort to convinceMr. Dulles that the multilateral approach is the right one and&apos;should say that,without such a basis, we should see no alternative but to bring freedom of navigation within the scope of theAnglo/1 gyptian defence settlement.(c) We should also have to make it clear that,if the United States Government wouldnot associate themselves with us, theUnited Kingdom and France would consider themselves free to make secret approachess to&apos;the other interested Maritime Powers.We, for our part, would similarly want to consult the other commonwealth countries on the principle that we are under an obligation to do so with thetermination of the Anglo/Egyptian Treatyof 1936, in Article 8 of which the canal is recognised as being &quot;as essentialmeans of communication between thedifferent parts of the British Empire&quot;.8.       At the same time, I recommend that instructions shouldbe drafted for the use of our delegation in Cairo against the eventuality of their having to raise this subject with the egyptians in the context of the defence settlement.9.       I should be grateful for my colleagues * views, and inparticular, those of the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, on whether our consultation under paragraph 7 (b)above should include India and Pakistan and Ceylon, or be confined to the old Commonwealth Governments, which are already in the picture regarding our talks with the French and united States Governments.a,Foreign Office, S.W.1.7TH AUGUST, 1953.
