secret.(53) 2226TH AUGUST, 1953COPY NO.CABINETMAN-POWER FOR CIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES IN war memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service in accordance with the conclusions of the Defence Committee(D. (52) 5th Meeting, Item 2) a Ministerial Committee under my Chairmanshipwas appointed (i) to estimate the numbers of whole-time men needed by thepolice and civil defence services in the first year of war,   and (ii) to recommenda scheme for meeting this need.2.        The major problem,and the most difficult, is to meet the needs of the fire service and the civil defence corps which are estimated to require something of the order of 300,000 additional men.    The police forces will require over60,000 more, and there are other demands on a smaller scale for other services.We have not explicitly approved these estimates but they give an indication of the size of the problem.    In this memorandum I deal only with the needs of the fire service and civil defence corps.3.        We have had before us a number of suggestions from a working party of officials as to possible means of providing the numbers required.    The main proposals made were:&quot;(a)    That there should be a high level appeal for volunteers and a Ministerial campaign to obtain them.(b) That, as (a) could not be expected to meet the full need,a scheme of compulsory enrolment for training inpeace-time for whole-time service in war-time should be introduced.(c) That power should be taken to allocate some 25,000 menfrom the R. A. F. National Service Reserve to civil defence training in 1954, and comparable numbers inthe next few years.    These are men who, whilerequired by the R.A. F. for their full two yearColour Service, would not be required for R. A. F.duties during the first twelve months of a war, but would be required later on.    They are not mean-while being called on for annual reserve training.4.        We have rejected the suggestions in 3(a) and (b) above because we feelthat a high level appeal for volunteers would be most inappropriate in thepresent international situation and because we are satisfied that compulsoryenrolment of civilians for training in peace-time would not be politicallypracticable.-1-
5.     This leaves only the third proposal - to make use of R. A. F. NationalService reservists who are temporarily surplus to mobilisation requirements.This could only be done without legislation if the R.A. F. themselves were tocall these men up and give them civil defence training.    This would no doubt be administratively inconvenient for the Home Office.    Moreover, as the full14 days&apos; training would be taken up in learning fire fighting and heavy rescueduties, it would be impossible to pretend that these reservists were receivingR.A. F. refresher training and the real object could not be concealed.6.     To transfer these men to the Home Office for training in civil defenceinstead of R. A. F. reserve training would undoubtedly need legislation.    It hasbeen suggested that the necessary legal powers might be obtained by theinclusion of a clause in the draft Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves Bill,which it is proposed to introduce in Parliament at the beginning of the new session.    The Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers are opposed tothis proposal.    They are advised that to do this would unduly enlarge the scopeof that Bill and would be likely to make its passage through the House muchmore controversial.    The Bill, as now drafted, is devised inter alia to attach a continued liability to recall in a grave emergency to National Servicereservists on completion of their 5f years&apos; Colour and Reserve Service underthe 1948 National Service Act: that is, after they have passed beyond the opera-tion of that Act.    A measure designed to enable National Service reservistsof the Forces to be trained in civil defence duties during the currency of their5f years1 liability under the National Service Act might well be held byParliament to be more appropriately dealt with by an amendment of that Act,rather than by provision in a Bill dealing with such reservists after they have completed their service under the National Service Act.    Indeed, if the scopeof the proposed Reserves Bill were enlarged by such provision, it might wellmean that amendments of the most far-reaching kind, for example proposingreductions in the present period of National Service, would be ruled in orderin debate on the Bill.    Apart from this consideration, Service Ministers are opposed to the inclusion of this provision in the Reserves Bill, because of thehandle it would probably afford to the critics of National Service in claiming that the fact that the R.A. F. has reservists surplus to its requirements in theearly months of war implies that too many men are called up to the forces under the National Service Act.    A similar objection might well be made toany proposal for a separate Bill confined to this particular question of trainingsurplus R.A. F. reservists in civil defence duties.7.     If this proposal is to be dropped, the result will be that nothing of any real value will be done to provide the civil defence corps with trained reservesfor whole-time service at the outbreak of a war.    It might be possible to defer the proposal until after the passage of the Navy, Army and Air ForceReserves Bill and then to consider again the chances of introducing thenecessary legislation without opening the way to dangerous criticism of theNational Service Act.    But that would mean that the Home Office would notbe able to begin earmarking and training any civil defence reserve muchbefore 1955.8.     We have, therefore, to consider:-(a)    Whether we should face the difficulties of introducing legislation in the autumn either in the Navy, Armyand Air Force Reserves Bill, or in a separate Bill,to make 25,000 men from the R.A. F. NationalService Reserve available for civil defence training.
(b) Whether we should defer consideration of thisproposal until after the passage of the Navy,Army and Air Force Reserves Bill.(c) What other measures we could take which might atleast partially meet the grave need for trainedcivil defence reserves.W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S. W.l.6TH AUGUST, 1953.
