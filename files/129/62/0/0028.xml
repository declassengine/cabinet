ISRAEL AND MIDDLE EAST DEFENCE:  discussions with THE AMERICANSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilOn 6th May, the Defence Committee recommended that, before under-taking further negotiations with Israel, we should hold secret discussions withthe United States  and try to secure their support for our policy (D. (53) 8th Meet-ing, Item 3).2. The Defence Committee:-(i)   Agreed that our aim should be to help Israel build up herarmed strength, not only for her own defence, but also as a contribution to a settled situation in the middle east.(ii)   Invited the Minister of State, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to arrange for this policy to be explained to the United States Government and to seektheir support in providing the arms and equipment thatX&apos;   Israel would require.3, The attached draft despatch, instructing H. M. Ambassador atWashington to approach the United States Government, has accordingly beenprepared by the Foreign Office, in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff.    Owingto vacation arrangements, the Defence Committee is not at present meeting,and I should, therefore, be glad to have the views of my colleagues in the Cabineton this draft.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.7TH AUGUST, 1953.DRAFT DESPATCH TO H.M. AMBASSADOR AT WASHINGTONHer Majesty&apos;s Government have for some time had under considera-tion how the desire of the Israel Government for close military co-operationwith the West can be fitted into Allied plans for the defence of the Middle Eastagainst Soviet aggression.    In response to an approach by the Israel(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 228 COPY NO._fj7TH AUGUST, 1953CABINET
Government, they despatched an exploratory Military Mission to Israel in theautumn of 1952,    After studying the Mission&apos;s report, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-&quot;ment are considering how to pursue the matter with the Israel Government;  but before doing so they wish to reach agreement with the United States government about the policy to be adopted.2. The defence of the Middle East, as far to the North and East aspossible, will require facilities in Israel both in peace and in war.    The extentof these facilities will depend on the outcome of our present negotiations with egypt. in broad terms we shall need in war the use of road and rail communications, ports and airfields in Israel, a requirement which may entailsome development in peace. We shall also need facilities in peace for the storage of oil and possibly of equipment in Israel, and for the development inwar of a maintenance area, including the provision of accommodation, labourand transport vehicles. Should we fail to obtain the base facilities which we require in Egypt, our requirements in Israel - both in peace and in war- will undoubtedly need further consideration.3. We also hope that Israel&apos;s armed forces, which have already provedtheir fighting value, could be developed and used in such a way as to meet theneeds of Allied strategy for the whole Middle East area,4. It must be recognised, however, that any arrangements with Israel onthe foregoing lines would, unless most carefully handled, run the risk of alien-ating the neighbouring Arab States.    The co-operation of these Arab States,both in providing facilities for Allied troops and in building up their own forces,remains indispensable to any plans for the defence of the Middle East.    any arrangements with Israel must, therefore, be such as to evoke the minimum of hostility from the Arab States.5. While there is no doubt that the Israel Government are, in principle,ready to make the contribution we hope for, they will require certain help andwill have certain particular ideas and objectives of their own.    They could not,without outside help, finance the extensive capital investment required for theimprovement of their communications and the establishment of workshops andother facilities:  and they will seek to include in the programme items which are primarily of economic and not of strategic importance.    They will, naturally,wish to seize the opportunity further to improve their own armed forces and inso doing their motive will be as much to make themselves more powerful inrelation to their Arab neighbours as to provide against a possible Soviet attack.Finally, they will expect to be taken into the confidence of the Allies about thelatter&apos;s plans for the defence of the Middle East.6. But the Israel Government are in no position to insist on their ownpoint of view where that differs from the plans and wishes of the &quot;Western Powers,upon whom Israel is dependent financially and economically.    Both her internal and foreign exchange budgets   require outside help if they are to be balanced,and she depends on Western sources of supply for the equipment of her armed forces.7. In subsequent discussions of military co-operation with the Israelisit will therefore be our aim to seek the Israel Governments agreement to:-(a)    giving the Allies the facilities they require for thedefence of the Middle East.    Details of thefacilities required cannot be finally defined untilthe outcome of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations is known.
(b)  making available formations for employment outsideIsrael according to plans for the defence of theMiddle East and in the light of political conditionsexisting at the time.8. In return v/e must be prepared to offer :.-(a) to examine the possibility of securing for Israel thefinancial help required to develop such base and other facilities as we consider necessary in preparation forwar, which would not otherwise be provided;(b) to examine sympathetically Israel&apos;s requests for the arms and equipment necessary to enable her to playher correct role;(c) to give an assurance that Israel will be given as muchinformation on the progress of our defence planning forthe area as the other Middle East States.9. We do not wish to dictate to the Israel Government how such resourcesof their own as they can make available for the development of their armed forces should be divided between their navy, army and air force.        We should clearly be running our heads against a brick wall if we actively discouragedthem from their aim, which was declared to the Military Mission, of a balancedforce.  V/e consider, however, that such Western help as can be given for thedevelopment of Israelfs forces should in fact be concentrated mainly on thebuilding up of her air force,   for the following reasons:-(a) the greatest deficiency in the forces available for thedefence of the Middle East is in the air;(b) Israel can provide better technical support for airv        forces than can any other Middle East country;(c) in the event of war with the Soviet Union, the arab countries might be less reluctant to see Israel&apos;sair forces   operating over their territories than herland forces.10. It is desirable that we should concert all major matters of middle east policy with the United States Government, whom we are anxious to committo the defence of that area, and the particular policy outlined in paragraphs 7,8 and 9 above is in any case not one which Her Majesty&apos;s Government could afford to execute alone.    We therefore wish to ascertain whether the UnitedStates Government are broadly in agreement with it.11. Your Excellency should now, therefore, in close co-operation withthe British Joint Staff Mission, approach the United States Government on thelines set forth and discover how far they are in agreement with the policy proposed; and to what extent they would be prepared to assist and support usin it.    It is important that the fact of your discussions should remain a closesecret, even from the Israelis.12. I am aware that the United States Government will not easily be convinced of the necessity for this policy.    They will be reluctant to see theWest identified yet more closely with Israel;   and they may well consider thatthey have already helped, and are helping, that countryfs finances more than
10 Jenough.    To this, our answer must b3 that facilities and communications in Israelwill be a military necessity in case of war and must be prepared beforehand; thatthere is no reason why any arrangement reached with Israel should becomepublic or reach Arab ears;  and that we are not suggesting fresh grants to Israel-but merely that existing and foreseeable future grants should be partly earmarked for the facilities referred to above.13. I am sending copies of this despatch to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atTel Aviv and the Head of the B.M.E.O.
