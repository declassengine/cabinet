Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1953.secret (S3) 22$ 2te)28th July, 1953CABINETWHITE PAPER ON HOUSING policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government attached is my draft White Paper. It is not intended to be final. I shall probably want to make alterations myself. But I would value the opinion of mycolleagues at the present stage.2.   There are three points to which I must call special attention.I. Differences with Scotland3.   I understand that the Secretary of State will be circulating his own draft white Paper.   Two differences have emerged in our proposals.(1) The rent increase4. The Scottish proposal is to allow a 40 per cent, increase on existing rents.For reasons set out in my draft Paper (paragraph 22) a percentage increase is notpossible in England and Wales where existing rents vary widely and quite illogically.I propose an increase related to the statutable deduction for rating purposes. Thisarrangement is not possible in Scotland owing to their different rating system.I think that this difference between the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals and mine is entirely defensible.5. The Scottish proposals represent, I understand, an addition of twice theamount allowed for repairs before the war. Mine (which is to be one and a halftimes the statutable deduction) represents an addition of one and a half times that amount. Repairs are costing about three times what they did; so that the Scottishproposal can be said to be more strictly logical.6. My increase will, however, amount to more than 40 per cent, increaseof the rent in some cases though less in others. Also, expressed as shillings perweek, my increase will in many cases I imagine in most he bigger than theScottish. If I were to bring my increase up to twice the statutable deduction, or ifthe Secretary of State were to reduce his to 33J per cent., we should, therefore, widenour difference in fact if not in logic.7.   I think that on this point our proposals are right as they stand, and canbe defended.(2) Proof of expenditure by the landlord8. A more serious difference arises over my proposal that the rent increaseshall be dependent on proof by the landlord that he has actually spent money on repairs (paragraph 31).9.   The Secretary of State does not feel able to adopt this is Scotland, for thereason, I understand, that Scottish landlords have not spent any money on repairsfor years and will not do so until they have actually got the rent increase.  Their    irents, it seems, have been hopelessly inadequate for years, partly due to theirliability to owners&apos; rates..   44578aCopy No.71
10. The Secretary of State does agree that the house must be in &quot; good andtenantable repair &quot; before the rent may be increased; and might, I understand,agree further to a condition barring the increase where the state of good repairis due to work done by the tenant. So it seems to me that in most cases the Scottishlandlord will have to spend money before he can qualify for a rent increase. How-ever the Secretary of State feels that to insist on proof of this might make the rent increase scheme a dead letter in Scotland.11. In my view it is politically essential to insist on proof of expenditure by the landlord as a condition of rent increase. It will associate the increase inthe tenanfs mind with a benefit received. It will cut out the case where it is thetenant who has kept the house in good repair. -And above all it will stagger the increases, and so reduce the risk of organised rent strikes or mass appeals forcertificates of disrepair.12. The Secretary of State and I are agreed that it would be difficult toexplain a difference between English and Scottish practice on this point. We shall,therefore, need a decision of the Cabinet which it is to be; proof of expenditure by the landlord or not.II.---The Submission of Slum Clearance Programmes (Paragraph 39)13. Local authorities are to be required to submit programmes for the clearing, patching up and replacement of slums. My proposal is to ask for pro-grammes within 12 months of the passing of the Bill, and at regular intervalsthereafter. The question is whether this requirement should go into the Bill or be conveyed to local authorities by Ministerial direction.14. It can be argued, on the one hand, that this process cam be handled moreconveniently and more expeditiously by administrative action, and that even if the requirement is made statutory it will not. help ,the Minister in coercing backwardauthorities since there cannot be any effective penalty attached; on the other hand,that a statutory requirement would bring home more forcibly to local authoritiesand the public that the Government regard this as a task of the highest urgency.Moreover the fact that Parliament had thought it right to make a statutory time-table might be useful to the Ministry and to a local authority&apos;s own constituents in bringing pressure,to bear on a backward authority. - -15.   I have not yet decided which course to recommend./III. The Rents of Council Houses (Paragraph 77)16. Under the present Housing Acts local authorities have complete freedom to fix their rents as they please. Fixed subsidies are paid for any house built bya local authority, whatever its size and quality, and for whatever class of tenant itis designed. The rent normally charged takes the subsidy into account, and theresult is that many Council tenants are getting the benefit of the subsidy who donot need it or who do not need the whole of it.17. There has been much criticism of this system. 1 am therefore considering whether it would be possible to have regard to the true value of the house, grantinga rebate to those in need but only to those in need.18. Since this would, in effect, enforce a &quot; means test &quot;from the centre, insteadof allowing local decisions in the matter, it has great political danger:19. It may, in any event, prove impossible to devise a way of finding the truerental value of their houses until the Inland Revenue have completed revaluationwhich they are at present carrying out for rating purposes. They would not complete this till 1955 or 1956, and even then they will only have found the1939 rental value of the houses.20.   I am giving further study to this problem.       ;. ,&apos; &quot; :i  H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.L.27th July, 1953.
DRAFT WHITE  PAPER  ON  HOUSING  POLICYIntroductionThe housing problem which Her Majesty&apos;s present Government inherited at theend of 1951 has two aspects:  the continuing need to provide new houses for people without a separatehome of their own; andthe condition of existing houses, some of them needing repair or improve-ment, some fit only for demolition.2. Before the war the nation was making good headway in dealing with bothof these problems. New houses and flats were being built at the rate of 300,000a year. Labour and materials were available for repairs and improvements. a campaign for slum clearance and the abatement of gross overcrowding was in fullcareer.In 1939 the national stock of houses and fiats was about equal to the numberof separate families. Only 6 per cent, of the population were living in unfit or over-crowded houses and 30 per cent, were,living in houses built since 1919.3.   This progress was cut short by the war.4. The building of new houses and flats virtually ceased. Repair and main-tenance the first line of defence in housing and therefore in health had perforceto be neglected. Consequently, the condition of large numbers of houses began to deteriorate. Slum clearance and the abatement of gross overcrowding had to be abandoned.5. Between 1939 and 1945 the number of houses built did not exceed 200,000in all. Enemy action entirely destroyed over 225,000 houses; severely damaged afurther 550,000; and damaged in varying degrees a very much larger number.6. The rents of all privately-owned dwellings of a rateable value not exceeding 100 in London,  90 in Scotland and  75 elsewhere, were necessarily brought under control on the outbreak of war (if they were not already controlled). This controlhas not yet been lifted.Post-War Years and the ^Problem before us7. Since the end of the war, and in addition to the repair of war-damagedhouses, successive Governments have devoted most of their energies in the housingfield to building new houses and flats.8. The number of new permanent dwellings built in Great Britain in thevarious years since the war are as follows (in round figures):  1946   ..................       55,00019471948194919501951140,000228,000198,000198,000195,000The full table is in Appendix I.9. During the year 1952, 240,000 new houses and flats were built in GreatBritain. In the first six months of 1953 the number completed was 145,000 odd.The rate of completions is now in the neighbourhood of 300,000 a year which her majesty&apos;s Government adopted as a target.10. The success of the new housing programme enables us now to turn to theproblem of the old houses.11. At the present time there are about 13J million individual dwellings(houses and flats) in Great Britain.   Of these, about 3f million are lived in by owner-occupiers;2\ million are rented from local authorities, New Town Corporations,housing associations, &amp;c.1\ million are rented from private landlords, large and small.
Of the 7^ million houses owned by private landlords over 2  million are 100years old or more; a further 1  million are more than 75 years old; a furtherI million are over 65 years old. These are striking figures and give a measure ofthe problem before us. Some of these houses are in a perfectly good state of repair.Some only minor repairs. Some are in a bad state. Some are obsolescent. Someought to be condemned. For the present we need them all except perhaps the worst. But none ought to be allowed to deteriorate further. For they represent animportant national asset which ought to be preserved. Since by the end of this year the number of dwellings, permanent and temporary, provided since the war in one way or another will have approached two millions we now have elbow room inwhich to turn more to the maintenance, repair and, where necessary, improvementof the old houses, and the demolition and replacement of those in such a condition that they ought to be demolished.12. There have been many allegations that houses are falling down or beingabandoned. To the extent that this may be true it mainly applies to those houses which are really obsolete and cannot be improved or made fit for modern ideas at reasonable cost. It is worth remembering that if there had been no war and slum clearance had proceeded at the rate achieved by 1938 large numbers of these houses would have been pulled down and replaced by now.13. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly prepared a comprehensive plan of repair, maintenance, improvement and demolition which covers all types and conditions of house. It is a Better Housing Campaign. It divides houses intofour classes.(i) The best the great mass of essentially sound houses many of which arein good condition and all of which the landlords would put and keep in good con-dition given a reasonable rent. This in many cases must mean some increase inrent.(ii) The worst the slum houses which ought to be demolished as soon as circumstances permit. Only a proportion can be pulled down and replaced in thenext 5 years. Since the rest must, of necessity, remain in use they should at least be patched up in order to make life more tolerable for their occupants-(iii) An intermediate class the &quot; dilapidated &quot; houses some of which maybe brought into the first class by their owners, others of which local authorities may have to get repaired and made fit for human habitation by greater use of their statutory powers.(iv) Houses which could give years of good service if they were improved that is to say provided with bathrooms, hot water, up-to-date cooking arrangements and other necessary amenities: also houses too big for present-day needs whichcould be converted into flats.The essentially sound houses14. The great bulk of our houses are fortunately either in good condition maintenance and repair having been carried out by the landlords despite rent restriction, and sometimes by the tenants or capable of being put into good con-dition without any very drastic change in the present system. Nevertheless, it isgenerally admitted that the annual cost of repairs which has been rising steadily even to houses in generally good condition can, in many cases, no longer be met outof that part of the rent which is traditionally and by statute earmarked for thepurpose.15. The neglect which privately-owned houses have suffered in recent years is due primarily to two causes. From September 1939 to the end .of last year people were not allowed to carry out repairs exceeding a certain low figure .of cost unless they could get not only a building licence but also licences for controlled materialssuch as timber and steel; and they could get the necessary licences only if they could show that the work was extremely urgent. The only controlled material now istimber, of which supplies are becoming easier. And since the beginning of this yearanyone has been free to spend up to  500 per annum on house repair without a building licence and permission can readily be got to spend more if necessary. so the need for licences is no longer an obstacle.
16.   The other and more serious cause is rent control.  There is at present inEngland and Wales a hopelessly illogical system of rents-(a) There are &quot; old control &quot; rents (i.e., rents first controlled in 1920 or beforeand never decontrolled). These (broadly speaking) are the lowest rents and apply to the poorer houses.(b) There are &quot; new control &quot; rents ii.e., rents brought into control in 1939).These (broadly speaking) apply to the better and newer houses.(c) Then there are houses subject to &quot; new tenancies,&quot; i.e., houses that have beenlet for the first time since September 1939. Some of these rents havebeen reviewed by rent tribunals.17. There are wide variations between the rents of houses, not only between those in one group and those in another, but also between the rents of houseswithin the same group. For a time the &quot; old control &quot; rents were freed when the landlord came into possession, and this resulted in some extraordinary discrepancies.Recent investigations have shown that, tenants are paying very different rents foridentical houses in the same street it may be for adjoining houses; and also thatwhile many rents of essentially sound houses are very low, too low for it to bepossible for the landlord to execute repairs out of the rent, others are higher than had generally been supposed.Figures as low as 4s., 5s. or 6.?. a week are not unusual for &quot; old control &quot;rents of houses which are of quite good quality; while the rents of other identicalhouses are already appreciably higher often around 8s. to 10s. a week, and some-times much more. Many of the &quot;new control&quot; rents are under 10s. a week;while the rents of some identical houses are over  1. Even among the &quot;newtenancies &quot; there is no uniformity. Rent tribunals, when asked to review a rent,have found it very difficult, in the conditions of housing shortage, to discover anyprinciple on which to fix it.18. Many rents are now plainly insufficient, and indeed have been for years past, to enable the landlord to pay out of the rent what is needed for keeping thehouse in good condition. Supposing that almost the whole of the rent is devotedto repair (and something must be allowed for management and cost of collection),a rent of  10 to  15 per annum for even a small house will hardly meet the repairbill, year in and year out; and for a larger house the bill will be proportionatelylarger. Local authorities, who alone amongst house-owning bodies are free toraise then rents, have found themselves compelled to do so more than once sincethe war, partly because of the high cost of post-war building (and the desirabilityof spreading the burden), but partly also, as many of them have made clear to their tenants, because of the much increased cost of maintenance and repair. Thusmunicipal rents have been rising while the rents of other dwellings have remainedstationary.19. Since there is still a severe housing shortage, rents of privately-ownedhouses cannot yet be freed from control. Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not thinkthat it would be right for the present to free even the houses in the higher rateable value categories as was done in the 1930s; and that method of approach would notin any event deal with the problem of maintenance and repair among those housesleft under control.20. They propose, however, that houses which are owned by such non-profit-making bodies as housing associations and new town corporations should be freed from control and so put into the same category as houses owned by local authorities.21. The main question resolves itself, therefore, into the most equitable wayof allowing such increases in the rents of privately-owned houses as will enable the landlord to keep the house in good repair.The purpose must be to secure repairs and thus preserve a national asset.22.   The easiest way would, of course, be a general percentage increase inrents. This has certain advantages:  (a) It seems reasonably fair (although as shown above it would in England andWales really work very unfairly).(b) It was done before in 1920 and therefore has the advantage of followingprecedent (although, when it was done before, the present great and artificial variations of rent did not exist).(c) No individual rent rises for any individual tenant by more than the generalpercentage increase and this also has the semblance of fairness.
The basic objection to this method is that, since the present rent structure is illogicaland unfair, a percentage increase would accentuate all the anomalies. So far from being the fairest method it would be the most inequitable.23. Another suggestion, made by Lord Ridley&apos;s Committee in 1945, is for renttribunals to adjudicate. But there are strong objections to elevating what can bea convenient piece of machinery, designed for particular and special cases, into one for general application. The administrative task would certainly be very heavy.In effect the proposal would mean setting up a parallel machine to that nowoperated by the Board of Inland Revenue for the central valuation for ratingpurposes. (In justice to Lord Ridley&apos;s Committee, it should be borne in mind thatthis machine did not exist when they reported.)24. No wholly satisfactory system of fixing maximum rents can be devisedpending a sufficient supply of houses. When the new and uniform valuation for rating comes into operation that will provide a firm basis to which rents can be related on some definite principle so long as control continues necessary. But wecannot wait for 1955 or 1956, the earliest date by which the new valuation can becompleted. We must introduce a stop-gap measure in order to improve living conditions and to save the houses from further deterioration.25. An interesting proposal was put forward by the Royal Institution ofChartered Surveyors in May 1951. They suggested that a basis for fixing increases in rent could be provided by the statutory deduction for rating purposes. Theevidence showed that the statutory deduction for rating purposes represented in1939 the general cost of maintaining and repairing houses. It followed that a fairincrease ot rent would be such multiple of the statutory deduction as correspondedto the percentage increase in costs since 1939. The Institution estimated that theincreased cost of repairs since 1939 amounted in March 1951 to 175 per cent, andwas then still rising. They therefore recommended in effect that controlled rentsshould be allowed to increase by an amount equal to such percentage increase ofthe statutory deduction.This suggestion has received a measure of support in other professionalquarters.26. Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose to adopt the principle of this scheme,namely, that pending the universal revaluation the rent increases to be allowed inEngland and Wales should be related to the statutory deduction for rating purposes.27. The Committee on Housing Costs under the Chairmanship of Mr. Girdwoodhave carried out an investigation on the relationship of the present annual cost withthat ruling in 1939 of maintaining house property in good and tenantable repair,having regard to the relative cost of wages, materials, overheads and rates of profit. Their conclusion is that what would cost  100 in 1939 would cost 316 to-day.28. Logically, therefore, since the cost of repairs is now just over three timeswhat it was in 1939, it would follow that if rents were permitted to rise by twice the statutory deduction, this would enable landlords to repair and maintain houses to the standard they adopted in 1939. But Her Majesty&apos;s Government believethat this increase would be rather severe to some tenants, and that a lower figure should be sufficient to enable landlords to tackle essential repairs. Accordingly,their proposal is that the maximum increase in rents should be limited to one-and-a-half times the statutory deduction.29. Further, since as already pointed out the rents of some houses are alreadyhigh, it is proposed that no rent should, by reason of the proposal in the preceding paragraph, rise above twice the existing gross value of the house. The effect ofthese proposals taken together, on houses in the different gross value groups, canbe seen by looking at the figures in Appendix II.One or &quot;two examples will illustrate the effect. Take a house with an existinggross value for rating of  15. The statutory deduction is  6. The maximum rent increase allowed under these proposals would be  9 per annum or approximately3s. 6d. a week. But the rent may not, by reason of these proposals, increase beyondtwice the gross value; that is, beyond  30 per annum or approximately lls. 6d. aweek. If the present rent is less than 8s. a week it may increase by the full 3s. 6d.If it is more than 8s. the increase is less than 3s. 6d. If it is already lls. 6d. a week or more there is no increase.
The Slum Houses34. Slum houses are houses which by reason of disrepair or sanitary defectsare unfit for human habitation or by reason of their bad arrangement or the narrow-ness or bad arrangement of the streets are dangerous or injurious to the health ofthe inhabitants. The number of slum houses cannot be reliably estimated. Thenumber included in pre-war programmes in England and Wales was about 472,000of which a balance of 173,500 was outstanding in 1940. The number dealt withbetween that date and March 31st, 1951, was 33,700. So about 140,000 houses stillstand which were scheduled for demolition before the war. These figures take no account of the houses that have become slums since the pre-war programmes were drawn up. Attempts have been made since 1945, by different investigators, to assess the total number of irredeemably unfit houses we have now to deal with.Their assessments vary, but the number certainly runs into hundreds of thousands.These houses are beyond redemption. They are in more than one sense thecore of the problem-the decaying centre of so many communities of all sizes fromcity to village.35. It is an essential part of the Government^ plan that local authoritiesshould take up again the great campaign of slum clearance the war interrupted.They will be urged to start on this forthwith.Or take a house with an existing gross value of  25. The statutory, deductionis  7. The maximum rent increase in this case would be  10 10s. per annum, orapproximately 4s. a week; and the highest figure to which the rent could beincreased would be  50 per annum or approximately 19s. 3d a week. If thepresent rent is less than 155. 3d a week it may increase by the full 4s. If it is morethan 15s. 3d. a week the increase is less than 45. It is already 19s. 3d. a week ormore there is no increase.The great majority of houses subject to rent restriction have at present a gross value of less than  30; something over 5 million out of a total of about million. Over 4 million have a gross value of less than  20 10s. The first exampletherefore is the most characteristic; and the two together cover the main range ofthe effects.30. Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend that a landlord will be permitted to claim an increase in rent only if the house is in good and tenantable repair. If thehouse is not already in such a state of repair, the landlord must put it right beforeclaiming an increase. However, if the tenant considers at any time that the house is not maintained in this state of repair he can apply to the local authority for a&quot; certificate of disrepair &quot; and this certificate would enable him to withhold the permitted increase in rent until such time as the house is put right.31. Further, Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend that no rent increase shallbe allowed unless and until the landlord has actually spent money on repairs. Itwould not be fair that the landlord should get the increase if in fact it is the tenantwho has done all the work necessary to keep the house in good and tenantablerepair. It will be provided therefore that the landlord must show that he had spenton repairs over a specified period not less on an annual average than a specifiedminimum sum. It is proposed that the period should run from the 1st January, 1953(so as to allow for past work) up to the date of claim; and that the minimum sumXZti.lt. should be equivalent to^tpne and a half times the statutory deduction applicable tothe house.32. An example will make this clear. If the gross value of a house is  .15,and the statutory deduction  6 the maximum permitted rent increase would be  9per annum. The landlord who claims this increase, say in June 1954, i.e., 18 monthsafter the 1st January, 1953, would have to show that he had spent not less thanone-iand-a half times  9, i.c,  13 lOfr,/since 1st January, 1953, on repairs to the/, 1^^^^house. This will apply whatever is the present rent and whatever the actualincreases permitted in accordance with paragraphs 28 and 29.33. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that this scheme for increases in rentswill work to the mutual advantage of landlord and tenant. It should assist pending something better--in maintaining the stock of good quality houses availableto the population at large, which is one of our most valuable national assets.
36. This does not mean that the whole of the local authority^ housing effort should be switched to the demolition, and replacement of slums. To concentratesuddenly and exclusively on the slums would be as wrong as to go on ignoringthem. The pace and phasing of a slum clearance programme must be for the localauthority to determine in the first place--by measuring that need against the generalhousing need which has occupied its attention since 1945. But the essential thingis that each.local authority ought to have a programme, to ascertain the size oftheir slum problem, to have a phased plan of demolition and replacement (and of repair for such slums as may have to continue to be occupied for years) and thatthey should begin now to put the programme into operation.37. Probably the majority of local authorities would be able to make animmediate start by taking up again the schemes of clearance which they hadtemporarily to abandon in 1939. They will have areas subject to confirmed orders on which they could take immediate clearance action as soon as they are able torehouse the occupants; they will have other areas on which they have gone throug hall the stages which precede the submission of an Order for confirmation.Five-Year Programmes38. But it is not simply a question of beginning where we were forced tobreak off in 1939. The burden of arrears has been growing for .14 years. Mostlocal authorities have a reasonably accurate idea of the size of the problem in theirown area as a result of the regular inspections which the law requires them tomake. But the problem must be assessed on a national scale too. The Ministerof Housing and Local Government must be aware, and must be able to inform parliament of the way in which local authorities are setting about the task andmust be able to satisfy himself that their proposals, singly and in total, do not exceedor fall short of the resources that can properly be allocated for these purposes.39. It is proposed therefore, as was done in the original slum clearancecampaign in 1931, to require each local authority to submit a programme to theMinister showing the number of houses they propose to demolish over the years,and their proposals for replacing them by new houses. The Ministers function in examining these programmes will be to consider on the one hand whether theyare adequate, and on the other their impact on the resources of money, labourand materials.The Problem of Deferred Demolition40. It is clear that many of these slum dwellings must continue in use forsome time to come. Some local authorities may be able to deal with the bulk oftheir slum problem in 10 years, some in 15, but some will need a good deal longer.The task of providing new houses in replacement of slums while continuing to meetthe genuine needs of people without a separate home of their own, is formidable.41. The Government consider it a national duty to see that the slum houses which have to be used for years to come should be made more tolerable for thepeople who have to live in them until something better can be provided.This task, in the Government^ opinion, can be entrusted only to the localauthorities.42. It must be borne in mind that these houses are by definition irretrievablyunfit for habitation. There is no question of enabling them to escape demolition.Most of them are in towns. Some of them are scattered among other dwellings,which are either fit or are capable of being made fit, but the bulk are in areas wherealmost all the dwellings are equally bad areas which can only be cleared andredeveloped as a whole, even though that means demolishing a minority of dwel-lings still individually fit for human habitation.43. These are areas which local authorities have been and will be againdealing with as clearance areas. Frequently they will be areas which, in order toensure proper redevelopment, the local authority would wish to acquire by com-pulsory purchase order. What the Government envisage is an interim stage inthis process.  Whereas in the past the local authority have acquired slum houses
only with a view to immediate demolition, they will, now be acquiring them in orderto do what can be done to improve their condition until demolition and replacementbecome practicable.44. This may be a novel idea. Many local authorities may at first heartilydislike the idea of becoming and remaining landlords of slum properties. Butdecency and humanity demand that those who must continue to live in thesehouses should be made as comfortable as possible while they are waiting to berehoused.45. The houses are unfit and marked down for demolition. They are beyondhelp at any cost which could be met out of rent. Only the local authorities can dealwith them by accepting the necessary expenditure in part at least as a charge on public funds, and to do this they must own them. In so doing they will be acting as liquidators and as they do in many other respects as trustees for the public.They will be making these houses clean, dry, and weatherproof, for people whosesituation is now bad and must otherwise steadily worsen before they can be pro-vided with new houses.46. It is the Governments intention, therefore so to amend the Housing Actsas to enable these operations to be carried out. Briefly what is required is to enable a local authority while taking exactly the action under the Acts which leads nor-mally to demolition (declaration of an area submission to the Minister of a com-pulsory purchase order Ministers inquiry and decision), to defer demolition until they can carry the process to its proper conclusion.47. This interim stage in the treatment of slums will be an integral part ofeach local authority&apos;s programme wherever it is not possible to replace anddemolish all the unfit areas in their district within [5] years. Accordingly authorities will be expected to include in their programmes, in addition to their proposals fordemolishing and replacement, a supplementary set of proposals for acquiring ares which they are unable to deal with in this way within the next [5] years, with theobject of carrying out essential temporary repairs.48. It is recognised that this will place an administrative burden on many local authorities, and not by any means exclusively on the larger authorities whoare better staffed to undertake it. Ideally it would mean that each authority dealtwith the sum total of their unfit areas in [5] years, either permanently by demolitionor temporarily by repairs. Clearly that will be impracticable in many areas wherethe slum problem is as old as the Industrial Revolution. There will be a limit tothe number of houses it will be possible to acquire and repair in a single operation,and (as with the properties which are to he demolished without repair) it will benecessary to adopt a scheme of priorities on which acquisition for repair is toproceed.49. But whatever burden is involved this is a task which every local authority must face wherever they are forced to leave people in unfit houses with no reason-ably early prospect of rehousing. It is a responsibility this temporary care ofslum-dwellings-which the Minister of Housing and Local Government will sharewith the local authority by the approval he gives to their programme; and theywill have the support of all who favour a practical and realistic approach to theproblem.5.0. Local authorities will be put ito extra expense; and Parliament will beinvited to authorise additional grants for this purpose. It is proposed that partof the extra financial assistance should be towards the annual costs of amortisationof loans for the acquisition during the period that the properties continue to be occupied. (The present grant system already provides assistance towards there-development of a site after the properties have been demolished.) The other part of the extra financial assistance should, it is proposed, take the form of a fixed annual sum for 15 years for each dwelling, or part dwelling in separateoccupation, towards the costs of bulk works of improvement and the subsequentannual maintenance and supervision. With some increase in the rents as a con-tribution from the tenants, the Exchequer grant is designed to share the burden which would otherwise fall on the local authority.51. From the human angle the money and work involved in these operationswill be well expended. There should be countervailing savings on sickness, disease,human degradation and crime.
Dilapidated Houses52. Some landlords may not be willing or able to bring their property tothe highest standard &quot; good and tenantable repair &quot; to which the rent increase will be linked.53. They have nevertheless a duty to keep it fit for human habitation andlocal authorities have powers under the Housing Acts to require landlords tomaintain their houses in that condition.54. If a local authority consider that a house is in any respect unfit for human habitation and can be made fit at a reasonable expense, they may require theowner to carry out the repairs needed to make it fit.55. Comparatively little use has been made of these powers since the war,chiefly because post-war licensing control has in effect limited repairs to work ofa specially urgent nature and has largely ruled out the comprehensive repairs forwhich the powers are intended. That control has however been considerablyrelaxed and local authorities now have scope to use their powers more freely. It is part of the Governments plan that they should do so.56. But the powers themselves need some improvement. For one thingalthough they are aimed at houses which are &quot; unfit for human habitation &quot; the term is not defined in the Housing Acts. The lack of a definition has led to a variety of decisions in the Courts on what unfitness means and consequently toa great deal of uncertainty about what work a local authority may require a land-lord to do in any particular case. It seems clear to the Government that a statutorydefinition would help both parties concerned, the local authority in framing its requirements and the landlord in deciding the extent of his responsibilities.57. The case for definition is supported in the recommendations of a Sub-Committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee which submitted a reportto the Minister of Health on &quot; Standards of Fitness &quot; in 1946. The Sub-Committeeincluded officers and members of local authorities with a long experience in thesematters and examined a great mass of evidence on the operation of the existing law. Its conclusion was that a standard of fitness could and ought to be defined and the Government proposes to amend the Housing Acts on the lines recommendedby the Sub-Committee in its report.58. Again although the powers are confined to houses which are capable ofbeing made fit at &quot; reasonable expense &quot; this term also is not defined and hasreceived different interpretations. The Government are considering a formula which would fix what is reasonable expense by reference to the expected life ofthe house when repaired and the rent it would produce during that life.59. Finally the procedure by which a local authority may carry out the neces-sary repairs where the landlord is unwilling to do them, and recover the cost from him, does not always work well. Many local authorities have complained that theprocess of recovering costs is slow and unsatisfactory. It is intended to simplifythat statutory procedure at this point.60. Summed up, what it comes to is that Landlords will be required to ensurethat the houses for which they are responsible are &quot; fit for human habitation &quot;where that can be done at reasonable cost. If a landlord fails to do this the localauthority will be expected to do it for him, and at his expense. If the house cannotbe made &quot; fit for human habitation &quot; at reasonable expense, it becomes a candidate for demolition and replacement; or under the proposals in this Paper for care bythe local authority pending demolition. This is already the intention of the law(excepting the proposal for temporary care pending demolition) and the purposeof the amendments will be to clarify the law and make it more effective.61. The landlord will not be entitled to any increase of rent where all thathe does, or the local authority does for him, is to make the house &quot; fit for human habitation.&quot; To earn the increased rent he must go further and put the houseinto &quot;good and tenantable repair.&quot; The rent increases proposed should enablelandlords to make this extra effort, given the basic assumption that the house canbe made &quot; fit for human habitation &quot; at reasonable expense.
Improvements and Conversions. : 62.   If we are to prolong the useful life of as many houses as are worthkeeping there is more than repair work to be done.63. Many houses, while sound structurally and good for many years yet, areold and lack modern amenities a bathroom, a hot water system, a water closet,or any other of the services regarded to-day as a necessity to provide proper housing conditions. Other houses equally sound were built for another age and are too large for present day conditions. Some of them have been converted for occupation by a number of families, but converted badly without providing asatisfactory dwelling for each.   Some are standing empty.64. These two sorts of house the house that needs improving and the house that needs proper conversion are well on the road to permanent unfitness unless they can have the treatment they need.65. There is already available under the Housing Act, 1949 Exchequerassistance to owners who are prepared to improve or convert their property.Grants can be made of half the cost involved per dwelling (subject to a maximumgrant of  400) the conditions being that the scheme receives the approval of thelocal authority and the Minister of Housing and Local Government, that the househas an expected life of 30 years and that when the work is done the house will reach a standard laid down by the Minister.66. The Act regulates the rent that may be charged when the work is done.If the house was already let the new rent must not exceed the old by more than6 per cent, of that part of the cost of the work borne by the owner. If it was notlet the local authority fix an appropriate rent.67. The Government have examined the operation of these provisions inorder to find out why they have proved so ineffective and what is the remedy.Little more than 3,000 dwellings have been improved with the aid of the grant and only 700 new dwellings created by conversion.68. It is clear in the first place that these facilities are not sufficiently wellknown. The Act was passed at a time when licensing quotas made it difficult toallow anything but the most urgent work of repair and maintenance. There wasnot much point therefore in giving special publicity to the grants at that time andmany owners are still ignorant of their existence.69. There has also been criticism of the statutory conditions and theMinister^ standard.70. A house must have an expected life of 30 years in order to qualify. Butif a house can be made to provide satisfactory living conditions for a shorter period,say 20 years, it is surely work which is well worth doing in our present housingneed. It is proposed therefore to alter this condition so that houses with a shorter period of expected life may be accepted..71. There must be also an adequate return on the money invested. 6 percent is not enough in present conditions to induce owners to undertake this, sortpi work. The Government intend to raise the 6 per cent, to 8 per cent. In fixing the rent of a house not previously let local authorities will be required to take intoaccount the age and condition of the dwelling after the work has been carried out and the money the owner has spent.72. Finally the Ministers standard. The requirements which the Ministerlays down are individually reasonable. But it would not be reasonable to insist on them all in all cases (e.g., where the necessary public services are lacking) andin fact the Minister has always been willing to waive individual requirements wheregood reason could be shown.73. But this power of waiver has not been sufficiently appreciated by thepublic and even by some local authorities who have been applying the standardrigidly and rejecting proposals of real value which do not comply in every detail.74. Properly known and used these grants under the Act of 1949 can be an immense help in the preservation of the national stock of sound houses and inadapting it to modern needs.
75. If this work of adapting and improving is not done it will mean prematuredecay for large numbers of houses. A nationwide programme of improvement andconversion could save them and extend their useful life for another generation orlonger. Two things are necessary: first that house owners know of these grants and how to obtain them: secondly, that local authorities do their utmost to helpapplicants and potential applicants for grant in framing acceptable proposals. TheGovernment propose to take action accordingly.Legislation76. All these proposals represent, in the Governments opinion, a com-prehensive and practicable plan for making the best use of the nation&apos;s houses. Thenecessary statutory powers will be sought in a Bill which will be introduced at thebeginning of the next session.77. The Bill will contain a clause amending Section 85(5) of the Housing Act,1936, and setting out some considerations which local authorities should take intoaccount in fixing the rents of Council houses and flats.The Future78. It is apparent that the operations outlined in this paper the repair, con-version and improvement of houses, the beginning of a new drive to clear the slums,and the continuation of the new house building programme will make a newdemand on our resources. But the resources are the same. The physical means the labour and materials for carrying out all this work will remain unaltered.79. It will be necessary therefore to balance one part of the programme against another and to weigh the due proportion of effort to be put into each. Localauthorities will have to reconsider the proportion of their programme they candevote in future to general housing needs now that they will be concerned ona progressively increasing scale with the demolition and replacement of the slums.80. Private enterprise must play a greater part in the provision of houses forgeneral needs and will be encouraged to do so by further relaxation of the licensingcontrol on the erection of new houses and by standardising the conditions on which local authorities are prepared to lend money to prospective house purchasers and(by guarantees) to enable Building Societies to increase their normal advances.81. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that this comprehensive attack uponthe housing problem will commend itself to the great mass of the public as bothpractical and imaginative.82. The building of new houses is a vital part of the housing programme andis proceeding on an encouraging scale. But the maintenance and rescue of theexisting houses where possible and their demolition and replacement where necessarymust be embarked on as an urgent and compelling task. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment feel that they are setting out on a new and inspiring adventure. They areconscious of the difficulties and complexities. There is no quick and easy remedy for an evil which took root a century and a half ago and has been growing ever since. They are nevertheless fortified by the experience of the last year and are confident of the national response to a supreme national need.
