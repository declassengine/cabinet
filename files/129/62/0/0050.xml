DRAFT WHITE PAPERHOUSINGA COMPREHENSIVE POLICYIntroductionThe purpose of this Paper is to state in broad outline the problems whichhave to be faced if housing conditions in England and Wales are to be improved,and the measures which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have taken or propose to take to deal with those problems.2. The target which the Government set themselves on taking office at theend of 1951 was the completion of 300,000 new houses a year. New houses arealready being built at that rate. Unless unforeseen difficulties arise, 300,000 new houses should be completed in 1953 for the first time since the war,3. But the housing conditions of the country do not depend solely on the:building of new houses, though there are still too many families in genuine need of a separate home of their own. Housing conditions depend also on maintaining the houses built before the war; on overtaking the arrears of repair work whichhas been neglected more and more each year since war broke out in 1939; onkeeping the structurally sound houses in good order; on improving those which lackmodern amenities and making better use of them, e.g., by converting into two ormore dwellings those which are too big for one family under modern conditions;(and finally on demolishing and replacing as soon as possible those which are unfit for human habitation and cannot be made fit at reasonable expense.4. The success of the Governmenfs measures for the building of new houses(makes it possible now to turn to the old houses, and to consider what needs to bedone to make better use of them for the benefit of the community as a whole.5. This Paper considers all these aspects of the national housing problem,and explains the Governmenfs policy for dealing with them not separately one by one, but as parts of a single problem and of a comprehensive plan.-: 6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the people of this country prefer,in housing as in other matters, to help themselves as much as they can rather than to rely wholly or mainly upon the efforts of Government, national or local. Indeed,nearly 4 million families in Great Britain already own their own homes. It is forthis reason that during the present Parliament the Government have given to takeone example progressively greater freedom to private enterprise to play a steadily increasing part in building new houses. Licences for building small houses arenow given as of right to the individual, and much more freely to the developer.For a variety of reasons, it takes many months before such a reorientation ofpolicy can result in a completed house. Nor was it possible to remove a majorobstacle to private development the &quot; development charge &quot; until the end of1952.Nevertheless, while the number of houses built to private account or for owner-occupiers had sunk to 22,550 in 1951, it rose to 34,320 in 1952. At the end of thatyear a further 39,300 were under construction. In the first seven months of 1953(the first year of the system of automatic licences) 31,400 odd were completed; afurther 55,900 were under construction at the end of last July.7. One object of future housing policy will be to continue to promote, by allpossible means, the building of new houses for owner-occupation. Of all formsof saving, this is one of the best. Of all forms of ownership this is one of the mostsatisfying to the individual and the most beneficial to the nation.,.. . 8. While anxious to epcpurage the;spread of house,ownership,Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have been equally conscious of the need for houses to rent to meet
the requirements of the greater part perhaps necessarily the greater part-of thepopulation. They have been careful to secure that the building of more houses tosell shall not prejudice the building of houses to let. In 1951, 172,280 houses were built to let in Great Britain, 22,550 to sell. In 1952, the corresponding figures were205,600 and 34,320. For 1953, the estimated completions will be 245,000 to letand 55,000 to sell.9.   This dual policy seems to be at once fair and sensible. It will be continued.10. But, as has been indicated, the housing problem which Her Majesty&apos;present Government inherited at the end of 1951 goes beyond the provision ofnew houses. It comprises also the care of old houses. It has therefore twoaspects:  the provision of new houses both for sale and for letting for peoplewithout a separate home of their own; andthe condition of existing houses, most of them needing repair, manyneeding improvement, some fit only for demolition.Housing before and during the war11. Before the war the nation was making good headway in dealing with boththe provision of new houses and the maintenance of existing houses. New houses and fiats were being built at the rate of over 300,000 a year. Labour and materialswere available for repairs and improvements. A campaign for slum clearance and&quot;the abatement of gross overcrowding was in full career.In 1939 the national stock of houses and flats was about equal to the numberof separate families. Only 6 per cent, of the population were living in unfit or over-crowded houses; about 30 per cent, were living in houses built since .19.19.12.   This progress was cut short by the war..13. The building of new houses and fiats virtually ceased. Repair and main-tenance the first line of defence in housing and therefore in health had perforceto be neglected. Consequently, the condition of large numbers of houses began to deteriorate. Slum clearance and the abatement of gross overcrowding had to be abandoned.14. Between 1939 and 1945 the number of houses built did not exceed 200,000in all. Enemy action entirely destroyed over 225,000 houses; severely damaged-afurther 550,000; and damaged in varying degrees a very much larger number.15. The rents of all privately-owned dwellings of a rateable value notexceeding  100 in London,  90 in Scotland and  75 elsewhere, were necessarilybrought under control on the outbreak of war (if they were not already controlled).This control has not yet been lifted.Post-War Years and the Problem before us16. Since the end of the war, apart from the repair of war-damaged houses,successive Governments have devoted their energies in the housing field to building new houses and flats.17. The number of new permanent dwellings built in Great Britain in thevarious years since the war are as follows (in round figures):  1946   ...... ...      ...      ...... 55,0001947 ...      ... ............ 140,0001948 ...      ... ...... ... 228,0001949 ...      ... ... ...      ...      ... 198,0001950 ... ............ 198,0001951 ...      ... ... ...      ...      ... 195,0001952 &quot; ... ... ......       ... 240,000         V...   :,:1953 (estimated) ... ...    : ... 300,000        &apos; &apos;:The full table is in Appendix I. :.:.   :18. This expansion of the new housing programme enables as now to turn tothe problem of the old houses.
The essentially sound houses22. The great bulk of our houses is fortunately either/in good condition maintenance and repair having been carried out by the landlords despite rent restriction, and sometimes by the tenants or capable of being put into good con-dition without any very drastic change in the present system. Nevertheless, it isgenerally admitted that the annual cost of repairs which has been rising steadily even to houses, in generally good condition can-, in many cases, no- longer be met by the landlord out of the rent.23.. The Girdwood Committee,,, whose report has. just, been publishedhave carried out an investigation into, the relationship between the present amualcost of maintaining house property in good repair, and that ruling in 1939. They;took into account the relative, cbst^ of profit.19. At the present time there are about .13^ million individual dwellings(houses and flats) in Great Britain.   Of these, about 3i million are lived in by owner-occupiers;2\ million are rented from local authorities, new town corporations,housing associations, &amp;c,7^ million are rented from private landlords, large and small.Of the li million houses owned by private landlords over 21 million are 100years old or more; a further If million are more than 75 years old; a furtherI million are over 65 years old. These are striking figures; they give a measure ofthe problem before us. Some of these houses are in a perfectly good state of repair.Some need only minor repairs. Some are in a bad state. Some are obsolescent.Some ought to be condemned. For the present we need them all except perhaps the worst. Leaving the worst out of account, none ought to be allowed to deteriorate further. For the great majority represent an important national asset.By the end of this year the number of dwellings, permanent and temporary, pro-vided since the war in one way or another will have approached two millions. we now have elbow room in which to turn more to the maintenance, repair and, where necessary, improvement of the old houses, and the demolition and replacement ofthose in such a condition that they ought to be demolished.20. There have been many allegations that houses are falling down or beingabandoned. To the extent that this may be true it mainly applies to those houses which are really obsolete and cannot be improved or made fit for modern ideas at reasonable cost. It is worth remembering that, if there had been no war, and slum clearance had proceeded ;at the rate achieved by 1938, large numbers of these houses would have been pulled down and replaced by now.21. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly prepared a comprehensive plan of repair, maintenance, improvement and demolition which covers all types and conditions of house. It is a Better Housing Campaign. It divides houses intofour classes:  (i) The best the great mass of essentially sound houses many of which arein good condition and all of which the landlords could be expected tokeep in good condition given a reasonable rent. This in many casesmust mean some increase in rent.(ii) The worst the slum houses which ought to be demolished as soon as circumstances permit. Only a proportion can be pulled down and replaced in the next 5 years. Since the rest must, of necessity, remainin use they should at least be patched up in order to make life moretolerable for their occupants.(iii) An intermediate class the &quot; dilapidated &quot; houses-some of which maybe brought into the first class by their owners, others of which localauthorities may have to get repaired and made at least fit for human habitation by greater use of their statutory powers.(iv) Houses which could give years of good service if they were improved-that is to say provided with bathrooms, hot water, up-to-date cookingarrangements and other necessary amenities: also nouses too big for present-day needs which could be converted into good, comfortableflats..
Their conclusion is that, on the average, what cost  100 in 1939 would have cost 316 in April 1953. &quot; vi24. The neglect which privately-owned houses have suffered in recent years is due primarily to two causes. From September 1939 to the end of last year people were not allowed to carry out repairs exceeding a certain low figure of cost unless they could get not only a building licence but also licences for controlled materialssuch as timber and steel; and they could get the necessary licences only if they could show that the work was extremely urgent. The only controlled material now istimber, of which supplies are becoming easier. And since the beginning of this yearanyone has been free to spend up to  500 per annum on house repair without a building licence and permission can readily be got to spend more if necessary. so the need for licences is no longer an obstacle.25. The other and more serious cause is rent control. There is at present inEngland and Wales a hopelessly illogical system of rents (a) There are &quot; old control &quot; rents (i.e., rents first controlled in 1920 or beforeand never decontrolled). These (broadly speaking) are the lowest rents and apply to the poorer houses.(b) There are &quot;new control&quot; rents (i.e., rents brought into control in 1939).These (broadly speaking) apply to the better and newer houses.(c) Then there are houses subject to &quot;new tenancies,&quot; (i.e., houses that havebeen let for the first time since September 1939). Some of these rentshave been reviewed by Rent Tribunals.&quot; 1 26. There are wide variations between the rents of houses, not only between those in one group and those in another, but also between the rents of houseswithin the same group. For a time the &quot; old control&quot; rents were freed when the landlord came into possession, and this resulted in some extraordinary discrepancies.Recent investigations have shown that, tenants are paying very different rents foridentical houses in the same street it may be for adjoining houses; and also thatwhile many rents of essentially sound houses are very low, too low for it to bepossible for the landlord to execute repairs out of the rent, others are higher than had generally been supposed.Figures as low as 4s., 5s. or 6s. a week are not unusual for &quot;old control&quot;rents of houses which are of quite good quality; while the rents of other identicalhouses are already appreciably higher often around 8s. to 10s. a week, and some-times much more. Many of the &quot;new control&quot; rents are under 10s. a week;while the rents of some identical houses are over  1. Even among the &quot;newtenancies &quot; there is no uniformity. Rent Tribunals, when asked to review a rent,have found it very difficult, in the conditions of housing shortage, to discover anyprinciple on which to fix it.27. Many rents are now plainly insufficient, and indeed have been for years past, to enable the landlord to pay out of the rent what is needed for keeping thehouse in good condition. Supposing that almost the whole of the rent is devotedto repair (and something must be allowed for management and cost of collection),a rent of  10 to  15 per annum for even a small house will hardly meet the repairbill, year in and year out; and for a larger house the bill will be proportionatelylarger. Local authorities, who alone amongst house-owning bodies are free toraise their rents, have found themselves compelled to do so more than once sincethe war, as many of them have made clear to their tenants, for a number ofi reasons,one being the much increased cost of maintenance and repair. Thus municipalrents have been rising while the rents of other dwellings have remained stationary.28. Since there is still a severe housing shortage, rents of privately-ownedhouses cannot yet be freed from; control. Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not thinkthat it would yet be right to free even the houses in the higher rateable valuecategories as was done in the 1930s; that method of approach would.not. in any event deal with the problem of maintenance and repair among those houses leftunder control. &apos;29: The main question resolves itself, therefore, into the most equitable Wayof allowing such increases in the rents of privately-owned houses as will enable5 the landlord to keep the house in good repair.The purpose must be to secure repairs and thus preserve a national asset:
30. The easiest way would, of course, be a general percentage increase inrents. This has certain advantages:  (a) It seems on the face of it reasonably fair (although as shown above itwould in England and Wales really work very unfairly)..     (b) It was done before in 1920 and therefore has the advantage of.followingprecedent (although, when it was done; before, the present great and artificial variations of rent did not exist),.     (c) No individual rent rises for any individual tenant by more than the:generaipercentage increase-and this also has the semblance,of fairness,The basic objection to this method is that, since in England and Wales the presentrent structure is illogical and unfair, a percentage increase would accentuate allthe anomalies. So far from being the fairest method it would be the mostinequitable.31. Another suggestion, made by Lord Ridley&apos;s Committee in 1945, is for RentTribunals to adjudicate. But there are strong objections to elevating what can bea convenient piece of machinery, designed for particular and special cases, into one for general application. The administrative task would certainly be very heavy.In effect the proposal would mean setting up a parallel machine to that nowoperated in England and Wales by the Board of Inland Revenue for the centralvaluation for rating purposes. This machine did not exist when Lord Ridley&apos;sCommittee reported.32. The valuation of a dwelling for rating purposes is based on the rent it maybe expected to fetch in a free market on the footing that the landlord bears thecost of repairs and maintenance and the tenant pays the rates. No wholly satis-factory system of fixing maximum rents and this is of the essence of rent control-can be devised short of a universal and uniform valuation such as the Board of inland Revenue are now making for rating purposes. Even such a valuation has its difficulties when the supply of houses falls short of the demand. Once supplybecomes adequate it will cease to be necessary to fix maximum rents. meanwhile the new and uniform valuation for rating purposes now being made by referenceto rental levels in 1939 the last year in which a reasonably free market existed inthis country may provide some guide to proper maximum rents should rent controlstill be necessary when the valuation comes into effect. Until that time comessomething must be done as a stop-gap measure to improve living conditions andto save the rent-controlled houses from further deterioration.33. An interesting proposal was put forward by the Royal Institution ofChartered Surveyors in May 1951. The rent a dwelling may be expected to fetchin a free market on the footing described above is its &quot; gross value&quot; for ratingpurposes. Its &quot; rateable value &quot; the sum on which local rates are payable at somuch in the pound is less than its gross value. The difference known as &quot; thestatutory deduction&quot; is authorised by law, according to a fixed scale, to cover the cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses necessary to maintain the dwellingin a state to command the expected rent. The Institution suggested that thisstatutory deduction provided a basis for fixing rent increases.&apos; The evidence showed that this deduction truly represented in 1939 the general cost of maintaining and repairing houses. It followed that a fair increase of rent would be such multipleof the statutory deduction as corresponded to the percentage increase in costs since1939. The Institution estimated that the increased cost of; repairs since 1939amounted in March 1951 to 1.75 per cent, and was then still rising. (As stated inparagraph 23 above, it now amounts to over 200 per cent.) They therefore recom-mended in effect that controlled rents should be allowed to rise&quot;&quot;by an amount equalto the same percentage increase of the statutory deduction.;;   - .  &apos; *This suggestion has received a measure of; support:; inother professionalquarters.34. Her Majesty&apos;.s: Government propose to adopt this scheme in principle.As has been &quot;shown, the rent of a dwelling may be regarded as composed oL two parts interest on investment and cost of repairs. The Government propose to-allow an increase of rent only, in. respect of the second part.., Thus,: taking thestatutory deduction as representing the true cost of repairs.in 1939, thev proposein England and Wales to allow an appropriate multiple ofit to be added to the rent by way of&quot; repairs increase.&quot;   ,   .   , \   &quot;,     .../,.....
nxv 35. Logically^ since the cost of repairs is now just over three times-what it wasin 1939, it would follow that a repairs increase of twice the statutory deductionwould enable landlords to repair and maintain houses to the standard they adoptedin 1939. But so far the argument has been based on averages; regard must be had to individual cases above and below the average. Her Majesty&apos;s government believe that a repairs increase equal to twice the statutory deduction would fallrather too severely on some tenants, and that a lower multiple should be sufficientto enable landlords to tackle essential repairs. Accordingly, their proposal is thatthe maximum repairs increase should be limited to one-and-a-half times thestatutory deduction.36. Further, since (as already pointed out) the rents of some houses are alreadyhigh, it is proposed that no rent should, by reason of the proposal in the preceding paragraph, rise above twice the existing gross value (for rating purposes) of thehouse.37. The effect of these proposals taken together, on houses in the differentgross value groups, can be seen by looking at the figures in Appendix II.One or two examples will illustrate it. Take a house with an existing grossvalue for rating of  15. The statutory deduction is  6. The maximum repairsincrease allowed under these proposals would be  9 per annum or approximately3s. 6d. a week. But the rent may not, by reason of these proposals, increase beyondtwice the gross value; that is, beyond  30 per annum or approximately 11s. 6d. aweek. If the present rent is less than 85. a week it may increase by the full 3s. 6d.If it is more than 8s. the increase is less than 3s. 6d. If it is already 11s. 6d. a week or more there is no increase.Or take a house with an existing gross value of  25. The statutory deductionis  7. The maximum repairs increase in this case would be  10 10s. per annum,or approximately 4s. a week; and the highest figure to which the rent couldbe increased would be  50 per annum or approximately 19s. 3d. a week. If thepresent rent is less than 15s. 3d. a week it may increase by the full 4s. If it is morethan 15s. 3d. a week the increase is less than 4s. If it is already 19s. 3d. a week ormore there is no increase.The great majority over 5 million out of a total of about 6 million of housessubject to rent restriction have at present a gross value for rating of less than  30.Over 4 million of them have a gross value for rating of less than  20 10s. The firstexample therefore is the most characteristic; and the two examples together coverfive-sixths of all the houses affected by the proposals.38. Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend that a landlord will be permitted to claim a repairs increase only if the house is in &quot; good and tenantable repair.&quot; If thehouse is not already in such a state of repair, the landlord must put it right beforeclaiming a repairs increase. Moreover, if the tenant considers at any time that thehouse is not maintained in this, state of repair he can apply to the local authorityfor a &quot; certificate of disrepair &quot; and this certificate would enable him to withholdpayment of the repairs increase until such time as the house is put right.39. Further, Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend that no repairs increase shallbe allowed unless and until the landlord has actually spent money on repairs. Itwould not be fair that the landlord should get the increase if in fact it is the tenantwho has done all the work necessary to keep the house in good and tenantablerepair. It will be provided therefore that the landlord must, as a test of good faith,show that he had spent on repairs over a specified period not less on an annual average than a specified minimum sum. It is proposed that the period should run from 1st January, 1953 (so as to. allow for past work) up to the date of claim;and that the minimum sum should be equivalent to twice the statutory deductionin respect of the house. This test of the landlord^ good faith will apply once&quot;only-to the initial claim/for the repairs increase. * ^40. An example will make this clear. If the gross value for rating of a house is  15 and the statutory deduction  6, the landlord must show that since 1st January,1953, he had spent on repairs on average not less than  12 a year. The landlordwho claims the repairs increase say at the end of June 1954-i.e., eighteen monthsafter 1st January,. 1953 would have to show that, he had: spent not less than 18 -i.e., one-and-a-half times  12 since 1st January, 1953, on repairs to thehouse. This would be the ease whatever the present rent of the house and whatever the permitted repairs increase would be in accordance with paragraphs 36 and 37.
41. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that these proposals for rent increasesconditional upon repairs will work to the mutual advantage of landlord and tenant.From the national viewpoint they should put and keep millions of houses in goodrepair. The rescue and preservation of our good older houses are indispensableparts of any comprehensive plan for improving the housing conditions of thecountry.42. The proposals described above apply to the generality of unfurnishedhouses in an essentially sound condition in England and Wales. But there remainsome houses the rents of which have been fixed under special enactments: in the lightof post-war conditions. Cases in point are houses built under licence, houses whichhave attracted improvement grants under the Housing Act, 1949, and houses firstlet since the war which have been the subject of an application to the Rent Tribunals.The proposals so far described would not apply to them.43. Opportunity will be taken to allow increases of rents in two particularrespects: first, when a Rent Tribunal determines that a reasonable rent for anunfurnished house first let since 1939 would be higher than the existing rent;second, when the Rent Tribunal approves a higher rent for an unfurnished house letwith services on account of the increased cost of the services since 1939.The Slum Houses44. Slum houses are houses which are unfit for human habitation and cannotbe made fit at &quot; reasonable expense,&quot; or which, by reason of their bad arrangementor the narrowness or bad arrangement of the streets, are dangerous or injurious tothe health of the inhabitants. The number of slum houses cannot be reliably esti-mated. The number included in pre-war clearance programmes in England andWales was about 472,000 of which a balance of 173,500 was outstanding in 1940.The number dealt with between that date and 3.1st March, 1951, was 33,700. Soabout 140,000 slum houses still stand which were scheduled for demolition beforethe war. These figures take no account of the houses that have become slums sincethe pre-war programmes were drawn up. Attempts have been made since 1945, by different investigators, to assess the total number of irredeemably unfit houses wehave now to deal with. Their assessments vary, but the number certainly runs intohundreds of thousands.Many of these houses are beyond redemption. They are in more than one sensethe core of the problem the decaying centre of so many communities of all sizesfrom city to village.45. It is an essential part of the Government^ comprehensive plan that localauthorities should take up again the great campaign of slum clearance which thewar interrupted.  They will be urged to start on this forthwith.The need for slum clearance is urgent from the human point of view. It isequally urgent in the interests of the national economy. We cannot let the centres of our cities decay while they are expanding continually outside their presentboundaries. The core is too valuable, actually and potentially, to be allowed to rotaway; nor can we afford to take for housing and out of food production-morethan the absolute minimum of good agricultural land.There are several reasons why as many as possible of the families now living inslums should be rehoused on or close to the sites from which the slums are cleared.Many people dislike being uprooted from the districts, friends, and haunts they know and like. They prefer to be rehoused near their old; homes and near their work.The demolition and replacement of slum houses must now begin again in realearnest. People will have, to weigh the pros and cons of living in flats against theadvantages of living near their work and where they have always lived. But weshould delude ourselves if we believed that, in the overcrowded areas, it will bepossible, even by building more multi-storey fiats, to rehouse all the existinginhabitants on the cleared sites.When proper arrangements have been made for schools, open spaces, and so forth, it will often be found that some &quot; overspill &quot; problem is left,46. It is not the intention that the whole of the local authority&apos;s housing effort should be switched to. the demolition and replacement of slums. To concentratesuddenly and exclusively on the slums would be as wrong&apos; as to go On ignoringthem. The pace and phasing of a slum clearance programme must be for the localauthority to determine in the first place--by measuring that heed against the general
housing need they have concentrated upon since .1945. But each local authorityought to have a programme, to ascertain the size of their slum problem, to have aphased plan of demolition and replacement (and of repair for such slums as mayhave to continue to be occupied for years); and they should begin soon to put such a programme into operation.47. Probably the majority of local authorities would be able to make animmediate start by taking up again the schemes of clearance which they hadtemporarily to abandon in .1939. They will have areas subject to confirmedclearance orders on which they could take immediate action as soon as they are able to rehouse the occupants; they will have other areas on which they have gonethrough all the stages which precede the submission of an order for confirmation.Five-Year Programmes48. But it is not simply a question of beginning where we were forced tobreak off in 1939. The burden of arrears has been growing for .14 years. Mostlocal authorities have a reasonably accurate idea of the size of the problem in theirown area as a result of the regular inspections which the law requires them tomake. The problem must be assessed on a national scale too. The Ministerof Housing and Local Government must, inform himself, and must be able to inform parliament, of the way in which local authorities are setting about the task, andmust be able to satisfy himself that their proposals, singly and in total, do not exceedor fall short of the resources that can properly be allocated for these purposes.49. It is proposed, therefore, as was done in the original slum clearancecampaign in 1931, to require each local authority to submit a programme to theMinister showing the number of houses they propose to demolish over the years,and their proposals for replacing them by new houses. The Ministers function in examining these programmes will be to consider on the one hand whether theyare adequate, and on the other their impact on the total resources of money, labourand materials available for all housing purposes after the claims of other essentialbuilding work have been considered.The Problem of Deferred Demolition50. It is clear that many slum dwellings must continue to be lived in forsome time to come. Some local authorities will be able to deal with the bulk oftheir slum problems within five years. Where the problem is a major one somemay need 10 years, some 15 and some even longer. The. task of providing new houses in replacement of slums while continuing to meet the genuine needs of people without a separate home of their own, is formidable.51. The Government consider it a national duty to see that the slum houses which have to be used for years to come should be made more tolerable for thepeople who have to live in them until something better can be provided.This task, in the Government^ opinion, can be entrusted only to the localauthorities.52. By definition these houses are unfit for human habitation and cannot bemade fit at &quot; reasonable expense.&quot; That is to say, they cannot be made fit out ofthe landlords resources, bearing in mind the rent which the house can command.Some of them could be made &quot; fit&quot; if money could be made available for repairsover and above what the rent can provide. But most of them ought to be demolishedas soon as it is physically possible to replace them. Even these irretrievably unfithouses could, however, be made more tolerable for occupation while that has tocontinue, if money for the work could be made available.53. Most of these slum houses are in towns. Some of them are scatteredamong other dwellings which are either fit or are capable of being made fit at&quot;reasonable expense.&quot; But the bulk are in areas where almost all the dwellingsare equally bad areas which can only be cleared and re-developed as a whole,even though that means demolishing a minority of dwellings still individually fit for human habitation.54. These are areas which local authorities have been and will be againdealing with as clearance areas. In many cases they are areas which, in order toensure proper re-development, the local authority must, sooner or later, acquire
by compulsory purchase order. What the Government envisage is an interim stage in this process. The local authority will acquire the areas now, even though theycannot hope to demolish the houses for years. And until demolition and repiace-ment become possible, they will do what can be done to improve their condition.55. This may be a novel idea. Many local authorities may at first heartilydislike the prospect of becoming and remaining landlords of slum properties. Butdecency and humanity demand that those who must continue to live in thesehouses should be made as comfortable as possible while they are waiting to berehoused. , i.:   -   -   &apos;. . :56. The houses are unfit and marked down for demolition. They are beyondhelp at any cost which could be met out of rent! Only the local authorities can dealwith them by accepting the necessary expenditure in part at least as a charge on public funds, and to do this the local authorities must own them. In so doing theywill be acting as liquidators and-as they do in many other respects as trusteesfor the public. They will be making these houses at least a little cleaner and better for people whose situation is now bad and must otherwise steadily worsen before they can be provided with new houses.57. It is the Governmenfs intention, therefore, so to amend the Housing Actsas to enable these operations to be carried out. Briefly what is required is to enable a local authority while taking exactly the action under the Acts which leads nor-mally to demolition (declaration of an area submission to the Minister of a com-pulsory purchase order Ministers inquiry and decision), to defer demolition until they can carry the process to its proper conclusion. And just as slum houses which are bought for immediate demolition are bought at site value, so will thesehouses which are bought with a view to temporary repair pending ultimatedemolition be bought at site value.58. This interim stage in the treatment of slums will be an integral part ofeach local authority&apos;s programme wherever it is not possible to replace anddemolish all the unfit areas in their district within, say, 5 years. Accordinglyauthorities will be asked to set out in their programmes, in addition to their pro-posals for demolition and replacement, what they think it will be practicable forthem to do by way of acquiring areas which they cannot clear within 5 years,with the object of carrying out such repair and decoration as are reasonably practicable.59. It is recognised that this will place an administrative burden on many local authorities, and not by any means exclusively on the larger authorities whoare better staffed to undertake it. Ideally it would mean that each authority dealtwith the sum total of their unfit areas in 5 years, either permanently by demolitionor temporarily by repairs. Clearly that will be impracticable in many areas wherethe slum problem is as old as the Industrial Revolution. There will be a limit tothe number of houses it will be possible to acquire and repair in a single operation,and (as with the properties which are to be demolished without repair) it will benecessary to adopt a scheme of priorities on which acquisition for repair is toproceed.60. But whatever burden is involved this is a task which every local authority must face wherever they are forced to leave people in unfit houses with no reasomably early prospect of rehousing. It is a responsibility this temporary care of3lum-dwellings which the Minister of Housing and Local Government will sharewith the local authority by the approval he gives to their programme; and theywill have the support of all who favour a practical and realistic approach to theproblem.61. Local authorities will be put to extra expense; and Parliament will beinvited to authorise additional grants for this purpose. It is proposed that partof the extra financial assistance should be towards the annual costs of amortisationof loans for the acquisition during the period that the properties continue to be occupied. (The present grant system already provides assistance towards there-development of a site after the properties have been demolished.) The. other part of the extra financial assistance should, it is proposed, take the form of a fixed annual sum for 15 years for each dwelling, or part dwelling in separateoccupation, towards the costs of bulk works of improvement and the subsequentannual maintenance and supervision. With some increase in; the rents, where theseare very low, as a contribution from the tenants, the Exchequer grant is designedto share the burden which would otherwise fall on the local authority. .   ,t;)
62. From the human angle the money and work involved in these operationswill be well expended. There should be countervailing savings on sickness, disease^human degradation and crime.Dilapidated Houses63. Some landlords may not be willing or able to bring their houses to thehighest standard-&quot; good and tenantable repair &quot; to which the permitted repairsincrease will be linked.64. They have nevertheless a statutory duty under the Housing Acts to keep their houses fit for human habitation and local authorities have powers under thesame Acts to require landlords to maintain their houses in that condition.65. If a local authority consider that a house is unfit for human habitationand can be made fit at a reasonable expense, they may require the owner to carryout the repairs needed to make it fit, or they may do the necessary repairs themselves and recover the cost from him.66. Comparatively little use has been made of these powers since the war,chiefly because post-war licensing control has in effect limited repairs to work ofa specially urgent nature and has largely ruled out the comprehensive repairs forwhich the powers are intended. That control has however been considerablyrelaxed and local authorities now have scope to use their powers more freely. It is part of the Governments comprehensive plan that they should do so.67. But the powers themselves need some improvement. For one thingalthough they are aimed at houses which are &quot; unfit for human habitation &quot; the term is not defined in the Housing Acts. The lack of a definition has led to a variety of decisions in the Courts on what unfitness means and consequently toa great deal of uncertainty about what work a local authority may require a land-lord to do in any particular case. It seems clear to the Government that a statutorydefinition would help both parties concerned, the local authority in framing its requirements and the landlord in deciding the extent of his responsibilities.68. The case for definition is supported in the recommendations of a Sub-Committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee which submitted a reportto the Minister of Health on &quot; Standards of Fitness &quot; in 1946. The Sub-Committeeincluded officers and members of local authorities with a long experience in thesematters. It examined a great mass of evidence on the operation of the existing law. Its conclusion was that a standard of fitness could and ought to be defined.The Government propose to amend the Housing Acts on the lines recommendedby the Sub-Committee in its report.69. Again, although the powers are confined to houses which are capable ofbeing made fit at &quot; reasonable expense &quot;, this term also is not defined and hasreceived different interpretations. The Government are considering a formula which would fix what is reasonable expense by reference to the expected life Ofthe house when repaired and the rent it should command during that life.70. Finally, the procedure by which a local authority may carry out the neces-sary repairs where the landlord is unwilling to do them, and recover the cost from him, does not always work well. Matty local authorities have complained that theprocess of recovering costs is slow and unsatisfactory, Proposals will be made forsimplifying the statutory procedure at this point.71. Summed Up, what it comes to is that landlords will be required to ensurethat the houses for which they are responsible are &quot; fit for human habitation &quot;where that can be done at reasonable cost. If a landlord fails to do this the localauthority will be expected to do it for him, and at his expense. If the house cannotbe made &quot; fit for human habitation &quot; at reasonable expense, it becomes a candidate for demolition and replacement; or under the proposals in this Paper for repair bythe local authority with the aid of Exchequer grants pending demolition, This isalready the intention of the law (excepting the proposal for temporary care pendingdemolition and the purpose of the amendments will be to clarify the law and makeit more effective.72. The landlord will not be entitled to any increase of rent where ail thathe does, Or the local authority do for him, is to make the house &quot; fit for human habitation.&quot; To qualify for the repairs increase he must go further and put thehouse in &quot; good and tenantable repair.&quot; The repairs increases proposed should enable landlords to make this extra effort, given the basic assumption that the housecan be made &quot; fit for human habitation at reasonable expense.&quot;
Improvements and Conversions73. If we are to prolong the useful life of as many houses as are worthkeeping there is more than repair work to be done.74. Many houses, while sound structurally and good for many years yet, areold and lack modern amenities-a bathroom, a hot water system, a water closet,or other services regarded to-day as necessities in proper housing accommoda-tion. Other houses-equally sound were built for another age and are too large for present day conditions. Some of them have been converted for occupation by a number of families, but converted badly without providing asatisfactory dwelling for each.   Some are standing empty.75. These two sorts of house the house that needs improving and the house that needs proper conversion are well on the road to permanent unfitness unless they can have the treatment they need.76. There is already available under the Housing Act, 1949 Exchequerassistance to owners who are prepared to improve or convert their property.Grants can be made of half the cost involved per dwelling (subject to a maximumgrant of  400) the conditions being that the scheme receives the approval of thelocal authority and the Minister of Housing and Local Government, that the househas an expected life of 30 years, and that when the work is done the house will reach a standard laid down by the Minister.77. The Act of 1949 regulates the rent that may be charged when the work is done. If the house was already let the new rent must not exceed the old by morethan 6 per cent, of that part of the cost of the work borne by the owner. If it wasnot let the local authority fix an appropriate rent.78. The Government have examined the operation of these provisions inorder to find out why they have proved so ineffective and what is the remedy.Little more than 3,000 dwellings have been improved with the aid of the grant and only 700 new dwellings created by conversion.79. It is clear in the first place that these facilities are not sufficiently weliknown. The Act of 1949 was passed at a time when licensing quotas made itdifficult to allow anything but the most urgent work of repair and maintenance.There was not much point, therefore, in giving special publicity to the grants at thattime, and many owners are still ignorant of their existence.80. There has also been criticism of the statutory conditions and theMinisters standard.81. A house must have an expected life of 30 years in order to qualify. Butif a house can be made to provide satisfactory living conditions for a shorter period,say 20 years, this is surely work which is well worth doing in our present housingneed. It is proposed, therefore, to alter this condition so that houses with a shorter period of expected life may be accepted.82. There must be also an adequate return on the money invested. 6 percent, is not enough in present conditions to induce owners to undertake this sort of work. The Government intend to raise the 6 per cent, to 8 per cent. In fixing the rent of a house not previously let local authorities will be required to take intoaccount the age and condition of the dwelling after the work has been carried out,and the money the owner has spent on doing it.83. Finally, the Ministers standard. The requirements which the minister has laid down are individually reasonable. But it would not be reasonable to insist on them all in all cases (e.g., where the necessary public services are lacking);in fact the Minister has always been willing to waive individual requirements wheregood reason could be shown,84. But this power of waiver has not been sufficiently appreciated by thepublic; and even some local authorities seem to have been applying the standardrigidly and rejecting proposals of real value which do not comply in every detail.85. Properly known and used these grants under the Act of 1949 can be an immense help in the preservation of the national stock of sound houses and inadapting them to modern needs,86. If this work of adapting and improving is not done it will mean prematuredecay for large numbers of houses. A nationwide programme of improvement andconversion could save them and extend their useful life for another generation orlonger. Two things are necessary: first, that house owners know of these grants and how to obtain them: second, that local authorities do their utmost to help44808 &quot; C 2
applicants and potential applicants for grant in framing acceptable proposals. TheGovernment propose to take action accordingly.87. There is one other deterrent to the conversion of houses into fiats. Underthe Rent Restrictions Act of 1938, when a dwelling house to which the Rent Actsapply is part of another dwelling house to which those Acts apply, the standardrent of the first-mentioned dwelling is ascertained by apportioning the standardrent of the second-mentioned dwelling. The Government propose that in future,in order to facilitate conversions, when there is a bona-fide reconstruction by wayof conversion into two or more separate and self-contained fiats, application maybe made to the Rent Tribunal for a determination of the rents it would be reason-able to charge for each of them.Legislation88. All these proposals represent, in the Governmenfs opinion, a com-prehensive and practicable plan for making the best use of the nation&apos;s houses.The necessary statutory powers will be sought in a Bill which will be introduced as early as possible next session.The Future89. It is apparent that the operations outlined in this Paper the repair,conversion and improvement of houses, the beginning of a new drive to clear theslums, and the continuation of new house-building will make a new demand onour resources. The physical means the labour and materials for carrying out all this work are not unlimited. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have successfullyencouraged the manufacturers of building materials to increase their production,and confidently rely on the continued co-operation of both the building and thebuilding materials industries in increasing output. This process, even in an expand-ing economy, takes time. The share of our national resources including money which can year by year be given to housing work in all its forms must obviouslydepend on the claims of other building. We cannot, therefore, expect to devote atleast at the start a substantially larger share to the housing programme in its new form than it enjoys to-day.90. It will be necessary therefore to balance one part of the housing programmeagainst another and to weigh the due proportion of effort to be put into each. Localauthorities will have to reconsider the proportion of their programme they candevote in future to general housing needs now that they will be concerned ona progressively increasing scale with the demolition and replacement of the slums.91. Private enterprise must play an ever increasing part in the provision ofhouses for general needs, and will continue to be given every encouragement that circumstances from time to time permit. Any increase in private enterprise house-building, whether for letting or for sale, would in some measure lighten the ever-growing burden of housing subsidies, the rates of which cannot continue indefinitelyat their present high level. Local authorities (including county councils) already have power under the Housing Acts to advance money to anyone wishing to build a new house or to buy an existing one; or to alter, enlarge, repair, or improvea house; or to buy buildings not already used as dwellings and convert them forsuch use. They also have power under the same Acts to guarantee the repayment of advances made by building societies for the buying or building of houses; and to guarantee an advance made by a building society for those purposes bigger thanthe society would advance in the ordinary course of business, the Exchequer sharingin any loss that may thereby be made. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are consultingboth the building societies and the local authorities with a view to improving thefacilities they offer and making them more widely known.92. Her Majesjty&apos;s Government believe that this comprehensive attack uponthe housing problem will commend itself to the great mass of the public as bothpractical and imaginative.93. The building of new houses is a vital part of the housing programme andis proceeding on an encouraging scale. But the maintenance and rescue of theexisting houses where possible, and their demolition and replacement where neces-sary must be embarked on as an urgent and compelling task. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment feel that they are setting out on a new and inspiring adventure. They areconscious of the difficulties and complexities. There is no quick and easy remedy for a long-standing evil. They are nevertheless fortified by the experience of thelast two years and aTe confident of the national response to a supreme national need.
