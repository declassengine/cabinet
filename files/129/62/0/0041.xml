^HHl-CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-??????1 I tW^^^ &amp; i^^^^HH&gt;C.(53) 241 CCPYNC,  3    HI I 24th AUGUST, 1953*CABINETANTARCTICAI Note by the Lord President of the CouncilI circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of a minute ^^^[I on Antarctica which I sent to the Prime Minister on 18th August.I Foreign Office, S.W.I.I            24th August, 1953. ^^fl[PRIME MINISTERANTARCTICA &apos;fl^lI have re-examined this question in the light of your minute M.238/53[to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and of the recent Cabinet Conclusions of[which the last was C.C.(53) 44th Conclusions, item 7, of July 21. Here[are my findings in which the Chancellor, the Colonial Secretary, the Minister[of Defence, the Commonwealth Secretary and the First Lord have concurred. ^^^[2. Three courses are open to us:- ^^^[I (i) we can maintain our claim to the whole of our sector.   But in orderto do so we must be prepared to find the money, men and equipment ^^^flneeded to make it good; or ^^^H(ii) we can reduce our commitment to a size which we can effectivelydefend with our existing resources; or again ^^^J(iii) we can, as you suggest, go on as we are. ^^^[I 3.    I must advise strongly against course (iii).  Already there are twice asInany foreign bases on the territory we claim as there are British, and with each ^^^[| Lear the position worsens.  Not only are we losing possession and consequently ^^^[L^H   I prestige, but our title itself is being weakened, even to those parts to whichL^H   I mnr claim *s strongest*   This process, left unchecked, can only end in ourb^H   L Exclusion from the Antarctic.   In the meanwhile we face the certainty ofIvb^H ? Incidents with Argentina and Chile and in this area, so remote from us, yet ^^^[mn their very doorstep, we expose ourselves to the risk of humiliation at ^^^Hveir hands* ^^^Hb^b^LwbV b^b^b^Lwb.
4. Ideally we should wish to adopt course (i) and avoid abating ourclaims until we were sure that we were giving up nothing of value.   But todo this we should have to spend an estimated  v million in addition to ourpresent expenditure, together with an increased naval effort, includingespecially strengthened ships*  After consulting the Chancellor and the&apos;V        First Lord and in the light of the advice of the Chiefs of Staff thatstrategically our needs are met by the retention of the Falkland Islands, Iam satisfied that course (i) would not be justified.5. The alternative (course (ii)) is to reduce our commitment. Thisshould not cause us any great anxiety.   Cur sector is uninhabited. Iunderstand that our legal rights to large parts of the area are extremely shaky.Indeed, we have always known that our claims could not survive intact ifour offer to go to the International Court were accepted.   Many Governments,including the United States Government, do not recognise our rights. Anegotiated settlement now would enable us to cut our losses at little realsacrifice.   It should be possible to avoid any appearance of a cession orsurrender of British territory by making it clear that sovereignty inthis wide and remote area has always been Undefined and that what we are nowendeavouring to do is to put the whole position upon a stable and agreed basisand so avoid undignified squabbles and troublesome incidents in the future.It is conceivable, as you say, that there may be some mineral wealth in thearea, but, if so, most of it would be concealed under an immensely thick layerof ice.   Even in the Graham Land peninsula, where the land surface is inplaces more accessible, it is very problematical whether any mineralsfound could be exploited economically,6. Argentina and Chile have both hinted that they would be preparedto negotiate and it is now for us to respond if we so wish.  I recommend thatwe should, as a next step, take soundings confidentially to see what sort ofan arrangement they have in mind.   The Cabinet could then decide in the lightof the reaction we get, whether we should go further.   There could, of course,in any case be no question of discussing the Falkland Islands, and this wouldbe made clear from the start.   We should naturally tell the old Dominionswhat we propose.18th August, 1953,
