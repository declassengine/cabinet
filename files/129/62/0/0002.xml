IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALC.(53) 202 COPY NO.20TH JULY, 1953CABINETPROPOSED INTERNATIONAL SUGAR COUNCILPRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Minister of FoodAn International Conference is now meeting in London to negotiate anew International Sugar Agreement to regulate the world trade in sugar.    Withthe authority of the Economic Policy Committee (E.A.(5 3) 20th Meeting, Item 2)the United Kingdom delegation has been instructed to support the conclusion ofan agreement.Seat of the council.        It is proposed to establish a Council to operate the Agreement,    TheUnited Kingdom will be a member.    For the following reasons I think we should press for London to be the seat of the Council:-(a) the existing Council has been located in London ever since it was established under the International Sugar Agree-ment of 1937, and to establish the new Council elsewhere,e. g. in New York, might hinder the efforts of Britishtraders to re-establish the importance of London as a centre of the world trade in sugar;(b) we shall secure thereby that the expenses of the UnitedKingdom and Commonwealth representatives will be kept to a minimum and incurred wholly in sterling;(c) the contributions of foreign members to the Councils funds and the expenses of foreign delegates to the council will bring in foreign currencies, including dollars, tothe United Kingdom.Privileges and Immunities3.        Article 39(6) of the draft Agreement which is being taken as the basis for the negotiations at the present Conference runs as follows&quot;the Government of the country where the seat of the councils situated shall grant exemption from taxation on the salariespaid by the Council to its employees and shall accord to theCouncil and to its personnel and staff the same privileges and immunities as would be accorded by it to the personnel and staff&apos;of a specialised agency of the United Nations&quot;,
4.        The extent of the privileges and immunities which we are prepared togrant to the Council may influence the Conference in the choice of London as its permanent home.    I would, hope, however, that it would, not be necessaryfor this purpose to grant the Council the whole of the exemptions, privileges and immunities envisaged in the draft Agreement as it now stands.    I there-&quot;fore propose that they should be as follows:-(a) the Council shall have the legal capacity of a body corporate;(b) the funds of the Council shall be exempt from taxation;(c) all employees of the Council except citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies shall enjoy exemption from income tax in respect of emoluments receivedby them as officers or servants of the Council.5.        I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree:-(a) that the United Kingdom delegation shall press for the seat of the Council to be in London;(b) that the United Kingdom delegation shall be authorisedto inform the Conference that if the Council&apos;s seat isto be in London Her Majesty&apos;s Government will takethe necessary legislative measures to grant theCouncil the privileges listed in paragraph 4 above;and(c) that an Order in Council shall accordingly be prepared tobe laid before Parliament when the International sugar agreement has been signed.Ministry of Food, 5. W.l.20TH JULY, 1953.
