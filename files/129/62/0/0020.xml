Printed for. the Cabinet.   July 19.53CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 22028th July, 1953c \bi\ktHOUSES OF PARLIAMENT: MEMBERS&apos; REMUNERATIONMemorandum by Lord President of the council I am rather perturbed by the Cabinefs decision to set up a Select Committeeon the remuneration of Members of the House of Commons (C.C. (53) 4.1st Con-clusions, Minute 2) without any reference to the position of peers. I really thinkthat the situation of the House of Lords ought now also to come under review.2. Again and again, under pressure from the back benches of the House ofCommons, the salaries of members have been raised, and they now stand at  1,000a year plus travelling expenses. Moreover, the  1,000 a year, owing to the possi-bility of reclaiming expenses, is largely free of tax. But even this, we are now told,is inadequate to enable members of the House of Commons to do their work,and they are asking for more. Yet during the whole of this period, no provision has been made for peers, who, as before, receive no salary or expense allowance,but only their railway tickets from their homes to Parliament; and that is onlya very small fraction of the expenditure in which they are involved.3. And yet, by and large, peers are nowadays no better off than members ofParliament. If sometimes but not very often they have larger gross incomes,these are more than swallowed up by higher direct taxation and heavier commit-ments. I have had urgent representations on this subject from peers in all partsof the House, who have stressed that the point has now been reached when it isno longer possible for them to perform their constitutional duties. This I know,in many cases, to be true. Indeed, I believe one of the main causes of the badattendance which reflects so seriously on the reputation of the House is that anumber of peers who would like to come simply cannot afford it. We are, I suppose, the only legislative body in the world to-day which is expected to giveall its work free.4. I don&apos;t suggest that peers should receive a salary. That, I fully appreciate,might raise very serious difficulties for the Government, and many of the peersthemselves would not like it. Moreover, they would not wish to ask for anything like what is being paid to the House of Commons. They realise fully that, withoutconstituencies, they are not involved in the same expenditure as Members of theother House. What I suggest is that they might receive an expense allowance forthe days on which they attend the House.5. As a guide to what expenditure might be involved I give the following figures for the year October, 1951 to July, 1952. This was a pretty average year.The total sittings of the House during the period were 101, and the average numberof peers attending on each sitting day was 89. I suggest that, under the schemewhich I recommend, the allowance which a peer might receive might properly be 2 a day, if free of tax, or  4 a day, if liable to tax. No doubt the number of peersattending under a scheme of this kind might be higher than at present; but it iscertainly unlikely to be more than 200, and it might well be considerably less. Atthe higher number, and taking the figures which I have mentioned for the allowance,the total cost to the Treasury could not conceivably be more than  40,000 per year,if the allowances are tax free or, if they are liable to tax,  80,000, of which theChancellor would get back at least  50,000.44590Copy No.
6. I hope very much that the Cabinet will consider this proposal. It would only cost the country a fraction of what it is spending on the House of Commons,and it is really vital if the House of Lords&quot; is to,do its job. If it would facilitateaction, I should be very ready that a Select Committee should be set up, on thelines of that which is in contemplation for the House of Commons. In conclusion,I would say this. If the Peers see that the Commons are to have -another rise andthat they themselves are to remain once again entirely neglected, they will becomerightly resentful, and may well tend to become less and less assiduous in theirattendance: and, frankly, I should not blame them. I therefore beg my colleagues to give urgent consideration to my proposal.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,27th July, 1953.
