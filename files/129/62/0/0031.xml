SECRET Copy No.     6 4C. (53) 23113th August, 1953CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS: REDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Home secretary i was asked at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 28th July to circulate a memo-randum explaining the basis and character of the forthcoming review of constituencies (C.C. (53) 46th Conclusions, Minute 9).2. Before 1944 there was no standing machinery for redistribution: Parlia-ment decided on reviews at long intervals when discrepancies had becomeintolerable; a commission was set up ad hoc, and effect was given to its recom-mendations by Act.  The last such redistribution was in 1918.3. In 1944 on the recommendation of the Speakers Conference an Act waspassed setting up four permanent Boundary Commissions under the Speaker. TheAct provided for the immediate division of a number of abnormally largeconstituencies (this was done in time for the general election of 1945), followedby an initial general review, the results of which were to be given effect by Act,and thereafter by further general reviews at regular intervals, the results of whichwere to be given effect by Order in Council.4. The initial general review was begun in 1946, was suspended while an act was passed, by agreement between the Parties, to amend the rules for redistribution-tribution to remove defects which had become apparent, and was completed in1947. The Commissions&apos; recommendations were given effect, with some changes,in the Representation of the People Act, 1948.5. The Act of 1944 and the amending Act of 1947 were consolidated in theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, which now operates.Section 2 (2) requires each Boundary Commission to submit general reports at intervals of from three to seven years, subject to a proviso which requires thata report stating that no alteration is required in the part of the United kingdom with which a Commission is concerned must not be submitted after an interval of less than six years. The date by which the next general reports must be sub-mitted is the 30th July, 1955, but a report recommending no change must not besubmitted before 30th July, 1954. The Commissions for England, Scotland andWales are to start their next general reviews now.6. The Commissions&apos; procedure is laid down in Section 2 and the first schedule to the Act, and the rules for redistribution of seats in the Second Schedule.A copy of the rules is attached. The total number of constituencies is limited;local government boundaries are to. be followed so far as is practicable without causing excessive disparities between electorates; subject to these requirementsthe electorates of constituencies are to be as nearly equal as is practicable; but aCommission may depart from these rules if special geographical considerationsmake this desirable (this allows large rural constituencies in general to have smallerelectorates than compact urban constituencies).44672Printed for the Cabinet.

7.   There are two main stages in the procedure First, when a Commission have provisionally determined on recom-mendations, they are required to publish their proposed recommendations in each constituency concerned. A month is allowed for representations tobe made to the Commission, and the Commission may cause a local inquiry to be held.  The right to make representations is not restricted in any way.Next, the Commission have to submit their report to the Home Secretary,or in the case of the Scottish Commission to the Secretary of State forScotland. Section 2(5) requires the Secretary of State concerned to submit the report to Parliament as soon as may be, together with the drafts of orders in Council giving effect to its recommendations, with or without modifications.If any modifications are proposed, the Secretary of State must at the sametime present a statement of the reasons for them.8. The draft Orders in Council have to be approved by both Houses ofParliament. If a Motion for approval is rejected by either House, or withdrawnby leave of the House, the Secretary of State may present an amended draft forapproval by both Houses.9.   The redistribution takes effect at the ensuing general election.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W.1,11th August, 1953.Rules for Redistribution of Seats1.
