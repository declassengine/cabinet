(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP PIER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETf0.(53) 221 COPY NO.   jg C;29TH JULY. 1955CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs.AND trade memorandum BY THE PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF TRADE *In September next I shall be attending the Eighth Sessionof the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) at Geneva. - I am anxious to obtain cabinet authority for the line I propose to take on the subject of japan and G.A.T.T.    The matter is now urgent as each week thatelapses without that authority being given leaves less time formobilising support for the line we decide to take.2.     I set out my views in C.(53) 137.    I still adhere to them.It is against this country1s interest that Japan should enter the G.A.T.T.    It will do substantial damage to our export tradeif she does so.   We may not be able to prevent her doing so forever, but provided we make up our rnind to try we have a good chance of postponing her entry for a considerable time.3.     The United States at this moment have given no assurancewhatever that their current review of commercial policy will result in any large measure of liberalisation and have in any event stated publicly that they cannot enter into tariff negotiations with anybody.    In such circumstances it is verydifficult to see how Japan could enter the G.A.T.T,    I am quite clear that for us to support her entry with so many factorsunknown is a course which I personally could not support.L.     I agree with the conclusions of the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations.    I cannot accept the suggestion of theEconomic Secretary that we should endorse a safeguard underArticle XXIII of G.A.T.T.    I consider that such a safeguard wouldbe worth very little in practice;    and it would in any eventonly become relevant to consider it at a time when Japan&apos;s entry into G.A.T.T. could come before us in more definite terms.There really is no need now to say what we would do about all this in 1955 or 1956.5.     I accordingly ask for authority to play for time, and to refrain at the forthcoming conference from supporting Japan&apos;sentry into G.A.T.T. or from defining in advance our attitudetowards it.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.128TH JULY, 1953-
