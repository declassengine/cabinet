1x7DRAFT REPLY TO THE SOVIET NOTES 6f AUGUST 4 AND AUGUST 15.............................................-on four-POWER TALKS AND GERMANY.................................:......:-ffltfl. HeiCMajesty&apos;s Government understand from the Soviet Governments; com-munication of August 4 that the Soviet Government are now prepared to participate in a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the four Powers sharing certain! resppnsi-bilities in regard to Germany to discuss the German question.--They, have sincereceived the Soviet Government^ second note of August 15 in which the SovietGovernment express the view, which has long been held by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, that a German settlement is overdue. They have been glad to take note ofthis and they trust that the Soviet Government are now ready to participate in ameeting of the four Foreign Ministers, which, Her Majesty&apos;s Government suggest,should be held at [Geneva] on October 15 next. They understand that this wouldbe agreeable to the Swiss Government.2. In their note of August 4 the Soviet Government have however made theadditional suggestion that the four Foreign Ministers should also discuss other measures for the reduction of tension in international relations, taking into account a number of considerations set out in the introductory paragraphs of that note.Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to join in a general review by the fourForeign Ministers of the world situation in broad terms, although this should not be interpreted as an acceptance, even by implication, of the assumptions and assertionson a wide variety of topics contained in the Soviet notes of August 4 and August 15.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the proposed meeting of the fourForeign Ministers will make the best contribution to an improvement in the situationif it concerns itself mainly with the German question. The other important prob-lems mentioned in the Soviet Governments note of August 4 which would naturally be touched upon in any general survey, i.e., the reduction of armaments and important current questions in Asia, including the position of China, are alreadyentrusted to established organisations such as the United Nations or to bodiesrecently set up, such as the Political Conference on Korea, where the chinese people&apos;s&apos;^ Republic will be represented.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that a solution of the german problem would contribute more than any other single factor to a general relaxation-tion of tension in Europe, just as a Korean settlement, which will be discussed atthe Political Conference, should lead the way to a similar reduction of tension in asia. They are glad to note that the Soviet Government, too, now consider that early agreement on the German question will &quot; promote a lessening of tension in international relations, and thus contribute to strengthening peace and inter-national security.&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government themselves remain of the opinionthat German reunification can only be achieved in conditions of freedom throughfree elections in the Federal Republic, the East Zone of Germany and in Berlin,and that a peace treaty can only be negotiated with a free, all-German Government,formed as a result of such elections and itself enjoying freedom of action in internal and external affairs. But this need not preclude the four Foreign Ministers fromdiscussing all aspects of the problem of German unity nor even from consideringthe general principles of a German peace treaty. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that progress is more likely to be made by discussion of the german problem at the proposed meeting of Foreign Ministers in [Geneva] than by afurther exchange of notes, They do not therefore propose to comment now uponthe individual issues raised in the Soviet note of August 15 beyond generallyreserving their position, which has often been made clear in the past.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Government trust that, as a result of the notes exchangedseparately and of the proposed further discussions by the Austrian Deputies, thefour Foreign Ministers will also be able at [Geneva] finally to agree upon anAustrian State Treaty. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not, however, prepared toaccept the suggestion in the concluding paragraph of the Soviet note of August 4that a solution of the Austrian question is dependent upon progress towards asolution of the German problem. Her majesty&apos;s Government consider that thesetwo problems are quite distinct. In their view nothing need now prevent theconclusion of an Austrian Treaty at a very early date.
UNITED STATES DRAFT REPLY TO SOVIET NOTE OF AUGUST 4Presents its compliments &amp;c.2. In its Note of July 15 the United States Government proposed a meetingof the Foreign Ministers of France, United Kingdom, United States and the soviet union to discuss the German question, including the reunification of Germany,the holding of free elections, the establishment of a free all-German Government,and the peace treaty, as well as agreement on the Austrian treaty.3. The Soviet reply of August&apos;4. is devoted largely to the theme that theChinese People&apos;s Republic should be brought into the discussions as a government having &quot;legitimate rights in all international affairs.&quot; The German problem hasbeen a subject of discussion at Four Power meetings since 1947, but never beforehas there been any suggestion of Chinese participation. The status of the so-calledChinese People&apos;s Republic is itself a matter of serious international controversyand it has no recognized competence in German affairs. The United StatesGovernment finds totally unacceptable and rejects the suggestion that the chinese communist regime is entitled to participate in the discussion of the problem ofGerman unification, or that discussion of the problem of Germany be subordinate to the solution of the problem of China.4. Real progress toward peace and the lessening of international tensionscan be made by the solution of immediate concrete problems, such as the german problem, and the injection into the discussion and solution of such problems ofnumerous other complicated issues can only result in delay and possible failure.The United States Government seeks by all means at its disposal to find solutionsfor problems which lie at the base of international tensions, but it does not believethat progress can be made within a framework permitting only superficial con-sideration to important questions. In this connection the United StatesGovernment would remind the Soviet Government of a statement contained inan editorial published on May 24, 1953 in Pravda, widely believed to be an authoritative source of Soviet official opinion, which appears to endorse the viewsof the United States Government in this regard. Pointing out that &quot; the present international situation is known for great complexity of its outstanding problems &quot;Pravda expresses the opinion that &quot; an attempt to discuss and solve all controversialoutstanding problems at once would end in failure&quot; and added that &quot; a move forward in the settlement of such sore problems as the problem of the war in Koreaor the problem of Germany could help to ease the tension hi the present international situation and prepare the soil for the settlement of other problems.&quot;5. The Korean Conference to achieve by peaceful means the,unification ofa free and independent Korea and the work of the United Nations disarmament commission, charged with the important task of the reduction of armaments, areconcrete examples of the present existence of opportunities for the lessening of world tensions and the advancement of peace and means that should be availedof to that end. The solution of the German problem and j the conclusion of theAustrian treaty will be major steps toward the achievement of peace and will furnish a firm foundation for the solution of other international problems. They should therefore not be delayed or hindered by extraneous issues.6. The Government of the United States welcomes the statement that theSoviet Government attaches importance to the joint consideration of the Germanquestion by the four Powers and in response to the United States note of July 15agrees to examine the German question at a Conference of Ministers: For its part,the Government of the United States fully shares the hope that such consideration will make it possible ;to examine thoroughly the pertinent problems,.relating ,to therestoration of German unity and the question of a peace treaty With Germany, asi a contribution to; the strengthening of peace in Europe..     ;:   0 a,; ;x-,. 7/ The Government of the United States therefore proposes&apos; that the Foreign, Ministers of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, France and the United: %afes meet atGeneva (or in some other mutually agreeable location in Swftz^riandJVoh October 1,... 1953, and if. this is -agreeable;, will &quot;communicate with the; Government of the SwissRepublic to ascertain whether the Four Powers may take&quot; advantage of its tradi-tional hospitality and to make the5necessary arrangements.&apos; :&apos; &apos;   --&apos; &apos;:o44709 B 2
8. This Government is of the opinion that in examining all relevant aspectsof the German question, including the restoration of German unity and a peace treaty, the Four. Powers should not fail to take any practical step which would serve as a means towards these ends, or which would in any event constitute integralparts of a solution of the German problem. As expressed in its note of July 15,1953, the Government of the United States considers free elections and the consti-tution of a free all-German Government, in response to the clearly expressedwishes of all Germans, to be a practical and fundamental point of departure. Whichwould most facilitate reunification and the negotiation of a German peace treaty.&apos; 9. With respect to Austria, the Government of the United States has never been of the opinion that the re-establishment of the freedom and independence ofthis liberated country, as required by the Moscow Declaration of November 1943,should be subordinated to the German question. This Government believes thatthe solution of any one of the major outstanding international questions has areciprocally beneficial effect on the possibility of solving others, and with thisthought in mind has invited the Soviet Union by a note dated.........to a Conference of Deputies for the Austrian State Treaty to be held in London on. .... . :. . .  This Government believes that world opinion would find the bestaugur for the success of the following conference on Germany in the speedyconclusion of the Austrian State Treaty.10. The Government of the United States is surprised that the Soviet Gov-ernment should misinterpret as inadmissible collusion the initiative taken by theForeign Ministers of the United States, United Kingdom and France at their recent meeting in Washington. As is their custom and right, the three Ministersconsidered questions of mutual interest in the development of a prosperous and secure European Community between nations manifesting a willingness toco-operate towards that end.MOSCOW TELEGRAM No. 598My immediately preceding telegram: Soviet German treaty note of August .15.This morning&apos;s Pravda publishes full text of Soviet note, including the annexwhich is a repetition of the ;* fundamentals of a peace treaty with Germany &quot;contained in the Soviet note of March .10, 1952.2. At the same time Pravda reports that on August .15 (i.e., the date of the note) Soviet Government invited the East German Government to send represen-tatives to Moscow on August 20 to discuss their relations with the Soviet union and certain questions affecting Germany as a whole.3. Nothing in this latest note holds out any hope of progress towards aGerman settlement. Soviet Government seem to be bankrupt of ideas on Germany,and there seems to be no prospect of fruitful discussion. For that reason I conclude that note is intended to create a diversion and cause confusion at the moment whenWest German elections are imminent and the Western Powers are due to answerSoviet note of August 4 on Four-Power meeting. It may be an attempt to regainthe initiative, and possibly to induce us on the eve of the elections to prejudiceAdenauer&apos;s prospects by rejecting these proposals in a manner which could be usedin propaganda against us. On the other hand, to accept the course of action proposed in the Soviet note would be to create great confusion. This confusionwould, no doubt, be heightened by the propaganda which the East Germans and russians will now presumably concert, and by the participation in the proposedpreliminaries for the peace conference of all the States which fought againstGermany. It would reach its peak, according to the Soviet schedule, six monthshence, when the political conference on Korea will be approaching the Americantime-limit. This may be the dilemma from which the Soviet Government stillhope to gain some profit.
no. The Soviet Government may well have felt that their note of August 4was received adversely, even in the circles inclined to give the Soviet case the benefitof the doubt; and that it had created the unintended impression that the Sovietsthemselves were wrecking the prospect of talks on Germany. The present note,therefore, calls vigorously for a German peace conference, but any misgivingswhich this prospect might cause behind the Iron Curtain and especially in eastern germany are allayed by the note&apos;s entire orthodoxy in tone and substance, andby the invitation to Moscow of an East German governmental delegation.5. Since the note promises no change of policy in any matter of substance, I attach no value to its admission that the lapse of time since Potsdam requires thatsubsequent changes be taken into account. The fact that the draft treaty proposalsof March 1952 are resubmitted unchanged itself illustrates how little Soviet viewshave evolved.6. The Soviet Government have admittedly changed the order of priority forthe consideration of the three main issues, i.e., the drafting of a treaty, theelection of an all-German Government and the holding of the peace conference.This seems to be a tactical change to facilitate the appointment of a provisional all-German Government without elections. The result would be an unrepresentativeGovernment charged with the preparation of an electoral law in which the four powers would have no say.7. As regards the points of propaganda in the note, the only novelty consists of the proposed financial alleviations. These will, no doubt, be one of the matters for discussion with the East Germans in Moscow this week. The proposals seemto have a dual purpose, firstly to promise to the East Germans treatment as favour-able as that generally now enjoyed by the West Germans and secondly to assure theWest Germans that they will not lose their present advantages if they abandon theBonn Conventions.
