THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1953, CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   gC. (53) 20522nd July, 1953CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service at its 36th Session held in Geneva from 4th to 25th June the InternationalLabour Conference adopted an Instrument for the Amendment of the Constitutionof the International Labour Organisation.2. The main effect of the proposed. Amendment of the Constitution is toincrease the size of the Governing Body from 32 to 40 members. The presentcomposition of the Governing Body is as follows:  Government Members (a) States of Chief Industrial Importance       8(b) Elected States............       8- 16Employers&apos; Members  ...      ...      ...      ... 8Workers&apos; Members     ............ 8.. . 32&apos;As the result of the Amendment to the Constitution which the Conferenceadopted the composition will be as follows:  Government Members (a) States of Chief Industrial Importance      10(b) Elected States............      10.        &apos; - 20Employers&apos; Members ...      ...      ...... 10Workers&apos; Members     ...      ...      ...... 1040There are some other amendments of slight importance.3. The essential reason for the adoption of the Amendment was the resump-tion of membership of the Organisation by Germany and Japan in 1951. both countries were formerly members of the Governing Body as States of chief indus-trial importance. Their present eligibility to be considered for Governing Bodymembership in that capacity cannot on any criteria of industrial importance be denied and there is little doubt that they will qualify for membership among thefirst eight States of chief industrial importance, when the periodical review of thatcategory of States takes place in the course of the next twelve months. their inclusion as such would, however, mean the displacement of two of the existingStates of chief industrial importance with consequential repercussions among the elected Government members and the risk of great dissatisfaction among theGovernments affected. The Amendment adopted anticipates this situation andalso tends to minimise the danger of later demands for constitutional amendments of a more far-reaching character in which the provision for non-elective appoint-ments by Members of chief industrial importance, of whom the United kingdom is one, might be called into question.44529
4. For these reasons I regard this as a necessary and desirable Amendment.The United Kingdom Government Delegation supported it at the Conference,which adopted the Instrument of A.mendment without a dissenting vote. I proposethat Her Majesty&apos;s Government should now ratify the Instrument of Amendment.5. The Conference also adopted a resolution inviting States Members toendeavour to ratify the Instrument of Amendment as rapidly as possible so thatit may come into force before June 1954. In order to do so it must be ratified by two-thirds of the Members, including five of the present eight States of chief industrial importance. The importance of bringing the Instrument into force before june, 1954, is that, at the Session of the Conference which will then be held, thenext triennial elections for the Governing Body will take place and it is desirablethat they should be conducted on the new basis of membership. Early ratification by Her Majesty&apos;s Government may be expected to stimulate ratifications by otherGovernments.6. If the Cabinet agree, I should like authority to issue a White Paper in theterms of the draft appended to this paper.W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,21st July, 1953.appendix draft White PaperInternational Labour conference proposed Action by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland regarding the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation Instrument of Amendment, 1953At its 36th Session held in Geneva the International Labour Conferenceadopted on 25th June, 1953, an Instrument for the amendment of the Constitutionof the International Labour Organisation. The text of the Instrument of Amend-ment is set out in the Annex to this paper.The main effect of the Instrument of Amendment is to bring about a limitedincrease in the size of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office.Article 7 of the Constitution at present in force provides for a Governing body consisting of thirty-two members. Eight of these are Government members appointed by the States Members of chief industrial importance, eight are Govern-ment members selected for that purpose by the Government Delegates to the Con-ference, eight represent the Employers and are elected by the Employers&apos; delegates to the Conference and eight represent the Workers and are elected by the Workers&apos;Delegates to the Conference. The effect of the amendment is to increase these numbers in all cases from eight to ten, making a total membership of forty members.The general purpose of the proposed increase in the size of the governing body is to ensure that its composition corresponds to the growth of the Organi-sation and effectively represents the wider range of interests which now take partin its work. The number of States Members of the Organisation, which was 43 at its foundation in 1919, has now increased to 66 and the composition of theGoverning Body has not been revised since 1922. The small increase now proposedis designed to preserve the character of the Governing Body as the executive bodyof the Organisation and to maintain the existing balance between the differentgroups represented.The Instrument of Amendment also increases from twelve to sixteen thenumber of members at whose written request a special meeting of the governing body must be held, and removes an out-dated provision that the government representatives on the Governing Body should include representatives of six non-European States.
The Instrument of Amendment will come into force when, as required by article 36 of the Constitution, it has been ratified or accepted by two-thirds of the member States, including five of the eight States which, under the current provisionsof the Constitution, are represented on the Governing Body as Members of chief industrial importance. The Conference at its recent Session also adopted aresolution inviting all States Members to ratify the Instrument of Amendment as rapidly as possible so that it may come into force before June, 1954, when at the session of the Conference then to be held the next triennial elections to theGoverning Body are due to take place.Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose to ratify the Instrument of Amendment.ANNEXInstrument for the Amendment of the Constitution of the InternationalLabour organisation the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office, and having met in its Thirty-sixth Session on 4 June 1953;andHaving decided to substitute, in the provisions of the Constitution of theOrganisation relating to membership of the Governing Body, the numbers&quot; forty &quot;, &quot; twenty &quot;, &quot; sixteen &quot; and &quot; ten &quot; for the numbers &quot; thirty-two &quot;,&quot; sixteen &quot;, &quot; twelve &quot; and &quot; eight&quot;, a question which is the eighth item onthe agenda of the session,adopts this twenty-fifth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-three the following Instrument for the amendment of the Constitution of theInternational Labour Organisation, which may be cited as the Constitution of theInternational Labour Organisation Instrument of Amendment, 1953.Article 1In the text of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation as atpresent in force the numbers &quot; forty &quot;, &quot; twenty &quot;, &quot; sixteen &quot; and &quot; ten &quot; respectivelyshall be substituted for the numbers &quot; thirty-two &quot;, &quot; sixteen&quot;, &quot; twelve&quot; and&quot; eight &quot; contained in paragraphs 1, 2 and 8 of Article 7 and in Article 36.Article in the text of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation as atpresent in force the last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 7 shall be deleted.Article 3As from the date of the coming into force of this Instrument of Amendment,the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation shall have effect asamended in accordance with the preceding articles.Article 4On the coming into force of this Instrument of Amendment the Director-General of the International Labour Office shall cause an official text of theConstitution of the International Labour Oganisation as modified by the provisionsof this Instrument of Amendment to be prepared in two original copies, dulyauthenticated by his signature.
