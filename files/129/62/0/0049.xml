C. (53) 49th Conclusions,Minute 2), there have been three more meetings with the Egyptians.2.     The upshot of these is as follows:-Technicians and Duration of Agreement(i)  We have tried to obtain a ten-year agreement and the delegation were authorised to go so far as to offeran agreement of this duration consisting of -(a) eighteen months during whichcombatant troops would be with-drawn;(b) three years with 4,000 Britishtechnicians;(c) two years with 3,000 technicians;(d) three and a half years with a smaller number of technicians orinspectors.(ii)   The Egyptians will not accept a ten-year agreement.But the Delegation think that they might be induced to accept a seven-year agreement made up of:-(a) eighteen months for withdrawal ofcombatant troops;(b) three further years with 4,000technicians;(c) two and a half years with a smaller number of technicians or inspectors.(iii)    It is of interest that the United States Government havenever thought that we would get more than a five-year agreement: Nuri Pasha, who has been attending theArab League meetings for Iraq, told General Robertsonon 3rd September (Cairo telegram No. 1266), afterconversations with Egyptians, that he thought wecould get and should accept seven years.
(iv) Although we have not yet discussed drafts with the egyptians, there is general agreement between us and them that the Base would be madeavailable(a) in the event of United Nationsaction to resist an act of aggression;(b) in the event of an attack on any country member of the Arab MutualSecurity Pact.(v)  The Egyptians will not accept:-(a) reactivation &quot;in the event of a major war&quot;;(b) automatic reactivation in the eventof attacks upon Turkey or Persia.(vi)  We have not yet agreed that there should be provision in our agreement for consultation only, in the eventof an attack on Turkey.    We have consulted theTurkish Government and they have left the matter to our discretion.(vii) A new draft formula is attached.    It might be putforward as a basis of discussion at the next stage of our talks.3.     I would also draw attention to Cairo telegrams Nos. 1273 and 1276 which give the views of H. M. Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo on the background to these negotiations.    General Robertson is in general agreement with these views.A.N.Foreign Office, S. W.1,7TH SEPTEMBER, 1953.
