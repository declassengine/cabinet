(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)-secret.(53) 240 , COPY NO, Q24th AUGUST, 1953.CABINETJAPAN AND THEGENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.In his paper C. (53)239, the President of the Board of Trade,proposes that when the question of Japan&apos;s provisional association with the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) is raised we should, abstain andshould not ourselves be partyto such provisional association.      This goesbeyond&apos; the Cabinet decision of 30th July which was merely that v/e should seek to have the question of Japan&apos;s accession deferred.2.      If the Presidents suggestion were adopted we should in effect be openlyopposing Japanese association with the G.A.T.T.  It would therefore carry with it all the disadvantages of outright opposition to Japan which the Chancellor and I,or my  predecessors at the Foreign Office, have continually pointed out(see Minister of State&apos;s paper C. (53) 151).   From the strategic, political andeconomic point of view the effects would be bad and would affect our relationsboth with Japan and the United States, and would further divide theCommonwealth on an important economic issue.3.      I would therefore like to propose for the consideration of my colleaguesan alternative course which, while safeguarding the export interests which thePresident has in mind, would enable us to accept Japanese provisionalassociation.   My idea is that we should accept Japanese provisional association with the amplified &quot;Article XXIII safeguard&quot; and with a further provision which would enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government at anytime to discontinue theprovisional association between Japan and themselves.   This would not be an unreasonable requirement considering that Japan has not negotiated the termsof her association in the same way as the existing contracting parties, and it isone which I believe our delegation at Geneva could successfully put forward.The advantage of this course is that, since we could at any time revert to thestatus quo, we would in fact have the same freedom of action as we now have toprotect ourselves.   This should help us with Lancashire.   At the same time wewould avoid the international disadvantages of the Presidents suggestion and we would gain practical experience, in conditions in which we were fully safaguarded, of the advantages and disadvantages involved in having japan in the G.A.T.T.4.      I accordingly seek the agreement of my colleagues:-(a) that our delegation to Geneva should be instructed to accept Japaneseprovisional association on terms which included the Article XXIIIsafeguard offered by the Japanese, as amplified by theInter sessional Committee, and which permitted us to discontinue the provisional association at any time we wished;
(b) that this proposal should be canvassed with the other countrieconcerned forthwith, particularly the United States and theC ommonwe a 1th.Foreign Office, S.W.1,22nd August, 1953,
