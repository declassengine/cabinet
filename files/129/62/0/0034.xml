)X1Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1953SECRET Copy No.    13C. (53) 234   ,17th August, 1953CABINETA REVISED POLICY DIRECTIVE FOR THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATYORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilSince 1951 the defence planning of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.) has been based on the assumption that the risk of armed aggression by Russia against the West was imminent. The force requirements which formthe background to this planning are at present related to the year 1954, but newforce requirements, related to the year 1956 and taking into account the advent of new weapons, are now under consideration by the N.A.T.O. military authorities.2. N.A.T.O. force requirements are naturally based upon the assessment bythe responsible military authorities of the forces which they would need to dealwith a Russian attack against the West should such an attack take place. plans for building up N.A.T.O.&apos;s military strength have had as their ultimate objectthe attainment of the full force requirements. It was, however, recognised at avery early stage that there was no prospect of attaining these full requirementsat any predictable date, and the &quot; force goals &quot; adopted at the meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council held at Lisbon in February 1952 represented the utmostwhich it was then thought possible for countries to do having regard both to thenature of the risk and to the political and economic limitations on the efforts whichmember countries were capable of making.3. It was recognised in the 1952 Annual Review that the force goals adopted at Lisbon for the year 1954 would not be attained, and it has since become increasingly evident that the N.A.T.O. countries are now near to the maximumdefence effort which they can make without undermining their economies (somemay indeed already have gone beyond the maximum). With the inevitable taperingoff of American assistance the problem of maintaining in being the forces whichhave already been built up, largely with American equipment, will be extremelyformidable.4. The gap between &quot; force requirements &quot; and the forces which N.A.T.O.countries are actually capable of raising is likely if anything to increase, and thereis a risk that this may bring about a sense of frustration in N.A.T.O, At the sametime, events in recent months have led rightly or wrongly to a belief that the dangerof imminent armed aggression by Russia has in some degree decreased. This isleading some at least of the N.A.T.O. countries to think that the time has comefor them to relax. In this they are being encouraged by the determination of thenew United States Administration and Congress to reduce taxation and Govern-ment expenditure, which is bringing about cuts both in the United States&apos; own defence programme and in the amounts of money provided for foreign aid.5. The question therefore arises whether we ought not now to considerpossible changes in our approach to N.A.T.O.&apos;s future military policy. We mustnot of course call in doubt the validity of the forward strategy which is at presentaccepted N.A.T.O. military doctrine. To do so would not only weaken the resolu-tion of the more exposed N.A.T.O. countries, particularly Norway and Denmark,but would also put in jeopardy a German contribution to the N.A.T.O. defence forces, which it is essential to secure as soon as possible.   .44689
6. What seems to be required is that at its next meeting the North atlantic council, after approving the 1953 Annual Review, should face the new political andeconomic situation and adopt a policy on the following lines:  (a) In present conditions, the first priority must be to maintain N.A.T.O.v unity and strength over a prolonged period of tension in order tQcqnrtinue to deter Russia from armed aggression against the West. So longas an effective deterrent continues to be provided, the attainment of thefull N.A.T.O. force requirements becomes of less immediate&quot; urgency,though they must of course remain as the ideal military ^desiderata.v \(b) N.A.T.O.&apos;s objective should therefore be:  (i) to keep in being over a period of years forces, which, with atomic weapons always in the background, will provide an effectivedeterrent to Soviet attack and which countries can afford tomaintain and provide with up-to-date equipment;(ii) to improve the quality of those forces as resources permit;(iii) to add to these forces as soon as possible an effective german contribution;and (iv) to maintain our lead in the weapon and scientific field.(c) N.A.T.O. planning should be based on the assumption that roughly thepresent level of forces in aggregate, plus German forces, will be avail-able over the next few years; a necessary corollary being that theUnited States Government should recognise that the continuance of. end-item aid and off-shore procurement is essential to the maintenanceof effective N.A.T.O. defence.id) The foregoing principles should provide the basis for the 1954 annual review, whose main objects would be:: (i) to indicate how the present level of defence effort can be main-tained with the least damage to national economies;and (ii) to recommend how that effort should be directed in terms of quality and balance of forces in order to have the greatest deterrent effect on the Russians.7. If the North Atlantic Council is to be brought to accept such a changeOf approach, the initiative must in the first instance come from the United Kingdomand the U.S.A. Thus, the first step must be Anglo-American consultation. i suggest that this could best be begun by H.M. Ambassador in Washington. there could if necessary also be a brief meeting between United Kingdom and UnitedStates Ministers immediately before the North Atlantic Council meeting.8. I invite my colleagues to endorse the broad policy set out in thismemorandum, which takes into account the views of the Chiefs of Staff.Foreign Office, S.W.1,&quot;    14th August, 1953.
