(53) 12th Meeting, Item 1) I have,in consultation with the Admiralty, re-examined the proposal for holding biological^Ami warfare trials in the Bahamas.2.  My conclusions can be summarised as follows:-(i) The scientific data which these trials are designed to provide is of highmilitary importance.I (ii) Our scientists are in this field ahead /of the Americans, who attach much^^fl significance to the information to be obtained from these trials.^AWi (iii) The site for such trials must fulfil the following conditions:-(a) In order that the animals shall be in good condition, the climatemust be temperate.   (This excludes the tropics.)(b) It must be within reasonable distance by air from the animal farm^AWi and laboratories at Porton. (This effectively restricts the area^AWi of choice to the North Atlantic.)^AWi (c) There must be reasonably fine weather and steady moderate winds.^Ami (The only area of the North Atlantic under British control,^AWi where these conditions are obtainable, is among the more^AWi northerly islands of the West Indies, i.e., the Bahamas Group.)^Ami 3.  The site chosen after consultation with the Governor of the Bahamas,^Ami H  is an area of sea some 70 miles from Nassau which is unfrequented by shipping.^Ami It is surrounded on three sides by coral reefs, through which only small native^Ami craft can pass. There is no inhabited territory within 20 miles of the site.4. Under the excellent weather conditions in the Bahamas, it should be^^fl          possible to carry out in about 4 months a programme of trials which, if conductedjfe     in the Hebrides, could probably not be completed in under 5 years.5. In the light of this information, I hope that authorisation will be givenfor the proposed trials to be held in the Bahamas, beginning early in 1954.       - ,1; ^-WmW^M Ministry of Supply, W.C.2,6th August, 1953.
