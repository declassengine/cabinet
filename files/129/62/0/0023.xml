SECRET Copy No.   ^3C (53) 223   .7th August, 1953CABINETRESPONSIBILITY   FOR  ATOMIC   WEAPON   RESEARCHMemorandum by the Minister of supply the Report of the Waverley Committee suggests satisfactory solutions to mostof the administrative problems involved in the creation of an independentCorporation for Atomic Energy.2. There is, however, one point on which I consider that the Committeesproposals are unsound, namely the recommendation that the Atomic WeaponsResearch Establishment (with its Headquarters at Aldermaston) should betransferred along with the rest of the atomic energy organisation to the Corporation,and that the Ministry of Supply should cease to concern itself directly with thisvitally important breach of weapon development.Government Control over corporation . The Cabinefs decision to set up a Corporation was based primarily uponcivilian considerations. In particular, it was inspired by the desire to ensure thatthe development of this new source of industrial power should be carried out inthe closest collaboration with industry and that it should be subjected to no moreGovernment control than was absolutely necessary.4. If (apart from the production of fissile material for all purposes), theactivities of the Corporation were confined to the civil applications of atomic energy and basic nuclear research, it should be possible to give it a very large measure of freedom from governmental control. If, on the other hand, as theWaverley Committee propose, the Corporation were to be made responsible forthe development of weapons of mass destruction, Parliament and public opinion would expect the Government to maintain the closest control and to remain fullyanswerable for the Corporation^ actions thus largely defeating one of the mainpurposes for which the new organisation is being created.Avoidance of Political Controversy5. From the Parliamentary standpoint it is, of course, most desirable that thelegislation setting up the Corporation should, if possible, not become the subject,of bitter political controversy. The Labour Party will, in any case, be inclined to regard it as a further measure of de-nationalisation. But their temptation tomake party capital out of this issue would be greatly increased if the Bill includedprovision for the transfer of responsibility for weapon development to the Corpora-tion. This could only too easily be represented by the Opposition as a first step towards the private manufacture of atomic arms.Effects of Divided Responsibility6. However, it is from the standpoint of efficiency that this proposal is mostopen to objection.44654 b -1  1 ;     - Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1953        .
7. The Committee in effect recommend that the development of the atomicwarhead should be almost entirely divorced from the development of the weaponas a whole. Moreover, it would follow from their proposals that the responsibilityfor production would to a large extent become separated from the responsibilityfor development. This would cut right across the existing well-tried procedure for producing weapons, which has been progressively evolved as the result of dbhgexperience in war and peace. (See Annex.) For this there would he substituted make-shift organisation, which would seem calculated to bring about in the mostacute form all the evils of divided responsibility; With the best will in the world,the Committee&apos;s proposal would be well-nigh unworkable and would certainlyresult in much needless delay, friction and loss of efficiency!8. In paragraph 27 of their Report, the Waverley Committee propose that theService Department concerned should place an order with the Ministry of supply for a complete atomic weapon, but should also at the same time place a separateorder direct with the Corporation for the nuclear component of the weapon&apos;s war-head. They seem to envisage that the Ministry of Supply and the corporation would work more or less in water-tight compartments. In fact, they specificallyexpress the. view that the Ministry would not have to concern itself &quot; with theworking of the nuclear device nor with how the fissile material was used or how itwas detonated.&quot; The Ministry need only be told about the outside dimensions,weight and performance of the atomic component.9. It is evident from their Report that the Committee are aware of the practi-cal difficulties which would be created by the complete separation of duties whichthey propose. However, the only solution they offer to the problem of co-ordinationis that the Corporation and the Ministry of Supply &quot; should separately and jointlyconsider how the requirement would be met.&quot;10. In paragraph 51 of their Report, the Committee say: &quot; We do, however,concede that there will be a case for maintaining a supply directorate in the Ministryof Supply to undertake the overall progressing of research, development and pro-duction of all work in hand,&quot; both in the Corporation and in the Ministry. But theCommittee do not intend this progressing to be more than nominal, since they makeit clear, in their next paragraph, that the Ministry of Supply should not &quot; have any direct relation with A.W.R.E.,&quot; such as the Ministry normally has with industrialfirms who are carrying out development work on its behalf.11. The confused chain of responsibility, which tne adoption of the Com-mittee&apos;s proposals would produce, is well illustrated in paragraph 51. Here theReport states that &quot; it will no doubt be considered desirable to create a separateService Approval Authority in the Corporation.&quot; At the same time they envisagethat &quot; special arrangements&quot; would need to be made to enable the ApprovalAuthority &quot; to act in the closest liaison with the Ministry of Supply.&quot; Finally they provide that &quot; should any disagreement arise, appeal would be made to the service department concerned.&quot;12. All past experience has shown the advisability of placing responsibilityfor both development and production in the hands of the same authority. If therecommendations of the Waverley Committee were adopted, the Corporation wouid,it is true, be responsible for both development and production of the fissile core ofthe warhead. On the other hand, the high explosive which surrounds the core inside the warhead, though developed by the Corporation, would be manufactured by theMinistry of Supply. The Committee were unable to reach any conclusion as to where responsibility should be placed for the vitally important electric fifing circuitrequired to detonate the weapon; and they recommended that this and other equallycrucial issues should be left over for later consideration. The Corporation wouldbe responsible for evolving the procedure for assembling these various components,which together make up the atomic warhead; but when it comes:to assemblingactual weapons in production, it is not made at all clear whose task this would be.13. Under such a system, responsibility would be utterly blurred. If, forexample, it were found that a new atomic shell tended to explode in.the barrel ofthe gun, the Ministry of Supply might attribute the trouble to an. over-sensitivedetonating device in the atomic warhead developed by the Corporation, whereas the Corporation might very likely blame it on the excessive shock of discharge ofthe gun developed by the Ministry of Supply. ....
Need jor a Single Authority , ,; 14,  Such a situation would be quite intolerable- for, the Service Departments,,Who wilk insist onthere beingr a;single authority1 Whom they,can,hold, responsible :for providing complete weapons to meet the operational requirements they havespecified. This single authority must have full executive responsibility for planning .and progressing the development and procurement of the; complete weapons(including both their atomic and non-atomic elements), for qo-oxdinatiflg the design of the various components and. for ensuring; thatThe ^prdduetipn prqgrammes of thedifferent parts of the weapon are kept in phase with one&apos; another. ; ;:Since it is impossible to place upon the&apos;Corporation&apos; Responsibility forthe complete weapon (which may, for example, consist of a long-range radio-controlled rocket or a bomb with television guidance), this function will have tobe retained by the Ministry of Supply. .. -16. That would not necessarily be incompatible with the transfer of theAldermaston Establishment to the Corporation. But in that case the service departments would have to deal only with the Ministry of Supply. The latter would in its turn place contracts with the Corporation for the development of the nuclear components, in the same way as it regularly places development contracts with private firms. Whilst this arrangement would be administratively workable,it would necessitate the employment of an additional number of nuclear physicistsand other specialists to enable the Ministry of Supply to progress its contracts with the Corporation. This solution was, however, rejected by the WaverleyCommittee in paragraph 52 of their Report.17. Taking all the various factors into consideration, I have no doubt thatthe simplest and most satisfactory course would be to retain the Atomic WeaponsResearch Establishment as an integral part of the existing weapons organisationof the Ministry of Supply at any rate for the present. If, after a year or two,experience should show that it was desirable to transfer the Aldermaston Establish-ment to the Corporation this would present no difficulty. If, on the other hand, itwere now transferred to the Corporation and it were later found that a mistakehad been made, it would be most awkward to have to transfer it back again.Ministerial Responsibility for Corporation18.  The decision taken in regard to Aldermaston will affect the problem of allocating Ministerial responsibility for the Corporation.19. If the Corporation were given independent responsibility for weapondevelopment, and if Governmental control over the Corporation were to beexercised by the Lord President of the Council (or some other non-departmental minister) as recommended by the Waverley Committee, the same difficulties ofdivided responsibility would be reproduced at ministerial level. The Lord president would become responsible to the Service Departments for the nuclear componentsin atomic weapons, whilst the Minister of Supply would be responsible for theremainder.20. If, therefore, the Committee&apos;s proposals regarding atomic weaponresearch were adopted in their entirety, the only way of avoiding the overlapping of ministerial duties would be to make the Minister of Supply responsible for theCorporation, a course which I am certainly not advocating.21. If, on the other hand, the Aldermaston organisation is retained .by theMinistry of Supply, as I suggest, there would be no difficulty in placing responsi-bifity for the Corporation with the Lord President of the Council, though there might, in my opinion, be practical advantages in entrusting these duties to theMinister of Fuel and Power.Summary of Conclusions22. I have indicated above that, whilst the recommendations of the WaverleyCommittee would seem as a whole to be acceptable, there are serious objectionsto their proposals for the transfer of responsibility for atomic weapons researchto the Corporation, namely:  (a) If the Corporation is given responsibility for atomic weapons, the Goverh-ment will be obliged to exercise a far tighter control over the Corpora-tion than would be necessary if its activities were (apart from the;
ANNEXNormal Procedure for Development and Production of WeaponsThe normal and well-established procedure for dealing with the development and production of weapons of all kinds is broadly as follows:  (a) The Service Department concerned, with the technical advice and assistanceof the Ministry of Supply, formulates its operational requirement.(b) This requirement is examined by the Defence Research Policy Committee,which decides what Inter-Service priority should be accorded to it inthe overall development programme.(c) Treasury approval having been obtained, the Ministry of Supply thenarranges for the development of prototypes to be carried out either by government establishments or by outside firms. (The responsibilityfor developing the various components of a weapon may have to baentrusted to a number of different organisations.)(d) During the period of development, the Ministry of Supply continuouslyprogresses and co-ordinates the work of the establishments and firms concerned, and approves any necessary modifications. (modifications in one component often necessitate modifications in other components.)(e) After the prototype weapon has been developed and approved for Serviceuse, the Ministry of Supply places contracts for its production in quantity and progresses deliveries.production of fissile material) confined to the civil aspects of atomic&apos;&apos; energy and basic research.        ,(by The resistance of the Opposition to the creation of the Corporation wouldbe greatly increased by any proposal to relinquish direct Government5    control in relation to atomic weapons,(c) The complete separation of functions as between the Corporation and thevMinistry of Supply, in relation to atomic weapons, would result, in&quot;divided authority and confusion of responsibilities at both official and ministerial levels.Id) There would no longer be any single authority which the Service Depart-ments could hold responsible for the efficient development and pro-duction of complete atomic weapons.23. The only practicalway of avoiding these difficulties is for the Ministryof Supply to retain the same responsibility for the development of atomic weaponsas it has for weapons of other kinds. This could be achieved by one of twomethods:  (i) The Aldermaston Establishment could be transferred to the Corporation.The Ministry of Supply, whilst remaining responsible to the service departments for the complete weapons, would sub-contract to theCorporation the task of developing their nuclear components. (this solution would largely overcome difficulties (c) and (d), but would not meet objections (a) and (b).)(ii) Alternatively, the Aidermaston Establishment could remain, like otherweapon research establishments, within the organisation of the Ministryof Supply. (This is much the simplest solution and meets all theobjections set out above.)Recommendation24. I accordingly recommend that the proposals of the Waverley Committeeshould as a whole be accepted, subject to the retention by the Ministry of Supplyof the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. (The desirability of transferringthis establishment to the Corporation could, if necessary, be re-examined later inthe light of experience.)Ministry of Supply, W.C. 2,%5th August, 1953.
