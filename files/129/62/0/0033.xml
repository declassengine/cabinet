Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1953SECRET Copy No.C./.(53)-233 ,qt17th August, 1953 - :CABINET    rMONOPOLIES COMMISSION REPORT ONMATCHES AND MATCH MAKING MACHINERYMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeDiscussions with the British Match Corporation (B.M.C.), as authorised by theEconomic Policy Committee, have now taken place; and the B.M.G. have tentativelysounded their Swedish associates on the extent to which they would agree to revisetheir existing agreements. &apos;2.   The British Match Corporation have offered-(a) that prices charged for materials by companies controlled by B.M.C. shouldbe the same to all United Kingdom match manufacturers;(b) that B.M.C.&apos;s contribution to the payments to the Finnish firm Jokela, to restrain them from supplying machinery to B.M.C. competitors, should cease;(c) that the Swedish Match Company should be released from its undertakingnot to manufacture machinery, materials, or matches in the UnitedKingdom; - &apos;(d) that B.M.C. will register with the Board of Trade any new agreements andany changes in existing agreements.3. These offers would implement all the recommendations of the monopolies commission except price control; but they do not go to the root of the matter.The Swedes have also offered the ostensible change that they would waive any claim to compensation from B.M.C. for not selling enough Swedish matches in theBritish market; but they would expect a royalty payment for the extensivetechnical assistance which they at present provide without charge. The Swedes,however, are making two conditions: (i) they must have a denned and permanent share of the joint sales in theBritish market;and (ii) any new agreement must provide that, in the event of its being frustratedthrough nofault of the Swedes, they can (a) take control of John Masters &amp; Co., an English factory which the swedes used to own;(b) set up a rival selling agency in the United Kingdom;and (c) cancel the arrangements for sharing overseas,: markets.So far the discussions between B.M.C. and the Swedish Match Company have been quite informal. B.M.C. would be ready enough to grant the Swedes&apos; first condition(arguing only about the size of the Swedish share), but they want to resist the secondcondition.4. We have powers under the Monopolies Act to declare unlawful any agreement between the British Match Corporation and the Swedish Match Com-pany. In effect the Swedes have offered B.M.C. the choice between partnershipand competition; and we must shortly tell B.M.C. - which alternative the Govern-ment favours.  1 have no doubt that we should choose competition.5. I recognise that there are substantial arguments in favour of ouracquiescing in a continued partnership:-(a) It coincides with the advice of the Commission who refrained fromrecom-mending cancellation of the Agreements apparently because they thought that they were a good bargain from the British point of&apos;view.44688 &quot; &apos; M
(b) Abrogation of the agreements can certainly, bring;ino immediate or sub-stantial benefit to the British consumer&apos;of matches!(c) Breaking the overseas agreement will risk (through successful Swedishcompetition, e.g., in Canada) the loss of substantial British assetsV-Pi   invested in the match industry overseas, which yield an annual diyidehd;of about half a million sterling. , . -...... (d) While breach of the agreements will provide competition, it maylwell; snc$promote efficiency to a point at which the B.M.C. can, overhaul theSwedish technical lead which is based partly on skill and partly onavailability of raw materials.,-(e) The Swedes and other foreign manufacturers of matches have access toraw materials which are cheaper than in the United Kingdom; and theircompetition ;may seriously undermine an unprp:tepted,,British industry of/ some; ^strategic importance. &apos;. (    *     r(/) We may be driven to protect the United Kingdom iriddstry&apos; arid this might provoke retaliation against our exports to Sweden which has hitherto been a favourable market. &apos; &quot;: &apos;&apos;&apos;6. There is also the consideration that we may be represented as comingout against market sharing as such; and this in turn may have the effect of encouraging other Governments to attack cartels and inter-industry under-standings; and weaken our ability to preserve those that can be justified.7. These, as I have said, are substantial arguments; and, if we could settle the affairs of the match industry in isolation, they might tilt the balance in favourof partnership. But we;should not consider matches by themselves; any action we take on matches must be considered against the whole background of Britishindustry.8. The wider considerations which to my mind transcend all the particulararguments I have just mentioned are:  -(i) That the Monopolies Commission, though hesitant and at times almostcontradictory, said that &quot; the system as a whole operates, and is likelyto operate against the public interest&quot; (Paragraph 214); and this isthe sentence that will remain in the public mind after all the qualifica-tions have been forgotten.(ii) Many people believe that price fixing and market sharing agreements are sapping the vitality of British industry. I share this view, and^believe that a firm and public stand by Her Majesty&apos;s government at this moment against B.M.C.&apos;s practices would have a beneficial effecton a wide scale far outweighing any damage to the interests of thematch industry.(iii) The match industry is fairly small.   Even if it suffered damage as aresult of competition, it could scarcely be suggested that this would lead to any material change in our overall economic position, though,as pointed out in paragraphs 5 (e) and 5 (/), there could be awkwardconsequences in war if the industry were left unprotected.(iv) This will be treated as a test case.   If we do not take a firm line now and insist;on the Agreement being abrogated, we shall be openlycondoning a market sharing agreement which has been declared to be against the public interest; and we shall be encouraging other industries to do the same.9. In effect, then, if we acquiesce in continued partnership and reject theidea of inducing competition, all that we really have to offer to public scrutiny isthe old market sharing agreement shorn of its inessential trimmings, and mostimperfectly disguised.   &apos;.&apos; . &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos; ; -&quot;&quot;j:&apos;[ 10. Accordingly I ask my colleagues for authority to stand firm against thesuggestion that we should approve any agreement sharing the British marketbetween the British Match Corporation and the Swedish Match Company despite the risk of all the factors set out in paragraphs 5 and 6. If this authority is given,further discussions with the British Match Corporation will proceed on this basis.&quot;:.&apos;V:&apos;\       V&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;:&apos;:&apos;:&apos;-!;,Vr/^&apos;;    tV^Mff3P: &apos; ^-i&apos;&apos;--;^^:-::&apos;-&apos;::P.,T&apos;   &quot;Board of Trade, S.W.1,14th August, 1953.
