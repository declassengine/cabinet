(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KE-R BRITANNIC lvSAJSSTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.-G-(53) 239 CABINET21st AUGUST, 1953. _JAPAN AND THE GENERAL agreement on TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board pf Trade.When we last considered the question of Japan&apos;s accession to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) we decided that, at the forth&quot;coming Session of the Contracting Parties in September, our delegation should refrain from supporting Japan&apos;s accession or defining in advance our attitudetowards it, and should seek to have the issue deferred for a further period(C.C.(53) 47th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Since then the Japanese have asked for the question of &quot;provisionalassociation&quot; to be placed on the Agenda.   The gist of this application is to pointout that the Japanese are not responsible for the delay in arranging tariff negotiations in the G.A.T.T. so as to provide for their formal accession, and tosuggest accordingly that the Contracting Parties should agree to a temporaryassociation of Japan with the Contracting Parties.   They offer, in relation tothe temporary arrangement they seek, to bind a substantial number of theirtariffs and to accept the &quot;Article XXIII safeguard&quot; (a procedure which wouldenable any country, subject to the approval of the Contracting Parties, to adoptdiscriminatory measures against Japan if damage to domestic producers wasbeing caused or was apprehended).3, In my view, any form of Japanese association, however provisionalin its technical status, must almost inevitably set the pattern in practice for japan&apos;s later association on a permanent basis.   Certainly Lancashire would consider that acceptance by the United Kingdom of such an association wastantamount to acceptance of Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T. and of the mutualobligations that such acceptance must entail,4. The United States have indicated that they would almost certainly feelcompelled to support the Japanese request, and we may well find that a good many countries join the United States in feeling that this is a request which shouldbe granted.   In that event, I think that we should not go so far as to vote againstthe proposal for provisional association with the G.A.T.T., as an arrangement to apply between Japan and those Contracting Parties which are in favour of it,but we should at the same time state that we would not ourselves be parties to it.We could make it clear that this was entirely without prejudice to our attitude whenthe question of permanent accession came up later, and that meanwhile we expectedto be able in practice to continue most-favoured-nation tariff treatment.   We shouldnot be alone in abstaining.   We could certainly reckon on the support of Australia,New Zealand, South Africa, and, probably, France.5. I accordingly seek the agreement of my colleagues:(a) to abstain from voting when the question of Japan&apos;s provisionalassociation is raised, and to state that we could not ourselves beparties to it; and(b) to inform Commonwealth countries by telegraph of this decision and our reasons for it.,   , m    -n P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.21st August, 1953.
