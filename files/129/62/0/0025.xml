Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1953.SECRET Copy No.   7 6c. (53) 2257th August, 1953CABINETNEW HEBRIDESMemorandum by the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Secretaryof State for the colonies the Anglo-French Condominium in the New Hebrides has never workedsatisfactorily. In 1950 the Australian Government proposed that they should takeover United Kingdom responsibilities in the territory. This was accepted by theCabinet and it was suggested to the French Government that we should discuss this proposal with them. In June 1952 the Australian Government told us thatthey must defer any proposal to assume United Kingdom responsibilities in theterritory for at least two years. A note describing the territory and discussing someof the possible courses for dealing with the present unsatisfactory situation is at annex I. A copy of correspondence with Mr. Casey is at Annex II. On theinformation before us, and if the Australian Government are still not prepared toproceed with their 1950 proposal, we have concluded that of the various courses of action open to us (as set out in paragraph 14 of Annex I), the best will be toendeavour to reach agreement with the French Government on a revision of the1914 Protocol establishing the Condominium Government so as to permit of very necessary improvements in administration.2. But before a final decision can be taken the full financial and other impli-cations of this revision of the Protocol must be worked out, and we are satisfiedthat this cannot satisfactorily be done except by consultation between the Frenchand British authorities in the New Hebrides. We accordingly invite our colleagues to agree (1) that the French Government should be told of the reasons for Her Majesty&apos;governments dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs and invitedto agree that the British and French Resident Commissioners in theNew Hebrides should jointly examine, without commitment to either government, the revision of the Protocol, which at present seriouslyimpedes effective administration, and the reorganisation of the admini-stration where necessary in order to make the best use of availablefunds;(2) that we should inform the Australian Government forthwith that we are in course of approaching the French Government and should at the sametime take soundings in Australia to discover whether there is anylikelihood of the Australian Government being prepared to revert totheir 1950 proposals. (It will in any case be some time before our discussions with the French reach the point at which final decisions will be necessary);(3) that the New Zealand Government should be kept, informed.S.SWINTON.O.

ANNEX IThe New Hebrides Anglo-French Condominium MemorandumGeneralThe new Hebrides are a chain of about 80 islands, 550 miles long and 5,700square miles in area lying about 1,400 miles to the East of the coast of Queenslandin Australia. The main produce is copra which is at present exported to France.Cocoa, coffee and timber are produced on a small scale.2. According to latest estimates population consists of 340 British nationals(nearly all Australian), 1,208 French nationals, 45,000 natives (mainly Melanesian),1,853 Indo-Chinese coolies and 137 others.A d ministration3. In 1906 the British and French Governments established a Condominiumover the group by a Convention which, after operating unsatisfactorily for eight years, was replaced by the present Protocol in 1914. Under the terms of thisProtocol the group forms a region of joint influence, each power retainingsovereignty over its own nationals and financing its own administration, whilecertain joint services, e.g., public works and public health, are administered bythe Condominium Government and financed from local taxation. The group is divided into districts where French and British Agents operate jointly, while the condominium Services are staffed by French and British Officers on a basis agreedlocally. Should the Condominium be unable to raise the necessary revenue locallythe Metropolitan Governments are required to contribute jointly to balance the condominium budget and this was in fact done in the years 1932-36.4. The Condominium has worked unsatisfactorily ever since its inception.The reasons for this are the different policies pursued by the two Powers in theadministration of the area and the personal differences which are bound to arise in a system of administration where control is theoretically shared equally between two officers of different nationalities. The funds made available by the UnitedKingdom Government to the British Administration have been strictly limited; thishas not permitted the expansion of British interests, which in fact have wanedsteadily. (The Condominium does not qualify for assistance under the colonial development and Welfare Acts.)Previous attempted solutions5. The Imperial Conference of 1923 decided to open negotiations with theFrench Government with a view to partition, but in 1926 the French Governmentsharply rejected this proposal. In 1926 a Commission of Enquiry, consisting of anEnglishman, an Australian and a New Zealander, was appointed to report on thedeteriorating position of the British planters, many of whom were selling theirestates to the French. This enquiry produced no useful result.6. British withdrawal, subject to certain guarantees and, if possible, territorialor financial compensation, was approved by the Imperial Conference of 1930, butthe worsening financial position of the Condominium, which precluded any possi-bility of obtaining any compensation from the French Government, led the UnitedKingdom in 1932 to postpone any approach to the French Government first until1934 and then again until 1939.7. The question was reopened by the Australian Government at the ImperialConference in 1937 when they said that they were now prepared to take over theUnited Kingdom responsibility in the group. No action was taken at the timebecause a general European and Colonial settlement was then also under considera-tion, and the British share in the New Hebrides might have been a useful bargaining counter.8. During the last war the New Hebrides became an important base in operations against the Japanese, and the Australian Government proclaimed their special strategic interest in the group on several occasions.Post-War Developments9. Since the war the group has been financially prosperous owing to the high price of copra (although there was a sharp drop in 1952 followed by a partialrecovery) and the wealth brought to the Islands by Allied troops during the war.
44656Differences, however, between the British and French authorities and fhg crampingeffect of the 1914 protocol (see paragraph 10 below) have impeded progress withthe result that the Condominium Administration has become increasingly ineffective-tive in modern conditions. Neither the European npr native populations are associated in the Government of the group through representative institutions,nor is such association possible under the existing protocol. Very little has beendone to promote the social advancement of the &quot;native population. The british resident Commissioner is unable under the present system to exercise any effectivefinancial control over expenditure by the Condominium Administration.10. In 1947 the then Colonial Secretary directed that an attempt should bemade to revise the 1914 Protocol in order to remedy its more glaring deficiencies,in particular with regard to the status of the natives, the labour regulations andthe absence of any declared policy of political progress. The proposed revisionswere sent to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific for his commentsso that they could ultimately be discussed with the French. This was not pursuedafter the Australian proposal to take over United Kingdom responsibilities hadbeen received.11. In 1949 the French Government outlined proposals for an Anglo-Frenchdevelopment plan to be financed jointly by the two Powers. It is clear that ifthe British responsibility be retained some such plan will be necessary and thecost will probably exceed the reserve of the Condominium Government, whichat 31st December, 1952, was estimated to be  414,212. The biggest item at presentin view is the construction of a new permanent wharf at Santo to replace atemporary structure built by the Americans during the war which is now fallingdown. It is hoped to finance this with loan funds. Any development expenditure,however, which cannot be covered by loan funds or by the Condominium reservewill have to be found in equal shares by the French and United Kingdom Govern-ments. Any expenditure of this kind will be in addition to the basic cost ofmaintaining British services in the New Hebrides which is a direct charge on theUnited Kingdom Treasury (estimated net cost for 1953-54 approximately  58,000).Australian proposal to take over United Kingdom Responsibilities12. At the Colombo conference in January 1950 Mr- Spender, then AustralianMinister for external affairs, proposed that Australia should take over the british responsibility. The reasons given were the Australian strategic interest in thegroup and^the desire to put into effect a plan for the development of the land inthe New Hebrides (some 40,000 acres) owned by the Australian Government.The then Cabinet accepted the Australian Government^ proposal in principle.In August 1950 the French Government were informed of the Australian Govern-ment&apos;s proposal and early tripartite discussions were suggested. In April 1951 theFrench agreed to this, but said that they would like first to discuss with theAustralian Government the precise intentions of that Government. His lateMajesty&apos;s Government agreed to this, but since then the French Government hasmade no move in the matter. In June 1952 the Australian Government decidedthat&apos; their resources in experienced Administrative personnel could not keep pace with their requirements in Papua and New Guinea and that it was unlikely thatthey would be able within the next two or three years to release the necessary staff to take over the British administration in the New Hebrides. For this reasonthey must defer any proposal for assumption of United Kingdom responsibilities in the New Hebrides for at least two years. In these circumstances they realised that Her Majesty&apos;s Government might wish to proceed with discussions with theFrench Government for the revision pf the Protocol. (See Mr. Casey&apos;s letterreproduced in Annex. 11.) While the Australian Government may have been influenced by the facts given above, it is possible that they may have reached thisdecision largely because they think that that partition is the only possible solution in the New Hebrides and because they fear, as Mr. Casey&apos;s letter shows, that theFrench Government would agree to the transfer pf responsibility only on the basisof the existing Protocol. It seems possible, therefore, that the Australian Govern-ment will not re-open the matter. The reply sent to Mr. Casey is reproduced in annex II. The French Government were informed in a note dated October .11th,1952 from the Foreign Office to the French Ambassador that the Australian Gov-ernment had stated that they must defer any proposal that they should assume theresponsibility of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in the new hebrides for at least two years and that the French Government should therefore consider the Australian proposal withdrawn.
Future Policy13.   After Mr. Casey&apos;s letter had been received, the future of the new hebrides was further discussed with the High Commissioner for the western pacific.   At his request no action was taken until the matter could be discussed atthe Colonial Office with the Resident Commissioner when he came on leave.Unlike their predecessors, the present High Commissioner and Resident Commis-sioner believe that the Condominium can be made to operate satisfactorily if the protocol can be revised in certain essential respects and British officers can be foundto fill a reasonable proportion of the posts in the joint administration.   They are opposed to any attempt to persuade the French to agree to the partition of theterritory until this course has been tried.   It is hoped that by revising the Protocoland settling in discussion various aspects of the Condominium administration itmay be possible to make it more effective administratively and financially.   If this could be achieved it would be possible to embark on constructive policies designedto improve the lot of the New Hebrides natives, some of whom have as yetadvanced little from the primitive state in which they existed when the Con-dominium first started.   Education and medical services must be expanded and thestandard of living of the native must be raised, and plans for general economic development must be put in hand. It is also desirable that native courts and councils should be effectively established soon.   Until some progress has been made in thesematters the situation in the territory (on which a factual report is submitted annuallyto the United Nations under Article 73 (e) of the Charter) must continue to reflectmost unfavourably on the joint administering Powers.Possible Course of Action14.   The following are. some of the possible courses of action:  (D To accept the present position for a few more years in the hope that theAustralian Government will re-open the question of taking over Britishresponsibilities in the New Hebrides. The objections to this are thatthe territory would stagnate for a further period, and even if theAustralian Government re-opened the matter it is by no means certainthat the French Government would agree to the change. This coursewould, however, require the expenditure of less United Kingdom fundsthan any other course except handing over the whole group to theFrench. It would of course be a most acceptable development if theAustralian Government were prepared to take over United Kingdomresponsibilities. This seems unlikely, but we should make enquiries ofAustralia before we are finally committed to an alternative course.[See (2) below.](2) To terminate the Condominium and transfer the entire responsibility tothe French Government. Administration by a single Power, eventhough its method and policies are not those which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would choose, might possibly be better for the natives thanthe present system of three parallel administrations. This would beobjectionable,&apos; particularly to the Australian Government, on strategicgrounds; the British planters and missions would be left unprotected;there would probably be political criticism in this country and, above all, the transfer to a foreign country of a territory to which it has no claim would be likely to constitute a dangerous precedent.(3) To re-examine the possibility of the partition of the Group. It would bevery difficult to find a basis of partition acceptable to both parties.The French would claim the wealthier islands, which have been developed principally by French nationals and which contain the onlyharbours in the Group. A former Resident Commissioner has, how-ever, drawn up a plan for partition under which one harbour of strategic importance would be included in the British share of the Group bydividing the Island of Efate, on which the present capital stands andwhich has two excellent harbours one on either side of a range of hills.While partition would involve heavy initial expenditure it wouldenable the British Service to raise revenue in the territory which atpresent is prohibited by the Protocol. Administratively partition wouldbe by far the most attractive solution if it could be achieved. The HighCommissioner, however, is opposed to it because he thinks that it wouldbe more expensive to Her Majesty&apos;s Government than running the
Condominium, and because he thinks that certain practical difficulties would arise in connection with communications, smuggling between thetwo parts of the New Hebrides, and in providing technical staff and advice for a separate British administration. In his view it would notbe feasible to run the British part of the New Hebrides as a District ofthe British Solomon Islands Protectorate.(4) To attempt to secure the agreement of the French Government to a funda-mental revision of the Protocol. In view of the past history of negotiations with the French Government on this subject, there is no great hope that such negotiations would be successful. If, however,Her Majesty&apos;s Government decide that the course outlined in para-graph 14 (1) above is unacceptable, some effort must be made toimprove the present state of affairs, and an attempt to secure a revisionof the Protocol is as likely to be successful as any other. The french authorities show signs of wishing to speed up the development of theterritory and to improve social services, and they might, therefore, be favourably disposed towards an attempt to make the Condominiuma more effective instrument of government. The High Commissionerconsiders that he and the Resident Commissioner can probably securethe co-operation of their French opposite numbers with whom theyhave established cordial relations. An attempt to make the Condo-minium work would not prevent Her Majesty&apos;s Government at a later stage from trying to persuade the French to divide the territory inthe event of the Condominium proving unworkable after all. It might,however, lead to nugatory expenditure if in the course of trying tomake the Condominium work we have put United Kingdom funds intothe territory, and partition might present a much more difficultadministrative and financial problem if new schools, hospitals, &amp;c, havebeen built in places, which though suitable for the Condominiumadministration, would not be ideal under a partition scheme. It isnot possible to discover the full financial and administrative implications-tions of any course of action without having a joint investigation bythe British and French Resident Commissioners because the Condo-minium departments holding the necessary information are mainlystaffed by French officers. In order that the Cabinet may have fullerinformation before making a final decision it is thought desirable to seek the agreement of the French Government that the two ResidentCommissioners should jointly examine the Protocol and the administra-tive and financial organisation of the Condominium with a view to making it a more effective instrument of government; such an exami-nation would, of course, have to be entirely without commitment ofany kind to either Government.ANNEX IICommonwealth of Australia(Confidential)Minister for External Affairs,Melbourne.My dear Oliver,I write about the New Hebrides. ^In January, 1950, during the meeting of Commonwealth Foreign ministers at Colombo, my predecessor (Spender) indicated to P. J. Noel Baker (then Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations) that the Australian Government wouldbe interested in taking over the United Kingdom share in the Condominium ofthe New Hebrides. In this connection Spender suggested that the australian government be directly associated in any discussions with the French Governmentfor a revision of the protocol and that possible means might be explored by whichthe New Hebrides might be administered in a workable fashion, including thepossibility of partition by dividing the area along an agreed line.On 5th July, 1950, Gordon Walker (who had just -succeeded Noel Baker)advised that the United Kingdom Cabinet was in principle prepared to acceptSpender&apos;s proposals, and, on 23rd August, 1950, the French Government was so informed by the United Kingdom Government.
The French Government replied on 18th April, 1951, that it was preparedto give consideration to the proposal for the transfer to Australia of the UnitedKingdom Governments rights in the New Hebrides Condominium. The FrenchGovernment considered that, should such a transfer be made, it should be effectedon the basis of agreements at present in force. Before entering into discussions with the United Kingdom and Australian Governments regarding the&apos; form andconditions of transfer, the French Government proposed to approach theAustralian Government &quot; in order to ascertain the latter&apos;s attitude in regard to the subsequent development de jure and de facto of the regime of the Condominium.&quot;In view of the nature of the French Governments Note (which has in factnever been followed up by the contemplated approach to the Australian Govern-ment) we have been uncertain about the attitude that the French might be expectedto adopt in any discussions looking toward the transfer of United Kingdom rights in the New Hebrides, and in particular whether they would be prepared to contem-plate partition, the possibility of which we would have wished to have fully exploredin any such discussions. We have accordingly hesitated to pursue our earlierinitiative.Meanwhile, the need for additional administrative services in our existingAustralian territories has been growing, and we are feeling that our resources in experienced administrative personnel cannot keep pace with our requirements.It appears unlikely, in fact, that we shall be able within the next two or three years to release the necessary staff to take over the administration of British interests inthe New Hebrides.In the circumstances, therefore, we have come to the conclusion that we mustdefer any proposal for assumption of United Kingdom responsibilities in the new hebrides for at least two years. I realise, of course, that you may feel it desirable in these changed circumstances to proceed with your discussions with the FrenchGovernment for the revision of the protocol.As the initial approach to the French Government was made by the UnitedKingdom Government, I should be grateful if you could arrange for the ForeignOffice to explain the present position to the appropriate French authorities.I am,Yours sincerely,(Signed)        R. C. CASEY.Captain the Right HonourableOliver Lyttelton, D.S.O., M,CColonial Office,London, S.W. 1.30th July, 1952.Thank you for your letter of the 19th June about the New Hebrides. I note that your Government have decided that any proposals for the assumption by australia of United Kingdom responsibilities in the territory must be deferred for at least two years.  I will tell the Cabinet.We shall be sending you through official channels a copy of our communica-tions to the French Government telling them of your Government^ decision.(Signed)        O.
