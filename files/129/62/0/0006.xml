THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1953SECRET Copy No.    &quot;jf;C. (53) 20624th July, 1953CABINETOFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as agreed at Cabinet on 1st July, 1953 (CM. (53) 38th Conclusions, Minute 1),I have examined this question further with a view to meeting my colleagues&apos; wishesthat something should be done to meet the representations on behalf of retiredService Officers.2.   I mention three points by way of introduction:  (a) In my view we deceive ourselves if we think that the Service Officers willbe content with the Minister of Defence&apos;s proposal to restore Officers&apos;retired pay to the 1919 rates. Once we admit that awards made in thepast should be revised, there is no case in logic for recalculating pensionsat the 1919 or any other level short of current rates. That is what, theService and other pensioners want and what they will continue tocampaign for. We must be careful not to take a step which will makeinevitable successive advances to that most inflationary objective.(b) We cannot meet even the current suggestion of restoring the 1919 rates(or any variant of. that proposal) without making similar concessions tothe civil servants whose case for comparable treatment is incontro-vertible. The case for the Service Officers is that, whatever were the merits in 1935 of abandoning the 1919 system of adjusting pensions asthe cost of living rose or fell, those merits have long since disappearedwith the wide subsequent increases in living costs and the general adjust-ment in salary and pension rates. But the case of the civil servants isidentical. Their pensions after 1922 were cut for similar reasons andlike those of Service Officers were stabilised in 1935 on, though at a level based somewhat above, the cost of living at that time; at thelower levels this represented a cut of as much as 24 per cent, comparedwith the flat 9\ per cent, for Service Officers. They have precisely the same case in logic and equity for comparable treatment, and will undoubtedly press it home.(c) As under the Superannuation Acts civil service pensions are tied to the salary received at retirement, comparable treatment here will require legislation. It will therefore expose us to all the pressures that developduring the passage of legislation on this subject.3. Any scheme of revision is bound, for reasons which I will develop later inthis paper, to be dangerous. I have, however, had the possibilities examined and suggest that the scheme described in paragraph 5 below should be examined furtherby the Departments concerned. I reserve my final position.Existing Pensions Increase Measures4. The Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1944-47 and 1952, and the correspondingPrerogative Instruments, gave a gradua of increases, from 73 per cent, atthe bottom to zero at a pension of  550, on a &quot; hardship &quot; basis i.e., subject tolimits on total income, and at lower rates for single pensioners without dependants.This applied to Service Officers, civil servants, local government officers, teachers,44530
police, &amp;c. Side by side with this and for those for whom it was more favourablethe schemes of 1944-47 provided for &quot;automatic&quot; increases, independent of personal circumstances, for Service Officers and civil servants only. These were intended to give some compensation for the cuts imposed in the 1935 stabilisation;in fact they virtually eliminated the 9-1 per cent, cut for Service Officers on thelower levels of retired pay, but only represented a very partial restoration of the much larger cut borne by civil servants at the same levels. And in deference tothe general principle of all Pension Increase measures, compensation was limitedto those on the lower pensions, was on a reducing scale* as the pension reachedthe higher levels and ceased altogether when the pension reached  787 10s.Scheme to be Further Examined5. The best scheme which can be devised is as follows. We should amend the existing arrangements to provide that, without any means test, a minimumincrease of 10 per cent, should be given on all retired pay and pensions awardedup to 1945 f where this is more favourable than any increase already provided under existing Pensions Increase measures. Annexed is a table which shows the increases which such a scheme would ensure.6. My colleagues will see that under this scheme the maximum cash increases will be  109 for a Lt.-General and  127 for a General,  110 for a deputy secretary and  150 for a Permanent Secretary. Increases under the new measure will be very much smaller in the middle ranges and no increase at all will result inthe case of pensions of  400 or less, where equal or greater benefit is already given under existing legislation.7. The principle justifying this scheme can only be that it is unjust to main-tain even for higher level pensioners and whatever their private means-a reduc-tion in a contractual or quasi-contractual pension which, though justified at thetime by a fall in the cost of living, has been overtaken by a very large rise in thecost of living. I am bound to point out, however, that the basis on which we shouldbe building is extremely complicated. In particular I should mention that thepensions of the two senior grades in the Civil Service included in the above scheme(Permanent and Deputy Secretary) were not subject in form to the 1935 stabilisation-tion on which we must rely for the scheme&apos;s justification. This was because thecost-of-living bonus which they received up to 1921 had been abolished in that yearby the Geddes &quot; supercut.&quot; Thus, though they were not affected by the 1935stabilisation, they had earlier suffered a cut comparable to that which this imposed on Service Officers and other civil servants. I am in no doubt, therefore, that theymust be regarded as on all fours with all those whose pensions were stabilisedin 1935. There would certainly be the strongest and most justifiable agitationif, because of the peculiar accidents of now remote history, they received nothingwhilst senior Service Officers received anything up to  127.cost. I estimate very roughly that this scheme would cost  200,000 for the CivilService and a further  200,000 for Service Officers (including those in the Indianarmed services).9. We could not, however, confine the scheme to Service Officers and theCivil Service. Admittedly pensions for local government officials, police,teachers, &amp;c, were not commonly subject to a cost-of-living fluctuation, and in strict logic their exclusion from the scheme would be defensible. But they have always resented their exclusion from the &quot; automatic &quot; increases in the Pensions(Increase) Acts, which so far as &quot; hardship &quot; benefits are concerned apply to themprecisely as they apply to civil servants. In practice the pressure on this occasionwould be much stronger than in the past because the advantage of inclusion would,in the upper pension levels, be so much greater; and it would be ,quite impossibleto leave them out. However, as few apart from the most senior local governmentand police officers would benefit much, the cost of including these other public services would be comparatively small.* 10 per cent, on all pensions up to  400, 1\ per cent, between  400 and  600, 5 per cent between 600 and  750, reducing to zero at  787 10s.- f This date involves a great simplification of the facts. The intention is to cover pensions awardedduring the periods to which the 1944/7 schemes apply and before pensions awarded had begun to risein sympathy with pay.
The Dangers Inherent in this Scheme .10. I must warn my colleagues that, for the reasons given in my previous memorandum (CP. (53) 184), if we legislate on these lines we shall be open to very-considerable danger.,11. The main danger is that, once we admit that, without reference to hardshipin the hitherto accepted sense, contractual pensions can be recalculated in the lightof subsequent events, we have no sure stopping place short of giving all pensioners,whenever they retire, the benefit of. any increase given to those retiring under alater and improved code. There is no logic, no equity, in bringing pensions upto the level of the rates considered necessary in the context of the cost of living in 1919 or 1922 and we should not be doing even that for civil servants in themiddle ranges. The only logical context is that of 1953. Our proposal will thus be assailed as illogical and mean, and we shall be pressed to go much further.Why 10 per cent. why not 20 per cent.....?12. At the same time we shall be told that we are breaking the principles towhich all Governments, including the present, have adhered in their pensions increase measures that of giving increases according to hardship and of reducingthe percentage of benefit as the amount of the pension rises. The present schemequite blatantly gives benefit to those at the highest level,  127 for the General,but nothing more now for the Captain,  150 for the Permanent Secretary, nothing more now for the clerk. The tortuous exposition of what happened between thewars, the explanation that the less well off have already had their increases, will carry little conviction. The only concession that can be made to this criticism isto increase benefit at the lower pension levels as well a very dangerous and muchmore costly process.13. Further, though the 1947 Act provided for increases without a means testfor those who took the &quot; automatic &quot; increases, this would be the first pensions increase measure in which no test of means appeared at any point.14. Finally, though there is no logical case for linking any increase given to public service pensioners with a demand for improved war pensions, there is nodoubt whatever that if we introduce this scheme we shall be told that if we can afford to spend money on giving a 10 per cent, increase to a pensioner on  1,500a year irrespective of his private means, we can spare something for the warpensioner on 555. a week. This will open up the way to pressure to improve allthe other State pensions under the aegis of the (by then) Minister of Pensions and national Insurance. If we cannot resist this pressure we shall be involved in reallylarge expenditures. If we do resist it we shall do so at the cost of. widespreadresentment and ill-feeling.R. A.
