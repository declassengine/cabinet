24th JULY, 1953.CABINETTHE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.During the recess, preparation of most of the estimates for next year will begin.   It is desirable that my colleagues should have an assessment of thesituation as I see it, in the light of which to consider the demands to be madefor their Departments.2. The prospects of supply expenditure are fully reviewed in the Report ofthe Committee of Ministers on Supply Expenditure (C, (53) 166) which sets outthe large prospective increase in 1954/55 over   1953/54, particularly on defence and to a lesser extent on social services.COPY NO. o&quot;J r3. Some of the reviews connected with expenditure which are mentionedin that paper are already in hand.   The report by officials on the review ofdefence expenditure is now under consideration by Ministers.   The Committeeto enquire into the National Health Service and the Committee to examine theproblems of old age have been constituted.4. When these enquiries are complete we shall have the basis on whichpolicy and expenditure in these fields can be reviewed.   But we cannot expectspeedy results and we must find other means of easing the budget situation in1954/55.   If balance of payments considerations permit, we may be able to free from control further groups of foods, in which case the ending of thesubsidy on those foods would logically follow.   This matter is under considerationby the Economic Policy Committee.5. Besides this action on major services, it is imperative that there shouldbe all possible reductions over the field of expenditure generally.   I must ask my colleagues again to scrutinise their estimates personally and to make sure that they are reduced to the minimum.6, On housing the Minister has outlined the policy to be followed over thewhole range of housing, including the related questions of rent restriction and valuation.   His proposals will come forward for detailed consideration after the recess.   Meanwhile, there are definite indications that the load on the buildingindustry as a whole will reach a level which for a variety of practical reasons it willbe difficult to maintain, and it may well be necessary before long to considerwhether any special steps need to be taken to prevent the industry becomingoverloaded.7. The Budget prospects for next year are menacing.3. The general background against which I have to work is one of continuing anxiety about the fundamental soundness of our position.   It is trueSECRETC. (53) 211
that production has improved and is improving but it is as yet only slightly better than the low level of last year.   On the external side, our inability to expand our exports is disturbing.   This year we shall dolittle better than achieve a balance on external account, excludingUnited States aid which will certainly come to an end in the next year or so.   While the gold and dollar reserves continue to increase, helped by the receipt of United States aid, they are still inadequate:  andfurthermore the increase is offset by increases in our sterling liabilities.9. The very heavy demands made on our resources by public expenditure is of course a constant anxiety to those who are responsiblefor guiding the country^ economic fortunes.   On present forecasts weshall have to meet a heavy increase in expenditure next year.   Further,the income tax concessions made in this year&apos;s Budget will come into full effect.   Even if it is assumed that there will be some increase in the yield of existing taxes, the Budget position will be anxious.10. The conclusion of all this is that unless we are successful in making a determined effort to reduce public expenditure, I mayhold the position but it may prove impossible for me to maintain the move which I made in this year&apos;s Budget towards reducing the burdenof taxation.11. I must ask my colleagues to give instructions that theestimates for the services for which they are responsible for theforthcoming year are to be prepared on the basis of rigorous economy.It is clear that there can be no case for seeking approval next year for new services, or improvements in existing services, which have been deferred in previous years on grounds of economy.   The scrutiny of next year&apos;s expenditure will have to be more rigorous than that adopted a year ago.R.A.]Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,24th July, 1953.
