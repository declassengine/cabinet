(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C ON FIDE NT IA LC. (53) 207 copy NO,22nd JULY, 1953.CABINETOPENCAST COAL MININGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries in paragraph 4 of C. (53) 199 the Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power suggestthat it will be necessary to sacrifice some good agricultural land in order to achieve their objectives for opencast coal.2. While we do not wish, at this stage, to challenge the need to winsome coal by opencast methods, we must urge that even in our present coalshortage good quality agricultural land is not used for this purpose.  As soonas deep-mined output improves we hope that opencast working will be abandoned.3. The Cabinet has already agreed about a year ago (C.C.(52) 56thConclusions, Minute 4) that certain land in East Lothian, part of it class Iland and the rest class II land (under the classification adopted for the landutilisation survey of Great Britain) should not be worked for opencast coal.Subsequently it was agreed between the Minister of Fuel and Power and theSecretary of State for Scotland that various other sites in East Lothian,some of them on class I land and some of them on class II, should not be workedfor opencast coal-4, Recently our colleagues have been pressing for the acceptance ofopencast working on a number of sites in an area of some 4,000 acres of class I land in the Ormskirk district of Lancashire.5. The gross annual output from the Ormskirk land is about  66 per acre, more than double the national average.   The bulk of the land is comprised in the Derby and Sefton Estates and its present high level of fertility has been built up by successive generations, often of the same families, with the help of the dung from Liverpool and Manchester cowsheds and stables.6, Opencast work must inevitably damage seriously this high level offertility, and in the sandy peat soil which prevails over much of the Ormskirkarea the satisfactory restoration of the intricate system of land drains andditches will be impracticable.7. Proposals have also been made for prospecting over elevensites estimated to cover 2,400 acres in East Fife.   Much of this landis of fully as good quality as that which was exempt from working in east Lothian by the Cabinet&apos;s decision last year.   These proposals are atpresent under discussion between the Minister of Fuel and Power and theSecretary of State.
8. Both in Lancashire and in Fife there are other areas of land,much inferior agriculturally, on which the possibility of opencast workingmight if necessary be explored.9. Public opinion is becoming increasingly critical of opencast working,and agricultural interests in particular regard the taking of good land forthis purpose as entirely inconsistent with our campaign for a substantial increase in agricultural production.T.3.T.L.D.22nd July, 1953.
