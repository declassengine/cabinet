I I^-M      m     THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1953 -^^HThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issuedfor the personal use of .......I    TOP SECRET &apos;J&apos; Copy No. jQ^fl 229/d| August, 1953 ^L^LACABINETFIVE-POWER STAFF AGENCY FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIAMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceI There has recently been established a Five-Power Staff Agency for South-East^k^k Asia whose purpose is to concert purely military plans in the context of aggression Iby China. The participants in this Agency are the United Kingdom, the United I^k^k States, France, Australia and New Zealand.  Planning is consultative only andwithout commitment to Governments.H H 2.   The June meeting of the Agency Planners, was of considerable value and I^-^k achieved more than had been hoped for or expected.  Studies on a number of Isubjects reached an advanced stage of planning, and recommendations were made Hto allow implementation of the plans should the suppositional forces be made3.  Planning has throughout been on a purely military basis and remains so^-^k and the Planners have specifically excluded consideration of the risk of anyparticular action bringing in Russia, which they regard-and I agree-to be amatter for political assessment outside their terms of reference.^-^k 4.  The discussions already initiated include the defence of Hong Kong, andit has now been recommended that further detailed discussions should be heldbetween the Commander, British Forces, Hong Kong, and the American Com-I mander designated to control any American reinforcements which might beprovided. Such discussions would be in accordance with the policy agreed by theDefence Committee which also agreed that the outcome of such discussions couldbe made known to the Australian and New Zealand Chiefs of Staff.5. The Chiefs of Staff propose that the Commander, British Forces, Hong IKong, should be instructed to reiterate in these detailed discussions the United HKingdom&apos;s intention of defending the Colony with the forces available there at the Itime, and to reveal the present forces irt the Colony and those disposed elsewhere Iin the Far East Theatre. He would, however, emphasise that any action that might Hbe taken to reinforce the Colony would naturally have to be decided in the light of Hthe prevailing circumstances.6. It is an accepted policy of the Agency that the outcome of any bilateralW^-W           discussions between members of the Agency affecting matters within the area ofI planning responsibility of the Agency should be made known to all members. This IH I        would necessitate revealing the outcome of these Anglo-American discussions notW^-m only to Australia and New Zealand but also to the French.7. I strongly support the view of the Chiefs of Staff that, if we adopt the lineI         in paragraph 5, authority should be given for telling the Agency as a whole theoutcome of these discussions. Should We refuse to agree to such disclosure it would44670
H &apos;^Hf |f 2 ? Iundoubtedly have a damping and damaging effect on the excellent work being doneby the Agency and hamper its development into machinery for real strategicco-ordination in South-East Asia. ^^mi8. In September a further planning meeting is being held, at which the defenceof Malaya is to be discussed. The Chiefs of Staff see no necessity for any discussionof specific British plans for this area. They have therefore given instructions that at^-^m no mention be made to the French and Americans of current British plans. TheDefence Committee have already agreed to Australia and New Zealand being toldof these plans.9. The Chiefs of Staff therefore wish to allow the United Kingdom repre-sentatives to take part in planning discussions on the defence of Malaya in thecontext of major Chinese aggression and in the circumstances envisaged by theAgency. Such planning would be on the basis of suppositional British forces andwould in no way be tied to present force availabilities. I agree with this proposalW^M of the Chiefs of Staff.10. I invite the Cabinet to agree to the proposed course of action I have out-^^mi lined in this paper and to authorise instructions being given to the Chiefs of Staff ^mw\to proceed accordingly.mmm mmmMinistry of Defence, S.W.I, ^L^LX11th August, 1953.
