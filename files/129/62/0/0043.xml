CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    -C. (53) 24328th August, 1953CABINETERECTION OF A MEMORIAL AT DUNKIRKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for war at their meeting on 1.1th February, 1952, the Cabinet were invited to consider what sort of memorial should be erected at Dunkirk by the Imperial War graves commission. After discussion, the Cabinet deferred their decision and invited the Secretary of State for War to bring the matter before them again in the summer of 1953 (C.C. (52) 15th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. Because of the historical importance of the Dunkirk operation the Corn-mission felt that the Government should have the opportunity of deciding whether there should be erected:  (a) a memorial in a garden setting alongside the plots of graves of the 1914-18and 1939-45 wars in the Dunkirk Town Cemetery which would takethe form of a cloister building and would carry the names of some4,600 of the Army who have no known place of burial. Such a memorial would be the Commission^ responsibility and they have sufficient funds available to meet the estimated cost of  23,000;(b) a larger memorial not only commemorating by name the men referred toabove but also commensurate with and commemorating the Dunkirkoperation; an architectural design for such a memorial has beenprepared comprising a cloistered garden on the sea front overlookingthe beaches with a look-out tower rising from the garden clearly visibleto all shipping passing along the coast and providing opportunities forvisitors to view the beaches or to rest and meditate in the shelter of thecloistered walls. This project is estimated to cost about  100,000.The Imperial War Graves Commission would be able to contribute 23,000 and the balance would have to be provided by an exchequer grant.3. I now invite the Cabinet to decide whether the Commission should proceedwith the more modest proposal or whether funds should be provided for the largerproject.A.H.War Office, S.W.1.26th August, 1953.Printed for the Cabinet.
