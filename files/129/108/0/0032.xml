FARM PRICE REVIEW, 1962jUjgmorandum by the Minister o  AgricultureFisheries and food on 6th February, the Cabinet agreed that our aim in the farm price Review should be to withdraw last year&apos;s increase of 0. 8d, per gallon in the guaranteed price for milk and to secure savings of 8 million on other commodities (C. C. (62) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6)0After allowing for some automatic or minor changes, these cuts would reduce the value of the guarantees by about  14 million - the maximum amount permissible this year under the Agriculture Act, 1957.2.      In accordance with these decisions, officials have put to the farmers&apos; Unions the Price Schedule which is set out in the Annex.This Schedule concentrates the price cuts on milk, sheep and eggs wherethere is the strongest case for cutting back.    For cattle and sheep,we are also introducing more stringent standards of eligibility designedto strengthen the market price.3.      The Unions have replied with a Price Schedule which v/ouldincrease the value of the guarantees by  2. 7 million.     This of course is tactics.    My guess would be that they would agree the R.eview at adecrease of between  4 million and  9 million.     Their main generalarguments are:-(i)   A Review of minus  6 million v/ould hold their incomesteady;  a Review of minus  14 million would Berepresented as a cut in their income, next yearcompared with this year, of   8 million.(ii)    They would be prepared to accept a &quot;pay pause&quot; not a&quot;pay cut&quot; for an industry whose income since thewar has already fallen well behind the nationaltrend.(iii)    In the White Paper on the Unions&apos; talks with theAgricultural Departments in I960 (Grand. 1249)the Government gave an assurance that &quot;they intend, taking one year with another, to leavefarmers with a share of the gain from increasing efficiency&quot;.    A Review of minus  6 million takes the whole of their gain from greater efficiency;   atotal cut of  14 million v/ould take all of this andmore.C (62) 32 COPY NO.  C0^2nd March, 1962CABINET
4.     An award on the lines of the Schedule has the drawback that the cuts tend to fall on the smaller farmers.     If we were to decide to takeless than the maximum cut of  14 million, my inclination would be toextend the scope of the Small Farmer Scheme and/or to take somewhat less off the milk price.5.      The maximum cut on the basis of which I  would see any possibility of getting the Unions to agree to the Review would be, say, 8 million.    If this were to be done I would extend the Small FarmerScheme at a cost of about  2. 5 million and reduce the price of milk by0. 4d. instead of 0. 8d0    In this way we would be reducing the estimate of exchequer commitment (including doing away with the Exchequer subsidy on milk) by at least  14 million at this Review as opposed to about 16 million under the full cut,6.      I would be glad of my colleagues&apos; decision on:-(i)     Whether we should insist on the full cut of 14 million in this year!s Review.(ii)      Whether I should try to reach agreementwith the Farmers&apos; Unions on a cut of around   8 million.C.S.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.
