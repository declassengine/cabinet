THE EFFECT ON HOUSEHOLDERS OFI^YALJ^TjONjFoR RATES IN 196;memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Ti-easuryand Paymaster-general  hope the Minister of Housing and Local Government willforgive me if I refer to the paper C. (62) 45 circulated by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and the extract quoted therein from a speech of mine at Rhyl when I was taking the Rating and Valuation Bill of 1961through Parliament.20      Earlier in that speech I had made clear that what the Govern-ment would not allow was an increase of 33-f per cent or more in the share of the total rate burden falling on householders nationally.The reference was to the national figure, not to the figure in anyparticular town or county.     But the Chancellor of the Duchy is perfectlyright in thinking that neither there nor on any other occasion did I say anything to imply that a de-rating oz*der would not be made unlessthe householders&apos; share rose by 33-1&quot; per cent nationally.   My object was to retain complete freedom of manoeuvre.3.      I must state however that everything said during the passageof the Bill about the power to vary the percentage of de-rating asbatwesti one county or county borough and another was linked to theassumption that there would have to be a national de-rating order.The present situation - that a national order will not be needed, the values of commercial and industrial and other non-residential propertyhaving risen far more than anyone had thought possible - would ayear ago have seemed too wonderful a political godsend to be true.4.      The tapering action proposed by the Chancellor of the Duchywould, I believe, require legislation.   The view was taken, when theBill was going through, that unpopularity would be sharper but muchmore short-lived if a man&apos;s rates went up by (say) 20 per cent all atonce than if he learnt that they were to go up 5 per cent next year,5 per cent the year after, and so on.   It would be rather like having a finger amputated by degrees, a joint a year.5.      During the passage of the Bill I therefore explained to thelibuse that, if a de-rating order was made, it would remain in force feueoughout the five years up to the next revaluation (1968) and wouldthen lapse, unless before then fresh legislation had been enacted.-1-SECRETGj,6^1i6 COPY NO.5th March, 1962CABINET
6.      My personal view is that the disadvantages in making anorder to shift part of the rate burden for five years from the house-holders of Bournemouth, Blackpool, etc , on to the hotels, boardinghouses, shops and industries of those towns will be found to outweigh the advantages.Ho B.Treasury Chambers, S, W. 1.5th March, 1962
