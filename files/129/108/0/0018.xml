UNITED NATIONS BOND ISSUEMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs on 23rd January the Cabinet invited me to circulate a furtherpaper setting out the conditions which might be attached to an agreement by her Majesty&apos;s Government to subscribe twelve million dollars to the united nations Bond issue (C.C.(62) 7th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. I do not think it would be practicable to make our participationcontingent upon the imposition of penalties on defaulting members, since this would require amendment of the United Nations Charter;  nor would itbe appropriate to make it conditional on a satisfactory degree of supportbeing forthcoming from the United States Government on Colonial questions,since one of the arguments for our subscribing to the Bond issue is that out failure to do so would be damaging to Anglo-American relations.   The onlyconditions we can properly attach to our undertaking to sbuscribe to the Bondissue are financial ones related to the United Nations&apos; need for cash andthe extent to which other members fulfil their financial obligations to it.3. The form of words that I recommend is as follows:-&quot;As it is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to supportthe United Nations Organisation and to do what they can to ensure its efficiency and solvency, they intend to respond to the Secretary-GsneraFsappeal for subscriptions to the United Nations Bond issue by buying bondsup to a total value of twelve million dollars.   These will be taken up beforethe end of 1963.   In making our contribution we shall take into account the cash requirements of the Organisation and the extent to which other countriescontribute.   We regard the issue of bonds as a once-for-all measure designedto give the United Nations an opportunity to put its finances in order;  andwe look to the Organisation to take the opportunity which the Bond issueoffers of putting its finances in order. &quot;4. I suggest that a statement in this form should be made toParliament as soon as possible.   I also suggest, in view of a report received in New York that President Kennedy may be about to address a personal message to the Prime Minister on the subject of the Bond issue, that. M. Ambassador in &quot;Washington be instructed to inform the United StatesGovernment in confidence meanwhile.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.24th .January, 1962C (62) 18 COPY NO. to24th January, 1962CABINET
