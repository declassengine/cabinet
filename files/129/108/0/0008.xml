C. (62) 812th January, 1962CABINETUNIVERSITY salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee at their meeting on 10th January were unableto reach agreement on this matter and decided that it should be referred to theCabinet.2. The existing University salary scales have been effective from 1st January, 1960. The University Grants Committee, who are the Governmenfsofficial advisers in this field, had it under consideration to put in freshrecommendations to us a year ago, but with my approval it was suggested to theirChairman, Sir Keith Murray, that they should postpone doing so until it had become clearer what sort of increases were likely to be made in teachers&apos; salariesas a result of Burnham negotiations. The Chairman persuaded his Committeeaccordingly, and I feel a certain responsibility for the fact that the university grants Committee&apos;s eventual recommendations did not reach me until July 1961,a few days before the beginning of the pay pause.3. The recommendations of the University Grants Committee, when theyarrived, were for increases that would cost an additional  5-05 million in a full year, i.e., a 17 per cent, increase on the current salary bill. All University grades(except Clinical Professors) would receive increases, the number involved beingabout 12,000. The recommendation was that increases should take effect from 1st August, 1961.4. Recommendations for still larger increases had been made, to theUniversity Grants Committee by the Committee of Vice Chancellors and by theAssociation of University Teachers. All three bodies were informed that-the pay pause precluded any increase at the present time, but that meanwhile theclaim would be examined on its merits.5. In October 1961 the Chief Secretary, Treasury, took over the examinationof the University Grants Committee&apos;s recommendations, which were based on two main grounds:(i) Deterioration of relativities between University staff, on the one hand, and civil Service Administrative and Scientific grades and the teaching staffin the Colleges of Advanced Technology on the other hand.(ii) The need to attract (and retain) good Honours Graduates in order to implement the Governmenfs policy of rapid University expansion.6. It is not accepted by the Treasury that there is any comparability betweenthe work of Administrative Civil Servants and that of University staffs, or anyground for particular pay relationship between them. As to the Colleges of advanced Technology they have a quite different pay history and a different pay structure, with more money in the lower grades and less at the top; they havehitherto come under the Burnham procedure, which has just given them a 174- percent, increase effective from 1st January, 1962.Copy No.5 560264THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

7. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, did not consider that the University GrantsCommittee proposal of a 17 per cent, increase for University staff was justified,but came to the conclusion that an increase of some 8 per cent, (costing  2-4 million) was justifiable having regard to the proposals for University expansion(a 30 per cent, increase in students over the next five years) and to the salaryrises which have taken place from 1st January through the rest of the teaching profession. He recommended that, as the rise was primarily for recruitment^-purposes, it need not start from a date earlier than the beginning of the nextacademic year (1st August, 1962). Whatever was proposed would, however, haveneed to be announced in January or February, 1962, as that was the period of year when recruitment for the next academic year started.8. He had meanwhile informally sounded the Chairman of the university grants Committee who said that, if the Government ruled that no more than acertain amount of money was available this year, the University Grants Committeewould have to accept that; but that they must make clear that in their considered opinion anything falling substantially short of their recommendation would fail to meet the need to attract and retain staff of sufficient quality and quantity, andthat it would have to be publicly announced that the Governments decision wasnot in accord with the Committee&apos;s advice. The least that would suffice in theCommittee&apos;s view, and that only as an interim expedient, would be a sum of 2f- 3 million, i.e., a 91 per cent, to 10 per cent, increase, concentrated entirely on improving the scales of the recruitment grades (Assistant Lecturer and Lecturer)and giving the higher grades nothing for the moment.9. The Chief Secretary told the Chairman that he did not think that such anarrangement, concentrating the whole available increase on the two lowest grades,would have any durability. The most that seemed to him reasonable would be,if 9 per cent. ( 2 - 68 million) were available, to concentrate the whole of the extra1 per cent, on the recruitment grades.1.0. The Economic Policy Committee considered the issues. The majoritytook the view that the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal of an increase amounting to per cent, or 9 per cent, on the current salary bill, distributed so as to benefit tosome extent all the main grades, but with proportionately larger increases forAssistant Lecturers and Lecturers, would imperil the Governments endeavour tosecure restraint, in the intermediate stage after the pay pause. If the Government,in the case of the Universities where the matter was entirely under the governments own control, announced an 8 per cent, increase, that would wreck any chanceof securing a settlement for the railwaymen or the miners or other classes ofindustrial workers with substantial claims, at anything like a figure of 2\ per cent.The Government would seem to be refusing to take the medicine which theyprescribed for others. The Minister of Health, in particular, felt that a settlement for the Universities at 8 per cent, would leave him with no chance of securing asettlement at around 3 per cent., of a very large claim that had come in from nursesunder the National Heath Service. The majority of the Committee consideredthat 3 per cent, for the University staffs from 1st August, 1962, was the most thatthe Government could give, with or without an indication that a further 3 percent, might be granted in 1963 and another 3 per cent, in 1964, making 9 per cent,in all over three years.11. A minority of the Committee took the view that public opinion would recognise an obvious distinction between the problem of University staffs and theproblem of railwaymen, miners and others. By August 1962 the University staffswould have received no increase for more than 2\ years, whereas all the rest of the teaching profession (including the Colleges of Advanced Technology which recruitfrom just the same field as the Universities) have had large increases as from 1st January; the teachers and the staffs of the Colleges of Advanced Technology,who had been on their previous scales for 2\ years, have received 14 per cent, and\1\ per cent, respectively. It did not seem possible to present an increase of only per cent, for the remainder of the teaching profession the University staffs-asa policy that made any sense at all; and a Government decision of that characterseemed likely to cut right across the Governments previous policy of rapidUniversity expansion.12. The Economic Policy Committee invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to see the Chairman of the University Grants Committee and to ask him privatelywhat view he thought his Committee would take of a decision that the Government
could not make available more than 3 per cent, this year, and what likelyconsequences this could set in train. The Chief Secretary has done this. Sir KeithMurray, who is not without understanding of the Governmenfs difficulties, saidthat in his judgment the University Grants Committee would say that the figure was quite unacceptable (they have already intimated that nothing far short of their original recommendation would in their view meet the need) and that they wouldprobably instruct him to tell the Treasury that such a decision would seriouslyimperil &quot;the University expansion programme. The University Grants Committeewould need to withdraw as unreal their proposals and estimates for the forthcomingQuinquennium which they have just presented to the Treasury, and would have togo back to the Vice Chancellors to consult them about a revised plan for the quinquennium, based on the lower number of staff available which would result from the Governmenfs decision. Before that point, he thought it would be essential for the Government to announce their decision publicly, because all the proposalsfor the Quinquennium could not be revised in detail on a new basis without a good many people getting to know about it.13. The Chief Secretary asked Sir Keith Murray whether his Committee wouldreally think that an increase of 3 per cent, operating on the academic year 1962-63,whatever it might be possible to decide in 1963 and onwards, would seriously hinderrecruitment. He replied that it would and that whatever might happen in future years, such grave damage would have been done to the relations between the universities and the Government that confidence in the Governmenfs attitudetowards University expansion would take long to restore.14. The Government are, in my view, on the horns of a dilemma. We cannotignore the risk that a 3 per cent, decision will imperil the University expansion programme, and will alienate from the Government a great deal of thinking opinion,both in the Universities and elsewhere. It will seem completely inconsistent with what we have done for teachers and the staff of the Colleges of advanced technology. On the other hand we cannot ignore the risk that a decision by theGovernment to provide an additional 8 per cent, or 9 per cent, on the Universitysalary &quot;bill will undermine our whole policy of securing wage restraint in the coming year. A decision is urgent, because the University Grants Committee at their meeting on 17th January are expecting to know the Governmenfs views on their recommendations submitted six months ago.S.
