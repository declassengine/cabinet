SECRETPrinted $or the Cabinet.   February 1962C. (62) 28 Copy No.    5013th February, 1962CABINETDECISIONS ON SAVINGS-Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster GeneralThis subject has been before the Cabinet for over two months, and the time has come for decisions.The Vote on Account has to be published on Tuesday, 27th February, and either on that day or before a statement on public expenditure will have to bemade to Parliament.Estimates, 1962-632. After stringent Treasury scrutiny, the Estimates are  111 million abovethe level set by the Chancellor^ &quot; 2\ per cent, pledge &quot; of 25th July.3. This is much more than can be explained away. There are three offsetswithin our power:(i) Abolish welfare milk subsidy except for families with four or more children or three under-fives (saving  15 million in 1962-63,  20^million in a full year).(ii) Raise price of school meals by 6d. (saving  17 million a year).(iii) Agriculture, in accordance with C.C. (62) .11th Conclusions, Minute 6(saving  16 million a year).4. We cannot announce (iii) until March when the Farm Price Review is completed, but we must decide (i) and (ii) now because they affect the Vote onAccount. I am also raising with the Ministers concerned some minor but usefulsavings not effective at once for these Estimates, e.g., termination of dedicationgrants to private woodland owners.5. Even if we take credit for a full year&apos;s savings, the total will still be some 55-60 million over the pledge figure: on the cash basis for the year, more like 70 million over. This is too much. To reassure critical opinion at home andabroad we must show that we are also taking firm decisions to contain the longer-term growth of public expenditure. This primarily means public investment:the decisions for 1963-64 investment expenditure, subject as always to final review in July, are already several months overdue.Public Investment, 1963-646. To limit the growth of public service investment expenditure in 1963-64 to6 per cent, above 1962-63 (which itself will be 6 per cent, above 1961-62), I have proposed: .HousingApprovals of 105,000 instead of 110,000 in 1963 (compared with 100,000 in1962, and the 120,000 that the Minister would like thereafter). Reduction of 12Jf million on investment programme.60400
Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,12th February, 1962.EducationSpread over of starts envisaged for 1962-63 and 1963-64 over (say)28 months instead of 24. Reduction of  15 million on investment programme in 1963-64. The Minister is unwilling to reduce by more than  5 million.HealthReduction of Ministry&apos;s 1963-64 investment expenditure on hospitals andlocal health and welfare services by  5^ million (the same proportionatereduction as is asked from Ministry of Education). (The Minister of Healthhas accepted these reductions, on the understanding that other Ministers are willing to do their share.)Scottish DepartmentsReduction of  2 million in 1963-64.Home Office and other DepartmentsReduction of 3 per cent, in 1963-64. Saving of  2-J million. (The HomeSecretary has accepted these reductions on the understanding that other ministers are willing to do their share.)These are difficult decisions, for they take our various expansion plans a little slower than had been hoped. I should add that the Minister of Housing has agreed to a 10 million cut for Water and Sewerage, and also that a five-year Road programme was announced some months ago which represents less than half the expansion thatthe Minister of Transport wanted.7. For nationalised industries, we must obviously meet the essential requirements for power, transport and communications in order to developeconomic growth, but my proposals include a marginal cut in electricity, an increasein the self-financing of the Post Office, and continued withholding of approval forstarting the Victoria Tube.8. In public investment as a whole (public service and nationalised industries)the total in 1963-64 would still, on these proposals, be over  100 million higher thanin 1962-63.9. If we do not make these reductions, we shall then be running just thesame jisks as have proved so frustrating to our hopes time after time in the last10 years. We have been here before; but this time there are two new circumstances:(i) The specific &quot; pledge &quot;. We are far from carrying this out, but acceptanceof the proposals in this paper could fairly be regarded as an earnest of determination to put our affairs in order. In all this we have toconsider what effects our action or inaction will have on overseasconfidence in us.(ii) In our endorsement of the Plowden Report and specifically in The Queen&apos;sSpeech we have accepted the policy of keeping public expenditure within limits justified by the national resources. If these proposals are not accepted, we shall have nothing to say in public, except to admit anunbalanced position which we are failing to remedy.10.  The questions for decision appear to me to be:(i) Whether we should adopt the proposals in paragraph 3 for welfare milk and school meals, and such minor savings as are under discussion.(ii) Whether we should accept the proposals for controlling the rise in public investment in 1963-64.H.
