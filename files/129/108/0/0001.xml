We were much assisted in our discussions bySir William Penney, Deputy Chairman of the United Kingdom atomic energy Authority, and Dr. Seaborg, Chairman of the United States atomic energy Commission,2.  ^Assessment of the recent series of Soviet testsSir William Penney and Dr0 Seaborg explained that the recentseries of Soviet tests had undoubtedly been of military significance.The Soviet Union has not drawn ahead of the West in nuclear knowledgebut the lead which the West previously possessed has disappeared.   TheRussians may now know more than the West about 100 megaton weapons andtheir effects, although the West are still better informed about light-weight weapons  with an explosive power of about one megaton.   If bothsides now refrained from conducting further tests the balance of the deterrent could be held.   The indications are, however, that some of theSoviet tests were directed towards the development of anti-missile systems.If therefore the Russians, after a further period of preparation, whichmight take as long as two years, were to conduct a further series of testsand the West had meanwhile refrained from further testing, the soviet union might then be at a significant advantage in the anti-missile field.3.   Possibilities of an anti-missile defenceBoth the British and the American scientists agree that thedifficulties of developing an effective anti-missile defence are enormous.To be really effective such a system.would have to be able to destroyover 90 per cent of any attacking missiles.   This would be extremelydifficult in any case, but the task of the defenders could be made evenharder if attacking missiles had decoys in them.   In addition it is possiblethat very large explosions at high altitudes might further complicate the defence by interrupting radar and radio systems.   Finally, suchweapons, exploded perhaps as far as 25 miles from the earth, would bemuch harder to destroy by anti-missile attack than would weapons set to-1-
explode at lower altitudes.   But nuclear weapons in the 80-100 megatonrange could cause great destruction by their heat and fire-raising effectseven though they were exploded at these high altitudes.   Our experts,therefore, concluded that the chances of effective anti-missile defencewere extremely remote.    Nevertheless, the stakes were so high andthe resources available to the Soviet Union and to the United states were so great that it was impossible entirely to discount the possibility that such a defensive system might eventually be developed.   Moreover,if one side or the other made significant progress in this field, even ifit fell short of a completely effective system, or if they could plausiblyclaim to have done so, the balance of the deterrent might be decisivelyupset.   Consequently, in the absence of an adequately controlled banon nuclear tests, neither the West nor the Soviet Union could afford to renounce the effort necessary to try to make progress in this field.4*   Value of Christmas IslandThere are various places in which further nuclear testscould be conducted but there are objections to all of them.   Nevada is toonear populated areas, Johnston Island is very small and Eniwetok, aswell as being a trust territory, would take longer to re-activate thanChristmas Island,   Tests could be conducted from ships at sea, but these would be very expensive and it would take a long time to mount them.The existing facilities at Christmas Island are in good repair and couldbe adapted in two ox- three months, and the ax-eais large enough to accommodate the several thousand people needed for a large seriesof tests rapidly conducted.   There is also space on the island for thelarge number of instruments needed.   The Americans would not, however,propose to conduct at Christmas Island the whole of the new series of tests which they have in mind.   The very high altitude tests would bemade elsewhere.   They also indicated that they would refrain from makingat Christmas Island any tests involving explosions on the ground or inbarges, which would entail especially large danger of ground contamination.5*   Purposes of the proposed testsThe President and his advisers explained in some detailexactly what they wished to achieve by the proposed series qf tests.These would include high altitude tests to measure effects on missilescarrying nuclear warheads and on radar and radio communicationsj testsof existing warheads which might pave the way for weight reductions?and other tests of various advanced designs also with the aim of reducingweight.   The advantage of making warheads lighter is that decoysand other electronic deviaes can be carried.   All the proposed tests aretherefore directly related to the possibilities of developing or defeatingan anti-missile system.   It would be hard to argue that these are not&quot;necessary in order to maintain the balance of the deterrent&quot;.    the threat is not immediate but may become so even by 1964.6*   President Kennedy&apos;s attitudePresident Kennedy made it clear that he had not yet decidedto resume nuclear tests in the atmosphere.   He said specifically thathe wished to avoid taking this decision if he conscientiously could.   Atthe same time, he indicated that he was likely to decide in the spring of 1962 that tests must be resumed unless by then some substantial improvement had taken place in East/West relations.   And meanwhilehe felt that he could not avoid making the preparations necessary in order-2-
3-to enable the United States to resume testing if in three or four months&apos;time such a decision seemed right.   The President hoped that the UnitedKingdom v/ould agree both to support a United States decision to resumeatmospheric testing if this were made and to share in the tests by putting Christmas Island at the disposal of the United States.   He feltthat agreement on both these points should be simultaneous, althoughaction on the second would have to be taken before the first decision hadbeen made.7. I made clear the distaste with which the United Kingdom Govern--ment contemplated any further resumption of nuclear tests.   In particular,I expressed the strong view that the West should not resume nuclear tests unless they were satisfied that it was impracticable to halt the nuclear arms race.   Without prejudice to the immediate question, therefore;I proposed that the United States and the United Kingdom should jointlyconsider the possibility of some fresh initiative in the field of disarmament.president  Kennedy was not, I thought, opposed to such a plan in principle,but he could not see any practical method of carrying it out.   I undertook to let him have my detailed thoughts as soon as possible.8. On the immediate issue I explained that I could not agreeto the use of Christmas Island without consulting my Cabinet colleagues.I also told the President that a formal agreement would be necessaryabout American use of Christmas Island and proposed that our expertsshould consider this question at once without prejudice to any finaldecision.   Finally, I told President Kennedy that I recognised that, ifthe Cabinet decided to allow the United States to use Christmas Islandfor nuclear testing and the United States consequently devoted time and effort to preparations on the island, it would be unreasonable for theUnited Kingdom Government to claim more than a right to be consulted about the final decision^  we could not ask for a veto at that stage.9. I therefore ask my colleagues to consider whether we should now agree to offer the United States Government the use of the facilities at Christmas Island for part of the series of atmospheric nuclear testswhich they may decide to hold in 1962.   Such an offer would be madeon ther understanding that:- -(a) A formal agreement must first be concludedon the financial and administrative arrangementsfor the use of these facilities.(b) The President would consider carefully and consult the United Kingdom before taking a finaldecision to resume tests.(c) We would support whatever decision president kennedy made.I think myself that such an offer should also be made conditional on united States acceptance in principle of a Western initiative to haltthe nuclear arms race by agreement.10., On this basis I believe that we could: -
(a) Defend  a decision to bring Christmas island to a state of readiness for renewed testing,&quot;as a matter of prudent planning for the future&quot;,in the words of the Bermuda communique,(b) Defend an eventual United States decision to hold the further series of atmospheric tests which theyhave in mind as necessary to maintain the balanceof the deterrent and which would therefore be within the terms of the public statements madeby President Kennedy and myself on 1st november and 31st October respectively.I-T.M.Admiralty House, S.
