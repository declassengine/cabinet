C.J.6J14024th February, 1962COPY NO.CABINETUGANDA - FINANCIAL settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesUganda, is due to become indpendent on 9th October and internal self-government to be introduced on 1st March.   At that stage responsi-bility for the oversea service officers will pass from me to ExecutivePublic Service Commissions in Uganda.   At that time a compensation scheme for these officers must be introduced.     If a compensation scheme could not be implemented,  self-government could not be introduced.   Andif this were the reason for postponement the delay would be clearly seen tobe the result of difficulties over safeguarding the interests of overseaofficers.2.      Before the Uganda Government are prepared to introduce ascheme on the lines that I consider essential, they wish to know what assistance Her Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to give to help themfinance their share of the cost, given Uganda&apos;s poverty and serious difficulties on recurrent account.   Talks have taken place in London inthe last few days with a Uganda Government delegation on this question and on certain other requests from Uganda for aid after independence,primarily with their development plan.   The Annex shows what they have requested and the Treasury and Colonial Office views of what needs tobe given.3.      The figures proposed by the Treasury have been put to theUganda delegation.   They were distressed that the offer on compensationfell short of their request and they considered the amount of additionaldevelopment loan assistance to be quite inadequate, particularly as thegreater part of our aid would be given during the present Ugandafinancial year, before independence.     They intimated that, although theywould have to report back to Uganda, they could not see how it would bepossible for the Uganda Government to accept an offer so manifestlyinferior, both absolutely and relatively, to the aid given to Tanganyikalast summer.4.      After the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs explained the position the delegation postponed their return to Uganda, till Tuesday, 27th February.I am convinced that we shall not achieve a settlement with less than theColonial Office proposals shown in the Annex, and that the consequences of not achieving a.settlement (or of having a breakdown on the basis ofsuch a demonstrably meagre offer) would be serious politically and would-1-
lead to our having ultimately to offer considerably more aid than I howrecommend.   Experience over Tanganyika shov/s that it is a mistake toput forward a proposal that stands no chance of acceptance.   I should    .have preferred to have put to the Uganda delegation my original proposalsinstead of the Treasury offer - and I believe that a settlement would havebeen achieved had this been done - and now that the Treasury offer has failed to secure acceptance I am sure that we must revert to something like them as now set out in the Annex.5.      I shall have to put these proposals to Uganda on Tuesday.    Thisis the latest time if the compensation schsme is to be endorsed by theUganda legislature by the end of February and the compensation schemeenter into force on 1st March.   Unless the compensation scheme is accepted by then I shall have to defer the introduction of self-government,and while from some points of view this might not be unacceptable, theneed to provide for suitable compensation terms for European officers would be the worst of reasons for deferment.6.      I believe that my proposals can be presented in a way which offerssome chance of success.   Although the Uganda Government clearlyattach primary importance to the amount of compensation aid, wecannot expect to achieve a settlement without making a reasonablecontribution to their development plan and my proposals include what I regard as the reasonable minimum.   Taken as a whole, the proposalsrepresent a saving of nearly  4 million over the next two yea^s on what we expected to have to provide for Uganda, and included in the aidceiling figures for those years.7. I invite my colleagues to agree that I should make an offer tothe Uganda Government on the lines of the Colonial Office proposals in the Annex.R.M.Colonial Office, S. W.l.23rd February, 19624-2-
