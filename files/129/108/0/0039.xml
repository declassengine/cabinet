f..IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)f&quot;C. (62) 3923rd February, 1962COPY NO.s bCABINETgUBMC^SXPENDITURENote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer   -On 22nd February I mentioned the statement which I proposedto make in the House of Commons on Tuesday, 27th February, on thepublication of the Vote on Account (C. C. (62) 15th Conclusions,Minute 3).     I annex a draft of my statement for any comments mycolleagues may wish to make.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.23rd February, 1962.
ANN]statement on vote on account to be made. q^&quot;Yyth&quot;februaryv 1962&quot;&quot;&quot;Draft by the Chancellor of the exchequer said in my Budget speech last year that I would put in handa study of the whole problem of public expenditure in relation to the prospective growth of our resources for a period of five years ahead.The Report of the Plowden Committee published last Julyendorsed this approach, and the Government have accepted- all therecommendations of that Report.     My rt. hon. Friend, the Chief .Secretary, has been appointed to help me in implementing them.     As,however, the Plowden Committee itself recognised, the scope for making large savings quickly is limited.On 25th July last year, I said to the House that I would domy utmost to keep the increases in the 1962/63 Estimates to a levelof not more than Zj per cent in real terms, in other words after taking into account increases in rates of pay and prices.The Estimates for 1962/63 total  5, 611 million.     They show,on a comparable basis, an increase of  384 million over last year&apos;budget estimates.     Had it not been for drastic pruning, including a wide range of savings in administrative costs, this figure wouldhave been much higher.    In fact more than one quarter of the CivilVotes have been brought lower than they were last year.    Of theincrease,  139 million is due to increases in rates of pay and prices.The balance of  245 million is the increase in real terms.     Thefigure for a 2jr per cent increase would have been  134 million.Therefore the Estimates exceed my target by  111 million.Seven-eighths of the increase of  384 million is accountedfor by six large items.    Agricultural support requires  66 million more,the railways deficit  43 million.    These two items together are 109 million.    Defence, together with related elements now in CivilVotes, requires nearly  100 million more.     The increases in generaland rate deficiency grants to local authorities call for another 86 million - mainly to finance education, including the higher pay for teachers.    National Health Service expenditure is up by 27 million and that on roads by another  15 million.These Estimates, because of the way in which we presentour accounts, include both current and capital expenditure.     Butpublic service investment, both by the local authorities and theGovernment, is of particular importance in connection with theEstimates, because much of it carries with it future claims for-1-
increased Government current spending.     The object, therefore,must be to maintain a steadily expanding programme of publicservice investment while making sure it v/ill be within our means.As the White Paper published last October showed, publicservice investment in 1962/63 is planned to increase by 6 per cent over this year.     We are working to plans which are based on hold-ing the aggregate rate of increase in 1963/64 at the same percentage increase.     I believe that is of the greatest importance.The task of containing public expenditure both on current and capital account is made harder by the constant pressure in this house and elsewhere for higher Government spending on many different objectives;   each may he desirable in itself, but collectivelybeyond what can be afforded. The more that we can achievesound growth in the economy, the more we can afford to spend.But that sound grov/th must come in present circumstances fromgrowth in our exports.     I believe that the measures I have takenin the last few months, including the pay pause, v/ill help to achievethat, and that, if we can by common consent carry out a sensibleincomes policy, our export prospects are good,m/23rd.
