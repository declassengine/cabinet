C. (62) 30 Copy No.    g fj12th February, 1962 . - - -CABINETROTODYNENote by the Minister of aviation annex a memorandum which was prepared for the Defence Committee on the Rotodyne. It is for various reasons desirable to reach a conclusion on thefuture of this project if possible at the same time as we consider the paper onthe Light Cargo Aircraft.2. Though cancellation of this project will involve me in further problems with the aircraft industry, I feel compelled to recommend, on the assumption thatthe Avro 748 is selected for the Light Cargo Aircraft requirement, that theRotodyne be cancelled.P. T.Ministry of Aviation,9th February, 1962.60397Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1962 t*.
ANNEXFUTURE OF THE ROTODYNEMemorandum by the Minister of Aviationlit:For some years past our policy in regard to large helicopters has been basedon the Rotodyne, a unique project offering considerable promise in both civil andmilitary applications. The stage has now been reached, however, whendevelopment can no longer continue in the absence of a production order. either a firm order should be placed now, or the project should be dropped altogether.History of the Project2. The technical originality of the Rotodyne lies in a combination of theprinciples of rotary and fixed wing flight, by haying a rotor for vertical lift andpropellers for forward propulsion; because of this, the Rotodyne offers considerable advantages over conventional helicopters in size, speed, and operating costs. Atpresent, there is no competitor anywhere in the world in the same class.3. The project began as a private venture in 1947. From 1950-57 theGovernment supported it, together with the development of the Eland 3 engine, asa research project. The costs were borne partly on the Defence Budget and partly as a charge to civil votes. During 1958 and 1959 the Government contributionwas withdrawn owing to the absence of a firm requirement for the Eland poweredaircraft. However, plans for a new and better version of the Rotodyne incorporatingthe Tyne engine were evolved, which was much more attractive to British european airways. It was also of great interest to the Service Departments, and a militaryrequirement was approved by the Defence Board in June, 1959. Consequently, anew development contract was placed in February, 1960, under which theGovernment undertook to provide one half of the future development costs, withina maximum of  4 million- When Westlands took over Fairey Aviation and other companies to form the present helicopter group, it was made clear to them that theGovernment attached great importance to the Rotodyne project continuing inaccordance with the terms of the contract.4. It was also announced early in 1960 that negotiations would be opened bythe manufacturers with British European Airways, in respect of a civil order(initially for six aircraft), and with the Ministry of Aviation in respect of a militaryorder. An agreement was reached with British European Airways whereby theGovernment would contribute up to  1-4 million towards the costs of introducing the Rotodyne into service. It was expected that the contract negotiations with the manufacturers would take some time since detailed technical specifications had tobe worked out. After two years, however, neither of these orders has yet beenplaced, and while considerable interest has been aroused in oversea markets(particularly in the United States) this in itself is not a sufficient basis to enable the project to proceed.The Military Requirement5. The Service requirement for a fleet of 12 Rotodynes approved by ministers in June 1959 was based on the need to provide a short range, vertical take-off and land (VTOL), light cargo lift to support forces operating in the field. It is designedto be independent of prepared airstrips which are difficult and expensive in manpower to construct and maintain, particularly in thickly-wooded or mountainouscountry, and often unusable in heavy rainfall. It would give much greater flexibilityto a commander because he would not have to base his deployment on the availability or construction of airstrips. It would also avoid the need for transferring loads from short take-off and land (STOL) to VTOL aircraft and vice versa, with consequent administrative overheads, delays and discomfort tocasualties. Finally, the Rotodyne is capable of being used as a crane. The only other large VTOL aircraft being ordered for the Royal Air Force the Belvedere lacks the heavy lift capacity of the Rotodyne. Without the latter it will not bepossible to carry such equipment as engineer assault bridging and other heavy
bridging equipment direct to bridging sites, nor will it be possible to lift armoured cars and a number of items of engineer equipment necessary for the constructionof airstrips. Nevertheless, in their recent report on British strategy in the 1960sthe Chiefs of Staff reluctantly conclude that provided that they have a suitable fleet of light cargo aircraft the additional operational advantages afforded by theRotodyne are not so essential as to justify, against the stringent financial background of their study, the capital and running costs involved ( 14 million and  2 million per annum respectively).The Civil Requirement6. British European Airways have recently expressed the view to me thatthere are considerable doubts about the economic operation of the Rotodyne ina civil role. I am at present consulting British United Airways as to whether theywould be interested in operating the Rotodyne on the terms that were offered toBritish European Airways. But whatever their answer may be, the project cannot continue without a military as well as a civil production order. Equally, if therewere no civil requirement, the cost of. meeting a military requirement for only12 Rotodynes would become prohibitive.The Consequences of Cancellation7. If it were decided not to proceed with the Rotodyne the consequences would be as follows. In the military field, the Services would lose the only heavylift aircraft with a vertical take-off and landing capability available before the1970s, capable of undertaking the tasks described in paragraph 5 above. - In thecivil field, we should be abandoning a project which is unique of its kind and mightachieve a break-through in export markets, without having any other plans for developing an alternative British helicopter in this class. Complaints would bemade that the Government were failing to carry out their declared policy of supporting the civil industry, and that little purpose had been served in encouraging the formation of a helicopter group when its main forward-looking project was tobe abandoned.Financial Considerations8. If the development contract is cancelled (and under the terms of the contract Westlands can require us to cancel it if we do not place a militaryproduction order within a reasonable time) the Government become liable for expenses incurred since September 1959. It is estimated that the total liabilitymight amount to between  2 million and  3 million. If we add the payments madeby the Government on earlier research contracts (for airframe and engine 11 million), the total nugatory expenditure on the project would be in theneighbourhood of  14 million.9. If we decide to persevere with the project, the total cost to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be considerable. A military production order costing  14 million would be the minimum required. So far as development costs are concerned, inaddition to the balance of the contribution of  4 million already promised toWestlands for the airframe, there have recently been proposals for further enginedevelopment (the RB-176) which would cost Her Majesty&apos;s Government 3-5 million. Further, we have undertaken to contribute  T4 million towardslosses in introducing the Rotodyne into service. Finally, there would be a contingent liability involved in giving the first civil operator an indemnity againstlimitations on operating the Rotodyne in London on account of noise.10. I invite my colleagues to consider whether, in the circumstances described in this paper, they are content that the Rotodyne should be abandoned. If the answer is &quot; Yes &quot;, it will become all the more important to reach early decisions about other future projects in the aircraft industry, as urged in mv Cabinet paper c. (61) 150 of 6th October last.P. T.Ministry of Aviation, W.C. 2,8th February, 1962.
