C. (62) 34COPY NO. S 6CABINETREVISION OF MACHINERY FOR THE SETTLEMENT&quot;OF TEACHERS&apos; REMUNERATION^The Economic Policy Committee at their meeting on14th February, asked me to submit to the Cabinet the proposal for postponing legislation designed to z-evise the Burnham machinery setout in the attached paper.2. The short point is that a Bill to give the Minister powersto prescribe scales in the event of deadlock between the two sides ofthe Committee or to revise an agreed settlement recommended by them(he now has only a power of veto) would meet great opposition from the teachers, and the local authorities are pledged to support the teachersif the Bill is introduced before the Governments long-term policy on incomes has been more fully worked out.3. After this has been done I consider I could get the Billwith much less opposition, particularly from the local authorities.Postponement would also very much strengthen the influence of the moderates on the National Union of Teachers.4. In the meantime I can - and will - use my power of veto if,during the summer, the Committee put to me a recommendation thatI cannot approve.D. E.Ministry of&apos; Education, W.I.16th February, 196 2
ANNEXREVISION OF MACHINERY FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF TEACHERS&apos; REMUNERATIONMemorandum by Minister of EducationAt their meeting on 2nd October last the Economic PolicyCommittee agreed that the Minister of Education should seek powers to enable him to prescribe salary scales for teachers if the Burnham Committee were unable to reach agreement or, after the Minister had referred back to themwith his reasons a recommendation he could not accept, re-submitted anunac ceptable agreement.2.     Shortly afterwards the Burnham Committee agreed to recommend scales of pay within the limits I had set, but I still thought it wise to give theHouse, during the Debate on the Address on 3rd November, a broad indication of my proposals for legislation, as it seemed more likely than not that weshould need to go ahead with it.3.     My proposals have now been discussed separately with the associations oflocal authorities and teachers and an important new factor has been introduced.   If we press our legislation the teacherb will demand that aprovisi&amp;n for^arbitration between the two sides of the Burnham Committeeshould be included.   The local authorities have said that while this would notbe welcome to them they could not possibly oppose it.    The (government might also find it diffi&amp; ult to oppose it, having regard to our recent statementsabout the value of arbitration,4.     But to insert arbitration into the Burnham machinery for the first timewhen the national policy on incomes is still jn the melting pot would in my view be a mistake.    The object of a reform in Burnham is to bring the national interest more clearly and fruitfully into the picture and the Authoritiesand the teachers have said that they will oppose legislation until they see how it fits in with the new national arrangements.I believe therefore that&apos; it would be better to postpone legislationuntil the national policy has been more fully worked out.   This would mean that a negotiation on salaries this summer, which the Local Authoritieshave promised, would be c&amp;nducted on past lines except that I should givethe Committee more information about the supply/demand estimates than theyhave had on previous occasions.   My guess is that the Committee will reach a deadlock at the next review, and this will strengthen the need for legislation.5.     The choice before us is to legislate now with strong pressure to insertarbitration, which I am very reluctant to do, or to postpone legislation untilthe Burnham Committee can see what the national policy looks like.   I think weshould adopt the latter course.*They ?/ill also press for arbitration between the Committee and theMinister, but both sides know I would not contemplate this and the localauthorities would support me in resisting it.1 .
6,     If my colleagues agree, I shall put it to both sides that 1* am notabandoning tho idea of legislation but postponing it to give them the chance to see that the teachers are net being singled out in advance of the formulation of a long-term incomes policy.   I shall make it plain that /theprice of postponement is that in the event of deadlock they can rely onnobody but themselves to resolve it;   and that if they submit agreed proposals which I judge to be contrary to the national interest I shallhave&apos;no compunction in rejecting them, even though it means, as theycomplained last time, that they have laboured in vain or that the teacherscan have no increase at all until they submit agreed scales that I findacceptable,7,     In order to improve the working of the existing machinery I shall, atthe outset of negotiations, give them any information about the needs ofthe schools that is relevant in a salaries context.    I shall also let themknow that if I&apos; have occasion to reject their recommended scales I shall give my reasons and, if I think fit, set a limit beyond which theGovernment will not go.   I had originally intended to prevent unrealisticdiscussions by naming a global sum .as a maximum while they were still inthe course of negotiation, but both sides are opposed to this on the ground,that it would leave little or no room for genuine negotiation,8.     To sum up, at the present stage of the development of our incomes policy, and bearing in mind the emphasis we have put on the value ofarbitration, legislation to revise Burnham machinery introduced now mightweaken our chances of resisting salary increases for teachers that were out of line with our incomes policy,,D.E.Ministry of Education, w.l.,5th February, 1962
