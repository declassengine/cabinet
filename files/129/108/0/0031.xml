Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1962C. (62) 31 Copy No.    5023rd February, 1962CABINETBERLINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs annex for the information of my colleagues copies of three interestingtelegrams from our Ambassador in Washington, Sir David Ormsby Gore, about his conversation with President Kennedy on the Defence White Paper and Berlin.2. President Kennedy is obviously dissatisfied with the meagre response ofhis European Allies to the military build-up which the Americans carried throughlast autumn in order to make Mr. Khrushchev realise that they meant businessover Berlin. The President seems to doubt whether the extra United States effortcan be maintained indefinitely in view of the lack of a matching contribution from western Europe. No doubt political pressures connected with the mid-termelections this autumn are making themselves felt.3. In talking to Sir David Ormsby Gore the President directed his criticismalmost entirely against the French and Germans, in particular against the contrastbetween the rigidity of their position over Berlin negotiations and their refusal to make a military contribution which would make Mr. Khrushchev take theirtoughness seriously. The President obviously feels that Dr. Adenauer andGeneral de Gaulle simply want to stand pat -/behind the United States build-up.We must recognise, however, that the President and most of his advisers are almost as disappointed at what seems to them the inadequacy of the British military effort as they are about the Franco-German performance.4. President Kennedy is determined to do something but has not yet decidedhis plan of action. It seems that he is considering an effort to confront Dr. Adenauerwith the choice between making concessions to the Russians or accepting the riskof war which would be involved in a continued policy of standing firm. This might suggest that he is willing to leave Dr. Adenauer with the choice of peace or war;but it cannot really be so. The ultimate choice must rest with the United States,and Dr. Adenauer will be aware of this. The defence of West Berlin has becomealmost as much a touchstone of United States prestige in Europe as a symbol ofeventual reunification for the Germans. It must therefore be questionable whetherPresident Kennedy will be able to force Dr. Adenauer to make a definite choiceand draw the necessary consequences, even if he makes the attempt. He tried tomake Dr. Adenauer see reason in Washington last November and seemed to havehad some temporary success. But, to judge from the current German attitude tothe talks between Mr. Thompson, the United States Ambassador in Moscow, andMr. Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, the effect has now largely worn off and the Germans are once more closer to the French position than to theAnglo-American.5. If we assume that this time President Kennedy does bring effective pressure to bear on Dr. Adenauer, it is not clear what concessions he intends to make himaccept. They may be over Berlin, over all-German matters or over nuclear weapons and European security. No firm conclusion is possible from President Kennedy&apos;reference to &quot; New arrangements over West Berlin . . . without any serious risks to our basic interest &quot;. It is not safe to assume that the President is now thinking60457a
of offering the Russians the sort of terms on sovereignty of the DeutscheDemokratische Republik, recognition of frontiers, and control of nuclear weapons which we should consider acceptable. He may not be willing to go at all as faras we should.6. We must, I think, now wait for President Kennedy to decide how to playhis hand. He is fully aware of our views on these &quot; wider questions &quot;, and this is,.no! a good moment for trying to press them as British suggestions. Nor is thereiany case for a British initiative to try and influence the Franco-German attitude.We must proceed cautiously both because our own position on the militarybuild-up is a disappointment to the Americans and because good relations withour two main European allies matter very much to us for weighty reasonsunconnected with Berlin. Only President Kennedy is in a position to bring pressure to bear on Dr. Adenauer. The attitude of General de Gaulle will also have to beconsidered.7. The course which the Berlin crisis now takes may be determined by president Kennedy&apos;s tactics. If he prevails on Dr. Adenauer to agree to the concessions necessary in order to interest the Russians in a negotiated settlementover Berlin, and if Dr. Adenauer then gives the necessary instructions to the lowerechelons on the German side who have been so obdurate up to now, we maybe able to find a way forward by keeping the Thompson-Gromyko talks goingfor the present and having an East-West Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting at theappropriate moment. Mr. Thompson is due to have another talk with Mr. Gromykobefore long. We await draft instructions from Washington. If, on the otherhand, the conclusion of the Kennedy-Adenauer dialogue were that the western powers should stand firm and make no concessions, we should probably wish topoint out to the Americans that one could not be certain even in these circumstances that Dr. Adenauer would really refuse all concessions once negotiations werejoined. He has revealed a pathological aversion in the past to showing his handin advance of dealings with the Russians. He stretched a few points during the geneva Conference in 1959, however, when this was clearly the only alternative to a breakdown and when the Americans pressed him. He might do the sameagain, once negotiations were under way and had run into difficulties. If all efforts to find a basis for talking about Berlin to the Russians end in failure, perhaps aproposal for a Summit Meeting without agenda will offer a way out. But thetime must be carefully chosen.8. Generally speaking I think we should welcome an effort by president kennedy to place more responsibility on the Federal German Government forthe painful decisions which probably have to be faced. In the end, the Germansmust say what price they are ready to pay for retaining the Western position in west Berlin. Naturally we should not want the pressure to be so strong that itdrove the Germans into a reversal of their whole policy of Western alignment and caused them to make a separate deal with the Russians; but I do not think thereis great danger of this. When it comes down to it, the West Germans have too much to lose to risk war for the sake of West Berlin or even for the sake ofreunification, and at the final &quot; crunch &quot; it is likely to be they who will want tomake the concessions. This being so, it would not be in the British interest toinstigate prematurely a campaign of pressure upon them.9. As a next step, and pending a reply from Mr. Khrushchev, I propose to instruct our Ambassador at Washington to find out what concessions president kennedy considers the Germans should be ready to accept at the right time andwhen and how he thinks of putting these to them. The Ambassador will remind the Americans of our ideas whenever he considers that this will help.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1962.
ANNEXCopies of telegrams from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington to the Foreign office i talked to the President about this yesterday. His concern is not that theWhite Paper constitutes a new defence policy, but that it is a continuation of theprevious policy without sufficient consideration of the present state of the world,and in particular the serious Soviet threats over West Berlin.2. The President himself is convinced that what caused Khrushchev topause last autumn was his knowledge that the United States still maintained apreponderance of military might and in reply to the Russian threats during the summer had been prepared to step up its defence efforts still further. from august on the Russians had come to believe that if they pressed the West too hardover Berlin, they ran a serious risk of a major collision with a more powerfulUnited States. This being so, the President feels that the one way to ensure anincrease in tension over Berlin is for Khrushchev to be persuaded that whatever the americans might say or do, the Europeans themselves were prepared to give way and there was a real danger that Khrushchev would come to this conclusion inview of the minimal additional effort that America&apos;s other NATO Allies were now making in the military field. If the European nations continued to pursue a moreor less business-as-usual attitude, then Khrushchev would not take seriously theirtough talk about West Berlin.3. It is fundamentally this business-as-usual approach to our defence problems that the President, McNamara and Rusk find disturbing at the present time, and,as regards details, I think they are all convinced that we cannot make an equitableand effective contribution in the conventional field without some form of selectivecall-up. In these circumstances I was unable to make much headway with thePresident over these basic worries regarding our defence policy. But I think Iwas able to reassure him over some of the details.4. On the question of a build-up to meet the Berlin situation, I pointed outthat legislation was at this moment going through Parliament which would enable us to retain national servicemen in the forces for an additional six months. this meant that those we retained would not be released until the autumn. this legislation would also enable us to recall reservists to the forces at very short notice in order to fill critical gaps. I also,told him that I believed we were in theprocess of forming a strategic reserve division in the United Kingdom which wouldbe able to move at short notice to the Continent if a deterioration in the Berlinsituation made this necessary. (I understand this to be the situation, although Ican find no specific reference to it in the draft White Paper we have here.)5. On the question of our retaining an independent nuclear deterrentthroughout the 1960s, I told the President that this phrase was not an accuratesummary of what would appear in the White Paper. What we did say there wasthat the V-bomber force, with first Blue Steel and then with Skybolt equipment,would continue to be effective throughout the 1960s and could therefore continueto make a contribution to the Wesfs nuclear deterrent over this period. no statement was made in the White Paper that would rule out the consideration ofany new arrangements which might be agreed for the deployment and control ofthe West&apos;s nuclear forces.6. To sum up, my judgment would be that although the President, in company with his Chief Advisers, will continue to be privately disappointed over our defence policy, he will feel that the harm that he saw resulting from the publication of theWhite Paper would be considerably mitigated if we were:(a) able to stress that we were in fact taking steps in the conventional field toincrease the effectiveness of our forces along the lines of my paragraph above; and(b) able to make it clear that our proposal to retain and to keep up to dateour V-bomber force was not designed to prejudice the issue of themethod of control over and deployment of nuclear weapons in the nato Alliance.60457
7. I do not imagine that we wish publicly to stress unduly the effect of our balance of payments difficulties upon our defence policy, but I expect the PrimeMinister will wish to deal with this aspect of the matter in his personal reply tothe Presidents letter. Indeed this might be a good opportunity for driving home to him that what seriously diminishes our ability to maintain our forces on theContinent of Europe is the extent to which all the major German arms orders are scooped up by the Americans.I saw Mr. Rusk this morning about our White P^per. I made the same points to him as I had made to the President. He said he was grateful for the explanationand said that his chief concern was that we should stress whatever we were doingspecifically to make our forces more effective in the context of the Berlin situationand in the second place that we should make no statement about our nuclear weapons policy which prejudged the coming discussions in NATO.My discussion with the President about our defence policy led naturally intoa talk about the Berlin situation. The President was clearly very dissatisfied withthe present state of affairs. He had assumed that the tough, burdensome andunpopular measures taken by the United States would buy for the West a breathing space in which they could work out a negotiating position that had some chance ofbeing acceptable to the Soviet Union. In practice, none of America&apos;s european allies who were most closely affected by the Berlin situation had made a comparablemilitary effort. On the contrary, they had used the breathing space provided to sittight, do nothing and hope for the best. Least of all had they shown anydetermination to work out a sensible negotiating position. He did not regard this as a responsible policy and he was becoming less and less convinced that any of theEuropean nations cared enough about West Berlin to take any of the unpopularsteps which would be required in order to bring about some solution to the problem.Either we must decide that there were no changes or concessions of any consequencewhich were acceptable to us, in which case it would be necessary for us to build up our forces and make it clear by deeds as well as words that the Russians couldinterfere with our position in Berlin only at their extreme peril; or we decided thatwe believed that new arrangements over West Berlin might be negotiated with theRussians without any serious risk to our basic interests, in which case our presentapproaches in Moscow were really a waste of time as no one thought for onemoment that our present proposals would have any attraction for the Russians.2. The President went on to say that apparently the French and Germangame was to make the Americans carry the main responsibility for the whole problem. He himself was expected either to threaten nuclear war in order to preserve the present status quo in Berlin with the fairly clear indication that ifKhrushchev called his bluff he would in fact be asked not to start the war he hadbeen threatening. Alternatively, he was expected to make concessions in order toreach an agreement with the Russians which the French and the Germans could then blame him for if the result turned out to be unsatisfactory. The President was quite clear that he was not prepared to allow this situation to continue and he believes that in Adenauer lies the key to the whole situation. He told me that hehad had a long meeting with Rusk and the European experts from the state department and he has told them that he now intends to take a personal day-to-dayresponsibility for handling United States policy in this field. He has not yet made up his mind of the best way to approach Adenauer, but his first thoughts are toconfront him with the blunt alternatives of deciding against serious negotiations- and preparing in the last analysis to fight a war, or of deciding in favour of negotiations which have some hope of a successful outcome. Put like this, he would hope and expect that Adenauer would exert himself in favour of the second alternative. &apos; &apos;--
3. I told the President that we also had grave doubts about allowing thesituation to drift on in the hope that Khrushchev would decide to do nothing toounpleasant. We could not really understand the extremely negative and defensiveattitude of the French and Germans who always seemed to imagine that increasedcontacts with the Communists would be dangerous for the West and not for theEast. I thought that this was the reverse of the truth and we should not forget thatthe 1955 Summit, although it achieved no concrete results, did create an atmosphere of detente which was quickly followed by the rise to power of Gomulka in poland and an anti-Communist revolution Hungary.4. At this point I put to the President your thoughts about summitry (yourtelegram No. 1375). I told him that we felt that we ought to keep in mind thepossibility of a Summit meeting some time early this summer. In the meantime weshould avoid saying anything which would subsequently require us to eat our wordsshould we decide that a meeting of Heads of Government could not be avoided.The President immediately said that he would be perfectly prepared to go to aSummit meeting, but if it was to be in the disarmament context some progress must first have been made in the Geneva negotiations. He did not seem to think thatthere had been any marked enthusiasm for the idea of an Eighteen-Power summit meeting. With the possible exceptions of Egypt and Burma the response from the eight neutral members of the committee had been very cautious and even egypt and Burma had not fully committed themselves in favour of Khrushchev&apos;s proposal.He therefore saw no reason to suppose that we would be stampeded into a summit meeting. However, he repeated that he would be perfectly happy to go if it seemed that such a meeting could do good. But he found it difficult to see how it could doany good, unless the Russians had first of all displayed some desire to talk seriouslyabout disarmament.
