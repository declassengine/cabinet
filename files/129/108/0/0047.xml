C. (62) 47 .        Copy No.    507th March, 1962CABINETINVESTMENT IN THE PRIVATE SECTORMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 31st January the Economic Policy Committee considered two papers onthe possibility of reducing building investment in the private sector. The first was by the Minister of Housing and the second was by the Minister of Works. TheCommittee took the view that a return to building licensing was undesirable; thePrime Minister has now suggested that the Cabinet ought to have a chance toconsider the arguments.Arguments for . The Minister of Housing contends that, although we seek to plan public investment, which accounts for about two-fifths of all new constructional work,our plans are vulnerable to any unexpected increase in the uncontrolled three-fifthsaccounted for by private investors; existing regulations in the private sector areuncertain and uneven in their effect and what is needed is some permanent methodof programming work in the private sector just as much as in the public: whateverdecisions are taken on the growth of public service investment we do want to besure that the agreed programmes can go steadily ahead without being thrown out by a lack of control over the rate of growth of investment in the private sector,which in many cases will contribute less, and be seen to contribute less, to national productivity.3. If we possessed a control over building there is little doubt that it wouldhave formed a useful part of the armoury against inflation and that, had we had it,this control would have been used in 1956-57 and 1961. Moreover, it is obviouslywasteful if the time-gap between starts and completions in the private sectorincreases a half-finished factory locks up resources and makes no positivecontribution to our national economic performance.Arguments Against4. The Minister of Works sees no advantage, and some positive disadvantages,in the introduction of direct building controls. He considers that a system of rationing is unnecessary at a time when, in his view, there is no prospect of heavyoverload upon the construction industries. Direct controls could involve elaborate,and onerous, arrangements for collecting information and could be costly and difficult to administer. Moreover, to adopt a restrictive policy would only deferdemand for building; not reduce it permanently, and could be quite inappropriateat a time when we are seeking an expansion of the capacity of the construction industries.: 5. Apart from these arguments on substance, it would appear strange forthe Government to reintroduce building controls before the National economic development Council has started work. Having set up the Council, it would bedifficult to decide to make a big change of this sort without the representativesof private industry having a chance to comment.60506Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1962
General Discussion6. The general view of the Economic Policy Committee was that if; therewere any point in reducing the rate of growth in the programmes for housing and other public service investment it was not because of the danger of theoverload on the building industry, but because of the need to prevent the continuedrise in the proportion of national resources going into the public sector. Thiswould otherwise be likely to interfere with the primary task of making the private sector more competitive in export markets. Having once decided to use monetarymeasures to restrain excessive demand in the economy, it would be unwise to seek different remedies as soon as difficulties appeared.7. The Committee accordingly agreed that no further study should be madeof possible systems of building licensing but they took note of the difficultieswhich might arise from local overloading, and supported the suggestion that thebuilding industry itself should be encouraged towards voluntary co-operation inavoiding this danger. The Committee also recognised that there was an entirely separate planning problem arising out of the increasing congestion of Londonand other major cities on which the Home Affairs Committee are at presentawaiting a report. They also called for a report from officials on the co-ordinationof building programmes in the public sector in order to avoid local overloadingon the building industry.My Own Views8. We have had discussions about all this over a period of years, but I am bound to say that the arguments for any form of building control seem to meto be no stronger now than at any other time.9. The main argument advanced in favour of direct controls is thatrestraint of inessential investment in the private sector will release resources for essential investment in the public sector. This seems to me untrue in the longterm and, in so far as it is true in the short term, to be outweighed by counterarguments. What principally determines the volume of public service investment in the long term are the economic resources available, not the capacity of theconstruction industries. It does not follow that, if the load upon the construction industries is reduced, the size of the public service investment programmes can beincreased. What matters is the amount of economic resources which can be spared for public service investment, given the many competing claims upon thenation&apos;s resources.10. On the other hand I am more ready to agree that in periods of overloadon the construction industries restriction of private demand, whether by directcontrols Or other means, will release real resources and permit implementation ofsome public programmes to go ahead more quickly in the short term than would otherwise be the case. But I see considerable difficulties to attempting this formof regulation by direct building controls. In particular I would name thefollowing:(a) Direct controls would be expensive to administer.  Large numbers of newstaff would be needed both at the centre and in the regions and elaboratemachinery would be needed for the collection of information. the machine would be out of proportion to the purpose to be served.(b) Direct controls would also be very difficult to administer.   Areas wherethe construction industries are under such heavy pressure as to justifyregulation of private building are hard to define satisfactorily and theproblem of what criteria to apply in controlling private building is avery real one. For example office building has been suggested as a form of construction conspicuously in need of control. But it can be argued, very plausibly, that offices are as important a part of a modernexpanding economy as, for example, factories. With technologicaladvance it is expected that an increasing proportion of the working population will be employed at desks, and a decreasing proportion atbenches. Moreover, offices have not been overdeveloped. Demand hasbeen running ahead of supply. A similar case could be advanced forshops, garages and many other forms of miscellaneous building.
(c) There are also the practical difficulties of introducing new controls.Legislation must be secured and the large administrative machine set up.Even if decisions were taken now, any new scheme would be unlikely to be in effective operation before well into 1963, and in this intervalthere would, almost certainly, be a scramble in the private sector to getbuilding work started before the controls took effect. This would inevitably have a disruptive effect on the implementation of public sectorprogrammes. In other words the purpose of controls would be defeated,or at least frustrated, in the interval before their introduction. Couldnot this period be better devoted to the initiation of positive measuresto encourage and promote productivity in the construction industries?11. I attach much importance to this last point. I am sure that at the presenttime our first objective must be to promote increases in the capacity and efficiency of the construction industries, to encourage new building techniques and a newattitude to the training of skilled labour. Useful moves have already been made inthis direction. But to introduce direct controls would be to move in quite the opposite direction. To single out the construction industries for the application of restrictive physical controls must have a harmful effect upon the new attitudes weare endeavouring to foster; and to cut down deliberately the most profitable formof construction must divert capital resources from the industries to other parts ofthe economy. Our aim must be to make construction a major growth industry andwe must seek to achieve this by positive means.12. I therefore invite my colleagues to confirm the conclusion of theEconomic Policy Committee that no further study should be made of possiblesystems of building licensing, and to take note that the Committee asked thatstudies should be carried out on the co-ordination of investment to prevent localoverload upon the construction industries.13. My colleagues may also care to consider the development of systems of control, similar to those which are used for factory building, for the purposeof controlling office and other building in the middle of cities and in the greatconurbations. There is a good deal to be said for this as a matter of town planning policy, for the location of services is just as important as the location ofindustry. But it might be better to delay examination of this proposal until afterthe Home Affairs Committee have received the report which is being prepared on the possibility of planning measures to relieve the increasing congestion ofLondon and other major cities.S.
