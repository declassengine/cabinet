IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT;C. 162)3327th February, 1962COPY NO.   dCABINETTHE EFFECT ON HOUSEHOLDERS OFiREVALUATIONFOR RATES IN 1963Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and Minister for Welsh affairs there were widespread fears that the revaluation for rates in1963 would result in an intolerable shift of rate burden on to house-holders.    Accordingly, the Rating and Valuation Act, 1961, gave mepower by order for the period of the next valuation lists to de-ratedwellings (but no other category of property, except dwellingscombined with other properties) to the extent considered necessary.Decisions on this are now necessary so that the valuation can becompleted.2.      An essential preliminary,which the Home Affairs committee agreed on 21st February, is to provide a new scale of deductions fromgross to rateable value to take account of the increased cost of repairs.An equitable basis for this has been settled after consultation with the professional bodies concerned with rating and the associations of localauthorities.     It will require an affirmative order,3.      After taking account of the proposed new scale of deductions andof changes in rate-deficiency grants which result from the revaluation,the estimates for the country as a whole show no increase at all in the share of rates borne by householders.     There is power to make a differential order for individual counties and county boroughs.    In noarea is there expected to be an increase in the householders1 share of the sort of amount (33-f-per cent) which my predecessor told the House wouldbe intolerable and would entail a house de-rating order.     The highestincrease is about 27 per cent (Bournemouth) and the next highest is about20 per cent (Blackpool).     The position for each area is set out in.Appendix III of the attached draft White Paper.4.      One feature is common to the seaside places which top the list,namely that hotels and boarding houses are not doing particularly well,v/hich is one reason for the relatively large increase of the share ofburden borne by the houses.     To make a de-rating order for these areas would throw back part of the burden on to the hotels, and muchincrease the burden on the small amount of local industry.    It wouldalso disturb the basis on which River Board and other common expensesare shared.    Any de-rating order would be a deferment of the return
16ito a fully equitable basis for the rating system in rating all liableproperties at the full and on current values.    No order seems to benecessary.5.      There is a general awareness that the time for decision onthese matters is ripe.     There is a good deal of public alarm v/hichshould not be allowed to be used to our disadvantage.    We need toexplain the basis for the new order for scales of deduction from grossvalue and the estimates which show that a de-rating order is not necessary.     The attached draft White Paper is designed for thispurpose.C.H.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, S.W.1,27th February, 1962.-2-
Draft White PaperRevaluation for Rates in 1963The Rate Liability of the HouseholderA *      Statutory deduc tions for repairs,  etc.1.      Rates are levied,  at the rate in the   fixed by the ratingauthority,  on the rateable value of each rateable property inthe rating area.      The rateable value of the property is either the same as its net, annual value cr,  for the time being,(because of derating),  a proportion of that value..    Unless anorder derating houses is made,  in the valuation lists whichare due to come into force on 1st April 1963 the rateable values of all properties will be the same as their net annual values.2.      In broad terms,  the net annual value of a property is equivalent to the rent at which it might reasonably be expectedto let from year to year if the tenant were responsible for repairs,  insurance and other maintenance expenses.      For sometypes of property,  in particular factories, public utility undertakings, and land with or without ancillary buildings,  thenet annual value is estimated direct.      But for most properties,including houses,  shops,  offices, hotels,  and other non-industrial buildings, a gross value must first be found.      the gross value is the rent at which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year if the landlord were responsible for repairs, insurance and maintenance&quot;.      The net annual value is obtained by deducting from the gross value,  inaccordance with scales laid down by statute,  a sum representingthe notional cost of repairs,  insurance and maintenance.      Thepresent scales have not been altered since 1928:    the Rating and valuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,  1955 empowers theMinister to vary them by order.3.      In 1951,  after a survey of the records relating to manythousand-s of houses,  the Royal Institution of CharteredSurveyors expressed itself satisfied that in 1939 the actual expenditure on repairs,  insurance and maintenance was,  on average,   about equal to,  or slightly in excess of,   the relevantstatutory deduction.      In 1953,  the Girdwood Committee on &quot;Thecost of house maintenance&quot; estimated that if the cost ofmaintaining a house was put at 100 in 1939,  the cost -of doing the same amount of work in 1953 was 316.      An extension, of the calculations used for the Committee&apos;s report suggests that thepresent-day cost of similar work is i+52.4.      It is estimated that the average increase in the grossvalues of houses between 1939 and 1963 as a result of the 1956and 1963 general revaluations alone will bring them to about four times the 1939 figure. &apos; :5-      Taking these facts into account,  and after consultationwith professional associations concerned with rating,  the associations of local authorities and the London County Council,the Minister has decided to alter the scale with the broadobject of securing that houses which will have gross valuesabout four times the earlier figure shall have a statutorydeduction       times as large in 1963 as in 1939-- 1   -

Theto be raised from rates is settled by the localeable values are merely a method of sharing thisongst the ratepayers;    and,  if rateable valuese,  the poundage of rate correspondingly falls.    For1 householder,  it is the relationship of his ratingthe total which matters - hence this attention toch householders are likely to bear after revaluation.6.      The present scale applies equally to all types ofproperty assessed to gross value;    and it is proposed tocontinue this.    The proposed scale is reproduced in appendix Itogether with the existing provisions.7.      The scale, is intended to apply throughout England and Wales.At present the scale for the administrative county of London isat certain points different from that for other areas.    Thedifference affects gross values between  21  and  121 and is at most  4-    It is historical in origin and,  so far as is known,has never been related to any difference in the cost of repairs,etc., within and outside London.    The difference has particularlyunfair effects at the boundary of the administrative county,where adjacent and identical houses,  each of which may be liable for the same water rate and police rate, may as a result havedifferent rateable values.    To compensate to some extent for theassimilation of the two scales, the new scale has been designedto produce deductions midway between the.figures which theformer separate scales would have produced.
11.    It will be seen from the figures in appendix III that for england and Wales as a whole the change in the householders&apos;share is negligible.    lor individual counties and county boroughsthe changes may be summarised as follows;- &quot; ,Change in householders&apos;      No.  ofshare counties(D (2)Decrease of1 6fo or more11$ to 15$S0/o to 100/0Y/o to    5a/o5k1 217No.  ofcountyboroughs(3)761518No. of countiesandcounty boroughsIk)1 2102735No changeIncrease of1 60/o or more11$ to 15$6fo to 10fc1 to     5$126142571937133312.

It would be within the Minister&apos;s powers to make   an Orderderating houses solely in those few areas where the increas&quot;e inthe householders1  share is greatest, although none of them reachesthe figure which the then Minister gave to Parliament as clearly the making of an Order.warranting15.    Special local circumstances doubtless have their influence insome of these areas.    But one common factor is clearly that they all contain other categories of ratepayers who are not economicallystrong.    To derate houses in these areas and thus shift on to others part of the house burden would be to deprive these other categories of a measure of relief which their economic situationwarrants.    It would also disturb the basis of contribution toRiver Boards and other joint authorities.16.    The declared- objective in rating valuation is to secure thatall properties liable for rates are rated upon current values andthe full.    Any derating order for houses would be a postponementatofrevaluation thebe justified.that objective.

The change in share has been calculated by expressing thetotal rateable value of houses as a percentage of the totalrateable value of the area, both before and after the 1963revaluation.    The percentage which the difference constitutesof the share before the revaluation is taken as the change inshare (for examples,  if house rateable values constituted 50$of total rateable value before the 1963 revaluation,  and 52$after, the change in share would be + kfii    if the houseproportion had fallen to klfo, the change in share would be - 6fo)2.      The estimates of total rateable values have been foundedupon figures for properties so far valued by Valuation officers for the purposes of the 1963 Valuation List.    Propertiescompleted after 1st April 1961,  and also properties demolishedsince that date have been left out.3..     Certain properties are not subject to revaluation in thenormal way.    For the purpose of these calculations, adjustments to their values have been made as follows:(a)   water hereditamentss    the formula in paragraph k ofthe Second Schedule to the Rating and Valuation Act,1961&apos; has been followed as far as practicable;- k -SECRET
(b) gas and electricity hereditaments:    adjustments.willbe necessary by order requiring affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.Consultations about these adjustments are inprogress.    For present purposes it has been assumed that the same bases of adjustment as statutorilyapplies to water undertakers will be used.(c) Crown properties are revalued after the new listsare available,  the contributions in lieu of ratesbeing adjusted retrospectively when the new valueshave been determined...  Por the purpose of these calculations it has been assumed that propertiesoccupied for the purposes of.the Crown will increase in value in the same proportion as othercorresponding properties in the same area.In some areas these three categories of property account for asubstantial proportion of the total.    In those marked with anasterisk the proportion in the current lists exceeds 20$.k.      Consultations are in progress with the National Coal Boardand the local authority associations about the prescriptionunder section 3 of the Act of 1961  of a new method of valuingthe Board1s property.    That property is omitted from both pre-and post-valuation totals.5.     Rate-deficiency grant is payable to the councils of counties and county boroughs whose -penny rate product per headof population (weighted, in the case of counties,, for,sparsity)is below the national average.:   The effect,.:in general terms,is that in a county or county borough qualifying for grant theExchequer stands in as an additional ratepayer in respect ofthe deficiency of rate resources in the area.    The revaluationwill alter the degree of grant assistance, if any, given to individual areas.    In the present calculations rate-deficiencygrants have been calculated by reference to rateable valuesper head of population before and after the 1963 revaluation(there being no information about penny rate product afterrevaluation! and the change in the percentage&quot;of.grant has beentaken into account in assessing the changes in the householders&apos;share.- ./-:-.:-:;&apos; :,  ..-rv;. :-y ;6.
