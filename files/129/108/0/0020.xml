The Minister of Labour and I are agreed that the balanceof advantage lies in issuing a short White Paper as soon as we can andI attach a draft which I have agreed with the Minister and would propose,if my colleagues agree, to lay before Parliament on Friday, 2nd February.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.31st January, 1962.
draft WHITE PAPERINCOMES^POLIGY:   THE INTERMEDIATE PHASEhrtr^ductijgn1.       The Governmenfs policy is to promote economic growth andthe vitality of the British economy.     This depends on maintaining the strength of the pound and on our ability to keep prices stable andto compete effectively in markets overseas.    In pursuing this policy the Government are expecting to receive valuable assistance and advice from the National Economic Development Council.     But thepolicy will be put in jeopardy if money incomes rise faster than thevolume of national production, as has been the persistent tendencysince the end of the war.2.      The Government therefore consider it essential that increases in personal incomes of all kinds should be brought into a more realistic relationship with increases in national production.    they regard the pay pause as constituting the first phase in the achieve-ment of this objective.    As the Minister of Labour said in the Houseof Commons on 29th January, the Government intend to end thatphase on 31st March next.     This means that as from 1st April, 1962:-(a) effect will be given to certain wage and salary increases in the Civil Service and the national health Services which have been agreed since junly, 1961, and which have been held back for implementation on a date to be decided by theGovernment;(b) at the next review in April of the &quot;M&quot; rate for workers in Government employment, theworkers concerned will be offered what the review indicates at that time;(c) effect will be given to those parts of awards ofthe Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal andthe Industrial Court which have been heldin abeyance;(d) the effective date of pay increases will again be within the scope of negotiation and arbitra-tion in the Civil Service and National health services, except that increases will not bedated earlier than 1st April, 1962.CONFIDENTIAL
3.      In the debate in the House of Commons on 18th December, 1961,the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was the governments intention to try to work out with both sides of industry a policy tokeep increases in money incomes in line with the long-term rate of increase in national production.    He suggested briefly what themain elements in such a policy might be.    He explained, however,that, given the complexities of the problem, a long-term incomes policy of this sort would inevitably take a considerable time to workout.     The Government hoped, however, to make steady progress towards that end.4.      In the same speech the Chancellor emphasised that it wouldbe a negation of policy to bring the first phase, the pay pause, to anend and to put nothing in its place.    Accordingly, on 10th January,he invited the Trades Union Congress to collaborate withthe Government and with representatives of the employers&apos; organisa-tions in working out suitable arrangements for maintaining thenecessary restraining influence on the growth of incomes duringthe intermediate phase pending the evolution of a long-term incomes policy.     The T. U. C. , while recognising in their reply that it wasa condition of reasonable price stability that increases in incomes should keep in step with the growth of production, felt unable toaccept this invitation.    In these circumstances the Government arenow issuing this statement of the principles which, in their view,should govern decisions, during the intermediate phase, about thescale of increases in incomes.5.      The objective must be to keep the rate of increase of incomeswithin the long-term rate of growth of national production.    TheGovernment aim to secure a soundly-based increase in the rate of growth, so that real incomes will rise more rapidly than hitherto.For the moment, however, we must deal with things as they are.In recent years national production per head has risen by about to 2j? per cent a year and it seems likely to increase at about this rate in 1962.     It is accordingly necessary that the increase ofwages and salaries, as of other incomes, should be kept within this figure during the intermediate phase.     It follows that in theGovernments view there is no scope in 1962 for more than strictly limited increases in wages and salaries.     In many cases there mayindeed be no justification at present for any increases at all.    in others there may be particular circumstances which point the other way.6.      In considering increases in v/ages and salaries what matters for costs and prices is not simply the change in rates but the amountactually paid.     It will therefore be necessary to have regard to the likelihood, judged from past experience, that basic rates will inpractice be supplemented in certain employments by local or specialpayments.    Changes in pay made under particular agreements(e. g, , related to the cost of living) and reductions in hours or similar improvements will also have to be included in the reckoning.-2-CONFIDENTIAL
Criteria bearing on wage and salary proposals.      It is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules as to the criteria by which any given proposal for a wage or salary increase should be judged in the period immediately ahead.    But somearguments which have in the past been widely used to justify higher wages and salaries certainly ought not to be given the same weightas hitherto.    For example, arguments derived from the increased cost of living, or from the trends of profits or productivity in aparticular industry, cannot in present circumstances be regardedas providing of themselves a sound basis for an increase.     Theremay, however, be cases in which an increase could be justified aspart of an agreement under which the workers concerned made adirect contribution; by accepting harder work, more onerousconditions, or by a sacrifice of traditional practices, to an increaseof productivity and a reduction of costs.8.     Shortages of labour.    A shortage of labour within aparticular industry or firm does not of itself warrant an increase,since in a fully employed economy there are bound to be scarcitiesof many kinds of labour. It is only where the building up of man-power in one industry relatively to others, or the prevention of athreatened decline, is plainly necessary that an increase on thosegrounds could be justified. Such a need may be either general orrelated to particular areas or grades.9-      Comparability.    In the past comparisons with levels or trendsof income in other employments have played a large part in discussions leading to wage and salary increases and have beenaccepted as guiding criteria, especially in the public services.These comparisons will still have a part to play.     But at any ratein the immediate future more regard will have to be given to thegeneral economic considerations set out in this paper.    TheGovernment will emphasize the need for this in their negotiationswith their own employees.10.     Lowest-paid workers.     There may be some cases where anincrease could be justified for groups of workers whose rates ofwages have been exceptionally low.     But this should not be allowedto lead to other increases designed merely to restore formerrelativities.     This would not only harm the economy as a wholebxxt by leading to higher prices would deprive those whom it was intended to benefit of much of the real value of the increase.Negotiation and arbitratijon11.     It is for employers and employees to work out the applica-tion of the considerations set out above to individual cases, in thelight of the conditions and agreements existing in particular industries and areas.     The Government ask, however, that allnegotiations affecting wages and salaries in 1962 should reflectthese considerations.     The effectiveness of this approachnecessarily depends heavily on the willingness of workers not to-3-CONFIDENT6AL
press claims which go beyond the limits which this policy indicates.Since wages and salaries are a large proportion of total incomes and since increases in pay do not, in general, come out of profitincomes, a substantial pay increase obtained by one set of workersis ultimately paid for in the main by their fellow workers.     this consideration should have a restraining effect on those who are ina strong bargaining position.     The effectiveness of the proposalsdepends also upon the co-operation of employers and upon their ability to ensure that moderation in collectively-negotiated settle-ments is not fr ustrated in its effects by individual bidding-up of wage and salary rates.    A special responsibility attaches tothose industries in which settlements of wages and salaries mayset a general pattern.     This applies to nationalised industries aswell as to industries in the private sector.     The Government havealready made clear that in respect of the Civil Service theirrepresentatives in negotiation and at arbitration will argue theneed, in the national interest, to keep increases in incomes in proper relationship to increases in national production.12.    In a wide range of employments arrangements exist wherebydifferences which are not settled by negotiation can be referred by agreement to independent arbitration.    Indeed, the possibilityof arbitration is expressly provided for in national agreementscovering about six million employees.     When there is no specific provision on the subject arbitration is used from time to time inother industries and services when the parties agree that it is appropriate.     This peaceful means of settling disputes has been ofundoubted value in avoiding industrial strife and the government attach great importance to the maintenance of arrangements wherebydisputes are referred by agreement to arbitration.     They recognisethat arbitration will only operate effectively if arbitrators continueto exercise, and are seen to exercise, complete independence inmaking their own awards.13.    Arbitrators have at times been critized for dealing only withthe particular case before them as a private issue between thetwo parties concerned.    But in the complex economic situation of the post-war years arbitrators generally have become increasinglyconscious of, and interested in, the wider implications of theirawards.    This, in the Governments view, is of crucial importance.Arbitrators ought therefore to be given an opportunity to considerall the information necessary to put the particular case before themin its proper perspective against the background of wage  movementselsewhere and other factors affecting the national economicsituation.     They must also have an opportunity to hear the viewsof the parties on the application to their case both of this informa-tion and of the general principle that incomes should not increasefaster than national productivity.14.     The Government propose to collect together and to publishin convenient form factual information on wage rates, earnings,hours of work and other conditions of employment, man-power,prices, production, profits and other relevant subjects so that due-4.confidential
weight can be given by all concerned to the considerations set outin this paper at all stages of negotiation and at arbitration.Publication will take place at regular intervals to ensure that up-to-date information will be available at all times.Profits ajidJPiyj^dends15.    Although this paper deals primarily with wages and salaries, the same principles apply, in the Governments view, toall forms of income.     Continued restraint in profits and dividendsis a necessary corollary of the incomes policy outlined above andthe Government re-affirm the request for the co-operation of those responsible made by the Chancellor in the statement on 25th July,1961.    In the debate in the House of Commons on 18th December,1961, the Chancellor said that &quot;as a part of the incomes policy,appropriate corrective action would have to be taken if aggregateprofits showed signs of increasing excessively as compared withwages and salaries&quot;.Conclusion16.     The Government re-affirm that their policy is one ofsecuring economic expansion and growth.     But this can only beachieved if we can introduce a greater element of realism into ourtreatment of incomes.     This more than anything else is the keyto securing a steady improvement in our real standard of life.-5-CONFIDENTIAL
