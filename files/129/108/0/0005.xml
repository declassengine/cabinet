C. (62) 5 &apos;.. Copy No.  554th January, 1962CABINETEDUCATION policy memorandum by the Minister of education the Government are committed to a series of advances in education for mostof which timetables have been announced. We have said we would eliminateoversize classes as first priority, reorganise all-age schools and steadily replaceslum schools, and expand higher education on a great scale.These and other commitments were calculated to require an increase in educational expenditure over the next four years of 4-6 per cent, a year a figure which was compared with the forecast of 2\ per cent, increase a year in the gross domestic Product. In C. (61) 88 I was asked to keep educational expenditure within an increase of 3 per cent, a year. Since this slow-down would involvepostponements of published programmes, at a time when in my judgment we should do more rather than less in education, I could not accept it. It may be useful if themain arguments are drawn together in this paper.Arguments of Political Principle2. The grant of the vote to men and women at the age.of 21 started a racebetween an egalitarian and an opportunity State. Stripped of inessentials the choicebefore the new electors was between a controlled economy in which wealth was muchmore equally distributed irrespective of merit and an open society in whichopportunities for all would be enlarged to a degree that would produce &quot;one nation&quot;with far less class-consciousness. [ .. -. -The standards of public education were bound to become all-important inthis race. Unfortunately the Tory horse had to carry a heavy handicap. Up tothe war British education was in no condition to provide fair and,.wide opportunities for all children. In relation to the introduction of universal suffrage the 1944Education Act was 25 years too late; worse still only in 1956 did we begin -to build a system of technical education remotely adequate for a leading industrial nation;Nevertheless the Education Act was a Conservative measure, and, provided we carry it out with unremitting vigour, it will prove an invaluable and permanent assetto our party. .......Tory Governments since 1951 have therefore been under exceptional pressureso to improve the public system of education that we all become middle-class, speakthe same language and can comprehend the responsibilities of living in a free and fully-employed society.This is happening. But the open question is whether the pace is adequate tothe political necessity. We can take comfort from the fact that the maintainedschools are achieving a fair mix-up within the range of families who send their children to them. The 11-plus exam picks out the clever children and puts them on the ladder to higher education. But it is common knowledge that secondaryand further education for the average child are still far from satisfactory.3. A social division arises between children who go to maintained schools aridchildren who go to fee-paying schools, which are expected to give a privileged startin life. This division is a gift to the Socialists. Our political interest is to see thatthe gap between the two systems is narrowed.   To that end I have said that:60206THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1962 * -
(a) We must improve the maintained schools so that the overlap in educationalstandards will grow at a rate fast enough to take the sting out of the controversy.(b) Parents should choose to send their children to primary schools wherever the education offered is satisfactory.. ,,One effect therefore of a slow-down in the expected rate of improvement (seethe Appendix to my Paper C. (61) 212 which shows how big is the task before usto eliminate oversize classes in primary and secondary schools) in.the maintainedschools would be to cast doubt on our determination to narrow the gap betweenthe two systems. Such action would bring general protests from the Trade UnionCongress and the Labour Party; and from the local authorities responsible for education who are now all converted to expansion in the service. Indeed a newfeature in the last few years has been that Tory-controlled councils are now, if anything, the most enthusiastic. Opposition would also come from the publis schools and the Universities. Their leaders are nervous that the Labour party will destroy the independent schools, and they fully realise the importance of swiftimprovement in the maintained system for the reasons given above.It is hard to point to any important body of opinion in the country, or any single newspaper, which would not oppose a slow-down in the rate of educationaladvance. The political results of doing so would be serious and. the contradictionwith a policy of opportunity and growth obvious.Economic Arguments4. Since the war the nature of public education as an element in national policy has undergone a radical re-assessment. Education for the masses used tobe bracketed with other articles of consumption, like better housing, food and clothing, and higher Old Age Pensions-all benefits to be progressively increased as a country became richer. But recently the pace of change has been so quickened&quot;by science and technology that education is more often thought of as an article ofproduction rather than as an article-of consumption. Economists are now studying,the relation between the expenditure on education and the rate of economic growth,with conclusions pointing to education as a form of public investment which gives a very high return.The British employer is becoming converted to this view. His demands, growevery year for better educated entrants to all occupations. He is. discovering, that industry needs more than a few top-level experts; these men require to be supportedby technicians and sub-professional grades in far greater numbers, than we haveto-day. As the President of the Board of Trade will confirm, the prospect of entry into the Common Market has much accelerated the demand for. better educationat the technical level, which is itself dependent on better education in the schools.If then we slow down the rate of educational advance, we shallbe going counter to one of the clearest and loudest demands of British industry.Income-Policy Arguments.5. Figures given by the Treasury show- that increases in incomes in excess ofwhat we have earned have been the major cause of the stop and go in the economysince the war. The two sides of industry and the country in general are now being asked to accept a. reduction in the annual increase in incomes to about half whatthey have become accustomed to expect. In this policy compulsion is ruled out.We are bound therefore carefully to consider whether what we do in other directionswill help or hinder consent to income restraint.I believe the majority of the electors would accept cuts provided:(a) They were fairly distributed between one income: group and another.(b) They were seen to be part of a design to release greater resources for production either in the public sector or in the private-sector.Electoral Considerations6. We have had in the last ten years two domestic priorities of which thecountry was proud and from which the party.derived much benefit: 300,000 houses;and the civil use of nuclear energy.  To-day we have no obvious priority.   the confidential
message is restraint all round. It may be said that the balance of payments has tobe our priority, but this has little appeal for the working man and his family.Growth would be a sound and attractive priority. But growth is one of thoseomnibus words like duty, which does not mean much unless a man knows whereand how it is to be achieved. If growth were to catch on it would have to be illustrated by manifest choices in policy in the cuts and increases in public expenditure, in taxation and investment and so on.We know from experience that in campaigns to arouse public support for anew line of action it is necessary:(a) To be consistent.(b) To plug a very short list of outstanding examples to create the desiredI fear that some of the measures now proposed are inconsistent with a growth-cum-incomes policy, but be that as it may, I submit that public education is themost telling priority we have, the best banner for a growth policy, to collect thesupport of the largest number (all the mothers) to take less to-day in order to enjoymore tomorrow.There is a further argument for such a choice. People are disturbed aboutstandards of behaviour and are looking round for ways to reverse what appears tobe a progressive decline. The home and the schools interact in the formation ofcharacter. When one is weak the other has a greater responsibility. To-day it is widely held that parental discipline is slack and that everything possible should bedone to help the schools to take the strain.7. In my view the political, social and economic arguments all point to the wisdom of doing more rather than less to improve the system of public education.image.D.
