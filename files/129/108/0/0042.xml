HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C, (62) 4227th February, 1962COPY NO.CABINETNORTHERN RHODESIA - constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColoniesWhile it is, of course, a matter of judgment, I do notconsider that the abolition of the numerical alternative alone, .whether the hurdle be IZj per cent or even 10 per cent, will besufficient to obtain African acquiescence in the Constitution.I should like to deal with the Asian seat in the following terms: -&quot;The June proposals altered the qualifications for voting in the National seats by transferring the Asian votersto a special seat, and at the same time the Upper Roll was extended by the addition of some 500 African voters.     the asian seat has been the subject of much controversy and.itsabolition has been demanded by Asians and by Africans.    Inthese circumstances I propose to revert to the Februaryproposals in these matters which would entail the abolition ofthe Asian seat as I believe that this would be more consistent with the general principles of the National seats. 11R.M.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.26th February, 1962.
