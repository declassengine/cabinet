OXFORD ROADSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIt is now a matter of urgency that a decision should be reached on Oxfordroads. The Home Affairs Committee on 21st February considered a memorandumby the Ministers of Housing and Local Government and Transport; a copy is annexed. For the convenience of the Cabinet the views of the Committee are summarised in the paragraphs below.2. What is required is a decision in principle on whether there should be a road through Christ Church Meadow, as proposed by Oxford City Council, ora road on a line further south, as proposed by the Oxford Preservation Trust.It is the firm view of the two Ministers concerned that one road or the other mustbe built in order to restore as much peace as possible to the University area andto relieve the traffic problem in the area of the High and Carfax. The decisionturns on whether the damage which would be done to amenity by a road acrossthe Meadow would outweigh the greater traffic efficiency which that road would secure. As indicated in paragraph 16 of the Annex, the cost considerations cannot in themselves be regarded as decisive.3. The two Ministers would prefer the road across the Meadow to the longerroute and most members of the Committee were disposed to accept this view.But the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance and the Minister of works were not satisfied that any new road was required. They suggested that completionof the system of outer by-passes might have a greater effect than was being allowed for in relieving congestion in the centre and thought that their effect could be supplemented if necessary by imposing restrictions on the use of Magdalen Bridge.The value of preserving the peace of the Meadow should in their view be put very high indeed and if one road or the other had to be built the longer route shouldbe chosen: it would not damage amenity and would be free of possible difficulties over flooding.4. The rest of the Committee felt no serious doubt about the need for a newroad. The effect of the by-passes cannot be great because the main traffic troubledoes not arise from people wishing to get from one side of the city to another but from people wishing to get to the centre. Restrictions of greater or less severitymight be needed if either of the proposed roads were built. Those required toensure effective use of the longer route would affect both ends of the High andtheir severity would make them most unpalatable to the city. On amenity, it waspointed out that the line of the Meadow road as now proposed would be over a quarter of a mile from Christ Church and would not be open to the same objectionsas the line suggested several years ago. The road could be built in a cutting and,although this would be expensive, the increased cost would still fall short of thecost of the longer route. One member of the Committee said that the Meadowin its present condition was unsightly and that its appearance might well be improved by the landscaping which a road would entail and by the higher standardof maintenance on adjoining land which would then be called for. Effectivelandscaping would also help to reduce noise.60491Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1962C. (62) 37 Copy No.      5028th February, 1962CABINET
5. The Committee took note of a further point, which was made on behalfof the Lord President of the Council. It is evident that a road across the Meadowwould be regarded in the House of Lords as desecration and that there would bethe utmost difficulty in securing Lords approval for an Order, if an Order proved to be necessary, authorising; the construction of such a road.6. I have no alternative but to summarise the conclusion that a substantial^majority favoured the Meadow road.*f&quot; . R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,28th February, 1962.ANNEXOXFORD ROADSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh Affairs and the Minister of transport the Oxford roads question has now, after many vicissitudes, reached thepoint of decision. The Government have accepted responsibility for making thedecision and decide now we must. Until this is settled the City Council will find it increasingly difficult to deal with many of the planning applications which cometo them, and in particular they cannot themselves get on with the much overdueredevelopment of St. Ebbe&apos;s.2. At the request of the Council my predecessor held an enquiry at large in December 1960, at which anybody was free to offer any solution of the Oxfordtraffic problem. The enquiry was taken by Sir Frederick Armer and his report has been published.  It was debated in the House of Lords on 26th June, 1961.3. The report has been examined by our two Departments in the light ofall the information produced at the enquiry and also of the views expressed in the debate in the House of Lords.The Issue4. It is common ground that two things are needed. One is to restore asmuch peace as possible to the University area by relieving it of traffic. A complete&quot; precinct&quot; is not practicable; but if the traffic using the High could be greatly reduced the gain to the University would be enormous. The other is to solveso far as possible the Oxford traffic problem; some alternative to the hopelesslycongested road system revolving round Carfax would be needed even if this werenot a University city.5. Both purposes entail the construction of a road to relieve MagdalenBridge, the High, Carfax and the Cornmarket; together with the provision of adequate car parks as close to the centre as possible. Relief will not be achievedmerely by the outer by-passes, already almost complete. The City Council have carried out a traffic survey, which has been analysed by the Road research laboratory (report published in 1959). The analysis shows that completion ofthe outer by-passes cannot be expected to relieve the central area by more than15 per cent.
6. Two dozen schemes of one kind or another were ventilated at the public enquiry. We are clear, basing ourselves on the results of the traffic survey, that only two of these are worth considering: ,(i) One is a road crossing the middle of Christ Church Meadow, bridgedover the Cherwell just south-west of St. Hilda&apos;s and under-passingSt. Aldate&apos;s into St. Ebbe&apos;s. This was proposed at the enquiry by theCouncil and is the scheme recommended by the Inspector.(ii) The other is a road south of the Meadow, crossing the Isis just below itsjunction with the Cherwell, coming to a roundabout junction with theAbingdon road and so up that road (widened) into St. Ebbe&apos;s by asecond bridge just west of Folly Bridge. A road south of the Meadowwas proposed at the enquiry by the Oxford Preservation Trust and was supported in its essentials by the University and most of the Collegeswhich expressed an interest.7. A large scale map showing both lines is available; and a copy can beprovided for any Minister who wants one.8. West of St. Aldate&apos;s through St. Ebbe&apos;s and away north the two routesmerge and provide for car parks convenient to the Cornmarket. We do not thinkthat this part is open to serious argument at this stage. The precise line of thewhole route will be the subject of a further enquiry at which detailed objectionswill be heard. The issue of principle which we have to put to our colleagues isthe choice for the first part of the route between (i) a direct road across the Meadow(ii) a longer road to the south of it.The Arguments9. There is no doubt at all that the direct road would be the better solutionjudged solely on traffic considerations. Being shorter and more direct it wouldbe much more attractive to traffic. In order to make the southern line at allcomparable it would be necessary to compel traffic to use it, by closing theHeadington and Cowley roads and / or Magdalen Bridge, to everything except busesand bicycles.10. The evidence from the Road Research Laboratory, which was not shakenat the enquiry, was that the direct route across the Meadow would effect a majorrelief to the central area without any road closure. Their estimate was that withthis road the flow in the University area would in 15 years&apos; time, even with theincrease in total traffic expected, still be at the level of the 1930s. Of course itwould still be possible to close Magdalen Bridge to most traffic under this scheme,and so increase its effectiveness. Indeed it would be easier to do so under thisscheme since the alternative would be shorter.11. The longer route could be expected to bring relatively little relief to theUniversity area unless the approach roads and/or the Bridge were closed.12. The City Council have always opposed the closing of the Bridge, andwould almost certainly oppose the closing of the approach roads, which would cutoff a substantial section of the community in St. Clements. So that if we decidedfor the longer route south of the Meadow we might have difficulty in making iteffective.13. The longer route would also entail more demolition of sound property in St. Clements.14. The objection to the direct route is, of course, the effect on the Meadow.It was this more than anything else which led Members of the House of Lords toattack the Armer report in the June debate. If we decided to approve this routethe House of Lords would almost certainly register violent disapproval.15. The question we have to decide is whether the damage to the Meadow ofa road crossing it would be so serious that we must go for the longer and less efficient alternative. The line proposed would be over a quarter of a mile distantfrom the Colleges backing on to the Meadow, and they should not be seriously affected. The paths, including the Long Walk, would be kept with nearly all thetrees and the road itself could be screened by trees and bushes. It might indeed be sunk so that the traffic would not be visible except where the road had to rise to cross the Cherwell. That would reduce the noise as well as the effect on the whole
appearance of the Meadow. It would greatly add to the cost since this is floodplain; but even so the road Would cost less than the longer route and we would beprepared to defend the additional cost entailed in sinking the road if, on more detailed examination, it seemed a feasible and worthwhile plan. But however theroad is designed it must cut the Meadow in half and change its character.16, As between the two schemes cost should not, we think, be regarded as a decisive factor. The whole of the direct route, including the part across St. Ebbe&apos;sand away north, would cost about  2  million if the road crossed the Meadow atground level; about  3  million if it were sunk as we must be prepared to contemplate if we go for this route. The. longer route would cost about  4 million.17. The City Council will be bitterly disappointed if we cannot bring ourselves to face a road across the Meadow. After long heart-searching they did so, acceptingwhat seemed to them the conclusive evidence from the traffic survey. They put their view to the test of the enquiry and of any alternative anybody could propose;and the Inspector concluded that they were right. It is they who have to carry through whatever scheme we decide is the right one; and although they can beexpected to accept whatever decision we reach, they will have little heart for the longer route.Conclusion18. The question is whether we decide for the more efficient traffic routecrossing the Meadow; or whether we think that the damage to the Meadow of anyroad crossing it, however carefully designed and screened (or if appropriate sunk)is more than we can face. This is anybody&apos;s view. On traffic grounds alone theMinister of Transport has no doubt that the Meadow road is the right answer.Together we would be prepared to announce and defend a road across the Meadowif our colleagues will face it; but if not we will defend the longer route. All we askis that we should now decide firmly for one or the other in principle; the detailedline, including the question of sinking the road if we decide for the Meadow route,to be settled after further examination with the City Council and the final enquiry which has to be held.C. H.E. M.6th February, 1962.
