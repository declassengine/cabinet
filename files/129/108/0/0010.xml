DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)C. (62) 10 COPY NO.12th. January, 1962CABINETPAY POLICY FOR. THE. PUBLIC services during THE 1&apos; INT ERME^IAXE^ERIODA&apos;Memorandum by the Chief Secreta^y^ to^IieTreasury and Paymaster general in the paper sent to the Chairman of the Economic Committeeof the Trades Union Congress (C. (62) 7), the Chancellor of the exchequer has outlined his proposals for a policy on wages and salaries to befollowed during the period after the end of the pay pause and before theintroduction of a long-term policy on personal incomes.2.      On the assumption that a policy of this general character on wages and salaries will go forward after the end of the present financialyear, the Government must decide how it shall be applied in the public services for which it is directly responsible.   Urgent decisions are needed on this because: -(a) The Trades Union Congress are certain to ask the directquestion:   several public service trade unions and staff associationsare affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, and the General Secretaryof one of the most important of the Civil Service Associations (theUnion of Post Office Workers) in on the Economic Committee itself:moreover, some of the general unions with powerful voices in theTrades Union Congress (e. g. , the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union) represent industrial grades in the Civil Service and have been particularly vocal in their complaints, in particular about the M Rate.(b) I have to meet the Civil Service representatives on&apos;l&apos;6thJanuax&apos;y or soon after, in accordance with an undertaking given by theChancellor on 18th December, to discuss how Civil Service pay shallbe handled during the interim period;  the &quot;go slow&quot; of the Civil ServiceClerical Association is to start on 17th January, and there may well be advantage in holding this meeting before then.3,.     The public service employments likely to be most immediately concerned in the application of any new policy in the first half of 1962,are:-(a)       CjyiJjS ervice, non-industrial and industrial - There is a generalclaim for a central pay settlement (about 4 per cent) in the non-industrial Civil Service, excluding Post Office grades.   The Union of post Office Workers has an interim claim of a similar amount, whichhas been rejected on merits and is the cause of the present &quot;work to rule&quot;;  but the Postmaster General has made clear his willingness tonegotiate with the Union of Post Office Workers on the Pay ResearchUnit survey after it has been received in the spring.   There are claims-1-SESRET
for an additional 3 per cent on quite different grounds for the Sub-Clerical and Clerical classes, and for the Executive Officers.     Inthe industrial Civil Service there is the M Rate and a major claim for improvements in the engineering or E Rate to conform with earnings in the engineering industry.   (There is provision for compulsory arbitration in the Civil Service).(b) Armed Forces - In accordance with the recommendationsof the Advisory Committee on Recruiting under the chairmanship ofS;1r James Grigg (Cmnd. 545), the second two-year review of the pay of the forces by reference to industrial earnings in the case of other ranks, and Civil Service Executive pay in the case of officers, is nowunder way and increases would normally bcannouneed  during February,to take effect on 1st April.   The review seems likely to point to in-creases substantially greater than Z\ per cent.   (There is noarbitration here.)(c) Nurses - The claim is for a 33 per cent increase.   TheMinister of Education states that an &quot;economic&quot; increase wouldbe of the order of 5 per cent;   and increase related to the pay of non-graduate teachers would be about 11 per cent.   (There is provisionfor arbitration by consent, but the Minister is not bound to acceptawards.)(d) University teachers - The University Grants Committee,who are the Governments official adviers here, have submittedrecommendations that would amount to a 17 per cent increase .   (Thereis no provision for arbitration. )There  is also an important claim on behalf of local authoritysalaried staff, which is paralleled for similar staff in the electricity and gas industries and would undoubtedly be affected by pay policyin the services for which the Government are directly responsible.4.      In the case of the Civil Service the points to which the staffassociation leaders attach most importance and which they will undoubtedly raise with me next week are:-(a) Are the Government prepared to restore in full recourse to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal and the Industrial Court?(b) Is fair comparison with comparable work outside the CivilService to continue to be the basis for determining pay?Arbitration5.      The right course, in my view, would be to restore in thepublic services the rights to arbitration as they existed before the pay pause (not however permitting any backdating into the present financial year) but to let it be known that management sides will argueas strongly as possible in negotiation and in arbitration courts onthe basis of the case put by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to theTrades Union Congress that increases in incomes during 1962 ought notto exceed the anticipated increase in production.   This is surely the onecourse which has a reasonable chance of acceptance by the public
service unions.   The Government are bound to restore arbitration infull in the public services, if there is to be any hope of the TradesUnion Congress coming to any sort of agreement with the chancellor on the general policy.   Of course, if such agreement were reached,it would give representatives of management a more powerful card to persuade arbitrators to have regard to the national interest than theyever had before.6.      The alternatives to the above course for the public service are:-(a) To withdraw the right of arbitration altogether.(b) To say that we would refuse to implement an arbitration awardthat was in excess of, say, Z\ per cent.(c) To implement arbitration awards up to Z\ per cent, but tohold over until the end of the intermediate period any part of an awardin excess of 2j per cent.Any of these courses would, in my judgment, stand no chance of acceptance by the staff associations or the unions.   The first two would,indeed, represent more severe restrictions to arbitration than wasapplied during the pause itself.   The third would store up freshdifficulties for the Government, because it would pile up increases forthe end of the intermediate period and make the transition to the long-term policy that much more difficult.7&apos;    Easement in rates unimproved for two or three years -Assuming that there is available a  global  sum which would permit increases of the order of ?.\ per cent, a decision is needed on whether increases in the public services should, where a case for increase is successfully made out, be strictly limited to a flat rate o  Z\ per cent however long or short the period since thelast pay review.   The Chancellors letter to the Trades Union   Congressaccepted that there would be exceptional cases where claims for increases above the norm could be sustained, as well as cases whereindustries could afford no increases at all.   The Civil Service generallyhad its last pay increase twelve months ago, but if we made no pro-   &apos;-vision for easement in cases where a scale of pay has been unchangedfor a considerable time longer than that, we would find ourselvesstruggling to defend manifestly inequitable outcomes, and might exposeourselves to the charge of completely ignoring the principle of &quot;faircomparison&quot; to which the Government are at present committed in this field.8.      If my colleagues will let me know their reactions to the pointsdiscussed in paragraphs 5-7 above, 1 will be guided thereby when Imeet the Staff Side representatives.H. E.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.12th January, 1962-3-. SEGFSET
