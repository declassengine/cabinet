C. (62) 17 Copy No.  5523rd January, 1962CABINETWHALING IN SOUTH GEORGIAMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial AffairsTwo whaling stations have until now operated from the island of SouthGeorgia in the Falkland Islands Dependencies. The smaller one, at Grytviken,is run by a company named Albion Star, with mainly Norwegian crews andregistered in the Dependencies: the other, and much larger concern, at LeithHarbour, by Salvesen&apos;s, a Scottish firm.2. Salvesen&apos;s have made losses in recent years and have decided not to operate this season. They have received a bid from a Japanese company to takeover their installations at Leith Harbour which in its turn depends on the transferof the lease of the land which needs the approval of the Governor of the Falklands.They want to accept this bid, which they imply is for &quot; around a million pounds &quot;.3. If it is carried through it will mean that South Georgia will have as itsresident population, apart from the Administrative Officer and his staff of oneor two, one which is entirely, or likely to be entirely, Japanese since the smallercompany would almost certainly have to change to Japanese crews to compete,or close down.4. Objections have been raised by the Governor and others. The Governorfor his part is fearful that, while initially the Japanese company would co-operate,in time they would have less and less regard for our administration which is run ona shoe-string and is dependent on good relations between the AdministrativeOfficer and the Whaling Company and the provision of facilities by the latter forhis administration to get about. He therefore is not keen that the deal should go through. The Foreign Office are not anxious to see the question of the FalklandIsland Dependencies further complicated by having all or the majority of thepopulation on South Georgia Japanese. The Ministry of Defence do not considerthat defence arguments need prevail, and the Scottish Office and the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, see no reason to oppose it.5. I see the force of the objections and I feel no enthusiasm for seeing SouthGeorgia peopled entirely with Japanese. But at the same time it seems to me verydifficult for the Government to veto what is essentially a commercial transaction.Should we do this, I would expect criticism in Parliament both from ScottishMembers who support Salvesen&apos;s and from free traders and internationalistsgenerally. There might also be complications in the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade and representations from the Japanese Government. Moreover,we might well have to face a claim for heavy compensation from Salvesen&apos;s.6. On balance I believe that, providing the Japanese company are preparedto meet our extra administrative costs (i.e., a launch and crew and possibly aGovernment sub-station) we should not stop the deal.P.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,23rd January, 1962.60315Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1962
