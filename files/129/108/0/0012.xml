C. (62) 1215th January, 1962COPY NO.CABINETVIS rr._TO_WEjST._B ERJ-iINMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs my colleagues may be interested to have the following notes on the main impressions which I derived from my one-day visit to west berlin on 10th January,(a) The WallThe wall dividing West Berlin from the Eastern sector of thecity is ugly both physically and morally,   W th the addition ox tankobstacles, barbed wire, ditches, etc, behind it, it has now. become an almost impenetrable obstacle to unauthorised passage.   I was almostmore impressed, however, by the zonal border between West berlin and East Germany,   This has been closed and wired since 1952, but theEastern defences have been greatly strengthened since last August.Here the Communists have now created what is certainly meant to bea permanent frontier with elaborate barbed wire entanglements, astretch of ploughed land and well constructed observation towersevery 100 yards or so.   This is on the pattern of the 800 mile zonalborder between East and West Germany and, I believe, other frontiers of Communist States.   It is clear that all this ie intended to bring aboutthe lasting division of Germany, with an isolated West Berlin, until such time as the whole country is ripe to go communist. &apos;\(b) Morale of the PopulationThe Vfest Berliners seem to be recovering from the initialshock of the events of last August.   Figures for industrial production,trade, investment, etc. , have begvin to move upwards.   The initialtendency for people to leave the city for the Federal Republic is nowless marked, and the net loss of population is now just over 3, 000 a month.There has been a quite considerable inflow of skilled workers intoWest Berlin to replace workers from East Berlin who can no longercross the sector boundary.   Barge firms in West Berlin have been thebest able to adjust themselves to the new conditions by rationalising their labour force and bringing  in new labovir from West Germany; smallerfirms and businesses have been worse hit by the loss of manpower andare more affected by the uncertainty as to the future.   The cruellestaspect of the wall is the separation of families and friends and thisaffects a very large percentage of the West Berlin population.   But apart-1-SECSKET
from this I heard little grumbling.   I heard nothing to suggest that thepopulation^ morale (as General Clay, President Kennedy&apos;s personal representative, seems to think) needs to be boosted by adventurous orprovocative actions on the part of the Western Powers in relation tomovement in East Berlin.   The West Berliners seem to be getting downto the task of making the best of their situation.   West Berlin is not atpresent at any rate withering on the vine.(c) The need for Sectxrity and ContinuityThere is, however, an obvious need for reassurance about future security and continuity of conditions.   Free access to West germany is absolutely essential if the life of the city is to be maintained and ifthis is once believed to be in jeopardy, morale would undoubtedlycollapse.   From this 1 conclude that the basis on which v/e are trying tofind means of negotiation   with the Russians is the right one.   That isto say, to reach a modus vivendi which would ensure guaranteed continuityto present access facilities.   So far as the West Berliners are concerned,this is the vital question.   They hate the East German regime and wouldbe shocked if the West recognised it de jure.   But they would not be upsetby more de facto recognition if it meant safer access.(d) Herr BrandtThe Mayor of West Berlin, Herr Brandt, typifies andreflects this relatively calm and rational attitude of the inhabitantsand I have no doubt that he is largely responsible for the high state ofmorale.   His main concern, after the maintenance of the economic life of the city, is to obtain alleviation of the human suffering caused by the wall.   He is fully in agreement with the effort of the United States and theUnited Kingdom to seek a negotiation on free access and he is ready tomake more concessions in the direction of dealings with the DeutscheDemokratische Republik than the Federal Government have so far seemedready for.   Fox* example, he would see no objection to the East GermanGovernment being represented on an international access control authority.Once fi-ee access were assured he would be willing to enter into dis-cussion with the East German   authorities in order to arrange some formof controlled movement of persons across the sector border.   He thinksit should be possible to agree upon some system which would satisfy theEast Germans   that individuals who came over to visit relatives, etc.would return and he would give every possible undertaking to this effectshort of returning such persons by force.   He has in mind a trial run ofa few weeks to see whether such a system wotild work.   Herr Brandt doesnot think, however, that any approach should be made to the East Germanson these subjects until the outcome of the Moscow probe is clearer.(e) ^^ZJiayi d^ela^ons^I formed a very favourable impression of the judgment and goodsense of the British Commandant, General Delacombe, and I think that theBritish military and civilian authorities are in good shape.   Unfortunatelythere has been serious deterioration in inter-allied co-operation sincethe advent of General Clay.   Before he came, the three Commandantstook all their decisions after full consultation with each other.    Now, the-2-II EGRET
United States Commandant, General Watson, cannot speak authoritativelywith his colleagues and decisions which affect the interests of all threeAllies are all too often taken unilaterally by General Clay.   General Claybelieves in a policy of toughness towards the Russians and the EastGermans and is impatient of restraint whether it be from the state department or from Ms British and French Allies.   The other americans in Berlin appear to be critical of his policies.   This is a dangerous situation ^fcdch I am asking H.M. Ambassador in Washington to take up with the United States Government.(f) G-onjclusj-on my visit has made me rather more hopeful about the prospects of reaching some modus vivendi with the Russians over Berlin.   It seemsto me that they have already obtained the essential element in what they want by building the wall and thus preventing the disintegration of east Germany and that West Berlin, since 13th August, is no longer thethorn in their side that it was.   One cannot be dogmatic   about this yet,because the situation inside East Germany is still very bad from thecommunist point of view both economically and politically.   But, ifEast Germany becomes more of a going concern in the months ahead,and if a reasonably iviable way of life can be found for West Berlin,there is no reason why the two sides could not agree to leave the cityas it is, with Western protection and access guaranteed on a basis which would not do violence to the authority of East Germany.H.Foreign Office, S.Yf.1.15th January, 19623-
