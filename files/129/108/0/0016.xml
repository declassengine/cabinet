Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1962C. (62) 16 Copy No.   5722nd January, 1962CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster general it may be convenient to the Cabinet if I gather together in one short paper themain facts and issues which now face us on Public Expenditure.The 1961-62 Outturn2. The Supplementary Estimates so far presented total  144 million. Wehave shortly to present another batch of over  100 million. Allowing for somesavings, the net outturn for 1961-62 now seems likely to be about  5,400 million,some  210 million above the Budget Estimates ( 5,187 million).The 1962-63 Estimates3. The 1962-63 Estimates, at  5,610 million, show a rise of  423 million onthe Budget Estimates for 1961-62. This rise, amounting to over 8 per cent., willbe very badly received at home and abroad.The 2\ per cent. Pledge4. It is true that, of the rise of  423 million,  40 million is due to a technicalbook-keeping alteration necessitated by the new form of Estimates, and  139 million to increases in pay and prices. But that still leaves a gap of  244 million, whichwe need to reduce to  134 million to fulfil the 2\ per cent, pledge by the Chancellorof the Exchequer. If we cannot reduce that  244 million we shall have^o explain,when the Vote on Account is published at the end of February, why we arebudgeting for an increase in real terms of 4  per cent, and not 2\ per cent., as parliament and the International Monetary Fund authorities have been led to expect.5. Towards the  110 million economies needed, the only proposals in vieware for saving  20^ million on welfare milk and  17 million on school meals. If wedo both these, we shall still be  72 million short of our target; we shall bebudgeting for an increase in real terms of between 3f per cent, and 4 per cent.Necessity for Long-term Policy Decisions6. Will not those who are watching our performance critically draw theconclusion that our efforts to control the growth of expenditure are ineffective?The only means available to rebut such criticism will be by showing unmistakablythat, even though we have not managed to keep the 1962-63 Estimates down,nevertheless we have taken firm long-term policy decisions for restricting the60304
future growth of expenditure. The present position in each principal field isas follows:(a) Defence. The Defence Committee have endorsed proposals for strategyin the 1960s which are stated to cost  1,810 million in 1965^-66 on theunderstanding that the Minister would endeavour to reduce this amount to  1,787 million (the figure laid down in the Prime Minister^directive), by securing further economies in manpower, in the use of nuclear material for defence purposes and in research and development expenditure.(b) Roads. A five-year plan has been agreed and announced, at levels agood way short of what the Minister of Transport would have liked.(c) Health. The Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotlandhave agreed to keep the annual rate of growth of current expenditurein the National Health Service within 2% per cent.(d) Education. The Minister of Education desires a rate of growth of localauthorities&apos; current expenditure of 4&apos;i per cent, per annum or more.I am sure that we cannot fit in so high a figure. To obtain a materialreduction we must slow down the rate of increase of educationalinvestment on the lines I have suggested.(e) Housing. The Minister of Housing wishes for a considerably larger increase in council house building from 1963 onwards than I think weare in a position to authorise.(/) Agriculture. Until the present system of price support is altered we havea dangerous open-ended commitment.(g) Nationalised Industries. The deficit of the railways is not yet under control.  It is likely to be  150 million in the current year and morethan that in 1962-63.   The outlook for the National Coal Board is better but still very uncertain.7. There is the opportunity now to take firm decisions on a number of thematters indicated above. If we do not do so, I am unable to see how we canrestore confidence in the soundness of our economic policies sufficiently td get usthrough the next few months.We are not out of danger8. This restoration of confidence, based upon a joint policy of restraint in incomes and firm decisions on Government expenditure, is essential as the starting point for a policy of long-term growth, which must surely be our aim. We havenot yet extricated ourselves from the immediate dangers. We must not imperilour chances of doing so by committing ourselves here and now to generous decisions on long-term programmes which, at the moment, there is no evidence that weshall be able to carry through without fresh crises.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1962.
