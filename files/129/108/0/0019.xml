C. (62) 19 Copy No.   g g29th January, 1962CABINETKRUPP DECONCENTRATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Bonn Settlement Convention (which entered into force in May 1955)obliged the Federal German Government to ensure the completion of measuresinitiated by the Occupying Powers for the deconcentration of the german coal-mining and iron and steel industries. The Krupp deconcentration is theonly uncompleted one; and it has become clear that the prospect of a sale ofthe shares concerned is virtually nil. In the circumstances, there seems to be no alternative but for the ex-occupying Powers to agree to relieve the Federal GermanGovernment of their obligation under the Bonn Convention. I recognise thatsuch a step will be very unwelcome to the public and to Parliament and I am therefore seeking the approval of my colleagues before informing the United Statesand French Governments of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude to this problem.2. A summary of the history and main features of the Krupp DeconcentrationPlan, promulgated in March 1953, is contained in the Government statements of15th October, 1952, and 4th March, 1953, reproduced in the Annex to this paper.In accordance with the Plan, assets to the value of about  12 million at the times of disposal have been sold or ceded by Herr Krupp. The shares remaining to be sold are those of the Rheinhausen company, an integrated coal and steel enterprisewhose present-day sale value would be well over  100 million. (These coal andsteel interests in 1960 accounted for less than half of the total turnover of all theKrupp enterprises.)3. The prospects of carrying through this enforced sale of the Krupp coal and steel interests became doubtful at a quite early stage. At the Paris Four-power conference in October 1954, at which the Bonn Conventions took their final form,Dr. Adenauer made a reservation (not published at the time) in which he anticipatedthat difficulties would arise in carrying out the Federal Governmentsdeconcentration obligations, and reserved the right in that event to reopen thematter. Also, when the Federal Parliament examined the deconcentrationprovisions of the Settlement Convention, it made clear that it would be beyondthe constitutional powers of their Government to enforce a sale of shares upon an unwilling owner. As early as February 1957 Dr. Adenauer wrote to ask theThree Powers not to continue with an arrangement which involved great political difficulty for the Federal German Government. By the end of 1958, after a long delay because of French reluctance, the Three Powers had come to the point of agreeing to waive further fulfilment of the Federal Governments obligation; butit was decided at the last moment, because of the political inopportuneness of thedecision for Her Majesty&apos;s Government, to postpone a final decision and to gaintime by setting up the Mixed Committee of independent experts provided forin the Convention. According to the terms of the Convention the Committee(consisting of three Allied and three German members with a neutral SwissChairman) have the power, if they are satisfied that no reasonable offers have beenmade, to extend the original time-limits for the sale of shares. Since 1959 theyhave granted successive annual extensions of time for the sale of the Krupp shares,the latest annual extension running to 31st January, 1962. The Committee meton 10th January to consider Herr Krupp&apos;s request for a further annual extension.They decided, since they considered that Herr Krupp had not given adequatereasons for his request, only to grant an extension till 31st July. But they will meet again in June and will then doubtless agree that the time-limit should be extendedto 31st January, 1963.60325aPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1962 &apos; .
4. In 1960, the Committee reported to the four Governments on.their work upto that time. This report was made at our own instance, with a view to its eventualusefulness in supporting a decision that the Krupp deconcentration could not becarried through; but the report has not yet been published, and though it containssome useful material, it might raise more questions.than it would answer. It wasnot.within the terms of reference of the Committee to make any recommendations.$v]policy ; but in their report it observed, justly enough, that there was no final solution in sight to the Krupp problem, that the method of granting successiveextensions of time offered no prospect of reaching a final, solution, and that renewedconsultation and agreement between the Governments concerned appearednecessary. After the Committee&apos;s report we began, as we promised the federal german Foreign Minister eighteen months ago, to consider again a final decisionto release the Federal Government from their obligation.5. I believe that it would be increasingly difficult, as well as undesirable, tocontinue, with the aid of the Mixed Committee (which is already a transparentdevice for postponement of the issue), to keep alive, and pay lip-service to, an obligation on the Federal Government which they have neither the will nor thepower to carry out. Equally, it would be an undesirable precedent simply to let this obligation become a dead letter. The only way out seems to be a formal exchangeof notes with the Federal Government releasing them, in proper legal form, fromtheir obligation under the Convention. It is expected that the United StatesGovernment will be ready to join in this at any time. The French Government (andparticularly the French Prime Minister, M. Debre) have been reluctant to do thisuntil they were satisfied on the score of future reconcentration in the German steelindustry; but they seem now to think that recent decisions of the High Authorityof the European Coal and Steel Community have given them enough reassuranceto cope with their Parliamentary critics (who are not so much concerned as ourswith Krupps in itself). In these circumstances, given the attitude of the otherGovernments concerned, I think the decision will have to be faced in the course of1962. I have considered whether we could not extract some quid pro quo for thisdecision from the Federal Government, but I have not been able to find any Germanconcession to which our own concession (which amounts to no more thanrecognising the inevitable) could be tied.6. The decision is indeed an unpalatable one, and the Government could notpretend otherwise or try to whitewash Herr Krupp. Nevertheless, in so far asreason can avail against prejudice, there are the following arguments that couldbe used to defend the decision:(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government have not the powers themselves to enforcethis deconcentration; and they have to take account of the position ofthe other Governments concerned.(b) It can be repeated that the Krupp Deconcentration Plan itself had to be negotiated within the framework of decisions taken by the labour government, particularly on Herr Krupp&apos;s trial as a war criminal(which was left to the United States authorities) and on providing that persons compelled to dispose of coal and steel interests under thedeconcentration programme should receive the proceeds of sale.(c) It has become clear enough (as attested by the Mixed Committee) that,if only because of the very great and growing value of Rheiuhausen,there is no reasonable prospect of a sale of the shares.(d) We have maintained the obligation in force as long as we reasonablycould. It is almost five years since the Federal Government first askedto be released from the obligation; instead of accepting their request in1957, we had the Mixed Committee established in order to make sure whether Rheinhausen could not be sold. This is now clear.(e) In the circumstances of to-day, and taking account of the changes in the relationship between the Federal Government and the Three formerOccupying Powers since 1954, the Three Powers could not expect torenegotiate the agreements on deconcentration in order to enforce asale of the Krupp coal and steel interests on terms less favourable to herr Krupp than those originally agreed. Nor could the Three Powersrequire the Federal Government to-day to carry through a sale ofthe shares by means not envisaged in the agreements (e.g., throughnationalisation).
(/) Since the agreements on deconcentration were concluded&apos;it has become clear that the High Authority of the European Coal and steel community (E.C.S.C.) is fully capable of exercising its powers in respectof concentrations. Recent decisions have shown this. It was alwaysintended that future concentrations in the German coal and steel industries should be left to be governed by the E.C.S.C. Treaty, andthe Bonn Conventions accordingly contained no provisions againstreconcentration. In January 1959 the High Authority (withoutprejudice to the Allied deconcentration measures) gave approval forHerr Krupp&apos;s Rheinhausen concern to acquire a majority share-holding in another steel enterprise, but made this approval subject to specialcontrol, which Herr Krupp accepted, of future steel investments bythe Krupp group. This is the modern way in which the originalintentions of the Allied deconcentration programme should be safeguarded.(g) The  Krupp  Deconcentration  Plan  has  nothing  to  do  with  armsmanufacture and imposes no restrictions in that respect. Germanmanufacture of arms generally is controlled by the Brussels Treaty.Herr Krupp is not engaged in arms manufacture and has stated thathe has no intention of manufacturing arms.(h) If Rheinhausen were sold, Herr Krupp would be free to reinvest the proceeds anywhere outside the coal and steel industry (even in atomic energy); and even when one regards his competition with Britishexporters, it is probably just as well that his very large investment in coal and steel should remain where it is.7. There are two main factors in the timing of a decision to waive fulfilment of the Federal Governments obligation:(a) We are committed to inform Parliament of any change of policy before any irrevocable step is taken to alter the deconcentration agreements.This means that we ought to announce our decision to Parliament after we had reached agreement with the United States and french governments, and before we had entered into any negotiations withthe Federal German Government.(b) There is a risk that our decision might be exploited by the opponents ofour applications to join the Common Market. Because of this latterfactor I am not making any definite proposal about the timing of our decision but I should welcome the views of my colleagues on this. Onthe other hand I am seeking approval now for the decision of principle,since without this we could not consult with our United States andFrench partners about the timing and other details, or begin to prepare the ground in Parliament for our decision (the news that the MixedCommittee have just granted a further extension of time will no doubtprovoke questions).recommendation. I invite my colleagues to agree that we must accept the unpopularity ofthe inevitable decision to waive fulfilment of the Krupp Deconcentration Plan.I invite my colleagues to decide:(a) That Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to join with theUnited States and French Governments in waiving further fulfilmentby the Federal German Government of their deconcentrationobligation under the Bonn Settlement Convention.(b) That in the timing of this, care must be taken in particular to avoidpolitical damage in Parliament to our approach to the Common market and in general to choose the most favourable Parliamentary occasion.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,26th January, 1962.60325
ANNEXGOVERNMENT STATEMENTS15th October, 1952The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: With your permission, Mr. Speaker,and that of the House, I wish to make a statement on the case of Herr Alf ried Krupp.Alfried Krupp is the son of Gustav Krupp, who was arraigned as a major warcriminal by the International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg, but found unfitto plead. He succeeded his father as head of Krupps at the end of 1943.Alfried Krupp, together with a number of other industrialists in the british zone, was handed over towards the end of 1946 by the authority of the late government to the United States authorities for trial in the American Zonal war crimes Court. He was tried and convicted in 1948 of having employed slave labourand of having plundered occupied territories. He was sentenced to 12 years&apos;imprisonment and to the confiscation of all his property. On the other hand, hewas acquitted on charges of crimes against peace and conspiracy.In January 1951 the American High Commissioner reviewed the sentencesimposed by this American court. He decided to reduce Krupp&apos;s prison sentenceto the six years already served and to revoke the confiscation of his property. Asthe right honourable Gentleman, the Leader of the Opposition, said in his statement on 12th February, 1951, the review of Krupp&apos;s sentence was entirely a matter forthe American High Commissioner, who was under no obligation to consult HisMajesty&apos;s Government.In reviewing Krupp&apos;s sentence, the American High Commissioner found thatthis was the only case in which a war criminal had been sentenced to forfeiture ofproperty (this was not done even in the case of Goering and Ribbentrop). he felt that confiscation in this instance was not justified by any special considerationsattaching to Krupp.Under an Allied High Commission Law of May 1950, approved by His LateMajesty&apos;s Government, the French Government and the United States Government,the whole German coal and steel industry was to be reorganised so as to break upexcessive concentrations of economic power. Under that Law, the Krupp coal andsteel complex is being broken up into independent units; and an Order is to beissued under which Krupp will be compelled to sell his securities in the coal andsteel companies. No provision was made under that Law by which Krupp&apos;sholdings in these companies could be confiscated either in whole or in part. Onthe contrary, in view of the decision to revoke the confiscation of Krupp&apos;s property,the effect of this Law was to provide him with compensation for all his holdings.No reliable estimate can yet be formed of the amount which the sale of Krupp&apos;ssecurities will realise but it will run into many millions. Needless to say, this moneywill be drawn entirely from German sources.So much for the past. As to the future, we are seeking to ensure that HerrKrupp shall not be allowed to use the proceeds of the sale of his holdings to buyhis way back into the coal and steel industries or otherwise to acquire a controlling interest. The means of achieving this end are under discussion in Germany betweenthe High Commission and the Federal Government.4th March, 1953The Minister of State [Mr. Selwyn Lloyd): With your permission,Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I wish to answer Question No. 104 on thearrangements now concluded with regard to the Krupp organisation.Since the statement made on 15th October by my right hon. Friend extensivediscussions have been proceeding between the three Allied High Commissioners,the Federal Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, and representatives of Herr Alfried Krupp.These have now resulted in an agreed plan.
The Krupp organisation has been broken up in the following manner. Theformer Krupp coal and steel interests, which were separated in 1947 from the restof the Krupp organisation, are being transferred to three new companies, two for coal and one for steel.Herr Krupp&apos;s share holdings in these companies will be sold. He will thus be deprived of ownership and of any controlling interest. With regard to the proceeds of sale, which he will receive, an undertaking has been obtained from Herr Kruppin the following terms:He will not through the use of the proceeds of the aforementioned saleof securities acquire or own any securities of or any interest in any enterpriseengaged directly or indirectly in the steel or iron producing industries inGermany or in the coal mining industry in Germany.He has also undertaken that:He will not, directly or indirectly, acquire or own a controlling interest in,or occupy a controlling position in any enterprise engaged directly or indirectlyin the steel or iron producing industries in Germany or in the coal miningindustry in Germany.This undertaking has been formally incorporated in the Krupp DeconcentrationPlan, to which legal effect has been given by an order promulgated in Bonn to-dayunder Allied High Commission Law No. 27.The House may also like to know that, under the plan, the special privileged position particularly in the matter of death duties enjoyed by the Krupp familyconcern since 1943 is abrogated, and that Herr Krupp will be responsible for thepayment of pensions to a large number of former Krupp employees. this commitment has been estimated at about  1 million a year.Under the provisions of the Bonn Conventions, signed last May, the federal government undertook to ensure that all deconcentration plans are carried through.The Federal Government will continue to give effect to Allied High CommissionLaw No. 27 until the whole deconcentration programme for the West Germaniron and steel industry has been completed. The remaining assets of the formerfirm of Friedrich Krupp, which include shipyards, engineering works, and miscellaneous trading concerns, are retained by Herr Krupp.The House will recall that, as my Right Hon. Friend made clear on15th October, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had to deal with this problemwithin the limits set by certain previous decisions.  These were:(i) That the decisions taken in August 1946 about deconcentration had been limited to hiving off the coal, iron and steel interests only.(ii) Herr Krupp had been handed over for trial in the American Zone inNovember 1946.(iii) No steps had been taken to confiscate Herr Krupp&apos;s property, inaccordance with the sentence of forfeiture imposed by the Americancourt in June 1948, during the time in which it would have been lawfulfor this to be done.(iv) Allied High Commission Law No. 27 of May 1950, which dealt with thedeconcentration of the coal, iron and steel industries, not onlycontained no provisions for confiscation but in fact specificallyprovided for compensation for dispossessed owners.(v) After January 1951, when the sentence of forfeiture was rescinded, no power remained to confiscate any of Herr Krupp&apos;s property.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the present settlement providesin these circumstances the best possible solution of this difficult problem.
