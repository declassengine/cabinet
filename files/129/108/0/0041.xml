Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1962C. (62) 41 Copy No. 4 026th February, 1962CABINETNORTHERN RHODESIA-constitution memorandum by the Prime minister the Cabinet last discussed this question on 1st February shortly before theCommonwealth Secretary left London for discussions with the Federal Governmentin Salisbury. The Cabinet then agreed to two alternative proposals being put toSir Roy Welensky, namely:(a) Simply to abolish the numerical alternative and require all candidates toobtain 12-^ per cent, of the votes cast; the Government assumed that,if this course Were adopted, it would be generally agreed that the Asianseat should be abolished, and thought this would be right.(b) To reduce the qualifying percentage for all candidates to 4 per cent, ofthe registered voters of each of the two races without any numericalalternative; in this case the Asian seat would be retained (C.C. (62)10th Conclusions, Minute 7).The Commonwealth Secretary put these alternatives to Sir Roy Welensky.2. Sir Roy Welensky said that, although he had hoped that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would adhere to the June proposals, he would nevertheless and withgreat reluctance acquiesce in the abolition of the numerical alternative and theequalisation of the qualifying percentage as between the two races at 12  per cent,of the votes cast.3. He subsequently intimated that he would be prepared to accept 8 per cent,of the registered votes which is equivalent to 10 per cent, of the votes cast on an80 per cent. poll. In each case, however, he insisted that the Asian seat shouldbe retained.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
4.   Two points therefore must now be decided:(i) Whether the percentage shall be 12  per cent, or 10 per cent, of the votescast. (To use the basis of votes cast is more consistent with previous white Papers.)(ii) The abolition or retention of the Asian seat.Arguments for Abolition5. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia holds the view that abolition of the asian seat is necessary for African acquiescence in the Constitution and participation in the election.6. Sir John Moffat, the leader of the Liberals, and the members of his partyseem rather uncertain about African reaction but after discussion in Lusaka theLiberal Ministers have expressed the view that there is very grave danger ofrejection of the proposed Constitution by the African Nationalist Parties if the asian seat remains; but that if it were abolished it would be difficult for theUnited National Independence Party (U.N.I.P.) to boycott the Constitution andthat it appeared to them absurd to run such a risk.7. The Asian community themselves are pressing strongly for the abolitionof the seat and the restoration of their right to vote like other citizens in theNational seats.Arguments for Retention8.   The arguments for retention are:(i) Sir John Moffat and the Liberals are prepared to accept the retentionof the Asian seat. One African Nationalist Party, the African national congress, is likely to co-operate in the new Constitution, whether ornot the Asian seat is abolished and to work for further political advancewithin the Legislature. The attitude of the more extreme AfricanParty, U.N.I.P., is uncertain. They may acquiesce in the retention ofthe Asian seat, but on the other hand it is possible that even if the asian seat is abolished they may boycott the Elections.(ii) The Asian seat was introduced in June after discussions with the federal government. As part of the agreement an additional 500 Africanswere added to the Upper Roll. If therefore the Asian seat were cancelled, it would be claimed that it was necessary to remove the 500;but this is thought likely to cause great difficulties.(iii) There are respectable precedents within the Commonwealth for specialseats for minorities.These arguments are nicely balanced and in order to reach a decision some wider considerations need to be taken into account.
The Future of the Federation9. We have to face in a few weeks a demand from the African leader in nyasaland, Dr. Banda, for Nyasaland&apos;s secession from the Federation. unless we can act in agreement with the Federal Government on this issue we shall be ingreat difficulty, and if Northern Rhodesia has an anti-Federal majority in theLegislative Council, which seems probable whether the Asian seat is abolished ornot, the same situation will occur in a year&apos;s time in Northern Rhodesia.   &apos;10. It is clear therefore that we have to face the problem of reconsideration of the Federation on perhaps a very wide basis. If we abandon the Asian seatagainst our June Understanding with Sir Roy Welensky in addition to abandoning the numerical alternative, to which he has reluctantly agreed, we shall of course have a very severe dispute and accusations of bad faith from the federal government. This will make it more difficult to get their co-operation in theproblems of Nyasaland and ultimately Northern Rhodesia.11. On the other hand, it is argued that abolishing the Asian seat in addition toequalising the first hurdle will increase the chance of African co-operation and reduce the security risks.12. We have to weigh these considerations in reaching a conclusion as towhat announcement we must now make regarding the Constitution of northern rhodesia.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. I,24th February, 1962.
