CABINETESTIMATES, 1962-63Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general  can now put before the Cabinet a preview of the Estimates for 1962-63.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer with the authority of the Cabinet toldParliament on 25th July: &quot; I intend to do my utmost to keep the increase [ofGovernment Supply expenditure in 1962-63] to a level of not more than 2\ percent, in real terms . . . that is to say about  125 million above the Estimates for1961-62.&quot;3. This undertaking was repeated in the course of the negotiations with theauthorities of the International Monetary Fund that resulted in their agreeing to lend us  535 million, with which we were enabled to defend sterling.Supplementaries 1961-624. The Supplementary Estimate of  78 million for agriculture wasembarrassing, and raised questions about Government ability to controlexpenditure. The net outturn of expenditure in 1961-62 will probably be over 150 million above the Budget Estimate. This means that, in effect, we have hadto use the proceeds of the 10 per cent, tax surcharge &quot; regulator &quot; to cover extra expenditure, whereas it was intended to disinflate the economy.Estimates 1962-63 %5. Our supporters in Parliament wish to see us curbing expenditure. Infact it is rising rapidly. As the Annex shows, the 1962-63 Estimates at presenttotal  5,610 million. This includes an estimate of  50 million for reopening the1962-63 general grant (mainly teachers&apos; pay) and also assumes that the colleges of Advanced Technology will not be taken over from the local authorities until april 1963.6. The 1961-62 Estimates were  5,187 million. To that, for comparability,we must add  40 million because, in the new form of Estimates, teachers&apos; anddoctors&apos; superannuation contributions are treated as an Exchequer Extra Receiptand not as an Appropriation-in-Aid.  This gives  5,227 million.7. The 1962-63 increase is therefore  383 million, or 7-3 per cent. Thecorresponding increase this time last year was  347 million, and we had to increasethe health stamp and impose health charges so as to reduce it to  280 million.8. In The Queen&apos;s Speech, we again emphasised our purpose of keeping public expenditure within limits justified by the national resources. The prospective increase of 7 - 3 per cent in supply expenditure in fact compares with a prospective increase of about 5 per cent, (in money terms) in the gross national product.60197THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC &apos;MAJESTY&apos;S government.

Pledge10. The Budget Estimate for 1961-62 (as modified in paragraph 6) was 5,227 million. The equivalent of this at 1962-63 levels of pay and prices would be 5,366 million.11. The Estimates for 1962-63 at  5,610 million therefore show a rise of 244 million on this figure, an increase of A\ per cent., whereas the Chancellor^pledge was  125 million or 2\ per cent, (now equivalent to  134 million). Evenif we take the higher figure of  134 million, there is  110 million to get off.12. Abolition of the welfare milk subsidy for families with less than fourchildren will save  19 million. Increasing the school meals price to Is. 6d. will save 17 million. A minimum determination in the farm price review will save, say, 15 million. These three measures would reduce the gap from  110 million to 59 million. The increase on 1961-62 will still be over %\ per cent. Obviouslywe must get every pound off the Estimates that we can. We have still got a longway farther to go to honour the pledge we have given.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,2nd January, 1962.
