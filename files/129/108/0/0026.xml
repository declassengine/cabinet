Copy No.   50CABINETHOME DEFENCE: DISPERSAL policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and Minister for Welsh AffairsFollowing a report by officials of their review of Home Defence Policy in 1960,the Cabinet asked the Defence Committee to discuss dispersal policy. The DefenceCommittee agreed that the local authority associations should be consulted. Thiswas done, and at a meeting of the Defence Committee on 1st February, 1962,it was agreed that the matter should be considered by the Cabinet.2. The issue now is whether a dispersal scheme should be prepared. Itspreparation would not commit the Government to the view that dispersal mustbe ordered in an emergency. No one can foresee whether conditions at the time would permit this to be done. But the Government of the day would not evenhave the choice of whether or not to order dispersal if no scheme had been planned in advance.Consultations with the Local Authority Associations3. The consultations showed that the associations in England and Waleswere strongly in favour of including in civil defence planning the preparation of adispersal scheme. They were told that only the western half of the country anda small part of south-east England could be regarded as suitable for receptionpurposes, and they said that intensive use should be made of these areas.Simultaneous consultations in Scotland showed similar strong support by localauthority associations for a planned dispersal scheme.4. In the light of the associations&apos; view a revised outline scheme has beenprepared for England and Wales providing for the dispersal of 9J million people in the priority classes (i.e., children accompanied by mothers or other responsiblepersons, and other children Under the age of 18; expectant mothers; people whoare blind, crippled or aged and infirm, and who are dependent on the care of aperson who is a member of the priority classes) from 19 different centres. Itis illustrated in the accompanying map. In Scotland the scheme will provide fordispersing about one million people from Clydeside and Edinburgh.The Next Steps5. The first step would be for the Government to make an announcement.This could be quite brief; it would be sufficient to say:&quot; The Government have reviewed dispersal policy in the light of developments in the strategic situation over recent years, and have hadconsultations with the local authority associations. They have concluded that although the circumstances that might precede an attack upon us cannot before seen, it is necessary to have available a scheme which could be implemented,if it were thought right to do so, for dispersing mothers and children and other people in &apos; priority classes &apos; from major centres of population. The detailed application of the scheme will be worked out with the help of local authorities.&quot;The Defence White Paper, which will shortly be published, would provide anopportunity to make such an announcement.C. (62) 269 th February, 1962.60394Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1962
6. Shortly after the announcement all local authorities would be told the broad outline of the scheme, including their individual classification [i.e., dispersal, neutralor reception), and particulars of the priority classes. They would also be told thatthe local authority associations were to be consulted about the detailed planning.It would be emphasised that the scheme was to be prepared only so that it woufdbe available if required, and not on the basis that it would inevitably be carried outiff jjTn emergency.7. It would thus become known which parts of the country were dispersal,neutral and reception areas, but it is understood that the Air Ministry would see noobjection to this on security grounds. It would not be necessary to disclose any information relating to secret strategic assessments forming the basis of homedefence planning.8. After local authorities had been informed as in paragraph 6, a draft memorandum about detailed planning would be sent to the associations forcomment.  Broadly the proposals in the memorandum would be as follows:(a) Planning of main journeys by rail or bus from dispersal areas to reception areas would be undertaken by the transport authorities in consultationwith the Ministry of Transport.(b) In dispersal areas local authorities would make plans for the assembly anddeparture of people in the priority classes, including those travelling by private transport.(c) In reception areas local authorities would plan billeting.(d) The police would be kept in touch with all stages of planning.9. After the associations had discussed the proposals, a final version of thememorandum would be issued to local authorities so that detailed planning of thescheme could start. No basic information about the scheme additional to thatreferred to in paragraph 6 would need to be given at this or any later stage.Conclusion10. As a Government we cannot take the easy course of remaining silentindefinitely. It is almost three years since the Commons were told that we werereviewing dispersal policy. And the local authorities will expect soon to know the outcome of the consultations with them last July.11. The only reasonable alternative to preparing a scheme is to announce the abandonment of dispersal. Even if public and Parliamentary opinion wereprepared to accept that there should be no planning for dispersal of women andchildren from cities, we do not, as we have already indicated, think that it would be right, by taking such a decision now, to deprive a future Government of the powerto decide in a time of emergency whether or not dispersal was desirable.12.   We therefore recommend that:(a) a public announcement that a dispersal scheme is to be prepared shouldbe made in the Statement on Defence this month;(b) local authorities should then be told about the scheme as indicated inparagraph 6 of this paper;(c) the local authority associations should be consulted about arrangements for planning the scheme in detail.R. A. B.J. M.C. H.9th February, 1962.
