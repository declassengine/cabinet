HIS DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ^162).36. copy no.   S O23gd February,, 1^62CABINETPOST OFFICE GIRO,system memorandum by the Postmaster-general on 14th November, 1961, the Cabinet considered the publicationof a &quot;White Paper on a Post Office giro system:  invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer to obtain the views of the Bank of England, and agreedto resume discussion later (C. C. (61) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 4).2.        A letter from the Deputy Governor of the Bank is annexed.   Headvises: against setting up a Post Office giro at this stage: suggests thatthe Banks should be pressed to broaden their service for credit transfers,but adds that if, in time, the Banks demonstrably fail to meet the needsof the public the Post Office should consider filling the gap.3.        There are now two alternatives:-(a) to publish the Post Office report and test public reaction, it being made clear (as it is in thePreface to the draft White Paper (C. (61) 176))that the Government are not committed to agiro:   or(b) to say that, in view of the facilities now being developed by the Banks, the Government havedecided to take no action for the present, but will review the position if at a later date it isclear that the needs of the public are not beingadequately met.4.        My own view is that there is much to be said for publishing theWhite Paper.    It does not commit us to anything.    It would probablyact as a spur to the Banks.    There is a good deal of interest in theHouse on the subject and the fact that a departmental study has beenmade is well known.     Even though the study is only an officialdocument, I might find it difficult to resist a demand for publication.On the other hand, we must expect that the Banks would publiclycriticise the report.    No doubt the Opposition would fasten on theWhite Paper as an opportunity to press for Governmententerpsiae inthis field.-1-
5.        I should value the views ox the Cabinet.    I shall have.to say what the Government view is in mid-March, when the House debatesPosv: Office prospects for next year.J.R.B.General Post office  E. C. 1.22nd February, 1962.ANNEXBANK OF ENGLAND23rd January, 1962.Dear Sir Thomas Padmore,GiroWe have now heard further from the Clearing Banks and i accordingly wx*ite to tell you how their thinking is developing and togive yoix the Bank&apos;s views, for which you asked in your letter of20th November.So far as the Clearing Banks are concerned, the position isthat they are pleased with the development to date of the credittransfer system.     They also have every intention of adapting and improving it further;  but they have not yet reached a conclusion on whether there is justification for expanding it into a full giro oncontinental lines.     They point out that, largely because the widelydeveloped cheque system in this country is not paralleled elsewhere,the experience of continental countries in the development of girosystems is net a sound guide to the likely auceess of a full giro inthis country.    An exhaustive examination of the prospects here was put in hand some months ago but it is not yet completed and the banks&apos; present view is that the cheque system and the credittransfer system fully meet public demand as it exists at present.The use of the credit transfer system is likely to be considerablyextended as the facilities available become more widely known andit is only in the light of this development that a judgment can bemade of the demand in this country for the settlement of debts bythis method.     In the Banks&apos; experience to date the public does not-2-
want greater speed in the transmission of payments than the Banksafford and it does not find their charges excessive.    What it doesneed is a comprehensive service which gives customers, on oneaccount, transfer facilities, a cheque service and an over-draftservice - and this the Banks can, but the Post Office cannot, provide.One subsidiary point has been decided.     The Banks have considered whether, if they were to establish a full giro system,they could make it available to the public on a six^day week basis with hours of opening comparable to those of the Post Office. &apos;.   Theyhave concluded that they could not.     To do so would be uneconomic andwould impose a burden of costs which no bank would wish to sustain;;even more important perhaps, their present 5jr-day week alreadyprejudices recruitment and such an extension of hours (which theyconsider would have to apply to a full range of banking services) wouldmake this recruiting problem infinitely more difficult.     They do,however, propose to investigate the whole question of banking hoursquite apart from the context of a giro, to see whether the public might be offered a change in, or additional, opening hours withoutcreating an impossible staff position for the Banks.Thus the Banks are as yet undecided on whether there isjustification for their developing the credit transfer system into a fullgiro;  if they did sd they could not hope to match Post Office hours,but some improvement in their hours of opening generally may prove possible.    It remains the case, however, that if the Post Office wereto decide to set up a giro the Banks would then, as stated in Sir Oliver Franks&apos; letter of 29th June to the Postmaster-General, feelfree to go ahead with a giro of their own despite any doubts as to itsjustification and the volume of potential demand.     This is becausethey fear that the effect on the Banks of a Post Office giro would bea substantial diminution of deposits which would seriously reducethe Banks&apos; ability to fulfil their proper functions in the financing ofindustry and trade.    The Banks mention incidentally that they would wish the contents of Sir Oliver Franks&apos; letter to be made public at thetime of any announcement by the Post Office regarding their proposedgiro.The views of the Bank remain broadly as set out in the thenGovernor&apos;s letter of 26th October, I960, to Sir Frank Lee.    The.credit transfer system as it exists at present cannot be said to providea service comparable in speed, economy of cost and ready availabilityto the public with that projected in the Post Office report.    However,the Banks make a fair point in arguing that, before embarking on arival scheme, we should wait and see whether their present arrange-ments, when they are fully run in, widely known, and perhaps further developed, provide a generally acceptable, system for the transmission of funds.     It may be several years before this can be fairly judged.The main question in our minds is whether the Banks&apos; arrangements will adequately meet the needs of those without banking accounts.-3-
At least it seems clear that to have two giros in competition with one another would be the worst possible arrangement.     Since Ihave no doubt that the Banks1 proclaimed intention to set up a rivalsystem if the Post Office go ahead is to be taken seriously, arid givenalso the Ministerial doubts to which you referred in your letter, ouradvice would be against the setting up of a Post Office giro at this juncture.    Instead I suggest we should aim to exert pressure on the banks to improve and broaden their service, using the possibility ofaction by the Post Office as a spur if necessary.     If Ministersaccept this course, the announcement might borrow substantiallyfrom the Banks&apos; arguments for making no immediate move butindicate that Her Majesty&apos;s Government stand ready, on the lines recommended by Radcliffe, to move the Post Office to action if theneed becomes clear and if the Banks are not ready to meet that needthemselves.Yours sincerely,(Sgd. ) H.
