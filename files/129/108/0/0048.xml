C.(62) 48 COPY NO.CABINET.M^racxa dmn^y^j^^I circulate for the information of my colleagues a note on the forth-coming Disarmament Talks at Geneva by the Minister of State, ForeignOffice, (Mr. Godber).H.Foreign Office, S. W.l.7th March, 1962.DISARMAMENTNote by the Minister of State for^ Foreign AffairsThe 18-Power Disarmament Committee opens in Geneva on14th March (a list of the nations participating is given in the Appendix).They have been asked by the United Nations General Assembly to base their discussions on the principles agreed between the United Statesand the Soviet Union at New York in September, 1961.     (The text, andthe very important United States reservation, are also given in theA.appendix, )    The principles and the reservation between themadequately cover the principles set out in the Statement by Common-wealth Prime Ministers, issued in March, 1961, to which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment remain of course committed.     The 18-Power Committeehave also been asked by the United Nations General Assembly to reporton progress by 1st June to the &quot;Disarmament Commission&quot; of theUnited Nations (which consists of all Powers represented in theGeneral Assembly).2.      The We stern position for the coming disarmament talks isbased on the United States Disarmament Programme, presented by president Kennedy to the United Nations General Assembly-1-SIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
in September, 1961.    &quot;We played a considerable part ourselves in the drafting of this.     The Russian position will be based, so far as we know, on their Disarmament Plan presented to the United nations general Assembly in September, I960, (though they may still come forward with a new plan.     The main differences between the two are: -(i)   The Russian provision for fixed time limits (four years for the whole process of disarmament),(ii)  Russian insistence that &quot;foreign bases&quot; should be evacuated in the first stage of their plan, andforeign troops withdrawn from Europe as a preliminary measure.(iii)  Russian provision that all nuclear delivery vehicles,without distinction between &quot;strategic&quot; and&quot;tactical&quot;, should be destroyed in the first stage.(iv)  United States provision for a &quot;cut-off&quot; of productionof fissionable material for weapons purposes inthe first stage (the Russians provide for a second stage cut-off only).(v)  Russian insistence (made clearer in subsequentmemoranda than in their plan) that &quot;control&quot; or&quot;verification&quot;    should apply only to thedestruction of agreed quantities of weapons, andthat there should be no check on the stocks remain-ing, or the new weapons produced, afterdestruction.(vi)  United States insistence that the later stages of dis-armament should be accompanied by the rapid development of effective international peace-keeping machinery, including an effective inter-national peace-keeping force.3.      The Russian proposals are quite unacceptable to us,principally because of their position on verification;  their effort to restrict our deployment by demanding the evacuation of foreignbases and troops;  and their proposal to abolish the nuclear deterrentcompletely at an early stage.    In spite (or because) of this, their plan has considerable appeal to thoughtless or frightened people everywhere.     It is possible that the Soviet Government are genuinelyinterested in some measure of nuclear disarmament, in order toavoid the burden and risks of an arms race which they cannot bearto lose and may well be unable to afford to win.     But, whatever their ultimate intentions, it is most likely that the opening stages of the geneva Conference will witness an intense propaganda effort by theRussians to sell their existing plan, or something like it, to theuncommitted participants and to world opinion, and to discredit theUnited States Disarmament Programme.
91ki Xif4.      &quot;Whether the Geneva Conference is to degenerate into, a propaganda battle, therefore, or, as is possible, to open the wayultimately to some limited positive steps, our own task should remain the same:  to show that the Russian plans are full of contradictions anddesigned to give themselves one-sided advantages, to show that ourown are by contrast sober, realistic and fair, and above all to showthat ours provide at a very early stage for some important concretemeasures of disarmament.    All this is necessary if the Russian plans are to be rejected and if we are either (at best) to make some real progress or (at least) to have made it clear to the world that we havemade a great and real effort to break the deadlock.5.      How do we stand at present?    Briefly, our preparations fordefensive or counter-attacking argument are good.     Our preparations for a bold and positive initiative at an early stage of the conference are sadly inadequate.    Over the last month we have had two seriesof meetings of the &quot;Western Five&quot; (United Kingdom, United States,Canada, France, Italy) at expert and heads of delegation level toprepare our position for the Conference.     The United StatesDisarmament Agency have produced an admirably thorough and clearseries of papers elaborating defensive positions on all the measures proposed for the first stage of their Disarmament Programme, andto a lesser extent on procedure and tactics for the Conference.These have been supplemented by papers from the United Kingdom andother delegations and have given rise to useful discussions.     the hard fact remains however that we are not yet in a position to give to the Geneva Conference concrete proposals on the most crucialcategories of disarmament or preliminary measures - reduction of strategic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons, reduction of&quot;offensive&quot; types of conventional weapons, cut-off of fissionablematerials, and a new version of the nuclear test ban treaty;  nor can we yet propose any concrete and fresh ideas to break the presentdeadlock on inspection and verification.6.      There are mitigating factors.     The United States in officialdiscussions have promised to produce concrete ideas in these fieldsurgently.    President Kennedy, in his broadcast of 2nd March,indicated that at the Geneva Conference the United States would offer,apart from a test ban treaty, &quot;specific proposals for fair andenforceable agreements to halt the production of fissionable materials and to transfer them from weapon stockpiles to peaceable uses - to destroy the warheads and delivery systems that threaten man sexistence - to check the dangers of surprise or accidental attack - to reserve outer space for peaceful use - and progressively to reduce allarmed forces in such a way as to remove all threats and thoughts ofwar&quot;.     The United States authorities have also made it clear that, atthe Foreign Ministers&apos; Meeting before the Conference, they would hope to steer the work of the Conference towards the following subjects: -(i)  Halting of nuclear tests.(ii)   Checking the proliferation of independent nationalnuclear capabilities.
(iii)  Preventing the extension of the arms race to outerspace.(iv)  Dealing urgently with the means of limiting and reducing strategic delivery systems for nuclear weapons.(v)  Measures to prevent surprise attack.They have told us that on (i), (iii) and (v) they have definite if limited ,proposals to put forward.    It is to be hoped that the same will soon   be true of (ii) and (iv).7.      We felt some difficulty initially in pressing the United States toohard to produce further proposals.    The responsibility for a very high proportion of Western armaments is theirs.    They have acorresponding responsibility in the field of disarmament.     They have,with their great resources of manpower, put a great deal of very useful work into disarmament plans and papers.    And the DisarmamentAdministration almost certainly have great difficulties with thePentagon when they get down to concrete proposals for reductions.However, in last week&apos;s meetings at Washington we pressed the americans very hard to come up with firm positions, andMr. Arthur Dean (who will lead the United States delegation at Genevawhen the Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Rusk, is not present) under-took that certain of the key papers would be available on 11th Marchfor discussion among the &quot;Western Five&quot; at Geneva.     The Ministryof Defence have also been studying the key questions of deliveryvehicles and sample inspection.    In the meantime we have sufficientgeneral or defensive material to keep our delegates going at theConference (particularly as the opening round of speeches is likelyto be concerned mainly with generalities and propaganda).8.      All this however does not take us very far.     We need asubstantial &quot;package&quot; of proposals to put to the Conference at a fairly early stage, in order to demonstrate good faith, and to showthat we are making a great effort to achieve success at theConference.    And of course we shall need something to put to theSoviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, at the preliminary meetingof Foreign Ministers.     To take the longer-term problem first, it ismore important to put something substantial on the table than to putsomething there immediately, and we must be careful in any casenot to propose partial measures in such a way.as to give theappearance of shying away from the idea of &quot;general and complete disarmament&quot;.    At the same time, we must not allow the russians to get in ahead of us with an attractive &quot;partial&quot; offer, after theyhave also made the running with eye-catching schemes for &quot;generaland complete disarmament&quot;.    Our delegations must in fact be in aposition to table their &quot;package&quot; at any favourable time after theopening round of the Conference.

Our delegations must in fact be in aposition to table their &quot;package&quot; at any favourable time after theopening round of the Conference.
9.      The most important thing at such a time is that our &quot;package&quot;should have genuine substance.     It must in my view contain concreteproposals on:-(i)   Reduction of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.(ii)  Reduction of major items of conventionalarmament.Fositive proposals on verification, among whichsample inspection may well be the most hope-ful.(iv)   Cut-off of production of fissile material formilitary purposes.(v)   Transfer or destruction of stockpiles of fissile material for military purposes.(vi)  Safeguards against the transfer between nations of fissile material for such purposes.In addition, our &quot;package&quot; might include (largely for presentationalpurposes)proposals for:-(vii)  Measures to reduce the danger of surprise attack.(viii)  Non-aggression declarations by the North atlantic and Warsaw Pact Powers.(ix)  Studying the possibility of military expenditure in national budgets.10.      The most immediate problem is of course what should be saidto Mr. Gromyko on 12th March about disarmament problems.Obviously we must tackle the question of the treaty on banning nuclear tests.     In order to ease our position with our North Atlantic Allies(and to leave time for other subjects), we should try to confine our-selves as far as possible to the problems of disarmament in the nuclearfield, on which we have a special responsibility.     But we shall haveto be prepared for Mr. Gromyko to range widely over the field of disarmament as a whole, and particularly for an attempt to explore the possibilities of &quot;non-nuclear zones&quot;, disengagement, and regiona.,1limitation of arms.11.     So far as the wider subjects are concerned, we need not attemptto put over specific ideas, but should meet Mr. Gromyko&apos;s probingswith counter-questions or general statements.     On nuclear tests,however, it is essential to put forward our own detailed proposals,which should be seen to represent some advance on our draft treatytext of April, 1961 (this would be quite possible v/ithout going beyondthe principles agreed in the treaty).    Here the United States situation(iii)Z
2 hJis most unsatisfactory.    We put to them recently proposals designed,within the framework of the draft treaty, to meet the main Russian&apos;objectives advanced against it last spring, and thus to leave us in agood public position.President Kennedy in the meantime has said in his televisionbroadcast last Friday that we should be offering &quot;new modifications&quot;to our draft treaty at Geneva.     Yet of the only two modifications thatthe United States authorities have yet agreed to one is definitely astep backward.     The other, while valuable and in line with our ownthinking, would be insufficient on its own to interest the Russiansor to satisfy world opinion that we had made a new gesture.12.     Thinking on this whole problem too is now coloured by newscientific evidence which seems to show that national detection systemscan detect explosions in almost any environment, and certainly in the atmosphere.      Basing ourselves on this we have in addition putforward tentative thoughts to the United States on the possibility ofrelying on national detection systems at least in some environmentsso long as we retain the principle of an international organisation andmobile teams of international inspections who can be sent to investigate any disputed nuclear explosion.     These proposals likeour others have met a very discouraging response, and it is clear thatthose in the United States Administration who want to test are firmlyentrenched.     There is also a very genuine fear about congressionalreaction to any weakening of our draft treaty provisions.13.    Apart from the nuclear test treaty, we must agree on otherideas about nuclear disarmament, or supplementary measures, whichcan be put to Mr. Gromyko.     These might cover:-(i)   The non-transfer of nuclear weapons to nationsnot possessing them.(ii)   Cut-off of production of fissile material forweapons purposes.(iii)   Safeguards against the transfer of fissile material for these purposes.(iv) Some reduction in the numbers of strategicdelivery vehicles.(v)  Prevention of the use of outer space for military purposes.On (ii) to (iv) it is unlikely that concrete proposals can be produced at this stage, and in any case it may well be better to produce them as part of a substantial &quot;package&quot; to the Conference.    But we shouldbe able to indicate to Mr. Gromyko that substantial proposals will bemade in these categories, to give him some idea of their probablecontent, and to ask for his own views..    -6-
14.    In sum, therefore, we are endeavouring to finalise with theUnited States authorities ideas on nuclear disarmament that canbe discussed with Mr. Gromyko on 12th March, and a substantial&quot;package&quot; of disarmament measures which can be put before theDisarmament Conference at a suitable stage in proceedings afterthe opening round of speeches.J.

- 2 -11:   Joint.Statement of AgreedPrincupl.es for Disarmament NegotiationsHaving conducted an extensive - exchange of views on disarmament pursuant to their agreement announced in theGeneral Assembly on 30 March 1961,Noting with concern that the continuing arms raceis a heavy burden for humanity and is fraught with dangersfor the cause of world peace,Reaffirming their adherence to all the provisionsof the General Assembly resolution 1378 (XIV) of 20November 1959,Affirming that to facilitate the attainment ofgeneral and complete disarmament in a peaceful worldit is important that all States abide by existing international agreements, refrain from any actions whichmight aggravate international, tensions, and that they seeksettlement of all disputes by peaceful means,The United States and the USSR have agreed to recommend the following principles as the basis for futuremultilateral negotiations on disarmament and to call upon other States to co-operate in reaching early agreement on general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world inaccordance with these principles.1.     The goal of negotiations is to achieve agreement on a programme which will ensure that (a) disarmamentis general and complete and war is no longer an instrument for settling international problems, and(b) such disarmament is accompanied by the establishmentof reliable procedures for the peaceful settlementof disputes and effective arrangements for themaintenance of peace in accordance with the principlesof the United Nations Charter.2.    The programme for general and complete disarmamentshall ensure that States will have at their disposalonly those non-nuclear armaments, forces, facilities, &apos;and establishments as are agreed to be necessary tomaintain internal order and protect the personalsecurity of citizens;   and that States shall support-and provide agreed manpower for a United Nations peaceforce.3.    To this end, the programme for general and complete disarmament shall contain the necessary toprovisions, with respect to the military establishmentof every nation, for:(a)   Disbanding of armed forces, dismantling
2 .il  3- 3 -of military establishments, including bases,cessation of the production of armaments as well,as their liquidation or conversion to peacefuluses;(b) Elimination of all stockpiles of nuclear,chemical   bacteriological, and other weapons of mass destruction and cessation of the productionof such weapons;(c) Elimination of all means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction;.(d) Abolishment of the organisation and institutions designed to organise the military effort of States, cessation of military-training, and closing of all military training  -institutions;(e) Discontinuance of military expenditures.4.    The disarmament - programme should be implemented in an agreed sequence, by stages until it is completed,with each measure and stage carried oat within specified time-limits.    Transition to a subsequent stage inthe process of disarmament should take place upon a review of the implementation of measures included in thepreceding stage and upon a decision that all such.measures have been implemented and verified and thatairy additional verification arrangements required for measures in the next stage are, when appropriate,ready to operate.5.     All measures of general and complete disarmamentshould be balanced so that at no stage of the implementation of the treaty could any State or group of States gain military advantage and that security is ensured equally for all.6.     All disarmament measures should be implementedfrom beginning to end under such strict and effectiveinternational control as would provide firm assurance that all parties are honouring their obligations.During and after the implementation of general and complete disarmament   the most thorough control shouldbe exercised, the nature and extent of such controldepending on the requirements for verification of thedisarmament measures being carried out in each stage.To implement control over and inspection of disarmament,an International Disarmament Organisation including all parties to the agreement should be created withinthe framework of the United Nations.     This InternationalDisarmament Organisation and its inspectors should be assured unrestricted access without veto to all places as necessary for the purpose of effective verification.
2 2 0A -7,    Progress in disarmament- should be accompaniedby measures to strengthen institutions for maintaining peace and the settlement of international disputes by. peaceful means.     During and after the implementation of the programme of general and complete disarmament, there should be taken, in accordance withthe principles of the United Nations Charter, thenecessary measures to maintain international peace and security, including the obligation of States toplace at the disposal of the United Nations agreedmanpower necessary for an international peace force to be equipped with agreed types of armaments.Arrangements for the use of this force should ensurethat the United Nations can effectively deter orsuppress any threat or use of arms in violation of thepurposes and principles of the United Nations,8,     States participating in the negotiations should seek to achieve and implement the widest possibleagreement at the earliest possible date.    efforts should continue without interruption until agreement upon the total programme has been achieved, and efforts to ensure early agreement on and implementation of measures of disarmament should be undertaken without prejudicing progress on agreement on the total programme and in such a way that these measures would facilitate and form part of that programme, .A
- 5 -IIIUnited States Reservation to the AgreedPrinciples, in the Form qfjajjetterfrom Mr. McCloy to Mr. Zorin ofSeptember 20. 1961At the 18 September 1961 session of our bilateral discussions on disarmament you indicated that thedraft of a joint statement of agreed principles whichI submitted to you on behalf of the United StatesGovernment on 14 September 1961 would be acceptable to the Government of the Soviet Union provided thefollowing clause were omitted from paragraph 6:&quot;Such verification should ensure that not onlyagreed limitations or reductions take place butalso that retained armed forces and armamentsdo not exceed agreed levels at any stage.&quot;This sentence expresses a key element in the UnitedStates position which.we believe is implicit in theentire joint statement of agreed principles thatwhenever an agreement stipulates that at a certainpoint certain levels of forces and armaments may beretained, the verification machinery must have allthe rights and powers necessary to ensure that thoselevels are not exceeded.It appears from your statements that the soviet union will be unwilling to agree to a joint statementof agreed principles unless the above-mentioned clauseis omitted therefrom,,   My Government has authorizedme to inform you that, in the interests of progresstoward resuming disarmament negotiations, it is willing to remove the above-mentioned sentence from paragraph 6 of the joint statement of agreed principlessince it is an item to which the Soviet Union has not agreed.This is done upon the express understanding thatthe substantive position of the United States government as outlined in the above-quoted sentence and in ourmemorandum of 14 September 1961 remains unchanged, andis in no sense prejudiced by the exclusion of thissentence from the joint statement of agreed principles.The United States continues to adhere to and willcontinue to advance the principle contained in theomitted sentence as a necessary element in anycomprehensive disarmament negotiations or agreement.
