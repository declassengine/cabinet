1 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(6:cpy NO. i4th January, 1962CABINETRAILWAY WAGESNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe Minister of Transport has asked me to circulate, asa basis for the Cabinet&apos;s next discussion on railway wages, the attachednote by officials describing the background to the present situationand analysing possible courses of action.(Signed)  NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.1.4th Ja.january, 1962
RAILWAY WAGESNote by officials.background the present pattern of railway wages was fixed in the lightof the Guillebaud Report.    In June I960, a settlement was made(effective from hth January, i960) which gave an 8% increase tothe conciliation grades and a 1C% increase to salaried staff.     InApril 1961 a reduction of hours (without loss of pay) was agreedwhich is broadly equivalent to a 5% increase in the &quot;basic wage.This concession is effective from the 1st January, 1962.     Theunions are now claiming an increase of 10 to M% as representingthe extent to which they have fallen &quot;behind the comparisonsrecommended in the Guillebaud Report.    The Ministry of Transportregard some of the unions&apos; arguments and comparisons as fallaciousand regard        as &quot;being a fair measure of the extent to which therailways have lagged &quot;behind on the Guillebaud basis.     If reference is made not to a league table of thirteen particular industries which formed the basis of the Guillebaud recommendations but tothe wider picture of the movement of wages over the past two years,taking into account the hours reduction mentioned above, anincrease of 6 to 7% could be regarded as sufficient to justify a claim that the broad basis of comparability was being maintained.2.     As has just been said, the railways have ,;falien behind&quot; other forms of employment and this is affecting their ability to recruitlabour, especially in certain grades and in certain areas like theMidlands where competition with other employment is particularlyacute.     On the other hand, in general the railways&apos; need formanpower is gradually declining, so that it can scarcely he saidthat over the country as a whole the staffing situation is in anyway desperate.     Prima facie this would point to a concentration of any wage increases on certain grades and certain areas ratherthan any overall advance.     But any such settlement would run counter to what has become well-established practice on the rail-ways - namely that there should be national wage settlements - andwould be bitterly opposed by the unions.3*     There is basically a clash of principle implicit in the presentsituation - namely whether (as the unions explicitly claim) railway wages are to be settled on the Guillebaud basis of comparabilityor whether some other basis should be applied more nearly alignedto the general rate of increase which the economy as a whole willbe able safely to afford in 1962/63.      In short,  should theGovernment attempt to make a clean break with Gtiilleb&amp;ud atthis juncture or not?1
k.     The position is complicated by the attitude of Dr. Beeching,who clearly does not want to be seen &quot;by the railway , unions asbreaking with the Guillebaud basis, though he is prepared to arguefor a settlement of, say, 6%o      It is doubtful whether he wouldbe prepared to put forward on his own account any offer of lessthan 5% (as an opening bid for a settlement at 6%),5.     The agreement which covers railway wage negotiations providesthat either side has the right to go to arbitration and that theworkers may not strike until the negotiating machinery, which includes arbitration, has been fully utilized.     Formally thereis nothing to provide that arbitration awards are binding, butin practice the British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) has alwaysimplemented them in the past.Thus in considering possible solutions it must be borne in mind that the Transport Commission could always be taken to arbitration by the unions and that indeed this would be the correct procedureif there is disagreement.      In considering the possible outcome of arbitration,  it must be remembered that in practice a great dealwould depend on the force and conviction with which the transport commission  argued their case before the Tribunal.    (Dr. Beechingwould not have to do this himself, but his general attitude wouldbe an important factor - see paragraph h above - and he might wellfeel that his position vis a vis the unions   would be damaged ,)If on the other hand the Transport Commission virtually let their case go by default the &quot;calculated gamble&quot; of arbitration would bemuch less attractive.6.     In effect any wage increase will fall directly on theExchequer and will increase pro tanto the present deficit of theBritish Transport Commission, which is expected to be  135 m. inthe current f inane i a 1 year and to increase to  150 m.. in 1962/63regardless of any wage increase.        (An overall increase of 6% -equivalent to 10s. on the basic weekly rate - would cost  20 m.a year).     Theoretically there would be some scope for making goodsome part of a wage increase by higher charges and economies, but inpractice it would be unrealistic to expect that in the coming financial year anything substantial would be obtained in this way -quite apart from the consideration that any such additional incomeought in principle to go to reduce the heavy call on the exchequer to meet the deficit.7.     Given (i) the fact that the cost of any wage increase will fall directly on the Exchequer (ii) the political and public interestin the railway wage issue as a &quot;test case&quot;, the Government willbe unable to disclaim all responsibility for the ultimate settlement.2
But it would be undesirable to have a situation in which theGovernment were brought too directly into detailed negotiation ofa settlement (especially as this might become a precedent forother nationalized industries - e.g. the coal mines).It follows from what has Just been said that, where in thefollowing section of this memorandum reference is made to government intervention or non-intervention, this would be likely to be amatter of degree rather than of an absolute distinction.II.POSSIBLE   COURSES , OF   ACTION8.     In the following paragraphs we analyze various ways of handling the railway wage claim under two main heads according asto whether the Government does or does not openly intervene in thematter.9.     On the basis that the Government does not openly intervene,the possibilities would be:-(a)    Settlement bymnegotiationTo authorise the B.ToC. to reach the best settlement they can,which is likely to mean an increase of 6% (or possibly 7%)from 1st April, 1962.The adjjjitages^ of this would be:-(i)    It is what Dr. Beeching himself advocates,(ii)    It would retain the goodwill of the railwaymen and thusfacilitate the reorganisation of the railways,(iii)    It Y/ould avoid the economic loss which a strike would cause.The disadvantages are:-(1)   Although an increase from 1st April, 1962, might nottechnically break the pay pause, an increase of as muchas 6%, however carefully it were presented, would gravely jeopardise the possibility of getting something like 2^-3% accepted as a &quot;norm&quot; for the 1962 wage round.(2)   A settlement at this level might mean in effect that weshould be saddled perhaps indefinitely with the continuanceof the Guillebaud &quot;comparability&quot; basis for the railways.(3)   An increase of 6% would add  20 m. a year to the deficit of the B.T0C0 falling directly on the Exchequer.(h)    There would be a widespread feeling that if the Govern-ment cannot keep wage increases to a reasonable level ina field where it provides the money,  talk of a wages policy must be meaningless.3
SECRET30AM,&quot;,split offer&quot;To authorise the B.T.C. to offer, say, 3% from the1st April next with a firm offer of a further -similarincrease from April 1963.      Such an offer, if it werenegotiable, would do less damage to the Government&apos;swages policy than a settlement at 6% and would probablyseem reasonable to the public.     On the other hand,  ifa settlement could only be reached on a &quot;split offer&apos; ata higher figure (say, two instalments of k% each), itseems doubtful whether this could be regarded asconsistent with the Government1s wages policy in the short - or longer- term;    and, by giving the impression that a k% increase was an acceptable annual &quot;norm&quot;, might even do more harm than, say,  a 6 - 1% settlement.      Itis not known whether Dr. Beeching would be prepared tomake an offer of 3% plus 3% on his own authority.   Evenif he were it seems doubtful whether the Unions would accept it.     It would be a complete departure from the guillebaud basis and would probably be denounced bythe Unions as such.Normal^ arbitrationTo insist on the dispute going to arbitration,preferably on the basis of a modest but not whollyunreasonable offer by the B.T.C. of,  say, 2-3%.    Butif the B.T.C. were unwilling to make such an offer theymight nevertheless say that the differences between theparties were so great that it was felt that no offercould be made and that the Arbitration Tribu nal must decide.    The B.T.C. would presumably be asked and theGovernment would have to state in advance whether theaward would be honoured.    The Government would&apos;&quot;,presumably say that it would honour the award, exceptin so far as it was given from a date earlier than 1stApril, 1962.This   course would have the advantages that:-(i)    There would be no departure from theexisting machinery,(ii)   Neither the Government nor the B.T.C. wouldbe directly responsible for the figure and date chosen.4
The disadvantages would he that:-(1)    If the unions&apos; case were vigorously contested &quot;bythe BoToC. a moderate and satisfactory award mightbe given;    but there would be a real risk that theaward might be substantially more than 6%.(2)   The Arbitration Tribunal might give an award from, say,the 1st January,   1962.    If the Government wishedto avoid the risk of this,  it would have to ensurethat an advance warning was given that no award wouldtake effect before,  say,  the 1st April next.     Thatin itself would be strongly criticized by theunions .(3)    The railwaymen, who are getting impatient, woulddislike being forced to arbitration, which takestime, especially if this were on the basis of&apos;hoaward before the 1st April, 1962&quot;.      It might not succeed in preventing local strikes and &quot;go-slows&quot;.(k)   A generous arbitration award would be much less effective, from the BoT.Co&apos;s point of view,   thana generous agreed settlement, in retaining the goodwill of the men and the unions.(5)    The Government might be criticised for allowingso important an issue,  involving so heavy a potential burden on the Exchequer to be settled by arbitration.   But any such allegation that theGovernment was abdicating responsibility could be countered by a reminder that the principle ofarbitration has for long been accepted by governments of all parties and that a largeproportion of wa^e and salary increases in thepublic service (the cost of which falls cfirectlyon the Exchequer) are in fact settled in this way.10.     Since the large railway deficit has to be met by exchequer grant, the Government could reasonably claim the right to intervene in the present wage claim in a way which would be inappropriate inthe case of the other nationalised industries.      The issue wouldthen become openly one between the unions and the Government. as things stand, Dr. Beeching is prepared to negotiate on his own responsibility and to get the best settlement he can;    alterna-tively, he would want to receive an order from the Minister asto the line which he is to pursue and he would not conceal thefact that he was acting on instructions.     On this basis5
se   vythe possibilities might be:-(d) No.funds *To announce that no additional money will be provided tomeet a wage increase until further notice.T1:ie adv ant agree   of this would be that:-(i)    It would preserve the full rigour of the pay pause,(ii)    It would have a salutary effect in other industries,(iii)    It would avoid increasing the cost of the railwaysto the Exchequer.The dissudy ant ages would be that:-(1 )    It would be unacceptable to the unions and would undoubtedly cause a strike.(2)    It would appear unreasonable to the general public,who are aware that on merits the railwaymen have afair case for some increase.(3)    It would be unacceptable to Dr. Beeching, who mightwell say that he could not usefully continue in office.(e) Mjy ted. f undj3The Government could say that it was prepared to makefunds available for a wage increase but on only a limited scale.     This might be presented as a total sum of say, 10 m. (equivalent to about a 3% wage increase), to be madeavailable in 1962, on the basis that the Government would leave it to the B.T.C. and the unions to settle the detailedallocation of the total amount either in the form of ageneral increase or in the form perhaps of special increases for different grades, localities, etc.     On the other hand,it might be taken as an overt wage subsidy and mightdiscourage the B.T.C.&apos;s own efforts to achieve viability.An alternative method of presentation would be for theGovernment to undertake to provide the B.T.C. with such fundsas might be needed to honour an increase of x.% (or to honoura &apos;split offer&apos; Qf 3% plus 3% on the lines of paragraph 9(b)above.)    This formula would leave room for pressing theB.T.C. to meet at least a part of the increased wages by increased charges and additional economies.A firm statement by the Government on the above lines would have the advantage of appearing reasonable and ofaccording with the Chancellor&apos;s policy of looking for generalwage restraint in 1962;    but recognising the need for increases in certain special cases (of which the railwayscould reasonably claim to be one).
S 1c d* ff^ 6  Y33The question is, however, whether an attempt to impose a settlement on these lines would: &apos; -(i)    avoid a strike, and(ii)   avoid the loss of Dr. Beeching.A strike, though damaging to the long-term prospects ofthe railways and to the economy, might not be anunmitigated disaster, provided that it could be successfully resisted with the general support of the community and thatit helped to damp the general pressure for higher wages.It would of course be disastrous if the Government were obliged to end the strike by an over-generous settlement.The loss of Dr. Beeching would be a serious setback to thehopes of getting the railways on to a sound footing, since it is unlikely that anyone of equal calibre would be willingto step into his shoes.     A decade of railways administration under indifferent leadership rffould cost the Exchequer and thecommunity hundreds of millions of pounds.    (The loss mightnot be confined to Dr. Beeching alone:    some of his closeassociates might resign with him.)(f)    &quot;Arbitration&quot; with special terms of reference the Government might propose that instead of going to ordinary arbitration there should be a special tribunal which would be specifically asked to make a judgment onwhich rate of increase would be appropriate taking all circumstances into account - e.g. the Guillebaud background,the general state of the economy, the railway deficit andso on.The advantage of this course might be that, if thetribunal acted sensibly, a modest award (of,, say, k-5%)would be given, a lasting break would have been achievedfrom the Buillebaud concept,  and that in any event theGovernment would not be held responsible for the settlement.^e disadvantapes of such a course would be that:-(1)    It would be a depaeture from the normal machinery of negotiation and arbitration.(2)    If the tribunal were specifically asked to make an award on a Guillebaud basis or gave undue emphasis tothis the result might well be a disastrous figure of10 or ^^%.(3)    Hov/ever the terms of reference were drawn, experience suggests that the findings of ad hoc tribunals ofthis type are unpredictable and often highly embarrassing.(Ij)   Even a favourable settlement achieved in this way wouldearn little good will from the men and the facade ofobtaining an independent judgment without submission
to normal arbitration would be of relatively little value to the Government.(5)   It seems improbable in any case that the unions, who areentitled to seek arbitration from the standing tribunal,would be willing to let the matter be referred to an ad hoc body whose terms of reference, if they were acceptable to the Government, would appear to be  &apos;rigged&apos;against thenu2nd Januarvi?-n 1962
