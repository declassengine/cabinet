THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1962C. (62) 4 Copy No. 574th January, 1962CABINETEDUCATIONAL expenditure memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster general  would like to reply to the memorandum by the Minister of Education(C. (61) 221).2. This is not a discussion about education as such, for no one disputes thevalue of education. It is about the way in which we are going to lay out ouravailable national resources.3. I attach a table of educational investment up to 1965-66, setting out theprogramme to which the Minister wishes to hold, and an alternative proposal whichI suggest is more in line with our available resources. My proposal shows anannual average investment of  116 million in 1960-61, 1961-62 and, 1962-63 andof  121-1- million in 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66. This cannot be called a &quot; cut &quot;in education investment. ,4.   My proposal would provide for:(i) A primary and secondary schools programme of &quot; starts &quot;of  55 million a year in 1962-63 onwards. This would give the  300 million &quot; starts &quot;envisaged in the 1958 White Paper (Cmnd. 604) by, say, July 1965,instead of March 1965 which was the original intention. It is of course for the Minister to say how this would be best divided between thevarious purposes. But it should provide, with the minor works, the equivalent of something like 250,000 new places a year for a school population of nearly 7 million which is not in the aggregate risingsignificantly, although of course shifts of population are taking place.(ii) In the field of further education, &quot; starts &quot; in 1962-63 and subsequent years at  15 million a year. This was the rate indicated by the Ministryas the commitment for &quot; starts &quot; in 1962-63 and 1963-64, in its annual report issued in July 1961. air : A &apos;Vi&quot;iJ     r::;(hi) Teacher training college &quot; starts &quot; slightly phased out- 46 million in the six years from 1960-61, instead of  50 million according to the Ministersprogramme. This could not affect the supply of teachers even marginallybefore the 1970s.(iv) Other work. A slight reduction on the Minister^ programme.5. In total, my proposal would produce an average for the three years1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66 above the present high level of education investment,and in volume probably about 20 per cent, above that of the second half of the 1950s.6. To do this in the way I propose would involve some postponement of&quot; starts &quot; in 1962-63&apos;, as compared with the authorisations for 1962-63 which wereprovisionally notified to the local authorities in July 1960. I do not think theMinister would contend that these are &quot; committed &quot; in the sense that there is adefinite Government obligation to permit every one of these to go forward in1962-63. Indeed, it would be manifestly absurd for the Government to make sodefinite a commitment several years before the bulk of the expenditure would be60205
incurred. Since July 1960 we have run into economic difficulties, and I do notthink that educational building can, as it were, contract out of the immediate measures needed to bring us through.7. I fully realise that it is unpleasant for the Minister to have to say to some local authorities that they must postpone for some months some of the projects which he hoped in July 1960 that they would be able to start in 1962-63. Forschools and further education and teacher training, it would altogether be a postponement of &quot;starts&quot; amounting to  12 million out of  88 million which ithad been hoped it would be possible to start in 1962-63. ^ . ,v, - ;8. Consistently with the three-year total which I am proposing in fact itwould be possible to let the 1962-63&apos; authorisations remain unaltered and thusavoid that particular difficulty. But this would involve much larger adjustmentslater, and I would not recommend that course.9.   To summarise:(i) My proposal does not call for any breach of a Government commitment for 1962-635 even if it does means telling some local authorities thatthey could not go ahead quite as fast as had been hoped.(ii) This is not a &quot;cut &quot; in educational investment.   On my proposal it willbe higher, not lower, than now.(iii) I do not think the Minister will dispute that, given the need, it would bepossible to frame a sensible educational development programme onthese lines.(iv) The need arises because we cannot afford in the next five years a greaterincrease in the already high figure of educational investment, given theclaims for roads, hospitals, universities, etc., which had been held backin the 1950s, and thus helped to make possible the big education programme. I am asking all Ministers to play their part and toco-operate in the all-round effort required to get through these next five years, and there are difficult decisions to be taken; I am in no sensesingling out education.(v) There is no escaping the fact that the rapid growth in educational current expenditure is one of the very largest elements in the rise in public expenditure of all kinds, and it is materially affected by the size of theeducation investment programme.(vi) In my judgment, my proposal is the maximum which we have any reasonable chance of sustaining, unless we are prepared to make specialroom for education by imposing upon other programmes downwardchanges of dimensions which my colleagues have not begun to consider.H.
