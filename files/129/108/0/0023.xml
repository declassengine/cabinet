Military CommitmentsWestern Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Britain&apos;s Contribution 6
PART I.-THE SETTING3.   The basic objectives of Britain&apos;s defence policy will remain:(a) to maintain the security of this country;(b) to carry out our obligations for the protection of British territoriesoverseas and those to whom we owe a special duty by treaty orotherwise;(c) to make our contribution to the defence of the free world and theprevention of war in accordance with the arrangements we have with individual countries and under collective security treaties.We seek to exercise military power only when and where it is essential for the furtherance of these objectives, to do this with forces whose totalclaims on our resources are consistent with the maintenance of a soundeconomy, and to devise a deployment and a strategy that can rapidly be adapted to changing circumstances. Over the next decade there will undoubtedly be further rapid developments in science and technology. Newnations and new national groupings will emerge. We can expect no changein the relentless pressure of every kind from the Communist powers in pursuit of their long-term aim of bringing all mankind within their system.Alliances4. The defence policy of many nations to-day is chiefly determinedby their membership of collective security alliances. Some nations can rely on membership of one of these alliances to meet all their basic objectives.Britain&apos;s case is different. We provide simultaneously contributions to threecollective security alliances, NATO, CENTO and SEATO. . Thus we mustbe able at any time to maintain forces in three areas of the world. Onthe Continent of Europe we have stationed large forces for the last 16 years in complete contrast with our previous military dispositions.   In addition3Statement on Defence, 1962&apos;introduction. In 1957 the Government laid before Parliament a statement of britain&apos;s future policy for defence which looked forward five years to 1962.This year&apos;s statement deals with the further evolution of defence policy.2. It therefore sets out in some detail the basic objectives of the nation&apos;external policy for which armed forces, are or may be necessary; discussesthe problems of war in the nuclear age; and takes account of the economic factors which also condition the allocation of national resources to defence.A careful balance has to be struck before long-term decisions can be takenabout the strength of the forces, their equipment, deployment and strategy.
we must be able to bring force to bear in areas of the world in which wehave responsibilities of our own outside the scope of the three collective security alliances. The contribution which we make to each of these alliancesmust be judged in the light of our total contribution to the defence of freedom and the maintenance of peace, not only in Europe but also in theNear East, the Middle East and the Far East, all areas of vital interestof the Free World as a whole. War to-day, wherever it might start, wouldbe an immediate threat to the whole world.Overseas Bases and Garrisons5. The word &quot; base&quot; is often applied indiscriminately to any placeoverseas where British forces are stationed, and misleading arguments aresometimes constructed on the false premise that a static garrison is a base.The purpose of a garrison is to guard and help to maintain law and orderin the place where the garrison is located. Thus the need for a garrisonnormally flows from the responsibility of sovereignty or agreement. Themilitary need for an overseas base, however, is determined by the time required to deploy forces and weapons where danger threatens. A baseis thus a place where troops, ships, aircraft, heavy equipment, supplies and facilities for maintenance and repair can be kept for military operationselsewhere. In the Mediterranean, for example, although Army garrisonsfor local defence purposes will be maintained in Gibraltar and Malta,neither of them is now a base for Army operations elsewhere. Cyprusremains, primarily, an air base, and we shall continue to require naval andair operating facilities at Gibraltar and Malta. Aden, on the other hand,is an Army and Royal Air Force base, and Singapore is a base for all three services.6. The need for garrisons of British troops to support the civil power in internal security emergencies has demonstrably diminished already andmay be expected to diminish still further. At the same time, we may sufferrestrictions on our freedom to use some territories for military purposes, andwe must accordingly adapt our strategy. We must insure against the possibleloss of fixed installations overseas by keeping men and heavy equipment afloat,and by increasing the air and sea portability of the Strategic Reserve. this does not imply evading commitments. Greater mobility by air and sea is thebest way of fulfilling efficiently over the next five to ten years the requirementsset out in paragraph 3.War in the Nuclear Age7. In 1957 the West had undoubted superiority in the capacity to deliverstrategic nuclear weapons. To-day the West still has superiority but each side has the capacity to inflict upon the other a degree of devastation whichhas never before in human history been either possible or imaginable. an armed clash involving the vital interests of either side is, therefore, likelyto lead to the virtual destruction of both and not merely to conquest ordefeat. This truth must increasingly condition the attitude of powers to theuse of force as an instrument of policy, for Governments can no longer choose to have either a full-scale conventional war or a limited war without riskingthe use of nudear weapons.   So far in history, peace has apparently inevitably4
been punctuated by wars of steadily increasing ferocity. The massivedeterrent effect of nuclear striking power is a new fact which, if we can maintain an effective balance of force, provides a justifiable hope of holdingthe peace until disarmament provides a more lasting solution.8. We and our allies must therefore be able to deploy wherever necessarysufficient forces to hold this balance and thus prevent tension from breakinginto a major conflict. Our policy of deterring war has been severely testedin the past twelve months in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.So far it has succeeded. We must make it clear to potential aggressors,however, that we should strike back with all the means that we judgeappropriate, conventional or nuclear. If we had nothing but nuclear forces,this would not be credible. a balance must be maintained, therefore,between conventional and nuclear strength. Neither element must be so small as to encourage an aggressor to seek a quick advantage, or to risk aprovocative local incident escalating into a major war.9. In short, we must maintain carefully balanced forces to deter everyform of aggression and military threats. The Government do not believethat major war could long continue without one side or the other resorting to nuclear weapons. It is therefore the prevention of war that is vital ratherthan preparations for long drawn out conventional war.Disarmament and Nuclear Tests10. The Governments object remains the achievement of general and complete international disarmament, to be attained by stages subject toeffective control. They consider that the highest priority should be given toa Treaty banning further nuclear weapons tests, again subject to effectiveverification and control. The Government have worked patiently to reach agreement on these two issues which they regard as of outstandingimportance; they will continue to do so in spite of the little success that hasbeen achieved so far. Nevertheless, no one who has really understood the significance of the advent of nuclear weapons can seriously propose that the elimination of nuclear weapons can be separated from conventional disarma-ment. One without the other might not lessen, but only increase the riskof large conventional wars (which only appear less terrible now by comparisonwith nuclear war). Nuclear and conventional disarmament must thereforego hand in hand.Defence and the Economy11. In 1962-63 the Defence Budget will be  1,721 million or 7 per cent,of the Gross National Product. In normal conditions, forward budgetingfor f,defence needs to be for periods of not less than five years ata time. Only in this way can continuity of planning and production beprovided. We must also fit defence into the general study of public expenditure in relation to prospective resources, and as part of the newforward look at Defence Policy expenditure is being re-examined in&apos;everydetail. All public expenditure programmes, moreover, have an important effect on the economy including the balance of payments.  For most of these.5
programmes, this impact derives from the taxation required to finance them,and the non-productive manpower they absorb; for some, such as defence,other factors need careful watching, such as their competition with exportpotential in certain sectors of industry, and their direct expenditure overseas.12. Our task here, the difficulty of which should not be underestimated,is not to cut defence expenditure but to contain it. Although it is our presentaim to see that the percentage of the Gross National Product absorbed by defence does not rise significantly, some increase in its cost in absolute termsis to be expected as the national product itself increases.PART II. MILITARY COMMITMENTSWestern Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Britain&apos;s Contribution13. When the Government of the day decided to embark on the arduoustask of becoming a military nuclear power, the only other country whichpossessed a nuclear arsenal was the United States. Since then, the USSR hasbeen added to the number and France is on the way to achieving a nuclearcapability. Although the British effort in this field is manifestly smaller thanthat of either the United States or of the USSR, and although it consumes only about 10 per cent, of our defence resources, our contribution to the Westernstrategic deterrent remains significant. It is by itself enough to make a potential aggressor fear that our retaliation would inflict destruction beyond any level which he would be prepared to tolerate. Moreover, it addsconsiderably to the flexibility and dispersal of the total nuclear forces available to the West and thus to their retaliatory power. The efficacy of ourdeterrent will therefore be maintained throughout the 1960s by using ourV-bombers and fitting them with stand-off weapons, Blue Steel in the firstinstance and later Skybolt.NATO.14. The safety of our own country lies in the success of the common defence of the North Atlantic area. The Government do not believe that thedefence of Europe could be left to long-range nuclear weapons alone, northat its fate could be decided by long drawn out fighting limited toconventional forces. The Government wish to ensure that NATO forces arebalanced and NATO strategy flexible.15. Britain&apos;s duty is to contribute not only to the formulation of an agreed strategy but to make available a fair share of the forces required to fulfil that strategy. Here we have a particular problem. We have to stakeaccount of the tasks we have to perform in other parts of the world, tasks which contribute to the containment of Communism and the maintenance ofpeace and order in areas whose stability is vital to the West. Moreover, our contribution to the NATO shield forces means a deployment of forces overseas and, therefore, a heavy burden on our balance of payments.   After an6
impartial examination of our case NATO recognises the gravity of this burden&apos;and we hope to negotiate adequate means for relieving us of at least some ofthe strain on our balance of payments. Yet we accept that the provision of adequate forces to support the strategic objectives of NATO must continueto be one of Britain&apos;s primary responsibilities as far as we can see into thepresent decade. During this period the proportion of these forces to be stationed on the mainland of Europe and in Britain respectively must depend to a large extent on the balance of payments position. Meanwhile we havetaken steps in the Army Reserve Bill to maintain the strength of B.A.O.R.B.A.O.R. could, if the Berlin situation deteriorated further, be brought upto war establishment within a matter of days by the recall of reservists.Mediterranean and Near East16. Britain no longer has to discharge alone her obligations in theMediterranean. To-day, the maritime forces of the allied nations are sharinga NATO responsibility there. So far as Britain is concerned, we also havea responsibility to contribute an air strike force in support of CENTO and,under our treaty, to help with the defence of Libya. We are adjusting our forces in the Mediterranean in recognition of the fact that our responsibilitiesthere are shared with our allies; this process will continue. For the royal navy, the main base will be in Britain, but there will continue to be the needfor forward operating facilities in Gibraltar and Malta. The Royal Air force will continue to need airfield facilities at Gibraltar and Malta, and both placeswill continue to require small local garrisons. A garrison will be maintained in the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus which will continue to be themain base for our air strike force in support of CENTO and for the location of NATO early warning facilities and wireless stations essential for ourworld-wide network of military communications. The land forces in the sovereign Base Areas will be adjusted to the level adequate to safeguardthese facilities and to maintain stockpiles and other installations needed toallow rapid reinforcement. The Royal Air Force will continue to requirestaging facilities ait El Adem and Tripoli and the continued presence of asmall land force may prove necessary to meet our treaty obligation to helpin the defence of Libya against external aggression. In short, while weshall continue to maintain naval or air facilities with some land forces in gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, in none of these places need we basecontinuously large land forces for operations elsewhere; if necessary, such forces would be provided from Britain. Certain consequential changes tothe Command structure in this theatre are referred to later.The Middle East17. Peace and stability in the oil producing States of Arabia and thePersian Gulf are vital for the Western world. We are, and shall remain,responsible for military assistance to these. States in the area to which weare bound by treaty or which are otherwise under our protection. We havean obligation under treaty to protect the Arab Rulers of the Federation andother States in the Aden Protectorate and direct military responsibility Joithe defence of Aden Colony. This has meant stationing a garrison in AdenColony, and providing detachments for the assistance of Arab forces in the
Protectorate. For possible operations in the Gulf we have relied on Adenas a base and on reinforcing from Kenya. Henceforward, we plan to keepland forces psrmanently stationed in Aden and the Gulf and to reinforcethem rapidly in emergency not only by air but also by means of anamphibious inter-service task force East of Suez capable of putting ashorein the threatened areas land forces, and their heavy equipment, and ofproviding air and communications support.Africa18. At present we maintain in Kenya a part of our Army strategic reserve, which is available for supporting the civil power in the african territories for which we are responsible and as a reinforcement for our forcesin the Middle East, primarily for operations in the Persian Gulf. as explained in the preceding paragraph, alternative arrangements will be madeto support operations in the Middle East theatre. During the sixties,therefore, our military requirements in East and Central Africa will haveto be re-examined in the light of a continuing need to support the civil power. This may require the maintenance of forces in the area, but therewill be no long-term requirement for a base. In addition, we shall hope to retain facilities there for air transit, staging and force training normallyaccorded by Commonwealth countries to each other.Fas- East19. In the Far East, Britain has made it clear, with other signatories ofthe Treaty of Manila, that we are vitally interested in the preservation ofpeace and stability in South-East Asia. We have a responsibility for assisting in the forward defence of Australia and New Zealand. We sharewith them a close concern for the defence of the Federation of Malaya forwhich Britain accepted obligations under a Defence Agreement in 1957.Hitherto our contribution has been to maintain with Australia and NewZealand the Commonwealth Brigade Group in Malaya as well as otherpowerful forces stationed both in Malaya and Singapore. The Governmenthave already welcomed as a desirable aim the inclusion, of North Borneo,Sarawak, Brunei and Singapore in the proposed Federation of Malaysia.We hope that the creation of this new State would contribute to the generalstability of the area. We have agreed with the Malayan Governmentthat in the event of the creation of the proposed Federation of Malaysiathe Agreement of 1957 and its annexes shall be extended to all territories of the Federation of Malaysia, subject to the proviso that the Governmentof the Federation of Malaysia will afford to the Government of the UnitedKingdom the right to continue to maintain the bases and other facilities atpresent occupied by their Service authorities within the State of singapore and will permit Britain to make such use of these bases and facilities asBritain may consider necessary for the purpose of assisting in the defenceof Malaysia, for Commonwealth defence and for the preservation of peace in South-East Asia. The new State would of course become responsible for internal security throughout its territory and this would in due course relieveBritain of a considerable responsibility in respect of Singapore for which a8
number of major units of the British Army are at present stationed hi Malays! -Sand Singapore.  Discussions are now proceeding with the Malayan authorities- &amp;on how this changeover could best be achieved.   In the 1960s therefore our forces in the Far East will comprise land, sea and air forces with a diminishedinternal security role but a continuing task, in conjunction with our allies, forthe preservation of peace in the area.   Our main base will continue to be   ,Singapore with forces, including our contribution to the CommonwealthBrigade Group, also stationed in the Federation of Malaya.20. There will also be a continuing need for a garrison in Hong Kongfor the purpose of internal security and as an earnest of our intentions tomaintain our position in the Colony. Any military forces required to dealwith emergencies in other countries under our sovereignty or protection inthe Indian Ocean or Pacific will be provided in the first instance from theforces we plan to have available in the area for other purposes.The Atlantic and the Western Hemisphere21. In the Atlantic, we shall continue to contribute to NATO naval forces under the command of SACLANT. We are responsible for the internal security and external defence of our South Atlantic and Caribbean dependen-cies. We meet this commitment at present with local garrisons and our naval dispositions in the South Atlantic. These garrisons will no longer be our responsibility in those of our Caribbean dependencies which reach sovereignindependence. Should they, however, thereafter seek our assistance, Britainwill remain the main base for this task.PART III. THE FORCESRoles oi the Services22. Our armed forces provide a contribution to the strategic nuclear power of the West. We support NATO and SEATO with land, sea and airforces, and CENTO with our air striking force. In addition, we have tomaintain both a military presence in, and a capacity for rapid reinforcement of,some areas where we have responsibilities beyond the scope of these threeregional alliances.23: This requires forces organised and trained for mobility, both in theUnited Kingdom and in our overseas bases, as well as the means for movingthem. In the United Kingdom we have the Army&apos;s Strategic Reserve and thetransport aircraft at the disposal of the Royal Air Force. There is already the closest liaison in training and operations between the appropriateformations of the Strategic Reserve and Transport Command. the considerable degree of sea and air mobility which these forces have already achieved was amply demonstrated in the operations in July 1961 to supportKuwait. Land forces in excess, of brigade strength, with their heavy equipment, were gathered from a wide area and landed by sea and air with9
great speed. This operation showed that the mobile forces we are nowbuilding up are well fitted for their task. These include one Commandoship (H.M.S. Bulwark) in commission; another, H.M.S. Albion, is commis-sioning in July. These ships will normally carry a fighting force of 750 menconsisting of a Royal Marine Commando and its associated battery of theRoyal Artillery, the vehicles and equipment necessary to support them in operations ashore, a squadron of helicopters and four Assault Landing Craft.In emergency each ship could carry some 1,200 men. In addition, theAmphibious Warfare Squadron, now stationed in the Middle East, willcontinue to be available to lift heavy equipment and discharge it at thebeachhead. The ships of this squadron will be replaced by a new type ofAssault ship with improved capacity and speed; the ordering of the first of these ships has already been announced and the Government have now decided that a second will be ordered in the course of the financial year. Inaddition the first of a new class of logistic ship (the L.S.L.) is being laid downthis year for the Army. Air cover for a task force of this kind will be providedby a carrier, and a cruiser will also normally be available providing gun support and the capacity to carry further Army troops or Royal Marines. Similarly, the effectiveness of the present long-range transport fleet of the Royal Air Force(Britannias and Comet IIs) which can carry, in a single lift, about half a brigade equipped at light scales, will be steadily increased by the addition ofnew aircraft. The Comet IV is now entering service and orders have beenplaced for the VC-10 and the Belfast. Argosies are now being delivered to reinforce the Medium Range Transport Force. A small force of mobile lightbomber and fighter squadrons is also always available to reinforce the RoyalAir Force overseas and to accompany the strategic reserve forces if required.The Royal Air Force also proposes to reinforce its strategic transport forcein times of emergency by chartering civil aircraft as necessary.24. Development of equipment, doctrines and techniques for mobileforces calls for a high degree of inter-Service co-ordination. This requirementhas so far been met by the Land/Air Warfare Committee and by AmphibiousWarfare Headquarters. These two organisations are now to be replaced by anew Joint Service Staff in the Ministry of Defence under a senior officer as director, which will serve a committee comprising representativesof the Naval, General, Air and Defence Staffs under the chairmanship of the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, responsible to the Chiefsof Staff. This new organisation will be charged with advising the Chiefs ofStaff on all aspects of joint Service operations including training. In recentyears, experience has been gained by combined exercises overseas, amongstwhich one in North Africa in 1959 and one in 1960, as well as one in the arabian Peninsula and another in Borneo in 1961, were the more important.This form of joint exercise will continue on an increasing scale in order togive further experience in joint operations and maintain a British presencewherever this may be necessary.25. Outside Europe, our forces will essentially become joint Service taskforces using the air and the sea to transport men and equipment and to supportoperations conducted ashore. The reinforcement potential provides us withforces of all arms, capable of application anywhere in the world within amatter of days.   We must accustom ourselves to thinking in terms of the10
The Royal Navy26. The ability to assure free movement by sea at the right time and place remains of fundamental importance to these islands; indeed the seamay in certain circumstances be the one open highway for strategic movementfree of international political hindrance. To discharge this responsibilitywe &quot;need a balanced and versatile Fleet capable of bringing force to bearunder the sea, on the surface and in the air. By the use of task forces witha significant amphibious capability, seaborne military and air power can beexerted wherever our interests require it, to preserve or if necessary to restorepeace. The areas of our most vital interests to-day may not all be the samein a few years&apos; time. The great assets of seaborne power are its mobilityand flexibility, which enable it to be redeployed and concentrated whereverour policies require. A continuing need will be for effective and up to dateanti-submarine forces and equipment.27. During the next ten years or so, we may expect the Navy to be basedon the present balanced Fleet, though with a turnover to nuclear power forsubmarines, and some further emphasis on afloat support to supplement ourshore bases and increase flexibility. Seaborne task forces will includecommando ships and assault ships specially designed to carry, land andsustain, or if necessary to hold poised at sea a striking force of troops withtheir tanks, guns and logistic backing; frigates and guided missile ships, for anti-submarine and air defence; and aircraft carriers with highly versatileaircraft capable of long-range reconnaissance and strike, air defence, and close support for the Army. The new Buccaneer strike aircraft is now insquadron service and the first squadron will embark in H.M.S. Ark Royallater this year. The first of our guided missile destroyers, whose armamentincludes Seaslug and Seacat missiles, will commission this year. TheseCounty-class destroyers are of revolutionary design and the most up to dateof their type in the world. Looking further ahead, existing aircraft carrierswill be coming to the end of their lives, starting with H.M.S. Victorious in about 1970. It is difficult to forecast with certainty what our requirements for this type of ship ten to fifteen years ahead will be. Clearly any newgeneration of carriers would have to be designed primarily for the role of support of amphibious and land operations. They would also have to havea range of aircraft common to the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force sothat they could be operated either from carriers or from shore bases. As it takes no less than nine years to plan, build and work up a carrier, theGovernment have decided to put the necessary design work in hand.The Army -     -.28.   We shall continue to allot a substantial force to NATO.  The British -Army of the Rhine is trained and equipped to use both conventional and nuclear weapons.   Its organisation, equipment and deployment may varyto suit the tactical doctrine of the time but it will continue to form an11total required strengths of the joint Service armed forces. The identity andloyalties of the three Services must be retained but the present high degree ofco-operation will necessarily be increased.
essential part of the NATO shield forces.   In other overseas theatres, the;Army will continue to provide the garrisons which are still. essential tothe security of our bases and certain dependent territories and will, in addition,maintain mobile and well equipped forces at bases in the Arabian Peninsulaand Singapore to support our treaty obligations in these areas.29. The changing political circumstances outlined above will stress theimportance of the Strategic Reserve in the United Kingdom. This will bemaintained as a mobile force, trained to move by air or sea at short notice to reinforce BAOR or any other overseas theatre. The Army will increasinglybe trained to be ready to fight in widely differing types of terrain and climateand thus become accustomed to rapid changes of environment. Over theperiod the Army will be completely re-equipped with its new family of weapons. During the next two years it will take into service more of theMalkara wire-guided anti-tank missile; Wombat, an anti-tank gun; and ageneral purpose machine gun. They will be followed among other items of equipment by a new heavy tank, the Chieftain, already on order, and an improved wire-guided anti-tank missile, Vigilant.The Royal Air Force30. The Royal Air Force provides our main nuclear strategic strikingpower. It is responsible for shore based air defence at home and overseas and provides tactical strike as well as close support and reconnaissance forland forces. It undertakes the strategic, tactical and short-range airliftto move the Army and its supplies, and operates the maritime aircraft whichco-operate with the Royal Navy in the anti-submarine role.31. The British contribution to Western strategic nuclear power willcontinue to be the responsibility of the V-bomber force of Vulcans andVictors. Similarly we shall continue to contribute improved tactical strike and reconnaissance aircraft equipped for nuclear or conventional warfareto NATO, CENTO and SEATO. The TSR-2 which is planned to come into service in the mid-sixties will make an important contribution in this role.32. The growing emphasis on air mobility as an essential requirement for our strategy is being matched by an increase in both the carrying capacity and speed of our air transport force. New types of aircraft coming into service are the Comet IV and the Argosy, with the Belfast coming along alittle later, and orders have been placed for the VC-10 [and Herald Avro 748]for long [and short] range transport. In the helicopter range the Whirlwindand the Belvedere are already in service, and orders have been placed for theWessex.&apos; &apos;        - - &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;--*.33. In future we look to vertical take-off and landing and other advancedtechniques to increase the capacity of tactical and transport aircraft to operate in close co-operation with the Army in the field in the absence, if need be,of any but rudimentary facilities. It is intended that future generations ofvertical take-off and landing aircraft (V.T.O.L.) for the Royal Air Force shallbe capable of operating from the carriers of the day. Further ahead we have in hand studies on the possibilities of using space for communications and reconnaissance. ,. -12
Manpower34. In 1957 the decision was taken to abandon conscription, on which wehad relied since 1939, and to rely entirely on voluntary forces. It is sometimesasked why it is that we are almost the only NATO country which can afford to do without national service. Our decision was not so much a departure from the past as a reversion to our normal well tried practice. This country,an island with world-wide interests, has always needed long-service men inbalanced sea, land, and (more recently) air forces. Balance and mobilityhave been as important for us as numerical strength. Although our directinvolvement on the mainland of Europe has increased and our other overseas commitments have diminished, this fundamental importance to us of balanceand mobility remains.35. To discharge our world-wide responsibilities effectively we mustbe able to bring to bear, at very short notice, forces which are in all respectsready to fight. This can only be done with highly trained, well equippedformations with great long range mobility. In all three Services the degreeof individual professional skill which is required to play an adequate partin such operations, with our highly complex modern equipment, is very high.The same men must also be able to fight in a European theatre battle. It is our view that a period of conscription cannot be long enough both to enablethe necessary state of training for all these tasks to be reached, and also to yield a worth-while term of service thereafter.36. In 1957 certain broad assumptions were made about the size of theregular forces we should need. The trends described in earlier paragraphsshow that our requirements are unlikely to increase. An appraisal of service manpower over the next five to ten years shows that the broad plan devisedin 1957 was soundly based, and that the numbers we can obtain by voluntary recruitment will be adequate for our strategy in the future.37. The Governmenfs five-year plan to replace the National Servicesystem with all regular forces will be completed by the end of this year.These forces will be highly trained both technically and professionally and well equipped. The Government intend to keep their pay and conditions ofservice under regular review.38. The size of the forces we intend to maintain in peacetime must, ifnational resources are not to be wasted, be related to peacetime needs.They will in any case require some 50 per cent, of the total Defence budget for their pay, clothing, maintenance, etc. If as may happen from time totime in the present state of relations between the Great Powers tension risesto a point beyond that which the peacetime forces can deal with, we musthave a reliable means of strengthening them at short notice. Such a situation has developed over Berlin and the Government have thought it essential asa short-term measure to take powers to retain some&apos; of the existing national Servicemen in the Army for an additional six months&apos; full-time service. As a longer term measure we need a reserve of trained men-whoare willing to be called up for a limited time whenever the government consider it necessary. This is the purpose of the Territorial Army EmergencyReserve.  An examination of the whole reserve system is in hand.13
Organisation of the Services39. Increasing stress will be laid on interchangeability of functions and mutual support and assistance between the three Services, so that we get thebest value out of our Service manpower as a whole. Where necessary changes will be made over the next few years to secure an orderly process ofevolution to complete the concept laid down in the White Paper on theCentral Organisation for Defence (Cmnd. 476) of July 1958. The purpose isnot to revolutionise the organisation of the forces but rather to secureco-operation and greater economy. The separate tasks, weapons and organisation which differentiate the &quot; teeth &quot; elements of the three Servicesoperate also to separate their support services. Nevertheless, in many of theadministrative and support functions of the Services the similarities outweigh the differences and there may well be scope for further rationalisation in theinterests of efficiency and economy both of money and manpower. No singlemethod of bringing these similar functions into closer relationship will suitall cases. One of the most useful methods is likely to be the agency arrange-ment under which one Service acts for the other two. Much has alreadybeen accomplished by this means. For example, the supply of food, petrol,oil and lubricants is organised on these lines in many areas in the UnitedKingdom and overseas. The Medical Services also operate agencyarrangements on a large scale. Thus in Germany, Gibraltar, East Africa,North Africa, Hong Kong, and Mala)&apos;a the Army provides practically allthe hospital services needed by the other two. In particular cases some formof integration may be desirable, e.g., on the lines of the administration of services hospitals in the United Kingdom. These remain under the individual services, but the total number of beds is related to the total Servicepopulation: a serviceman can be admitted to the nearest hospital irrespective of the Service to which he belongs; and drugs and other medical supplies arecentrally procured. It is intended to integrate the long-range communicationssystems of the three Services. As a first essential step towards this a commonsignals procedure is being evolved which will enable the signals organisationof all three Services to work more readily on an interchangeable basis.40. Because the needs of each Service and function are so diverse eachof them will need separate examination and if changes are needed a form of organisation will have to be devised to meet each case. An inter-service committee, under the Ministry of Defence, has been established for thepurpose and progress is being made.41. It has been decided as a result of a full examination to introduceofficers to joint Service problems earlier than in the past by increasing theamount of Joint Service Training not only at the individual Staff Colleges, butalso by laying greater emphasis on joint Service exercises, lectures and discussions.The Ministry of Defence42. The Governments intention is that the Ministry of Defence should remain a relatively small Ministry, charged with the formulation of policy,the execution of operations and the allocation of defence expenditure. Itshould also co-ordinate, through the Chiefs of Staff and the Defence Research14
Policy and other Committees, the development of weapons and weaponssystems. The administration and day-by-day management of the individualarmed forces must continue to be carried out by the Service Ministries. Whendecisions on operational matters are required by Commanders overseas, theyare given by the Minister of Defence with the advice of the Chiefs of Staff.As a result of experience gained arrangements have been made to set up asmall operational staff that is always at immediate readiness to man the war room in the Ministry of Defence on a joint-Service basis.Command Arrangements43. In order to meet our commitments in the world outside Europe, it isnot enough to provide our forces with the necessary mobility equipment andbase facilities. Command arrangements must also be streamlined to allowunified control to be exercised over tri-Service operations. The unified command in the Middle East (with its Headquarters in Aden) was set up withthese considerations in mind. The handling of recent operations put the unified command to a test which amply proved that there are valuableadministrative advantages to be derived from the unified command system.For these reasons, the Government have now decided to introduce unified command in the Far East as soon as practicable. The future arrangementsfor command of our forces in the Near East have been reviewed in the lightof the adjustments to those forces described in paragraph 17. It has beendecided that the present Unified Command Headquarters in Cyprus will nolonger be required in its present form and that the Army Headquarters canbe reduced in size. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief will become responsible for all British forces.Research and Development44. With general strategy settled for the period ahead we shall be ableto form a much clearer view of the arms and equipment that we shall needand of the research and development programme required to produce them.At the same time, the main recommendations of a Committee which hasrecently reported on the management and control of research and development,in so far as they concern the control of defence research and development,have been put into effect. While all encouragement continues to be given to members of Government establishments, and also to research workers in industry, to pursue new ideas in the early stages of implementing operational requirements and devising new weapons, we have now instituted check points in the process of development so that no major development contract properwill be placed until a fully evaluated project study has been completed. the project study includes a detailed examination of the scientific and technical problems which need to be resolved and the preparation of a detaileddevelopment programme in terms of technical manpower, cost and time.-45. New ideas for research and development in the field of defence are,being generated continuously in all the countries of Western Alliance, no single member of which can afford to exploit the whole range of possibilitiesnow that we have moved into an era of immense technological complexitycharacterised by ballistic missiles and space technology. For this reason weare strengthening all measures to achieve interdependence in research and15
development both in NATO and within the Commonwealth. Only in thisway will it be possible to spread the load and economise in scarce scientific and technological resources. We ourselves will concentrate our effort in those areas in which we can hope to make the most valuable contribution to western defence as a whole. Good examples of the kind of interdependenceat which we are aiming are the joint programme that has been agreed withthe German Federal Republic and the United States to evaluate the BritishP-1127 V.T.O.L./S.T.O.L. fighter aircraft and to develop the Pegasus engine,and the tripartite agreement with the Federal Republic and France to develop the Rolls Royce lightweight lifting engine which should have important implications for vertical take off.Civil Defence46. Over the next five to ten years it is clear that Civil Defence will play an important part in maintaining the general preparedness of the whole nationfor any emergency, and will itself form part of the deterrent. In the report on defence for 1961 it was stated that the Government had reviewed HomeDefence plans and concluded that some additional expenditure was needed to secure a balanced programme over the next few years. These plans haveto cover a wide field, and are an integral part of our defence preparations.Departments are actively engaged in implementing a revised programme.Next year will be its second year, and the estimated defence expenditureof civil departments will be  19 37 million compared with  18 61 million for the current year.47. Among the preparations which will be advanced, the scheme ofemergency control will be further developed, and emergency radio communi-cations will be provided. For the warning and monitoring organisation, anew system for rapidly passing messages over the telephone is being installed,arrangements are being made for the B.B.C. to supplement other warningchannels, and a start is being made with the provision of special equipment and radio communications. Stocks of emergency equipment for maintainingdrinking water supplies are being increased. Stockpiling of radiacinstruments for essential services will continue, and further training equipment will be provided for the Civil Defence Corps and the Auxiliary Fire Service.48. There have been a number of joint civil/military exercises in orderto test plans for military aid to the civil power, and joint planning for thispurpose is continuing.49. An examination of the functions and organisation of the Civil DefenceCorps and the Auxiliary Fire Service has been carried out, and the Govern-ment now propose to discuss with the local authority. Associations certain changes designed to make the Corps and the Auxiliary Fire Service better able to discharge their role. The strength of these Services on 31st december last was over 395,000 compared with just under 380,000 on the correspondingdate in 1960.50. The Government have reviewed dispersal policy in the light of developments in the strategic situation over recent years, and have hadconsultations with the local authority Associations.   They have concluded16
that although the circumstances that might precede an attack upon us cannotbe foreseen, it is necessary to have available a scheme which could be implemented, if it were thought right to do so, for dispersing mothers andchildren and other people in &quot;priority classes&quot; from major centres of population. The detailed application of the scheme will be worked out withthe help of local authorities.CONCLUSION51. To have at least in outline a long-term plan is essential if the best use is to be made of manpower and resources. No settled weapons policyis possible in a short time-scale. This White Paper however does not attempt to set out the details of strategy and weapon systems over theperiod.  This will be done each year in the individual Service memoranda.17
