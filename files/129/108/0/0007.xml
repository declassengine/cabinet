1.CONFIDENTIALINCOMES   POLICY &apos; &apos;Letter from the Chancellor uf the. exchequer to the Chairman of the Economic Committee of the T.U.C.1.    I promised that I would send to you as quickly as i could a paper which might, form a basis for continuing our discussion of last Friday, 5th January.The Objectives2.    My purpose as Chancellor Is to promote economicvitality and strength in this country sufficient to enable us to carry out our international responsibilities for defence and aid to less developed countries, but als-ssufficient to provide a continuing, broadly spread,improvement in the standard of living of all.sections ofthe community. .3.    To achieve that result, certain tilings are necessary.Our export trade depends upon our goods being competitive,in other words upon our costs being such that our prices are attractive to overseas purchasers.    Upon our ability to export depends in turn the balance of paynents.    Unlessthat is satisfactory we cannot have the soundly basedgrowth in cur economy which is essential.
Personal Incomes4.    The largest single factor in all this is the rateof increase in personal incomes.    Since the War therehas been a persistent tendency for money incomes to grow faster than the volume of national production.For example, &quot;between 1953 and 1960 incomes from employment and from profits both rose more than twiceas fast as production.     I start therefore with what i regard as the basic proposition.    Unless increases in personal incomes of all kinds are kept broadly in line with increases in production, our objectives ofsustained growth and higher standards cannot be attained,July Measures5.    The unsatisfactory prospects for our balance ofpayments caused a major loss of confidence in sterling in the summer.    The measures which I introduced on25th July were partly short term and partly long term.They did not single out any particular section of thecommunity. &quot; \2.COMFSDEMTIAL
3.CONFIDENTIALAlthough public attention has been centred on the-paypause, it was only one element in a comprehensivenational approach.    To relieve the strain on the balanceof payments the following measures were taken which affected a wide range of people in all walks of life:(1)   OverseasCurtailment of Government   diplomatic andmilitary expenditure.Tightening up of exchange control overprivate investment of capital in non-sterling countries.A request that a greater proportion of^companies&apos; overseas earnings should be repatriated.(2)   At HomeRestrictions, on public expenditure.Increased taxes on consumption throughthe use of the Customs and Excise surcharge.Tightening of credit by a 2 per cent,increase in Bank Rate, a call for Special&apos;&quot;&apos;.Deposits, a request to the banks and theinsurance companies to be severe in dealingwith applications for loans to financepersonal consumption and speculation.(3)   Diyid^ends,.,.and,. Prof;its.A request for dividend restraint.A commitment to tax certain short-term gains,now trgatod as capital and therefore -outside the tax net.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL6.    In addition I pointed the way to means of tacklingthe long term problems.     I referred to the steps whichthe Government had already taken to improve the coordinationof long term programmes in the public sector, and I suggested that the time had come for closer consultation between the Government and both sides of industry aboutnational economic development.    This led to the proposalfor a National Economic Development Council which we have discussed together on several occasions, and about T.U.C.participation in which I still av/ait your reply.    MeanwhileI have appointed Sir Robert Shone to be Director Generalof the staff of the Council.&apos;7.    This paper is primarily concerned with incomes.That problem is immediate and must be tackled now.    ButI cannot let pass the opportunity of emphasising to youonce again my belief in the importance of the work of thisN.E.D. Council and the great opportunity which it. providesfor the two sides of industry to influence policy, bo tacklein cooperation with the Government the obstacles to soundgrowth, and to consider with us the availability and useor misuse of resources.     I ask you once again, as a body which has consistently urged upon me the advantages of suchcoordination of economic effort, to join in this work.When the Council is established I. will place before it papers on the prospects of the United Kingdom economyfor the next five years, and on the problems of economic-growth and national efficiency, and will suggest that aslone of its early actions the Council should instruct its ,I 4.CONFIDENTIAL
staff, in collaboration with the main industries, toexamine the long-term prospects of these industries, theirrequirementpfor investment and skilled, manpower and theirexpectations m to production and exports.   The, resultsvwouldthen be correlated with each other and with- the Government&apos;plans for the public sector, to provide a basis for future action.National Incomes policy.     I have also stated for example in the House of commons on 18th December, that I am convinced of the need for theGovernment to try to work out with both sides of industry a. long term policy to keep increases in money incomes in line with the increase in national production.9.    A necessary part of any such policy will be theGovernment&apos;s responsibility, by use of fiscal and monetarymeasures, to ensure that excessive demand in the home marketdoes not drive up prices, prevent the growth of exports andattract a greater quantity of imports than we can afford.If arrangements cannot be made for keeping the. total growth of incomes in a proper relationship to the total growth ofproduction, the Government will be forced to act in otherways.    The stark truth is that the alternative to an incomes policy is further restriction of demand with loss of economic growth and with higher levels of unemployment than would otherwise be the case.    But I should much prefer to bethinking in terms of the sound growth which would ease thesolution of so many of our problems.10.   I would like to set out again in this paper what seemto me to be necessary elements in any long term incomes policy.
The Elements of a Long-Term PolicyII.   First of all there must be a common understanding&apos;ofour economic problems and prospects.     Here theN.E.D.C. could prove of the greatest value.12.     Secondly, we must improve public unstanding of the fact that increases in the total of money wages and salaries above a certain point are self-defeatingbecause they put up prices.     It is often thought that increases in wages and salaries do not matter becausethey are offset by reductions in profits.     There isno evidence to show that in a community enjoying high levels of employment, wage increases come out of theprofits;   indeed since the war, wage-costs and profitshive gone up broadly in lino.13.    Thirdly, all those who influence or decide thecourse of wages and salaries, whether by negotiation,arbitration or in other ways, or who determine profit margins, dividends and prices have a special responsibility.     They must recognise that in the longrun all will suffer if sectional interests are allowed to  .prevail over the interests of the community as a whole.Just as important, they and the general public must beJkept informed about the country&apos;s economic circumstancesland prospects in such a way that not only thoseor decision[Immediately concerned with a particular negotiation^ butkhe community as a whole are able to judge what effector decisionm particular settlement/will have on the national economy,fee impact of such information would be increased if itIfanie from a body such as the National Economic6.CONFSDEMTIAL
Development Council enjoying the support of both sides of industry and the Government.14.    Finally, I recognise that wage and salary earnerscannot be expected to accept the restraint in v/age and salary increases needed to keep rises in incomes within reasonable limits, if those who benefit from profitsare,subject to no such restraint.     If, therefore, it was established that aggregate profits were increasingdisproportionately as compared with wages and salaries,the Government would not hesitate to take correctiveaction in the fiscal or other fields.     I should, however,make it clear that no Government which seeks toincrease productivity and growth can contemplateimposing a uniform limit on/profits or dividends of individual concerns.     Such a limit would penalisegrowing and enterprising concerns and industries andimpair their ability to get the capital they need for expansion, while it would leave inefficient andstagnating concerns unaffected.The present situation15.    The &quot;pause&quot;&apos; has achieved a considerable&apos; effect inrestraining costs at a time when it was particularly important they should be restrained.,    The full effectof this restraint on our international competitivepositier   has yet to be seen.   But what has been gainedcould easily be thrown away if the &quot;pause&apos;1 were followedby a phase of large and widespread increases in incomes.But, if this does not happen, we have now an excellentprospect for a movement in comparative cost levels ofa kind favourable tovthis country.&apos;   It mustthe7.CONFSDNTIAL
be remembered that when a country needs to increase itsexports sharply, it is likely to have to accept less .favourable prices than if it merely wishes ta keep pace with other countries.    Largely because of the loss of income from invisibles and an increasing contribution tothe development of other countries, we have a largeadverse balance to wipe out and we are not likely to do this without a further substantial increase in ourvisible exports.16.    A national incomes policy must take a considerable time to work out.      Meanwhile the Government hope thatit will be possible to gain the support of both sides ofIndustry for intermediate arrangements to replace the&quot;pause&quot; in its present form by the end of this financialyear.    This would make It possible to give effect to the increases granted since July 1961, for Implementation froma date tc be decided by the Government; to put the M-ratereview into effect;   and to grant those -parts ofarbitration awards that had been held in suspense.Intermediate: arrangements17.     In existing circumstances large sums will not be&quot;&apos;-available for increases in personal incomes during 1962.Until we can tackle together the obstacles to sound economic growth, and produce results, large increases in wages and salaries are bound to result in inflation. In other words,the increases will not be real in terms of purchasing-power.     Therefore the Government must give guidance tothose responsible;   they intend to do so after consultations with both sides of industry and bearing in mind anyadvice received.     They would, of course, prefer to giveguidance which has the general support of both sides ofindustry.
18.    Against the background of the estimate,which myadvisers have given me of an increase in&apos; production during1962 of about 2i per cent, various possibilities havebeen suggested:-(a) The Government and both sides of industry should accept an understanding that the overall rate of increase in wages and .salaries in 1962 should be kept within astated figure.    This must also provide forthe exceptional cases where there aresustainable claims for special treatment..It must also be realised that some industries cannot afford any increases ata.11, if they are to remain competitive.(b) The. Government and b vth sides of industry should accept the fact that only alimited sum can without Inflationaryeffects be distributed by way of wagesand salaries during 1962.    Out of thatsum must come the increases for 1962already agreed, and any exceptionalsettlements.(c) The Government and both sides of industry should examine the feasibility of devisinga formula which would do justice to thosein employments where productivity cannotbe measured, while taking some account ofactual increases in productivity where theycan be ascertained.
19.    Each of these courses has certain disadvantages.Under course (a), the percentage stated migftt he regarded as the minimum in each case and not an overall maximum.    Under course (b), there might be thefeeling of &quot;first come first served&quot;, and an acceleration of claims.    Under course (c), there might be difficulty and protracted argument about the&apos;formula.   I should like your views where the balanceof advantage lies.20.     I certainly do not intend that restraint in 1962should be limited to wages and salaries.    But grosscompany profits before taxation amounted to  1,679 million in the second and third quarters of 1961, that is,slightly less than in the corresponding period of1959 and II- per cent, less than in the first half of1960.     It should be remembered that company profits nowbear a rate of taxation of 53-1 per cent, as a result of increases in profits tax in two successive Budgets.Ordinary dividends, before taxation, represent only 7 per cent, of wages and salaries -and, becauseinvestment incomes are more heavily taxed than earnedincomes, dividends after taxation represent an evensmaller proportion of net wages and salaries.    Furthermorethe rate of increase of dividends has recently fallensharply.     Nevertheless the position as to profits and dividends must be carefully watched to see that because of wage restraint they do not improve their relative&apos; position.    Lastly, in this context, it shouldbe remembered that I have taken the exceptional step ofcommitting myself in advance to the introduction of a tax on short-term gains not now subject to tax,10.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL21.    I have been dealing v/ith the intermediate phase.For the long term the real answer is to get a rate of soundgrowth which can carry reasonable increases.    By soundgrowth, I mean growth which is not based.on inflation.As I have stated, I believe this to be possible with- co-operation, but if we are not to ruin our chances ofobtaining that sound growth, increases in 1962 in personal incomes must be kept within the increases in national production.    If that is not done, there will be inflation and I shall be driven to further restrictive measures.We must also face the fact that if the pause is ended andwe revert to pre-pause practice, the increases m incomes in 1962 will not be kept within the increase in national production.22.    To sum up I wish, with the help of both sides ofindustry, to replace the pay pause in its present formwith suitable intermediate arrangements.    But I am equally-,anxious to proceed as rapidly as possible with a combinedeffort to increase the real wealth of the country.    i therefore consider it highly important to make&quot;earlyprogress with the setting up of an effective national economic Development Council,I would be grateful for your views on the suggestionsset out above and for any other advice which you have togive to me, as soon as convenient to you,10,1.1962T,16-62
