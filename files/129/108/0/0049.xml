Since the discussion in Cabinet (C. C.(62) 19th Conclusions,Minute 6), when it was decided to reduce the guaranteed price for milk by 0.4d. per gallon and to secure savings of   8 million on other commodities, I have thought further whether we could not, within thelimits set, make the award rather more balanced and constructive.3. In consultation with my Agricultural colleagues and the other ministers most directly concerned, I have come to the conclusion thatour award this year should include an extension of the upper limit ofthe Small Farmer Scheme;  the cost of this to be offset by a reductionin the fertiliser subsidy.4. These changes will improve the award and give it a betterlook.     Without them our decisions would have been open to the criticism that we had concentrated in a negative way on price cuts rather thanconstructive help.     We shall also be the better able to rebut the likelycharge that we are favouring the large farmers at the expense of thesmaller men who are especially dependent on milk and eggs.5. I shall be announcing the Determination on Thursday,15th March, after Questions and will be telling the House at the sametime of our decision on the general milk subsidy.C.S.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.

.  ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION OF    &quot;GUARANTEES, 19621. The 1962 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has been held in accordance with the Agriculture &apos;Act, 1947.I. Economic condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production2. Agricultural net output continues to increase. On the index of net output introduced at the 1960 Annual Review (1954/55 to 1956/57=100),the forecast for 1961/62 is 122 compared with revised figures of 119 for1960/61 and 112 for 1959/60. On the old index based on pre-war as 100,the forecast of net output for 1961/62 is 183 compared with the revisedfigure of 178 for last year.3. The wet weather in the autumn and winter of 1960 gave way toexcellent spring sowing and planting conditions. Although the acreageof most crops was reduced, growth was generally good and yields satis-factory. On the other hand, the output of some horticultural crops,particularly top fruit, was low though producers benefited from consequen-tially high prices-. The output of livestock products generally, which account for nearly two-thirds of total agricultural output, has risen during the current year: fatstock, milk, eggs and poultry have all shown substantial increases.Tillage operations for next season&apos;s crops are well advanced.Changes in Income4. At the time of the last Review it was thought that the exceptionallywet weather in the preceding autumn and winter would adversely affectnet income in 1961/62 and the Government took this into account in assess-!ing the prospects of the industry. In fact, however, the forecast of theindustry&apos;s actual net income for the current year (to 31st May, 1962) isnow. 431-1 million, compared with a revised estimate for 1960/61 of 389^ million. On the basis of normal weather conditions, the forecast for 1961/62 is  413-J million. This is  26\ million more than the revised estimate for last year of  387 million, which was itself a record figure.Costs and Efficiency5. The cost of goods and services used in agriculture has risen byabout the same amount as last year, due principally to increases in wages,rents and machinery expenses. The net increase for Review commoditiesis about  19\ million. On the other hand, the efficiency of the industrycontinues to increase and a figure of  25 million can continue to be taken as an indication of the amount which, taking one year with another, theindustry may expect to gain through increasing efficiency on Reviewcommodities.Cost of Agricultural Support6. There has been a marked increase in the cost to the Exchequer ofagricultural support, details of which are given in Appendix V. In 1960/61it was  263 million. In 1961/62 it is expected to be  351 million. On thebasis of no change in the level of the guarantees, the estimated cost in1962/63 is  339 million.
II. Determination of GuaranteesLong-term Assurances7. In accordance with the Agriculture Act, 1957, the present aeterrnina-tions must be such that the total value of the guarantees* in the coming year, minus the amount of the net cost increase that has occurred onguaranteed commodities since the 1961 Annual Review, is not less than97J per cent, of their total value in 1961/62. In addition the guaranteed price for each commodity must be maintained at not less than 96 per cent,of the corresponding price determined after the 1961 Annual Review ; and,for livestock and livestock products, ait not less than 91 per cent, of thecorresponding price determined after the 1959 Annual Review.8. The total value of the guarantees in 1961/62 was about  1,351^million and 97  per cent, of this is  1,318 million, making a difference of 33  million. From this must be subtracted the relevant cost increase ofabout  19-J million, so the lower limit for the Governmenfs determina-tions is a reduction of about  14 million in the total value of the guarantees.Milk9. Output of milk continues to increase both because of the increasingsize of the datky herd and the upward trend of milk yields. As a result,sales of milk to the Milk Marketing Boards are expected to be 2,430 million gallons in 1961/62. This is about 100 million gallons more than in 1960/61,and a further substantial increase is expected in 1962/63. The dairy industry has again succeeded in increasing sales for liquid consumption, which have risen by over 24 million gallons to a total of about 1,580 million gallonsin 1961. This increase will be taken into account in the standard quantityon which the guarantee is based. But production is rising much faster thanliquid consumption and consequently the pool price to (the producercontinues to fall.10. An increase of 0-8d. per gallon in the guaranteed price was awardedat the 1961 Review, in anticipation that a satisfactory scheme would be devised which would bring home to individual producers that output beyond certain level was not in their interest unless it could be produced profitablyat the price at which milk not required for liquid consumption can, be soldfor manufactaring. The industry has not as yet found an alternative to thepresent arrangements. The Government made lit clear that, if a suitablesystem could not be devised and introduced, they   would be bound to reconsider at the 1962 Annual Review the increase given in 1961. TheGovernment have decided, after taking account of the fact that the expected increase in production will, in itself, reduce the pool price, not to removethis year more than half of last year&apos;s increase. The guaranteed price will,therefore, be reduced by 0-4d. per gallon.11. This means that the average guaranteed price for the standard quantity of milk will be 3s. l-85d. per gallon. There remains the problemfacing the industry of a continuing reduction in the pool price per gallon* The total value of the guarantees is the sum of (i) the value of the price guarantees(calculated for each commodity by multiplying the guaranteed price by the quantity of outputqualifying for the guarantee) and (ii) the value of the relevant production grants.
actually received by farmers so long as milk producers taken as a wholecontinue to increase production above the standard quantity. . .Fat Cattle t12. There has been a considerable increase in home production of beeftin 1961/62, and the decline in the number of calves retained for beef production, which was referred to dn the 1961 Annual Review White Paper(Cmnd. 1311), now appears to have been arrested. Total supplies of beef(including imports) in 1961/62 will be slightly higher than in the previous year, in spite of a net reduction in imports. There is likely to be a furthersmall increase in home production of beef in 1962/63, but the prospects are that output will level off thereafter.13. An abnormal pattern of marketing accompanied the increase in home production, and there was some deterioration in quality. As a result,market prices have been low, particularly at certain times of the year. TheGovernment have decided to raise -the general standard at which cattle willbe accepted for the guarantee. A new standard will also be introduced toenable young beasts of good conformation to become eligible at a weightlower &quot;than the general minimum. The maximum weights on which guaranteepayments are. made will be reduced and a further reduction will be considered at the 1963 Annual Review. The stabilising limits will be widened to 10s.per cwt. on either side of the weekly standard price. There will be nochange in the guaranteed price.Fat Pigs14. Output of pigmeat, which fell slightly in 1960/61, made a markedrecovery in 1961/62. The breeding herd continues to expand, but the rateof increase is now lessening. Under the flexible guarantee arrangementintroduced at the last Review to promote a steadier rate of production,the guaranteed price is adjusted periodically by reference to a forecast of the number &apos;0f pigs expected to receive the guarantee payment in a12-month period. In February, 1962, the forecast level of certifications was between 10-8 million and 11 million, which involved an automatic reductionof 6d. per score in the basic guaranteed price. A further automatic reductionof 6d. per score will be made if the forecast reaches 11 million. The Govern-ment have decided to&apos; make no change in the basic guaranteed price or inthe guarantee arrangements.Fat Sheep and Wool15. Output of mutton and lamb in 1961/62 is expected to be about 10 percent, above the previous year&apos;s record level. The high rate of marketings,coupled with the general weakness of the meat market, has kept market prices very low and the unit rate of subsidy is running at about 60 per cent,of market value, the highest rate for any guaranteed commodity. There hasalso been a further increase in the breeding flock, so the prospect for thecoming year must be one of continuing low market prices. The Governmenthave decided to reduce the guaranteed price by Id. per lb. In addition, themaximum weights on which guarantee payments are made will be reducedto encourage marketing at the weights in strongest demand, and specifically to discourage retention of animals to heavy weights for the sake of the
guarantee. The stabilising limits will be widened to 3d. per lb. on either side of the weekly standard price. No change is being made in the guaranteed price of wool.Eggs16. The 1961/62 output of hen eggs is likely to be nearly 5 per cent,above that of 1960/61 and slightly above the previous record level of pro-ductipn in 1959/60. Home production continues to meet virtually the wholeof the United Kingdom demand for shell eggs. Output in 1962/63 is againexpected to be significantly higher. Wholesale prices in 1961/62 will be lower than in 1960/61 and are expected to fall further in 1962/63. It is clearthat there is a danger of production exceeding demand. The Governmenthave therefore decided to reduce the guaranteed price for hen eggs by l d.per dozen. - .Cereals17. The increase in the acreage of barley has cohtinued and was accentuatedin 1961 by the limited sowing of wheat during the wet autumn of 1960. the acreage of oats and mixed corn has continued to fall, and the total cerealsacreage in 1961 has fallen below the high level of 1960. Yields were betterthan expected and those of wheat, barley and oats were all above the five-yearaverage. The wheat acreage is expected to recover in 1962, but the barleyacreage may not reach the record level of 1961. The decline in the acreageof oats and mixed conn will probably continue. Market prices have improved in recent months. In general, the present balance between the guaranteed prices for the various cereals seems satisfactory and the Government havedecided to make no change.Potatoes18. Planting conditions for the 1961 crop were difficult in some areas and the potato acreage fell from 829,000 acres in 1960 to 701,000 acres forthe 1961 crop. The yield has, however, been excellent. Prices received byproducers are well above the levels for the past two years. There is likelyto be an increase in plantings for the 1962 crop which should give, with normal yields, a crop sufficient to meet the requirements for human consumption-tion. The Government have decided to make no change in the guaranteed price.Sugar Beet19. To give further encouragement to the production of beet of highersugar content, which reduces costs both for producers and for the factories,the price differential for sugar content will be increased with effect fromthe 1963 crop. No change is being made in the guaranteed price or guarantee arrangements for the 1962 crop.Production Grants20. Small Farmer Scheme. The Small Farmer Scheme has so far been confined to farm businesses with a standard labour requirement of not morethan 450 man-days.. The Scheme is already doing much to improve theefficiency and profitability of some 40,000 farm businesses. The Governmenthave decided to increase the upper limit to 500 man-days, which will bringwithin the scope of the Scheme a further 13,000 farms. The acreage limitsremain unchanged.
21. Fertiliser Subsidy. Over the past three years the effects of reductions in the fertiliser subsidy have been more than offset by lower prices, and tiieamount of fertiliser used continues to increase. It has been decided to reducethe rates of subsidy from 1st July next, thereby reducing the total annualsubsidy by an estimated  2  million.22. Winter Keep and Grassland Renovation. Subject to legislative authority, the Government intend to introduce schemes for grants to encourage the production of winter keep in livestock rearing areas and the renovationof permanent grassland. Discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions are proceeding on proposals for these schemes, which would be linked with a revision of theexisting ploughing grants.Market Research and Development23. There is general agreement on the importance of, and need for,improved marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce. The maininitiative for this must come from the industry, but the Government wishto give encouragement to it. Proposals which were made to the Farmers&apos;Unions last year and briefly reported in the 1961 Annual Review white paper have been further discussed with the Unions, and the Governmentare now introducing an agreed new scheme of grants for research anddevelopment &apos;im marketing. These will be made in the first place for an experimental period of three years, up to a total of  1^ million, and will represent a small switch in Exchequer support from production tomarketing.24. The main purposes for which grant may be paid are:  (a) market research;(b) promotion of grading, standardization and better productpresentation;(c) investigation of reasons for defective and sub-standard produce ;(d) communication to producers of the findings and results of (a) to(c) above, and of other information on market requirements and how to satisfy them ;(e) promoting the business efficiency of local producers&apos; marketingorganisations ; and assisting the formation of new ones.25. The rate of grant will vary between 25 and 75 per cent., accordingto the nature and cost of the project, and should average about 50 per cent.The scheme will be administered through an Executive Committee, to be constituted by the Unions, which will have the initiative in making proposalsfor grant. The Unions will meet the administrative costs in full within a limit of  10,000 a year. The results of new investigations and researcheswill be published from time to time.III. Effect of Determinations26. This year&apos;s determinations, which are set out in detail in AppendixVI, result in a reduction of just under  11 million in the total value of the guarantees. This is necessary to secure the policy objectives for the maincommodities affected and takes account of the other considerations setout earlier in this paper.
; 27. In making the determinations the Government have three mainpurposes in mind. Firstly, to tackle the problems facing certain commodities-ties. Secondly, to give special help and encouragement to a further numberof small farmers who, because of their rather higher levels of cropping orstocking, have been outside the scope of the present Scheme. Finally, the- Government believe that one of the most important needs for farming isthe promotion of market development and research. The industry and itsleaders are rightly concentrating more and more effort in this direction;The Governments offer to contribute to a programme of market research and development has been accepted by the Farmers&apos; Unions, and it ishoped that this will give a valuable impetus to the industry&apos;s progress inmatching its products to the needs of the market.28. These determinations have been made in the context of our existing arrangements: they have not been influenced by the fact that negotiations are in progress between the United Kingdom and the European economic community. During these negotiations the Government will continue tokeep in close touch with the leaders of the industry. Whatever may be the outcome, there will be a new situation calling for constructive policies.The industry may be sure that the Government will then discuss fully withits leaders how these can best be shaped in the interests of an efficient andprosperous home agriculture.

The estimates of aggregate farming net income in Tables A and B arearrived at after making provision for depreciation. Net income can be defined asthe reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, andfor the use of the occupier&apos;s investment.Note (ii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There are anumber of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individual causes.Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.
Note (iii). The figures for aggregate npt income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  9 million on the production of food for consumption in the farmhousehold. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit andare relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent). &apos;  ,Note (iv). From the figures for aggregate net income in Table A certain sumsshould have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops, etc.)used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Od.Notes on Price Tables(a) The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and wheat are average pricessubject to variation seasonally; the guarantee payments for fat cattle and some fatpigs are subject to variation according to quality; and the method of calculatingfatstock guarantee payments involves an element of estimation. Because the market-ings of fatstock and wheat cannot be accurately forecast, producers&apos; average returnsunder the guarantees for those products in any year may be a little more or less thanthe guaranteed prices.(b) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee arrangementintroduced in 1961/62.(c) The prices guaranteed to the British Egg Marketing Board for hen and duckeggs are subject to profit and loss sharing arrangements in accordance with the termsof a financial agreement between the Government and the Board. They include an allowance for the Board&apos;s administrative costs in operating the guarantee arrangements and marketing expenses (including packers&apos; margins, packaging costs, transport and,in the case of hen eggs, certain trading losses).(d) The guaranteed price for barley is subject to arrangements whereby, to encourage a more even spread of marketings over the season, the deficiency payments are adjustedso that growers receive a h;gher rate of acreags payment for birley delivered, aftersale, in the later months of the cereal year than for barley delivered in the early months of the year.Part II. Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shown in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and live-stock products in 1962/63 and for crops of the 1962 harvest will be on a similar basis tothose for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Fat Cattle2. With effect from 26th March, 1962 the following standards of eligibilitywill apply:(a) Revised general minimum standard(i) If presented at a deadweight certification centre, the dressed carcase weightmust be not less than 450 lb. in the case of a steer and not less than 390 lb.in the case of a heifer. The carcase must be of good conformation, therounds, loins and ribs being reasonably well fleshed and the chucks andplates reasonably thick but the neck and foreshanks may be slightly longand thin. The Carcases of young animals of such conformation need have only a thin exterior fat covering. Carcases from older animals may possessa rather thicker fat covering but must not be excessively fat or patchy.
(ii) If presented at a liveweight certification centre, the animal must weigh notless than 1\ cwt.. in the case of a steer and not less than 6i cwt. in the caseof a heifer. It must have an estimated killing-out percentage of not lessthan 54 per cent, and must, in the opinion of the fatstock officer, be such asto produce a carcase of at least the standard specified above.i(b) New standard for young animals of special conformation(i) The animal must not have cut any permanent incisor teeth.(ii) If presented at a deadweight certification centre the dressed carcase weightmust.be not less than 430 lb. in the case of a steer and not less than 365 lb.in the case of a heifer. The carcase must be compact and heavily fleshedthroughout, rounds plump and loins, ribs and chucks thick, neck and shanksshort. Fat covering, which should be smooth and evenly distributed overthe exterior of the carcase, may vary in quantity from medium to light.Cod or udder, kidney and aitch fat should be adequate but not excessive.(iii) If presented at a liveweight certification centre, the animal must weigh notless than 7 cwt. in the case of a steer and not less than 6 cwt. in the case of aheifer. It must have an estimated killing-out percentage of not less than55 per cent, and must, in the opinion of the fatstock officer, be such as toproduce a carcase of at least the standard specified above.   &apos;(iv) An animal conforming with this standard will qualify for Grade I.3. Maximum weights. As in previous years there will be no upper limit to the weight at which live cattle or their carcases may be certified, but any guarantee payment will be restricted to the following weights:26th March, 1962        On and afterto 1st July, 1962       2nd July, 1962   .Steers and Heifers      Steers   HeifersLiveweight        ..      .. 15 cwt. 14 cwt.   11 cwt.Dressed carcase weight .. 9501b. 8901b.   7001b.4. Stabilising limits. With effect from 26th March, 1962 the stabilising limits willbe 10s. Od. (instead of 7s. Od.) on either side of the weekly standard price.5. The differential of 5s. Od. per live cwt. between the rates of guarantee payment for Grade I and Grade II cattle will be applied by increasing the average rate of guaran-tee payment for home-bred cattle by 2s. Id. for Grade I and reducing it by 2s. lid. forGrade II. The resultant rates of payment will be rounded to the nearest 6d. If inrespect of any week the average rate of guarantee payment is 2s. lid. per cwt. or lessthere will be no guarantee payment on Grade II animals and appropriate rates, to be announced separately, will be paid only on Grade I.Fat Sheep6. As in previous years there will be no upper limit to the weight at which live sheepor their carcases may be certified, but any guarantee payment will be restricted to thefollowing weights: Dressed carcase weight^26th March, 1962      On and afterto 1st July, 1962      2nd July, 1962Lambs    ..      ..        551b. 501b.Hoggets and otherclean sheep    ..        65 lb. 60 lb.* In the case of sales by liveweight estimated d.c.w.In the case of sales by deadweight actual d.c.w.7. Stabilising Limits. With effect from 26th March, 1962, the stabilising limitswill be 3d. (instead of 2d.) on either side of the weekly standard price.MilkThe standard quantities for each area in 1962/63 will be increased as follows: Million gallonsNew StandardIncrease QuantityEngland and Wales   ........      22-9 1,721-110 185-801 19-801 9-40-5 97-6Main Scottish Area   .Aberdeen and DistrictNorth of ScotlandNorthern Ireland
Potatoes9. The guarantee for the 1962 crop will be on the basis of a deficiency paymentsscheme similar to that in operation for 1961.10. The Market Support Fund referred to in paragraph 27 of Cmnd. 1311 is intendedto provide means of strengthening the market for potatoes in years of heavy surplus and low prices. If the 1962 crop gives rise to these conditions and the Market SupportFund has not been established, the Government will consult the Potato MarketingBoard about the introduction of arrangements similar to those which applied to the1959 and 1960 crops. Separate arrangements will be made to deal with the special position in Northern Ireland.Sugar Beet     ii11. 1962 Crop. The guarantee arrangements for sugar beet of the 1962 crop willbe on a similar basis to those in operation for the 1961 crop, but for the 1963 crop the changes described in the following paragraph will be introduced.12. 1963 Crop. The guaranteed price to be determined for the 1963 crop will be related to beet of 16-0 per cent, sugar content instead of 16-5 per cent, and the pricedifferential will be increased from 7s. 6d. to 10s. Od., plus or minus, for each one percent, sugar content. The price on which the- British Sugar Corporation^ contract for the purchase of sugar beet for processing at its Scottish factory is based will be thefull guaranteed price (i.e., Is. 9d. per ton more than at present) and certain otherterms of the contract will be varied as follows: (i) beet will be purchased on &quot; delivered-to-factory &quot; terms;(ii) the present deduction in respect of dirt tare exceeding 15 lb. per cwt. will be abolished;(iii) on beet delivered by rail, the Corporation will pay rail freight in excess of6s. 3d. per ton; and(iv) on beet delivered by road, the Corporation will pay rail freight from thegrower&apos;s nearest station in excess of 12s. 6d. per ton.(32133)  Wt  1361-35  K114   3/62  St.S.
