ANNEX TO CoO,S, (62)U&apos;BRITISH STRATEGY IN THE SIXTIESDIGEST REPORTTHE aim to formulate, on the &quot;basis of the given political andfinancial assumptions, a strategy for the United Kingdom in circumstances short of global war to he adopted in the presentdecade and to continue to he applicable &quot;beyond 1970;    and alsoto recommend the size and shape of forces which would he required,&apos;taking into account the financial and manpower implications ofthe forces postulated for NATO *2.     We have &quot;based our study on the political and financialassumptions and the general defence objectives given us &quot;by thePrime Minister, together with guidance from the Minister ofDefence.   We have also taken into account views expressed hyField Marshal Sir Francis Festing.    Finally, we have adopted the following criteria for the scale of military effort to heprovided:-(a) That our land forces would nowhere he involved ona scale greater initially than a reinforced brigade group.(b) An assumption originally stated as a basis for ourcurrent logistic planning    that we would not undertake a major operation (defined as in (a) above) in morethan one overseas theatre at any one time, and notmore often than once in any theatre in a period oftwo years, -(c) That any period of intensive fighting is unlikely tobe prolonged (possibly weeks rather than months),although it could be longer in the Far East if china were not openly involved.(d) That the circumstances in which our forces might haveto intervene could vary from occasions when points of entry, and possibly local facilities, would be availableto us to occasions when the points of entry would be inhostile hands, requiring us to face oppostion toestablish ourselves.    We do not, however, believe thatwe would, at least without Allies, attempt to intervene in the face of heavy opposition requiring us to mounta full-scale assault.3.     Against this background we see the strategy that we should adopt for this decade broadly as follows:-(a)   West of Suez although we shall continue to maintainfootholds in the Mediterranean and Caribbean we shallnot provide forces locally to meet the possibleoperational commitments, but plan to reinforce thesetheatres from the United Kingdom if and as necessary.BROAD CONCEPT OF STRATEGY- 2 -
(&quot;b)    East of Suez we shall depend primarily ontheatre forces based on facilities in thePersian Gulf and Singapore - which are capable of mutual reinforcement and are&quot;backed by an amphibious task force - tomeet our commitments in the Middle and far East theatres respectively;    butheres  too, we shall be able to reinforcefrom the United Kingdom if necessary.(c)    In the United Kingdom a strategic landforce reserve of one (parachute) brigade group with its associated air transport,backed if necessary by two further brigadegroups from one of the divisions earmarked for BAOR.Reinforcement in all cases could be both seaborne and airborne,although we do not plan to have an amphibious capability normallyavailable West of Suez.1+.      In practical terms our forces in the United Kingdom and east of Suez will give us:-(a) A capacity to provide up to one brigade group initially, East or West of Suez, atany one time, plus a &quot;battalion groupelsewhere.or alternatively,(b) A capability concurrently to deploy rapidlyboth East and West of Suez a force of up toan infantry or parachute battalion group.Additionally, East of Suez a Royal Marinecommando or an infantry &quot;battalion groupcould &quot;be delivered &quot;by sea.These forces would be supported by appropriate levels of navaland air forces either maintained in the theatre or deployed as required from the Uni ted. Kingdom.5.     It is necessary, in military prudence, to provide replacementfor forces resident overseas once they are deployed against a planned commitment.    We count on the strategic reserve to meet this requirement, as well as certain direct commitments, and toprovide against the unforeseeable.6.     We see this arrangement as representing the next step towards a more flexible strategic posture based on seaborne andairborne forces, and one which will permit us to continue toprovide military support for our national policies in spite ofdiminution of our overseas footholds.    This we &quot;believe to be a worthwhile transitional strategy for the Sixties.7-      The forces proposed have been derived directly from foresee-able commitments,  and there is little or no margin of strength.Unforeseen tasks&apos; can only be met at the expense of our readiness to meet specific obligations, especially as we are limitedlogistically to one major operation at one time and cannot alwaysknow in advance what the effects of the Barrier would be.
8.      An unforeseen increase in either the size or the quality of the threat against which we have provided and equipped forces would at once add significantly to our military problems.THE CONCEPT IN BACH THEATRE AND RESULTANTFORCE REQUIREMENTSWest of Suez (excluding NATO and CENTO)9.     Provided footholds in the Mediterranean are maintained,forces can he introduced directly and quickly from the U.K.,unimpeded by any barrier.    Our forces permanently deployed inthis theatre can therefore be reduced without suffering an unacceptable diminution in our ability to meet our commitments,provided we have a capacity to reinforce quickly when required.Apart from the contribution needed to NATO and CENTO plans thelargest remaining commitment (Libya)  calls for the initialprovision of up to a brigade group with appropriate naval andair support.    However, as an internal security situation could arise simultaneously with this greater commitment, a furthermajor unit must &quot;be at call to reinforce the resident garrisons.10.   We see the forces needed being found from the strategic reserve in the United Kingdom, from the Fleet and from the airforces based West of Suez.    The time factor for the brigade group operation is to deliver this force, with all its equipment,complete at the scene of operations within seven days.    We would expect to receive a minimum of four days notice for such an operation.    We can expect less warning for internal securityreinforcement, and a capability to fly in one major unit withinabout 36 hours of receiving executive authority is thereforerequired.11.    So long as we have to be able to undertake land operations in the Mediterranean, particularly operations in Libya.for whichtanks are required, it will be necessary to stockpile somevehicles, stores and tanks in the theatre if they are to arrive in the Operational Area by the time required.    After detailedexamintion we have come to the conclusion that economy inmovement resources (both air and sea) can best be achieved, and additional expense minimised, if the stockpile, excluding tankswhich should be stockpiled in Libya, remains in Cyprus.. - Even so the size of the present stockpile there can be appreciably.andprogressively reduced.12.    Our staging posts in Libya are necessary both for thedischarge of our present treaty obligations to that country andas part of our world-wide reinforcement routes.    Libya alsoprovid.es an admirable training area for strategic reserve forces.We plan at present to maintain there a garrison to support the &apos;political requirements of the treaty.   When the treaty is reviewed in 1963 we should, take the opportunity to negotiate the continueduse of our facilities at El Adem and our overflying and trainingrights without retaining the garrison, on the basis of our ability to intervene rapidly as a compensation for its removal.13.    Apart from small forces in the Caribbean and minor detachmentsto meet such other commitments as fishery protection, the simonstown Agreement and the West-About-air route to christmas island, other tasks West of Suez could be undertaken by the FleetWest of Suez, the Strategic Reserve and its associated air transport.- k -
1L1.    The total forces we would provide West of Suez, outsidethe United Kingdom and Germany, are thereforeLand   -   Small garrisons in Libya, Cyprus, Malta,Gibraltar and the West Indies. &apos; -Air     -   Apart from NATO and CENTO forces based in cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar, stagingfacilities in these places and in Libya.Naval -   Fleet forces normally including one fleetcarrier,  together with supporting forces and detachments in the West Indies andSouth Atlantic.    One to two escortsquadrons and some submarines andminesweepers will normally be availablein the Mediterranean.CENTO Forces15&quot;    Our commitments to CENTO involve forces on both sides ofthe barrieri    air forces based in Cyprus, frigates and mine-sweepers In the Middle East and a cruiser from the Far East.MiddleEast1 6.    Land Forces.    We count on the balanced force primarilyprovided to counter the Iraqi ability to attack Kuwait to meet any other major commitment in the theatre.    Separate provision must, however, be made against the possibility of an internal security situation arising elsewhere;    for example, in theHigh Commission territories in Southern Africa, or Mauritius.Against this, and the possibility of an internal securitytask arising in Aden or Bahrein at the same time as intervention in Kuwait, provision must be made for at least one further majorunit.    This could normally be provided by reinforcement from theFar East or,  if necessary, from the United Kingdom.    This unitwould however have no local knowledge of the area and might not beacclimatised.17*    Air Forces.    We believe the requirements on our air forcesat present based on Aden, Bahrein and. in Kenya will tend toincrease rather than decrease,  and we consider that currentlyplanned force levels are justified.    When we leave Kenya the deployment problem at first sight appears likely to entail atleast the provision of another major airfield, but it may bepossible by expanding facilities at Khormaksar and providingsome additional facilities at Bahrein and/or Masirah to limitbuilding to a heliport/SR airfield near Aden.    We have allowed for the latter in our costing, but a final figure can onlybe determined after consulting the local authorities.18.    Naval,Forces.    The planned numbers of frigates and mine-sweepers  (also declared to CENTO) will be required for thePersian Gulf.    Additional naval support,  including naval air support, must be available when required from the Fleet East of suez, and the Commando Ship will also remain associated with theGulf as at present (see paragraph 2.1 below).Far East19*    Land Forces.    The British contribution to the CommonwealthBrigade Group, provided primarily for SEATO,  is equivalent to two major units;    apart from certain &quot;non-Organic&quot; units- 5 -
envisaged in current planning and the necessary individualreinforcements, there will he no plans to provide additional  .&apos;reinforcing units or formations*    We have recently approved,  ina separate study, a land force garrison for Hong kong    Apartfrom these, and talcing into account the EM Commando availabilityin the theatre, forces are required to cover the followingcommitments:-(a) To assist the Government of Greater Malaysia,during the transitional period, in maintaininginternal security in any of its territoriesincluding, possibly, anti-terrorist operations on the Malay/Thai border.(b) To assist in the defence of Commonwealthterritories in the IJTZAM area.(c) The local protection (including the safety ofBritish families) and the maintenance, to theextent that we may use them, of the SingaporeBase and facilities elsewhere in Malaysia.(d) Internal security reinforcement of Hong kong and the Western Pacific.20.    We therefore propose to provide in Greater Malaysia a forceorganised as a brigade of two battalions, a field battery and afield squadron.   We would also locate there the non-organiccombatant units which we require East of the Barrier and forwhich accommodation is not available in the Arabian Peninsula.Adjustment to the above deployment will entail the withdrawal of four Army major units from Malaysia and one from Hong Kong.21 -    Naval Forces.    We consider these as one entity East of thebarrier.    Apart from the declaration of a cruiser to CENTO, fixedcommitments exist to SEATO and Commonwealth plans,    A redeploymentwill be necessary from West of Suez, with a consequent reductionin Category A N./..T0 forces;    although a small increase in escortsin commission and in afloat support over present plans for theNavy as a whole would,be necessary.    Normally, two aircraft carriers with a nuclear capability (the second deployed at theexpense of the Fleet West of Suez), will be the main surface units.In addition, a fully effective Amphibious Group will be provided.We consider this justified not only for tasks in the Middle East(including the provision of an amphibious capability in&quot;the persian gulf - see paragraph 18 above) and our amphibious commitment toSEATO but also to provide our forces with a beach/VTOL landingcapacity East of Suez and to give us a degree of military presence in areas where we have, or shall have, no garrisons.22.    To meet the commitment for tanks to be permanently poisedat sea for Kuwait, a second Assault Ship must be commissioned.This we see being based on Singapore.    Similarly, to maintainone Commando Ship constantly available, having regard to theage of these ships and the possibility of accident or breakdown,we propose that the second Commando Ship shortly to be commissionedshould normally be based and refitted in the Par East.    Theirhelicopter squadrons are counted towards the permanently availablelift East of Suez.23.    To maintain.the required embarked Commando trained and efficient a second, is needed, rotation occurring every twomonths under normal circumstances.    We have considered whetherthe exchange could not be done by air from the United kingdom but have concluded that to avoid loss of availability and- 6 -
TOP SECRET126problems arising from acclimatisation, training caonsiderations and disturbance, the second unit should be located in SingaporeTo operate and train with the second Commando Ship a thirdCommando will at times be required, which could perhaps be based in the United Kingdom and flown out and back as necessary;    andwe have costed on this assumption.    While so long as shoresupport can be maintained in Singapore no aircraft support shipneed be provided in the theatre.2k&apos;    Air Forces.    The force levels are derived from the foreseenspecific operations tasks rather than by direct reference to the potential air threats, although these are&apos; considerable and growing.They are to contribute to the Allied nuclear deterrent to China,to support SEATO operations and to defend United Kingdom and commonwealth interests.    The capacity of transport support forces is at present below the agreed levels, and is due to be expandedfor MRT and VTOL aircraft.    Similarly missile air defence not yetdeployed, is due to be built up to three SAM squadrons.    It isin our view essential that the planned expansion of MRT aircraft,and VTOL aircraft to one-company lift, should be completed,particularly as the MRT transport resources in this theatre andin the Middle East will even then only provide the capacity forone parachute battalion assault in the whole area East of Suez,So far as the air defence forces are concerned we accept the risks entailed in their reduction, by one missile squadron, tothe minimum acceptable of one AWF and one missile squadron ineach of the two air defence areas.25*    Total force requirements East of Suez therefore ares-Land   - Two brigade groups (one in Aden and a reduced one in South East Asia), plusour contribution to the CommonwealthBrigade (2 units) and appropriate non-organic combatant supporting unitsstationed in Malaysia for operations in the general area East of Suez.    Inaddition a garrison of 6-g major unitsis planned for Hong Kong, apart fromessential Gurkha engineer support.Air     - Air defence, direct support, strike and reconnaissance forces,, and transportlift for one parachute battalion group,based in Aden, the Persian Gulf and SSouth East Asia.Naval - Fleet forces based mainly on Singapore,.normally including two fleet carriers,,together with a Commando Ship and anAssault Ship fully operational,appropriate escorts and afloat support,and submarines and minesweepers.    Thesecond Gomrnando Ship and Assault Ship,,provided primarily for backing, willalso be available much of the time.Facilities Required in Greater Malaysia26,    The proposed deployment and force requirements in the far east depend on our maintaining specific facilities in the theatrewhen Greater Malaysia comes about.- 7 -
Strategic Reinforcement from the United Kingdom27.    We propose locating the following forces in the UnitedKingdom for reinforcement:-Land   - One parachute brigade group, plus up to two additional brigade groups whichwould have the dual role of reinforsingBAOR and limited war operations (see para 28 below).Air     - Strategic and medium-range squadrons to liftand support a brigade group at light scalesand to drop one parachute battalion group.Squadrons held for reinforcement in theUnited Kingdom and Germany for all weatherfighter, ground attack, strike and reconnaissance roles.These forces are in addition to the training and other units and establishments of the three Services in the United Kingdom,NATO Forces28o    Land, Forces.    We have,  as directed, worked on the assumptionthat two divisions would be stationed in Germany and two in theUnited Kingdom, both the latter also being available if necessary as potential reinforcement for limited war overseas.    On this assumption, to minimize expenditure on equipment we allowed for only one of the United Kingdom-based division (C Division) being-held as an immediate reinforcement for BAOR as it would need astockpile of BAOR-type heavy equipment in Germany and a duplicateset of this equipment with it for essential training in theUnited kingdom.om.    We saw   the second division in the United Kingdom(D Division), although also assigned to NATO,  as being organised and equipped for slower movement to BAOR and as a reserve for overseas reinforcement.29.    However, even modified in this way,  the cost of implementing the proposal is likely to result in such heavy expenditure thatwe now suggest that it should be reconsidered.3Q*    Naval Forces. This deployment plan would result, in a shortfall  in the 1966 NATO Category A requirements of 1-aircraft carrier, 2 anti-submarine carriers, 1  cruiser, 32 destroyers orfrigates, 1  submarine,  other additional minor craft and at timesan additional aircraft carrier,31.   j^r Forcer^ Two all weather fighters, one day fighter,five fighter/tactical reconnaissance and four light bomber squadrons are at present based in Germany.    The two all weatherfighter and day fighter squadrons arc due to be withdrawn anddisbanded in 1962j    thereafter any fighter, as well as transport,requirements arising in Germany will be met from the UnitedKingdom.    A further commitment is the assignment in nuclearsupport of NATO of three V-bomber squadrons (Valiants) based in the United Kingdom.    In addition we plan to provide a two-company VTOL lift for the United Kingdom and BAOR, of which atleast a part will be based in Germany.    The total shortfall of airforces against NATO 1966 force goals will then be:-36 AWF aircraftk SAM units16 reconnaissance aircraft33 LRMR aircraft.- 8 -
32.    We have assumed that we shall continue throughout, theSixties to maintain our contribution to the strategic nuclear deterrent of the West at the level of expenditure now planned,pending review in 1962 when the future of SKYBOLT should bemore precisely known.IMPLICATIONS OH THE SERVICES33*    The British Army. Although current plans for the developmentof both the Royal Navy and the RAF will be considerably affectedby the adoption of this strategy it is on the Army that thegreatest effect will be felt.    The reduction inherent in the strategic deployment we propose,  of the order of some 12 majorunits, would inevitably involve a considerable measure of re-organisation. Further considerable reductions would follow inheadquarters staffs and administrative units from the newdeployment and from changes in the role of our overseas forces;these will give rise to redundancy with its associated very substantial compensatory payments for which our costings havenot allowed and to real problems in the field of career structure,,3Uo    Gurkhas.    The reduction in the size of the Army,  coupled with the political consideration which have inhibited us In theemployment of Gurkha troops, brings the future of Gurkha units in a smaller British Army into question.35*    Royal Malta Artillery.   Under existing plans one regiment ofthe Royal Malta Artillery is located In Malta.    The other regimentRMA, at present in Malta, is planned to go to BAOR as a transportunit in the short term and thereafter to be disbanded. Under our new strategy we envisage there being only one unit in Malta, for internal security purposes.    This, we consider, should be a UnitedKingdom battalion, and the remaining RMA.    Surplus to the require-ments to provide a transport unit in BAOR in the short term and the backing in Malta should be disposed of.36.    The Royal Marines.    In our proposed deployment we have included the five Royal Marine Commandos and have retained theirbacking in the United Kingdom.    If, as a result of currentstudies, a high degree of inter-changeability comes about betweeninfantry battalions and RM Commandos, it should be possible to achieve some reduction overall.THE,SIXTIES AS A PERIOD OF TR,^NSITION.37*    We must finally stress once again that this strategy assumesthe availability of facilities in the Arabian Peninsula and singapore until 1970.    For financial reasons we have not beenable to recommend the provision during the Sixties of alternativefacilities, including additional seaborne forces, strategictransport aircraft and bases in Australia.    If for any reasonpolitical developments in either of these places compel us towithdraw before the middle-Seventies the lack of these alternativefacilities will greatly complicate, and make for considerable delay in, the meetings of our likely residual commitments&apos;until they are provided.    In particular,&apos; in view of the time it takes tobuild ships and to procure aircraft (particularly VC 10&apos;s) andthe essential part played by Singapore in an interim strategy, theeffect of the premature loss of the facilities there would be particularly crippling.
SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES AND HIGHER DIRECTIONAFTER THE&quot;TlXTIES &apos; .38.    Having considered general trends,  including the developing use of space for military purposes, we &quot;believethat in the future we should come to look on sea,  land andair forces, not in terms of units provided by a particular service, hut in terms of applying complementary power from the three elements.    The conditions we foresee willmore than ever emphasise the joint nature of operations for meeting our commitments short of global war.    It is possiblethat an extension of this trend, so that eventually each ofthe three Services   operated all the units designed to fight inor on its own element may be necessary to achieve maximumflexibility and efficiency with economy in the conditions ofthe future.    We are arranging for this question to be studied.39.   We see nc reason why the same principle should notapply to Command, which cannot but be improved by the removalof ambiguities and the elimination of overlappingresponsibilities.    We see, however, no change required in theprinciple of naval command at sea or army or air command of shore-based operations, according to the Service whoserole predominates.    Under the control of a Unified C-in--Cand observing the normal practice of Task Commanders for operations where there is no shift of emphasis so substantialas to require a change-over of command from one Service toanother, we foresee no command obstacle to changes whichmight be found desirable for the reasons given above.AO.   There will inevitably be reflected changes in higherdirection and Service administration in the United kingdom from the strategy we have proposed.    The Services willhave to grow together at home if so large a part of theireffort overseas is to be as well co-ordinated and led asWe foresee it can and must be, and if operational andequipment requirements are to be properly formulated.- 10 -
