Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1962C. (62) 27 Copy No.     5013th February, 1962CABINETECONOMIC POLICY AND&apos; PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet will wish to be aware of the course of the discussion in theEconomic Policy Committee on 7th February about the economic case formoderating the proposed increases in public investment. The relevant extractfrom the minutes is attached at Annex A. This present paper is circulated tothe Cabinet in fulfilment of the undertaking I gave to the Committee.2. On present plans, public service investment will increase by 6 per cent,in 1962*-63 and by nearly 10 per cent, in 1963-64. I am clear that this is too much, but it will be seen from Annex A that there was a division of opinion inthe Economic Policy Committee. Hereunder I take the main points raised and examine them. Some of them relate not only to the proposed increase in public investment, but to the prospective increase in public expenditure generally.(a) Will the economy be overloaded or not in 1963-64 and thereafter?3. To judge of this, it is largely irrelevant to discuss the degree of slack inthe economy at the present moment (beginning of 1962). What is relevant is the picture of the total load on the economy in 1963-64 and the following few years.The Report on Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62 to 1965-66,commissioned by the Cabinet on 28th March, 1961 (C.C. (61) 19th Conclusions,Minute 4), and circulated with C. (61) 88 last summer pointed unmistakably to increasing difficulty in meeting all the calls that will be made upon our resources.4. That is why the whole question of having a long-term public expenditureplan has arisen. If the prospective resources were big enough to provide for all our defence, oversea aid, social policy, agricultural policy, etc., with enough alsoto look after the expectations of the public for a higher standard of living, enlargedindustrial and other private investment to sustain economic growth, and (mose essential of all) the exports needed to put our balance of payments right, there wouldbe no difficulty. But the best assessment which it was possible to make of thematter, fully discussed between senior officials of all Departments last year, pointedclearly to the fact that this was not so. Later work now nearing completionsuggests, unhappily, that the above mentioned Report (C. (61) 88) was in fact too optimistic, and that the threatened overload is going to be still greater than was thenthought.5. We are starting from a position of deficit, since the current volume of our exports is insufficient to enable us to cover all the disbursements abroad that wehave to make, including provision for aid and for capital investment. It is truethat at this moment we have some slack, though it is open to question whether thisslack is more than is necessary to provide for movement of resources between oneuse and another. In some directions there is ample plant capacity to spare; but the true bottleneck at present is skilled labour. We could not man all our capacitywith the labour available.6. The shortage of skilled labour is particularly acute in the building and engineering industries.  If exports were at the level that we require, this shortage60406a
would be correspondingly more acute (see paragraphs 16-17 below). If for examplewe are right in thinking that we ougbrt to aim at expansion in exports of the orderof 10 per cent, by volume between now and the spring of 1963, this will be equivalentto an additional output of the order of  360-400 million, or (say) 1^ per cent, of our total national production.7. Again, we Have to reckon on an increase of  100 million a year in total public investment (even if the proposals of the Chief Secretary, Treasury, for/reduction are accepted in full), and possibly about  150 million a year in other public purchases of goods and services (defence, education, health, etc.). For this we are pre-empting another 1 per cent, a year of the total national production.8. If exports (and public sector expenditure) increased by drawing intoemployment workers who are at present idle and unemployment in total is now only 2 per cent.-or if such short-time working as there is were brought to an end and succeeded by overtime, the additional earnings that would result both for labourand for capital would be bound to lead to some more demand for consumptiongoods and services. And the growth of production leads to growth in the demandfor private investment.9. In other words, if we are to get on top of our balance of payments problems,and retain our public service programmes, we need all the slack we at present haveand more.10. It is much too early to say with precision what will be the short-term economic position in 1963-64. But there is evidence amounting to a clearprospect of accumulating pressure on resources, lor exports (if we succeed in makingourselves solvent) and for the growth of the public sector. There would be plenty of time to add to the public investment programmes later if by any chance this proved to be desirable they are looked at again in July, to see if short-termadjustments are needed. But most Departments want long-term decisions e.g.,decisions on &quot; starts &quot; in 1963-64 which will commit investment expenditure into1964-65 and 1965-66.1.1. Repeatedly in the last 18 months the Government have said that public investment programmes cannot be properly handled by &quot; stop-and-go &quot; policiesdepending upon the short-term economic position. These statements have been widely welcomed. The public investment and public expenditure programmesgenerally must be based on a long-term view. The long-term evidence of continuingoverload on our resources is conclusive.(b) Would not a successful incomes policy alter the basis of the balance of claims and resources, reduce demand and provide room for more public investment?12. It cannot be argued that income restraint will do the trick and that thereis no need for further reductions in expenditure. There is an important differencebetween wage and income restraint on the one hand and a reduction in expenditureon goods and services on the other. The object of wage restraint is to prevent thevalue of the currency, at home and abroad, from being eroded. Other things being equal, if wages increase, fairly quickly prices increase correspondingly and thus thevalue of the currency falls. Though some sections may end up better off and others(those on fixed incomes) worse off, the total purchasing power of the people isunaffected. This may not be true in the very short run, when profit margins do not immediately respond to competitive impulses; but it quickly becomes true.13. If we are unsuccessful in preventing the economy from being overloaded -in the sense that demand on resources is excessive we are bound to end up with a demand inflation and the usual balance of payments crisis. This is likely,indeed, to make wages rise faster than before, because if there is heavy Governmentspending it will aggravate the situation by accentuating the shortage of labour.It is important to bear in mind the distinction between demand inflation and costinflation. If the Government is unsuccessful in obtaining wage restraint,admittedly we fail to stop cost inflation, but we can none the less stop demandinflation if only we keep a grip of the Budget.14. Indeed, the truth of the matter is that an incomes policy cannot be successfully sustained unless demand is kept well within resources and overloadis prevented. Preventing overload is one essential condition for the success of anincomes policy.
(c) Would not higher taxation be better than restraining the growth of public expenditure?15. We can reduce the growth of total demand either by checking the growth of public expenditure or by raising taxes. There is not however an exact symmetrybetween the two. A reduction in expenditure is almost certain to mean a lowerdemand for resources. An increase in taxation, on the other hand, may or maynot restrain demand, since efforts will be made to pass it on to someone else andin the long run the public may reduce savings to pay the taxes. Furthermore,we cannot ignore the effect of increased taxation on incentives, or on the exportdrive; and of course the political implications are obvious.(d) Is this overall treatment realistic?   Ought we not really to be looking atindividual industries and individual places?16. The analysis of national income and expenditure tends to equate one type of demand collectively with another, with little regard to the specific resourcesthat are in demand. But the opposite point of view, insisting on the individualityof resources, has far-reaching implications. If we think in terms of adjustingdemand to supply; industry by industry, we are forced step by step to introduce a series of controls with this purpose in mind. In fact the assumption that different types of demand on resources substantially equate with one another is a goodworking rule. There is a high degree of inter-industry mobility and a comparatively small margin of unused resources (particularly manpower resources) available tobe redistributed if the shortage is more critical in one industry than in another.17. For example, a recent report of a Working Party appointed by theMinistry of Labour showed that about one-third of the engineering and of thebuilding workers in the country are employed outside the engineering and buildingindustries respectively. It also showed that there Was still in September 1961 an acute shortage of skilled workers in a wide range of engineering and allied trades and among building craftsmen in practically every region of the country. Anychange in the demand for building and engineering labour therefore makes itselffelt not only in those two groups of industries but in a whole range of otherindustries. It is not true that employment in the building industry remains moreor less constant from one year to another, or that there is no competition for labourbetween it and export industries.18. Geographical mobility is more limited than industrial mobility, althoughover a period there is considerable mobility, specially for example of Irish labour.While there is something to be said for the view that cutting down building workin areas where the building industry is not under pressure is of less advantage tothe economy than cutting it down in London or Birmingham, it is not clear that thebuilding industry is going to have any substantial margin of spare capacity in anypart of the country.(e) Would not the chance of success of an incomes policy be prejudiced by measures limiting the growth of social services (or by cuts such as welfare milk)?19. Ten years ago this question in another form was being used as an argument against the wisdom of our abolishing the food subsidies. As a matter of historicalfact, there is little evidence that, in the past, workers&apos; attitudes to wage claims havebeen affected by Government policy on social services. The Trades Union Congresshas in this case expressly rejected the incomes policy, and is hardly likely to have its attitude changed by marginal alterations in public investment policy or indeedby decisions on welfare milk or school meals.20. Again it must be emphasised that a sure way to wreck the incomes policyis to permit overload of resources. This is, incidentally, clearly shown in Dutchexperience.(f) The strength of Sterling21. Moreover, there is another consideration. If people here and abroadsee Government expenditure appearing not to be under firm control they will draw their own conclusions about the prospect of inflation; and if they draw a conclusion60406
unfavourable to us, all our hopes of steady growth will go too. It is wise to remindourselves that, taking into account our oversea commitments, the pound is beingsustained at present by an inflow of capital, and that this could very rapidly changeif foreign holders of sterling were not persuaded that we were taking a strong gripof the economy.22. The issue of principle which the Economic Policy Committee has remitted to the Cabinet to decide is whether, following a 6 per cent, increase in public service investment in 1962-63, the Government can undertake a 10 per cent, increase in1963-64 without overloading the economy in that year and thereafter. In the lightof the foregoing, I am sure we cannot.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,12th February, 1962.
ANNEX A-EXTRACT- FROM THE MINUTES OF THE ECONOMIC s POLICY&apos;        ;CO^rTTEE- ON 7th FEBRUARY, 1962 : \The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it would be necessary to make apublic statement on the steps which the Government were taking to control public expenditure before the publication of the Vote on Account on 27th February.It was therefore urgent to take final decisions not only on the level of the estimates for 1962-63, but on the investment programmes for the public sector for the year1963-64. All the Treasury forecasts showed that there was likely to be a continuedoverload on the economy for some years ahead, and it was essential to ensurethat the public sector did not absorb resources which could be used by private industry to promote the level of exports. Paragraph 3 of E.A. (62) 16 showed thatthe level of investment in the public services (as distinct from the nationalised industries) rose in 1961-62 by 12^ per cent, over 1960-61 and was planned toincrease by a further 6 per cent, in 1962-63 and nearly 10 per cent, in 1963-64.The latter increase was far in excess of any likely increase in the gross national product and if an economic crisis were to be averted it would be necessary toreduce the rate of increase of public service investment in the three years 1963-64to 1965^66 by at least  50 million a year. He thought it fair to ask all -ministers to help him to contain the growth within the limit he had set himself. He had therefore asked for a number of reductions in Departmental programmes for publicservice investment in addition to those discussed at earlier meetings. Even so, thetotal list would produce economies amounting to only  42^ million a year. He had therefore suggested other cuts in the proposed expenditure on the nationalised industries which would go some way to meet the gap between  42^ million andthe target of  50 million.In discussion doubt was expressed whether there was in fact likely to be anoverload on the economy in 1963-64. There was some evidence already thatsome industries, especially the steel industry, were not working to full capacity and could with advantage take more home orders which, by enabling them to spreadtheir overhead costs, could make them more competitive in the export markets.Moreover, figures relating to architects&apos; commissions showed that there had beena considerable fall in new orders between the first and third quarters of 1961(the latest available figures), particularly in the private sector. It seemed thereforewrong to assume that the construction industries would not have enough capacity to take on the investment programme proposed for 1963-64 and subsequent years.It was argued, on the other hand, that there was plenty of evidence that the economy was overloaded. Despite the rigorous measures taken in July 1961,unemployment at the seasonal peak in January 1962 had reached a level of only 2 percent. If any of the restrictive measures were removed the margin of slack in the economy would soon disappear. The spare capacity in such industries as the steelindustry was required for the increase in exports which was essential to avoid afurther balance of payments crisis and to increase the rate of economic growth. Asregards the load on the building industry itself, there were still many moreoutstanding vacancies for carpenters and bricklayers than the supply, and if thepresent rate of apprenticeship training continued, the situation would get worserather than better.The success of the Governmenfs incomes policy depended on the self-discipline and co-operation of the public. This would not be forthcoming if the government did not show that they believed in and were planning for economic growth. Thefigures in paragraph 3 of E.A. (62) 16 showed an increase of 22 per cent, in the levelof public service investment in 1965-66 over 1961-62, which was not too high separately of investment if the objective were to seaire economic growth of 4 per cent, ayear. Against this it was argued that it was important that the growth should takeplace in the right parts of the economy and that moderate restraint on home demand would help to promote exports. Moreover, the figures given in E.A. (62) 16 for theyears after 1963-64 were likely to be understated. The public statement that would
be made would not give the impression that the Government were cutting backtheir investment programmes: the schools programme was the only one which hadbeen published and the Government would have to say that in present circumstances the increase in this programme would have to be phased.It was argued that if the Governments incomes policy proved successful, theslower increase in incomes would lessen the load on the economy and provide roomby 1963-64 for the  50 million of public service investment which the chief secretary, Treasury, was now proposing to cut. On the other hand, a reduction inthe growth of incomes did not reduce demand to the same extent: its effect was mainly to keep prices steady and to avoid a cost inflation. The country would notescape inflation caused by excess demand if the Government allowed programmes which would clearly overload the economy.It was suggested that if it was necessary to reduce demand over the economy as a whole, higher taxation might be a better method of achieving the Governmentsobjectives than a reduction of public authority investment programmes. against this it was argued that higher taxation would increase the costs of industry and make it more difficult to secure an expansion of exports. Moreover, higher taxationwas not as effective a method of reducing the load on the economy as controllinginvestment programmes, since the money required for increased taxes might merelybe withdrawn from savings without any reduction in economic activity.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, summing up, said that there was a division ofview in the Committee on the economic arguments which were the basis of theproposals put forward in E.A. (62) 16 for a reduced rate of growth in public investment. He would therefore arrange, in consultation with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, for a memorandum to be submitted to the Cabinet.
