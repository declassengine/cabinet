kHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (62) 213rd February, 1962COPY NO.     SiCABINETSHORT-TERM ECONOMIES IN THE COST OFAGRICULTURAL SUPPORT AND THE ANNUAL&quot;FARM PRICE&quot; review memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury the Farm Price Review Committee have considered reports by officials, prepared in accordance with the conclusion of the Cabinet on12th December, 1961 (C. C. (6l) 71st Conclusions, Minute 6,Conclusion (3)), on the possibility of securing further economies in thecost of agricultural support in the short term.2.      Officials concluded that the only measures worth immediate consideration were:-(i)the application of the principle of &quot;standard quantities&quot;, i, e. , limiting the quantity ofproduce on which guaranteed prices would bepaid in respect of certain commodities forwhich there are no such limits at present;and(ii)  abolishing the Exchequer subsidy on milk, whichat present amounts to about  8 million perannum.The Committee agreed with this conclusion.     They felt however that,while the application of &quot;standard quantities&quot; to further commoditiesmight well be a useful instrument in future, there were powerfularguments against making this major policy change at the presentmoment.     I concurred.3.      The general Exchequer subsidy on milk (which is quite distinct from the subsidy on welfare milk) arises because the &quot;standard quantity&quot;, on which the price is guaranteed to producers, exceeds bysome 100 million gallons the total amount of the liquid consumption(plus a 20 per cent reserve), the cost of which is recovered fromconsumers of liquid milk.    The Exchequer bears the loss on thisdifference of 100 million gallons, which has been sold for manufacturing.
4.      Officials concluded that it would be possible to abolish thesubsidy either at the expense of the producer, by reducing by 100 million gallons the amount of the &quot;standard quantity&quot; on which the guaranteed price is paid, or by raising the price of liquid milk to consumers byjrd. a pint for four months in the year above what it would otherwise havebeen.     The first course would be bitterly opposed by the national farmers&apos; Unions and the Milk Marketing Boards, and the loss to farmincomes would have to count against the maximum permissiblereductions in farm support in the Annual Price Review, at indeedmere than the amount of the saving to the Exchequer.    Officialsrecommended that, if the subsidy were to be removed, the second course should be adopted.5.      The Committee also considered a report by officials in prepara-tion for the Annual Price Review which will begin on 7th February.The Committee agreed that consultations with the National Farmers&apos;Unions should be started on the basis that this year there must be a&quot;minimum determination&quot;.     This would involve reducing the value ofthe guarantees to the farmers by about  14^ million.    In discussingwhere these reductions would fall there was, however, some dis-agreement in the Committee on one point.6.      The Agricultural Ministers attached great importance to takingback the increase of 0. 8d. per gallon of milk which the government agreed to last year on the express understanding that the Unions woulddevise a satisfactory alternative to the present support arrangements;this they have now been unable to do.     They also pointed out that milk production had increased by 100 million gallons in 1961 and was fore-cast to go up by a further 75 million in 1962.     On production groundsthere was a strong case for taking off the 0. 8d.7.      I pointed out, however, that the reduction of 0. 8d. per gallonwould use up  61- million of the  14jr million in a way which would not produce any saving for the Exchequer, because under present arrange-ments the benefit would accrue not to the Exchequer, but to theconsumer in a lower retail price.    It was essential in presentcircumstances that the savings to the Exchequer should amount to atleast the full  14jr million.     Therefore, while appreciating theMinister&apos;s desire to take back last year&apos;s increase in the guaranteed price of milk to the producer, I felt able to accept it only on the under-standing that at the same time  8 million should be saved by abolishing the Exchequer subsidy.     These changes taken together (i. e. , reducingthe guaranteed price and eliminating the subsidy) would leave the retail price to the consumer during the coming year no higher than itwould have been if no changes at all were made this year.8.      The Minister of Agriculture, however, said that at present theconsumer was called upon to pay for the cost of the milk which heconsumed, plus a reserve of 20 per cent, and he c ould see no case for putting on to the consumer the additional cost of the present subsidy,which represents a loss on milk sold for manufacture.    I pointed outthat, if he took this view, the logical course would be to remove thesubsidy by reducing &quot;standard quantities&quot; at the cost of producers (seeparagraph 4 above), even though this would be expensive and otherwiseundesirable.-2-SECRET
9. As Chairman of the Farm Price Review Committee, I ask my colleagues to decide:-(i)     whether the reductions in guaranteed prices atthe Annual Farm Price Review should includethe taking back of the 0. 8d. increase per gallonof milk agreed on a year ago (in which case the saving to the Exchequer from the Review couldnot exceed  8 million a year), or whether theyshould be made on commodities other thanmilk (in which case the saving to the exchequer would be  14-j million a year);(ii)     if the former, whether the Exchequer subsidy on milk should be abolished, at a furthersaving to the Exchequer of   8 million ayear, making  16 million a year in all.H.
