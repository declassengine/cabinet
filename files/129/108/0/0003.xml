Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1962C. (62) 3 Copy No.    g g4th January, 1962CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1962-63 TO 1965-66Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general we are faced with two critical problems in public expenditure:(i) The immediate problem of 1962-63, to honour the &quot; not more than 2\ percent, increase &quot; undertaking which the Chancellor of the Exchequergave on 25th July.(ii) The longer-term problem of bringing the growth of expenditure under control, and into reasonable relation with our prospective resources.2. We need to solve both within the next few weeks. The total of the 1962-63Estimates has to be published with the Vote on Account in the middle of February,and we shall be expected to show at that time how it squares with our undertaking.In his 1961 Budget speech the Chancellor spoke of a five-year public expenditureplan, and he will be expected to expound it in his 1962 Budget. If we overrun thepledged limit for 1962-63 to any significant extent, the only possible defence toParliament and public opinion (including our creditors) is that the momentum was too strong to be brought under effective control in six months but that we havetaken unmistakable steps to do so steps of which we can give evidence at the timeof the Vote on Account3. This paper is to set out, as best I can, what is involved in this. Annex Adescribes the background, starting with the Cabinet decision last March for thepreparation of a long-term expenditure plan: summarising the report by officials(&quot; Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62 to 1965-66 &quot;) which was submittedto the Cabinet in June under C. (61) 88: and describing the action since.4. First, I must say that the basic assumptions of the Report were generally regarded as optimistic (Annex A, paragraphs 10-12). It assumed a solution of thebalance of payments problem (none is yet in sight), a substantial increase comparedwith the last decade in the rate of growth of national productivity, and willingnessby the public to reduce its rate of increase of consumption. Little has happenedsince to make these look more realistic. We face a severe economic strugglethroughout the next five years; a struggle in which our oversea creditors will bewatching our performance closely.5. Secondly, even on these favourable assumptions the Report was not ableto make recommendations that would contain public expenditure within theCabinet&apos;s desired 42 - 5 per cent, of gross national product (G.N.P.). It was reckonedthat a growth of  1,000 million in public expenditure in the five years would be compatible with the desideratum (or  800 million if no more than a 2 per cent,rate of increase of productivity could be assumed). The proposals provided  1,100million increase (Annex A, paragraph 18).CONFIDENTIAL60207 this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
6.   Thirdly, we are still far short of carrying out even these proposals:Nationalised industries   ...Assistance to industry ...AgricultureDefence     ......Education.........Health Service     ......Public  service  investment the British Transport Commission and theNational Coal Board are developing worse than assumed.Criteria are being worked outon Cunarder.saving securedNutritional servicesAdministrative and minorsavingsOther servicesProposal was to contain cost of support and services within the 1961-62 Estimate of 277 million. But 1962-63 Estimate is over 40 million above that, and the commitmentis still open-ended.The Minister of Defence is, I know, consider -ing a plan to accord with the proposed limit.Proposal was to keep growth of current expenditure down to 3 per cent, per annum.The Minister wishes it to continue to growat over A\ per cent, per annum.Proposal has been substantially accepted byHealth Ministers: rate of increase to bekept to 2\ per cent, per annum.If my proposal in C. (61) 218 is accepted, topare down the rate of growth to 10-15 percent., public investment will still be about 65 million higher in 1965-66 than was allowed in the June proposals.We must get at least  35 million here: a continuing saving. 15 million secured: much of it a continuingsaving.Other things (e.g., oversea aid) tend to be running higher than was provided in the june proposals.7. The upshot is that even when we have got a long-term defence budget and a public service investment programme within the proposed limits, and havemade the saving on nutritional services, we are still likely to be about  200 million higher than the June proposals for 1965-66, which were themselves  100 million higher than what would have maintained the 42-5 per cent, ratio, and  300 million higher than would have maintained the 42-5 per cent, ratio at the last decade&apos;rate of increase of productivity. What I am trying to do is to stop the rate of growth of public expenditure from getting altogether out of hand, not to pin itto an arbitrary ratio.8. In order to show to the world that we have an effective long-term policy for containing the growth of public expenditure and keeping it in a tolerablerelationship with the prospective growth of resources, we need to put ourselves ina position to announce:(i) For education, health services and public service investment (includingroads, housing, etc.), and defence (if security conditions permit), therates of growth of expenditure on each of which we are basing our plans for the next five years.(ii) For agriculture and assistance to nationalised and private industry and oversea aid, the policies which we are carrying out for setting limits tothe expenditure.(iii) For the rest, that we are working on similar lines (pensions is rather aspecial case).(iv) The aggregate effect of all this in relation to the prospective growth ofnational resources,9. This is in my view the minimum which could be regarded as carryingweight.   When the work of the National Economic Development Council gets
going, it will probably be necessary to publish much more comprehensivestatements. In all this, the short-term and the long-term actions reinforce eachother: the measures taken to carry out the &quot; 2\ per cent, undertaking &quot; will contribute to the long-term objective, and carrying out the long-term containmentof public expenditure will help the annual Estimates.10. If we do not change our policies in such a way as to restrain the growth olexpenditure, we shall be faced with the same experience year by year: the Estimatescoming in with increases of 7 to 8 per cent, or more, as they have done in each ofthe last four years, and the ratio of Supply expenditure to G.N.P. (and also of public expenditure as a whole) continually rising.11. This is brought out clearly in Annex B,. which for the decade since 1951illustrates the growth of Supply expenditure and also the interesting change ofcomposition in the early years: it was the measures taken to contain defence expenditure after Korea that permitted a great expansion of social expenditureconsistently with falling taxation. Now there are no levelled-out programmes. Thismeans that we have to settle priority between the rates of expansion, and decide which are to go forward faster than others, and by how much. Faster expansionfor one must mean slower expansion for all others.12. Annex C brings out the same point for public service investment, which(other than public housing) doubled between 1955-56 and 1962-63: in this case it was the decline in public housing that made room first for growth in the nextlargest item (education) and then for the gradual build-up of the roads and hospital and local authority programmes, which had till then been held back to give roomfirst for the houses and then for the schools. But here again there are now nodeclining programmes.13. I am afraid that these facts are inescapable and that, if we pretend they donot exist, events will take charge, with a repetition of the crises and frustrations. Ido not myself believe that a continuing increase of taxation offers an acceptableway out: the public will not reduce their consumption but will reduce their saving,and industry will suffer because of the disincentive to risk-taking that a rising taxburden involves. Though I myself cannot see a solution to our problems in increasing taxation, yet if we do believe that that is preferable to hard economieswe should face that frankly, and determine how far we can increase it, and thencontrol our expenditure to keep us within that limit.14. But this is not only a question of taxes. As the public services grow, they take more and more of the real resources of the community. It is of note that thepublic sector employs half the people with good honours degrees now; and asthe university and education and health services grow and also the Government-financed scientific establishments, an increasing proportion of the nation&apos;s bestbrain-power is drawn there instead of into industry and trade. For a nation whichmust export to live, there comes obviously a danger-point.15. Not for one moment would I disparage the national and social advantages which flow from much of our public expenditure. I am convinced that it mustexpand. But this is a question of degree and of timing. If we think that the great bulk of the extra expenditure proposed will help us to solve the critical economic problems of the next five years, we are deceiving ourselves. Education expenditure is in itself a huge investment already: so is health expenditure: so are others.New capital expenditure on education now being planned will not result in any significant change in the skill and application of the labour force before the 1970&apos;s;and many of our growing expenditures are much less closely related than education to our economic potential. The truth is that a great many of our forms of public expenditure have long-term economic advantages for Britain but do not let usimagine that to carry them out is a practical contribution to solving our economic problem of the next five years.16. In the expenditure decisions, both short term and long term, which wehave to take in the next few weeks, we must keep our priorities straight. Thecentral problem of the next five years is to set our economy right, and to achieve abetter performance in real growth and solvency. We must take these expendituredecisions in a way that treats this five-year task as the first objective. Otherwisewe shall not get through to the second five years.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,3rd January, 1962.60207
ANNEX ATHE LONG-TERM PUBLIC SECTOR plan the Course of EventsAt the end of March, the Cabinet (C.C. (61) 19th Conclusions) invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to work out a plan for thedevelopment of the public sector and its expenditure over the next four years, onthe assumption that the ratio of public expenditure to the gross national productshould remain at 42-5 per cent., to examine methods of financing such expenditure,and to report on the implications for economic growth, taxation and the balanceof payments (C.C. (61) 19th Conclusions, Minute 4).2.   In his Budget speech, the Chancellor said:&quot; I have recently set in hand a study of the whole problem of public expenditure in relation to the prospective future growth of our resources fora period of five years ahead. . . . The object of carrying out the study whichI have just mentioned is to see how we can best keep public expenditure infuture years in proper relationship to the growth of our national product.&quot;3. The report by the Treasury to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which hadbeen extensively considered by the 24-Department Public Expenditure survey committee, entitled &quot; Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62 to 1965-66 &quot;,was submitted to the Cabinet by the Chancellor at the end of June under C. (61) 88.4. The report of the Plowden Committee on Control of Public Expenditure(Cmnd. 1432) was published early in July.  The main recommendation was that:Regular surveys should be made of public expenditure as a whole, overa period of years ahead, and in relation to prospective resources; decisionsinvolving substantial future expenditure should be taken in the light of thesesurveys.5. The Cabinet discussions and decisions in July covered both long-term and short-term elements of public expenditure. The specific undertaking about thefuture level of Government expenditure in the Chancellor^ statement on 25th Julywas related to the year 1962-63, presented as part of the process of containing futurepublic expenditure, and in this statement and on 26th July the Chancellor put great weight on bringing public expenditure into a proper relationship with the growth of resources as the Government^ principal contribution to economic growth.6. The Chancellor made proposals in C. (61) 123 for further work on thepreparation of a public expenditure plan up to 1965-66, and these were approvedby the Cabinet on 1st August (C.C. (61) 46th Conclusions, Minute 5).7. The Queen&apos;s Speech emphasised the Government^ purpose of keepingpublic expenditure within limits justified by the national resources.8. Work has proceeded since July in the Public Expenditure survey committee and elsewhere in accordance with the decisions of 1st August. Thememorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, C. (61) 174 on administrative and minor policy savings primarily directed towards 1962-63 but of long-termsignificance too was approved by the Cabinet on 9th November (C.C. (61)61st Conclusions, Minute 2).The Long-Term Expenditure Report9. The report began by an examination of the prospective growth of economic resources in the period to 1965-66, and the future development of the economy.It was decided as a result of this examination to work on the basis of an increaseof output (gross domestic product, G.D.P.) per worker of 2\ per cent, per annum,and of working population by \ per cent., i.e., an increase of 3 per cent, per annum in G.D.P.
10. It was the universal view that this pattern was an optimistic one, for thefollowing reasons:(i) It implied that the balance of payments problem would be solved during these four years despite continuing increases in prices and costs, andby means which permit rapid expansion of the G.D.P. The assumptionwas an increase of nearly 6 per cent, in the average annual rate of expansion of exports of goods&apos; the view of the Board of Trade wasthat this average could not be expected to be more than 3  per cent.(ii) The rate of increase of 2\ per cent, per annum in the G.D.P. per workerwould require a faster pace than the average of about 2 per cent, perannum in the previous decade.(iii) To make room for the exports and private investment required to createand sustain the economic growth which was postulated, and the public expenditure at 42-1 per cent, of G.N.P., it would be necessary for thepublic to be willing to consume a smaller proportion of its extra incomethan it had done before (2 -1 per cent, increase per annum of consumptionper head compared with 2-8 per cent, per annum in 1952-60).11. On all these scores the Report was held to be optimistic: the Treasurytook the view that it would be wrong to make a &quot; plan &quot; on a lower rate ofeconomic growth (for this would itself create its own inconsistencies and difficulties). The right course, the Report said, was to try to conquer the balanceof payments limitation in the next four or five years rather than to try to limit the economy to conform with it.12.   This led to the following conclusions:(a) If public expenditure is to be planned on the basis of 2\ per cent, annual average rate of growth of G.D.P. per worker, this would mean thatall governmental policies would have to be directed to strengthen thecompetitiveness of the economy the common essential condition for growth and solvency.(b) In particular, the development of public expenditure, both in size and incomposition, should be such as to support this aim so far aspracticable the power of the purse may well be the most powerfulweapon at the Governments disposal for this purpose.(c) The prospects of achieving this objective would be greatly improved ifthe average rate of increase of wages and salaries could be held to no more than the growth of G.D.P. per worker.   .13. The Report then went on to consider the shape and impact of public expenditure, expounding the layout, the way in which it had developed in the1950s (with the reorientation of public expenditure away from defence and housing and towards oversea aid, assistance to industry and science, transport (road and rail), education and pensions).14. It showed the importance for the G.N.P. of the efficiency with whichthe public sector (employing nearly 6 million people and carrying out over 40 percent, of the nation&apos;s investment) conducts its business: the first element in anyplan for the public sector and its expenditure, the Report said, was to build upthe efficiency of the resources engaged in the public sector.15. The Report then examined the impact of public expenditure on the productivity and competitive power of the private sector through the framework of services which it provides, through the amount and nature of the resources which it pre-empts from the total national resources, and through the effect of thedirection of public expenditure on the distribution of resources in the private sector, and on the extent to which it encourages labour and capital to go wherethey will yield the best return. These were analysed one by one, with particular reference to the features of the layout of public expenditure which had beencontributory factors in the indifferent competitive power of the national economy in recent years.16. Against this. background of the prospective growth of the national resources, and of the impact of public expenditure upon the rate of growth, theReport proceeded to examine the future course of each main block of publicCONFIDENTIAL60207 b 3
expenditure. To contain public expenditure within the Cabinet&apos;s desideratum of42^ per cent, of the G.N.P., on the optimistic figure of the growth of G.N.P., itwas reckoned to be necessary to limit the increase from 1961-62 to 1965-66 withinabout  1,000 million (at the prices of the first quarter of 1961).17. On present policies, the increase would far exceed  1,000 million. Itwas impossible to give a figure, for some of the present policies (e.g., agriculturalsubsidies) are open-ended commitments, and it was impossible rationally to predictwhat they would be in five years&apos; time. Experience has shown, moreover, that&quot; on present policies &quot; there is a continuous flow of new spending proposals sothat any forecast based on what is now known is bound to be greatly exceeded.It seemed unrealistic, therefore, to approach the problem by taking the programmes one by one, making a prediction of what would happen to each &quot; on present policies &quot;, and then proposing adjustments to bring the aggregate increasewithin the  1,000 million.18. Instead, a policy was suggested for each main block of expenditure, withthe intention of making up a set of policies that would in the end result inexpenditures which would not in the aggregate exceed the additional  1,000 million.It was found that the momentum of public expenditure was so powerful that itwas impossible, even with the optimistic figure of growth of G.N.P., to make apractical plan which conformed to the 42-1- per cent. Proposals were put forwardwhich, with an appropriate allowance for contingencies, would involve increases of about  1,100 million instead of the  1,000 million consistent with the 42-1 per cent.19. This failure put further emphasis on the conclusions in paragraph 12above.20. The proposals were in some cases for quantitative limits for 1965-66 andin others for changes in policy in qualitative terms. The magnitudes were shownin the following table (the figures are those given in the Report of the public expenditure Survey Committee: in some cases, e.g., agriculture and aid, the 1961-62figures have since changed):Proposed increase(at 1st quarter, 19611961-62 pay and prices)  million   millionQuantitative limits (large items)Defence budget..................        1,680 125Civil investment         ...............        1,692 (258)Local education (expenditure for general grantX1)    ...          770 100Hospital services^)     ...............          508 40Local health and welfare services(l).........          108 13National insurance and war pensions       ......        1,266 91Family allowances      ...............          134 7Total...................   6,158 634Other expendituresOversea aid programme        ......Assistance to industry (public and private)Agricultural support and servicesExecutive Council services, etc.Other expenditures(2).........Debt interest    ...      ......Miscellaneous, adjustments, etc.Contingency allowance ......Total public expenditure       .........       10,280 1,104(x) Current expenditure: capital is included in civil investment.(2) These include the Atomic Energy Authority, the Research Councils, universities, housing subsidies, road maintenance, police, national assistance, central and local government administration and a large number of smaller services.   Provision has been made for these on a basis of restraint.21. The Treasury proposals in the Report for the main items of expenditure were as follows:(i) The policy outlined in the White Paper on the Economic and financial obligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337) should beenergetically pursued.108&quot;)247 j277 ^2,6872341,741 J1,225\210/85135250
(ii) Stringent criteria should be required to justify proposals for government assistance to private industry. Proposals of this kind involving somesignificant departure should be examined inter-departmentally before a decision is taken.(iii) Whatever measures are necessary should be taken to contain the annualbill for agricultural support and services within the general area of theestimated cost for 1961-62 namely,  277 million.(iv) The defence budget for 1965-66 should not exceed the estimated level for1961-62 by more than  125 million at 1st quarter (say February), 1961prices, with special reference to reducing direct oversea military expenditure and demands on high-quality research and industrial effort.(v) The rate of growth of local authorities&apos; current expenditure on education should be limited to 3 per cent, per annum, which would permit anincrease by 1965-66 of  100 million at February 1961 prices over theestimated level of expenditure in 1961-62.(vi) The rate of growth of hospital running costs should be limited to 2 per cent.per annum, which would permit an increase by 1965-66 of  40 million at February 1961 prices over the estimated level of expenditure in19.61-62.(vii) The rate of growth of expenditure on the local health services should notexceed 2 per cent, per annum, giving an increase by 1965-66 of 6^ million at February 1961 prices over the estimated level ofexpenditure in 1961-62: expenditure on the local welfare services in1965-66 should not exceed by more than  6^ million at February 1961prices the estimated level of expenditure in 1961-62.(viii) There should be no widening of the scope of National Insurance and other benefits and assistance. (It was implied in the report that the rates ofbenefit would, in accordance with present Government policy, risebroadly in line with earnings.)22. There was reference to the Annual Review of Public Investment, showingits relevance to the long-term public expenditure plan, both as direct expenditure(a level of  1,950 million of public investment was allowed for 1965-66 in the tableshown above, an increase of  200 million over 1961-62) and because of its indirecteffect upon the growth of current expenditure.Subsequent Actiosi23. The following action has been taken on the proposals set out inparagraph 21 above. ----- -   - -24. Nationalised industries. On 26th July, the Chancellor of the Exchequerannounced the Government^ policy of leaving these industries as much freedomand responsibility as possible in fixing their prices; and of allowing the industries the investment which is agreed to be required for attaining their financial targets and providing essential supplies and services. He said that the White Paper policy would lead to more effective concentration upon productive:efficiency.in..the useboth of labour and capital; and that as a result of increased efficiency and higher earnings the calls on Exchequer finance were expected to be progressivelyand substantially reduced over the next five years.     .25. The negotiation of financial targets with the gas arid electricity industrieshas proceeded satisfactorily; and the Post Office charges have been raised toprevent an additional drain on the Exchequer. But for the coal industry an unsatisfactory position is being revealed, and the Exchequer is heavily anddangerously at risk. .....-&apos; -        - - :v. v 26. The deficit of the,British Transport Commission has again.increasedthis year and there seems no early prospect of the railways managing without asubstantial Exchequer subsidy. The extent of the assistance required over thenext few years, will depend to a substantial degree on the efforts, of the newmanagement to increase the efficiency of the industry and to rationalise its size.The Commission have put in hand a. comprehensive series of traffic studies, andthe new Transport Bill will give the railways a substantial measure of commercialfreedom, notably in fares and charges&apos;. - &apos;
27. Assistance to Industry. On 26th July, the Chancellor said that new commitments for assistance could be justified only if they can be shown to makeimportant contributions to competitiveness and national efficiency which can besecured in no other way; and that if any new proposals came forward theGovernment would apply this criterion stringently. He made it clear that theGovernment would continue to use their powers vigorously to deal with localities in which any serious lack of employment opportunities arose.28. The Public Expenditure Survey Committee are preparing a report on the criteria for such assistance in accordance with the Cabinet decision of 1st Augustreferred to above. Meanwhile, the Cunard (Q.3) project has been abandoned, witha probable saving of  15 million loan and a grant of over  3 million.29. Agriculture. On 25th July the Chancellor announced that theGovernment would have to look critically at the level of agricultural support duringthe 1962 Review. Meanwhile the cost in 1961-62, put at  277 million in the Reportof the Public Expenditure Survey Committee, is expected to rise to about  360million.30. Defence.-The proposed policy was incorporated in the Prime MinistersDirective. In addition, discussions have started with Germany about some relief on overseas costs there.31. Education. This is now before Ministers. The difference between the3 per cent, rate of growth in local authority current expenditure in the proposals and the increase of about A\ per cent, implicit in present policy is about  50 million a year of current expenditure.32. National Health Service-The Cabinet decided (C.C. (61) 46thConclusions, Minute 5) that the growth of current expenditure on the hospital service, the Executive Council services, and the local health and welfare services will for the next four years be planned within a financial limit for Great britain of an increase of  80 million (at the pay and prices of the first quarter of 1961)over the estimated figure of  850 million for 1961-62: i.e., an increase of about\ per cent, per annum in real terms over the whole of Health Service expenditure.Within the total the Health Ministers would have some flexibility between thevarious elements of Health Service expenditure and (within moderate amounts)take account of savings achieved in it. The application of this decision is subjectto consultation between the Health Departments and the Treasury.33.   Benefits. No action involved.34. Public Investment. Decisions in 1962-63 were taken by the Cabinet(C.C. (61) 46th Conclusions, Minute 5), and a firm five-year road programme wasdecided upon and announced. The report from the Public Expenditure survey committee on investment in 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66, was circulated by theChief Secretary, Treasury, to the Cabinet and his memorandum C. (61) 218.35. The Departments&apos; proposals are in the aggregate  2,000 million for1963-64,  2,040 million in 1964-65 and  2,065 million in 1965-66. The proposalsfor public expenditure in the Report were based upon a figure of  1,950 million in 1965-66.36. Administrative and Minor Policy Savings. The Cabinet have approved the proposals in a report by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee, circulatedby the Chief Secretary, Treasury, with C. (61) 174. This provides for savings of 14f million in 1962-63, but some of this saving will be permanent, and will reducethe long-term aggregate of expenditure.37. Nutritional Services. The savings of  36 million a year which wouldresult from the abolition of the welfare milk subsidy for families of less than fourchildren and the increase in the price of school meals to Is. 6d., following from thediscussion of C. (61) 209, would be a continuing saving.January 1962.
