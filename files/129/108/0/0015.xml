2 Qth January. 1962COPY NO.  %&apos;CABINETLAOSMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe ProblemI invite my colleagues to consider the situation which will arise in the near future if the Geneva Conference breaks down.Present Position2.        The international agreement which has been reached in Genevais based on the understanding that a Government of National Unity will be formed in Laos from the three principal parties, under the leadership of Prince Souvanna Phouma.   Without this understanding agreement wouldnot have been reached.   Prince Boun Oum and General Phourai are nowsaying that they are no longer willing to take part in such a Governmentand that they consider that Prince Souvanna Phouma should withdraw from the political scene in favour of a Government to be headed by theKing of Laos.   They thus propose a different basis from that on which thefourteen nations in Geneva have been working, and the CommunistPowers will not wish to accept it.3.        The reasons for this development are that General Phoumi isunwilling to run the risk of losing his personal power by entering agovernment in which he would no longer control the army.   Rather than this he would prefer to get Prince Souvanna Phouma to leave Laos andto have a direct confrontation with the Communists, perhaps leading tohostilities in which the Americans would be obliged to intervene ratherthan see La.os overrun.   We and the Americans have told General Phoumithat he ought to accept Prince Souvanna Phouma&apos;s terms for a new government and can do so without running prohibitive risks.4.        The Soviet Co-chairman has warned us that we are now facingan extremely dangerous situation which may lead to war.   He has asked us whether we think that the Conference might be able to reach a settle-ment for Laos without the participation of Prince Boun Oum and GeneralPhoumi.     The difficulty about this is that a settlement in which they donot participate will leave General Phoumi free to withdraw the Laotianarmy into the South and split the Kingdom, or to stage a fresh coup d&apos;etat.Meanwhile the Russians are doubtful as to whether it will be possibleto maintain the ceasefire;  they probably fear that the North Vietnameseand the Pathet Lao will precipitate fresh fighting.-1-
kj^mediateJPoljcy5.        I think that the first step to remedy this situation must be a.renewed effort to get a unified Laotian Government under Prince SouvannaPhouma.   The likelihood of General Phoumi frustrating this depends on whether he thinks that in the last resort he will continue to get american support if he forces a breakdown of the Geneva Conference.   He has alreadybeen warned by the United States Assistant Secretary of State for far eastern Affairs, Mr. Harriman, that he will not, and that insteadhe will find his army deprived of supplies and facilities.   He may wellconsider that the Americans are bluffing and that if he holds out theywill eventually have to support him rather than risk seeing the Laotianarmy disintegrate and the right-wing in Laos collapse.   It is therefore essential that the Americans should take some token action against thearmy to show that they really mean business.     They have not yetdone this - they fear that once they start they will have to carry through a long test of strength with General Phoumi which could seriously weaken the army.   This is not the view of our Ambassador and other foreignobservers who think that General Fhoumi will rapidly give way.6.        It is still just possible that Mr. Harriman&apos;s warnings will bring General Phoumi to reason.   This should become clear in Genevaover the weekend.   But if our attempts fail and negotiations for theformation of a government are abandoned, it will be impossible to keepthe Geneva Conference going.   If we lose the Conference we must try atleast to ensure that the machinery of the Co-chairmen is kept in being to prevent a renewal of fighting.   I would hope to reach an agreementwith the Soviet Co-chairman that he would restrain his allies and thePathet Lao from any breach of the ceasefire;   in return we would obtainfor the Russians an assurance from the Americans that they would exertsimilar control over the Thais, South Vietnamese and General Fhoumi.Such an arrangement, however, could not be expected to last for very long,and American pressure would have to continue to be applied toGeneral Phoumi in the hopes of forcing the Vientiane Government intofresh willingness to join a unified government under Prince SouvannaPhouma.7.        The third and final stage would be if the ceasefire broke downand hostilities began.   Although the Americans have told General Phoumithat they will not support him if he takes the initiative in provokinghostilities, it is unlikely that fighting would begin in a clear-cut manner and it might be difficult to pin the blame on General Phoumi.   whatever the circumstances in which the war breaks out again, if General Phoumiis eventually driven back (as in the end would almost certainly - happen)it will be extremely difficult for the Americans to stand by and watchLaos being overrun.     They do not at present know what they would doin such circumstances.     The President&apos;s instructions to Mr. Harrimanare:- &quot;(i)    That he should not allow Laos to be overrun by thePathet Lao armies.(ii)     That he should by all means avoid the involvementof American troops in Laos.-2-
These instructions may prove hard to reconcile.    If the Americans dointervene there will be an appeal for action by the South East Asia treaty organisation (SEATO) and we shall have to consider whether to take part or not.Our Cjommifcrn^nts^8. Our own general commitment arises from our membership ofSEATO.    Under Article 4 we are obliged to &quot;act to meet the commondanger in accordance with (our) constitutional processes&quot; in the eventof aggression by means of an armed attack against Laos.     Eut thiswould only apply strictly in the event of North Vietnamese interventionidentifiable as an armed attack from outside, and our obligation in thecase of resumption of action with the Fathet Lao not involving this wouldbe limited to &quot;consulting immediately in order to agree on the measureswhich should be taken for the common defence&quot;.    However, when thePrime Minister visited President Kennedy at Key West in March, 1961,Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreed that in the event of American inter-vention in Laos British forces would participate.    But this was for the specific and express purpose of keeping a foothold in Laos until a negotiation could be started.     The situation has radically changed since then - international agreement has been reached and a settlement of thecivil war is being obstructed only by the refusal of the Vientiane Govern-ment to participate.    While this group has reason for viewing with somesuspicion the settlement which has been offered, I do not believe thattheir refusal to accept it is justified.9. Military plans have been worked out by SEATO for intervention in Laos and the Chiefs of Staff and the British Defence Co-co-ordination committee, Far East, have detailed plans for the movement of Britishtroops.    British forces could be in position in Laos within ten days ofthe decision to intervene.10. We must consider whether we should now make our own positionquite clear to the Americans.    Any explanation might cover the follow-ing points:-(i)  We believe that the refusal of the Vientiane Governmentto join a Government of National Unity underPrince Souvanna Phouma is based on the belief thatthe West will not abandon them if negotiations breakdown as a result of their obstinacy.     We are there-fore grateful for the efforts which the americans have made to convince General Phoumi that this isnot the case.    We believe, however, that some definite sanctions will have to be taken now if theGeneral is to be convinced that the Americans reallymean what they say.SEGRET
sT(ii)   We have been re-examining our attitude with regard toLaos in the light of the present situation.    Ourdifficulty arises from the fact that there is no longera rational and representative Government in Laoswith whom we can discuss the application of our commitments to their country.    Our relations arein the hands of General Phoumi who is acting as anindependent autocratic ruler without regard to the safety and welfare of the Kingdom of Laos.     Weshall therefore need to consider whether anyresumption of hostilities may be held to be primarily the result of Communist aggression orwhether it arises from the refusal of General Phoumito agree to a reasonable settlement.    Apart fromany difficulties we might have to face in the united nations, there would.be the practical difficultyof our relations with Malaya and our securitytreaty with the Malayan Government.     We must therefore make it plain that we can make noadvance commitments of any kind as to how wewould act if hostilities begin again.11.     The advantages of such a message would be that in reachingdifficult decisions in the near future the Americans ought to knowexactly what is our present position - it would be unfair to spring achange of front on them at the last moment.    The disadvantage isthat it may upset them and diminish our power to influence their decisions.Recommendations12. (i)    We should follow the line of policy laid down inparagraphs 5 and 6 above.We should decide whether to send a message to the President in the light of developmentsat Geneva over the weekend.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.19th January, 1962.-4.
