March,- 1962CABINETEUROPEAN AND AS IAN FARMING IN KENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues asked for a memorandum showing how theEuropean land interests in Kenya were divided between the largercommercial estates and the smaller mixed farms whose transfer toAfrican ownership was likely to be demanded (C. C. (62) 20th Conclusions,Minute 4).   I hope that the information given below provides what theyhave in mind.COPY NO. &apos;2. The European and Asian farming area in Kenya consists of3, 600 agricultural holdings of 20 acres or more and in total covers7. 7 million acres, of which 7.4 million acres are in the Highlands.Sizes of holdings vary however between 268 of between 20 and 50 acresup to 11 of 50, 000 acres or over.   The former category representssemi-agricultural holdings on which a small amount of specialisedagriculture is carried out as a means of supplementing pensions or small private incomes, while the other end of the scale representslarge beef ranches in semi-arid areas.   The breakdown by categoriesis as follows: -I. Number of Holdings(a) Holdings devoted wholly or mainly tothe plantation crops of sisal, coffee,tea, sugar and wattle......,............ 550(b) Holdings devoted wholly to livestock.......... 370(c) Holdings practising one form or another of mixed farming     ................ 2,680TOTAL 3,600.II.

The above figures have been obtained from Kenya Governmentpublications and the report on the damage to agriculture caused by therecent floods and on the measures needed to revive the industry by&apos;a committee under the chairmanship of Lord Delamere.   There are nostatistics showing the extent to which mixed farms - category (c) above -are held by individuals;   however, of the 3,600 holdings, 750 holdingscomprising 3. 7 million acres, are owned by companies.   It can alsobe assumed that farms of under 2,500 acres are mainly held by individuals, partnerships and private companies.   In I960 there were,930 such holdings, comprising 2,350,000 acres, of which 291,000acres were forests and other unclassified land.   Taking average values of  15 an acre for arable,  100 for permanent crops, and  5 for the otherca/tegories, the total value of the mixed farming land held in individualtenure is of the order of  30- 35 million.R.M.Colonial Office, S.
