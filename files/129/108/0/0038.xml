Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1962C (62) 38 Copy No. 5 026 th February, 1962CABINETUNIVERSITY EXPANSION AND UNIVERSITY salaries memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home deparment during their discussion of university salaries the Cabinet were informed thatthe University Grants Committee had submitted to the Treasury a programme for university expansion involving a 56 per cent, increase in university staffs over thefive years 1962-67 (C.C. (62) 5th Conclusions, Minute 7). It was suggested that ifapproval could not be given for substantial increases in the salaries of unversity teachers the expansion programme could not be carried out and would have to be revised, possibly with lasting damage to the relations between the Governmentand the universities. Subsequently, by arrangement with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, the Committee on Education Policy examined the expansion plan and,in the light of their conclusions on that matter, they also considered the salariesproblem further.University Expansion, 1962-672. The proposals put forward by the University Grants Committee wouldinvolve an increase in total public expenditure on the universities, including capitalexpenditure and student awards, from  104 million in 1961-62 to about  165 million in 1966-67. This increase of some 60 per cent, in expenditure would cater for a36 per cent, increase in student numbers, from about 110,000 this year to 150,000five years hence. The Committee on Education Policy considered that it would be inadvisable to seek to reduce the number of student places below the 150,000proposed for 1966-67. Savings could, however, be obtained by avoiding duringthe quinquennium expenditure proposed by the University Grants Committee forthe purpose of making good the slight deterioration in the ratio of students to staffwhich had occurred in the past few years, and by aiming at 170,000 places by 1973rather than 1970-71, which would affect the rate of new building during the later years of the forthcoming quinquennium. The effect of these suggested savings would be to reduce the total public expenditure on the universities in 1966-67 toaround  155 million. It is, however, only the recurrent grant element within this figure which has to be settled and announced shortly, and the amount of recurrentgrant for 1966-67 corresponding to a programme of this kind would be about 75 million, the exact figure depending on the amount of non-staff costs per student,which I understand the Chief Secretary is pursuing further with the university grants Committee. The Chief Secretary would work out and announce, within the framework of a Cabinet decision on the above lines, amounts of recurrent grant for each of the five academic years 1962-63 to 1966-67.3. The Chief Secretary reported the Committee&apos;s provisional views to theUniversity Grants Committee, who expressed regret if &apos; there could be no improvement in the student / staff ratio during the next five years, but believed thatthe universities would understand and accept the reasons; the University GrantsCommittee added that, in their view, the expansion of the universities on this scalewas practicable provided that the salaries of university teachers were madesufficiently attractive to secure the necessary increase in staff.60464
University Salaries/4. The Cabinet will recall that the University Grants Committee last Julyreported to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that an increase in salaries averaging17 per cent, was essential to enable sufficient staff to-.be recruited for the proposedexpansion. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, informed the Cabinet in January thathe felt unable to accept this but that, in his view, if the staff were to be recruited,it might be reasonable to approve an increase of 8-9 per cent, from 1st August, 1962,distributed so as to increase the attractiveness of the two lowest grades- whileproviding some increase for the higher posts. Before coming to.a conclusion.onthis matter, the Cabinet felt that they should have details of the opening salarieswhich graduates could command at present in the fields open to them in industry,the civil service and the teaching profession outside the universities. information on these points is set out in the Annex to this paper.5. When the Committee on Education Policy considered salaries on16th February, they had before them the information given in the Annex. Theyfully accepted that there was a case for a substantial increase to bring universitysalaries into line with salaries in the rest of the teaching-profession. They, allowedfull weight to the consideration that university salaries were in some respectsspecial university teachers had no right to go to arbitration; there was someelement of pre-pause commitment to them; and there was a special expansionproblem. But the feeling of most members of the Committee was that, whatever the force of these points, to announce an increase of 8-9 per cent, at the present stage would seriously damage the Governmenfs incomes policy. Only: a few days before, the railwaymen had been told that the Government accepted that a case had been made for a larger increase in their wages than 3 per cent, but that thiswas not possible in the country&apos;s economic situation this year. On the other hand,the Lord President of the Council argued that it would be ridiculous to give alarge increase in pay to all other classes of teachers but not to those in the universities and that it was inappropriate to apply the incomes policy blindly tothe special problem of university teachers, considering the paramount importanceof the university expansion. He thought that if the Government gave a firm leadit would be generally accepted that the position of university teachers was quite/different from that of wage earners.6. The majority view of the Committee was that, in view of the overriding importance of securing restraint in incomes this year, it would be right to announce that only 3 per cent, could be given to university teachers, effective from 1st;April,while making it clear that salaries would be further considered in the light ot altcircumstances at this time next year. I undertook, however, that in reporting this;view to the Cabinet I would state that the Lord President of the Council would prefer that there should be a substantial increase in university salaries.this.year.7. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, has since, I understand, seen the Chairmanof the University Grants Committee and communicated the present position tohim in confidence (the next meeting of the Committee is not until 15th March).The Chairman cannot be sure whether, if. the Government decide on 3 per cent.,the Committee will wish to use it entirely for the recruitment grades. (Lecturers andAssistant Lecturers), giving nothing to the higher grades. He has no doubt, however,that the Committee will need to pursue further with the Vice-Chancellors the possible effects of any salary decision on the expansion programme, and before that is donehe thinks (and the. Chief Secretary, Treasury, agrees) that an announcement of the.Governmenfs decision should he made.R. A. B.&apos;Home Office, S.W. 1,26th February, 1962,
