THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. January 1962 &apos;C&apos;^9 Copy No..   5712th January, 1962CABINETINCOMES POLICY: THE FUTURE OF ARBITRATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have discussed the attached memorandumby the Minister of Labour covering a paper by officials on the function ofarbitration as part of the machinery for settling wages and salaries (Annex A). TheCommittee also had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Education,which is attached as Annex B.2. Although arbitration is directly responsible for settling only a small percentage of disputes over the whole field (but a much higher proportion in theCivil Service), it is clearly important to ensure that Government policy on incomes should not be undermined by excessive arbitration awards.3. In considering the part which arbitration should play, particularly in the intermediate phase following the end of the wage &quot; pause &quot;, we should consider thefollowing four alternatives:(i) We could introduce legislation to impose an obligation on arbitrators totake into account the national interest when deciding their awards.Since recourse to arbitration is a voluntary matter in this country, theeffect of such a step would be that few, if any, trade union negotiatorswould agree to take their cases to arbitration. The system would therefore cease to be a method of settling disputes unless the government took the further step of making recourse to arbitration compulsory. Itis certain that the British Employers&apos; Confederation would join the tradeunions in condemning the introduction of statutory control intoarbitration.(ii) During the intermediate phase the Government might limit the implementation of arbitration awards in the public sector to an amount in their view consistent with the interim national incomes policy. Theadvantage of this course would be that, without controversial legislation,the Government would retain control over pay increases in the public sector and set an example to the private sector. There are, however,powerful arguments against this course. First, it could not really berepresented as the restoration of independent arbitration. Secondly,it would certainly reduce the willingness of the Trades Union congress to co-operate in the work of the National Economic development council. Thirdly, the Civil Service unions have already been given an assurance that arbitration arrangements will be restored at the end ofthe &quot; pause &quot;. To go back on that assurance would not only increasebad staff relations in the Civil Service, but would result in a piling up of salary increases arising from unimplemented arbitration awards, to the growing embarrassment of the Government. (These arguments areexamined in greater detail in the memorandum.i(C. (62) 16) by the chief secretary, Treasury.)A more general argument against this course is that it ignores the factthat comparability with outside occupations is the only fair basis for civil Service pay. This principle goes back many years before theReport of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service, 1953-55, under theSECRET60265 b
chairmanship of Sir Raymond Priestley. Under this system salaries inthe public sector, especially the Civil Service, follow pay increases in theprivate sector. A policy of holding down the public sector maynot succeed in moderating increases in the private sector, but maymerely result in widening the differentials between the two groups. Thereal objective of the Governmenfs policy should be to restrain pay increases in the private sector, and in consequence, through the doctrine of comparability, pay increases in the public sector will also bemoderated.(iii) The Government might say that they were prepared in principle to honour arbitration awards in the civil service, but should add that a level of wages based on fair comparison with outside occupations wasa long-term objective. It should be accepted as part of the restorationof arbitration arrangements that the civil service must move more slowlytowards those objectives, at a pace consistent with the growth of national productivity. They would serve notice on all concerned that in anyarbitration proceedings the employers (i.e., the Government) wouldargue the case not only on comparability but more particularly on what could be afforded and on what the effect would be by an award in eachcase upon other awards on wages and upon the inflationary effects tothe economy generally. If a public statement were made on these linesit might help to create an atmosphere which would affect the attitudesof arbitrators working in the rest of the public sector and in private industry. However, the Government would not remain immune fromaccusations by unions both in the public and private sectors that theywere interfering with the freedom of arbitration.(iv) The Government might restrict its action to secure arbitration awardsconsistent with the national interest to the proposals put forward bythe Minister of Labour in the memorandum attached at Annex A, i.e., (a)to publish a digest of current factual economic information and make itgenerally available to negotiators and arbitrators with a view to creatingan informed opinion about the national interest in the level at whichincomes are settled. Eventually this digest might be produced by theNational Economic Development Council, but pending the setting up ofthat body it might be produced by the Ministry of Labour; (b) tostrengthen the secretariat of arbitration bodies so that the relevanteconomic facts concerning the national interest are brought to thenotice of arbitrators when they are considering the cases submitted bythe parties to a dispute.If this course were followed, it could hardly be alleged that theGovernment were interfering with the freedom of arbitrators to reachtheir own decisions. It could of course be combined with the othercourses mentioned above.4. The Economic Policy Committee were generally agreed that an attempt tointroduce statutory controls on arbitration awards would not lead to a solution ofour difficulties. Discussion of the remaining alternatives showed some division ofopinion on the best course to follow in present circumstances. In view of my discussions with the Trades Union Congress about their participation in the work ofnational planning, a decision on the line we should take about the scope ofarbitration during the intermediate phase is urgent and I should welcome the viewsof my colleagues in the Cabinet on this matter.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,12 th January, 1962
secret      ^ANNEX AINCOMES POLICY: THE FUTURE OF ARBITRATIONMemorandum by the Minister of labour the attached paper has been prepared by my officials in consultation with theTreasury and other interested departments. It deals with arbitration as part of themachinery for the settlement of wages and salaries, and is intended like the paper on incomes policy which the Chancellor circulated at the meeting of Cabinet on14th December (C.C. (6.1) 74th Conclusions, Minute 6) as a basis for furtherconsideration of and consultation on future arrangements.2. During the pause we have withdrawn the timing of pay increases from thescope of arbitration in the Civil Service. This has roused general distrust of the government&apos;s attitude towards arbitration. We must remove this if we wantemployers and trade unions to use arbitration when they cannot reach agreement by negotiation. Our system of voluntary arbitration works on the basis of consentby both parties, and will only be acceptable if arbitration is clearly recognised as independent of Government influence.3. Therefore, whatever we might wish, it follows that the Government cannotgive direct guidance to arbitrators about the scale of their awards or about the criteriathey should apply to individual cases. Thus we cannot ensure that awards willinvariably accord exactly with the Governmenfs view on what is required by thenational economic situation. Only a strictly controlled system of compulsory arbitration, coupled with legal restrictions on the scope of free negotiation, could bebrought into line in that way. That is not a practicable course.4. It has been suggested that one way of introducing the national interestinto voluntary arbitration would be to arrange for a third party to be present togive advice or provide information. If this third party were a representative ofthe Government it would be thought that direct Government influence was being brought to bear and this would certainly not be acceptable to the parties. If thethird party were an independent person not associated with the Government thiswould also, I am afraid, be unacceptable to the parties. The trade unions do notbelieve that there is an &quot; independent &quot; view on wages and salaries; there is nobodyabove the battle. There is no equivalent of the amicus curiae who occupies a well-understood position in the law courts. There would be obvious problems aboutselection, appointment and status of a third party. A particular difficulty would arise in the large proportion of cases where the Government are the employers andare presenting their own case to the arbitrator. I am sure that in presentcircumstances it would be impracticable for a third party to appear before anarbitrator to represent the national interest.5. I have looked into the possibility of using existing powers in the industrial courts Act, 1919, to make rules of procedure so as to require arbitrators appointed under the Act to consider certain types of factual information of a wider naturethan might be put to them by the parties. I have been advised by the Law officers that rules with this scope cannot be made under the Act. New legislation wouldbe needed, and it would be highly controversial. If it were introduced I am convinced that the trade unions would not be prepared to use arbitration.6. As I see it, our best hope of progress is to create an atmosphere in whicharbitrators regard it as natural to take into account the national interest and theparties accept it as reasonable that they should do so. This must be part of the widerapproach to the problem of inflation. We have to see that the economic facts of our situation are more widely understood, so that we may create an informed publicopinion which is capable of exerting pressure on any group or section which isdisposed to pursue its own narrow interest. I therefore.welcome the proposal inparagraph 19 of the officials&apos; paper that we should publish a new digest of currentfactual information of the kind that is essential to the assessment whether bynegotiators or arbitrators-of particular wage claims in fair perspective against the broad background of the national interest.7. I propose also to make administrative arrangements to strengthen the secretariat of the Industrial Court and other arbitration bodies.   At present my60265
Department provides, the secretariat for the Industrial Court, the Civil ServiceArbitration Tribunal, all Wages Councils and all ad hoc boards of arbitration aswell as the secretary of the Railways Staff National Tribunal. My officers are alsoresponsible for arranging for one-man arbitrations. A strengthened secretariatcould, therefore, be a powerful influence in co-ordinating arbitrators and ensuring that information about wage movements and other economic developments was brought to their notice.J. H.Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,28th December, 1961.NEGOTIATION AND ARBITRATIONMemorandum by OfficialsGeneralThe Government have indicated that, taking the economy as a whole, it isessential that incomes should not rise faster than productivity if we are to make effective the general desire for high levels of employment, a more rapid rate o/growth, and stable prices. Increases in wages, salaries and profits should be consistent with these economic objectives.2. This paper deals with certain aspects of the settlement of wages and salaries.By whatever method these are settled whether by negotiation, arbitration or statutory wage fixing machinery the results affect not only the parties directly concerned but the continued prosperity and growth of the whole economy. all who are responsible for the settlement of wages and salaries have an obligation toconsider, and let it be seen that they have considered, the wider implications oftheir decisions.Negotiation3. There are about 22 million employees in the working population. In roundfigures, the wages, salaries and other conditions of employment of some 5 million of these are settled by direct arrangement between individual workers and their employers and of a further 4 million by statutory wage-fixing machinery. Thewages, salaries and other conditions of employment of the remaining 13 millionemployees in private and nationalised industries, in central and local governmentand elsewhere are the subject of collective bargaining between representatives ofemployers and employees. The great majority of increases of wages and salaries for these 13 million employees are the outcome of settlements reached by agreementthrough negotiation between the two parties. This can be illustrated by referenceto the addition to the wages bill due to increases in weekly rates of wages of the10 million manual workers within this group of 13 million employees. In both 1959and 1960 negotiated agreements accounted for more than 95 per cent, of theaddition. The results of collective bargaining also influence the wages and salariesfixed in other ways.. . 4. From the national point of view, what is significant is the effect of all theseseparate negotiations. It is of the utmost importance that the parties to particularnegotiations should not only take account of the interests of those immediatelyaffected but should recognise a responsibility to apply to their particular circumstances and agreements the principle that increases in incomes should notexceed increases in national productivity.      .&apos;Statutory tVage Fixing Machinery        .   - , .v-. *5. The wages, salaries and conditions of employment of over 4 millionemployees in the industries covered by Wages Councils and: the Agricultural WagesBoards are settled through statutory arrangements. These arrangements providefor negotiation between representatives of employers and employees with theassistance of independent members who can exercise a deciding voice in the event
SECRET5of disagreement between the two parties. The arrangements combine features of negotiation and arbitration and it is appropriate, therefore, that those responsiblefor working these arrangements should also have regard to the principle that increases in incomes should be related to increases in national productivity.Arbitration - -6. Differences which are not settled by negotiation can be referred byagreement to independent arbitration. The circumstances in which they are referred, the terms of reference and the particular type of arbitration machineryused are matters for the parties. In a minority of industries, but including some very important ones particularly in the public sector, there is a standing commitment that differences which cannot be settled by negotiation will be referred to arbitration.In some others the question of using arbitration is considered by the parties on each occasion.7. The possibility of arbitration is expressly provided for in national agreements covering about 6 million employees. There are such agreements in private and nationalised industry, the civil service and some local authority services.Where there is no specific provision on the subject arbitration is nevertheless usedfrom time to time in other industries and services when the parties agree that it is appropriate.8. Many industries and services make use of the statutory provisions for arbitration contained in the Conciliation Act, 1896 and the Industrial Courts Act,1919. Under these Acts a difference can be referred to the Minister of Labourwho may then, if both parties consent, refer the matter for settlement by arbitration.In many cases the parties expressly ask the Minister for arbitration.9. The reference can be to the Industrial Court or to an individual arbitratoror to a board of arbitration. Certain industries and services, including, for example,the railways, coalmining and the civil service have arbitration machinery designedto meet their particular needs.10. Recourse to arbitration is regarded by both parties as justified only ifit is clear that a negotiated settlement cannot be reached, and in industry generallyincreases in wages and salaries are, therefore, determined by arbitration to a verysmall extent. For years previous to 1959, the influence of arbitration was increasedby the statutory provisions of the Industrial Disputes Order. In .1959, afterrevocation of the Order, about 3 per cent, and in 1960 less than 1 per cent, of theaddition to the wages bill due to increases in weekly wage rates of manual workersresulted from arbitration awards; special circumstances, including the disappearanceafter 18 years of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal and the special arrangements which governed reference to it may have tended to reduce the use of arbitrationas a means of fixing wages and salaries in this relatively short period. It must alsobe remembered that arbitration may indirectly affect the outcome of collective bargaining. But these considerations do not materially change the general picture.11. The extent to which arbitration is used however varies greatly betweenemployments. For example, from 1st January, 1959 to 31st October, 1961 theCivil Service Arbitration Tribunal alone dealt with 54 cases out of a total of 249,settled by arbitration under the Conciliation Act, 1896 and the Industrial courts act, 1919. In 1959, 93 per cent, and in 1960, 22 per cent, of the total cash increasein civil service salaries was due to awards by the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal.12. Arbitration provides a peaceful means of settling disputes which has been of great value in avoiding industrial strife The Government attach the highest importance to the maintenance of arrangements whereby disputes are referred byagreement to arbitration. .  i,.;.-. f.   ,.13. This applies with particular force where arbitration, is most frequentlyused. In the summer of 1961 the Government took steps to bring about a pausein wage and salary increases in the civil service and other employments for whichthey are directly responsible. These steps included action to withdraw the timing of pay increases from the terms of reference to arbitration in the civil service andthe National Health Service. The Government decided on this action because intheir view it would do less damage to arbitration than any other course consistent with ensuring a pause in pay increases. The Government took this action on grounds of public policy in the special circumstances of the economic situation.
It was an act for the short term. It is the Governments intention that, as soonas circumstances permit, the timing of improvements in pay, etc., from dates afterthe end of the pause shall be referred to arbitration, as in the past, when it isnecessary to do so.14. The willingness of both parties to go to arbitration and not to takeindustrial action has been based on the recognition that it supplements the processof negotiation and is completely independent of outside influences. The government recognise that arbitration will only operate effectively if arbitrators continue toexercise, and are seen to exercise, complete independence in making their awards.15. Arbitration in the field of wages and salaries is a particular form of thewell-known procedure whereby a referee is invited to decide between the conflictingviews of two parties who have been unable to reconcile their differences by negotiation. The practice of appointing a referee is of long standing in thecommercial field, where it is natural to regard it as an informal and expeditioussubstitute for litigation in the Courts. In such cases the arbitrator is expectedto take cognisance only of the evidence and arguments put before him by theparties, just as if the case had been presented to a Court of Law for a judicialdecision; and the arbitrator is not as a rule concerned with any other views thatmight be taken by other persons not directly involved, nor even with factual information which the two parties have not seen fit to lay before him.16. But decisions affecting wages and salaries have implications for othersbesides the parties to a particular dispute. It is sometimes the practice for theparties to include in their evidence reference to developments in other employmentsand to the effects a wage increase might have on employment, costs, prices and production. Arbitrators are familiar with the possibility however that the partiesmay on occasion make too narrow an approach in pursuing their case. At timesthey have been criticised for dealing only with the particular case before them asa private issue between the two parties concerned, but in the complex economicsituation of the post-war years arbitrators generally have become increasinglyconscious of, and interested in, the wider implications of their awards.17. If in the future we are to keep increases in incomes in line with increases in productivity this consciousness of the wider implications of arbitration awardswill be of crucial importance. Arbitrators must be given an opportunity toconsider all the information necessary to put the particular case before them intoits proper perspective against the broad background of wages movementselsewhere, and other factors affecting the national economic situation. Theymust also have an opportunity to hear the views of the parties on the applicationto their case both of this information and of the general principle that incomes should not increase faster than national productivity.Publication of Factual Information18. The application of this principle in negotiation and arbitration requires that comprehensive factual information on wage rates, earnings, hours of workand other conditions of employment, manpower, prices, production, profits and dividends and other relevant subjects should be readily available for use by theparties in negotiation or when reference is made to arbitration.19. Much of this information is already published. The government propose to supplement it and to make it generally available to employers&apos;associations, trades unions, arbitrators and everyone concerned in a more convenient form by publishing a digest of the information at regular intervals.
SECRET7ANNEX BINCOMES POLICY-THE FUTURE OF ARBITRATIONMemorandum by Minister of EducationMy own feeling about the Minister of Labour&apos;s paper (Annex A) is that apolicy statement on those lines must suffer from the difficulty that we are still atan interim stage in the working out of a national wages policy of which a revisedattitude or rather climate of opinion towards arbitration will form an essential part. But assuming we cannot avoid saying something on the latter subject at thisstage, I would doubt whether we should be well advised to lay such emphasis asthe note by officials does, in paragraph 12, on the importance which we attach tosettlement by arbitration. If this has to be said, I would say it later and lessemphatically after developing (as the note does in paragraph 17) our views onthe way in which arbitrators should act. And I would make it clear that anysuch statement marks an interim view forming part of an interim policy on incomes.2. This said, I welcome the idea of more factual information and the proposalsof the Minister of Labour to strengthen the secretariat of the Industrial Court andother arbitration bodies. We want to see to it that employers generally are putin the best position to play the national hand.3. I am bound, however, to warn my colleagues that the putting out of astatement of this kind, even if somewhat tempered in the way I have suggested,will make it more difficult for me to resist the strong pressures to which it is now clear that I shall be subjected to introduce formal arbitration arrangements into any revised set-up for negotiating teachers&apos; salaries. It may be impossible in any event to resist provision for arbitration between both sides of the burnham committee if, as may happen, a demand for this is supported by the authorities as well as the Teachers&apos; Associations. But if the Government themselves restatetheir belief in arbitration and say that even where we provide the whole of themoney, as in the National Health Service, or are in fact the employer, as withthe Civil Service, we intend to continue to refer cases to arbitration, then it willnot be easy to refuse the same to teachers in the full sense of arbitration betweenthe Burnham Committee and the Government where we are unable to accept aBurnham Report.D. E.Ministry of Education,Curzon Street, W. 1,8th January, 1962.
