C. (62) 1319th January, 1962CABINETCOSTS OF UNITED NATIONS OPERATIONS IN THE CONGOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLast December the General Assembly voted $80 million to finance the Congooperation from November 1961 to June 1962: the United Kingdom&apos;s share will beabout $6 million or just over  2 million. We should normally expect to pay atleast part of our contribution fairly soon, perhaps in the latter part of January.We also owe about  688,000 for the previous financing period of January to october 1961, this being the balance of certain sums held in suspense to offset thecost of services rendered to the United Nations by the Air Ministry (seeparagraph 3 below).2. It has been suggested in Parliament and in the country at large that Weshould discontinue payment of our contributions to the Congo operation, at least until we are satisfied that it is conducted in a responsible manner and in accordancewith the United Nations Charter. There are several arguments against taking this course, however, some of them very strong.  I list them as follows:(i) According to our own declared interpretation of the Charter, we are under a legal obligation to pay these contributions, and our failure todo so would eventually expose us to the penalty of loss of vote in theGeneral Assembly as provided for by Article 19 of the Charter. Wehave recently co-sponsored a resolution in the General Assemblyseeking from the International Court of Justice an advisory opinionon the legal obligation of members to pay their assessed contributions to United Nations operations in the Congo and the Middle East. Adecision not to pay would therefore embarrass us in the proceedings before the Court. Furthermore, there is good reason to expect thatthe Courfs opinion will be affirmative and, if we were meanwhile todefault on our Congo payments, we should be faced with the choice between paying up belatedly or flouting the opinion of the Court.(ii) Our refusal to pay would not, by itself, bring the Congo operation to anend for want of funds. The sale of an issue of United Nations bonds,to which the United States has declared its intention of subscribinggenerously, probably means that sufficient money will be available tocontinue a Congo operation for at least 12 months. A UnitedKingdom default would reduce our ability to influence United Nationsoperations and place us in much the same position as France, whose views on the Congo appear to carry little or no weight outside the&quot; Brazzaville &quot; States.(iii) If the United Kingdom defaults on the Congo account, the United states will be the only one of the five permanent members of the security council continuing to pay. As the recent official talks in Washingtonhave confirmed, the United States Administration attach the greatest importance to our supporting them in providing financial backing forCONFIDENTIAL60286Copy No.     6 printed for the Cabinet.

the United Nations. A default by us would therefore be damaging toour relations with the United States Government. We might also haveto expect that our action would have a profound effect on United Statesopinion Congressional and public leading to a pressure for a partialwithdrawal of United States support for the United Nations. this could only be to the benefit of the Soviet bloc.(iv) Other Commonwealth countries (and not only the New Commonwealth)are strongly behind the United Nations. Our default would undoubtedly damage Commonwealth relations.(y) A default would also call into question our support for the United nations as a whole. It may be that the conduct of the United Nations wouldbecome so intolerable that we would have to withdraw our support; butthat time is not yet and I hope it will not come.(vi) The United Nations maintains a force of 5,000 troops on the Egypt-Israelborder and in a vital position on the Gulf of Aqaba. This force makesan important contribution to the stability of the area as a whole and itis a United Kingdom interest to sustain it; but we should find it moredifficult to resist Soviet or Arab pressure to wind up the operation if wehad ourselves refused to pay our Congo contribution.(vii) To withhold our contribution would certainly provide our balance ofpayments with small, but welcome, relief. It might well, however, forthe reasons given above, do great harm to our own long-term interests.recommendations. For these reasons I recommend that we continue to pay our assessed Congocontributions, at least for the present. I propose, however, that we make paymentsonly in respect of current United Nations expenditure on the Congo from month tomonth, and not in advance. I propose also that we continue to make air supportavailable, on request, to the United Nations and, in particular, to the Nigeriancontingent in the Congo, against repayment; and that, pending reimbursement (weare still negotiating with the United Nations about this), we should continue to holdback a corresponding sum from our Congo contribution.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,18th January, 1962.
