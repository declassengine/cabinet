SoC. (62) 2,9 COPY NO.13th February, 1962CABINETSERVICE FAY AND THE PAY PAUSEMemorandum by the Minister .of defence the Griftft report before 1958 there was much discontent in the Services about pay.There was a general feeling that they were constantly lagging behind theircivilian counterparts.     In that year the Advisory Committee on Recruit-ing under the Chairmanship of Sir James Grigg recommended &quot;that thereshould be an automatic biennial review of pay which should take intoaccount movements in civilian earnings.     . , .   The review should coverpensions also&quot;.    In accepting its findings the then Minister of defence said in the House of Commons - &quot;Our acceptance of the Biennial review should be regarded, and I wish it to be so regarded, by the Services asan honourable undertaking that we intend to maintain that position in thefuture.......   I think it essential that the Services should have&apos;confidence in the fact that their pay and pensions will be maintained ata level which compares with what it might be possible for them to earnin civilian life&quot;.    So far as other ranks are concerned, this reviewconsists of an examination by the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence andthe Service Departments of earnings in industry over a period which inthe case of the current review ended in July, 1961, i.e. , before the paypause was announced.     For officers the yardstick used is the comparable grades of the Home Civil Service.2.        The review has shown - and there is no dispute about this - thatthe justifiable increase for other ranks is about 141; per cent, and thatfor officers 4 per cent.   . Detailed proposals for increases in pay havebeen submitted to the Treasury which, in order to allow a smoothtransition as between other ranks and officers, average 13 per cent for other ranks  and l\ per cent for officers.     Pay, however, is only part of the Serviceman&apos;s basic emoluments comparable with the earnings of a civilian.     The Treasury were therefore also asked to agree to anincrease of the same percentages in marriage allowance.3.        If we were to abandon this recently established procedure weshould, firstly be in a breach of a solemn obligation;  and, secondly,all the old suspicions would be re-awakened that the Forces were once again going to be forced back to the end of the queue.     The increases which have been proposed represent, after all, the extent to which theServices have already fallen behind their civilian opposite numbers.-1-CONFIDENT1AL
The Recruiting Problem4.        Apart from our obligations there is the problem of recruiting.We have just had some four or five good recruiting months but   some of.my colleagues will remember the anxious consideration which we had togive to this matter about twelve months ago.    Since then, we have made our maximum effort but even now we are not out of our difficulties.    Toreach Our minimum target we must continue to do as well as at presentand if we fail to meet our recruiting targets for the beginning of 1963,then the whole Regular Service concept on which our defence policy isbased will be at risk.     I must make it quite plain that, after the most careful consultation with my Service colleagues, the Chiefs of Staff, thePermanent Secretaries and Sir Frederic Hooper, my honorary adviser on recruitment, it seems certain that if we fail to live up to our under-taking on pay, we shall damage recruitment, with all the grave consequences that would flow from failure to meet our minimum targets.Special Position of the services.        It is thus clear that we are faced with a difficult problem.     Itis one that unfortunately cannot be postponed if we are to keep faith withthe Services.     Even in present circumstances I am quite sure that itwould be wrong and unjust to treat the Serviceman as a comparable case to trade unionists or even to the professionals.    Unlike the great bodyof civilian workers, he has no union to advance his claims or protecthis interests.    He is not free to give notice and move to other employ -ment.    He cannot work to rule or strike and indeed in periods ofindustrial unrest may well find himself keeping the life of the nationgoing by working in the docks or providing essential services.    above all, he has entered into a binding contract for a period of years in the belief that the Government will protect his interests.    It may be saidthat some of these considerations apply to other fields of public service,but the fact is that the Services are, and are generally regarded asbeing, in a class apart, and for this reason I believe a case can bemade for treating their pay as a separate issue on the lines indicated inparagraph 5 of the White Paper on incomes policy (Cmnd. 1626):   &quot;it follows that there is no scope in 1962 for more than strictly limitedincreases in wages and salaries.    In many cases there may indeed beno justification at present for any increases at all.     In others theremay be particular circumstances which point the other^way&quot;.How can we handle this situation?5.        I am sure that, even in present circumstances, my colleagues will not wish me to repudiate the machinery which has been built upsince the Grigg R.eport.     If this is so, then the problem is how to givethe Services increases which they can be expected to accept as fulfillingthe Grigg procedure without creating an unacceptable breach in theGovernments incomes policy.    In my view, the least that should bedone is to give them the increases in pay which I have proposed to theTreasury and which average 13 per cent for other ranks and l\ per cent for officers.    For my part, I should be prepared, on this occasion,-2-confidential
not to press for the payment of proportionate increases in marriage allowance.     We must, however, regard the Servicemanrs equivalent of civilian wages as including not only his pay but his marriage allowance and ration allowance, in which case we are entitled to relate the increases to the sum total of these emoluments.     Thus we can fairly state the increases as respectively 9. 5 per cent and 5. 3 per cent.     I consider, asdo the Service Ministers, that we should be entirely justified, even inpresent circumstances, in proceeding with a settlement on this basis andthat it could be defended.     But we are anxious to go aa far as wepossibly can at this time to buttress the Governmenfs policy of wage restraint.     I am therefore prepared on this occasion to agree that,while making it clear that we are carrying out the Grigg pledge, we feel it right in the special circumstances of this year to implement it only tothe extent of paying half of the amount due on 1st April, 1962,the balance to be paid with effect from 1st April, 1963.     This means, sofar as other ranks are concerned, that they would receive 4-f per centon 1st April this year.     This is a considerable sacrifice and I mustwarn my colleagues that it may have a very serious effect on recruit-ment, but I think it right to offer it in an attempt to maintain -the fullforce of the policy of restraint.Cost of Pay proposals.        The cost of the increases which I have proposed,   includingproportionate increases in pensions, would be approximately  14 million during the next financial year.Service Doctors8.        There is a special problem relating to the pay of medical officers of the Services on which I shall be submitting separateproposals as soon as possible.recommendation .        I ask my colleagues to agree:-(a) that the Government should make clear their intention of carrying out their pledge tomaintain the biennial review system;(b) that the increase in Service emolumentsshould be 9. 5 per cent for other ranks and 5. 3 per cent for officers, to be spread-equally over two years.H.
