[&apos;1iPHIS DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CJ62L45 COPY NO. ,2nd March, 1962CABINETTj^ EFFECT ON HOUSEHOLDERS. OF REVALUATIONFOR RATES IN 1963Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i agree with the general conclusion reached by the Minister of housing and Local Government in C.(62) 33 that the overall resultof the valuation for rates in 1963 is comforting.    But this, of course,doesn&apos;t help those who are on the wrong side of the average and it isunfortunate that these places, largely seaside resorts, are those inwhich we have a particular interest.    I entirely agree that no casecan be made out for a general de-rating order but it seems to methat there are very strong arguments indeed for making some provision where the change in the householders share amounts to more than say 10 per cent.     This would involve threatened-ee counties and seven county boroughs, a list of which, together with the percentage increases, is annexed.2.        This revaluation first takes practical effect in 1963/64 andI would suggest that we should taper the increase to the householdersover a period of perhaps three years.     Certainly we will beexpected to do this.    It is quite true, as the Minister&apos;s paper says,that his predecessor told the House that an increase of 33-j per cent would be intolerable but I do not take this to mean that anything lessthan this should not attx&apos;act de-rating.    When the then Minister of housing spoke at Rhyl on 18th February, 1961, he said;-&quot;Secondly, we are taking power to apply a measureof de-rating to householders, so as to protect them against the nasty jolt they would otherwise have on their rates if we left the existing law to run on unchanged.    I cannot tell yet what thepercentage of de-rating v/ill be, because wecannot say what v/ill be necessary until we seethe preliminary figures of the new valuation?and those figures cannot be ready before nextyear.    I hope we may be able to apply the sameuniform percentage of de-rating to all houseseverywhere.&quot;But the figures may show that it would be fairerto fix different percentages in different countiesor county boroughs, and we are taking power todo that if need be.    We certainly intend to seethat it is fair to everybody. &quot;2
We made great use of this quotation subsequently in pamphletsand in a special leaflet.     I am certain we will be expected to moveaccordingly in a small number of places and I feel that it would be wise to operate Section (2) of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1961,accordingly.    This would entail an order being laid before theHouse.I.M.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, S.
