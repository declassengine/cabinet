C. (62) 259th February, 1962CABINETLIGHT CARGO aircraft memorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Minister of aviation at a meeting of the Defence Committee on 19th December, 1961, we were invited to prepare a joint memorandum on the choice of light cargo aircraft to meet a military requirement, so that the Cabinet could make the final decision. At thattime, the choice appeared to be between the Herald and the Caribou. Since thenanother competitor has appeared, and made possible an agreed solution to theproblem.The Military Requirement2. New light cargo aircraft are required to provide support in war for forces operating in the field. The aircraft are also needed in peacetime to replace theValetta for general use.3. In the long term aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing arerequired for this purpose, but for the next 10 years or so the Rotodyne will be theonly available aircraft which could lift heavy loads vertically. The question of amilitary order for the Rotodyne is being considered separately, but whatever the outcome a large part of the requirement must be met by fixed wing aircraft capableof taking off and landing in a short distance (STOL).The Choice of STOL Aircraft4.   The choice now rests between three aircraft:(a) The Caribou, manufactured by the De Havilland Company of Canada,a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group.(b) A modified version of the &quot;Hand ley Page Herald.(c) a modified version of the Hawker Siddeley Group\s Avro 748, known asthe Avro 748/MF. (The Group had previously.submitted other designswhich were ruled out as too expensive and too late in delivery.)5. The following table compares the estimated delivery dates and initial costof the three aircraft. The estimates are derived from quotations by Che firms-basedon a fairly well-defined military requirement. The prices eventually paid would ofcourse be determined by contract negotiations.Full clearance Order completed	for service use	Number	(months from	Cost per	Total cost	(months from	required	date of	aircraft	of fleet	date,of		, contract)			contract)			 	  millionCaribou	15	48*	34	210*000-250,000	10-12Herald	33	31	39	360;000f	11-2Avro 748/MF	36	M	39	45,0iP00t	&apos;i 14Notes:* 5f-we decide to forgo the heavy vertical ;lift capacity which can be provided.only by the Rotodyne,an additional si 5 Caribous (costing s qme  -/ million) -would rbetregiiirpcUibirt $to (increase in the numberof Heralds or Ayro .748/MFs-syQuldbe-neGes^ary. **.&quot;..*:&apos;t i he cost estimates for the Herald and the Avro 748/MF are based on the use. pf the Dart 12engine; the.,cost,.of each would be reduced by  15,000- 20,600if: Dart 10&apos;engines were used. TheMinistry of Aviation would, however, recommend the use of Dart 12 engines in iboth cases.Copy No.5H60395Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1962
Operational and Financial Comparison6. The only military advantage of the Caribou is that it could be in serviceearlier than the others. While capable of meeting the limited war requirement, its performance is inferior to that of the Herald and the Avro, and, if the Rotodyne isnot bought, a Caribou force would cost more than either of the others.7. The Herald and the Avro, though later in service, would both be superiorin performance to the Caribou. Of the two British types, the Herald would bemarginally superior in performance to the Avro in some respects in which theaircraft differ (see Annexes A and B), but there is no decisive difference inperformance between the two aircraft. The Herald, by virtue of its high wing, islikely to be better suited to the tactical operation for which it is needed. On theother hand, the Air Registration Board have so far declined to declare the Heralda &quot; fail safe &quot; structure, though testing is continuing. Tests carried out so faron the Avro 748 indicate, in the opinion of the Ministry of Aviation, that the 748structure is superior and that the aircraft will demonstrate satisfactory fail safecharacteristics. This should mean that it will be cheaper to maintain. The presentforecast delivery dates for both aircraft are about the same.8. On the estimates given in paragraph 5 above, the initial cost to the defence budget of an x\vro force would be  2 - 8 million more than that of a Herald force,but it is expected that the cost of the Avro 748IMF will be reduced by  20,000per aircraft (a total of  620,000). This would make an Avro force  2-2 million more expensive than a Herald force. There are a number of other factors that could substantially affect the cost to the defence budget of choosing one aircraftrather than the other. It is not possible to quantify any of these factors, but in total they would tend to reduce the difference in cost of choosing the Avro ratherthan the Herald, and might even result in the Avro being the less expensive choice.Political and Industrial Factors Affecting the Choice9. There are the following objections to the choice of the Handley PageHerald:(a) The aircraft industry must be successfully rationalised if it is to becomeviable, and be capable of meeting future defence needs, as well ascontributing towards exports and the technological advance of theengineering industries.(b) To encourage reorganisation assurances were given and made public that future Government orders would be concentrated upon the maingroups in the industry, except where specialised requirements or public policy made it necessary to do otherwise. In this context, the aircraft industry was given to understand that &quot; specialised requirements &quot;meant equipment (whether electronic or aeronautical) and lightaeroplanes, and that &quot; public policy &quot; related only to placing orders inNorthern Ireland and to questions of interdependence.(c) On this basis, the reorganisation into five major groups took place at considerable expense to some companies, particularly the hawker siddeley Group. To give this large new order to a firm outside themain groups would be a violation of our pledges, and a contradictionof Government policy.(d) The effect of such action would be particularly serious in view of thepresent uncertainty about new projects to be placed with the majorgroups. A serious decline on the design side is already starting in thetwo airframe groups. Hawker Siddeley&apos;s situation in the absence offurther orders would soon become critical.(e) Since the placing of the order for the TSR-2 with the British aircraft corporation no substantial new requirement for military aircraft (apartfrom the five VC-lOs, also with the British Aircraft Corporation) hasbeen authorised, and in present financial circumstances there is great reluctance on the part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to approve the starting of new projects. This makes it all the more important thatGovernment purchases should be made in accordance with the pledges.
(/) It is necessary to consider possible repercussions in India. The Indianswere persuaded to adopt a British aircraft to replace their militaryDakotas, largely on the strength of an assurance by the, Prime Ministerto the Prime Minister of India that the British aircraft of their choice(they subsequently chose the Avro 748) would also be purchased by her Majesty&apos;s Government for regular service by a United Kingdomoperator. In the autumn of 1959, Her Majesty&apos;s Government were onthe point of concluding negotiations for the purchase of three Avro748s for use by a subsidiary of the British Overseas Airways Corporation.This deal fell through at the last moment because Hawker Siddeleysrepudiated the terms previously agreed with the then Ministry of Supply(which were similar to the terms on which three Heralds had beenbought). Subsequently Aden Airways (a subsidiary of the british overseas Airways Corporation) placed an order for three Avro 748s. Itis possible that this order may not now mature. In any event, theMinister of Aviation would not regard this order as fulfilling the PrimeMinister^ undertaking to the Indians.10. If the Caribou were ordered the United Kingdom would not have the direct benefit of the design and production work, but the following advantageswould be obtained:(a) The Canadians have offered, if the Caribou is bought, to negotiate a barterdeal so as to match the value of our order with purchases which wouldnot otherwise have been made in this country so that no adverse dollarbalance would fall on the United Kingdom. These would include,inter alia :(i) The purchase of three Comets for the Royal Canadian Air Force(this order would be particularly welcome to Hawker Siddeleysince they have some unsold Comets on their hands).(ii) Reciprocal   purchases   of  this   kind   would  be   a   practicaldemonstration of the value of interdependence.(iii) There are at present several unresolved political issues between us and the Canadians, e.g., over the Common Market negotiations.The High Commissioner has advised that the proposed purchaseof Caribous would go far to convince the Canadians of our willingness to meet them half way, and would stand us in goodstead in our dealings with the Canadians on wider issues.11. The choice of either the Caribou or the Avro 748 would accord withour policy and considerably ease the position of the Hawker Siddeley Group. Itwould also mean that the project was entrusted to a major group with a long-termfuture in the industry. We would be assured, therefore, that the project would becarried through satisfactorily to its conclusion, and that any follow-on orders, orfurther developments would be satisfactorily handled. There could be no suchassurance regarding the Herald. Equally the future support of the Victorprogramme depends on Handley Page being taken over by one of the majorgroups and this would not be assisted by a Herald order.Recommendation12. For the reasons given in paragraph 8 we consider that the financial considerations are not decisive. In view of the Governments declared policy towards the aviation industry we therefore recommend that the Avro 748 /MFshould be ordered. The Ministry of Aviation in their negotiations with the firmwill naturally take all possible steps to ensure that the most favourable terms are obtained.H. W.P. T.9th February, 1962.
