confidnetial cabinet OFFICEcB(54) 120 RECORD COPY copy no. fcfr30th march, 1954cabinet&quot;operation round-up&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland&quot;I do indeed come from Scotland, butI cannot help it&quot;   (Boswell)I have studied with much, interest the Minister of Housing and local governments comprehensive scheme for Local Government (C0 (54) 111).It deals, of course, with local government in England and Wales; and itmay be useful if I refer briefly to the position in Scotland.Structure of Local Government2d        There is no widespread demand in Scotland for any fundamental change in the structure of local government: and I agree with the minister that we should not make one.    Indeed I would not at present propose toattempt any changes in Scotland of the kind suggested in paragraph 9 ofthe first appendix to the Minister&apos;s memorandum.    It may be that, in theory, some of our authorities are too small for their present category:but we should run into tremendous opposition for very little practical result if we tried to abolish them or reduce their status.    As to conurbations, wehave really only one - in the Clyde Valley.    We may have to do somethingabout it one-day: but its local government is working reasonably well andI see no advantage in revising it now at all commensurate with the troubleand unpopularity which revision would cause.    As regards county districts,the Scottish district councils have only insignificant functions, and it maybe argued that they should either be abolished or given - at the expense ofthe county councils - something worth while to do.    Either alternative would cause endless argument: and, as the present state of affairs isdoing no great harm, I propose to leave it alone.Finance3.       Any decision about de-rating must obviously apply to Scotland aswell as to England and Wales.    If the decision were mine, I would do nothingtill we see the effect on rates of the new valuations in England and Wales and make up our minds about the future system of valuation and rating inScotland, into which an enquiry by the Sorn Committee is proceeding.    TheScottish local authorities, however, like the English, would gladly see theend of de-rating: and, of course, its abolition would help to reduce theincrease in the poundage of rates which we may have to face in Scotland if,as a result of the Sorn enquiry, we decide to adopt the English system ofrating and valuation.
40        But, if anything is to be done, I am very unhappy about the suggestion of abolishing industrial de-rating by itself,    I am sure the Scottish localauthorities would argue that if industrial de-rating goes, the agriculturalde-rating introduced by the 1929 Acts should go too, and it may be difficultto defend the withdrawal of the support of de-rating from the smaller and less profitable industries - of which the Scottish development areas and the highlands have more than their share - while continuing to give it to the farmer.    We cannot, in Scotland, argue that there are any technical difficulties in abolishing agricultural de-rating, because agriculturalsubjects are already entered in the Valuation Roll,50       As regards exchequer equalisation grant, we have alreadylegislated for Scotland; and I do not propose to do anything more till we see the result of the new valuations in England and Wales and decide whatto do about the Scottish valuation and rating system,60       As regards housing, I expect that most, if not all, of the small number of properties still held on requisition will be released to theirowners this year and the families in them rehoused.    Like the Minister,I am anxious to encourage the building of more houses for owner-occupationbut I am not sanguine of any immediate results in Scotland where thepresent output of privately-built houses is only 2,500 a year,    I am clear,therefore, that in Scotland the bulk of new building must continue to be doneby local authorities; and in view of the acute housing shortage that still remains to be met before homeless families can be provided for, I shallbe obliged to ask that the housing subsidies should meantime be continued at their present level for all houses built by local authorities.Time-tableJ 1 o70        The Minister proposes to lay a White Paper in October and to legislate next session with a view to bringing his proposals as a whole intoforce on 1st April, 195 60    There would clearly have to be a separate white paper for Scotland, from which the proposals about local governmentreform, equalisation grant and the revision of the general needs subsidy would, I suggest, be omitted.    I should probably, however, have to deal init with the report of the Sorn Committee on Scottish Rating and Valuationwhich I expect to receive in August.    If the report is delayed, or if its recommendations present us with serious difficulty, it may not therefore be easy for me to keep to the Minister&apos;s time-table.    And if the recommenda-tions of the Sorn Committee are what we expect them to be, legislation tocarry them out will be of the most difficult and controversial kind,    Never-theless, I think it would clearly be desirable, if we are to do anything next session about de-rating, to enact the Scottish rating and valuation changesnext session also.8,       I ought to add, however, that we expect the Sorn Committee, inaddition to proposing the abolition of owners1 rates,to recommend a completerevaluation of property on English lines.    This, as I have already^r indicated,might mean a rise in the poundage of rates,,    It would therefore have beenexpedient to make the introduction of the new valuations coincide with theabolition of de-rating; but new valuation rolls could not possibly be in force by 1956.    Accordingly, legislation next session abolishing de-rating andenacting the Sorn Committee^ recommendations would have to table  effect in two stages - the first, on 16th May, 1956 and the second perhaps two yearslater.    At the first stage the poundage of rates would go down; at thesecond it might go up.    It would have been better from my point of view to defer the whole thing till 1958: but of course de-rating must end, if it is tobe abolished, at the same time in both countries.
Procedure9.        The Minister suggests that his proposals should be studied inprinciple by a Committee of Ministers and examined in their technicalaspects by a Committee of officials.    I agree with this suggestion and Ithink it would be useful, in view of the differences in the Scottish situation to which I have referred, for the Scottish Office to be represented on bothof these bodies.J.S.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.29TH MARCH, 1954.
