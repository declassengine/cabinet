Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1954SECRETCopy No.C. (54) 14312th April, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETBUTTER supplies memorandum by the Minister of FoodButter rationing is to end on 8th May. I am circulating this note on prospectivesupplies and prices for information so that my colleagues may be aware of theposition on decontrol.2. Ministry stocks on 1st May will amount to about 36,000 tons. By nextSeptember we will get from Australia, New Zealand and Denmark some 91,000tons under current contracts which, as a result of the drought in New Zealand,is 20,000 tons less than I had expected. Home production should give us 8,000tons in this period, and the trade, who will be free to import on private accountfrom 9th May, may acquire another 30,000 tons, though at higher prices than theMinistry has been paying.3. Even on the assumption that all these supplies will be forthcoming, weshall not be able to guarantee that 4 ozs. per head per week will be available until next December when the new season&apos;s supplies from the Southern Dominions willbe coming forward. 4 ozs. is the present ration, which is being fully taken up atthe controlled price of 3s. Sd. per lb.4. I have stated publicly on more than one occasion that de-rationing wouldnot mean that all demands for butter would be met at present prices. In fact,supplies now available in the world could not meet this country&apos;s pre-war levelof demand when butter was, of course, relatively much cheaper than today. Butwe cannot maintain the necessarily elaborate rationing machinery for this onecommodity.5. In these circumstances, the price of butter on decontrol might rise to between 4s. and 4s. 6d. per lb. I cannot check this by additional releases fromMinistry stocks, as to do so might make the position worse in the autumn beforethe new season&apos;s supplies come in from Australia and New Zealand. I am hopeful that competition from high quality branded margarine at Is. 9d. per lb., well-advertised and of a quality which the consumer has not hitherto enjoyed, will actas a useful brake on any tendency for prices to rise above the 4s.-4s. 6d. level.6. Under these conditions, I shall sell the weekly quantities which we dis-tribute from our stocks at the best market price. Any attempt to hold retail pricesdown by releasing our stocks at below market level would only provide the dis-distributors with a gratuitous profit or stimulate demand artificially and so encourage a shortage later on. The trade will, of course, be encouraged by a higher price to seek out additional quantities overseas. But world butter prices are rising andthere is a distinct possibility that Russia will be in the market for substantial quantities again this year.G. LL.-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,10th April, 1954.46034
