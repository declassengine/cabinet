1 m &apos;3o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT:CONFIDENTIAL,c.(54) 126 CABiNbT OFFICE        copy no.RECORD COPY5th April, 1954 &apos;CABINETCONSULTATION WITH THE COAL INDUSTRY ON THEUNITED KINGDOMS ASSOCIATION WITH THE european coal AND STEEL community memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power at their meeting on 21st January, 1954 (C. C. (54) 4th Conclusions,Minute 2), the Cabinet authorised me to consult the coal interests on thebasis that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to place the UnitedKingdom&apos;s association with the European Coal and Steel Community on a contractual footing.2.        I have obtained the views of the National Coal Board, but I thoughtit desirable at this stage to avoid formal consultation with the miners.Instead, the National Coal Board have taken informal soundings of leadingofficials of the National Union of Mineworkers (N.U.M.).    The formal viewsof the Board, including a reference to a private discussion with leadingofficials of the N. U. VI. , are set out in the Annex to this memorandum.3.        The Board emphasise that they would still strongly prefer that relations with the Community be left to develop freely out of commercial negotiations and discussions from time to time, leading to particular agree-ments on particular aspects of the international coal trade.    The Boardrecognise, however, that there are wider, i. e. political, considerations which might cause Her Majesty&apos;s Government to favour a contractualassociation with the Community.4.        Subject to this reservation, the Board1 s views follow fairly closely the recommendations of the Working Party of officials set out in Annex 3of C. (54) 20.    Thus, the Board consider that a contractual associationmight include agreement on supplies of coal to the Community both in normal times and in conditions of surplus or shortage;  an understandingon prices and dumping; and provision for consultation on investment plans, etc.    The Board would wish to be represented on any Council of association that might be set up.    They would also expect &quot;to participatefully in any negotiations with the High Authority from the start&quot;.5.        The Board are opposed to the free entry of Community coal intothe United Kingdom.    In their view, this would be likely to createmisunderstanding and difficulty with the miners.    How strongly the minerswould feel could not be ascertained without formally consulting them.But in fact the competitiveness of the United Kingdom coal industrycompared with that of Community countries, coupled with the obviousadvantage of geography, makes it unlikely that coal  could profitably be imported at the present time into the United Kingdom from Europe on any significant scale.    Recognising this, the High Authority might well beprepared not to insist on the right of unrestricted coal imports into theUnited Kingdom.    They might, however, regard this as a point of fundamental principle.
m6.        The members of the N. U. M. , who were consulted in their personal capacity by the National Coal Board, are broadly in agreement with theviews expressed by the Board.    In my opinion we need not and should not carry consultation with the miners any further at this stage.    A more convenient time to invite the formal views of the N. U. M. would be afterany exploratory talks with M. Monnet have been held.7.        It is not necessary now to consider what weight should be given tothe various points covered in the Board&apos;s memorandum.    In general theBoard&apos;s proposals seem to provide a helpful and reasonable basis forexploratory talks with M. Monnet.    After such talks we should be better able to judge the relative importance attached by the High Authority to thevarious matters at issue, and until the stage of negotiation is reached we need not decide where to stand firm and where to make concessions.8.       If there are to be exploratory talks with M. Monnet and negotiationsthereafter, it is, in my view, essential that the National Coal Board shouldbe directly and closely.associated with them.    The Board should thereforebe represented on whatever group we appoint to speak for the UnitedKingdom.9.        I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that, if the Governmentdecide to proceed further in this matter -(i)     the National Coal Board proposals be taken as a basis forexploratory talks on coal with M. Monnet; and(ii)     the Board be invited to take part in those talks and in any negotiations that may result from them.G.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1.3rd April, 1954.
annex memorandum BY THE NATIONAL. COAL BOARDON ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THEEUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITYIntroductoryThe National Coal Board still strongly prefer (as they indicated intheir memorandum of 30th October,   1953) that relationships with theCommunity should be left to develop freely out of commercial negotiations and discussions from time to time.    These might lead to particular agree-ments on particular aspects of the international coal trade.2,        It is understood from Sir Laurence Watkinson&apos;s memorandum of27th January, 1954 that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are now &quot;disposed to favour a contractual association with the European Coal and Steel Community1&apos;which would involve no surrender of sovereignty and no conflict with existing international obligations.    This means, we take it, that the United Kingdomcoal industry would not become subject to the jurisdiction of the high authority, but that a limited association between equal partners would beset up on the basis of certain partnership rules.    In the absence of agree-ment between the partners on certain important matters outside the agreedrules, each would be free in the last resort to go its own way.3.       Although still maintaining their strong preference for the coursereferred to in paragraph 1, the Board have considered afresh in the light ofthese important new considerations the interested of the United Kingdom coalindustry which should be safeguarded in the kind of association now envisaged.Supplie s4.        The common market is an outlet, both now and in the future, forBritish coaLi     (In 1953 the Community took about 5 million tons or36. 5 per cent of our total exports.    In the medium term it might be a market for some 7/10 million tons or up to 50 per cent of our total exports.)Terms of Association should therefore ensure that the United Kingdom isregarded as a normal source of supply for the Community, not as aresidual supplier to be turned to in times of shortage and ignored in times of surplus.    In &quot;normal times&quot; (i. e. in the absence of declared shortageor surplus) the United Kingdom should have free access to the common market on agreed terms without the intervention of Community Govern-ments.    In periods of shortage or surplus, the quantities and qualities tobe provided would be matters for prior negotiations;  in times of shortagethe needs of the United Kingdom home market and other export destinationswould have to be safeguarded;  in times of &quot;manifest crisis&quot; the Community(in return for prior negotiations about quantities in times of shortage) wouldbe expected to take reasonable quantities of coal.    The United kingdom should not be expected to conform in the home market with, any productionquotas which might be established for producers in the Community.5,        Cn the other hand, for the kind of reasons given in the Board1 smemorandum of 30th October, 1953, the Board could not agree that a contractual association should provide for the free entry of Communitycoal to the United Kingdom home market.    Even to concede this inprinciple (and on a reasonably confident expectation that free imports onany significant scale are probably remote) would be likely to create mis-understanding and difficulty with the mineworkers.    Nevertheless there
might be times in the future when, as at present, mutually advantageousexchanges of coals could be arranged between the Community and the Board,The initiative towards arranging these exchanges could rest with either party, a point which could, and should, be made clear in the course of negotiations about association.Dumping6.        The agreement of association should include an undertaking, on both sides, not to dump in each other &apos;s markets, even in third markets.It would be difficult to define &quot;dumping&quot; satisfactorily and regard would nodoubt have to be paid to existing international obligations.Prices7.       It has been suggested that we might agree to quote the same price to all consumers for similar coals within the common market.    This wecould accept as a general rule so long as we were given freedom to adjustour prices to meet differing competitive conditions in various parts of thecommon market, so that we should in practice be undertaking to offer thecoal we wished to sell (within any agreement reached on quantity and quality) to the common market and its different parts at prices competitivewith those of other producers.    We might even be prepared to conform withany maximum or minimum prices that the High Authority might fix, so longas we were given full opportunity to discuss in advance the application ofsuch prices to British coal entering the common market.We could not, however, accept an obligation to publish our prices .in the common market.    This would mean publishing our export prices:whereas the obligation of Community producers to publish prices meanspublication of their prices in the enlarged home, but common, market andtraditionally the Community countries have all published their home prices.Production Planning8.        The High Authority&apos;s intervention in production planning within theCommunity seems likely, in the light of recent developments, to be confinedlargely to the definition periodically of general objectives, within the frame-work of which the High Authority will be able to make advances to their ownenterprises in certain cases.    The United Kingdom coal industry is hardlylikely to need loans from the High Authority but disclosure of generalindications of our capital development programmes and of progress towards their fulfilment would enable the High Authority to take this into account in preparing their own objectives and thus be a means of keeping open apart of the common market for our coal in the longer term.    It should bepossible to agree with the High Authority that we were not obliged to disclose details of individual projects, which we should be unwilling to do.Wages and Social Questions9.       M. monnet  sole reference in his note of 24th December, 1953 towages and social questions is that &quot;the High Authority and the Governmentof the United Kingdom should undertake a continuing examination of .... .the living conditions of the labour force&quot; but Sir Laurence Watkinson&apos;note of 27th January speaks of &quot;consultation on wages and movement oflabour&quot; based on Articles 68 and 69 of the Schuman Treaty,    M. Monnefsphrase is almost all-embracing, certainly it seems likely to cover muchmore than the housing of workers:  consultation about wages and movement
of labour against the background of those Articles would raise difficult anddelicate questions of great importance in our relations with the mineworkers,,For these reasons we consider that extreme caution is needed in considering how far a contractual relationship should cover this kind of question.    Wewould prefer therefore to await further clarification of M. monnet  ideasbefore giving a final judgment.    We appreciate that it is possible toindulge in &quot;continuing examination&quot; for an unlimited time and without any obligation to reach conclusions, but it would be unwise to assume thatM. Monnet would be content with permanent frustration of the subjects which he has suggested should be dealt with by this method.Research10.       M. monnet  note of 24th December does not mention research:Sir Laurence Watkinson&apos;s note of 27th January suggests that associationmight include exchange of information on research.    We think that a&quot;formal&quot; obligation to exchange information on research could very well lead to an undesirable degree of control over our general researchactivities so as to ensure that they fitted the work being done in theCommunity countries.    We therefore feel strongly that it would not be prudent to agree to do more in the way of exchange of information andco-operation than we are doing now by participating in some of the high authority&apos;s conferences and by individual contacts with the member countries.Transport11.        Care would be needed in framing any reciprocal undertaking fromthe Community in return for any undertaking which Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment might be prepared to give that there would be no discrimination in fixing the United kingdom s transport charges by reference to the originor destination of coal and steel.    That reciprocal undertaking ought interms to forbid the application of exceptional transport charges in favourof Community coal coming into competition with United Kingdom coal.Council of Association12.       M, monnet  proposals envisage the establishment of a Council of association to oversee the working of the Treaty of Association.    TheBoard.feel, for obvious reasons, that they should be represented on this body.M. monnet  note also suggests that it would be appropriate toconsider how to settle differences of interpretation of the &quot;agreed rules&quot; ordisputes about the way in which the parties had given effect to &quot;concertedactions&quot;.    We would agree that this question needs consideration, but would hope that simpler arrangements could be devised than the establish-ment of an arbitration tribunal or similar body to which differences ordisputes would have to be referred.Public Discussion13.       M. Monnet also points out that the High Authority considers itdesirable &quot;that the actions of the Council of Association should be thesubject of public discussion in a form to be decided&quot;.We see considerable difficulty from a commercial viewpoint inany system which might require our policies and activities in regard toour export trade to be discussed in public.    Equally we doubt whether it
Jowould be appropriate to concede to the Community and its various organsgreater or wider opportunities for public discussion of the 3oard&apos;s affairsthan are normally available to Parliament in the United Kingdom,General14.      Finally we consider that the Board should be asked to participatefully in any negotiations about Association with the High Authority from the start.View of the National Union of Mineworkers15.      We have disclosed the memorandum of 27th January to, and discussed the foregoing statement of the 3oard&apos;s views with, the leadingofficials of the National Union of Mineworkers, stressing the confidentialnature of the documents.    They have made it clear that they are not in aposition, in so important a matter, to commit their members without takingit at least to their National Executive and possibly beyond that.    they realise that this cannot be done, and therefore they consider that we should merely record that they have been consulted, that on balance their members would probably prefer to avoid a contractual relationship between theUnited Kingdom and the Community.    If Her Majesty&apos;s Government should decide that there is to be such a relationship, they consider in their personal capacity that the Board have drawn attention adequately to the matters whichshould be safeguarded.Hobart House, S, W. 1,11th March, 1954.
