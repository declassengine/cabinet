ISCSECRETCABINET OFFiCE / ,c-(54) 142 RECORD COPY     copy NO* -M14th April, 1954CABINET:ONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN SINGAPOREMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the ColoniesLast October the Governor of Singapore appointed a Commission to review the constitution of the Colony.    Its report was published in february and has been well received by the Press both here and in Singapore.    TheAppendix to this paper sets out the present position in Singapore and themain changes which I have now decided to recommend after consultationwith the Governor.2.        There are only two points with which I need trouble my colleaguesbecause they may give rise to some controversy.3.        First, I am sure that, except for some persons born in the Federa-tion of Malaya and the territories of British Borneo and resident in singapore, the franchise should be open only to British subjects who arecitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and not, as now, to all Britishsubjects.    I agree with the Commission and the Governor that there shouldbe no concession on the fundamental principle that the voteis open only toBritish subjects, although this will continue to debar from voting asubstantial majority of the Chinese in Singapore, who are technically aliens.In the long&apos;run this problem will settle itself as new generations of Chinesegrow up who, having been born in Singapore, are not only British subjectsbut also enjoy citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.    meanwhile it is open to most of the &quot;alien&quot; Chinese in Singapore to acquire thatcitizenship by naturalization;  and I ana anxious rather to stimulate them todo so than to lessen the disadvantages to them of not doing so.    But mydecision will in addition deny the vote to nationals of commonwealth countries who are not also citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.Only the Governments of India and Ceylon are likely to protest and only the indians are deeply affected.    The numbers of other Commonwealth nationals in Singapore are small.    The Indian community in Singapore is much themost active politically and plays a part in politics out of all proportion toits numbers.    At the same time, most Indians are at present unwilling toaccept in full the obligations of citizenship, including liability to militaryservice, which they are able to avoid because they are not citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies.    I am advised that there is a good deal oflocal feeling about this and I am satisfied that only those who are preparedfully to identify themselves with the Colony and to accept all the obligations of citizenship should be granted the franchise.    No obstacle will be putin the way of Indians who desire to register as citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies;  indeed, I hope that this change will encourage themto do so.    The Government of India will have no solid ground for complaintsince they do not accord reciprocal rights to citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies from Singapore.    Moreover, they have publicly encouragedIndians permanently resident in other Commonwealth territories to identifythemselves as closely as possible with those territories.
274.        Second, I have decided to abolish the existing provision for specialrepresentation in the Legislature of the Chinese, European and IndianChambers of Commerce.    In my view the time for this is past;  and ifsuch a concession continued in favour of the Chambers of Commerce itwould be virtually impossible not to extend it to other sectional interestssuch as the trade unions.    Above all, however, I am impressed by theGovernor&apos;s advice that, so long as the Chinese can secure representationby special provisions of this kind, they will remain averse to enteringfully into the ordinary political life of the Colony - and it is essentialthat they should do so if constitutional development in Singapore is to bestable and orderly.    Having been led to the water, the reluctant dragonmust be persuaded to drink.O.L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.13th April, 195/.-.APPENDIXGeneral Character of Proposed changes the new constitution will involve the virtual transfer of power fromthe Governor to elected Ministers in a Council of Ministers responsible to a legislative Assembly with a large elected majority.At present the Governor exercises his executive authority through his officials.    His Executive Council is an advisory body whose advice heneed not take.    Only the official members of the Executive Council have any executive powers and the unofficial members of it are equal in number to them.    The Governor makes laws with the advice of a Legislative council which is composed of 9 official and 16 unofficial members (12 elected and4 nominated).Under the new constitution this Council of Ministers will consistof 6 elected and 3 ex officio Ministers.    Ministers will have full executive authority over their respective Departments.    Subject only to theGovernor^ reserve powers, which are to remain undiminished, the council will control all Government policy except that concerning defence, external affairs and internal security; and the three ex officio Ministers will berequired to conform to the majority decisions of the Council.    The council will be responsible to a Legislative Assembly in which there will be25 elected members out of a total of 32 (excluding the Speaker),Details of the Present and Proposed ConstitutionsPRESENT constitution the FranchiseA voter must be:-(a)   21 years old;-Z

The unofficial and elected members have no executive authority..The GovernorThe Governor exercises his authority through his officials inconsultation with the Executive Council.    His reserved powers enable himto refuse assent to any Bill and to declare a Bill or motion which theLegislative Council fails to pass to have effect if he thinks it reasonableor expedient to do so in the interest of public order and good government.NEW constitution the FranchiseA voter must be:-(a) 21 years old; and(b) a citizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniespr a person born in the Federation of malaya, Sarawak/North Borneo or Brunei.
(c)    be of unsound mind.The two important changes in these qualifications to exercise the vote arethe restriction of the vote to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies,whereas before all British subjects were qualified, and the deletion of thelocal residential requirement, although administrative steps will be takento ensure that no one will be placed on the electoral roll until he has beensix months in the Colony.It will no longer be necessary for persons qualified to exercise the vote themselves to take action to get their names on the electoral roll.The present identity card system will be used automatically to compile a register of persons entitled to vote.Legislative AssemblyChairman - a Speaker3 ex officio members  nominated unofficial members25 elected membersCouncil of MinistersChairman *- Governor3 ex officio members6 elected members the Council of Ministers will be regarded as a Cabinet and will include a chief Minister appointed by the Governor.    He will be the leader of theparty or coalition of parties commanding a majority in the LegislativeAssembly.    Subject to the Governor&apos;s reserve powers, the Council willcontrol government policy in all fields except defence, external affairs and internal security.    The ex officio Ministers will be required tosupport any policy agreed upon by a majority of the Council.The GovernorThe Governor&apos;s reserve powers will remain unimpaired, although they would only be used in extreme cases where in his opinion good govern-ment, public faith or public order appeared to be in danger.&apos;  I . -4- m(a) hold a foreign passport;(b) have committed certain offences;  or
