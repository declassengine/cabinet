BRITISH HONDURASMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies in accordance with the Cabinefs decision (C. C. (54) 9th conclusions minute 9) I arranged for an enquiry to be held into allegations of links between the People&apos;s United Party (P.U.P.) and the Government of GuatemalaSir Reginald Sharpe, Q. C. , carried out the enquiry and announced his find-ings (Annex A) on 29th March.2.        Though the findings are not sensational, the Commissioner is satisfied that certain specified persons, who are leaders of the P. U. P. ,have on various occasions sought, and on one occasion received, small-scalefinancial assistance from the Guatemalan Government, and that theycommunicated with that Government on Party policy.3.        The Attorney-General of 3ritish Honduras has decided not to institute criminal proceedings against the persons named.    I do not considerthat it would be wise to proscribe the P. Uffl P. as a Party.    It remains tobe seen how far, if at all, the findings will affect the result of the elections for the new Legislative Assembly, now fixed for 28th April.    The riskremains that the P. U0 P. , with its effective machine, may still win eightout of nine seatscThe New Constitution4.        The plans for the new constitution provide for adult suffrage, a legislative Assembly with an elected majority and an Executive Council,designated as the instrument of policy, consisting of three official members and six members elected by the Legislative Assembly, four of them from among the elected members of the Assembly.    (The present ExecutiveCouncil consists of three official members and four nominated unofficial members.)5.        Local legislation has been passed providing for adult suffrage andthe new Legislative Assembly, and all the arrangements have been madefor the elections to be held on 28th April.    The Executive Council isconstituted by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, and it is not necessary to issue these at once.Re commendation6. In November, 1953 the Cabinet decided on my recommendation thatthe introduction of the new constitution should not be deferred on account ofevents in British Guiana.    The public confirmation now provided of relationsotp f R TT cabinet office.(54) 130 o:-C0RD COPY copy no. i 76th April, 1954CABINET
between the leaders of the P. U. P. and the Government of a country that islaying claim to the Colony, when considered against the background of the comparatively undeveloped state of the Colony and its small population,carried serious implications for the future.    It seems clear that we shouldnot disfranchise the people of British Honduras on the strength of theCommission^ findings and it may be that they will return a sufficient number of P.U,?, candidates at the elections to give the Party all thefour seats which would be available for elected members on the ExecutiveCouncil if the Council is reconstituted as proposed.    There are obviousdangers in admitting to the policy-making body in the Colony members ofa Party which, it has been established, is involved with the GuatemalanGovernment.    But, perhaps more important, their presence on theExecutive Council is likely to make the Administration unworkable and reduce the whole constitutional process to a farce.    We must expect themto oppose all measures supported by the Governor and the three official members of the Executive Council.    We cannot hope that they would not be supported on occasion by one or both of the nominated unofficial membersof the Council.    The decisions of the Executive Council would at best betaken on a bare majority against the opposition of representatives of themajority Party in the Assembly, and such of the decisions as requiredendorsement by the Assembly in one way or another wotild be rejected,involving the use of the Governor&apos;s reserved powers in the day-to-day administration of the Colony.7.        In my view, the right course is to state that the elections will proceed as planned, and that when the results are known Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will have to consider, in consultation with the Governor,whether the administration of the Colony can be carried on with the newLegislative Assembly in a manner consistent with Her Majestyrs Govern-menfs responsibilities and without the day-to-day exercise of theGovernor&apos;s reserved powers.8.        What I have in mind is that if the result of the elections makes itimpossible, for the reasons given above, to proceed with the re constitutionof the Executive Council it might be possible to carry on, at least for atime, with the present form of Executive Council.    But if this could onlybe done by the constant use of the Governor!s reserve powers I think thatit will be necessary to arrange for a Constitutional Commission to visit the Colony and consider what would be the most appropriate constitution for the Colony in all the circumstances after hearing evidence from allinterested parties.    But I should prefer not to say so at this stage.9,        I propose to make a statement as at Annex B in the House ofCommons on Wednesday, 7th April.00 L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.5th April, 1954.Z
FINDINGS OF SIR REGINALD SHARPS, Q.C.In my commission from the Governor I was directed to announcemy findings publicly at the Court House, Belize, after the conclusion of the taking of all the evidence at the Enquiry,and that is what I am now about todo.    That direction does not require me to read out the whole of my reportsI will only read two paragraphs from it.Paragraph 11.    The first thing for me now to do is state the allegation&quot;tions, which were brought to my notice by the Governor of British Honduras,of contacts between the People&apos;s United Party (P.U.P.) or its members onthe one hand and authorities, organisations or persons in Guatemala or their representatives in British Honduras on the other hand.    Thoseallegations were at no time formulated before me by the Attorney-general in any precise form, but I think that the following may be said to be a fairstatement of such allegations(l) That early in 1950 George Price , the Secretary of the P. U. P. , wassending to the Guatemalan Consul in Belize written copies of speeches madeby him (George Price) in Belize.(2)    That during the public holiday on 10th September, 1951 a truck took part in a procession through the streets of Belize, which truck wasdecorated with flags of the P. U. P. which had been sent to the said Partyfrom Guatemala.(3)    That in the latter part of October, 1951 George Price, the Secretaryof the P. U. P., was having or seeking to have secret meeting in Belize withthe Guatemalan Consul here.(4)    That in the autumn of 1951 George Price, the Secretary of theP. U. P., received from the Guatemalan Consul in Belize the sum of $500(a) to cover, or as a contribution towards the costs of, the defence ofLeigh Richardson and three others who, at or about that time, stood their trialin the Supreme Court of British Honduras for sedition, and/or (b) to pay thefine of $120 imposed upon Armando Diaz, another of the accused.(5)    That between 14th and 22nd September, 1951 Phillip Goldson, the assistant Secretary of the P. U. P., had an interview in Guatemala Citywith the President of Guatemala and a discussion with the GuatemalanForeign Minister on the subject of obtaining from Guatemala a supply of newsprint for the &quot;Belize Billboard&quot;.(6)    That on 28th November, 1951 there was broadcast from theGovernment Broadcasting Station in Guatemala City an anti-British speechor talk, the material for the same having been supplied to the said Broad-casting Station by the P. U. P.(7)    That on or about 20th October, 1952 leading officials and membersof the P. U. P. attended a social party given by the Guatemalan Consul inBelize.(8)    That on or about 7th December, 1952 the P. U. P, caused a document containing a statement of its policy to be secretly conveyed tothe Guatemalan Government;  and
(9)    That Leigh Richardson, the leader of the P. U0 P. , took theoccasion of a visit which he paid to Guatemala for domestic reasons inJanuary and February, 1953 to see the Foreign Minister of Guatemala -(a) in order to secure his help in implementing urgentlya promise previously made by the GuatemalanConsul in Belize that between five and six thousanddollars would be given to the P. U. P. for the news-paper which was its official voice;(b) in order to ask him not to change the Guatemalan Consulin Belize, whose recall the British Minister wasdemanding, unless the person replacing him was one who could be trusted by the P. U. P. ;  and(c) in order to obtain from him certain political informa-tion.Paragraph 41.    I will now summarise my findings on the allegation-tions hereinbefore appearing in paragraph 11 hereof.(l)     I am not satisfied upon the evidence before me that early in 1950George Price, the Secretary of the P. TJ. P. , was sending to the GuatemalanConsul in Belize written copies of speeches made by him (George Price)in Belize.(2)    I am not satisfied upon the evidence before me that the flags withwhich the P. U. P. truck was decorated in the procession on 10th September,1951 had been sent to the said Party from Guatemala.(3)    There is no evidence before me that in the latter part of October,1951 George Price, the Secretary of the P. U. P. , had any secret meeting in Belize with the Guatemalan Consul here and I am not satisfied upon theevidence before me that he was seeking to have any such meeting at or about that time.(4)    I am satisfied upon the evidence before me that in the autumn of1951 George Price, the Secretary of the P. U. P. , received from theGuatemalan Consul in Belize a sum of $500 in connection with the costs ofthe defence of Leigh Richardson and three others who at or about that timestood their trial in the Supreme Court of British Honduras for sedition.I am also satisfied that the $500 came from Guatemala but I am not in aposition to say from what source in that country it came, nor am I ableto say whether it was used exclusively in payment of costs or whether itwas used in part to pay the fine imposed upon the accused Armando Diaz.(5)    I am satisfied upon the evidence that between 14th and 22nd Sep-tember,l951 Phillip Goldson, the Assistant Secretary of the P. U. P. , hadan interview in Guatemala City with the President of Guatemala, whichinterview was something more than a momentary and formal handshaking,and that at or about the same time also in Guatemala City Phillip Goldsonhad a discussion with a Guatemalan Minister on the subject of obtainingfrom Guatemala a supply of newsprint for the &quot;Belize Billboard&quot;, whichnewspaper I find to be, without doubt, the official voice of the P. U. P. ,but I am not able to say whether it was in fact the Foreign Minister with whom Phillip Goldson had this discussion about newsprint.(6)    I am satisfied upon the evidence that on 28th November, 1951 the broadcast then made from the Government Broadcasting Station in GuatemalaCity was based upon material supplied to the said Broadcasting Station byor through the instrumentality of the P. U, P.
/ ^(7)    I am satisfied upon the evidence that on or about 20th October, 1952leading officials and members of the P. U, P. attended a social party givenby the Guatemalan Consul in Belize, but the evidence does not indicate thatthose persons attended the Consul&apos;s party in their capacity of officials or members of the P. U. P. but rather that they did so either as private individuals or, if not as private individuals, then as officials or membersof the General Workers Union.    A large number of guests were present,including the Public Relations Officer of the Government of british honduras.(8)    I am satisfied upon the evidence that on or about 7th December, 1952.George Price, the Secretary of the P. U. P. , caused documents A to besecretly conveyed to the Guatemalan Government.(9)    I am satisfied upon the evidence that in February, 1953Leigh Richardson, the leader of the P. U. P. , had interviews in Guatemalawith representatives of the Government of that country, but whether witha Minister or with an Official I cannot say, on the lines of the instructions given or recommendations made to him previously by George Price, theSecretary of the P. U.P. , as set forth in documents B and I am satisfiedthat the purpose of such interviews was substantially as set forth underthe three subheads (a), (b) and (c) of Head (9) in paragraph 11 hereof.Document A is the one dated 3rd December, 1952.    I shall now sign myreport and deliver it to the Governor later this afternoon.    I fully expect that he will make it available to the public as soon as it can be printed,but it runs to about 70 pages and will of necessity take a little time to print.Document B to which I have just referred is undoubtedly an importantdocument and I am making copies of it available at once as part of thispresent announcement.    I am much obliged to you, Mr. Attorney, and toyou too, Mr. Baldermos, for the assistance which you have both affordedme in the conduct of this Enquiry.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR THE colonies as the House will be aware, an Enquiry has been carried out inBritish Honduras by Sir Reginald Sharpe, Q. C. into allegations of contacts between the People&apos;s United Party in that Colony and the Government ofGuatemala.    Sir Reginald Sharpe&apos;s findings have been published.    Hefinds that certain specified persons, who are leaders of the P. U. Pe, have on various occasions sought, and on one occasion received, financialassistance from the Guatemalan Government, and that they communicated with that Government on Party policy.    I propose to publish his report as a White Paper.2.        The constitutional changes which have been planned for british honduras for some time fall into two stages, one affecting the LegislativeAssembly and the other the Executive Council,    The latter is the instrument of policy and under the new plan would be composed of theGovernor, 3 officials and 6 members (2 of whom would be nominated members) elected by the Legislative Assembly.3.        Elections on the basis of universal adult suffrage for theLegislative Assembly will take place on 28th April.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will then have to consider in consultation with the Governorwhether the administration of the Colony can be carried on in a mannerconsistent with Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ responsibilities and withoutthe day-to-day exercise of the Governor&apos;s reserved powers, with the newLegislative Assembly and with an Executive Council either in its present form or in the new form which has been proposed.
