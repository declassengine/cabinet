(54) 1288th April, 1954CABINETLEGISLATION   ON   HEALTH,   WELFARE  AND   SAFETY   IN   NON-INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT AND CLOSING HOURS OF SHOPSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn C. (54) 122 the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Agriculture seek from the Cabinet a pro-visional decision that legislation should be promoted in the next Session on health,welfare and safety in non-industrial employment and on closing hours of shops.This proposal has been considered by the Home Affairs Committee (HA. (54) 5thMeeting, Minute 1), who invited me to report upon it briefly to the Cabinet on their behalf.   I report accordingly.The Case for Legislation2. The Home Affairs Committee recognised the force of the arguments infavour of legislation on these matters. The two Reports of the Gowers Committee(Cmd. 7105 and 7664) were published as long ago as 1947 and 1949 and, with the express approval of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (52) 22nd Meeting,Minute 6 and H.A. (53) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1), their recommendations have beenmade the subject of prolonged consultation with all interests affected. It is hardlysurprising, therefore, that the Ministers concerned should find themselves underincreasing pressure, particularly from the Trades Union Congress, to act upon theGowers Committee&apos;s recommendations without further delay. There is, more-over, practical justification for such action for example, in the unsatisfactoryconditions of work which certainly obtain in many shops, offices and particularlyprovincial theatres, in the conditions prevailing in locomotive sheds on the railways,and in the high accident rate among agricultural workers compared with the corres-ponding rate in industries subject to the Factories Acts. There is also the furtherconsideration that it may be thought to be fitting that the legislative programme for what may be the last session of the present Parliament should contain a major item of social legislation of a kind in keeping with long-established Conservative tra-ditions in the industrial field. In any case, the purpose of legislation would be to lay down no more than standards of a basic kind, leaving their detailed applicationto be effected by statutory instruments as circumstances might permit.The Case Against legislation. The arguments on the other side, however, appeared to the Committee to possess little, if any, less force. It is certainly not unusual for action upon therecommendations of Royal Commissions or Committees of Enquiry to be con-siderably delayed. The Labour Party themselves, for example, were in office from1945 to 1951 without taking action upon the Report of the Royal Commission onSafety in Mines, which was submitted in 1938 and forms the basis of the Bill whichwe are ourselves now carrying through Parliament. The consultations with theinterests concerned,, moreover, have taken place on the clear understanding thatthey involved no commitment as to whether and, if so, when legislation would be practicable. On the merits of the case for legislation, whilst the Committee didnot doubt that there were unsatisfactory features in the present position, there was46003
some support for the view that the advantages to be gained by legislating might beoutweighed by the undesirability of imposing extensive fresh restrictions and obligations upon private employers, both great and small, including, in particular,the whole farming community, and of extending the field for intervention by Gov-ernment inspectors who would need to be increased in numbers for the purpose.Attention was particularly drawn to the catering trade, which is already subjectto so many restrictions that the future of the hotel industry in this country has beenput in jeopardy.4. Perhaps the most important aspect of the problem, however, concernsnext sessiorfs legislative programme generally. The Committee were informed by the Leader of the House that Government supporters in the Commons are becoming increasingly restive about the volume of legislation which the Govern-ment are trying to carry through on the basis of their present meagre majority and,as the present Parliament draws to its close, it may be considered prudent to relaxrather than intensify the Parliamentary pressure upon Government supporters. Itis understood that legislation to implement all the Gowers Committee&apos;s recom-mendations would be likely to amount to some 150 clauses of a complex andcontentious nature. If other potential claims on Parliamentary time appeared tobe limited, there might be no valid objection on Parliamentary grounds to under-taking so formidable a legislative task even at this stage in the life of the present parliament. In fact, Departments generally have indicated their desire to promote a wide variety of other measures and there are already other projects under con-sideration which would involve formidable legislation in the next session. Theview was expressed in the Committee that, if the Government should decideagainst proceeding with legislation on the Gowers Reports in the next session, thisdecision could be justified on the ground that the necessary Parliamentary time wasnot likely to be available.Extent of Possible legislation. A possible alternative course is that, even if it were decided to undertakelegislation on these matters in the next session, such legislation should not be framed to cover the whole field. It might, for example, concern only shops&quot;hours, on which the Gowers Committee reported first. Even if it were also toextend to health, welfare and safety, it might, nevertheless, be limited to only partof the field for example, the railways. In favour of such limitation it was pointedout that railways are more akin to industry generally than are offices, shops and agriculture, and that legislation in respect of them is likely to be less controversial.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that it might seem curious, to say the least,to single out for statutory regulation in this matter a single organisation theBritish Transport Commission which, through being nationalised, is subject to ministerial control and whose new Chairman can be relied upon in practice to goas far as. is reasonably practicable in carrying out the obligations of a goodemployer. The Government would also lay themselves open to the accusation thatin this matter they were intentionally discriminating against a nationalised industry as compared with private employers.conclusion. In short, the Home Affairs Committee&apos;s discussion on these matters wasinconclusive. Whilst there was substantial support for the Ministers&apos; proposals in principle, there was almost equal doubt about the desirability of legislating, atleast in respect of the whole field, in the 1954-55 Session. The Committeerecognised that the issues for decision were clearly of such importance that theycould only be finally decided by the Cabinet and that it might well be that, beforethe Cabinet reached final decisions upon them, they would desire to receive advice from a smaller body of senior Ministers who had had the opportunity to investigatethem in greater detail.m, , .     : -.; ...v S.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1954.
