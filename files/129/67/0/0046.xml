I ^ STHE ROYAL TOUR;  UGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesSince this question was discussed in the Cabinet on 7th April (C.C.(54) 26th Conclusions, Minute 1) I have received anothertelegram from the Governor of Uganda, a copy of which is attached as appendix I.    This telegram gives details of the changes suggested for thesecond day&apos;s programme.    I have submitted to Her Majesty the advice that her visit should take place as planned except for the modifications onthe second morning, and I have given details of the revised programmesuggested by the Governor.    I have since been informed that Her Majestyapproves the change of plan and the revised programme.2. I have set out at Appendix II a statement of the whole programme which Her Majesty will now undertake during her visit to Uganda,3. On the first day, 28th April, the Queen will not go outside thegrounds of Government House, except for the short drive from Entebbeairport and there should be no difficulty in guarding that road.4. During the early part of the morning of 29th the Queen willalso remain in the grounds of Government House.    At 11. 30 a. m. she willfly direct from Entebbe to Jinja and will drive from the airfield at Jinjato the barracks of the Xing&apos;s African Rifles.    From that time until sheleaves for the Owen Falls Dam on the outskirts of Jinja, she will remain within the barracks and immediately after the ceremony at the Darn is over,she will fly back to Entebbe.    The routes of the short journeys at Jinja willbe guarded by a battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles and substantialpolice forces.5. The whole of the third day, 30th April, will be spent in the queen Elizabeth National Park which lies in the extreme West of the protectorate between Lake Edward and Lake George.    The Park is welloutside Buganda and more than 300 miles from the nearest point of Kenya:it would be virtually impossible for a Mau Mau terrorist to make his waythere without being detected.    The Queen will be closely guarded in thePark.    On leaving the Park, the Queen will fly straight back to Entebbe,where she will remain at Government House until she leaves by air later in the evening of the same day.6, My colleagues will see from paragraph 3 of Appendix I that theGovernor of Uganda recognises that the dominating and over-ridingconsideration must be the Queen&apos;s safety but considers that, with the changein the programme now proposed, this will be met.    I feel that we can acceptthe advice of the Governor, who is in the best position to judge.Colonial Office, S0W.l.12th April, 1954.   &quot;O.L.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................T^LSff ET CABINET OFFICE Copy No..5.X.C^54) 146 .-   RECORD oOPY12th April, 1954CABINET
APPENDIX i telegram DATED 7TH APRIL, 1954FROM THE GOVERNOR OF UGANDAGovernor of Kenya1 s telegram No. 359.Queen&apos;s Visit.I have now discussed fully with my advisers whether it wouldbe practicable to amend programme on the lines suggested in paragraph of that telegram.    We are all agreed this could be done and I propose thatthe second day&apos;s programme should be arranged as follows: -(a) Between 9.30 and 11 a. m. Her Majesty should meet at Government House some of those whom she would have met during stops in the drive roundKampala i. e. , first Municipal Council, then a partyfrom Maker ere, and then Anglican Bishops andcertain other clergy.    A large party of Scouts,Guides and schoolchildren, who would have been present at the presentation of the colours inKampala, would also be invited to the government house garden during this period.(b) Party would fly to Jinja at 11. 30 a. m. and Coloursceremony would take place immediately on arrivalon K.A.R. parade grounds in their barracksfinishing about 12.40,    Her Majesty would then takelunch with the officers in their mess and would subsequently have a period of rest of over two hoursat Commanding Officer&apos;s house before the Owen Fallsceremony.    This would proceed precisely as planned and the party would fly back to Entebbe thereafter.The first and third day programme would be exactly as planned.2. Commanding Officer considers that complste security can beobtained at K.A.R. barracks, and for very short journeys between barracks,airport, and Dam at Jinja we shall have not only the whole of the 4th K.A.R.but substantially more police through the shortening of the route to betravelled by the Royal Party.3. In the light of the above, I urge that modification of programmesuggested above should be accepted and that visit should not (repeat not)be cancelled.    Dominating and over-riding consideration must of course bethe Queen&apos;s safety, but in the light of last sentence of paragraph 4 of Kenyatelegram No. 359, and of discussion which I have now had with my own advisers Iconsider this is met.    In the circumstances, I feel justified in pointing outthe unfortunate political consequences which would follow here from acancellation of the visit at this stage and in the present situation; a merechange in the programme, although it would give rise to difficulty referredto in Kenya telegram No. 359, would be much less serious.
4. I very much hope it will be possible to let me have a definite decision not later than 14th April.    If it should be possible to inform mebefore the Queen&apos;s final decision is taken what advice is submitted to her,that would give me a little more time.    Meanwhile, I am not having anyconcrete arrangements made for any modification of the programme,although a very small number of my Senior Officers are being informedsecretly of the possibility of a change so that action which would have to betaken should a change be decided upon can be planned.5. Governor of Kenya please pass copy to Commander-in-Chief.APPENDIX IIVisit to Uganda of Her Majesty The Queen andHis Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh28th to 30th April 1954The following is an outline of the revised programme for the visit to Uganda of Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal Highness, the duke of Edinburgh,28th AprilHer Majesty and His Royal Highness are due to arrive atEntebbe airport from Aden at 10 a. m.
