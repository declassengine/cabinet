Printed for the Cabinet, April 1954SECRETCABINET office record copy copy No. 6C. (54) 14713th April, 1954CABINETPOST OFFICE MANIPULATIVE STAFF wages memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralMy colleagues may like to know that I have been able to come to an agreementwith Mr. Geddes (the General Secretary of the Union of Post Office Workers) on terms in some ways better than those authorised by the Cabinet (C.C. (54) 27thConclusions, Minute 1). The discussion was long and difficult and there is nodoubt that, if I had not been speaking with the full authority of the Government forstanding firm, I could not have succeeded. In the end we agreed jointly to approach the Arbitration Tribunal for a clarification of their award; and to allow this process to take up till June or July. Mr. Geddes will then be free to put forward a claim for an increase on economic grounds, but our hands will be completely free as towhat we do about it. There is in fact no commitment on either side.2. This has the advantage from our point of view of making it clear beyond any shadow of doubt that any subsequent advance that Mr. Geddes may gain hasno connection with his value of work claim which the Tribunal has lately turneddown; and no connection either with the &quot; work to rule &quot; movement of the last few days. It gives him the advantage of being free to make his economic claimwhen the wages index will probably have risen further. As, however, the timing of any such claim has always been in his hands entirely, we have not, I think,conceded very much here.3. This is satisfactory, so far as it goes. It means that Mr. Geddes hasdecided to grapple with his hotheads and extremists and we must hope that hewill be successful in making common sense prevail within the Union itself. Theprospects are, I think, hopeful, but until this issue, which is domestic to the Union,has been decided we cannot be sure how matters will finally go.D.G.P.O. Headquarters, E.C. 1,13th April, 1954.46046
