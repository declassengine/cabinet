Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1954SECRETCopy No.C. (54) 1297th April, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETA NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandThere is a great deal to be said for the view that occupational health services would best be organised by local authorities. There is also a risk that industry,under pressure from its workers and assisted by tax relief, may sometimes develophealth services that overlap wastefully with the National Health Service.2. But I do not believe that we can at present contemplate developingoccupational health as a public service. Nor does it seem to me that we can settle the proper content of occupational health services by an intellectual exercise,without further experience and experiment in the field. Therefore I think thatan interdepartmental review, such as proposed by the Minister of Health inC. (54) 98, would be of more value in a few years&apos; time.3. On the other hand I doubt whether, in detail, the machinery proposed bythe Minister of Labour in C. (54) 8 is wholly necessary or desirable. I have noreason to suppose that an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee would bemore effective for the purposes set out in paragraph 10 (2) of that paper than theordinary processes of interdepartmental consultation, which have already evolvedlegislative proposals relating to various fields including shops and offices,agriculture and railways.4. There is a good case for a committee of the kind proposed inparagraph 10 (1) of C. (54) 8, which would be available to advise both Governmentand industry on developments of occupational health services, and to review suchdevelopments especially as regards co-ordination with the National Health Service.But we should, I think, be wise to avoid putting such a committee directly underthe auspices of one only of the Ministers concerned, and to adopt instead theDale Committee&apos;s recommendation that it should have an independent Chairman.5. If moreover the committee had to operate over such a wide field asproposed, considerably more extensive employers&apos; representation would be needed to cover shops and offices, agriculture and so forth. Rather than enlarge thecommittee for this purpose, I should prefer to exclude non-industrial forms ofemployment from its scope.6. My conclusion therefore is that we should endorse in principle theproposals put forward by the Minister of Labour, noting as he says in C. (54) 101that they do not prejudice subsequent review of both scope and method of provision; and that we should invite the Minister to arrange for interdepartmentalconsideration of his proposals in detail, with reference to such points as thosedealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 of this paper.J. S.Scottish Office, S.W.1,5th April, 1954.46007
