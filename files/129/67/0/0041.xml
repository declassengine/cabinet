IS^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 141CABINET office record copy copy NO.414th April, 1954CABINETFUTURE STATUS OF MALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh Affairs and theSecretary of State for the colonies the Prime Minister of Malta (Dr. G. Borg Olivier), when he wasin London for the Coronation, requested that responsibility for handling the affairs of Malta in London should be transferred to the commonwealth secretary.    In C. (53) 218 of 28th July, 1953 it was proposed that, whilstthis request should be refused, Dr. 3org Olivier might be informed thatHer Majesty&apos;s Governnnent would be prepared in principle to arrange forresponsibility for the handling of Malta&apos;s affairs to be transferred to theHome Office.    This proposal implied a future place for Malta analogouswith that of the Channel Islands in relation to the United Kingdom, without involving any substantial alteration in Malta&apos;s present constitution.    Itwas hoped that this change of relationship, whilst probably not completelysatisfying the Maltese Government, might at least go far to removing thefeeling in Malta that the Island&apos;s affairs are being dealt with on the same footing as those of the African territories.2.        The Cabinet decided that transfer to the Home Secretary should beaccepted in principle, that means should be sought of assimilating theconstitutional position of Malta to that of the Channel Islands and the isle of Man, on the general lines indicated in C. (53) 218, and that we should further study certain points in consultation with the Commonwealth Secretary(C. C. (53) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3).    The text of the message ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government, conveyed to the Prime Minister of Malta on19th September, is annexed.3.        After a General Election, Dr. Borg Olivier secured a majority bya coalition with Dr. Boffa&apos;s Malta Workers&apos; Party and was returned to office.    He has not made any formal reply to this communication, beyondindicating a preliminary view that the offer did not much appeal to him andhis Party.    He and one of his Ministers now propose to visit London onabout 18th May to discuss it and questions about emigration from Malta.He will obviously seek first an explanation of precisely what changes would follow from acceptance of the offer.     The Governor thinks that dr. Borg Olivier is likely to reject the offer, unless it is accompaniedby substantial constitutional concessions (which the Governor does notre commend).has been seeking support for a different solution. Whilst Dr. 3o*n Olivierand his -Nationalist a &quot;arty want greater constitutional foee-Jo: kiduJii-nj theremoval of most of the subjects reserved to the Governor un&apos;ir the presentMeantime, Mr. Mintoff, the Opposition Leader with tihe largest Party-.,1-
ISdyarchical constitution, and a status comparable with that held by SouthernRhodesia before Federation, Mr. Mintoff and his Malta Labour Party professto be more concerned with economic realities than with questions of prestige.    Ke advocates some form of closer integration with the UnitedKingdom, and seems prepared to face a diminution in political autonomy,and the application of United Kingdom rates of taxation, provided Maltagets in return United Kingdom social services and rates of pay, andrepresentation in the United Kingdom Parliament.5.        Mr. Mintoff recently paid a short private visit to this country,during which he had informal meetings with some Members of parliament and Ministers and with Labour Party leaders, under the auspices of theCommonwealth Parliamentary Association.    He interested himselfparticularly in the relationship of Northern Ireland to the United kingdom parliament, and appears to have gained sympathy amongst all Parties forthe idea that closer relationship on this pattern might be a solution.6.        We think it desirable to seek the approval of our colleagues, atthis point, to the general lines on which discussion with the Maltese PrimeMinister can be carried forward next month.7.        The offer will first have to be fully explained to him.    He isalmost certain to reject it, and press for his suggestion that Maltese affairs should be transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office.    But thatwould bring us back where we were, and we should miss the chance of doingsomething to satisfy Maltese aspirations.    If nothing is done now, we might find a revival, of which there axe already signs, of a movement in Maltafor integration with Italy.8.        Basically, the trouble is that we have tried to give complete self-government in internal affairs (including finance) to a territory which doesnot, and probably never will, have a viable economy.    The financial situation is not acute at the moment, as Malta is currently able, with the artificial assistance of the grant for war damage reconstruction, to balanceits own budget.    But the respite is only temporary.    Whenever Malta asksus for financial aid, while we are unable to influence the financial policies of Maltese Ministers and satisfactorily control the expenditure of grantsonce they have been made, the insistence that such grants should be limitedto the immediate need and hedged about with restrictions only increases thefeeling of bitterness in Malta that they have to come to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the role of beggars.9.        Dr. Borg Olivier &apos;s solution of this dilemma is to claim that Maltashould be entitled to a sort of annual rent from Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor the Island&apos;s strategic value.    Whether there is anything to be said forsuch a concept is one of the things that might be examined if a RoyalCommission on Malta was appointed.    The Island&apos;s economy alreadydepends upon what is spent by United Kingdom and allied forces in the island.We thus have for Malta the two opposite conceptions:Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s that Malta should be paid an annual rent and then begiven even more complete self-government, by the reduction of reserved powers, together with the placing of Malta under the commonwealth secretary;  Mr. Mintoff1 s that there should be a closer integration withthe United Kingdom economy.    Against this background, we set out belowfour possibilities.
10.       In approving the existing offer, our colleagues sympathised.withthe resentment felt by many Maltese, as European people boasting acivilisation older than our own, against a &quot;Colonial&quot; status, and moreparticularly their inclusion in the same category as the African Colonies,,The offer implies little more than a change in the United Kingdom Ministerdealing with their affairs, to satisfy this argument of prestige, though itmight qualify them for the United Kingdom Emigration Quota to the UnitedStates.     The proposal is that Malta should be placed, like the channel islands, in a special relationship to.the Queen in Council, through theHome Secretary as responsible Minister.    The Channel Islands status,however, would be more restrictive on local autonomy than the present constitution of Malta.    In the Channel Islands, although there is a largedegree of local self-government, the Royal Assent to all legislation isgiven by the Privy Council, and the Home Office are frequently consulted  &apos;about important Bills in the formative stages.     United Kingdom officialsnow play no part in framing legislation within the powers of the maltese government and ordinary legislation automatically receives the royal assent through the Governor.     The Home Office offer, therefore, allowsa certain, although limited, room for manoeuvre.     For example, it would presumably be necessary to tell the Maltese Prime Minister that the parallel with the Channel Islands would not be followed so closely as tobring about any effective restriction in the Maltese Government1 s present powers.    Dr. ?3org Olivier might also be told that the Home Office offeris a first step, that for many reasons the status of Malta could not be whollyassimilated with that of the other territories dealt with under the HomeOffice, and that the best thing would be for a clean cut to be made first ofall by transfer from the Colonial Office to the Home Office under thepresent constitution.    This would be on the understanding that it wouldnot preclude the Maltese Government and the Home Office from working out eventually a new system which would correspond more to the politicaland economic requirements of the situation.    Even so there seems little likelihood of Dr. Borg Olivier &apos;s accepting the offer and the question is whether there are any developments of it which can be &quot;seriously considered.Closer integration with the United Kingdom11.       Some attention has been paid in Parliament and the Press here toMr. Mintoffs ideas.    This has led us to consider whether there is any practical possibility of offering Malta some form of integration with theUnited Kingdom.    The solution would be a radical one, as it would meanbringing Malta into a position similar to that of Northern Ireland within theUnited Kingdom.12.      All United Kingdom legislation applies to Northern Ireland, unless otherwise stated.     Certain services (usually referred to as transferredservices) are within the jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland Parliament and government, other important services are reserved to the United kingdom parliament.    The effect of this is that the major taxes, both direct and indirect, are outside local jurisdiction.    In return, Northern Irelandreceives sufficient funds, taken together with the proceeds of local taxation,to enable it to maintain social services at approximately the UnitedKingdom level.    At first sight, the Northern Ireland arrangement mightbe expected to be unacceptable to the Maltese.    The status and powers ofthe Maltese Parliament would be considerably reduced.    Not only wouldthere be a much wider field of control from London, but a number ofimportant Departments would be directly responsible to London and notto the local Government.    In the sphere of finance, the whole of the real
power would be transferred from Malta to London, and Maltese citizenswould have to pay United Kingdom rates of taxation.    Nevertheless it is some such relationship for which Mr. Mintoff is pressing.    It is apparently his view that the practical advantages to the Maltese economy would more than compensate for the derogation from local autonomy.The return for having to pay United Kingdom rates of tax (which might not affect the majority of the population very seriously) would be a closeapproximation to United Kingdom social services and, in many spheres,United Kingdom rates of pay.    On the constitutional side, the reductionof status of Malta&apos;s own Legislature would be offset by representation at westminster,    This solution would undoubtedly present serious difficulties.Not only would it increase the burden on the United Kingdom Treasury, andon the Service Departments for the payment of wages at United Kingdomrates, but there would be the difficulty of securing administrativeefficiency.    Northern Ireland officials are recruited from the same sourceas United Kingdom officials, and have the same background.    The good willand understanding between officials in Belfast and London contribute muchto the successful operation of the Northern Ireland constitution, and theproximity of the two capitals facilitates swift and regular exchange of views and renewal of personal contact.     These favourable factors wouldbe absent in the case of Maltai13.       For the moment, the idea of integration with the United Kingdomdepends very largely on whether representation of Malta at Westminstercan be seriously considered.    The number of Maltese representatives would be about three, judging by the size of their present electorate.There are massive arguments against such a system.     First, a precedentwould be created and other territories might claim the same privileges.If, for example, Gibraltar asked for a similar status, it would not bepossible to resist on any reasoned argument.    Secondly, such a system which has some resemblance to the Union Francaise has the inherentdefect that the Members elected from these territories soon lose touchand influence with their constituents and have little or nothing to contributein the day to day life of Parliament at Westminster.    Thirdly, in a parliament where there is a small balance between the two great parties the few &quot;oversea&quot; Members might have a power over our domestic affairs out of all relation to their knowledge or responsibility.    It would indeed be a farce if on such a subject as commercial television in theUnited Kingdom, the balance of power, as it well might have, had rested with the Maltese Members.    On the first point above, however, there might be few other territories that would, in fact, seek the same position.It was only recently that Gibraltar, for instance, was strongly resistinghaving any income tax at all.    We should like to know whether our colleagues consider that some form of integration with the United kingdom on this basis should be further studied, or whether it must be ruled outab initio.14.   Some Form of Special Status under the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth RelationsIf we assess.correctly Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s probable line when hecomes here, he will begin by putting up a fight for what he originally askedfor, namely transfer to the Commonwealth Relations Office.    He may try to claim that, logically, there is no such great difference between the maltese Constitution and that of Southern Rhodesia (now the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland) that Malta could not similarly be administered under the Commonwealth Relations Office.    The answer to that is thatthere were special historical reasons why Southern Rhodesia (and alsothe High Commission Territories) came under the Commonwealth Relations
12Office, and that this was a wholly exceptional arrangement.    The function of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is that of handlingrelations with independent Commonwealth countries.     Malta, because ofits size and lack of resources, can never hope to achieve full independence.    If the previous decision were to be reviewed, it wouldseem necessary to try to evolve for Malta some kind of mezzaninestatus, under the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,coupled with the grant of an annual sum within which Malta would haveto live.    We assume that our colleagues still feel that a solution alongthese lines must be ruled out.15.   Appointment of a Royal commission the forthcoming talks with Dr. Borg Olivier are likely to leadto a stalemate, unless our colleagues consider that any of thepossibilities mentioned above can be seriously thought about, and that theSecretary of State for the Colonies can hint as much to the Maltese PrimeMinister.    Otherwise, we shall get nowhere, and as we have indicated,we do not believe that the subject ca   be let drop altogether.  We thereforeendorse the Governor&apos;s recommendation that, in these circumstances, thebest solution would be to tell the Maltese Prime Minister that a RoyalCommission will be appointed.    This would examine the working of thepresent 1947 Constitution of Malta, the financial problems of Malta, andthe question of some change in its present status.    A Royal commission would not, of course, be itself an answer to the problem, and there wouldbe some risk that it might make proposals which were not very acceptable,but which it might be then more difficult for us to refuse.    Nevertheless,we believe that, subject to what Dr. Borg Olivier says when he comeshere, the appointment of a Royal Commission would probably be the best course.    We should be glad to know if our colleagues agree.    Whilethe Royal Commission was at work, there might well be advantage in giving more detailed study to any of the possible solutions discussed above which may be held to merit further consideration.D.M.F.O.L.13th April, 1954.ANNEXFollowing is the text of the message from theSecretary of State for the Colonies to the PrimeMinister of Malta (Dr. G. .Borg Olivier), conveyedthrough the Governor on the 19th September, 1953&quot;I have been considering very carefully in consultation with mycolleagues the Memorandum which you handed to the Minister of State onthe 17th June, and am now able to let you have our comments as promised by him.    I must say at once that I am very sorry that we do not find it possible to meet you on your proposal for transfer of responsibility for handling business relating to Malta in London to the commonwealth relations Office.    In the allocation of responsibilities of Governmenthere, the function of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations isthat of handling relations with the fully independent members of theCommonwealth.    It is true that he is also charged with the responsibilityfor relations with the Central African Federation and the South AfricanHigh Commission Territories, but these are wholly exceptional arrange-ments for which there are special historical reasons.    We are very clear
that we cannot agree to any further extension of his functions beyondthe proper one which I have indicated.    I have noted what you say of malta&apos;s constitutional status and that in your recent response to the acting Governor&apos;s letter about the stationing of American Airmen inthe Island (on which you will very shortly receive my comments) youindicate that you have been considering a radical revision,   I musthowever say in all frankness that it seems to me that the position of malta as a fortress (which has given her a famous place in history andis also the source of her livelihood) must unavoidably entail someconstitutional restriction on full self-government in the fields ofDefence and External Affairs.     On account of this and of her relativesize and the disabilities imposed by her lack of natural resources, Maltais not, in the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, eligible to beconsidered for full independent membership of the Commonwealth.We have however considered with the utmost sympathy the arguments in your Memorandum and we appreciate the unique position of Malta asa fortress in Europe with a long history of civilisation and of service in peace and war most recently recognised by the exceptional award ofthe George Cross.    In these circumstances we consider that it wouldbe appropriate to transfer responsibility for handling business relatingto Malta here to the Home Secretary, who is the Secretary of Stateimmediately concerned as the Queen&apos;s Minister in relation to theUnited Kingdom and neighbouring Islands,    I am authorised to inform you that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to agree in principle to such a transfer.    The formal arrangement would be that Malta wouldbe under the authority of the Queen in Council with the Home secretary as the responsible Minister.     There could not be more signalrecognition of Malta&apos;s unique, character, and I commend this proposal tothe consideration of yourself and your colleagues.    I need not say thatI should be very ready to provide any further explanations which you may require.    To me personally it is a matter of regret that it should fall to me to put forward a proposal that will sever the long association between Malta and the Colonial Office, but if the change would accordbetter with the aspirations of the people of Malta and contribute tocloser and more cordial relations between us, I shall gladly defend it&quot;.
