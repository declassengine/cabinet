Printed for the Cabinet. March 1954SECRET CABINET OFFICE copy No&apos;C. (54) 121 RECORD COPY1st April, 1954CABINETRESTRICTIONS   ON  REPORTING   OF   proceedings for HOMOSEXUAL OFFENCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 17th March, invited me to submit amemorandum summarising the arguments for and against legislation designed to restrict publication of the details of criminal prosecutions for homosexual offences(C.C. (54) 20th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Section 1 of the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act, 1926,makes it unlawful(a) to print or publish &quot; in relation to any judicial proceedings any indecentmatter, or indecent medical, surgical or physiological details beingmatters or details the publication of which would be calculated to injurepublic morals,&quot; and (b)) without prejudice -to the foregoing prohibition, to print or publish inrelation to matrimonial proceedings anything beyond the names,addresses and occupations of the parties and witnesses; a concise state-ment of charges, defences and counter-charges in support of whichevidence has been given; submissions of law and the decision of thecourt thereon; and the summing-up, the finding of the jury (if auy) andthe judgment and observations of the judge in giving judgment.3. The provisions set out in paragraph (a), which substantially reproducedthe effect of the then existing law, already prohibit the publication of indecentmatter in reports of criminal proceedings. I take it that there is no suggestion of holding trials for homosexual offences in camera, or of prohibiting any referenceto them in the Press; and the issue seems in effect to be whether provisions similarto those in paragraph (b) should be extended to criminal trials of this kind.4.   The arguments in favour of such a course are:  (i) that the publication of full and detailed reports of these unsavoury casespanders to the salacious reader, may corrupt the innocent, and is ingeneral injurious to public morals;(ii) that sensational accounts of criminal offences may lead to their imitationby others; and(iii) that the amount of space devoted by the Press to some notorious casesof this kind may give rise to exaggerated ideas of the prevalence ofhomosexual vice and that restriction of Press reports would tend to allay public anxiety.5.   The arguments against the proposal are:  (i) Any restriction on the liberty of the Press can be justified only by a clear and compelling need in the public interest; but the sensational treat-ment of an occasional notorious case is exceptional, and the majorityof such cases are reported briefly, if at all.45962
(ii) There is a vital difference between reports of matrimonial and of criminal proceedings. Matrimonial proceedings are a civil matter between theparties. Criminal proceedings relate to an offence against the Stateand against the community and affect the liberty of the subject. Thequestion of applying to certain criminal offences the same principle in regard to publication as in divorce cases was considered when theAct of 1926 was before Parliament, and was rejected.(iii) If such restrictions were to be imposed, it would be difficult to justify a distinction between homosexual offences and other sexual offences, or,for that matter, offences such as murder, which are not in themselves ofa sexual nature, but are often closely connected with sexual offences or with allegations of sexual misconduct.(iv) The publicity given to the preliminary proceedings before examiningJustices sometimes leads to witnesses coming forward who can give evidence of value to the prosecution or the defence. Curtailment of reports at this stage might therefore be prejudicial to the administrationof justice.(v) It is in the public interest that cases of this kind, however unpleasant,should be reported, so that everyone may know that conduct of thiskind is an offence against criminal law and may realise what is the punishment for committing that crime. When trials for incest wereheard in camera cases not infrequently came before the courts wherethe accused were unaware that their conduct was an offence againstthe criminal law.(vi) If such legislation were now introduced by a Private Member and accepted by the Government, and at the same time the government announced that they did not propose to undertake any inquiry intothe law relating to homosexual offences, it would be said that theGovernment had not merely declined to hold an inquiry, in spite ofthe great and unexplained increase in such offences and of the factthat the existing law was regarded as unsatisfactory by many responsiblepeople, but were endeavouring to suppress the publication of evidence which showed the need for an inquiry.6. In my judgment the objections to legislation on the lines suggestedoutweigh any possible advantage.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W.1,31st March, 1954.
