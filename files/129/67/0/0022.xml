Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1954SECRETCABINET office record copy copy No.      7C. (54) 1223rd April, 1954CABINETLEGISLATION ON HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY in non--INDUSTRIAL  EMPLOYMENT AND  closing hours  OF  SHOPSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh Affairs, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Labour and National Service and the Minister ofAgriculture and fisheries the Home Affairs Committee have asked us to submit to the Cabinet our proposal that Bills on health, welfare and safety in shops, offices, catering establish-ments, theatres, &amp;c.; in railway premises; and in agriculture and forestry; and onthe closing hours of shops should be included provisionally in the legislative programme for next session.2. Proposals for legislation on these subjects were prepared by the Depart-ments concerned on the basis of recommendations made by the Gowers Committeein reports published in 1947 (shop hours, Cmd. 7105) and 1949 (health, welfare and safety, Cmd. 7664). The proposals on health, welfare and safety are largelymodelled on provisions of the Factories Acts. They were circulated to interestedorganisations as a basis for discussion, and comments have now been received on them. When the proposals on working conditions were circulated it was made clear that legislation would not be possible in the circumstances then existing (in1952); and no commitment has been incurred about the date of legislation onshop hours.3. The proposals in the form in which they were circulated are attached tothis memorandum, and the more important criticisms that have been made are summarised in the Appendix. This will give the Cabinet a general picture of thelegislation we have in mind and of the kind of questions which we shall have todecide, and which may lead to controversy.4. Some of the proposals and criticisms are still under discussion, and at themoment we only wish to make two comments. First, we are convinced that thesuggestion that legislation on working conditions is largely unnecessary must be rejected, both generally and in respect of railway premises: the Government are committed to legislation; the Trades Union Congress would never accept voluntaryaction as a substitute; and we are satisfied that there is a real need for legislation.Secondly, our proposals adhere closely to the recommendations of the Gower&apos;s committee which took evidence from the bodies which are now criticising them,and the criticisms raise no new issues.Health, Welfare and Safety in Shops, Offices, Catering Establishments, Theatres, &amp;c.5. This would be a large and important item of legislation, and should berewarding politically. It would mean more work for departments and localauthorities, who would enforce it, and more local inspectors (but probably notmany more). It would also mean, after a period of grace, expenditure in money,materials and labour, which it is impossible to estimate, but which would probablybe substantial. This, however, is no longer so great an obstacle as it was whenthe Committee reported.   Apart from the general objections to legislation, the45966b
comments received do not radically challenge our proposals, and it seems unlikelythat the Opposition would criticise them severely. Nevertheless, they might well prove troublesome to handle while the Government has so small a majority.Railway Premises6. The railway legislation has a twofold object. First, to apply the FactoriesActs to motive power depots where the work and mechanical risks involved arecomparable with those in factories. Secondly, to apply to other railway premisesminimum health and welfare standards similar to those proposed for other non-industrial premises. As regards motive power depots, working conditions are not good owing to the dirty nature of the work performed in them, and the applicationof the Factories Acts is long overdue in order to effect some improvement andremove some of the hazards connected with the work.7. As regards other railway premises, the legislation would entail capitalexpenditure by the British Transport Commission, but it is not intended to place an impossible burden on the Commission by requiring them to achieve high standards in all types of premises immediately. A period of grace will be allowedbefore some of the requirements are brought into effect, and it is proposed thatthere should be power to grant exemptions for limited periods to give the Corn-mission time in which to reach a fair standard. Much, however, could be achieved at little capital cost merely by maintaining in a better condition the amenitiesalready provided in railway premises. The legislation is to be administered throughthe Factory Inspectorate, and about forty additional staff might be required whenthe legislation comes into full operation. It is not expected that the proposals would provoke much opposition in Parliament.Agriculture and Forestry8. Agriculture has lagged behind other industries in the provision made forthe health, welfare and safety of its workers. At the same time, mechanisationhas made statutory provision for safety increasingly desirable. The accident rate at 35 per 1,000 workers compares unfavourably with that in industries subjectto the Factories Acts, and considerable working time is lost. The legislation would call for no great expenditure and little structural work. It could be administered largely by the existing inspectorate of the Agriculture Departments.The proposals have been generally welcomed and are likely to be non-controversial.There appears to be no good argument for deferring them.9. Under all these headings the Government is likely to be under strong pressure from the Unions and the Opposition for early legislation to give effectto the Gowers recommendations. At the 1953 Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed urging that immediate steps should be taken to ensure that no further delay occurs in implementing the report. We think there is a good practical case for early legislation, and that it is most desirable politically that it should been acted during the present Parliament.Closing Hours of Shops10. This is a completely separate subject, except that it happens to affectmany of the people who would be affected by legislation on health, welfare and safety in shops, catering establishments, &amp;c. Legislation on this subject is evenmore overdue, and there is no good reason for deferring it: it should make no fresh demands on man-power and materials and place no substantial new duties on anyone. Because of the defects and inadequacy of the existing code, there isa widespread desire for amending legislation, and it has been awaited with increasing impatience since the report of 1947. Some of our main proposals for amendment, however, have been challenged and many points of detail have been raised, and some controversy must be expected on the more important points.D. M. F.J. S.W. M.T. D.30th March, 1954.
APPENDIXCriticisms of Our ProposalsWorking Conditions in Shops, Offices, Catering Establishments, Theatres, &amp;c.1. Many of the employers consider that statutory requirements are largelyunnecessary in view of the enlightened views held by most employers; that inpresent economic circumstances the cost of implementing our proposals would be higher than the results would warrant; and that some of the proposals go too farand would create practical difficulties in some places of work.2. The Trade Union Congress propose the prescription of more precisestandards in some respects; rather more stringent requirements in others; addi-tional requirements about such things as canteens and rest-rooms; and theshortening of periods of grace for implementing the requirements.3. Some of the employers dislike the proposal that local authorities shouldenforce the legislation; the Trade Union Congress would like more supervision of enforcement by the central government.4. Some of the employers and local authorities object to the exemption ofGovernment premises from the legislation.Railway PremisesThe British Transport Commission question the need for statutory obligationsnow that the railways have been nationalised and joint welfare advisorycommittees have been established. (The Gowers Committee rejected this argument.)Agriculture and ForestryNo important criticisms have been made.Shop Hours1. The general evening closing hour should be 6 p.m. (with power to localauthorities to make it up to one hour later) instead of 7 p.m. (with power to localauthorities to make it up to one hour earlier) as we have proposed.2. The provisions about Sunday work, holidays and meal intervals should bemore flexible and less favourable to the shop assistants. This criticism has beenmade most strongly by the employers in the catering industry, who say that theworking conditions of their employees should not be regulated by legislation, but should be left to settlement by negotiation and the Catering Wages Boards. Thetrade unions, on the contrary, want these requirements extended.3. The proposals for allowing the sale of various articles when shops would normally be required to be closed should be amended in various ways. Thesecriticisms mainly reflect the rivalry between different classes of shop. Forexample, the tobacconists object to the proposal to allow the sale of tobacco in places of entertainment and licensed premises outside normal shop hours unlesslate sales in ordinary shops are also allowed.4. There should be a greater relaxation of restrictions on Sunday trading atholiday resorts in England and Wales.5. Shopkeepers object to the proposal that in order to qualify to sell food and refreshments for off-consumption outside ordinary shop hours they should berequired to register with the local authorities.45966

EXPLANATORY NOTESPART I.   CLOSING OF SHOPS1. General Closing Provisions(a) Early Closing DaysThese proposals repeat or replace section 1 (I), (2) and (3) and the first partof section 1 (6) of the 1950 Act, except for parts of section 1 (2) dealing with local orders which are dealt with later. They give effect with minor modifica-tions to the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee in paragraphs39, 40, 54 and 55 of their Report but otherwise make no change in the existing law except by the clarification introduced by the second part of proposal (iv).In accordance with the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee inparagraphs 58 and 59 of their Report, it is proposed that the whole of section (4) and all but the first part of section 1 (6) shall be revoked.(b) General Closing HoursThese proposals replace sections 2, 3 and 8 of the Act excepc section 2 (3) (a),a part of section 3 on the scope of late-day orders, and section 8 (3), all ofwhich are dealt with later. The proposals give effect to the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee in paragraphs 18-25 and 60 of their Report.In accordance with the Committee&apos;s recommendations in paragraphs 28-30of their Report, it is proposed to revoke all that now remains of sections 4 and of the Act. It is also intended to revoke section 10 (local inquiries for thepurpose of promoting and facilitating early closing) which has for many years been a dead letter, and consequentially, section 15.(c) Sunday ClosingThese proposals replace sections 47, 55, 60, 61 and 63 of the Act, which apply only to England and Wales, and section 67 which applies only to Scotland.They make no change in the existing law..2. Special Exemptions and Modifications(a) Sale of Refreshments for Off-ConsumptionThis is a new provision replacing the second exemption in the First Scheduleto the Act, paragraph (b) of the Second Schedule, and paragraphs 1 (b) and (c)of the Fifth Schedule.   It also disposes of section 49.The provision gives general effect to the recommendations made by theGowers Committee in paragraphs 33-36, 44 and 105 of their Report, exceptthat it is not intended to give a court of summary jurisdiction power to revokeor suspend the registration of a shop on conviction for carrying on non-exempted business after the closing hour.The sale of fried fish and chips has been excluded from the Sunday and half-day exemptions at the request of the trade.(b) Partial Exemption Orders on Sunday (England and Wales only)This replaces section 48 and the Sixth Schedule to the Act.The proposal is intended to meet the criticism of the existing provisionsmentioned by the Gowers Committee in paragraphs 99-105 of their Report,while adopting a somewhat different approach from that suggested by theCommittee in the concluding sentence of paragraph 105, which leaves ituncertain how bakers&apos;, fishmongers&apos; and grocers&apos; trades are to be defined.The solution proposed is similar to that suggested in dealing with the sale ofrefreshments for off-consumption. Its object is to secure both precision andflexibility and make it possible to avoid any overlap with other exemptions.
It is thought desirable to restrict the Sunday exemption to shops which do asubstantial business in the exempted articles on weekdays so, in effect, confiningit to bona fide bakers&apos;, fishmongers&apos; and grocers&apos; shops and to limit the power at present conferred on local authorities to authorise sales after 10 a.m. to cases of emergency and to one special class of case dealt with in the paragraphfollowing.(c) Holiday Resorts and Sea-Fishing CentresThese proposals replace sections 40 (1), 41 (1), the greater part of 41 (2) and section 51 of the Act.The proposals give general effect to the recommendations made by theGowers Committee in paragraphs 63-65 and 106-107 of their Report, exceptthat the Committee&apos;s suggestion in paragraph 107 that local authorities shouldbe given power to permit the opening of any shops commonly used by dayvisitors on Sunday has not been adopted since it is considered to be too impreciseand to involve an unnecessary departure from the general principle thatexemptions should be for classes of sales and not of shops.It is proposed that the existing system of Sunday exemption should becontinued but the transactions qualifying for exemption should be re-defined in the Schedule so as to meet the criticism made by the Committee in paragraph107 of their Report. The exemption for the sale of &quot; any article of food &quot; atpresent contained in the Schedule is thought to be too wide and indefinite andproposal 2 (c) (ii) (b) has been designed to replace it. This, together with the exemption for the sale of refreshments for off-consumption under proposal2 (a) above, is thought sufficient to meet the case.It has been suggested that the existing provisions by referring to &quot; placesfrequented as holiday resorts during certain seasons of the year &quot; lend them-selves to too narrow an interpretation since they appear to exclude places (suchas London) which are visited by holiday makers during the whole or greaterpart of the year and not appreciably more at one time than at another, andalso places such as cathedral cities and even certain villages which are frequentedby tourists although not holiday resorts in the accepted sense. These pointshave been met by altering the provision tentatively to apply &quot; to any place during any season of the year when it is frequented by tourists or holidaymakers &quot;.id) Exhibitions, Shows, Fairs, etc.These proposals replace section 42 (except section 42 (3) on penalties whichis covered later), section 45 (a) and the final exemption in the First Schedule.No change is intended in the existing law.(e) Christmas, Bank-Holidays and Special OccasionsThese proposals replace sections 1 (5) and 43.Proposals (i) and (ii) give effect to the recommendations made by the Gower&apos;s committee in paragraphs 61 and 62 of their Report.Proposal (iii) gives substantial effect to the recommendations made inparagraphs 81 and 82 of the Report. It is assumed that the Committee intended that it should no longer be permissible to move the early closing day to a bank holiday, since this would in effect dispense with it in that week irrespective ofthe special provisions for suspension during the Christmas period. As a corollary, where the bank holiday falls on the normal early closing day, the occupier should be required to close early on some other day in that week,except where he dispenses with the early closing day under the special provisions for the Christmas period.
(/) Jewish and Muslim Traders (England and Wales only)These proposals: (i) repeat sections 53 and 62 of the Act with an alteration in the drafting of53 (13) and 62 (2) consequential upon the re-casting of the provisions onearly closing days (proposal 1 (a) (ii) above);(ii) extend the sections with consequential alterations to include Muslimtraders who observe the Sabbath on Friday.It also seems desirable to provide for the late day to be other than Saturdayfor registered Jewish traders or Friday for Muslim traders, and to allowregistered proprietors of fried fish and chip shops the option of opening on sunday evening instead of Sunday morning, since it is mainly during the eveningthat the demand exists.(g) Non-Profit Making Libraries and Industrial and Provident Societies&apos; LibrariesThese proposals repeat section 45 (b) and section 46 of the Act in so far asthey relate to the closing of shops.   They make no change in the existing law.(h) Post Office business in accordance with the recommendation made by the Gowers Committee inparagraph 113 of their Report, it is proposed that section 44 of the Act shouldbe revoked.(/) London Street Markets, etc.it is also proposed to revoke section 54 of the Act, but to save existingorders in force under it (see proposal 12 (g) later). The purpose of this pro-vision, which was introduced by the Shops (Sunday Trading Restriction) Act,1936, was to permit London street markets and shops in certain districts of central London which by long-standing custom had carried on trade on sundays to continue to do so. No fresh orders could now be made under it,since their effect would not be limited to preserving an existing custom.3. Closing of Mixed Shops and Trading outside Shops(a) Closing of mixed shopsThese proposals replace sections 13 and 50 of the Act. They go somewhatfurther than the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee in para-graph 57 of their Report in that their object is not only to permit but to compelan occupier carrying on several classes of business to which different earlyclosing days apply, or might apply, to adopt the same early closing day for all.They also modify the recommendations by restricting the occupier&apos;s choice ofan early closing day to a day prescribed for a class of business which forms asubstantial part of the business of the shop.(b) Trading outside ShopsThese proposals replace sections 12 and 58 of the Act. They should be readin conjunction with proposal 17 (b) later which clarifies the definition of a shop.(i) is intended to give effect to the recommendations made by the Gower&apos;s committee in paragraphs 83, 84 and (as respects (i) (c)) 114 of their report and to correct the deficiency in the existing law revealed by the EldoradoIce Cream case. The effect of the clarification introduced in the second partof this paragraph is that an itinerant trader can trade every afternoon if noearly closing day has been fixed by order, but loses the benefit of thealternative day if an early closing day has been fixed.(ii) and (iii) are designed to permit itinerant traders to take advantage ofthe special exemptions introduced by proposals 2 (a) and (b) above on conditions similar to those applying to shops.
17ij4. Miscellaneous SavingsProposal (a) (i) replaces sections 1 (8), 56 (1) (a) and 65 of the Act, and paragraph 1 (/) of the Second Schedule. It gives effect to a recommendationmade by the Gowers Committee in paragraph 113 of their Report.Proposal Co) (ii) replaces parts of sections 1 (7), 2 (3) (a) and 8 (5) (a) andthe whole of section 56 (2).   It makes no change in the existing law.Proposal (a) (iii) completes the replacement of sections 1 (7), 2 (3) (a) and (5) (a) and replaces section 56 (3). It gives effect to the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee in paragraph 85 of their Report except thatthe time for which a ladies&apos; hairdressers&apos; salon may remain open after thegeneral closing hour for serving customers who were in the salon before thathour is limited to one hour.Proposal (a) (iv) repeats section 56 (i) (b).Proposal (a) (v) repeats section 56 (i) (c).Proposals (b) and (c) replace respectively section 56 (5) and (6), and by applying the savings to week-days as well as Sundays give effect to recommenda-tions made by the Gowers Committee in paragraph 114 of their Report.Proposal (d) repeats section 59 (2).PART H.   CONDITIONS OF employment. Weekly Half-HolidayThese proposals replace the following sections of the Act: section 17 (otherthan the penalty provisions), the greater part of section 21 and sections 53 (13)(a) and 62 (2) (a) in so far as they relate to the weekly half-holidays of assistantsemployed by Jewish traders.It is proposed that the following changes should be made in the existing law.(a) Assistants in the catering trade: The special provisions of section 21 which derived from the Shops Act,1913, should be revoked except in so far as they permit the accumulation of half-days (proposals 5 (d), (e) and (/)). The requirements that, in establish-ments coming under the special provisions, no assistant shall be employedmore than 65 hours in any week exclusive of meal intervals, and that everyassistant shall be given not less than a week&apos;s annual holiday with full pay inevery year, are considered to be out of date and redundant in view of thepowers now conferred on Catering Wages Boards. The requirements on mealintervals and Sunday holidays are dealt with later in the explanatory notes to proposals 6 and 7.Whereas, at present, half-holidays for catering assistants coming under theordinary law must begin not later than 1.30 p.m. and of those coming underthe special provisions not later than 3 p.m., it is proposed that the half-holidayshould begin not later than 2.30 p.m. in either case.   (Proposal 5 (a)).(b) The weekly half-holiday provisions should no longer apply to part-timeassistants. This follows a suggestion made incidentally by the Gowers Com-mittee in paragraph 253 of their Report on Health, Welfare and Safety in non--industrial Employment and the Hours of Employment of Juveniles,except that the Committee envisaged that in the case of adult as well asjuvenile assistants there should be no right to a half-holiday if the weeklyhours of work amounted to less than 25, for which the proposals substitutenot more than 30.   This seems reasonable for adults and it seems hardly
necessary that a person who, for instance, is employed for not more than fivehours a day on six days a week should remain entitled to a statutory weeklyhalf-holiday.It follows logically from the Committee&apos;s other suggestions that adult aswell as juvenile assistants who have every morning off should also lose theirentitlement to a weekly half-holiday.(c) An assistant who is a registered pharmacist should be deprived of hisentitlement to a weekly half-holiday only to the extent necessary to enablethe pharmacy at which he is employed to fulfil its obligations under theNational Health Service rota schemes. At present there is a conflict betweenthe requirements of the Shops Act and of the rota schemes which can only be resolved by amendment of the law, and after careful consideration of allpossible alternatives the solution proposed here is the only one that appearsreasonably practicable. It is suggested that the compensation that an assistantshould receive for his interrupted half-days must be left to trade agreements.(d) An assistants weekly half-holiday should be in addition to any bank holiday, but during the Christmas period it should be permissible to postponehalf-holidays for not more than four weeks in respect of any two of theChristmastide holidays on which the shop is closed. This is in accordancewith the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee in paragraphs 76to 78 of their Report.6. Meal intervalsThese proposals replace section 19,(apart from the penalty provisions dealtwith later), a part of section 21 and the Third Schedule of the Act. they make the following alterations in the existing law: (a) The same meal intervals are to apply in all catering establishmentsirrespective of whether the occupier has elected to come under the special provisions of proposals 5 (d) to (/) above. The general effect, therefore, isiO revoke section 21 (3) (c).The justification for section 21 C3) (c) was that an assistant who was requiredin certain weeks to forgo his weekly half-holiday and perhaps also to workunusually long daily hours should be given somewhat longer meal intervalsin compensation: but that to avoid interference with the requirements of thebusiness the occupier should have greater discretion in arranging the times ofthe meal intervals than was permissible under the ordinary law. The houisworked by a catering assistant during a &quot; long week &quot; are now, however, muchshorter on average than when the special provisions were first introduced in1913, and the Catering Wages Boards have specific power to deal with mealintervals among other matters. The statutory requirements are minima andit seems no longer necessary to complicate the law by retaining two differentminima for different classes of catering establishment.(b) For all shops the maximum period for which an assistant can beemployed without a break is reduced from 6 hours to 5 hours (5  hours onan assistants half-holiday); and the period of the break is increased from20 minutes to half-an-hour.(c) The provision for the dinner interval to be before 11.30 a.m. or after2.30 p.m. is confined to assistants employed in the sale of intoxicating liquorsor refreshments for on-consumption.(d) The special provisions on luncheon intervals applying to assistantsemployed in shops on market days at market towns or on the day of an annualfair are to be revoked, since it appears that there is no longer any substantialneed for them.
7. Sunday EmploymentThese proposals replace section 22 and the remainder of section 21 of theAct.   They make the following alterations in the existing law: (a) They apply to Scotland. In paragraph 256 of their Report on Health,Welfare and Safety in Non-industrial Employment and the Hours of Employ-ment of Juveniles, the Gowers Committee recommended that these provisions should be so extended in relation to juveniles.(b) Compensatory time off is to be given for any Sunday employment whetheror not the shop was open for the serving of customers. In paragraph 256 oftheir Second Report the Gowers Committee also made a recommendation tothis effect in respect of juveniles, saying it was immaterial from the employee&apos;spoint of view whether the shop was open or not if he was called upon to attendfor duty.   This seems equally true for adult assistants.(c) Whereas at present a person who is employed for more than four hourson a Sunday may not be employed for more than two other Sundays in thesame month, it is proposed that in future he may not be employed on morethan two other Sundays in the same period of four weeks. As some months have four Sundays and others five, the existing provision often makes itdifficult for employers to arrange the duty rotas, and the amendment isintended to remove this difficulty.(d) The provisions are to apply to all catering establishments irrespective of whether or not an election is in force under 5 (d) above. Assistants in establish-ments coming under the special provisions will thus be liable to be employedmore often on Sundays than at present, but on each occasion on which theyare so employed they will be entitled to compensatory time off on a week-day, for which the existing provisions of section 21 do not allow.(e) The &quot; short day &quot; to be given in compensation to registered pharmacistswho are employed on Sunday in pursuance of a contract between the occupier of the premises and an Executive Council has been modified in recognition ofthe present trend towards later opening and earlier closing.8. Employment in retail trade or business elsewhere than in a shopThese proposals: (a) replace section 23 of the Act; but(b) exclude assistants employed as itinerant vendors of ice-cream from thescope of the provisions on Sunday employment, so giving effect to the recom-mendation made by the Gowers Committee in paragraph 108 of their Report:(c) extend the provisions on weekly half-holidays and meal intervals forshop assistants to assistants employed in retail trade or business elsewherethan in a shop.9. SavingsThese proposals repeat sections 45 and 46 of the Act in so far as they relateto the conditions of employment of assistants. They make no change in theexisting law.Miscellaneous RevocationsIn accordance with the recommendations made by the Gowers Committeein paragraphs 79 and 80 of their Report it is proposed that section 40 (3) ofthe Act should be revoked.   It is also proposed to revoke: (a) section 41 (4) and (5) and the Fourth Schedule,(b) section 42 (2),on the grounds that Wages Councils and Joint Industrial Councils have adequate powers to deal with those matters and the provisions go beyond theproper sphere of the Shops Act and cause an awkward overlap between thefunctions of Shops Act Inspectors and Wages Inspectors.
PART DDE.   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT10. Responsibility for EnforcementThis replaces section 71 (1) and 73 of the Act and gives effect to recomrnenda-tions made by the Gowers Committee in paragraph 123 of their Report on the closing Hours of Shops and paragraphs 292-4 of their Report on Health,Welfare and Safety in Non-Industrial Employment and the Hours of Employ-ment of Juveniles.11. InspectionThese proposals replace sections 71 (1), (2) and (7) of the Act.In view of the devolution of responsibility in England and Wales to district councils, and of the exercise of responsibility by small burghs in Scotland, ithas been thought desirable to introduce a new provision that the same inspectormay be appointed by two or more authorities.It is not proposed to adopt the recommendation made by the Gower&apos;s committee in paragraph 292 of their Report on Health, Welfare and Safety in non--Industrial Employment and the Hours of Employment of Juveniles that asmall number of &quot; travelling officers &quot; should be appointed to form a link between the central and local authorities.Proposals 11 (b) and (c) go further than the Gowers Committee recommended.The control over the dismissal of inspectors suggested in 11 (b) is thought desirable in order to avoid any appearance of an inspector being victimizedfor doing his duty.Proposals 11 (d) to (g) adapt section 71 (2) of the Act so as to apply not onlyto shops but to retail trading elsewhere than in a shop. At present, section71 (7) (b) is intended to serve this purpose but its application is uncertain andits wording is no longer apt since it refers to retail trade or business carried on&quot; at any place &quot; not being a shop and this form has been abandoned inproposals 3 (b) and 8 above.12. Regulations and OrdersProposal 12 (a) repeats section 69 of the Act.Proposal 12 (b) gives effect to recommendations made by the Gower&apos;s committee in paragraph 68 to 74 of their Report (except the proposal that local authorities should be required to notify such local organisations as seemto them capable of representing the interests of the shopping public). Itdisposes of section 1 (2), proviso (iii), section 9, section 11, and a part ofsection 41 (1).Proposal 12 (c) introduces a measure of uniformity for which experience hasshown that there is need. At present there are numerous provisions on thescope of local orders scattered throughout the Act, the chief being in sections1 (2), 3, 8 (1), 40 (2), 41 (2), 48 and 51. These provisions differ in their termsoften without adequate reason. The express limitations that will remain arethose on periods of the year applying to holiday resort orders under proposal2 (c); those on classes of business applying to partial exemption orders underproposal 2 (b) and to holiday resort orders under proposal 2 (r) (ii) (a); andthose both on periods of the year and classes of business applying to ordersfor special occasions under proposal 2 (e) (ii). All other orders will come under the general provision. Local authorities will thus be given the followingpowers which they do not now possess: (i) To make closing orders and partial exemption orders applying toparts of the year only.(ii) To make orders for exhibitions and special occasions applying toparts of the area only.
IP9)In addition the power at present possessed by local authorities when makingweekly half-holiday orders and late day orders to fix different days for different parts of the year or area or classes of shop will be rounded off by allowingparts of the year or area or classes of shop to be omitted entirely.Proposal 12 (d) is intended chiefly for clarification and repeats what is now the accepted doctrine. It makes it clear that a shop cannot be classifiedaccording, e.g., to the type of clientele.Proposal 12 (e) repeats section 70 (1) of the Act.Proposal 12 (/) repeats section 70 (2) of the Act with a slight modificationconsequential upon the changes in procedure introduced by proposal 12 (b).Proposal 12 (g) will get rid of all existing orders except those applying toLondon street markets, etc. (on which see explanatory note 2 (/)); but weeklyhalf-holiday and late day orders will be saved for a period of one year. Theprovisions applying to the various orders and the procedure for making the mare to be so altered that a new start is inevitable. In the case however of weekly half-holiday and late day orders a period of grace seems desirable.13. Notices and RecordsProposal 13 (d) continues the provisions of section 57 of the Act and extendsthem to shops registered for the sale of refreshments for off-consumption(proposal 2 (a)) and for the sale of groceries, etc., under a partial exemptionorder (proposal 2 (&amp;)). It is thought desirable that where an exemption doesnot apply generally to a class of transaction, but is limited to registered shops,notice of registration should be posted.Proposal 13 (c) is designed to meet a complaint that some managers whoare shop assistants are not receiving the time off in lieu of Sunday employment to which they are entitled; that such managers are often required to complete and sign their own time records; and that they may be tempted to fill in andsign false particulars through fear of dismissal.14. PenaltiesThese proposals replace sections 14, 17 (3), 19 (2), 21 (5), 22 (6), 59 and 64of the Act.Proposal 14 (a) unifies and increases the penalties for infringement of thelaw but departs from the recommendation made by the Gowers Committee inparagraph 125 of their Report in that it makes no distinction between first and subsequent offences; This is in keeping with present day practice; and so arethe penalties.Proposal 14 (J?) introduces a new provision derived from section 135 of the factories Act, 1937.15. ProceedingsThese proposals replace the first four and the last two references in section71 (3) of the Act. They make no change in the existing law except by adaptingthe existing provisions to cover retail trade or business elsewhere than in ashop, a purpose for which (as explained in the note to proposal 11) the wording of section 71 (7) will no longer serve.16. Responsibility of Actual OffendersProposals 16 (a), (b) and (c) repeat section 71 (5) and (6) of the Act withcertain modifications intended to adapt the provisions to retail trade or businesselsewhere than in a shop and to give them somewhat greater precision. Themodels adopted for the latter purpose are section 136 and 137 (1) of the FactoriesAct, 1937, and (for Scotland), section 10 (3) of the Factories Act, 1948.Proposal 16 (d) is a new provision adapted from section 137 (2) of the factories Act, 1937.
17. InterpretationThe definition of &quot; bank holiday &quot; has been altered so as to make it clearthat it includes a day of local as well as of general public holiday.The existing definition of a &quot; shop &quot; has been generally held to include astall or a site for a barrow, if regularly used for retail trade, but doubt has beencast on that view by a decision in Summers v. Rooerts (1944, 1 K.B., 106).That was a case under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941, but that Actadopts the Shops Act definition of a shop. The alteration in the definition isintended to remove the doubt. The point is of practical importance chiefly as respects the voting rights of shopkeepers (proposal 12 (6) (i)), and registrationfor the sale of refreshments for off-consumption and the sale of groceries, etc.,on Sunday under partial exemption orders (proposals 2 (a) and (b), and 3).The definition of &quot; shop assistant&quot; has been altered to as to excludemanagers who are not wholly or mainly employed in serving or attending oncustomers. It was never the intention to apply the Act to managers of thiskind, but the existing definition by referring to any person wholly or mainlyemployed &quot; in connection with &quot; the serving of customers has been held toapply to managers even though they do little or no serving in the shop. the omission of the words &quot; in connection with &quot; makes it necessary in the newdefinition to refer to the receipt of money as well as of orders, to cover cashiers;and to refer to attendance on customers so as to cover, e.g., shop-walkers.FIRST SCHEDULEThe following paragraphs of this Schedule give effect to the recommendations made by the Gowers Committee in the paragraphs of their Report indicatedin each case.(a) Paragraphs 27 and 112.(b) Paragraphs 27 and 112.(c) Paragraphs 30, 31 and 112.(d) Paragraphs 29, 32 and 112.(e) Paragraph 113.(/) Paragraph 113 (but the exemption has been clarified by the sub-stitution of &quot; spare parts, fuel, and lubricants &quot; for &quot; supplies &quot;).(h), (/), 0&quot;), (k) and (/) Paragraph 114.Paragraph (g) of the Schedule gives substantial effect to the recommendations made by the Committee in paragraphs 51 and 112 of their Report, but is so framed as to avoid the difficulties of deciding what are &quot; terminal and mainline &quot; stations, etc. (or indeed what are the limits of a station).SECOND SCHEDULEThis Schedule departs from the recommendations made by the Gower&apos;s committee in paragraphs 50 and 117 of their Report in that it does notrestrict the half-day exemption to the sale of newspapers published on thesame day, but extends the existing Sunday exemption for sales of newspapers,periodicals and magazines to the half-day as well without restriction to theday of publication. It is thought that the restriction proposed by the Committeewould invite disregard of the law and that in this case the difficulties connectedwith mixed shops would be alleviated rather by extending the number ofexempted articles than by limiting them. Further, the sale of guide books,picture postcards and photographs has been added to the Schedule because
1it is thought that there is a demand, which it would be reasonable to meet,by tourists and other day visitors for these articles on half-days and Sundaysthroughout the year in many places and not merely during the holiday seasonin holiday resorts. The effect is to exempt most of the business carried on by newsagents other than the sale of books and stationery, to which different considerations apply.THIRD SCHEDULEThis Schedule gives effect to the recommendations made by the Committeein paragraphs 101, 102 and 116 of their Report. Frozen fruit and vegetableshave been added to tinned and bottled fruit and vegetables in the exceptions to exemption (b).FOURTH SCHEDULESee explanatory note to proposal 2 (c).The first five paragraphs of the Schedule repeat paragraphs of the SeventhSchedule to the Act of 1950, with some re-arrangement. Paragraph (e) is anattempt to re-define &quot; souvenirs &quot; and &quot; fancy goods &quot; in such a way as toavoid some of the abuses that exist at present. As regards paragraph (/) itis thought that the sale of precious stones and metals might with advantage be added to the transactions to provide for a more expensive type of holidaytrade and to cater for foreign tourists among others.The object of dividing the transactions into separate classes is to ensurethat no single class is made the subject of an order unless the necessarymajority of shopkeepers dealing in that class approve. Thus if an order is contemplated for the transactions in both classes (e) and (/) it will not besufficient to secure the consent of a majority of shopkeepers dealing in thetwo classes together, but a separate vote must be taken for each class.(232790  Wt. 4580-907   k3   3/54   D.L.
