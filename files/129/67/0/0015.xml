ST-secret CABINET OFFICE ^RECORD COPY copy No-c .(54) 115^^JvTARCH, 1954.cabinetTHE TRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations the South African High Commissioner came to see meyesterday to inform me that his Government propose to table&quot; a resolution in the South African Parliament requesting the transfer of the Territories,The resolution, which is set out in the Appendix to this memorandum, isthe same as that in the Appendix to Cc (54) 91 with two modifications9In the second paragraph stating that in the opinion of the House it isdesirable that the Territories should be transferred to the Union, it willbe seen that the word &quot;now&quot; has been omitted,,    In the third paragraph theform of request to Her Majesty runs &quot;request Her Majesty the Queen in her capacity as Sovereign in and over the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland&quot;,,    This correctly states the position of the queen and the United Kingdom Government, and thus accepts the position that inthis matter Her Majesty must be advised by iiev Government in theUnited Kingdom. v20 The High Commissioner said that, while he was instructed toles.ve with me the resolution which it was the intention of his Governmentto propose to the South African Parliament, they wished to bring the draftof the resolution to the notice of the Government of the United Kingdomand to afford that Government the opportunity for comment in advance.3. I said that I must, of course, refer this matter to the cabinet before I could give the High Commissioner and his Government the considered reply of the Government of the United Kingdom.    The HighCommissioner said that he appreciated that this must be so.4. I said that this new departure came as an unpleasant shockafter the talk I had had with Mr. Havenga at the time of the Coronation.The High Commissioner was familiar with the general tenor of thatconversation? but I would like to read to him the record which I had made immediately afterwards and circulated to my colleagues (Cc(53) lo9)0I read him the relevant extracts and I said that my colleagues had beenin complete agreement with the line I had taken.50 I then said that one thing occurred to me, as I felt sure itwould to him, namely that as soon as any public announcement had beenmade by the Union Government either by tabling the resolution or by someother official statement of their intention to re-open the question of transfer, our Government would be immediately questioned in parliament and would, I felt sure, have to make their position plain.    The HighCommissioner said that he appreciated this.
S36. I said that* assuming the attitude of our Go vernment was what I felt sure it must be, namely that we could not contemplate transferat the present time, then any negotiations on the issue of transfer becamepractically impossible, because it would be clear to everyone in both countries that negotiations on that issue could lead to no practical result.7. I went on to ask what possible advantage there could be in raising this question now.    To do so could only court an immediaterefusal,,    This must have an unfortunate effect on relations between our two countries, which both our Governments had been doing their best to foster and improve.    It was so important that our fruitful collaborationshould go forward, not only with the active efforts of Ministers on bothsides, but with the general support of our peoples.    I knew that was thedesire of both Governments and in that aim Ministers enjoyed popularsupport.    At no time had this co-operation been more necessary.    Inthe economic and financial sphere I had never known the collaboration of the whole Commonwealth so marked, and between no two countries inthe Commonwealth was it closer than between South Africa and ourselves ,in all that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Havenga were doingtogether.    In the sphere of defence our anxieties and our objects werethe same.    We knew the common danger we faced; we had already-concerted plans together and we looked forward to still closercollaboration in this sphere too.    In all this climate mattered a lot.0. When I turned to the Territories themselves, I found againclose co-operation over a wide range of practical matters, trade,transport, agriculture, health (human and animal), and developmentgenerally.    All that was working well and we wanted to make it workstill better to the mutual advantage of both the Union and the Territories.I was sending out my best economic man to study this on the spot and torecommend practical steps wherever improvement could be made.These were the practical things that made for increasing goodwillbetween the Union and the Territories.    It would be a terrible pity tohinder or prejudice this in any way,9. Surely the wise course was to continue our collaboration onall these fronts where there was such a wide measure of agreement and common action, and not to raise an issue on which we could not agreeand on which, if it were raised, just the sort of things would be said which were so much better left unsaid?10. The High Commissioner said that, speaking off the record andin a personal capacity, he appreciated very much the force of all this.If he might offer a purely personal suggestion it would be that, as hisGovernment had invited our comments, he would hope that in giving the answer of which he could anticipate the general sense, we would not return just a formal reply but that, if we had to turn down the mainproposal, we would at the same time express the sentiments which I had expressed to him and very much in the spirit and the words I had used.Dr. Geyer said that, while he did not know whether that would cause hisGovernment to reconsider their intention, it would certainly create an atmosphere which would greatly help our mutual relations,, if the SouthAfrican Government felt it necessary to proceed with their present proposal.11. The Cabinet have already decided that, if the issue of transferis publicly raised by the South African Government, we shall be unable toavoid a definite statement and that that statement must be that we cannotconsider transfer at this time (C.C,(54) 17th Conclusions, Minute 7).
I feel sure the Cabinet will wish to reaffirm this decision,,    At the sametime I am strongly of opinion thats in making our comments to the SouthAfrican Government,, I should., whilst stating this clearly, stress theneed for co-operation and the hope that this would not be prejudiced by raising publicly the issue of the Territories,,1E0 I therefore ask the approval of the Cabinet to reply to theSouth African Government on the following liness-(a) I would state the position of our Government onthe question of transfer as I have put it inparagraphs 5 and 6a(b) I would use the arguments for not raising this issue at the present time, very much in the language I have used in paragraphs 7 to 9eIf the Kigh Commissioner agrees (I think I must consult him on theform s particularly as he has been so helpful) I would propose to givethe answer of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in a personal letter toD;e0 JS/ialanoSWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S0Wel027TH MARCH, 1954.appendix the PARLIAMENT OF THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICARESOLUTION ADOPTED DY DOTH HOUSES OF parliament that  -WHEREAS in terms of Section 151 of the South Africa Act,1909 (9 Edw, 7, Ch. 9) &quot;The King, with the advice of the Privy Council,may, on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of the Union, transfer to the Union the Government of any territories, other than the territoriesadministered by the British South Africa Company, belonging to or underthe protection of His Majesty, and inhabited wholly or in part by natives,and upon such transfer the Governor-General in Council may undertake the government of such territory upon the terms and conditions embodiedta the Schedule to this Act;&quot;AND WHEREAS it is in the opinion of this House desirablethat the government of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate andSwaziland should be transferred to the Union;
