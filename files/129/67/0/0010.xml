(this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;3 governmentjsecret &apos;- CABINET OFFICECq(54) no RECORD COPY copy no. Lx.20TH march, 1954cabinetREPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE (ST. A LEANS) bill memorandum by the Secretary of St3.te for the Home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe Representation of the People (St. Albans) Bill, a private member&apos;s Bill presented by Mr. John Grimston, is due for Second reading on 26th March.   The Bill provides that for a period of ten years anyParliamentary elections in the St. Albans constituency shall be conductedunder the alternative vote system if there are more than two candidates.2. The Bill was considered by the Legislation Committee at their meeting on 17th March. In view of its political aspects the committee invited me to bring it to the notice of the Cabinet.3.        The great majority in both the Conservative and the LabourParties are opposed to proportional representation and the alternative vote.The Bill, however, is likely to be supported by the Liberals and, if weare to oppose it, it will be desirable to make it clear that in deciding todo so we have had regard for the Liberals1 interest in the alternative votesystem.4.        The Legislation Committee agreed that, subject to the decision ofthe Cabinet, effort should be made to avoid the necessity for an expression of the Governments attitude to the Bill;  but that, if this was not possible,the Government spokesman should take the line that the proposal was oftoo great constitutional significance to be tried out in a single constituencyon the basis of a Private Member&apos;s Bill and that an experiment in the useof the alternative vote on such a small scale would provide no usefulinformation about the merits of the system.5.        I invite my colleagues to endorse these proposals.D.M.F.Home Office, S. W. 1.19TH MARCH, 1954.
