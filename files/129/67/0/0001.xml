A NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH scheme memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the Minister of Health has proposed, in C. (54) 98, that an InterdepartmentalOfficial Committee should review the content and provision of an occupationalhealth service and make recommendations to Ministers before any step forward istaken. I would like my colleagues to consider three points:  First, this method has been tried before. Interdepartmental discussions underTreasury Chairmanship were inconclusive and led to the appointment ofthe independent Dale Committee on industrial health services whosefindings of 1951, though accepted by the Government of the day, are nowunacceptable to the Minister of Health.Second, this result is in my view not due just to Departmental disagreementon policy, but to the fact that we are still too much in the experimentalstage to be able to determine the proper content of these services and make a comprehensive plan for carrying them out we need the empiricalapproach.Third, my own proposal does not prejudge any of the issues raised by theMinister of Health; it enables them to be thoroughly reviewed in thecourse of practical experience and in consultation with the importantoutside bodies in the field, and it enables an immediate step forward tobe made.2. I feel sure that another Interdepartmental Committee will not be able tocome to definite conclusions; we shall be no further forward, and have laid our-selves open to the criticism of more delay. I hope we can proceed at once on thebasis of my proposals in C. (54) 8.W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,12th March, 1954.45868Printed for the Cabinet.
