Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1954SECRETCopy No.C. (54) 11629th March, 1954OA BINE T office record COPYCABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerAfter the Budget the Cabinet Coal Committee will be considering compre-hensive proposals for a long-term coal policy. There is however a decision aboutthe price of coal that needs to be taken before then. The Economic Policy Com-mittee have considered the question and invited me to submit a paper to theCabinet.2. The National Coal Board have reported to me that they will incur a net loss of  17 millions in 1954 unless the price of coal is increased. The main reasons(a) falling export prices;(b) the increasing cost of their growing capital investment;(c) adjustments in local piece-rates;id) the increasing cost of safety in the mines.I attach details of the Board&apos;s financial estimate for 1954 at Appendix &apos; A.&apos;3.   Two questions immediately arise:  (a) Should we forbid the increase?(b) If we allow it, how and when should it be made?4. Regarding the first question, the Board started 1954 with an accumulated deficit of  13 millions. 1953 was the seventh successive year in which they havehad to carry forward a substantial deficit and, as it is their statutory duty to makeends meet taking one year with another, I think it would be unwise for the Govern-ment to force them further into the red. I have already prevented them earlierthis year from making a general price increase designed to reduce the accumulated deficit.5. If we accept this, we then come to the question what increases the board should make to bring in the extra  17 millions they need. In the past the board have applied flat-rate increases such as that of 10 per cent, which they made inMarch 1953. If they did the same this time the increase would be 4-8 per cent.But they consider that the time has come to make more use of the price mechanismin order to influence demand, encourage fuel economy and take account of thehigh cost of production of certain coals. Broadly, their present proposals are toincrease the average pit-head prices of large coal by d\ per cent., of carbonisationcoal by 5 per cent, and of the remainder by 3 per cent. Further details are inAppendix &apos; B.&apos;6. The Economic Policy Committee agreed that if an increase had to bemade it should be a differential one rather than flat-rate. But during the discussionmy attention was drawn to the fact that the Board&apos;s proposals would mean an addition of  280,000 a year to the fuel costs of trawlers and about  3 millions ayear to railway costs. The Committee also asked me to consider whether theincrease should be postponed.are:45941
7. I appreciate the difficulties of the trawlers and the railways, but once we accept the principle of charging more for coals that are the most valuable or themost in demand, we cannot avoid treating some types of consumer more hardlyv C1 than others. Indeed, one of the merits of differential pricing is that it encouragesusers of scarce coals to use less of them. The railways, for instance, are already being most co-operative in using less of the large coal and more of the smaller sizesand briquettes. The present proposals would encourage this tendency among allusers of large coal.8. The Board propose that these price increases should come into effect on 3rd May. This date has the great advantage that it is the day on which the priceof all house coal is reduced by 10s. per ton under the summer prices scheme. this reduction will thus offset most of the increases for householders. Besides, the longer an increase is postponed, the larger it must be if it is to bring in  17 millions this year and prevent the Board&apos;s deficit from growing.Last February the miners committed themselves to an increase of 2\ per cent,in productivity this year, in return for the award to the day-wage men. I am surethe Board and the Union leaders will do their utmost to achieve this target, andif the Government were to forbid a price increase this would certainly not stimulate the miners&apos; efforts, but rather the reverse.9. I therefore seek authority to allow the Board to consult representativesof consumers about the proposals and, subject to any representations they maymake, to bring the changes into operation on 3rd May.G.
