The Commission say they need anadditional revenue of some  5 million a year from passenger transport in theLondon Area if it is to pay its way.2. The application will take the form of a new London Passenger charges scheme submitted under Section 76 of the Transport Act, 1947. There will be afull-scale Public Inquiry by the Transport Tribunal before they reach any decision.This process is likely to take some months and it is unlikely that any increases in London fares can take place until about September next. It is, of course, forthe Transport Tribunal to decide on this application: it is not a matter for me.3. The Commission will announce their intentions early next week. Mycolleagues should know of this.A. L-B.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,25th March, 1954.45934
