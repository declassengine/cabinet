The negotiations regarding the return of the German diplomatic documents which I was authorised to undertake by the Cabinet on 14th October, 1952(C.C. (52) 85th Conclusions, Minute 4), proved abortive. In May 1953 the german federal Government offered to take all necessary measures for the continuanceof the publication project provided that the documents are transferred to Germany,where they are ready to participate on a quadripartite basis with the three western governments. They offer a building and have already provided a contribution of DM. 500,000. They stated, however, that the personnel of the German ForeignOffice &quot; would be entrusted with the administration of the files.&quot;Suggested safeguards3. The United States Government have strongly urged upon Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment the advisability of accepting this offer, subject to certain safeguards for securing the integrity of the archives and of the publication project after thereturn of the archives to Germany. These safeguards were discussed during november 1953 with representatives of the United States and French Governmentswithout prejudice to the principle of transfer to Germany which was explicitlyreserved for decision by Governments. The conditions necessary to an agreement to transfer the tripartite project to Germany, of which the essential safeguard isthat the archives shall be held and administered in quadripartite, and not solelyGerman, custody and control were agreed by the representatives of the three western Governments on 30th November, 1953, and are set out in Annex A.4. A further safeguard proposed by the French and British representatives(and referred to Governments) was that the principal documents of the historicallyvery important Weimar period (1919-1933) should be microfilmed before the relevant documents were transferred to Germany. The purpose of this proposal was to secure an adequate coverage of the main lines of German policy for theuse of historians and to reduce risk of any tampering with the documents by theGermans after their return.45888b
Attitude of the United States and French Governments... 5. The United States Government have continued to press for the acceptanceof the principle of return to Germany and for the continuance of the work therewith: German participation, subject to the safeguards agreed at the Novemberconference. They have, however, shown themselves reluctant to accept a delay ofmore than six months in the return of the Weimar documents for microfilming.The French Government, in a Note dated 28th January, 1954, have proposedwhat they describe as a compromise. This provides for the association of Germanhistorians with the publication project in the United Kingdom and the return ofthe documents to Germany by stages, as they are finished with. Such a plan wouldnot satisfy the German request, supported by the Americans, for the immediatereturn of the documents.The arguments for transfer of the project to Germany under safeguards6. There are strong political reasons for accepting the principle of transferof the documents and the publishing project to Germany, subject to the agreedsafeguards. These are:  (1) Since the original offer to the Germans was made in July 1951, the bonn conventions have been signed and our relations with the german federal Government have become increasingly normal. It is desirableto retain and increase their good-will towards us. The indefiniteretention of the German diplomatic archives is inconsistent with our policy over a much wider field of basing Anglo-German relations onthe general principle of partnership in a common cause.(2) The work on the historical project is unlikely to be completed for a largenumber of years-at least ten and more probably twenty and it seems unlikely that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be able or willing to withstand for so long a period insistent German pressure, supportedby the United States Government, for the return of these documents.In these circumstances the sensible and practical course appears to beto accept the present German offer.(3) Part 2 of the General Introduction in each published volume of the documents says: &quot; Eventually the archives were brought in the summer of 1948 to England, where they will remain until more settled conditionsprevail in Germany.&quot; This statement exposes us to the argument onthe part of the Germans that conditions in the Federal Republic arenow settled, a fact which cannot be denied.Possible difficulties about transfer(a) Attitude of United Kingdom Historians7. The Advisory Committee of Historians to the British Editor-in-Chief are,however, unanimously opposed to the proposal for the transfer of the documents and the project to Germany, even under the safeguards laid down as necessary.They would &quot; feel no confidence in a publication carried out under such conditions &quot;and they add that they &quot; would be compelled to advise that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment withdraw from participation in the project if the documents have to beprematurely returned to Germany.&quot; Their views are set out in Annex B.i In the opinion of the Foreign Office Librarian, who is in close touch with thestaff of the project, it is probable that most, if not all, members of the Britishhistorical staff would resign rather than accept transfer to Germany. It wouldbe difficult, if not impossible, to replace them and a decision in favour of transfermight, therefore, necessitate the wihdrawal of Her Majesty&apos;s Government from the project. It would appear necessary to inform both the Americans and the Frenchof this possible result. &apos; &apos; ( &apos;[ &quot;&quot;&apos;   \(b) Interest of Government Departments, other than, Foreign office the Departments holding or using captured German military and technicaldocuments (Cabinet Office, Service Departments, Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research, Sec.) might regret any decision to return the diplomaticdocuments on the grounds that this decision would provide a precedent detrimental to their retention of the captured documents necessary for the projects (includingthe official histories, staff studies, &amp;c.) on which they are engaged. In my view,however,&apos;&apos;it&apos;should be made clear to the Germans that the diplomatic documents
are in an entirely separate category from the military and technical documents,and that the arrangements proposed below cannot be regarded as a precedentapplicable to the latter.(c) The Windsor PapersThe Prime Minister brought the question of the Windsor file before theCabinet on 25th August, 1953 (no record circulated). I should like to explain thepresent position orally to my colleagues,Microfilming8. The criticisms of the historians can be met by providing them with a fully adequate microfilm coverage of the principal documents of the Weimar period.To this end we should seek the agreement of the United States and french governments to the participation of their historians in selective microfilming inthis country. If they agree, the process should be completed in twelve months,after which all the papers could be transferred to Germany. If they are unwilling to participate or insist on the earlier transfer of some of the archives to Germany(together with their own historians) we should ourselves complete the microfilming.In that case, it would take longer and would be less selective.Financial and other Advantages of Return to Germany9. If we insist on keeping the archives in the United Kingdom, we shall be atloggerheads not only with the Germans, but also with the Americans. The lattermight then withdraw from the historical project in which (for financial reasons)they are unlikely to go on participating for more than a few years longer. If the project goes on for ten or twenty years, I hardly see how it could ever be com-pleted in its present form. If, on the other hand, the course which I now proposeis accepted, our own historians may resign and we may have to withdraw fromthe project. As I see it, the future of the project is thus dubious whatever we do.I therefore advocate trying to strike an early bargain with the Germans and americans on favourable political and financial terms, while accepting the factthat we may ourselves be unable to go on participating. Microfilming, althoughexpensive, will be much less expensive than maintaining the project for ten years in this country.  The estimated saving would be nearly  100,000.Recommendations10.   I therefore recommend:  (a) that the United States and French Governments be informed that we are ready to accept the principle of transfer of the documents and of thepublication project to Germany, subject to the safeguards already agreed and to the additional safeguard that the principal documents ofthe Weimar period be microfilmed during the next twelve to eighteen months before these documents are returned to Germany;(b) that we should deal with the Windsor file on lines which I will explainorally to my colleagues.A.

Publication of the German documents on foreign policy which came intoAllied hands at the end of this War has been in progress since 1947 undertripartite editorship, British, American and French. The editorial Work has been entrusted to independent scholars of all three countries working together, in orderthat it may be performed &quot; on the basis of highest scholarly objectivity.&quot;2. Although these German archives go back to 1867, it was decided to limitpublication of them to the period 1918-1945, in order &quot; to establish the record ofGerman foreign policy preceding and during Word War II.&quot;3. For convenience of publication, the period 1918-45 has been divided bythe editors into four sections to be covered by four series of volumes. In deference to public interest, in the immediate origins of World War II when the Project was first started, the editors began publication of the&apos; period 1937 onwards first; ofthis five volumes have so far appeared and three more are in the press. It is nowplanned to give priority to the publication of some of the earlier series, covering the inter-war years, about which very much less is known.4. In view of these editorial arrangements, it would be possible, withoutmaterially affecting the work in progress, to return to Germany forthwith the documents falling outside the scope of the publication Project, e.g., from 1867-1918,and, section by section, those already used for publication.5. It is our view that the German documents which are at present in use forthe publication should not be returned to Germany until after publication of that part of the work into which they fall.  Our reasons are as follows:  (a) The present arrangements for carrying out the publication are in activeoperation; to disrupt them at ,this juncture by transferring thevoluminous.archives to Germany and by the necessary recruitment ofnew, inexperienced, staff for work there^ would dislocate the project for a considerable period, involving inevitable delays, interruptions, and heavy additional expense. Such a course appears both unwise and:unwarranted.(b) But much more serious problems from the point of view of scholarshipmake us doubt the wisdom of such an arrangement,; which, in the end,will not satisfy the Germans any more than ourselves, and will certainlycause far more tension than continuing the scheme on its present basis.
(c) The essential purpose of the publication of these documents under Allied, editorship was to ensure that the suppression of vital evidence (whichwas suspected in the Grosse Politik, the official German publication of documents on the origins of World War I, and has now been proved byrecently discovered evidence published in the Times Literary Supple-ment and elsewhere) would not again occur. The return of the documents to German soil under conditions which would make itimpossible to prevent such happenings, would destroy the original purpose of the publication; it would also be viewed as an act ofrestitution and even expiation, and, by implication, cast doubts on theimpartiality of Allied editorship of the volumes so far published.id) Parity will not be established by a return of the documents to Germany onthe basis of Allied participation in editorship, since the Germans arenot, and will not be, participating in the publication of Allied diplomaticdocuments. It will be only a matter of time before this is felt andresented by the Germans. The position of Allied scholars who will then have to work as unwanted partners on German soil will becomeembarrassing. Moreover it will become increasingly difficult for theAllied historians to exercise proper controls over the Project; since theGermans will feel such controls to be offensive to them and ehrenruhrig(touching their honour). The Allied historians will therefore be com-pelled either to compromise to the detriment of historical objectivityand integrity, or to appeal to their Governments for support.(e) In the latter case political considerations are likely to enter into the matter.Should these be allowed to prevail, scholarship will go by the board;if not, the Germans with the archives in their own country, could, ineffect, break off whenever they chose.(/) On these grounds we should feel no confidence in a publication carried out under such conditions, and we should be compelled to advise that her majesty&apos;s Government withdraw from participation in the Project, ifthe documents have to be prematurely returned to Germany.(g) We should profoundly deplore the loss to historical truth which suchdevelopments might well entail.(h) It is of supreme importance that the history of the Weimar Republicshould be fully documented from the material now at our disposal, andwe therefore recommend that microfilming of the documents of thatperiod be completed without delay, whether or not there is to be anearly return of the documents to Germany. The cost of such micro-filming would be small compared with our share in the transfer of the documents to Germany and the maintenance in Germany of historiansand other British staff, however short we may expect the life of the project, once transferred, to be.(Signed)J.
