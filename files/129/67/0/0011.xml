DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (54) 11124th March, 1954CABINET&quot; OPERATION ROUND-UP &quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT&quot;A Poor Thing, but Mine Own &quot;IntroductoryFor some time I have been worried about the large number of skeletonsremaining in my Ministerial cupboard.   Some, of course, have been decentlydisposed of during the last two years; some are on their way to the burial ground.But many remain.2. I doubt whether it will be possible to deal with them all in this Parliament.But we can try.Anyway, even if the Cabinet think it more prudent, after viewing the collection,to have it dusted and put away, it will be useful for my successors to leave itproperly catalogued.3. Moreover, even if postponed, these questions must become a source of controversy at the General Election. We must either have dealt with them, or have a view about them.4. The problems are inter-related. They include (a) the structure of localgovernment, (b) the finance of local government, (c) the relation of these to centralgovernment.5. There are also some large questions regarding &quot; Overspill &quot; of population.These involve the New Towns and the Expanded Towns.I have circulated two papers to the Cabinet on these matters called &quot; new towns and Decentralisation &quot;; the first in September last (E.A. (53) 106) and thesecond on 8th March (E.A. (54) 27),6.   It may be asked whether these proposals are to be regarded as a&quot; prospectus &quot; or as a &quot;last will and testament.&quot;Events must decide.Part 1. Structure of Local government. There has been a good deal of thought and even more talk about the&quot; reform &quot; of local government: all kinds of schemes have been put forward.8. I doubt if it will be possible to legislate on this in the last Session of thepresent Parliament, but I think we should make up our minds about our general approach to this question of structure and say openly that we have done so. our plan would be the basis of legislation if time allowed; if not, it would form ourbroad election policy.
9. Appendix I describes the main problems in this field. The most funda-mental question is whether we retain the present mixed &quot; one-tier &quot; and &quot; two-tier &quot;structure, with improvements and modifications, or whether we replace it bysomething different.10. I myself have no doubt that we should choose the first course. the mixed system is long-established and everybody is used to it. The Local authority associations though both sides would like to have more of their own type of authority within the mixture accept the present mixed system as workable. Toreplace it by either a uniform one-tier or a uniform two-tier structure would inmy view be a mistake. A wholly one-tier structure would destroy local traditionsand prejudice the interests of rural areas. It would also be politically dangerous.Two-tier all round would reduce some of the most efficient and powerful units to subordinate roles. Either way there would be administrative upheaval withoutassurance of commensurate advantage.11. No solution is likely to be simple or easy going. Nearly all the possi-bilities will provoke hostility in some quarter or another. To some extent the argument cuts across Party divisions. Moreover, the complexity of the subject and the number of Departments affected makes it certain that the preparationof a practical scheme will be a lengthy process.12. Nevertheless, I think we should decide now in principle on the retentionof the present mixed structure. Then I can make a start with the preparation of proposals for its improvement. In doing this my aim would be, as far as possible,to restrict the changes to those necessary in order to deal comprehensively withthe problems involved. Paragraph 9 of Appendix I gives the general line of approach.Part 2. Finance13.   Certain measures must be taken in order to strengthen local finance.I do not believe that any substitute can be found for the present financialsystem of(a) Certain services as a national charge e.g., health, trunk roads, publicassistance, &amp;c.(b) Grants from Exchequer.(c) Rates.14. It is for consideration whether any further relief to rates can be given under (a) and (b).For my part, I think it would be much better to work back to the partnershipsystem between Central and Local Government, which is best expressed by 50 percent, grants for the various services, even if this means a greater degree ofcentralisation e.g., more trunk roads, or increasing, either on the present ora modified system general grants that is grants not related to specific services.15. As regards (c), I believe the time has come to bring to an end the&quot; derating &quot; of industry. This is the only way, other than dangerous &quot; fancyschemes &quot; (like local income tax) which can help substantially.A separate paper is attached on this, Appendix II. The questions of freight-transport and agricultural derating must also be considered. Probably the second is politically impracticable. It would, in any case, be very difficult and lengthyfrom an administrative point of view, since no assessments exist.16. Although there are many weighty objections, the abolition of deratingwill be generally welcomed by Local Authorities, and seems to me the only soundmethod of giving relief to the rates.17. The present operation of. the Equalisation Grant should be amended,broadly in accordance with the recommendations of the recent Committee (under mr. Edwards, of the Ministry of Housing).These cover alterations in the weighting factors, controls on extravagance,and direct grants to County District Councils.If industrial derating is abolished, I think these recommendations can becarried through without (a) undue opposition from the Councils who will not gain dr may lose; and(b) any appreciable amount of extra exchequer money to ease the transition.
A separate paper on this, and its relation to the proposed abolition of industrialderating, is attached, Appendix HI.18. It is next necessary to consider certain medicine which this jam willrender more digestible.Changes unpalatable to a varying degree in different areas-are necessary on the following: (a) Transfer to Local Government of responsibility for requisitioned houses,with grant aid;(b) Housing subsidies.19.   Requisitioning chiefly affects London and one or two other areas.The proposal would be to allow owners in cases of hardship to recover their houses for their own use or that of their families, the degree of hardship being settled by the County Court.In other cases owners would be offered financial inducement to acceptlicensees as their tenants. Other houses retained would be held by LocalAuthorities in their own statutory right on terms comparable with requisitioning,and the Local Authorities would become increasingly responsible for their share(50 per cent.) of the cost.This could be done in a few clauses.A paper on this is attached, Appendix IV.20. The question of housing subsidies covers a highly complicated technical and political problem. But we can only decide what to do if we have before usa specific plan.If we are to get the right balance between private and unsubsidised house-building, and encourage each to play their appropriate part, housing subsidies should be progressively concentrated on houses built in place of demolished slumsand to remedy grave overcrowding.At the same time, greater encouragement must be provided for owner-occupiers.Proposals on both these are attached, Appendices V and VI.Part 3.   Time-Table21. A White Paper will need to be prepared, for publication in October next,setting out the various proposals.22. Part of the policy must be embodied in a Bill or Bills to be introduced in November 1954 and passed in the course of the 1954-55 Session in readiness for a revaluation to operate from 1st April, 1956. It is from this date also thatderating and the changes in the Equalisation Grant would operate. The remainderwill form a forward policy for the General Election.23.   All this is based on a dissolution of Parliament in the Autumn of 1955.Part 4. Procedure24. If general approval could be given to this method of approach, I would suggest that the whole scheme might be studied in principle by a Committee ofMinisters.It might be useful to have a Committee of Officials, to go into the technicaldetails.I recognise what large issues of finance, administration and politics are raised.I also recognise that any proposals, however tentative, necessarily impinge onthe functions of other Departments-the Treasury, the Board of Trade and so on.25. But this is only a preliminary exercise. If it is thought, on examinationthat this horse won&apos;t run, then no time need be wasted on feeding and training the animal. But I hope that the idea-based on that adopted for this year&apos;sattempt to deal with Rents of having a large and comprehensive plan, ratherthan a series of niggling proposals, will be carefully considered before it is rejected as impracticable or too ambitious.H- M. .Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,24th March, 1954. ,   &apos;45830
APPENDIX ISTRUCTURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT1. The structure of local government in England and Wales is a mixed one.Excluding the County of London, there are 61 administrative counties, eachdivided into a number of county districts (which may be non-county boroughs,urban districts or rural districts). In the counties, local government services aredivided between&apos; the county council and the county district councils. This system is generally referred to as a &quot; two-tier &quot; system.2. There are also 83 county boroughs which are not included in theadministrative counties and whose councils administer all local government services in their area. These are &quot; one-tier &quot; or &quot; all-purpose &quot; authorities.3. All these units vary greatly in size, financial resources and the ability theycan command both in councillors and in permanent officials; the largest are not always the best.4. Since the war there have been many proposals for the &quot; reform &quot; of localgovernment. This is understandable since the present basic structure dates from1888 and 1894 when many fewer people lived in the towns and the services providedby local government were fewer. It is therefore only natural to find that a garmentwhich has survived two world wars and considerable shifts of population isstraining a bit at the seams and in need of attention.5.   The main problems we are facing are:  (a) The ambitions and struggles of medium-sized boroughs to attain countyborough status; Luton, Ilford and Ealing spring most readily to mind as recent examples of this. Under present legislation any borough ofover 75,000 population can promote a Bill for county borough status and there are 20 non-county boroughs eligible; 13 of these havepopulations over 100,000.(b) Persistent pressure from county boroughs and boroughs for boundaryextensions to meet the needs of their expanding populations.These two factors have been the source of much of the disquiet in local govern-ment circles; in particular, they have provoked hostility and suspicion among thecounty councils and the smaller authorities.(c) &quot; Conurbations &quot;: there are at least six of these tracts of continuous urbansprawl, each having some common problems but no sensible arrange-ments for their local government. They contain over a third of theexisting county boroughs and a good many potential ones. Moreover,jammed between the county boroughs there are county districts whose main services are controlled as part of county systems run from outsidethe area.(d) In each class of authority there are a number of authorities that prima facieare too small and need looking at. Out of 83 county boroughs 8 are under 60,000 and 17 under 75,000. Of the 309 boroughs (England andWales) 81 have less than 10,000 population and 29 between 10,000 and15,000; 279 out of 572 urban districts are under 10,000 and 86 between10,000 and 15,000; 129 rurals out of 477 are below 10,000 and 100 arebetween 10,000 and 15,000.6. All kinds of schemes have been put forward to recast the structure. Somereformers have suggested a two-tier system throughout with the upper tier on a regional basis; At the other end there are the one-tier extremists who want thewhole country organised into &quot; single purpose &quot; authorities.The Boundary Commission, a statutory body set up in 1945 and wound up in1949, proposed in their 1947 Report to keep the present structure. But a numberof the smaller county boroughs were to be abolished and absorbed into the two-tier system, becoming &quot; most-purpose &quot; authorities with more functions than othercounty districts but less than they had as county boroughs. The Commission also proposed radical alterations in, county.boundariesincluding the creation, of severalnew urban counties in the great conurbations and the amalgamation of some smallcounties.
7. Finally, there are the proposals recently put to me by four of the associations (the Counties, Urbans, Rurals and Parishes). These accept thepresent mixed system but propose a drastic reduction in the number of county boroughs and propose to put the conurbations on a two-tier basis. These proposals will not be acceptable to the county boroughs; the Association representing themand the non-county boroughs will doubtless propose an extension of the one-tier system.8. It is obvious that left to themselves the interested parties will never produce an agreed scheme. If anything is to be done the Government must make up its ownmind about it. What is more, we cannot put off a decision for ever; quite apartfrom the pressure from the Associations to do something about this problemgenerally, we are faced with private Bills for county borough status, which up to now have been staved off by praying in aid the fact that the Associations were themselves not ready with their proposals. If we do not announce soon our intention of producing a comprehensive scheme we shall have to let each decisionbe made piecemeal, i.e., by way of Private Bills.9. Assuming that the present structure should be retained as the basis of any scheme, my approach to this problem would be on these lines:  (1) We would examine the counties and consider whether there are any whichshould no longer be retained as independent units.(2) We would examine the claims of existing county boroughs to retain theirstatus; some of the small ones might be demoted. We would alsoexamine the claims of large county districts (including non-county boroughs) to become county boroughs.(3) The London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs are a separateproblem and we would leave them alone for the time being.(4) We would look at the conurbations (including the rest of Greater London)and seek a solution according to the particular circumstances. Wewould not willingly interfere with the government of the great cities; butin some cases the area might be organised on a two-tier basis. In others,the right answer might be to divide it into county boroughs.(5) In the light of decisions taken on the matters mentioned above, we would arrange for the boundaries of the administrative counties to be reviewed and settled.(6) We would ask each county to review its county districts on lines laid downby me and to submit proposals for reorganisation. The aim Would be tosecure districts, with rural and urban populations, capable of exercisingcomparable powers and duties; and to eliminate differences betweenboroughs, urbans and rurals.(7) As regards functions, one of our objects in any reorganisation would be toavoid the division of responsibility entailed in complex schemes of delegation. In short we would try to get as clear a division as possible ofpowers and duties between the counties and districts.APPENDIX IIDERATINGA. History1.   The purpose of the derating policy of 1929 was political.It was the alternative to full protection, from which the Conservative Govern-&apos;ment of the day was precluded by the pledges given at the 1924 Election.2. In a period of deflation and large-scale unemployment, it was the instru-ment of a free trade Chancellor of the Exchequer to stimulate &quot; productive&quot;industry by exempting it from three-quarters of rates normally due.3. The! original intention was to concentrate the Chancellor^ &quot; mass ofmanoeuvre &quot; (nearly  20 millions) to reinforce the weakest part of the line-the&quot; heavy &quot; industries and the &quot; exporting &quot; industries. &quot;   i
Relief to &quot;freight transport &quot; undertakings was to be passed on to selectedtraffics, like minerals and steel.4. As things have turned out, the mass of manoeuvre was dissipated fromthe beginning by the definition of &quot; productive industry.&quot; This covers stationeryor Christmas cards as much as ingots, bars and billets.Similarly, any direct link between derating of transport and rebates on certainfreights has by now practically disappeared.5. At the same time as industrial and transport &quot;derating&quot; the strugglingand impoverished agricultural industry was given the stimulus of total exemption.Before 1929, agricultural property paid a quarter of full rate.6. The amount of losses suffered by local authorities in 1929 by derating was 22-3 millions, of which  13-4 millions was industrial. (1954 industrial loss wasabout  38 millions.)This amount ( 22 - 3 millions) together with compensation for the loss of thevarious other grants and the &quot;assigned revenues&quot; (amounting in all to  16-3millions) formed the basis of the &quot; block grants &quot; which were started in 1929.About  5 millions- 6 millions were added as a &quot; sweetener.&quot;7. Under this system of &quot; block grants,&quot; all authorities were more or lessrepaid their losses.   All counties and county boroughs got some grant.8. In 1948, the transfer from local government to central government of hospitals and out-relief, made a recasting of the block grants system necessary.It was replaced by Exchequer Equalisation Grants.9. Though in principle equitable, the new system has this unfortunate result.Out of 146 authorities (county councils and county boroughs) 111 get grants and35 get no grants.So 35 feel that they have lost (by derating) a great part of their rateable value and get nothing in return out of the fund originally formed to repay derating losses.(In fact, they get all kinds of reliefs on other accounts and have no greatgrievance in theory.)The old block grants were organised on the basis of the race presided over bythe dodo (in Alice in Wonderland).   Everybody got a prize.The Equalisation Grant is more scientific. Any deserving (that is, poor)councils get a prize.  The others only have a grievance.Hinc illce lacrimai.B. Effect on Local Government10. There can be little doubt that the structure of local government has been seriously damaged by the 1929 derating (figures in Part E).11. The total abolition of agricultural rating has forced many of the countiesto become largely reliant upon the Exchequer.First we subsidise the farmers; then, because they pay nothing at all for countyservices, we subsidise the counties in which the farmers live. Since they pay norates, farmers exercise little restraining influence on local expenditure.12. Industrial derating at least leaves industry to pay one-quarter of the sumsdue. But this is not sufficient for industrialists to take a prominent part in trying to secure economical administration. They have largely abandoned local govern-ment in which they were once so prominent.The high rates of grant (sometimes as high as 83 per cent.) could be a source of extravagance and reduce the sense of responsibility of local authorities. (TheCommittee of Review have suggested a safeguard in the Exchequer EqualisationGrant System.)Yet Exchequer aid is necessary while the base of local government financeremains restricted. In effect, far the greater part of the revenue raised by localauthorities is extracted from house-occupiers and shop-keepers.j 13.   The political effect of this is dangerous.I think those of our colleagues who are most closely in touch with this aspectwould agree that our supporters feel seriously disappointed and discouraged by thecontinual rise in rates.
It must be understood that few people actually pay out cash or cheques for anytax (other than sur-tax payers). Income tax is mainly collected at the source;indirect taxation is at least largely voluntary. Twice a year comes a demand forrates-always more than the last demand. This is all a Conservative government can do for us!14. If derating (at any rate, industrial derating) were abolished, the incomeavailable (at present rate levels) to local authorities would increase by some  28millions, after making allowances for some corresponding reductions in grants.Expanding areas, with growing industry, would once more feel that industry pro-vided a source of local revenue as well as being a cause for local expenditure.15. On the 1951-52 figures the Equalisation Grants system would then work at a lower level (the Grant would be reduced by some  6 millions) and would(I think) be acceptable to all local authorities. At present, those who do not receiveanything for Equalisation Grant feel that they have been swindled out of theircompensation for derating. With at least industrial derating gone, their maingrievance would be removed.16. Unless something is done to get local financial resources widened and strengthened, we shall not be able to resist all sorts of dangerous ideas.Already there is a demand for a Royal Commission on Local Finance.This will certainly mean the opportunity for the long-haired, starry-eyed boys.We shall have all sorts of crazy and dangerous ideas the local income taxadherents; the tax on land values enthusiasts (by Henry George out of Uthwatt)and all the rest.17. If we can do something to see that other people besides shop-keepers and house-occupiers contribute to local taxation we shall be able to resist all this.To get farmers to pay something is, I suppose, beyond the bounds of possibility?But I really think we should consider whether &quot; productive industry &quot; and even&quot; freight transport &quot; might be taken off feathers and put on to an ordinary mattress.I believe it will not be very significant in terms of modern cost.C. Effect of Abolition of Derating on IndustryDirect Rating Effect of Repealing Industrial Derating18. At 1st April, 1953, the following were the rateable values of industrial premises:  Occupied for Total RateableOccupied for      Non-Industrial Total Value ofIndustrial Purposes      Purposes Industrial the Country                            .    12,457,357            1,565,931 13,023,288 347,277,89219.   It is the figure in the first column which would be troblod if derating(were repealed, that in the second column remaining unchanged. Since the national average poundage of rate is now over 20.y. in the  , the increase in rate income to local authorities would be of the order of  37 millions.20. In addition, some of the Crown properties are industrial in character.The value put upon these (including Scotland) for the purpose of contributions in lieu of rates at 1st April last was about  400,000 (out of a total of  14^ millions).If industrial derating were repealed and contributions were correspondinglyincreased about  1 million more would be added to the rateable value for Englandand Wales.  &apos;21. Rates are a proper charge in arriving at an assessment to income taxunder Schedule D and profits tax. Thus if all industry were profitable, the increasein rates to local authorities would be accompanied by a fall in the yield of incometax, etc., of nearly half the gain in rates. In so far as industry was not profitable,increased rates would presumably lead to increased prices for the industrialproducts.
22. It is commonly stated, and not challenged, that the full rating of industry would be quite a small increase of burden. On the basis of the above figures. Leuthat the increase of rates on private industry would be of the order of  37 millions,partially set off by a decrease of income tax of  18 millions to give a net increaseof charge of  19 millions (say  21 millions if Scotland is included) this compares with a total net profit of the industrial groups Mining and Quarrying, Manufac-turing, Building and Contracting for 1951 (shown in the Blue Book on &quot; national income and Expenditure 1946-52,&quot; Table 21, Items 2, 3 and 4) of  1,372 millions-an increase of burden of about 1J per cent, of the total net profits. The total grossfaia^Jrprofits of these groups in 1952 amounted to  6,242 millions, and On this figurethe increase of burden would be about one-third of 1 per cent. In the same year the wages bill of these groups came to  4,376 millions the additional rate burden would be about two-fifths of 1 per cent, of this figure.23. A Research study on Derating, sponsored by the I.M.T.A., published in 1945 but using pre-war information, came to the same conclusion. For example,in 1927, before derating, local rates expressed as a percentage of selling prices fora number of firms in Lancashire were as follows:  PercentageCotton Spinning (average of 6 firms).......... 0-68Cotton Weaving (average of 5 firms)    ...      ...      ... 0 32Textile Machinists        ...      ............ 1-30Biscuits     ............      ......... 0-72Preserves   ...      ...      ...      ............ 0-48Flour        ..................... 0-18Motors     ...      ............      ....... 0-17Similar figures for 1923 for the steel industry were as follows:  Steel Ship Plates ... ............      1-8Steel Rails ...       ........      ...      :..      ...      1-98Tin Plates...................      ...      ...      I 05General prices have since then increased much more than local rates so thatthese figures should, if anything, overstate the percentage.24. I do not believe that this additional charge, having regard to the incometax set-off, will make any substantial difference to industrial costs.The circumstances in which derating began are altogether changed, both asregards fiscal and monetary policy.D. Effect on ExchequerSummary of the Financial Effects25. On the assumption that the repeal of derating was left to benefit localgovernment without alteration of the grant systems, the following summarises theeffects on the three parties concerned Private Industry would pay  37 millions more in rates, but abate its taxliability by   18 millions-net increased charge   19 millions.The Exchequer would pay an extra  1 million in rates on Crownproperties and lose  18 millions in yield of income tax, but gain  6 millions in reduction of Exchequer Equalisation Grant. The effect on EducationGrant.might be a reduction of say,  4 millions. The net result should thus be a loss of say,  9 millions.     -The Local Authorities would increase their rates by  38 millions, butsuffer a loss of  6 millions on Exchequer Equalisation Grant and, say,  4millions on Education Grant a net gain of  28 millions. (All these figures will be affected by revaluation to an extent which cannot yet be estimated.)26. Of course, the net loss of  9 millions can be off-set by reduction of othergrants either immediately or by a transitional process. ,If for instance my proposals regarding housing subsidies, requisitioned houses and the like are accepted, the Exchequer will gain some relief.The loss to the Exchequer, it will be observed, is really all on the income taxitem. It is a paradoxical result of our high taxation that a new burden (rating)can be so largely off-set by industry from an old one (income tax).
27. Nevertheless, I think that from the long-term point of view a healthierfoundation for the only (or only effective) source of local finance-viz., rates leviedon rateable values would be a good thing.It may well protect the Exchequer from having to face one or other of theonly alternatives (a) taking over and centralising more local services like roads;(b) giving more and more grants above the normal 50 per cent, basis.E. Local Government&apos; Revenue and Expenditure28. The latest firm figures of local government revenue and expenditure arethose for the financial year 1951-52.  They are summarised in the following table.ExpenditureOrdinary expenditure of Local Authorities on general rate fund   millionsMaintenance        ......      .........      ... 735Loan Charges       .........      ......... 106Total Revenue Expenditure    ......... 841Income  millionsIncome from Rents, Fees, Licences, &amp;c.......      ... 156Exchequer Grants ...      ...      .........       - - 349Rates         ..................... 318Sums   in   lieu   of   rates   (electricity   and   railwayhereditaments, &amp;c.)   .........      ...... 14Reduction of Balances.................. 4Total Income     ................      841APPENDIX IIIEXCHEQUER EQUALISATION GRANT1. Equalisation Grant is payable at present to county boroughs and countycouncils whose rateable value per head of weighted population is below the national average. The Exchequer in effect pays rates on an amount of rateable value equalto the deficiency, at a rate in the pound sufficient to cover the actual expenditure for the year.2. The Grant payable to a county council is based on the aggregate expendi-ture of the county council itself and the county district councils in the county.The county district councils get no direct Grant, but all share the benefit of theGrant paid to the county council through reduction in the county precept; inaddition each county council makes capitation payments to the county districts ata rate per head of population which is uniform everywhere, except that urban districts get twice as much per head as rural districts.3. Criticism of this scheme comes in the main from those authorities whoserateable values per head are above the average, and who get no Grant. There are27 county boroughs (including several of the largest) and 8 counties (London and several of the Home Counties) in this position. These authorities have two maingrievances arising directly out of the provisions. (A third complaint is mentionedin paragraph 8 below.)4. The first is that the distribution of Grant is unfair because standards of valuation are not uniform throughout the country. Under the Grant formula thelower the rateable value the greater the Grant. The non-receiving authorities allegethat some authorities are getting, too much Grant because their rating assessments45830 c   :
are too loW; This grievance will be largely removed oh the coming into force ofnew valuation lists compiled for the first time by a central authority by a uniformmethod. ; .5. The second grievance arises from derating. Under the Local government act, 1929 local authorities were given compensation by means of the Block grants for their immediate losses due to derating and certain other losses. All localauthorities received a share of the Block Grants. In 1948, when the hospitals andoutdoor relief were transferred to the State, the Block Grants were replaced by theEqualisation Grant. No local authority in fact lost by the change, but theauthorities which receive no Equalisation Grant have nevertheless a strong sense of grievance because, as they say, the Block Grant which was supposed to com-compensate them for derating has been taken away from them and they receive nothing in its place; If derating of industry and freight transport is repealed this grievance!will disappear.6. The Edwards Committee which carried out an investigation into theoperation of Equalisation Grant suggested certain modifications designed toimprove the Grant distribution without appreciably altering the total amount ofthe Grant payable. Apart from one proposal made on the assumption of immediate legislation and designed to operate only for the period pending revalua-tion, their main proposals are four in number:  (a) Changes in the weighting factorsAt present two factors are used in calculating weighted population. Oneof these, the number of children under fifteen applies universally and has theeffect of giving more Grant to the areas where the proportion of children isabove the average. No change is recommended herei The other is thesparsity factor which gives additional Grant to those counties, 10 in; number,in which the population per mile of road is less than 70. The committee proposed an alteration of the formula which would extend the benefit of thisweighting to all counties with populations per mile of road less than 100, with-out substantially increasing the benefit to those counties at present covered by it. An additional 13 counties would be brought within the scope of thisweighting.The Committee also proposed two new weighting factors, which wouldgive more Grant to areas where the population has increased or decreasedexceptionally sharply. The first would apply to counties in which thepopulation has increased by more than 5 per cent, during the last 5 years, andthe second to counties or county boroughs in which the population hasdecreased by more than 5 per cent, during the last 15 years.(b) Grants to county districtsThe Committee proposed that county councils should no longer receiveGrant based upon the expenditure of the county districts, but only upon theirown expenditure. County districts whose rateable value per head of unweightedpopulation is below the national average should receive Grant based on thehown expenditure; those above the average should receive no Grant. Theformula would be the same as that used for the Grants to county boroughs and county councils, except that the weighting factors, which have little relevanceto county district services, would not be used. Capitation payments would be abolished.This,system would produce a fairer distribution of Grant in the counties;and in particular would give some Grant to a poor district in a non-receivingcounty which at present gets no benefit from the Grant scheme. On the otherhand the rich district in a poor county which at present shares in the grant payable to the county as a whole, would lose by the change, and, if it stoodalone, there would be sharp rises in rates in some areas. The committee thought transitional grants would be necessary to soften the blow; under their!scheme these were to come largely from the authorities gaining from, the,change.(c) Grant limitationUnder the present formula the Equalisation Grant is equivalent to a percentage grant payable on the whole of the net expenditure of the localauthority, the poorer the authority the higher being the percentage.   The
* 11poorest areas get over 60 per cent., and the Grant is payable withoutany special control over the expenditure.  The Public Accounts Committeehave criticised the form of the Grant as being conducive to extravagance, and. as giving insufficient control over.the expenditure of Exchequer money.The Edwards Committee therefore proposed the introduction of a scheme, of Grant limitation based . on provisions already in force in the London. Equalisation Scheme. If a local authority either spent more per head than thenational average for its class or, failing that, increased its expenditure (ascompared with a moving base period) by a greater percentage than the national average the excess expenditure would be disregarded in the Grant calculation.When considering a new project or the expansion of a service a local authority would thus not know whether or not the increase in the expenditure wouldrank for grant.(d) London Equalisation SchemeNo Grant is payable to London, where the rateable value per head is&apos; - far above the average, but there is a separate Equalisation Scheme, similarto the main scheme, under which metropolitan borough councils with rateablevalues per head of weighted population below the average for London receivepayments towards their local expenditure. The Scheme is financed by arateable levy on all the boroughs, which is added to the London CountyCounciTs precept, so that the scheme is paid for by the richer boroughs.The weighting factors used in the main Scheme are not used; the populationof each metropolitan borough is weighted in proportion to the amount ofindustrial (i.e., derated) rateable value in the borough. There is a limitationscheme similar to that described in (c) above.The Committee proposed the replacement of this Scheme by a new oneunder, which, subject to a limiting factor based on the percentage increasein expenditure, 70 per cent, of the expenditure of all the metropolitan boroughson local services would be pooled and met rateably by all the boroughs asin the present Scheme.7. The Edwards Committee&apos;s proposals were formulated against the existingbackground; they assumed enactment without waiting for the revaluation, andof course with industry derated. The Committee&apos;s proposals have been acceptedby the Rural District Councils Association, but not by the other local authority associations. Their opposition is not, however, directed to the detailed changes proposed, which are in the main acceptable, but in part is based upon the major issues of derating and standards of valuation referred to in the earlier paragraphs,and in part is due to the fact that, if the proposals stood alone, many local authori-ties would lose Grant under the Committee&apos;s scheme. As already stated, the major issues would disappear if the proposals were brought into operation on the revaluation and if derating were abolished at the same time. Moreover, the gainswhich local authorities would receive from the abolition of derating would largelyoffset the losses from the new scheme. Some transitional grants would probably in a few cases still be necessary, but these would be comparatively small. Thus,in these conditions, legislation to put the Committee&apos;s proposals into effect shouldcommand a wide measure of support amongst local authorities.8. The foregoing proposals would do nothing to remove one grievance felt by the county boroughs and London authorities. Since 1929 these authorities,unlike the counties, have received no grant towards the maintenance of classifiedroads. The loss of this, grant was one of the items for which compensation wasgiven in the Block Grants, but the compensation ceased with the change toEqualisation Grant in 1948. This grievance has received some renewed prominencewith the prospect of highway development. It could be cured only by restoring the grant. The cost to the Exchequer of this concession would be of the order of 5 millions a year..summary. As part of the general proposals (including the repeal of derating) I should propose to implement, by legislation operative at the revaluation, the reeom-mendations of the Edwards Committee for amendment of the formula forEqualisation Grants including:  (a) changes in the sparsity factor and two new factors to take account of sharpincreases and decreases of population;45830
(b) payment of grants direct to county district councils;(c) a limitation upon expenditure ranking for grant;(d) amendment of the London Scheme of Equalisation;(e) transitional grants so far as necessary to soften the impact of the change.It is for consideration whether anything should be done to remove the long-standing grievance of the county Borough Councils and London authorities that,unlike the county councils, they receive no grant for highway maintenance.APPENDIX IVREQUISITIONED HOUSES1. During the early part of the war it was necessary to requisition houses toprovide homes for the bombed-out. The practice continued after the war for people inadequately housed, any local lethargy by the housing authority beingcountered by squatting and by the appearance of groups of &quot; vigilantes &quot; whobroke into empty houses and admitted the inadequately housed. Whenrequisitioning started it was reasonable that its net cost should be borne by theExchequer. Now, nine years after the end of the war, when there are still about70,000 houses accommodating some 100,000 families held on requisition, it is apolitical and an administrative embarrassment.2. Politically it is troublesome because a number of requisitioned housesbelong to people who want them back to live in themselves or for the use of theirown families. Some of these people are organised in the Requisitioned property owners&apos; Association, a noisy but ineffective body. The Association claims thatthere are about 10,000 houses in this category. There are no precise figures, butthe real number is thought to be between 5,000 and 8,000.3. Administratively it is bad because the loss on the service is still borne bythe Exchequer and amounts to roughly  5 millions a year. Although in law theserequisitioned houses are held by the Minister of Housing, my Department have notthe staff nor the organisation to be large-scale landlords; the whole management of the properties is therefore delegated to the local authorities in whose areas thehouses are situated. The local authorities, since they have no financial interest inthe service, have no incentive to efficiency or economy. There is no doubt that many local authorities run the service extravagantly and have long since beenusing the houses as an addition to their normal pool of accommodation.4. At the peak the end of 1947 about 94,000 properties were held onrequisition for housing purposes. When we took office the number had beenreduced to about 86,000. If these properties were spread evenly over the country,it would be possible, though troublesome, within four or five years to persuadelocal authorities by administrative pressure to derequisition these houses and either (i) buy or lease them, or (ii) make other provision for accommodating the families living in them. This would not be popular because local authorities wouldnot like giving up a pool of houses which costs them nothing.5. My predecessor set up a Working Party on which the London CountyCouncil and the Associations of local authorities affected were represented. Thisrecommended methods by which they expected certain local authorities couldsolve their local problem by different terminal dates fixed according to its sizein the area.6. I am, of course, continuing to do all I can by administrative action basedon the Working Party&apos;s recommendations to reduce the holdings. The rate of release has already been increased. In the 14 months between October 1951,when we took office, and the end Of December 1952 approximately 5,400 houses were released and the 8,100 families who lived in these either settled in underpermanent arrangements or found other accommodation. In 1953 some 9,000properties were released and 13,300 families rehoused. I shall continue this pressure.7. But, unfortunately, some 45,000 houses in which 78JO00 families live are concentrated in the areas of 48 local authorities, almost all of them in the London
Region (details are given in Annex I). The Working Party confessed that theycould find no solution of.the problem in these 48 worst-situated areas and saidthat they must leave this hard core of the problem to the Government to solve.These 48 authorities cannot derequisition all these properties and otherwiseprovide for all the families living in them within any reasonable period of time.They could only do so if they devoted all their newly-built dwellings to thepurpose. This is politically and morally impossible. Special steps must thereforebe taken. My proposals are outlined below. Legislation will be necessary tocarry them out.8. I propose that the owner who wants his house back for his own or his family&apos;s occupation should have broadly the same rights as the owner of rentcontrolled property; i.e., he will be able to go to the county court, and if he canprove that greater hardship is imposed by refusing him the return of his propertythan would be created by dispossessing the licensee, then he can get his house backwithout proving that alternative accommodation is available.9. This will only deal with a small part of the problem. Clearly the most,satisfactory answer to all the difficulties would be for the owners of requisitionedproperty to take back their houses and to accept the sitting licensees as their tenants. This would create the minimum disturbance; but we could not force this on owners by legislation. Legally the owner is entitled to have his propertyreturned to him with vacant possession; he has tended to insist upon this righteither because he has been able to get a higher price for his property if he couldsell it with vacant possession than he could if it were occupied, or because he wishes to be unfettered in the management of his property. Prices of existing houses are falling, and this difficulty may be diminishing. He still, however,objects to taking a tenant not of his own choice, all the more because many of the families local authorities have put in these houses are of a pretty poor type. If,however, we could give the landlord a &quot; sweetener,&quot; as compensation for sacrificinghis right to have his property back with vacant possession and for accepting a tenant not of his own choosing, he might well be prepared to take back his housewith the sitting licensee, or a tenant nominated by the local authority. I suggestthat the landlord who agrees to do this should be paid a bonus of twice his annualcompensation rent, in addition to the compensation to which he is entitled underthe present law when his property is released. [Note: The rent he could charge on release would be the controlled rent if the house had been let before it wasrequisitioned, or if it is a new letting then the rent can be reviewed by a RentTribunal] I am sure that this would be the cheapest way out and would cause theminimum of political and social trouble. It would, for instance, be much cheaperthan providing a grant under the proposal in paragraph 11 below.10. I cannot be sure how far the remedy suggested in paragraph 9 above would be effective, and someone must manage the houses while the owners make up their minds about the offer. There are many requisitioned houses which theowners do not want back on any terms; there are others which local authorities will find it necessary to retain for a long time. The main trouble is that the localauthorities control these houses but have no financial interest in them. I thereforewish to transfer by statute the right to possession of requisitioned properties, notreleased by 31st December this year, to the local authority at present managingthem on my behalf; and at the same time reduce the Exchequer payment by stagesto half the loss, the difference falling on the local authority. Even on these termswe cannot justify the indefinite continuance of what was an emergency scheme.The new arrangements would therefore come to an end after five years, i.e.,31st December, 1959. Local authorities&apos; tenure will then cease, and they musthand back any properties they still hold under these powers to their owners.- 11. Although the newr financial arrangements will spur local authorities towind up the scheme, those with a large number of requisitioned houses will notbe able, with the best will in the world, to do this in five years. This is especiallytrue since a proportion of local authorities&apos; new building will be concentrated onreplacing slums and their net gain in new houses will be smaller in future than inthe past. We must either face the long continuance of these essentially emergency powers or help local authorities to buy houses which they cannot release withinthe five years. Some houses can be bought and run on self-supporting terms, butothers can only be run at a loss to the. Council.   To meet such cases I consider that,
as a last resort, a subsidy of up to 50 per cent, of the cost of purchase of housespurchased within the five-year period should be paid to local authorities. Thissubsidy would be discretionary and not automatic. It would only be paid if a&apos;local authority could satisfy my Department that they could not settle theirproblem in five years without this assistance. Even then a grant of 50 per cent,would only be paid in the most exceptional cases. Exchequer aid to meet theannual loss would cease as soon as a Council purchased, and no other grant, e.g.,under the Housing Act 1949, for improvements, would be paid in respect of anysuch house.12. 482 local authorities holding some 6,000 houses (9,000 families) are undernotice to release all their requisitioned houses by 10th December this year. I shallpress these authorities to keep to this timetable and none of the arrangements out-lined above will apply to them. Some may, however, fail for various reasons to release all the houses they hold by 10th December. Their case can be met bytransferring possession of these houses to them with authority to hold for one yearonly and without any Exchequer aid towards any loss.1.3. It is difficult to estimate the total cost over five years of these arrange-ments. The present annual charge to the Exchequer of  5 millions should fallsteadily, ending, of course, in five years. But as property is released, ownersbecome entitled to compensation under the present law for the deterioration oftheir property while it has been held by the Government. This may amount to 20 millions.14. I must warn my colleagues that these proposals will not be welcome tolocal authorities, since the immediate effect will be to thrust a heavy burden on therates of those Councils which hold a large number of properties. In some of thesecases the families first put into the properties were importees from other areas.The situation will be worst in London, where the addition to the rates in the L.C.C.area, if borne evenly over the whole county, would be equivalent to about a6d. rate (roughly half the gain from the repeal of industrial derating). In fact, this burden will be much heavier in some metropolitan boroughs, the extreme casebeing Chelsea, where the additional rate burden would be Is. 6d. (Annex II), unlessthe County Council help. It may therefore be necessary in negotiation with localauthorities to provide for Exchequer aid as suggested in paragraph 10 above to beon a reducing scale starting at 80 per cent, instead of immediately dropping to50 per cent.15.  In sum I propose:  (a) Owners of requisitioned houses wanting them for their own or theirfamiliies&apos; use to have broadly the same rights as owners of rent-controlled houses.(b) Owners of requisitioned houses prepared to accept sitting licensees astenants to be paid an addition to the terminal compensation to whichthey are at present entitled.(c) All other requisitioned houses to be transferred, by statute, to localauthorities, this holding to end in five years.(d) The Exchequer share of the loss on these houses to be reduced from100 per cent, to 50 per cent, (by stages if necessary).(e) A discretionary grant of up to 50 per cent, to help local authorities buyrequisitioned houses, where necessary.These proposals will form part of my general proposals for the reform of locaLauthority finances.

APPENDIX VHOUSE BUILDING FOR OWNER-OCCUPATION1. The following action has been taken, or is contemplated, for the encouragement of house building for owner-occupation.2. Licences have, since 1st January, 1954, been obtainable automatically (i)for individual houses of a superficial area of up to 1,500 square feet and (ii) by abuilder for up to 50 houses up to that size; and applications from builders for licences for more than 50 houses have been determined by the Ministry of works in the light of the comments of the local authority through Whom they have to bemade.3. It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the numbers of licencesgranted for house building month by month since relaxations from control beganon 1st January, 1953. These numbers in England and Wales in 1953 varied some-what widely between 5,764 and 8,513; and it may be significant that the numbergranted in January, 1954 was 8,600, a post-war record.4. Advances. Loans for house purchase are made by private individuals, by insurance companies and by local authorities, but the great majority are made by building societies.5. The building societies normally advance about 70 per cent, to 80 per cent,of their valuation of the house. Since few houses, even of 1,000 square feet super -ficial area, can be bought today for less than  2,000 (and many cost much more) and since the building societies tend to value on an investment rather than a cost basis,the would-be purchaser has to put down more than  400 cash, and at the same timefind money for legal charges and stamp duty.6. Under section 5 of the Housing Act, 1949 an advance made by a building society in excess of the sum it would normally advance may be guaranteed as to two-thirds of that excess by a local authority (including a county council), and theMinister, with the consent of the Treasury, may undertake to reimburse from theExchequer not more than one half of any loss sustained by the local authority under that guarantee.7. These powers have not been much used, but negotiations with the building societies Association and the Associations of Local Authorities have resulted inthe formulation of two complementary and standard schemes capable of beingoperated simply by the signing of a standard form of guarantee. I hope shortly tocircularise all local authorities exhorting them to operate these two schemes. Thefirst scheme provides for an advance of 90 per cent, for any house the price orvaluation of which does not exceed  2,500, and the second for an advance of 95 percent, for any house built after 1918 costing or valued at up to  2,000.8. Local authorities. Under section 4 of the Housing Act, 1949 (and to anarrower extent under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts) local authorities(including county councils) may themselves advance up to 90 per cent, of the cost(or value) of buying or building a house. These powers have been used to a limiteddegree and in a haphazard and unco-ordinated way. Consultation with the associations of Local Authorities has resulted in the drafting of a circular, whichI shall shortly be issuing to all authorities, exhorting them to make greater use ofthese powers and to consult together with a view (i) to securing a greater degree of standardisation of terms and procedure within administrative counties and (ii) then to making these facilities more widely known.9. Stamp duty was reduced in the 1952 Budget and compares as follows withthe period 1910-47Cost of House 1952 1910-47    s.   d.     s.   d.Not exceeding  500     ...      0   10  0 per cent. 0   10  0 per cent. 500- 3,000     ......      1    0  0 1    0  0 3,000- 3,450 ...      1   10  0 1    0   0Over  3,450 ...2    0  0,, 1    0  045830 d
For &quot; the small man &quot; the comparison is not so favourable as it looks, for beforethe war a house could be bought for  500 involving a stamp duty of  2 10s.;to-day the same house costs not less than  1,500 and its purchase involves astamp duty of  15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer may be able to consider some further reduction.10. Amendments to the Existing Law.-The preceding; paragraphs set out what has been, and is being, done under the existing&apos;law. The following pointshave been suggested for consideration in connection with any amending legislation.11. Building Societies. At the outset of the negotiations which have ledto the formulation of the guarantee schemes mentioned in paragraph 7 above, theBuilding Societies&apos; Association expressed dissatisfaction with their treatment bythe local authorities, and represented that a direct guarantee from the exchequer would be much more effective and save them labour and time in administration.The Treasury&apos;s provisional view is that a direct Exchequer guarantee is not practicable. Under the existing practice the building society values the house,examines the credit-worthiness of the would-be purchaser, and satisfies itself as tolegal title, &amp;c. The local authority enters into the guarantee, and stands part ofany loss thereby incurred. Thus there is a local check, effective though not complete, on the building society&apos;s assessment of each case involving a guarantee.The elimination of the local authority might mean that some comparable localcheck would have to be substituted.12. Insurance companies now make many more advances for house purchasethan they did when the first guarantee provisions were enacted in 1923. Theiradvances are generally made in conjunction with an endowment policy, whichextinguishes the loan at maturity or on the death of the insured if this occursearlier. Some of the bigger insurance companies would like to be able to competemore vigorously with the building societies for house-purchase business, and wouldlike to participate on equal terms with the building societies in the guaranteeschemes foreshadowed in paragraph 7. This cannot be arranged under the existing law, for section 5 of the Housing Act, 1949 specifically refers only to building societies. The desirability of amending the law to admit insurance companies tothis form of guarantee is being examined; a possible political objection is thatinsurance companies are not limited in their profit-making activities, as building societies are by the Building Societies Acts.13. Local Authorities. As stated in paragraph 8 above, the present lawlimits the advance local authorities may make to 90 per cent, of the mortgagesecurity. Should this limit be increased to 95 per cent.? This question also isbeing examined, but since up to now local authorities have tended both to valueproperty conservatively and to make advances of less than the statutory limit, itseems doubtful whether raising that limit would have any beneficial effect.APPENDIX VIHOUSING SUBSIDIES1. In &quot;Houses The Next Step&quot; we set out the broad policy which webelieve necessary to improve housing conditions. Part of this policy is beingtranslated into action in the Housing Repairs and Rents Bill, but to make itcompletely effective we must alter housing subsidies.2.   We said in &quot; Houses-The Next Step &quot; :-&quot; Private enterprise must play an ever increasing part in the provision ofhouses for general needs &quot;; and&quot; The ever increasing burden of housing subsidies .... cannot continue indefinitely at the present rate.&quot;3. These principles must govern our review. But any change must not be so large and abrupt as to be difficult to defend, nor must it reduce the number ofhouses built in any one year. Further, subsidies must encourage local authoritiesto concentrate on slum clearance.
&apos; 4. The,ultimate objective must be to get rid of. the general needs subsidyaltogether, and to keep subsidy only for houses, built in place of slum, housesdemolished. But I do not think that we can jump straight to that. The shock, tolocal authorities and to the, building industry would be too great.5. I propose, therefore, that while keeping the Exchequer subsidy broadlywhere it is now ( 25 per annum for 60 years) for every house built in replacement of a slum house, and possibly forjagricultural houses which at present receive an exceptionally.&apos; hjghliiij^^ it sharply for houses&quot;&apos;&quot;Built for general needs. I &quot;propose that we should reduce it to  15 per annum for60 years. The figure is quite arbitrary: it rests upon the assumption that with thenormal pool of subsidised houses and with adequate rents (see paragraph 10 below)it should suffice.This would, if my general proposals are approved, be announced in the autumn of this year, and would affect houses started by local authorities after the end of195^or a little before. The precise method would be to apply the new reducedsubsidy to nouses completed after October 1st, 1955. If my colleagues think thistoo soon, the effective date could be postponed till April 1st, 1956, but if the comingcut had been announced 18 months before there would be a very awkward period in which authorities would scramble to start.houses qualifying for the highersubsidy.6. For simiplicity of administration i should like to have only two rates of subsidy:  25 for slum replacement,  15 for general needs. But i am afraid thatthat would not meet the needs of the situation. There are many local authorities which still have thousands of families on their housing lists, who are not living inslums, but who are living in badly overcrowded conditions and for whom theauthorities could not build houses at rents they could pay without a somewhat higher subsidy. There are also local authorities with a less serious overcrowdingproblem but without the normal pool of subsidised houses from which to drawfinancial support, or for various other reasons in difficult financial circumstances.7. I therefore propose that an intermediate subsidy of  20 per annum for60 years should be available, at the discretion of the Minister, for nouses built forgeneral needs, where the Minister is satisfied that the authority cannot build houses for those who need them at rents which they can afford to pay unless this additionalhelp is provided.8. A disretionary subsidy of this kind would be very difficult to administer.The conditions which authorities must satisfy in order to qualify for it would haveto be indicated in the statute. They might possibly be that the authority has an exceptionally large number of families.living in overcrowded conditions, and thatits rates, both the general rate and the housing rate, are exceptionally high, or thatthe proportion of existing subsidised houses is exceptionally low. But what wasmeant by &quot; exceptionally &quot; would be very hard to define in practice.It might be that the higher discretionary subsidy should be given simply forall houses built to abate statutory overcrowding, without financial test.The various possibilities will be examined further if my colleagues agree with me that we must provide a higher subsidy to be given at discretion to deal withthe areas in greatest difficulty; and where-it is clear that provision will not be madeby private enterprise.9. A higher subsidy than  15 will in any event be needed for houses built in new towns and for houses built by local authorities to relieve other congested areas.10. I must explain to my colleagues that behind the proposal to reducesubsidies for general needs lies an endeavour to force local authorities to put up their rents, Many authorities are charging only 13^., 14^. or 15^. for 3 bed-roompost-war houses, and even lower rents for their pre-war subsidised houses. Mostauthorities make the same charge whether the tenant can afford to pay more orwhether he cannot. Recently a Sub-Committee of the Central Housing AdvisoryCommittee (the Brooke Sub-Committee) recommended that authorities should con-sider a complete review of their post-1919 rents, so that the rent of each dwellingmight be fairly related to its size, location and amenities; thereafter adopting a differential rent policy to look after tenants who can only afford low rents. Followingthis Report local authorities of different political complexions are beginning toadopt such policies; and if they will do this thoroughly they would bring money
into their housing revenue accounts (statutory accounts covering all housingtransactions), which would enable them to keep down the rents of houses builtwith a lower subsidy, when it is necessary to do so.11. Local authorities are now required by statute to make a contribution from the rates (which is some proportion of the Exchequer subsidy) for everyhouse they build. For post-war houses it is one-third. Jjgn^ose that this obliga-tion should bejabqlished^both for houses drawing the new fater^&quot;luT5^5r33aLiit&quot;&apos;&apos;for alFthe houses they have built in the past. Local authorities will then be free todecide whether they will make their housing revenue, account balance by paying a contribution from the rates or by raising rents. This is not without risk sincelocal authorities may to that extent, be encouraged to try to get the  20 subsidyrather than the  15 subsidy. ThV-advantage is that this will encourage councils to adopt a rational rent policy by charging economic rents to those tenants who can afford them, since higher rents will mean they can reduce rates. It alsoavoids the necessity of defining what we regard as the proper rate charge to correspond to the new Exchequer subsidies of  15 and  20.12. I cannot be sure of the effect of these alterations in subsidy on localauthorities&apos; willingness to build houses. Nor is it possible to forecast the numberof houses likely to be built by private enterprise in 1956 and onwards. It may be &apos;that the level of the subsidies I propose will be unnecessarily high. consequently it will be necessary to take power to vary downwards by order any or all of thesesubsidies. (The present subsidy is at a flat rate, and I cannot vary that basiswithout legislation.) ik13.   I have outlined in Appendix V the action I have taken to assist &quot;private building.   I hope this will increase the number of houses built privately&apos;and I do not consider that any subsidy should be given for these houses.14.   In addition to these major proposals a number of minor alterations in-some of the special forms of subsidy may be necessary, e.g., the subsidy for houses^and flats on expensive sites.15.   There is no doubt that these proposals are politically explosive and may &apos;be hotly opposed.   They will need a great deal of thought before we reach final conclusions.APPENDIX VIIMy proposals regarding the problem of &quot; Overspill,&quot; and especially regardingthe New Towns, are contained in E.iA.*&apos;(53) 106. and E.A.
