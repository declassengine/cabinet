Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1954SECRETCopy No.  g3C. (54) 1399th April, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am glad that the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance has broughtthis matter before the Cabinet, for this is one of the most difficult problems we have.2. I naturally weighed all the considerations with great care and sympathybefore my Budget speech, and this is what I said:  &quot; I am not unmindful of the many other claims on the Exchequer, whichthe Government would wish, in equity, to satisfy. Some of these for instance,the problems of the old people are very much in the minds of every Memberof this Committee, not least myself. But I have described the already heavy and growing burdens on the Exchequer and I must say this to the Committee:that I cannot bring my conscience to sanction further advances in social reform,involving increases in public expenditure, until we have the growth of our existing commitments well in hand. Only then can we make further progressin meeting some of the claims which are pressing upon us.&quot; My right hon. Friend the Minister of National Insurance, and indeed the whole Government and all Members of this Committee, have continuallyin mind the needs of the old people. But no one who reflects for a momenton the immense burden which the working population, and particularly the younger generation, will have to carry in the interests of elderly retired people,could think it right to reach a decision about the future welfare of the oldwithout the fullest consideration of the effect on the cost which future genera-tions will have to meet. This is the year in which a review of the national insurance Fund is taking place the first comprehensive review under thenew legislation. Moreover, the Phillips Committee is investigating the prob-lems of an ageing population. It will be useful to have the results of thosereviews. But our urgent task, in the interests of the old, is to ensure that theoutlook for public expenditure as a whole is less menacing than it is at present.&quot;3. I am sure that we must check the growth of our total expenditure before we embark upon new social spending, however strong the case for this may be.In particular, it would surely be wrong for us to go forward to increase pension benefits without taking action at the same time to mitigate the burden on the nextgeneration.4. In pensions, what we must watch is always the ultimate cost and not justthe cost in the first year. In February, 1953, the Minister of Pensions and national insurance and I circulated a report by officials (C. (53) 59) which set out the facts.This showed how the expenditure on retirement pensions is likely to doublefrom 1953-54 to 1977-78. It showed how the total expenditure on national insurance benefits will rise by over  400 millions a year, with no increase in theincome; and how the National Insurance Fund, which is at the moment in balance,will in the course of the next few years move rapidly into deficit, requiringExchequer Grants of  417 millions in 1977-78 plus a regular  68 millions exchequer contribution. The load on the Exchequer in the next 25 years is due to grow,with a cumulative increase of  17 millions a year.46026
25. It was, of course, this picture Which led rrie to set up the Phillips Committeeto advise us on -these matters. -Whenever we -consider the pensions problem, this long-term impact is what must dominate our minds.&apos;,6. &quot;In C. (54) 138 the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance shows thatthe effect of increasing the basic standard benefit for a single person by 5.y. wouldbe to add a further  58 millions a year to the Exchequer grant of  41.7 millions ayear required in 1977-78. If we were to do this, the annual cumulative increasein the load on the Exchequer would be raised from  17 millions to  20 millions.7. Even the immediate financial impact would not be quite as favourable as might be thought at first sight. The Minister of Pensions and National Insuranceshows a net saving of  6-^ millions in the first full year, which would offset mostof the cost of the increased war pensions, leaving only a small net Exchequercharge. But there are other considerations which enter into this picture, as theMinister would certainly agree:  (a) The saving is achieved by ;a reduction of  17 millions in national assistance. This would imply that 1  million people who are at presentgetting benefits for themselves and their dependants supplemented by National Assistance would receive no net advantage from the-increase in the pension rate. There is no reason in equity why theyshould, and the figures in paragraph .2 of.the Ministers paper are verystriking in that they show how generous the present assistance scalesare. But we should be - under very heavy pressure indeed for acorresponding increase in assistance scales.(b) The illustration postulates increases in;contributions.ranging up to Is. 2d.in respect of an employed man (National Insurance only). TheExchequer would in effect he paying a substantial part.of this by lossof tax revenue; about two-thirds of the employees&apos; contribution is giventax relief, and the employers&apos; contribution is of course allowed as an expense, so that the cost is,borne.either.by the Exchequer in loss of taxrevenue or by consumers generally^in increased prices.8. I must stress both the : long-term financial burden and. the short-termindirect losses to the Exchequer, and-I must say again that we should not bejustified in increasing the benefits without, at the same time taking effective steps to relieve the burden on the,next generation.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,9th April, 1954.
