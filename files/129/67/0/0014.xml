...................................ANNEX ^     ^I pointed out to Dr. Ehard that the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)was the most urgent European question of the moment and said that many of the critics of the E.D.C. had not even taken the trouble to understand its provisions andsignificance.2. Dr. Ehard entirely agreed and said that for him the E.D.C. was. vitally important from the following three points of view:  (i) It was needed to complete the defences of Western Europe.(ii) It was only through the E.D.C. and similar institutions that a realEuropean sense of community could grow up. Without it, there was little hope in the long run of solving the problem of Franco-Germanantagonism, for which the Germans in recent history were much to blame. He attached even more importance to this aspect of the E.D.C.than to the first aspect of the defence of Western Europe.(iii) From the internal German point of view, the E.D.C. was a real need.German rearmament of one kind or another was bound to come. Itwas most important for the future of democracy in Germany as wellas in Europe that German rearmament should not come through aGerman national army and the reconstitution of the German GeneralStaff but through a European army in which the Germans had to mergetheir own interests with those of other European countries.3. Elaborating this latter theme, Dr. Ehard said that the prime need inEurope was to prevent the old national differences growing up again; It was essential to give German youth the ideal of a more united Europe. He hoped thatthere would be ever-increasing co-operation between the really vital forces in western Europe. He mentioned, in particular, the youth of the various countries and the Churches, both Catholic and Protestant.4. Dr. Ehard then mentioned the federal structure in Germany as a usefulpattern for the future structure of Europe. He recalled that Hitler had gainedabsolute control of Germany by breaking down the old German federal structure.If a similar federal structure could be extended to Western Europe as a whole, andthe E.D.C. would be an important step to that end, the chances would be less of western Europe as a whole, or of any individual European country, falling undersimilar evil influences again.5. Dr. Ehard then turned to the role of the United Kingdom. He said thatour traditions and our experience and knowledge of Europe were essential to thesuccess of the present attempt to build up a new Europe. He was not so much concerned with the exact degree of our technical association with the E.D.C. aswith our continued presence and influence in Europe. The Americans had learneda lot and Europe owed much to them, but they had not the same experience andthey could not be relied upon to the same extent.6. I told Dr. Ehard that I was in very general agreement with the. views hehad expressed and that it was our firm intention to maintain the closestassociation with Europe. Indeed, we had just made proposals to the French andto the other five E.D.C. countries which I was sure provided satisfactory proof of this. But they were not bargaining proposals and really did represent theextreme limit to which we could go, given our other overseas interests.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd March, 1954.
