CABINET OFFICE ^ cqSECRET RECO RD COPY Copy N0&apos;   6 0C. (54) 1232nd April, 1954CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE: THREE-POWER DISCUSSIONSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade we have concluded our discussions with the Americans and the French on thesubject of East/West trade policy. It may be convenient for my colleagues if I tell them how the matter now stands.2. Mr. Stassen made it clear that he thought our Short List went too far andthat he was not at present prepared to give up the application of quantitativecontrols in all cases. But, after some very frank exchanges, we reached agreement on the broad objectives which we should seek, namely that we should try to get a substantially shorter list of controlled goods and should see that the controls onthe shorter list are more effectively enforced.3. Detailed discussion of the controls will, of course, have to take place withthe other fourteen nations concerned in the Paris Group, which will meet on13th April. The Americans have expressed themselves as being strongly opposed toour tabling our own Short List in the Group. They prefer that the controls shouldbe reviewed category by category. They say that at the moment they are not readywith their own views on the whole range of these controls, and in any event they donot, of course, want, any more than we do, to reveal any unnecessary division ofopinion between us.4. I have told the Americans that we are prepared to accept their category-by-category method of examination on the basis that we and the French open discussions with them on Tuesday next on these categories of most urgent im-portance to us, starting with machine tools, rolling-mills, and electric generatingequipment. If the three of us reach agreement we can take a common line in thediscussions in Paris. If we fail to agree I have reserved complete freedom to tableour Short List in whole or in part when the Paris discussions open.5. I am sure it is right that we should have used every effort to carry the americans with us so far, and that we should continue to try to persuade them tocome as close as possible to our point of view. But I do not think that we shoulddepart very far from what we ourselves regard as the right solution to this problem.Since the Cabinet approved our Short List we have received orders, mostly in thefield of machine tools, rolling-mills and generating equipment, worth some  40millions, of which about  25 millions is caught by the present controls, and thereare enquiries for much more. Under our proposed controls we should be free to export almost all these goods. It is our view that this trade can be done withoutadding materially or significantly to the Soviet war potential, and I do not think we should be prepared to prohibit it.6. My colleagues will, therefore, see that while we have reached a wide measure of agreement on general principles, we shall have to judge during thecourse of the next few weeks how far we can pursue in Paris a common policy with the United States. In the last resort we must be prepared in my judgmentto sponsor in Paris what we ourselves think to be the right solution. I shall, ofcourse, refer this matter to my colleagues if and when that moment arrives.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,1st April, 1954.45979P. T.Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1954
