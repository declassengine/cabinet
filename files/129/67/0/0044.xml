secret. (54) 14412th April, 1954CABINETREVIEW OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of trade at the Session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.)last autumn, we and the other Contracting Parties agreed that the time was athand to review the Agreement in the light of experience and to consider to what extent it would be desirable to amend or supplement its provisions and organisa-tion. 15th October this year was provisionally accepted for starting this review,but it was recognised that some postponement might be necessary.2. A firm date for a start with the review has. still to be fixed. Fora number of reasons we have favoured postponing this till early in 1955 but theUnited States Administration are now understood to be insistent that it should start in November, since it will be one of their major aims (as recommended bythe Randall Commission) to secure in the course of 1955 the Congressionalapproval for the G.A.T.T. which has hitherto been lacking.3. It was agreed at Sydney that the review of the G.A.T.T. should be preceded by a Commonwealth meeting in London at high official level. Whetherthe review -starts in November as the United States wish or in the New Year aswe should prefer, it is clear that the most convenient time for this commonwealth meeting will be early in October. This sets the date for the formulation of ourown line of policy since we shall want to be able to circulate in the summer amemorandum -to the Commonwealth to form the basis for discussion at theCommonwealth meeting.4. The review of the G.A.T.T. will be an event of much significance, inter-nationally and politically; and it will be essential that at the commonwealth meeting we should be able to give a firm and clear lead to the rest of the Com-commonwealth on what we want to see emerge from it. The review will take placeagainst the background of the aims to which the Commonwealth have affirmedtheir adherence at the successive Commonwealth Conferences, and the programmeof action in the field of commercial policy and external economic relations whichthe United States announce to implement the recommendations of the RandallCommission^ Report. Developments in the United States over the next fewmonths will, of course, have a very important bearing on the review and itsoutcome.5. The general line which we have taken on the G.A.T.T. publicly has beenthat it is to our advantage as a nation so heavily dependent on a widespread and diversified export trade to have an international code of good behaviour in trade matters. And while the G.A.T.T. in its existing form has defects and diffi-culties for us, it possesses positive merits which are too little recognised.In particular, it ensures tariff stability in foreign markets for an important sectionof our export trade, it embodies very necessary rules to safeguard the tariff con-cessions from frustration by other methods of trade restriction and it provides a forum for discussion of trade problems. But, if we are to accept and to defend the G.A.T.T. as a more or less permanent instrument which will bind us and other46042&apos; CAB! H If T office record copy copy No.Printed for the Cabinet.

fcl22nations, we shall have to satisfy ourselves, by a thorough examination of its pro-visions and of the policy implicit in them, that it is as satisfactory as we can makeit (given that it is something which must be agreed with the other nations who aretp/be bound by it) and we must decide on what changes in the present provisionswe should press for in the review.6. The main questions on which we shall need to determine our attitudebefore the Commonwealth meeting and, subsequently, the G.A.T.T. review itselfwill, I think, fall under three main heads: -(i) The general limitation of the G.A.T.T. on the extension of existing, orcreation of new, preferential arrangements. We have taken this up with the Commonwealth. They have endorsed the value of existingpreferences, but we have not secured support for seeking an amend-ment of the G.A.T.T. to allow for their extension. We have ahead of us the important and difficult task of securing a better public under-standing Of the realities of the position. I have had some extensivestudies made of certain aspects of this problem, and shall in due course be circulating a paper on it.(ii) The rules governing the use of quantitative restrictions and discriminationfor balance of payments reasons. The provisions of the G.A.T.T.dealing with these matters are bound to come under examination inthe review. They are crucial to our own commercial policy in relationto convertibility as the Chancellor has put it succinctly, progress towards freer currencies must go hand in hand with progress towardsfreer trade.(iii) Other amendments or extensions of the G.A.T.T. which we might want to seek. These include such questions as a strengthening of theG.A.T.T. rules relating to the use of export subsidies and the desirabilityof incorporating in the G.A.T.T. provisions imposing obligations oncreditor nations and certain chapters of the draft Havana Charter, e.g.,those dealing with commodity policy and full employment.7.   We shall need to consult organised industry and commerce on thesematters, and we have already begun to do this in an informal way.8. The purpose of this memorandum is not to seek decisions on any ofthese points at this stage, but to warn my colleagues well in advance that this is a subject to which we shall have to devote much thought and attention during thecoming months, so as to be able to give a clear lead at the commonwealth meeting in the autumn. The issues involved are complex and difficult. But in essence they affect us all, for they are bound up with the whole of our general policy on external finance and convertibility and on such matters as the use of quantitative restrictions, tariffs and subsidies; and what we do or do not do about the G.A.T.T.may affect our whole position as a trading nation. And there is lying behind all this a public relations problem-to explain our policy to our supporters and thepublic at large. In view of the range and importance of these problems I am anxious that they should be given wide consideration by all the Departmentsconcerned and that, in short, they should not be regarded as esoteric mysteries tobe dealt with by the Board of Trade alone. Accordingly, I would propose that weshould agree (a) to appoint an ad hoc Ministerial Committee, analogous to thatwhich presided over the preparation of material and the formulation of policy forthe Commonwealth Economic Conference, charged with the duty of consideringand recommending to the Cabinet a statement of our desiderata in regard to thefuture form, scope, &amp;c, of the G.A.T.T., and (b) to appoint an interdepartmental committee of-officials under Treasury or Board of Trade chairmanship to examinethe issues involved and to prepare material for consideration by the ministerial committee..      .
