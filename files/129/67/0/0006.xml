C. (54) 10618th March, 1954SECRETCABINET office record copy copy No.   gCABINETTELEVISION BILL: PRESS AND OTHER COMMENTSMemorandum by the Postmaster-general  attach a summary of Press comments on the Television Bill.2.   Of the more important prospective programme contractors:  (a) Both the Associated British Picture Corporation and the Granada Cinemainterests consider that the Bill provides a good workable basis for thescheme.(b) The Deputy Managing Director of the Broadcast Relay Services says thathe is not at all worried about the restrictive powers in the Bill. his experience, over 25 years, in operating an agreement with the PostOffice for broadcasting relay services has shown that, although theagreement has many severe restrictive conditions, no difficulties at all have arisen in practice..(c) The Associated Broadcasting Development Company welcomed the Billon its publication, but have since changed their minds. They have,in fact, recently withdrawn their application to be considered as a programme company, but whether this attitude will persist remains to be seen.3.   Of advertising and commercial interests:  (a) The Association representing advertisers considers the Bill is a good one and thinks it provides a framework within which a practical scheme can be worked out.(b) The Association representing advertising agents thinks that the Bill isa good one.(c) The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee of the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce has informed me that the Bill shouldnot frighten programme companies or advertisers. He said &quot; it wasnot a bad Bill&quot; and made a number of helpful suggestions which weshall be able to deal with after the Second Reading. The only pointof principle he raised was in relation to Clause 4 (6), the &quot; nosponsoring &quot; clause, which he thought was much too tightly drawn.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,16th March, 1954,45882Printed for the Cabinet.

Newspaper	......     Comment on the Bill	Comment on proposed grant of  750,000The: Times   ...      ...	No comment. ......      ...      ....   ...   . ..... ...	Has gone a little of the way towards meeting the views of critics of the commercial television plan.Manchester Guardian	The Government has tried so hard to make commercial television respectable that it has made its scheme almost unworkable from the start	This suggests that the Government is finding no enthusiasm among advertising interests for its scheme and is taking the first step towards financing a rival B.B.C. with a commercial bias.Daily Telegraph	The Government has gone far indeed to meet the fears of the opponents of commercial television. Indeed the safeguards seem over-elaborate	What might have proved a serious defect in the scheme for commercial television will be removed or at any rate greatly mitigated.Daily Mail......	The scheme will at least give an alternative service to the B.B.C., but it is so hedged about with restrictions that it gets lost	Daily Express      &quot;...	Studded with controls to ensure that the public gets what Whitehall thinks it wants	It is wrong that the public should be forced to pay for commercial television out of licenceNews Chronicle	If the country is going to approve commercial television in principle the Bill provides as good a framework as anyone is likely to devise. It raises as many difficult questions as it solves	fees.Financial Times	The question now is not whether competitive television will debase standards, but whether it will work	Daily Sketch	Independent television, very British, non-political, decent and surrounded by a forest of do&apos;s and don&apos;ts has been born	Daily Mirror        ...		Part of the viewers money will go to the B.B.C&apos;s. rivals.Daily Herald		The Governments plans grow more and more scandalous. The job should be paid for by those who benefit commercially.The Recorder	The Governmenfs championship of freedom of the air is to be qualified in so many ways that it almost becomes a case of giving something with one hand and taking back three-quarters of it with the other	The Sunday Times ...	Involves such a complex of checks and balances that criticism or experience may prove it altogether too cumbrous	Yorkshire Post	An ill-omened scheme. It will not provide better, livelier, more varied and enterprising television programmes than an alternative programme under the control of the B.B.C. which is the test from the pubiic&apos;s point of view	The proposal is preposterous. Why should the private enterprise body be subsidised in this way ?WesternMorningNews	The Bill proves the sincerity of the Governmenfs profession to pay attention to all valid criticisms of previous White Papers. Time will show, but the Government is said to&apos; be convinced that the plan is workable	The Scotsman	The Government, leaning over backwards to placate their	This can always be invoked to justify close	critics, have produced a curious hybrid of private enter-prise and public control	supervision of commercial programmes.Glasgow Herald	The total effect of this Bill can hardly be other than to condemn the new service to a dull mediocrity possessing none except the material attributes of free enterprise	The Government have not even half met the objection of their critics. The grant will not give the new television authority an independence equal to newspapers.Worlds Press News ...	A remarkable feature of the many comments which have been made about the Television Bill is that there is no general discernible pattern of opinion either for or against the Governmenfs proposals. The Bill is fiercely opposed by some, accorded a half-hearted reception by others and acclaimed as a sensible solution by yet a third group. Every sort and degree of reception has been registered so that anyone approaching the problem with an open mind will be hard put to it to decide whether the proposed set-up for British commercial television is sound and sensible and whether or not it will work	The Economist	The fairest conclusion must be that if the scheme proves financially viable it can do no great harm; while if it quickly becomes insolvent it may do a great deal of good. In sucn an eventuality the I.T.A. would almost certainly tend to produce more programmes itself	The decision that the I.T.A. is to receive an independent income of  750,000 a year from viewers licence fees and will produce some programmes itself is welcome.Birmingham Post   ...	Although some of the safeguards may prove difficult to apply, by and large, however, the Bill goes far towards overcoming the objections to which the Governmenfs first scheme was open	This provision will go some way to ensure that the new authority is independent in fact as well as name. Independence is an essential condition for the exercise of fearless control.
Newspaper	Comment on the Bill	Comment on proposed grant of  750,000Daily Despatch	Commercial television is to be subject to controls never thought of in Broadcasting House. In fact it is the B.B.C. all over again but with five or six minutes taken out of every hour for advertising	wouldn&apos;t &apos;t it have been more sensible to hand over this money to the B.B.C. to assist it in starting its own second television programme as quickly as possible.Sheffield Telegraph ...	A plan for a dignified presentation of good programmes to which it would seem no one can take objection, but would not viewers rather it remained in the hands of the B.B.C:	Advertisers Weekly ...	The first reactions of the advertising industry to the Tele-vision Bill are favourable and restrictive legislation is refreshingly absent. Some criticism is directed against the rather nebulous nature of the Bill notably as regards magazine programmes, shopping guides and the use of documentaries
