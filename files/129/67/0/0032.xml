(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)confidential.(54) 132CABINET office record copy copy NO.   6^44-6th April, 1954CABINETUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THEEUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY;CONSULTATIONS WITH THE commonwealth memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations at the Cabinet meeting on 21st January (C.C,(54) 4th Conclusions,Minute 2) I was authorised to obtain the views of other commonwealth governments on the proposal that the United Kingdom might enter intoa contractual association with the European Coal and Steel Community,on the basis that the United Kingdom were disposed to favour such an association.    Their replies (which represent comments of officialsrather than, the considered views of Ministers) are summarised in the annex.2.        It will be seen that, while only Canada and New Zealand haveexpressed themselves in favour of our entering into such an association,no other Commonwealth Government is disposed to raise any politicalobjection to the proposals.    Their comments have related almostentirely to the possible effects of a closer association on their own economic interests.    While some Governments have expressed some concern at possible adverse effects on their own economies, they arenot opposed to our entering into a contractual association.VIEWS OF OTHER COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTS on united KINGDOM PROPOSALS FOR CLOSER association with THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITYCanada has from the outset supported the conception of theCommunity, particularly from the political and strategic aspects.    she would be favourably disposed on broad political and economic grounds tothe United Kingdom entering into a closer association with it.Economically the Canadians would see advantage in the associationexposing the Community to the effects of greater competition from theSWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office,S.W.1.6TH APRIL, 1954.ANNEX
1^8more efficient United Kingdom steel industry, since more competitivesteel products from the Community, particularly as regards exports to north America, might improve the economic position of the community countries.    The Canadians view the Community as a possible alternativesource of supply to Canada for steel products.    They stress, however,that they dislike in principle regionalism and restrictive trade and price-fixing practices and that their concurrence in the proposed form of closer association is based largely on the special circumstances ofthe case.    They apparently would not regard as of major significancefor Canada&apos;s steel exports any loss of Canadian preferences (vis-a^vis the Community countries) in the United Kingdom and Colonies.Australia expresses some concern at the possible effect onAustralian steel exports of the loss of existing tariff preferences(vis-a-vis Community countries) in the United Kingdom, steel market,access to which is important to the Australian iron and steel industryin the present stage of its development.    In other respects the australians accept the assurances which we have given them e.g. thatassociation with the Community would not operate so as to prejudice the objectives of multilateralism in trade and convertibility of sterling.They are confident that in negotiations with the Community the UnitedKingdom would have due regard to Australian interest.    They ask to beinformed of the progress of such negotiations, to enable them to make abetter assessment of the likely effects of association on their interests.New Zealand would welcome on political grounds theestablishment of a contractual association between the United Kingdom andthe Community, and attaches special importance to the effect which suchan association is likely to have in preventing the domination of theCommunity by Germany.    New Zealand affirms her support fordevelopments towards greater integration in Western Europe, and feels that closer United Kingdom association could provide a desirablestiffening for such policies.As regards her economic interests, New Zealand accepts ourassurances that we shall continue to have special regard to the interestsof Commonwealth countries as steel consumers.    The New Zealandersthink that their interests might be adversely affected if common policieswere adopted by the United Kingdom and the Community towards thirdmarkets, and have some fear lest our closer association with theCommunity might be a precedent for our giving preferential treatment to European agricultural producers under the &quot;Green Pool&quot; proposals.But they are confident that the United Kingdom would so develop itsassociation with the Community as not to prejudice the interests ofother Commonwealth countries.South Africa comments that the Union authorities appreciate that the contractual relationship proposed takes into account politicaland other important factors, and that they do not therefore wish to offercriticism in the interestssolely of narrow commercial and economic considerations of direct concern to the Union.    They have confinedthemselves to putting forward the results of a preliminary study of theway in which the proposed relationship of the United&apos; Kingdom with theCommunity might affect the Union&apos;s economic interests.    Reference ismade to the fixing of maximum export prices by the United Kingdom and community in times of shortage and to the possibility of market sharingbetween the United Kingdom and the Community with the result that Unionconsumers might have to pay higher prices for their steel imports.
Apprehension is also expressed at the possible effects of the loss of theUnion&apos;s preferences on her steel exports to the markets of the african colonies.    (Note: the fears expressed in the latter connection and inregard to the effects of market sharing with the Community are not infact well founded).India and Pakistan have no comments to offer.Ceylon has not so far expressed any views.
