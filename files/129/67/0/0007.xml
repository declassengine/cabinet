Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1954CONFIDENTIALCABiHLl office record copy copy No.C. (54) 10718th March, 1954CABINETREGIONAL organisation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 13th October last, the Cabinet considered a proposal to close the regional offices of Government Departments in Cambridge and Reading (other than civil defence regional headquarters); and, in view of difficulties which some Ministersfelt about this proposal, I was asked to work out a modified plan for reorganisingthe regional offices in these two towns (C.C. (53) 57th Conclusions, Minute 6).2. Since the Cabinet discussed the matter, the Ministry of Food have closedtheir office at Cambridge and the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Supply have established joint offices serving both Departments. Several other departments have effected staff economies in their regional offices. The result of all these changesis to reduce the staff saving which a general closing of regional offices in Cambridgeand Reading would secure from about 400 to 200.3. The position has been examined again by the Departments concerned andthe general view is that the project of rolling up all the regional offices in Cambridgeand Reading on adjoining regions (principally the London Region), as a generalmove to be completed within the next year or eighteen months, should be abandoned. Some Departments, especially those with large numbers of local offices to supervise, have never felt happy about the proposed shutting of regional offices in Cambridge and Reading: the cost of the transfer of staffs to london would be considerable: and the difficulties of finding suitable office accommoda-tion in London have increased in recent months.4. I suggest that we accept this recommendation against a general shuttingdown in Cambridge and Reading, but that, as hitherto, Departments should consider closing, or reducing the functions of, their regional offices whenever thiswould result in economy, provided that it can be done without serious detriment to their efficiency or to the work of other Departments. The possibility of achieving economies in this way should always be considered when work decreasesor is reorganised.5. If my colleagues agree that our general policy should be on the lines indicated above, then, where necessary, Departments should give a broad indication of these decisions to the staffs concerned in Cambridge and Reading. They mightbe told that an early and general closing down of regional activity in Cambridgeand Reading will not now take place, but they should not, of course, be given theimpression that all existing regional offices are to be maintained indefinitely.6.   I regret that we cannot go further, but the above is the best advice Ican give.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,17th March, 1954.45883
