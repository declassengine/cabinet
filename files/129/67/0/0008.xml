Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1954SECRET Copy No.CABINET OFFICE vyC (54) 108 RECORD COPY18th March, 1954CABINETINDO-CHINANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed letter fromMr. R. H. Scott, the Minister at Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Washington, toMr. W. D. Allen, Under-Secretary in charge of Far Eastern affairs in theForeign Office.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,17th March, 1954.annex the best I can do in the way of a &quot; comprehensive appraisal &quot; of presentAmerican thinking about Indo-China is this summary:  first, Indo-China has &quot; top priority &quot;;second, the Americans are baffled and frustrated and do not know what to do;third, they know what they will not do. They will not accept a settlementlikely to lead to Communist domination of South-East Asia. They willnot intervene with combatant American forces in Indo-China.2. It is very important that you in London should realise the importance attached here to Indo-China. It is the issue of the moment, outranking Germany,Middle East, Korea, and all other &quot; sore spots.&quot; So, when I say that Indo-Chinahas &quot; top priority,&quot; I mean precisely that. Next, when I say that the americans will not accept a settlement likely to lead to Communist domination, I mean thatthis will be their attitude however much the French incline to a settlement on any terms. If the French push through a settlement of which the Americans disapprove,then we shall be in for an &quot;agonising re-appraisal&quot; with a vengeance. Theconsequences could be far reaching, affecting the whole of French-american relations and reacting on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.3. Finally, when I say that the Americans will not intervene with combatantforces in Indo-China, I do not mean that come what may they never will. All Imean is that this is their present policy. The general trend is against adventuresoverseas.  This trend will not be easily reversed.4. The American attitude, as I have described it, may appear illogical. Itcould be argued that the Americans must either come forward with a constructivealternative, or accept a French solution. I do not think that the Americans would accept this argument. They would be more likely to denounce a French solutionthat seemed unacceptable to them, reserve their position, and conduct their45885
agonising re-appraisal by means of intemperate and acrimonious public debate inwhich everyone, from interventionists to isolationists, would have their say.5. It follows, I believe, that the Administration will try to prevent such a situation arising. They may bring discreet but very strong pressure to bear onthe French to maintain the military effort in Indo-China and at the same time tofake such political action (even freedom to secede from the Union) as will (in theAmerican estimate) produce a real leader in Vietnam who can wean nationalistsupport away from the Viet Minh. It is not a pleasant prospect for France, and indeed, even if the European Defence Community is ratified, French-american relations may be under severe strain in the coming months.6. A clearer picture of American policy should emerge after Dulles&apos;s returnat the week-end, and after they know the latest French ideas. So this is no morethan an interim reply.  We shall try to report again in a week or two.(Signed) R. H. SCOTT.Washington,10th March, 1954.
