The United States Government believe that theproposed warning, which would carry the threat of naval and air actionagainst the China coast and of intervention in Indo-China, would causeChina to cease helping the Vietminh.    The United States Government havealready approached the French, Australian and New Zealand governments as well as ourselves and attach such urgency to their proposal that president Eisenhower has pressed it in a personal letter to the PrimeMinister and is prepared to send Mr. Dulles to London for discussionsthis week.2. The proposal to organise the collective defence of South east asia on a wide basis to include participation by both the United States andthe United Kingdom is to be welcomed.    It could remove the anomaly ofour exclusion from ANZUS and contribute to the security of Hong kong and Malaya.    At the same time, with the Geneva Conference in prospect,I have grave misgivings about the timing of the proposed arrangement.There appears to be no likelihood of a French military collapse in Indo-China between now and the Geneva Conference, by which time the rainsshould have started, making large-scale campaigning impossible forseveral months.    We thus have time to deal with the more immediateproblems of Indo-China, which are political and not military.    In thecircumstances, to proceed with the United States proposal in all hastebefore Geneva would impair the prospect of any successful negotiation atGeneva, and would be unacceptable to public opinion here.3. The fundamental weakness of the United States proposal isits assumption that the threat of retaliation against China would cause her to withdraw aid from the Vietminh.    There is a distinction between warningChina that some specified further action will entail retaliation, which mightbe an effective deterrent, and calling upon her to desist from action inwhich she is already engaged.    It is hard to see what threat would be suffiently potent to make China swallow so humiliating a rebuff as theabandonment of the Vietminh without any face-saving concession in return.1-
4.        If I am right in this view, the joint warning to China wouldhave no effect and the coalition would then have to withdrawignominiously or else embark on warlike action against China.Neither blockade nor the bombing of China&apos;s internal and externalcommunications, which the United States Government appear to have in mind, were considered by our Chiefs of Staff to be militarilyeffective when these were discussed in connection with Korea.    Theywould, however, give China every excuse for invoking the Sino/soviet treaty and might thus lead to a world war.    Nor should we commitBritish forces to operations in Indo-China,5,        The time to consider a warning to China may come later.If, for instance, a negotiated settlement of the Indo-China problem wereto be reached at Geneva, possibly on a basis of partition, a warning to china that further Communist encroachment in Indo-China would entail retaliation, and possibly even war, would be far more likelyboth to deter China and to be acceptable to British (and French) publicopinion.6.        It does not seem that the Americans have yet formed anyclear conception of the military operations which they propose shouldbe conducted against China if threats fail to produce the desired result.Nor have they weighed the consequences of this policy.    On the otherhand the proposal to organise collective security in South-East Asiais in itself attractive; and there is advantage in expressing our views to the Americans whilst their ideas are still not fully formed.Consequently, subject to the agreement of my colleagues myinclination is to take advantage of President Eisenhower&apos;s suggestion to the Prime Minister and invite Mir. Dulles to visit London next week in order to discuss this problem with him.    Meanwhile I would proposeto inform the Governments of France, Australia, Canada andNew Zealand of the views set out above.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.6th April, 1954.
