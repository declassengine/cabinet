Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1954SECRET ncpiPF        Copy No.    gC. (54) 118 RECORD COPYMarc/?, 7954CABINETEUROPEAN PAYMENTS union memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate for the information of my colleagues the text of a message whichI have recently sent to all Commonwealth Finance Ministers about the european payments Union.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,29th March, 1954.Message to Commonwealth Finance ministers am sending you this message in order to let you know how our minds are working on the current problems relating to the European Payments Union(E.P.U.).2. In the first place, I regard is as a major objective of policy to maintainthe E.P.U. for another year. Although we are trying to move forward to a widersystem of trade and payments, we cannot yet dispense with this regional system,particularly at a time when the economic outlook in the United States is souncertain and when it is most important that the liberalisation of European trade should continue.3. I had hoped, as you know, that the E.P.U. could be continued in verymuch its present form. But the system has come under severe strains and stressesas the result of the emergence of extreme creditor and debtor positions; theproblem of the German surpluses is particularly acute. The German quota inE.P.U. is $500 millions, but it is estimated that by the end of June, i.e., even beforethe beginning of the next E.P.U. year, she will have an accumulated surplus of$1,100 millions, and that, in the absence of any change of policy on her part, shewill continue to run surpluses with the E.P.U., though at a rather lower rate.Belgium, Holland and Switzerland are also likely to continue in surplus. On theother side we expect, as you know, that the sterling area will fall into deficit withthe E.P.U. in the course of this year; and I can see little chance of any earlyreversal of the deficit position of France. All this inevitably distorts the E.P.U.pattern and makes it more difficult for the system to work in the way originally intended, i.e., through the maintenance by each member of a broad equilibriumwith the other members as a group. This of course implied the ultimate settlementof debts through trade, not through gold payments.4. The response of the creditor countries to this situation is to demand that provision should be made for the repayment, by instalments over three years, ofE.P.U. debts that have been outstanding for more than eighteen months, and also for a higher proportion of gold to be paid to them in respect of their current andfuture surpluses. Their view, in short, is that the debtor countries should take45947
Mthe whole burden of adjustment and that the E.P.U. should be put increasinglyon to a gold settlement basis. This is a proposition which I regard as completelyunacceptable. In our own case, it would mean a liability to repay our E.P.U.debt at the rate of  60 millions a year in gold, with no additional opportunityprovided for paying off the debt through trade.&apos; 5. The position which we have taken hitherto has been to insist on the primary importance of expanding trade in Europe and, to that end, of minimisingthe need for settlements in gold. When we liberalised our imports from Europelast October to the extent of 75 per cent, we emphasised to the Council of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation that we were taking a sub-stantial risk for our balance of payments, and that we could not at the same timecontemplate any additional financial burden in the E.P.U. We have been supported in our view that the E.P.U. should continue unchanged by the Scandinavian-navians, but strongly opposed by Germany, Benelux and Switzerland; Italy andFrance have tended to favour some concession to the creditors. We are criticised-however unfairly for talking about convertibility but refusing to pay our debts.6. In these circumstances I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion thata policy of continuing the E.P.U. without any substantial change is no longerpracticable. Moreover, it is, of course, relevant that our debt to the E.P.U. hasto be paid off sooner or later; in the event of the E.P.U. being liquidated (e.g., in conditions of convertibility) any outstanding debts have to be repaid over threeyears from the date of liquidation. It is not the principle of repayment with whichwe quarrel, but the method proposed by the creditor countries; the important thing, as it seems to us, is to ensure that there is the largest possible opportunityfor repaying the debt by the normal processes of trade.. There is, moreover, thepoint that in so far as we repay old debt we reconstitute our line of credit in theUnion, and this will be useful if, as we expect, we run further into deficit.7. While, therefore, I am certainly not prepared to accept all the demandsput forward by the creditors, I think that some measure of compromise is necessary if there is to be an agreed plan for continuing the E.P.U. What is needed, as i see it, is a combined operation in which creditors as well as debtors play their part and accept their share of the responsibility for creating the conditions forthe continuation of the E.P.U. The objective would be to create opportunities foran expansion of trade in Europe and for the correction of extreme creditor anddebtor positions by trade rather than by settlements in gold.8. The creditor countries, and I am thinking particularly of Germany, must take appropriate measures, both externally and internally, to reduce the strain on the Union which is caused by their surpluses: they must, in short, follow&quot; good creditor &quot; policies in Europe. There are various possibilities here, e.g.,further liberalisation, a reduction of tariffs, internal expansion, and in the caseof Germany it is obviously sensible, if the difficulties can be overcome, to arrangefor the acceleration of her own debt payments to us and other countries.9. If the creditor countries do this, then there would, I think, be a case forsome at least of the debtor countries to make a contribution; and for my part Iwould be prepared, though only as part of a satisfactory general plan, to con-template some additional charge on the reserves this year in respect of the repayment of our outstanding debt to the Union. I have not come to any finalview as to the amount, or method, of any such repayment, though it wouldcertainly be on a more limited scale than the creditors have proposed. The precisecommitment which would be appropriate cannot be judged till we see how far the other countries are prepared to play their part in the sort of combined operation which I have indicated. I am not at all disposed to make a concessionmerely in the hope that others will follow our lead; any concession must be partof a general plan for keeping the E.P.U. going and must be matched by appropriate action on the part of the creditors.10. I hope you will agree that this plan represents a sensible balance betweenthe need to safeguard the reserves and our responsibility for making some con-tribution to ease the strains on the E.P.U. We shall be developing these ideasin the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation in the near future, andI will keep you informed of the outcome.I am sending a similar message to the other Commonwealth Finance Ministers.25 th March, 1954.
