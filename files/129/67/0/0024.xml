Printed for the Cabinet.   April .1954CONFIDENTIALCABINET office record copy copy No. g 5C. (54) 1242nd April, 1954CABINETTREATMENT OF BRITISH FIRMS IN CHINA&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Prime-Minister-stated in the House of Commons on 25th February thatwe could not relax restrictions on trade with China until a Korean or, perhaps, a wider Far Eastern peace had been established. But he hoped that the Conferenceat Geneva would open the road to that prospect. This policy was reiterated in the debate in- the: House on East-West Trade on 22nd March and on the same day, in; reply, to a Question, I stated that we- hoped that the Geneva Conference would open the way for o. reconsideration of the, strategic embargo on trade with China.&quot;2. The Chinese &quot;Governmenfs treatment of British firms in China is, ofcourse, a relevant&apos;factor in !this arid my colleagues, may like to have some specificexamples of the treatment suffered, by British firms. Some typical..cases are. given&apos; in the annex to the memorandum. Publicity has not been given, to these casesbecause the individual firms involved feared that it would react unfavourably ontheir people who are still held in China.3. . Since we have already recognised -the. Chinese. communist government,we have few cards in our hands;at Geneva. . The value to the Chinese of trade with/us may be one of.them.r (!a)&apos;j)HongTKong and1Shanghai-Bank&quot;After the establishment, of .the..communist government:..in.- 1949. the: bank; found it necessary to-restrict the scope of its operations in. China, and to elose .i.ts\ branches outside Shanghai. &apos; Jt.tapplied to close its branch,in. SwatowJn .1950 and&apos; asked-that, its foreign manager-should either permitted .to Jeave China pr Jphrjjieoffice in Shanghai. ^Permission,.to.close the.Office arid. transfer its&apos;;iiabilities,v&quot;to&apos; Shanghai&apos; was oijly granted at &quot;the beginning, &quot;of: .1953. ; The i manager. has only, just received permission to&apos; leave Swatbw.  He had to wait for his exit perrriit foralmost four years.The bank applied to close its branches in Peking and Tientsin in September1951. An application was made to close the Shanghai office itself in August 1953.No progress whatever was made until December 1953 and the bank had to main-tain its full staff of foreigners and Chinese although they were doing nothing.Progress was made last December only after the bank refused to remit furtherfunds unless it was able to dismiss staff. Only then was it able to get rid of anumber of Chinese in Peking and Shanghai and only then did the Chinese agree a. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,. 2nd April, 1954.-ANNEX45994
to consider negotiating to take over the bank. The bank&apos;s assets in China are verylarge and far outweigh their liabilities. Nevertheless, in order to get their foreignstaff out of jeopardy and to stop a continuing drain upon them, the bank considerthat they can only write everything off. There are about twelve foreignersinvolved.Numerous representations have been made by Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy at peking on behalf of the bank with no effect.(b) British-American Tobacco CompanyThis was one of the largest tobacco manufacturing concerns in China. TheChinese made it practically impossible for this company to sell its products. Theynevertheless forbade it to reduce staff or to sell any of its stocks of raw materials and supplies in order to meet its obligations in the way of wages. At the sametime they imposed arbitrary and very heavy tax demands, which the company was unable to meet. As a result the company in the summer of 1952, in fear lest theirmanagers should be put in gaol, offered the Chinese the whole of their factories,machinery, stocks, &amp;c, provided the Chinese also took over the liabilities of thecompany, which were grossly inflated. In spite of this arrangement, six of the staff are still, nearly two years later, held in China on the pretext that there are certainclaims outstanding from disgruntled employees which need to be settled by thecourts.(c) Ewo Brewery Company (Jardine, Matheson and Company)Owing to an austerity campaign in the spring of 1952, this company&apos;s salesfell off sharply. It ran out of ready cash to pay its employees. But it had large stocks of malt, beer, botties, &amp;c, which were worth a large sum of money. TheChinese banks were forbidden to advance money against these stocks so that it wasimpossible for the company to raise funds. The manager was then thrown intogaol. Eventually, another British firm was able to provide some money and the manager was able to get out. But the firm was forced to close down and Jardine,Mathesons have handed it over lock, stock and barrel to the Chinese.(d) Pawns and BaldwinsThis firm of wool spinners has a plant in Shanghai which has continued to operate. It has made profits over the last few years, but has not been allowed toremit any of them. The firm was refused permission to send in a replacement fortheir manager, who has been in China for many years and when last year they found a local British subject willing to take over the management and enable theirman to leave, permission was refused by the Chinese for the change.2. These cases are only four among many dozens. They are typical and show the pattern. By refusing exit permits and replacements, by refusing credit,by refusing permission for firms to sell their assets, by imposing exorbitant taxdemands without warning and demanding payment at a week&apos;s notice, and even by refusing to permit Chinese companies to meet their obligations to British firms, theChinese authorities have forced the latter out of business. The property of anumber of British companies has been requisitioned outright, including the shell company and the British Utilities in Shanghai. Representations by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have had no apparent effect. It is, of course, Communist policyeventually to eliminate all private enterprises whether foreign or Chinese. But inthe case of British and other foreign firms in China, the notable thing is that having reduced firms to the last gasp they have not driven them out at once, but have held them in China in a state of suspense. It is impossible to determine why they act thus: it may be in retaliation for the strategic trade embargo, it may be out of a desire to hold Western hostages or to demonstrate their power.
