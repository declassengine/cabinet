TRIESTEMemorandnm by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsAttempts during October, November and December to bring abouta Five-Power Conference on Trieste having failed, secret tripartite Anglo-American-Yugoslav talks have been taking place in London since earlyFebruary, with Italian acquiescence, with the object of finding a realisticbasis for bringing about an agreed settlement between Italy and Yugoslavia.2..       After some ten weeks of discussion, the Yugoslavs are on the vergeof agreeing in principle to a territorial solution approximating, with certainfrontier adjustments, to the division of the Free Territory along the zonalboundary, provided they can get satisfaction on a number of Conditions&quot;which they have put forward.    If we can reduce these &quot;conditions&quot; to reasonable proportions, the next step will be to embark on similar tripartitetalks with the Italians.3.        The Italians will no doubt be disappointed at not getting back someof the Italian villages in Zone B.    But as they accepted the Anglo-American&quot;decision&quot; of 8th October, 1953, which prescribed a division of the free territory along the zonal boundary, it will be difficult for them to reject the territorial provisions worked out with the Yugoslavs.    It may not,however, be easy to get them to accept some of the Yugoslav &quot;conditions&quot;and they themselves are likely to put forward counter-conditions.    Whiletherefore the outlook is not unpromising, the extent to which prestige andemotions are engaged on each side makes it unwise to be unduly optimisticabout a successful outcome.4.        I do not wish to burden my colleagues at this stage with details ofthe Yugoslav conditions, but I must invite their attention to one of them.It is that, in return for the abandonment by the Yugoslavs of their claimto the City and Port of Trieste with all its valuable installations, theItalians should finance for the Yugoslavs the construction of a new portin Zone B at San Nicola (on the south side of the Muggia peninsula) and ofa new railway line linking it with one of the existing lines in the interior.It is quite certain that the Italians, who will be expected, as one of theother conditions, to settle financial issues outstanding between the twocountries at a possible cost to themselves of some $40 or $50 millions,would be neither able nor willing to contribute to this venture.    On theother hand, the Yugoslavs, who are in serious financial straits, have made it an essential element in any settlement.    The Americans have accordinglyindicated that they are themselves prepared to find $20 millions in thecurrent fiscal year, in the form of additional economic aid, towards theconstruction of the new railway.    They have made it clear that it would be helpful in Washington if, as a token of solidarity, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould also find a small sum in sterling.* SECRET,  x CABINET OFFICE M ^41145 RECORD COPY        copy no. 6/12th April, 1954CABINET
5,        Despite our own financial problems, I would ask my colleagues toagree to a small United Kingdom grant to supplement the sum which isbeing provided by the United States Government.    It would of course becontingent on agreement being reached between the Italians and Yugoslavson a solution of the Trieste problem.    My reasons are the fcllowing:-(i)     A settlement of this problem would not only release us froman embarrassing international situation but would, I hope,lead on to a raprochement between Italy and yugoslavia and to the development of a co-ordinated defence effort inthe Adriatic,    It is therefore greatly to our interest tobring about a settlement.(ii)     Allied Military Government in Zone A has for some eight years now been a joint Anglo-American responsibility,with a certain United Kingdom predominance in that wehave always provided the Military Governor.    It would look a little shabby fbz&apos; us now to leave the Americans tofoot the whole bilL    A relatively small contribution would satisfy them.(iii) A solution of the Trieste problem would enable us towithdraw our garrison and so effect a considerableannual saving.6.        If my colleagues agree, as I hope they will, to a United Kingdomgrant as part of a settlement, if one is reached, the extension for one moreyear of economic aid to Yugoslavia, due to end in June, 1954, might furnish the most convenient cover.    The sum I have in mind is  2 millions.A.E.Foreign Office, S. &quot;W&quot;. 1.12th April, 1954,
