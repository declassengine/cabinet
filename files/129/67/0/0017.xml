BtHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ^|The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use oi....dl^.0^Yy&gt;^^..f^^^^?TOP SECRET C0py n00.(54) 117 H29TH MARCH, 1954I CABINETSIAMAND THE DEFENCE OF MALAYA??^?1 Memorandum by the Secretary of State F^HBB^bI fo^ Foreign AffairsI As some of my colleagues are already aware, plans existf^H for the landward defence of Malaya in two distinct contingencies: ff^J(a) actual warlike invasion or (b) a threat of invasion developing aftera Communist seizure of power in Siam.    Both plans involve theoccupation by British forces of the Songkhla position, situated on Siamesef^^| territory to the North of the Siamese/Malayan frontier on the Xra P^HIsthmus.    This position would be much more easily defended than theexisting frontier.    This paper deals only with the plan, known asRINGLET, for dealing with the situation in (b), which is thought to be amore likely source of danger than warlike invasion (resistance to which P^Hwould, in any case, be mainly a military problem).    This operationwould be carried out by the troops normally stationed in Malaya. Inthe opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, it might have to be implemented, even,if need be, without prior notification to the Siamese Government, as soonas it became clear that a threat to Malaya had developed following aCommunist seizure of power in Siam.    RINGLET would thus involveBritish invasion of Siamese territory in time of peace.2. The military and political repercussions of RINGLET, whichhave recently been examined by the Foreign Office in conjunction with theChiefs of Staff, would be serious.  Seizure of the Songkhla position, thoughit would not necessarily of itself provoke war with China, could easily berepresented, both at home and abroad, as aggression against Siam.    If theH operation had to be carried out before a strategic reserve had been formedf^H in the United Kingdom, the need to replace in Malaya the troops takingI part would present a problem.3. I accordingly share the view expressed by the Chiefs of Staff,that every possible measure should be taken to stiffen resistance to faHCommunism in Siam in order to avoid any necessity for this operation.Such measures should not include any form of military guarantee to Siam.Not only would it be militarily impracticable to defend Siam againstinvasion, but this is a less likely danger than the subversion of Siam to r^HCommunist purposes by a gradual process of infiltration, threats andblandishment.    The need is rather/to strengthen Siam&apos;s own armed forces,to safeguard her economic prosperity and to help ensure the continuedpro-Western attitude of her rulers.4. Much is already being done in this field, particularly by theUnitedS tates, who are giving the Siamese both military and economic aidon a substantial scale and enjoy considerable influence with the SiameseGovernment.    However, the menacing situation in Indo-China and the faHB^bI -1-
probability that Communism will strengthen its hold in that country, make ^^^H[ an increased effort in Siam most urgent.    The first step, in view of the ^^^JL part already played by the United States, should be to secure Anglo-American agreement on the measures to be taken.    I would accordinglyI propose to initiate, if possible before the Geneva Conference discussions ^^^Hon Indo-China, politico-military talks with the United States Government ^^^flI on means of stiffening Siamese resistance to Communism. ^^^J5. The topics for discussion with the United States Government[ might include:-(a) means of encouraging the Siamese toincrease the size and efficiency oftheir armed forces; ^^^H(b) extension of the existing liaison and co-operation between the Siamese and ^^^HBritish asc-med forces;I (c) measures to avoid the disruption of theSiamese economy that would result from ^^^Han undue fall in Siamese revenue fromexports;I (d) closer liaison between the SiameseGovernment and Western diplomatic ^^^Hrepresentatives;(a)  fostering of international support for ^^^H[ the preservation of Siamese independence;(f) promotion of closer Siamese relations withneighbouring countries in South-East Asia.I 6. In order to persuade the United States Government of theneed for a co-ordinated effort in Siam on the above lines, I would propose,subject to the views of my colleagues, to inform them of the views of theChiefs of Staff regarding the military action that would be required tosafeguard Malaya in the circumstances envisaged in paragraph 1,I Foreign Office, S.W.I.,I 29TH MARCH, 1954.
