(54) 137 CABINET OFFICE8th April, 1954 RECORD COPYCABINETEGYPT:   CONCENTRATION  AND   CONTRACTION   OF  the canal ZONE BASEMemorandum by the Minister of defence i was invited by the Cabinet on 22nd March to report what initial steps couldbe taken to concentrate and contract the Base in the Canal Zone, and to recommend the phases of re-deployment which could be carried out in parallel with thiscontraction (C.C. (54) 21st Conclusions, Minute 2).2. In present circumstances, it is necessary to plan on the assumption that either of two possible courses may have to be followed:-(a) that agreement will in due course be reached with Egypt on the with-drawal of British forces and on running the Base thereafter withService technicians or by civilian contracts; or(b) that no agreement will be reached with Egypt and that we must beprepared to maintain indefinitely in the Canal Zone a garrison ofapproximately 15,000, as described in C. (54) 74.3. These two alternatives are divergent almost from the start, since underalternative (a) the intention would be to maintain all the installations and storesrequired for the functioning of the Base irrespective of their location, whereasunder alternative (b) the intention would be to withdraw within a defensible peri-meter and to abandon all the installations outside it. There is, therefore, littleaction that is common to both alternatives and no substantial concentration orcontraction of the Base is possible until it has been definitely decided whichalternative to adopt. The following measures can, however, be taken without prejudicing this decision;Stores4. Certain stores which we now estimate will be surplus to requirements inEgypt under either alternative can be removed, making possible some slightreductions in the perimeters to be guarded. No reliable estimate of quantities canbe made without consultation with Middle East but it is unlikely that theywould be very large.Headquarters5. The Cabinet have already approved in principle the move of G.H.Q.,Middle East and H.Q., Middle East Air Forces to Cyprus (C.C. (54) 5th Conclusions,Minute 6). In agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer I have authorisedcertain works services in Cyprus which will enable this move to start in the autumn46019
of this year and to be completed about July, 1955. There are the following great advantages in an early move: (a) The G.O.C. British Troops in Egypt would be relieved of responsibilityfor guarding the Headquarters, their staffs and communications;(b) the Commanders-in-Chief, in Cyprus, would not be involved in the day-to-day tension in the Canal Zone and would be freer to consider their. - wider responsibilities in the Middle East as a whole.6. However, if preparations are to be made for the move to begin in theautumn there are bound to be leakages. I recommend, therefore, that an early announcement of our intentions should be made.Royal Air Force Units7. Certain Air Force Units can be disbanded or redeployed. These would include the removal of two all-weather fighter squadrons and a photographic reconnaissance squadron and the closing down of two airfields, at Shallufa andKabrit. These moves, which would reduce the number of R.A.F. personnel in the zone by about 2,000 could be completed at various dates up to 12 months from theorder being given.Troops for Operation RODEO8. The Chiefs of Staff have in D. (54) 19 proposed to the Defence Committeea reconsideration of the practicability of present plans for operation RODEO(the occupation of Cairo and Alexandria for the protection of the Britishpopulation). If it is agreed that we should, in future, plan only for more limitedrescue operations, some reduction of fighting troops in the Canal Zone could,subject to the views of the Foreign Secretary, be effected.Conclusion (Lo^Ji^ r9.   I therefore ask the Council(a) to agree that the Commanders-in-Chief be instructed forthwith to removeor to dispose of all stores that will not be required in the Canal Zoneunder either alternative (a) or (b) in paragraph 2 above;, (b) to approve an early announcement that the Headquarters of the.Com-manders-iri-Chief, Middle East, will be transferred to Cyprus as soonas practicable; -(c) to agree that, subject to the views of the Commanders-in-Chief, middle east, the withdrawal or disbandment of certain R.A.F. units should beauthorised where this will not prejudice either of the future courses of action described in paragraph 2;(d) to note that, subject to reconsideration of plans for operation RODEO,some contraction of the numbers of fighting troops in the Canal Zonemay be possible./     &apos; &apos; &apos; -   - AMinistry of Defence, S.W. 1,7th April, 1954.
