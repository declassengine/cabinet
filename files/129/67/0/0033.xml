(THIS DOCUlvffiNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER MAJESTY !S BRITANNIC GOVERNMENT)secret cabinet office record copy .(54) 133COPY NO. f^f6th April, 1954CABINETUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THE EUROPEANGOAD AND STEEL community memorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues have before them papers by the Minister of Supply(C. (54) 131) and the Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (54) 126) upon thissubject.    I wish to draw attention to the fundamental issue of commercial policy which is associated with these problems.2.        The real issue which we have to decide is whether we should seek the establishment of a common market in steel between the United Kingdomand the Community as recommended to us in the report attached to C. (54) 20oIt is important that we should understand clearly and from the outset justwhat this involves.    It would mean that we should come to an agreement toestablish a free trade area - that is, an area without tariffs or quotas -embracing the United Kingdom and the Schuman Community for all trade between us in steel.    We should treat European countries who are membersof the Community on a different basis from all other foreign countries in theworld with regard to imports of steel.    There are arguments for and againsta common market of this character but, whatever else can be said about it,it would certainly be a new and dramatic initiative in the whole history andevolution of our commercial policy.3.        If we decided that this was the kind of situation which we wanted to create, it would be necessary to approach the matter in two stages.First, we should have negotiations with the Schuman Community on thebasis of creating a free trade area and covering the points, or some of thepoints, mentioned in M. monnet  letter - C. (54) 20, Appendix A.    Secondly ^and not less important, we should have to defend to the other nations of theworld the resultant agreement upon the basis that it represented a form of limited Customs Union.    On such a basis we should have to seek the agree-ment of the parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T0)to permit us to discriminate in favour of our partners in the SchumanCommunity against all other foreign countries in the G.A.T.T,&apos;4.        The effect of such a policy here upon our power to influence thedevelopment of production and trade in the field of steel or, if it were included in the Community, of coal, would be substantial.    It would subject the steel industry to substantial competition from their Europeancompetitors inside the United Kingdom market.    Essentially, we shouldhave created a free trade area in which physical control of trade was largely eliminated but over which we would have, of course, no control asto fiscal, monetary or social policy.1-
5.        Opinions may vary as to whether we should seek a solution of thiskind to the problem or, if we did seek it, the details of the form it was totake.    I am clear, however, that the British Government must decide beforetalks open whether we wish to pursue this policy or not.    To start off onsuch a policy, and then to waver or to be pushed out of it by opposition either from the Miners&apos; Union or from the Steel Board, would be to have the worst of all possible worlds.6.        If we decide against a common market, discussions can still takeplace with M. Ivlonnet but upon an entirely different basis, namely, what should be the relation between our coal or steel industries with the SchumanCommunity, in order to improve commercial relationships upon the normalbasis of the most-favoured-nation principle,7,        The Cabinet decided on 21st January (C.C.(54) 4th Conclusions,Minute 2) that, if satisfactory progress were made in consultations with the steel and coal industries here and with the Commonwealth, explanatory discussions should be, opened with M. Monnet.    It is clear from thediscussions which have taken place that both the steel and coal industry are a very long way from supporting the idea of a common market as described above.    I suggest, therefore, that the next step should befor a group of Ministers, assisted by appropriate officials, to examinewhat our policy should be in the light of the reports we have from theMinister of Supply and the Minister of Fuel and Power, and of the commentsreceived from the Commonwealth Governments and to report to the Cabinettheir conclusions on the policy to be pursued.    I am convinced that it is better to face a short period of delay rather than to drift into talks withM. Monnet without any clear conception of where it is that we are trying to go.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.I.6th April, 1954.
