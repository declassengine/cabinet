-72o/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT )secret cabinet OFFICE ^ ^ili^ RECORD COPY COPY NO&apos;14th April, 1954CABINETSHELTER policy memorandum by the Minister of works the Defence Committee on 30th March, 1953 asked me to try andpersuade applicants for building licences for four-storey and higherbuildings to include in their plans a strengthened basement adequate foruse as an air-raid shelter.    I have no powers to compel a building ownerto do this.2.        Persuasion has succeeded in the majority of cases, but siiace the explosion on 1st March of the hydrogen bomb some owners do not think the extra expense is worth incurring.    The new buildings are needed and the licences ought to be given.     But when I grant them it is fairly certainthat the policy of persuasion will no longer be effective.3.        Accordingly, if it is still thought that strengthened basements are essential I must ask for compulsory powers.     It is unlikely that these couldbe obtained unless the Government agreed to make grants to cover the costof the shelters.    This might run into  10 millions a year, or even moreif flats are included.4.        The Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence considered thequestion on 12th April and thought that compulsory powers could not becontemplated.    As this would mean that the construction of shelters forthe public would more or less cease, I was asked to bring the matter tothe Cabinet.D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.13th April, 1954.
