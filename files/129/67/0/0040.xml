to India leaving the Commonwealth.    He also took the view that adeclaration of this kind made almost on the eve of the geneva conference might, in his own words, &quot;prove a very unpleasantboomerang&quot;,,His Excellency said that he would be leading theNew Zealand delegation to Geneva and would be grateful if he coulddiscuss the issues with us in advance.    I said that we would gladlyarrange to do so.7th April, 1954. READINGTELEGRAMSIAt their meeting this morning Cabinet discussed variousmessages received from Mr. Munro reporting on his discussions with Mr. Dulles and the latter&apos;s proposal for the formation of an ad hoc coalition to deal with the situation in Indo-China.    Thisproposal is of the greatest importance not only as it may affectIndo-China itself but because of its bearing on our future relationswith the United States.In a matter of such importance we would wish to have the closest consultation particularly with the United Kingdom and australia before any decision is taken and while in the time we havenot been able to examine in detail all the implications of the proposalwe set out below some of our preliminary reactions which we wouldbe glad if you would discuss with the United Kingdom and australian government.1.   It is of the first importance that there should be thehighest measure of agreement between the United Kingdom,Australia and New Zealand and we are encouraged to note that Mr. Dulles attaches the same importance to this aswe do,    Yire are conscious also of the substantial UnitedKingdom interests in the Far East and are anxious that whatever action may be taken in Indo-China should notinjure the Commonwealth in any way nor prejudice theinterests of the United Kingdom in the Far East or south East Asia.2.   All of our Governments have given consistent support to the United Nations since it was.launched and it wouldbe very difficult to carry Parliament and public opinion in this country on any actions which did not have asatisfactory United Nations and international backing.We do not minimise the difficulties either from theviewpoint of the French or of the United Nations in achieving such a basis but we feel that the attempt toobtain this must be made if Governments are to securethe support they require in their own countries and enablethem also to attract that measure of international support which would be necessary for the success of intervention of the kind now proposed by the United States,
3.   In the past the French have been opposed to UnitedStates or other allied intervention in Indo-China,    Itseems that it would be essential to the success of theUnited States proposal that the French accept it.In the absence of information as to the views of theFrench Government it is difficult for the rest of us tomake a full and adequate appreciation of the position,4.   It seems safe to assume that the military assistance given by the United States to Indo-China will continue insuch measure as may be needed.    Whether however thiswill be effective without allied intervention is moredifficult to say but on this point we think it important tohave some appreciation of the views of the FrenchGo ve r nme nt.5.   The political aspects of the situation in Indo-Chinaappear to us to be of paramount importance.    We are not aware how far  or how fast the French will proceed withthe grant of full independence and self-government to the associated States of Indo-China nor whether - and this ofcourse is affected by the military situation - assuming that independence is granted there will be a sufficientbasis of support in the States for the formation of governments not under Communist influence.6.   Although it is stated that naval and air forces only would be required at the present time it seems almost certain - bearing in mind experience in Korea - that land forces would be sought.   We would have the greatest difficulty in finding such forces;  more so while the korean force - which under the terms of enlistmentcannot be employed elsewhere - continues in being.7.   Armed intervention in Indo-China may lead toinvolvement with China and possibly even - notwithstandingMr. Dulles&apos; estimate - with the Soviet Union itself.This risk was contained in Korea but in the case of Indo-China it seems more doubtful whether it would be possibleto avoid conflict with China.8.   In our preliminary thinking on this problem we have given some consideration to the probable views of the countries inSouth East Asia.   Although Thailand may support the UnitedStates proposal it is probable that other Governmentsincluding India may prove hostile and this situation may welldo damage to our future relations with these countries.9.     On the other hand we cannot be insensible of the greatimportance of holding Indo-China.    If.it should fall toCommunism it would not be long before neighbouring countriesin the region were penetrated and their Governments subverted.We could expect that if this occurred Japan might align herselfwith the Communists - possibly on a basis of &quot;neutralism&quot;.This would gravely upset the balance of power in this part ofthe world.    Moreover the loss of Indo-China would pose amenacing threat to the security of Australia and New zealand and, although it may be unlikely at least in the immediate futurethat we would be attacked, our eventual position would be farfrom secure .
IT5!10.    These are some of the important elements of the problem as we see it and while we shall continue our examination of theproposal, we would be glad to have at the earliest possible moment an indication of the views of the United Kingdom and australian Governments and their appreciation of thesituation.IIThe implications of the proposal now put forward obviouslyrequire the most careful and serious, consideration   by the Government.One of the questions of the very greatest concern to us is the absolutenecessity to preserve Anglo-American solidarity, and we are glad tosee the importance which the United States attaches to it0    We are nowdiscussing ways and means of obtaining the closest consultation with theBritish and Australians on any course of action that may be taken.2.        Another aspect which will weigh with public here as elsewhereas it does now with Ministers is the absence of any United Nations cover for the proposed course of action.    While we appreciate the impracticable-ability at present of securing this backing the grave consequences of by-passing the United Nations and especially in relation to public opinioncannot fail to be disturbing.    It seems essential also that an invitationfor assistance should come from the French.3.        We note that the Americans believe that in the first instancethere will be no need for additional land forces and that assistance wouldbe limited to naval and air contributions.    The Korean precedent (wherenaval and air action was followed up almost immediately by the use of ground forces) suggests, however, that it will not be long before there willbe a call for land contingents in any action to be taken in Indo-China,We should be glad to have your views on this possibility.4.        You will, of course, be informed immediately of all developmentshere and of the results of consultations with the United Kingdom and australia.
