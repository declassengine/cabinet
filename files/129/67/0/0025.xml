\tJ-5ECRET CABINET office.(54) 125 RECORD COPY        copy no.-3RD april, 1954.CABINETEXPENSES OF MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited by the Cabinet to circulate a paper on theexpenses of Members (C,C.(54) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3).2.        We have promised a statement in the House before Easter, andI attach, as Annex A, a draft of the lines which such a statement might follow.3.       At Annex 3 I give details of two possible plans for theconsideration of my colleagues.    Neither is perfect: each shows thestrength and weakness of any solution of this difficult problem,4.        Plan I is a scheme for paying tax-free subsistence expenses to members who necessarily incur extra living expenses by reason oftheir Parliamentary duties.    Not all Members do this, so not all would benefit.    I think the plan could be made to work, though there are plenty of difficulties about it.    It may be felt to be a defect that it would do nothing for London Members and very little for the Member who lives inthe neighbourhood of London and manages to go home virtually everynight.    My colleagues will wish to consider whether the principlebehind this plan is satisfactory, and whether it could stand alone as asufficient solution in itself.5.        I should point out that the suggested rate of 42/- is related toextra expenses over 24 hours.    Though the London Member is not away from his base for 24 hours he does, by reason of Parliamentary duty,incur some extra subsistence expenses which a man in an ordinaryoccupation does not - e. g. dinner away from home.    It might thereforebe possible logically to justify some more modest allowance even for london Members.6.        Plan II is a variation of the plan which I previously put to theCabinet in C. (54) 96.7.        My colleagues will see that Plan I deals only with extra livingexpenses, while Plan II deals with classes of expense other than extraliving expenses.    Logically, therefore, the two could be combined: butin practice the combination of the two would probably be thought toofavourable.8.       I should be glad to know which plan, or combination of plans,would, in my colleagues&apos; view, better repay further elaboration.r.a.b.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.2ND APRIL, 1954.
ANNEX ADRAFT PARLIAMENTARY statement the Government have&quot; given preliminary consideration to theReport of the Select Committee on Members1 Expenses.    The House will wish me to express on its behalf our gratitude to our colleagues on that committee for the careful work they did in establishing the facts of thesituation.The remuneration of Members of Parliament is not a matter onwhich the Government can or should take undivided responsibility.   It is essentially a House of Commons matter, in which a wide measure ofagreement between the Parties is desirable, for it is the well-being andreputation of the House of Commons as a whole which are involved, notthe administrative record of the Government in power.    It is also important to take account of informed public opinion, and for that reasonwe should be well-advised not to proceed too precipitately.Nevertheless, the House will expect the Government to give some general guidance.    We have formed the definite view that it wouldnot be right to proceed in the particular manner recommended by theSelect Committee, that is, to increase the Parliamentary salary from 1,000 to  1,500 and to institute a non-contributory pension scheme.In particular, the Government consider that the justification cited by theCommittee for their recommendation on salary, that is, that  1,500represents to-day roughly the same value as  1,000 in 1946, is whollyuna c ce ptab le.But there is no doubt that a number of hon. Members are in realfinancial difficulty because, in the great majority of cases, heavy and necessary expenses bite deeply into the Parliamentary salary of  1,000,and leave very little for the ordinary support of the Member himself andhis family.    That little can be very rightly and properly supplemented byearnings from other activities and in some cases by private means, but no Member ought to be forced by his private circumstances to economiseon Parliamentary expenses to an extent which is undesirable in the publicinterest.The Government take the view that what is wrong is not so much that the salary is insufficient as that too much of it is swallowed up ininescapable expenses.    They therefore think that the House would be welljustified in considering alternative methods of easing the undoubteddifficulties of hon. Members.    Almost any alternative proposal is boundto have difficulties of its own, and the Government would not wish to forma definite opinion about detailed schemes without first having theadvantage of the opinions and constructive suggestions of hon. members in all parts of the House, expressed in open debate.    There would alsono doubt have to be more detailed consultations in order to work out thedetails of any scheme which commanded general approval.One possibility which the Government have in mind is a schemeof subsistence allowances, the principle of which would be that areasonable contribution should be made towards those extra living costs which are necessarily incurred by an hon. Member by reason of his parliamentary duties.    Such a scheme presents many difficulties of detail on which the Government would wish to take the sense of the House.
V/e need not rule out of consideration further assistance in kind.    Possible examples are telephone calls, postage, and perhapssecretarial assistance, though they have all been considered before, andthere are difficulties about all of them.In the Governments view, the most convenient next step wouldbe a general debate which they hope can be arranged through the usual channels shortly after Easter.ANNEX BPLAN IThe PrincipleThis is a plan for giving night subsistence allowances.   It is designed in principle to reimburse extra subsistence expenses which are actually incurred and in which the M.P. is involved by reason of his duties as such.These extra expenses are caused (though not in all cases) bythe special circumstances that the M.P.&apos;s job requires his attendancein two places - London and his constituency.    In order to give thatattendance he either has to maintain two homes or has to spend manynights in a club, hotel or the like, at extra cost.The QuantumThere should clearly be a flat rate of allowance, and an appropriate amount might be 42/- a night.This should presumably be authorised by a Resolution of theHouse of Commons.    Just how the Resolution should be framed - e. g.whether it should permit of later variation of the amount without afresh Resolution - would be a point for consideration.Suggested ConditionsA,   Members for Constituencies outside London(1)  If the Member has a home outside London he would be eligible for the allowance for every night spent in London (even if he also has a home in London) by reason of his Parliamentary duties:provided that he does not at the same time claim tax relief in respectof the additional cost of living in his constituency.(2)  If the Member maintains only one home, and that home isin London,(a) he would not be eligible for the allowance in respectof nights spent in London; but(b) he would be eligible for the allowance in respectof nights spent in his constituency in pursuanceof his duties as an M.P.
B.  Members for London Constituencies(3)  No Member for a London constituency would be eligiblefor the allowance.   f\i. such a Member lives in London, he is put tono extra night subsistence expenses:  if he Hves elsewhere, then - whetheror not he also maintains a home in London - that is his own affair.    the extra expense is not forced on him by his duties as an M.P.    He may(like others) need relief^in respect of other expenses, but that would notbe part of this scheme /.Notes and points of difficulty 11.        When a Member spends a night away from home he may oftenspend it with friends or relations, or at a place provided by his TradeUnion or employer, and incur little or no extra cost.    One would notenquire into this.2.        It would be necessary to define London, both for the purposes of deciding which were London constituencies and which were London homes.The present Revenue practice is to define London as including only themetropolitan boroughs.    Unsuccessful attempts have been made from timeto time to get agreement through the Whips for a wider definition.Something wider would be reasonable and perhaps essential for thisscheme - and the same definition should be used for this purpose andInland Revenue purposes.    There would be some anomalies.    one possibility would be to take a circle with, say, a twelve-mile radius fromBig Ben.    All constituencies within the circle or through which the circlepasses would then be regarded as in London.3.       As at present set out, the scheme would give a London allowance to numbers of Members who would live (at least partly) in London anyhowfor other purposes, and who lived there before ever they became Members.A man of means who has always maintained a house both in London andone in,the country, and who expects always to continue to do so, would still be eligible for London subsistence while a Member.    This is some-what anomalous.    But it is not easy to see how one can segregate those members who live in London solely because they are Members and thosewho would live there whether they were Members or not.    One possibletest, however, might be residence in London before election - andeligibility might be refused to all except those who began to live in Londonwhen they became Members.    But the Inland Revenue do not attempt anysuch distinction.4.        The London allowance should perhaps be paid only duringsessions, or at any rate only when a Member is in London, even in arecess, for the service of the House (e. g. to attend a Select Committee).5. The allowances would of course be tax-free, and if a Membercould show that his extra living expenses exceeded the total allowancereceived, he would be able to claim the excess for tax relief on his salary.6.        To pay a London subsistence allowance to Ministers whoseofficial duties are primarily discharged in London might seem repugnantto good sense.    Yet there is no obvious reason why Ministers in the commons should not, in their M.P. capacity, benefit from a schemedesigned to meet special M.P. expenditure.
Ii2The best course might be to leave Senior Ministers aside forthe moment.and to pay the subsistence allowance to a Junior minister who sits for a non-London constituency when he visits his constituencyin his capacity as a Member, except when in doing so he stays at home,either in or near his constituency.    But it must be recognised that thebenefit to such Ministers would almost certainly be a good deal smaller than that which back-benchers would derive, and such a plan would hardly diminish at all the very strong case which exists for improving the position of all Junior Ministers by allowing them to draw the wholeof their Parliamentary salaries (instead of only half) in addition to theirMinisterial salaries.    This would need legislation.Minor points(i)  Should eligibility for the allowance in respect of nightsspent in the constituency be limited to periodswhen the House is sitting or not?(ii)  Ought some payment to be made to those ineligiblefor London subsistence allowance on specialoccasions when they are kept in Westminsterbecause of late or all-night sittings ?(iii)  The rules contemplate that a Member who has a homeonly in London is ineligible for a London allowance.Such a Member might conceivably acquire somemodest accommodation in his constituency whichcould be called a home.    He would thus become eligible for the London allowance and might be inpocket.    This would be an abuse - but very likelya trivial one.PLAN IIPlan II is a system of grants in respect of secretarial andcorrespondence expenses.    It is a scheme of the same general character as that embodied in C. (54) 96, though more restricted both in scope andin amount.    Under it a Member of Parliament who had actually incurredexpense up to say  250 a year in respect of -(a) pay of a secretary or fees paid to a typewriting andsecretarial agency;(b) stationery;(c) stamps;     and(d) telegraph and telephone charges would be entitled to claim that amount, or such part of it as he had actually incurred, from the Fees Office.    The reimbursement would,being in respect of actual expenses, not be subjected to tax.
It would have the presentational advantage of being limitedto providing for M.PS. a service which is provided by their employers for the vast majority of people who are employed by a business, and ofbeing linked to necessary expenditure involved in doing the job and not toliving expenses.    It might perhaps therefore look less like a concealedsalary increase than other forms of cash allowance.    As the expenses inrespect of which it would be paid would be expenses which can at present be claimed for tax purposes against Parliamentary salary, it would confer comparatively greater advantage on the poor Member andcomparatively less on the rich Member who pays a high rate of tax.It could be made available to all Members who wish to claim it without distinction of constituency, and could be applied if desired to Junior, or indeed Senior, Ministers.
