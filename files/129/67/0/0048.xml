(54) 19 the Chiefs of Staff have recommended that thepresent RODEO plan should be abandoned, and that as an alternative,a flying column should be sent into Cairo to rescue British subjects inthe Embassy area.2.      I agree that RODEO in its present form requires reconsideration.As at present planned, and in view of the opposition which might be met with, British forces would probably not arrive in time to prevent loss of life amongst the British community.    Some plan is therefore needed to speed up the arrival of at least the first British forces in both Cairo and alexandria..    The new operation proposed would also however, in my view, be a bad one.    It would not work, because it would not be possibleto persuade all the British community to go.     The livelihood of manyof them is in Egypt;    If they will not all go it will in practice beextre-mely difficult for us to withdraw our troops from Alexandria andCairo, however much we may have warned the British com:munity.We should be in a position of having to abandon British subjects whoselives might be once again in danger.3.      It is not politically advisable to give a new warning to theBritish community now.    There is no obvious need for it in the eyes of the public.    In addition, a considerable number of the Britishcommunity would be unwilling to act upon a warning in the absence ofany obvious reason.4.      There are other practical objections to the proposal for a&quot;cutting-out expedition&quot;.    Present plans for the protection of Britishsubjects involve the establishment of two protected zones, one inHeliopolis near Cairo and the Other in Alexandria.    These zones cannotbe established before the arrival of British troops, and until thenBritish subjects will be encouraged to remain in their homes.    come degree of law and order will have to be established before Britishsubjects can concentrate, and that will take a little time.5.      It would be impossible to justify any distinction between different categories of British subjects.     Of the 16,000 - 17,000 Britishsubjects in the Delta (of whom 10,000 or so are in Alexandria and theremainder in Cairo) about 12,000 are Maltese and Cypriots.    It willalso be difficult to abandon American nationals and those of our other allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation if they seek assistance.-1-
2oThe Italian, Greek and French communities are very large, and an egyptian mob is unlikely to distinguish between British and otherwesterners.6.      From the political as well as the practical point of view, a withdrawal of our troops would hardly be possible.    There might wellbe no effective Egyptian Government in existence, and we should thenbe expected to restore order.    We should look extremely foolish if,after having had troops in Egypt for all this time, we were simply todash into the Delta and out again leaving a state of chaos.    We wouldhave little option but to set up an alternative Egyptian Governmentand would be ill-advised not to do so when we had the chance.7.      The Egyptians already possess the plans of RODEO.    Their,knowledge of these is the best guarantee that they will behave, since they know that we have the power and the intention to occupy the Deltaif necessary.    This is a card, therefore, which we must keep.    only when we have an agreement with Egypt can we take the risk of reducing our forces in the Canal Zone to any large extent,8.     Conclusions(a) I should welcome a plan for the despatch of aflying column to Cairo, if this would expedite the arrival of the first British troops and thussave lives.     But our plans should also providefor a more massive follow-up operation, theobject of which should be to preserve Britishand foreign lives and property in Cairo and alexandria by restoring order there.(b) If such an operation is militarily too heavy a commitment, then logically our only course is toensure that it becomes unnecessary by coming toan agreement with Egypt.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.13th April, 1954.
