secret.(54) 1357th April, 1954CABINETTRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations-As the Cabinet agreed on 31st March (C.C0(54) 24th Conclusions,Minute 2) I asked the High Commissioner for South Africa to see me the following day, and handed him a letter, in the terms authorised bythe Cabinet, for Dr, Malan.2.        I have now received the annexed letter from the HighCommissioner containing a resolution which the South African Govern-ment intend to propose in the Union Parliament in place of the resolutionthey had intended to table.    My colleagues will see that the newresolution is less pressing in its terms than the old one.3.        I asked the High Commissioner how he thought I shouldinterpret this.    He said that he felt sure that Dr, Malan in amending the original draft of his resolution had endeavoured to take account ofthe arguments I advanced in my letter;  and he thought that the newresolution was intended to be more moderate and less urgent.    the formal request to the Queen for the transfer of the Territories had been dropped.    The new resolution, which he thought would probably command the support of the Opposition, would register the opinion of the SouthAfrican Parliament that the Territories should be transferred as soonas possible, and would urge the resumption of negotiations.    If theSouth African Government was to debate this matter at all, they could hardly say less.    The High Commissioner did not know what steps hisGovernment would take to secure the resumption of negotiations or whenthey would take them.    Even if we knew, as we did, that negotiationcould not result in transfer, he thought that some time had been gainedand he hoped that we could avoid expressing an immediate rebuff.    Hethought this was Dr. Malan&apos;s purpose, and that Dr. Malan probablywished, as we did, to avoid a head-on collision,4.        I think it is most desirable to avoid a collision of this kind aslong as possible.    If we are questioned in Parliament about this resolution, I suggest that we could properly say that it would be pre-mature to make any statement.    The resolution had not yet been passedby the South African Parliament.    If it were passed, it would be reasonable to wait and see what action, if any, the South African Govern-ment took upon it.    I would hope we could take the line in ourParliament that it would be premature and serve no useful purpose todiscuss this matter now.    The Government would, of course, take no action without the approval of Parliament, and there was really no occasion for debate in the absence of any Government proposal.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office,S.W.1.7th April, 1954.CABINET office record copy copy NO.  ^9
