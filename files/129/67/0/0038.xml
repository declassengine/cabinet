Supposing, by way of illustration, the single person&apos;s standard national insurance rate were raised from 325. 6d. to 375. 6d. and the married rate from545. to 6I5., with appropriate adjustments in other rates, the resulting increases in contributions would be as follows:  EmployedSelf-employedNon-employed46022Man5.  d.1 2*1   0Womand.11*106* Shared with the employer.
25. If the standard rate of industrial injury benefits were increased from555. to 63s. with appropriate adjustments in other rates, it would involve anincreased contribution of about Id. for a man shared with his employer.Contributions and Earnings6. The increase in average earnings in industry generally since 1946 was, by october 1953, 57 per cent, both for men and women; taking lower paid occupa-tions, the increase for men in agriculture was 36 per cent, and for women inlaundries 54 per cent. The increase in the initial contributions enacted in 1946that would result from making the further changes mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5would be about 30 per cent, both for men and women.Effect on the Exchequer and National Insurance Funds7. In the first full year, after allowing for the extra contribution income anda reduction in national assistance expenditure, there would be a saving to theExchequer as follows:   M.Additional Exchequer supplements to contributions ...      10-5Less estimated national assistance savings     ...      ...      17Exchequer saving in the first full year.........     -6-5The estimated cost of the additional benefits to the National Insurance Fund&apos;would be  73 millions a year rising to  122 millions by 1977-78. By the latter year,after allowing for the extra contribution income, the effect would be to add some 58 millions to the deficiency payment of  417 millions a year already forecastas the Exchequer liability. The invested balances of the National Insurance Fundsnow amount to just over  1,400 millions.The immediate cost of the additional Industrial Injuries benefits would beabout  3 millions a year.War Pensions8. An increase of 8s. in the war pensions rate similar to the increase in theindustrial injury benefits rate would cost the Exchequer about  8-5 millions inthe first full year.Timetable9. At least six months are required for the production and issue of new order books and of new contribution stamps. Another factor is that, owing tothe pressure upon the offices of the Ministry of Pensions and National insurance in the earlier part of the year due to the burden of sickness claims, it is impossibleto time any change to come into operation between 1st January and 30th April.O.
