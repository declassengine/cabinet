SECRET CABINET OFFICE /cc(54) 105 RECORD COPY copy no.       &apos;17th march, 1954cabinetEGYPT; DEFENCE NEGOTIATIONSFREEDOM OF NAVIGATION THROUGH THE SUEZ CANALMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation at their meeting on 16th September, 1953 (C0C.(53)53rd conclusions minute 1) the Cabinet decided that our delegation in Cairo should be instructed, among other things, to secure Egyptian assent to the inclusionof a clause about freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal in the preamble to the proposed Defence Agreement, and to indicate that weshould also wish to see a suitable article included in the body of theAgreement.2.        Agreement on a clause in the preamble was reached with the egyptians, in the following terms:-&quot;The Government of Egypt and the Government ofthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:Recognising that the Suez Maritime Canal is an integral part of Egypt and a waterway economically, commerciallyand strategically of international importance;  and being determined to uphold the 1888 Convention guaranteeingthe freedom of navigation of the Canal&quot;.The Foreign Secretary later told me that the Egyptians had been warnedby the delegation that, when the Agreement itself came to be drafted,we would ask them to include an article in the body of the Agreementcorroborating the principle enunciated in the preambles    The Egyptianswere not asked to commit themselves to this at the stage then reached,,3.        If negotiations for an Agreement with Egypt are resumed, Iconsider it essential that we should secure a reference in the preamble tofreedom of navigation in the terms already agreed with the Egyptians,and that this should be followed up by an article in the body of theAgreement.    The Foreign Secretary has expressed the view that it wouldbe difficult to include in a bi-lateral agreeinent obligations that were already the subject of a multilateral agreement.    In view, however, ofthe great importance of this, I hope it will be possible to find some wayround this difficulty.4.        Her Majesty&apos;s Government would, in my view, be open to gravecriticism for having failed to secure all possible safeguards for freedomof navigation if they concluded an agreement that contained no bindingarticle on this point.    The proposed Agreement will supersede the 1936Treaty, Article 8 of which expressly links the presence of British troopsin the Canal Zone with the maintenance of &quot;the liberty and entire securityof navigation of the Canal&quot;.    An Agreement which contained no article
on freedom of navigation having binding force would leave a gap thatwould be only too conspicuous to our own shipping industry, toGovernment supporters in Parliament and to the public, and to othercountries whose ships and commerce pass through the Canal0    an expression of the intentions of the Egyptian Government in the preamblewould not, it seems to me, by itself be sufficient,5Q No detailed consideration has yet been given by departments to the form which an article in the body of the Agreement should take0I therefore recommend -(a) that the Cabinet agree in principle thatthe inclusion of an article imposing bindingobligations on the Egyptians as regardsfreedom of navigation through the Suez Canalis an essential part of any new agreement,(b) that Departments should be asked to study the form which such an article might take,so that we shall be prepared with a specificproposal when the time comes to discuss the drafting of an article with the Egyptians.A.L.-B.Ministry of Transport, W. 1.,16TH MARCH, 1954.
