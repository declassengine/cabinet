RECORD COPYCABINETEAST-WEST TRADENote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate for the information of theCabinet the attached texts of a personal message from President Eisenhower to thePrime Minister and of the Prime Minister^ reply.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th April, 1954Personal Message from President Eisenhower to the Prime minister dated March 19, 1954Dear Winston:I have studied carefully the proposals for relaxation of East-West tradecontrols which officials of your Government gave to our Embassy in London onMarch 1. I understand that these proposals have been personally approved by you. ,45948
As you no doubt realize, the United States Government has for some time been conducting a searching review of all aspects of East-West trade controls. Ican assure you that the United States is prepared to go a significant distancetoward the contraction and simplification of those controls-objectives which weboth share.However, we do not believe we should go so great a distance and so suddenlyas the United Kingdom proposals suggest. To do so would be, I think, to go beyond what is immediately safe or in the common interest of the free world.I appreciate the weight that must be given to the strong views in favor ofdecontrol that are held by the British public and by the British business community.I assume, however, that you equally realize the weight of public and Congressionalopinion in the United States and the problems arising out of the Battle Act. Itwould be most unfortunate if pressures in either of our countries produced reactionsadversely affecting Anglo-American relations political, economic and military as well as the strength of the N.A.T.O. coalition.Ordinarily, I would not insert into our correspondence any matter of detailthat properly belongs to our respective diplomatic services. But because yourrecent speech indicates that you have personally considered some of the includedquestions of the broad general subject, I feel a slight deviation from our normal practice is justified.I feel strongly that the control system must continue to include equipment andraw materials of high war-potential significance, whether or not they have widecivilian use, where the Soviet bloc has a serious deficiency which it cannot overcomein a short time. However, there is room for discussion as to the scope and severity of the controls which should be applied under this principle.Whereas the United Kingdom proposals would appear to eliminate inter-national lists II and III, I am convinced that there is an area in which quantitative restrictions are the most appropriate control mechanism. Of course, I recognisethat it may be desirable to narrow substantially the area to which such controlsneed be applied, but.I do not think we can scrap them altogether.These seem to be the main differences between us.; Although the gap appearswide, we have resolved greater differences before this to our mutual advantage and will do so again. I suggest, then, that we ask our responsible officials to meet together very soon, presumably with their French counterparts, and try to find the common ground on which we can continue jointly to provide constructiveleadership to the consultative group.Finally, I have two other suggestions to make. For one thing, I think it wouldbe very useful if our representatives, and subsequently the members of the con-consultative group, were jointly to examine and assess the meaning and direction ofthe Russians&apos; new trade policy, including the much publicized Russian professionof interest in consumer goods. Secondly, I think it would be advantageous forour representatives to explore ways and means by which the free world mightexploit, in its relations with the. Soviet bloc, any decision to relax existing, controls.As ever,D. E.
Private and Personal10 Downing Street, Whitehall,My dear Friend, March 24, 1954.Thank you very much for your letter about East-West Trade. As consulta-tion and discussion between our two countries were urgent, I sent you my telegramof to-day&apos;s date. I now venture to put before you some of the wider considera-tions that have influenced my thought.While doing all that is possible to increase our joint strength and unity, I am anxious to promote an easement of relations with Soviet Russia and to encourageand aid any development of Russian life which leads to a wider enjoyment by theRussian masses of the consumer goods of which you speak and modern popularamenities and diversions which play so large a part in British and American life.I hope that this process will lead to some relaxation of the grim discipline of the peoples of this vast land ocean of Russia and its satellites. Moreover, trade meanscontacts and probably involves a good deal of friendly infiltration which I thinkwould be to our advantage from every point of view, including the military.I am of course opposed to exportation to Russia of weapons or military equipment in a direct form, but I do not think this principle should be used toban so many items because they might be used for military purposes in a secondaryor subsequent stage. Any advantage given by this would, only be on a small and almost trivial proportion of Russian armaments, for the whole scale of East-West Trade is small and we should be dealing only with a percentage of a per-centage. I do not think this ought to stand in the way of the widening of com-mercial intercourse so long as only conventional forms of equipment are concerned.On the contrary I believe that even in this limited military sphere we should, Ithink, gain as much or almost as much as we should lose.Over and beyond that there are those hopes of a broadening of Russian life and relaxation of international tension which may lead to the re-establishment ofa peaceful foundation for the tormented and burdened world.How minute do all these military considerations, arising out of trade aslimited, appear compared to the Hydrogen bomb and the rapid progress the Sovietsare said to be making with it. There is the peril which marches towards us andis nearer and more deadly to us than to you. We may be sure that whatever rawmaterials or equipment are available to the Russians, whether from their own resources or from imports, the first priority will be given to nuclear expansion,just as at a former stage in Germany guns counted before butter. I fear, therefore,that even a total prohibition of all East-West trade would not impede the physicalprogress of these fearful forces. On the other hand there is the hope that the sense of easement may render more fruitful those tentative yet inspiring conceptionsof which you told me at Bermuda and with which your letter of March 19 whichI received yesterday and to which I will reply later, also so pregnantly deals.I have not hampered this expression of my most anxious thought by expatiatingon the well known arguments about British trade in the present economic phase.I will merely mention the headings. If the United States will not let us pay forher goods by rendering reciprocal services and make a reasonable proportion ofthings your people want or might be attracted by, as is our deep desire, the present
deadlock must continue. As the old tag says, those who do not import cannotexport. I have learned all about these difficulties from my political youth up andam making no complaint. &quot; Off shore &quot; purchase is a Godsend, but you are stillin the position of having to give away on a vast scale with generosity and humanpatriotism what we should like to earn by hard work and mental exertion. the arrival of Germany and Japan in the world market make it necessary that weshould open out our trade in every possible direction for we have to keep 50 million people alive in this small island as well as maintaining the greatest armaments next to your own in the free world.As the proportions of our trade with Russia must in any case be on a minorscale for many years, I cannot rate the commercial aspect so highly as I do thoseI have mentioned above.I enclose a copy of the telegram which I have agreed with my colleagues andwhich will by now have reached you.With all good wishes,Yours ever,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The President of the United States.
