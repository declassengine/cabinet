Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1954: Copy No.CABINET office record COPYCABINETSUDANNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed record of a conversation between the Minister of State and the Sudanese Prime Minister inKhartoum on 4th March. ^ ^Foreign Office, S.W.1,16th March, 1954.annex  went to see the Prime Minister this morning at his office in the Ministryof the Interior. I began by expressing my sympathy to the Sudan Governmentupon the unfortunate incidents of Monday. I said that I thought it was most fortunate that sectarian differences should have reached the stage of civildisturbances. I spoke of troubles in other countries between Moslems and Hindusand Catholics and Protestants and said that nothing could be more prejudicial to law and order and the peaceful development of democratic institutions thanthese sort of events. He professed to agree and said that he thought that Mondayhad done the Umma Party a great deal of damage, that many moderate Ansarin Khartoum were most upset at what had taken place and their confidencehad been shaken in the Umma Party.2. The Prime Minister clearly intends to place the largest measure of responsi-bility possible upon the British officials, particularly upon the dead BritishCommandant of Police. He said that he had suggested to the Police Commandantthat the Ansar supporters should be surrounded on the race-course early onMonday morning and despatched by lorry or train to the places whence they came. I said that surely that would have led to a pitched battle. The PrimeMinister did not answer that comment but said that the Police Commandant andhis second-in-command had assured him that there Would be no trouble. TheUmma leaders had promised to keep their supporters under control and only tohave orderly demonstrations.r  45878CONFIDENTIALC. (54) 10417th March, 1954
3. He also had some complaint against the Governor of Khartoum on theground that when asked to draw up an order saying &quot; I, the Governor ofKhartoum, ban processions,&quot; he had in fact produced something which looked as if he^ the Governor, did not believe in the ban which was being promulgated.I gathered that that would be the Prime Minister^ explanation of why the banwas not eventually made.4. He did concede that some Ansar supporters had been turned back from various places and did agree that it was very difficult to stop people coming intoKhartoum by lorry over the desert. I said that I understood that the Egyptianradio was saying that it had all been a British imperialist plot; he would know what nonsense that was. He appeared to agree with me and said &quot; they are evensaying that your staying on in Khartoum after the others have gone shows thatthe British are &apos; up to something.&apos; &quot;5. I then turned the conversation to Egyptian interference. He was obviouslyunwilling to discuss that. He tried to defend Neguib&apos;s visit on the ground thathe was respected by a lot of Sudanese, but he had no answer to my contention that it was most provocative. He said rather feebly that the trouble would have happened whether Neguib had come or not.6. I then raised the question of relations between British officials and ministers. I said that some of his Ministers appeared to have no confidence intheir officials. He did not dispute that but came back in a rambling way to theincidents of Monday, rather indicating that he thought that he had been badlyadvised by his own British officials. I said that Her Majesty&apos;s Government reallywanted the orderly constitutional development of democratic institutions. we wished the Sudan to have friendly relations with Egypt because of their common interests in the Nile and the fact that they were neighbours and spoke the samelanguage. At the same time we hoped that the Sudan would have friendly relationswith Britain because of past relations. I saw nothing inconsistent in these two things. The British Government has quite enough problems in the world to dealwith, we did not want to add to them by causing trouble in the Sudan. We had decided to transfer power in the Sudan and we would keep our word and our officials, if treated properly, would co-operate loyally.7. He then suddenly became very forthcoming and said that he wanted as many British technical officers to stay in the Sudan as possible; they knew theSudan, its agriculture, &amp;c; he did not want to have to bring in experts from outside, from Switzerland or countries like that, who would have to be trained.He wanted a large measure of assistance from the British in the future in these fields. I said if he would only make a few public speeches along those lines hewould at once restore confidence between Ministers and officials. He said thatI must realise there were some things that could be said privately which could notyet be said publicly. He had enemies, and it would be stated that he had changedas soon as he became Prime Minister, that he had gone over to the British. It was quite impossible for him yet to make the sort of statement that he had madeprivately to me.8. I said that what seemed to me one of the difficulties in Middle Eastleadership was that the leaders said one thing privately but did not have the courage, if he would forgive me using that word, to say it publicly. I invited him to consider the example of Nkrumah, who had been in prison when I was last in the Gold Coast in 1949 but had since become Prime Minister and by his attitude to the British Administration had created an atmosphere of mutual confidence. If he could do that he would do a very good service to the Sudan.9. On these terms we parted. The Prime Minister was affable throughoutand apparently spoke in good faith, but I have not the slightest idea whether one can believe a word he says.SELWYN LLOYD.Khartoum, 4th March, 1954.
