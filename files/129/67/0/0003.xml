i19/17Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1954SECRET QABlNET OFFICE Copy No.C. (54) 103 RECORD COPY16 th March, 1954CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed record of a conversation between Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, Permanent Under-Secretary of State,Foreign Office, and the United States Minister in London.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,15th March, 1954.ANNEXMr. Butterworth called this morning and repeated the communication he had made on Saturday to Sir Harold Caccia to the effect that the United States Govern-ment felt that this was a good, and probably the only, moment at which to resume the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations with any prospect of success.I told Mr. Butterworth that the whole question was now being carefully considered here. Nevertheless I should be wanting in frankness if I did not tell himprivately that the attitude of the Egyptians in the Sudan constituted a seriousobstacle. In particular the design to alter the balance in the Governor-GeneraFsCommission, if executed, would create a situation which would render any nego-negotiation over the base quite fruitless. Mr. Butterworth said that he trusted thatwe should be able to come to some composition over the constitution of theCommission.Before leaving he read me a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Cairoreporting the Egyptians as saying that the Governor-General was quite capableof controlling the Mahdi if he had a mind to do so. I explained to Mr. Butterworthwhy this was in fact not the case.I. KIRKPATRICK.15th March, 1954.45872
