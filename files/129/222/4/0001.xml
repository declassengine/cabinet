^  r LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1987-88

Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

INTRODUCE

In constr^S^H^a legislative programme  for this Session we have to

allow for ^^^^options  in the timing of the General Election.

Although ther|^^  a number of possibilities,  for legislative planning

purposes we c^^^fJk on the basis of the following two:

a. No General Election this year and therefore a necessarily

short final MA of this Parliament,  starting in

Oc t obe r /Novemb^^,^^^^.

b. A General Election this year followed by the first Session of

a new Parliament.    (For planning purposes we can assume this to

start in October/November 1987.    It could, of course, start

earlier, but in that case the first weeks of the Session could be

taken up with re-introduc j^^of some of the Bills lost on

Dissolution. ) ^.mta

The decision that needs to be ta^Bl^gw is the selection of Bills on

which work should be put  in hand s^^^^ko place the Government  in the

best position to face either of the^^o^^ons.    It is not practical, or

politically sensible,  to envisage two^Kmly separate programmes. The

Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation^B^M^.ttee  (QL) have considered

that the simplest and clearest approach^SfJ^^^draw up a programme of

Bills  for a full  (first) Session from whrw^^^nall selection could be

made to provide a politically suitable prografM^for a short (final)

Session.

2. Some further Bills may yet emerge, and the decisions that we take

now therefore do not necessarily represent the final shape of the

programme.    It is, however,  important that at this po:Lftt in the year we

commission as much preparatory work as we can on thejfcEUBs that we shall

need,  and this  is particularly important for long ana^Jj^*J|lex Bills. QL

have therefore sought to draw up a full and politicall^^H^st

programme, with no deliberate slack in it. ^^^i^

PROPOSED PROGRAMME ^^^W

3. After discussion as necessary with the Ministers concern^^fflk have

drawn up the suggested programmes for full and short 1987-88 Se^^S^B

set out at Annex A.     (A list of the Bills sought by Ministers bu^ nj^^


recommended by QL is at Annex B.)    The hybrid Dartford Crossing Bill,

which is still to be introduced in the present Session, will certainly

need to be revived in the 1987-88 Session, and hence added to the list

^ at Annex a.    Although the number of Bills in the proposed programme is

^bjjot unusually high,  the programme is deliberately weighted towards Bills

^^%at QL consider to be of prime political importance.    There is also an

^ u^^ual number of long Bills.    In both drafting and Parliamentary terms,

^0^W,  the proposed programme is very substantial indeed and any

significant additions to it will require that something is dropped to

make room.

Water Legislation

4. ThAAjUhrnment remains committed to the privatisation of the water

industry^Hj T^he benefits of that must be obtained as soon as possible.

For the 19*^^%^.Session, however, QL propose that we should attempt no

more than a^^BM^ Bill to give water authorities power to prepare for

privatisation^^^n^^o take powers on water metering.    QL was advised

that it was essSdR^i that the paving powers should be in place before

the main Water pT^^^^ation Bill got far on its Parliamentary passage,

since the active ^^K^t of water authorities which would be needed for

the success of the^k^m^r ivat isat ion venture could not be forthcoming

while the water author^^ks &apos;  powers were in doubt.    QL were certain that

a Session of normal lmgth could not accommodate both the paving Bill

(which would itself be highly controversial) and the main privatisation

measure.    The Secretary of State for the Environment is now consulting

colleagues on the Steering Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee

on Economic Affairs  (e(a)),  on proposals  to restructure the water

industry,  and to retain withinwmSpublic sector a number of, mainly

regulatory,   functions that wera^RgAosed for privatisation under last

year&apos;s White Paper.    If those pr^BMfcs are agreed,  the resulting

privatisation legislation could na^^^^any event, be prepared before

January 1988 at the earliest.    But WJ&apos; sEr^ecommendation against

attempting the main privatisation Bi^^^P^^he same Session as  the paving

measure is  independent of E(A)&apos;s concrolJrs on the Secretary of State

for the Environment&apos;s latest proposals .^mR^lieve that the main

privatisation Bill should come forward i^^^e%6econd Session after an

Election and be given advance drafting autWorJBL accordingly.

Housing Legislation

5. After Abolition of Domestic Rates and Water,  the third major

Environment Bill that we shall need to consider is Housing, on which QL

recommend that a place should be kept open in the pr jfl me for a long

Bill.    The longer and more controversial that a Bi 1 lmiM^^wever, the

more important its early introduction becomes,  and I &quot;3fCI| that a

comprehensive measure on housing would need to be put r ^^|^forthwith

if it were to be enacted next Session.    If there is real about

that timetable,  then I invite Cabinet to consider the poss%j^Jjfcv of

legislating in only part of this area in the first Session ^IQan

election.    On that approach,   the obvious candidate would be d^^SA^ition

in the private rented sector, which is classically a topic tha^BH^ be

addressed early in the life of a Parliament,  if it is to be effe^ci^^


Proposals for a Short Session

k   6.      At this stage we need to do no more than assure ourselves that the

Fa preparatory work we are putting in hand will enable us to select an

^Appropriate smaller package of Bills for a short Session preceding an

j^ratection in 1988,  if that is required.    QL believe that the selection

  o^Bted for this purpose in Annex A shows  that there need be no doubt on

What score.    The main point to which I draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention is

that it would be proposed to introduce the Abolition of Domestic Rates

Bill even in a short Session as a mark of the Government&apos;s commitment to

that policy, even though the Bill could not hope to get to Royal Assent

in the tim^available.

7. Many o^Ji^ills listed at Annex B will doubtless find their way

into the progKmw for later Sessions but QL did not believe that any of

them had suff^ftwkpriority for inclusion in  1987-88.    I shall comment

on two points o4P^^kFirst, QL did not consider that it was possible to

take a view on Fl^^Vmp  (Northern Ireland) this side of a General

Election.    Second,^DWwgh QL have not chosen any Bills bearing on the

City,  we must recognfcsejtat a need for legislation may yet emerge in

ADVANCE DRAFTING AUTHORITY

8. In recent years Cabinet and^OL have adopted the practice of giving

&apos;advance places&apos;   to a few BillA kt require a particularly long time

for preparation.    This has und^^M^^y had its uses,  but QL have two

reservations to report.    First, ^B^Wlieve that the half dozen places to

which this scheme has been applie^^M W:oo many:    we believe that in

future the arrangements should be lffw to two Bills a year and that,

in order to qualify,  they should be^fccZd^ionally long,  complex,  and of

cardinal political importance.    Secon^^KA phrase  &apos;advance place&apos; has

sometimes been misinterpreted as sugges^^^|the advance guarantee of a

sure place in the programme two Ses s ions^BkJfc.    Such a guarantee cannot

be offered,  and QL recommend that in futu^^ t^^more accurate

terminology  &apos;advance drafting authority1  shq^^lbe used.    On the

criteria suggested, the clear first choice for such authority for the

1988-89 Session is the main Water Bill.    If Cabinet agree,  the second

choice might be remitted for QL to make in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s

discussion.

TIMELY PREPARATION OF BILLS ^^^L

9. This  is not the first submission to the Cabinet on^H^^Legislative

programme to stress the importance of Departments maintalft^^^&amp;the

timetables that are agreed for the preparation of their B:^^^rd, in

particular,  getting their instructions to Parliamentary CounjJ^^i good

time.    It  is absolutely vital that these rules should be obser^l^When

we are proposing such a heavy programme.    I invite colleagues a

close eye on this during the year.


CONCLUSION

^   10.    I invite the Cabinet -

a. To approve the list of Bills at Annex A for the 1987-88

Session.

b. To approve the criteria for advance drafting authority set out

at paragraph 8;  to agree that the Water Bill should be given

advance drafting authority for the 1988-89 Session; and to invite

QL to allocate advance drafting authority to a second Bill for that

Sessi^a in the light of the Cabinet discussion.

c. ^^^efcyite all Ministers concerned to ensure that agreed

t ime r^Rk^f or the preparation of legislation for the 1987-88

Sessio^^^^bserved.
