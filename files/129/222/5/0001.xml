&lt;^^&gt; CABINET

&lt;^^^&gt; STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1987

^^/^?O Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence

I attach the draft of my 1987 Statement on the Defence Estimates, which I

propose to present to Parliament on Wednesday 6 May. It has been amended

to take account of comments made in discussion at the meeting of the

Defence and Ovec/sea^olicy Committee on 18 March, and received since. In

addition,  two ke^Dy^S^sraphs on the defence budget (601 and 603) have been

redrafted to take faxcyunt of the revised inflation forecast in the

Financial StatemenN-ajjKJL^udget Report.

2. This year&apos;s Stataj^rft-Vvas a strong nuclear flavour, reflecting

developments in arms contr^L^pegotiations and the debate at home on NATO

strategy and Trident.    Otlr^/^Xpical themes reflected are public

uncertainty about the realtfiy^J: the Soviet threat  (increasing in

proportion to Mr Gorbachev&apos;V-*j C^vatives); and questioning in some

European quarters of the Unit^f^tMies nuclear presence in Europe. The

underlying theme is continuity^Oai^oolicy.

3. Chapter 1 sets our policy irr ^he^tontext of the international

strategic situation, and in partici&lt;&gt;ar J }&gt;e United States/Soviet arms

control negotiations;  it cautions aga^*f t^-either unilaterally delivering,

or negotiating, ourselves into a less^Swre world.    Chapter 2 chronicles

developments  in arms control negotiatio^/,//Chapter 3 records developments

in NATO and in European security co-oper^vion.    Chapter 4 describes our

forces,  their roles and equipment.    Chapter 5 sets out procurement policy,

including our efforts to secure better value for money through competition

and international collaboration.    Chapter 6 dealswith the management of

defence resources, and in particular repeats aniy^eynforces the message of

last year&apos;s Statement that the ending of the perXodMif real growth in the

defence budget will necessitate difficult decisiory6/Tm\reconciling

aspirations with the money available.    Annex A desx^i^Vs&apos;N the military

strengths of East and West.

4. As usual the Statement contains several self-conta^wT^ssays on

aspects of policy.    Four out of five essays this year reflae^-the topical

issues mentioned in paragraph 2.     &apos;Nuclear Weapons and NAwVjKYstegy1

explains the NATO policy of deterrence, while  &apos;The Minimum NXLJ  A*ent&apos; sets

out the case for an independent British deterrent and for acqurfr^ffg

Trident rather than any alternative.     &apos;70 Years On: A Count ry^Ar^a/fcause?&apos;

marks the anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution with an ana\y&amp;&amp;/a&amp; the


historical and ideological roots of Soviet policies and actions. &apos;The

,    American Pillar&apos;  explains the importance of the United States contribution

^\ to NATO and of the presence of United States  forces  in Europe.    There are,

)) as usual, a number of smaller  &apos;boxes&apos;  on subjects of special interest,

^illustrations and photographs,  all serving to break up the text.

vJ6f/   I shall aim to remove the last  two remaining square brackets by the

^tj^H^^Sabinet meets on 2 April.

CHAPTER ONE: MAINTAINING SECURITY

NATO - THE DUAL APPROACH

101. 1986 was an eventful year in the field of international security. September saw

the signature of the first major arms control agreement since 1979: on Confidence- and

Security-Building Measures in Europe. In October, the radical proposals discussed at

the meeting in Reykjavik between President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev gave a new

stimulus to the debate that was already taking place about the best means of providing

for Western security in the years ahead, and, in particular, focused renewed attention

on the role of nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.

102. These were among the issues faced by the Prime Minister and President Reagan

when they met in November at Camp David to discuss the way forward on arms control

after Reykjavik: a meeting that successfully established the basis of an Alliance

strategy for pursuing the opportunities for progress. The two leaders agreed that

priority should be given to an agreement on intermediate nuclear forces, with restraints

on shorter-range systems; a reduction of 50% over five years in US and Soviet strategic

offensive weapons; and a ban on chemical weapons. In all three cases, effective

verification would be an essential element. The main features of this approach were

endorsed both by Eurogroup Ministers and by NATO Ministers collectively in December.

Further details are given in Chapter 2.

103. Whether there is now an opportunity to secure major reductions in nuclear

armouries remains to be seen. But in seeking to exploit any opportunity we must keep

our eyes fixed firmly on the fundamental objective set out in the preamble to the North

Atlantic Treaty and reproduced [below]. For taking steps that may at first sight seem

desirable in themselves will be to no avail if their result is to jeopardise the peace and

freedom that we have now enjoyed for over 40 years.

&apos;The Parties to this Treaty .......are determined to safeguard the freedom,

common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles

of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.&apos;

104. Maintaining security is ultimately a political and diplomatic as much as a military

problem. That is why NATO has always taken a dual approach, seeking political

dialogue and greater understanding alongside deterrence and defence. For real security

cannot exist where distrust and suspicion reign. Our ultimate aim must be a relation-

ship with the East that is not merely proof against all possible threats, but free of such

threats. The British Government has therefore welcomed the steps taken by President

Reagan and Mr Gorbachev to build a relationship of greater understanding between East

and West. But we recognise that this search will be a gradual process; for the Soviet

Union and Western countries start from such different standpoints.

THE CHALLENGE FOR NATO

105. As we argue on page [ ], it has always been an illusion to believe that the Soviet

Union is basically motivated by the same aims as Western nations: Soviet history and,

above all, Marxist-Leninist ideology have over the years caused Soviet leaders to adopt

a very different approach to international relations from that taken in the West. Mr

Gorbachev&apos;s &apos;new thinking&apos; is a welcome development; but it is not yet clear how far it

will be reflected in Soviet behaviour in the foreign policy field.

106. There is nothing to suggest that Soviet leaders have any desire for war in Europe.

Indeed, rather the reverse; for the risk of military failure remains too high. But

although they may have no wish to promote war, they do seek by other means

constantly to weaken NATO and to expand Soviet influence in our continent, taking full

advantage of the freedoms enjoyed by Western societies to achieve their aims. And

their activities in this field are backed by an enormous, and constantly expanding,

military might, which they have frequently been ready to use in support of political

ends, both directly and indirectly, as events in East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,

Poland and Afghanistan have demonstrated.

107. This expanding Soviet military might has been financed by defence expenditure

that increased by about 50% in real terms between 1970 and 1985 - substantially more

than the increase in NATO expenditure over the same period. During that time, while a

broad parity has been maintained in US and Soviet strategic nuclear capabilities, the

Soviet Union has increased and enhanced its theatre nuclear systems in Europe. The

1970s saw the introduction of a range of improved Soviet ballistic missiles: the SS-21 in

1975; the modified Scaleboard (SS-22) and the extremely capable SS-20 in 1977; and the

SS-23, tested in 1979 and deployed in 1985.   This capability, which directly threatens

2

CONFIDENTIAL

Western Europe, was unmatched by NATO until the deployment of Western ground-

launched cruise missiles and Pershing II in 1983. Even now, as Annex A demonstrates,

the Soviet Union has a 3:1 superiority in warheads on longer-range intermediate nuclear

missiles, a 9:1 advantage in shorter-range missile launchers and an 8:1 advantage in

short-range missile launchers.

108. The build-up of Soviet and other Warsaw Pact conventional forces over the last

ten to fifteen years has been no less marked. During that period the Soviet Navy has

acquired an ocean-going fleet, which includes three Kiev class aircraft carriers, some

36 cruisers, 60 or so destroyers and about 200 nuclear-powered submarines; of the

latter, over 60 carry nuclear ballistic missiles, as well as having a developing land-

attack capability from submarine-launched cruise missiles. Warsaw Pact land forces

west of the Urals have expanded from 165 divisions in the early 1970s to nearly 190

divisions now. During the same period, the Pact deployed some 10,000 additional tanks

and some 15,000 additional and larger-calibre artillery pieces with enhanced capabili-

ties, while NATO&apos;s numbers in these categories increased only slightly. The Warsaw

Pact has continued to update its air forces with the introduction of new fighter, bomber

and support aircraft.

109. The result, as Annex A shows, is that in Europe the Soviet Union and its allies

enjoy considerable advantages over NATO in conventional forces. They have the

potential to bring to bear substantial numbers of fighting men in a relatively short

period. Perhaps more significantly, they enjoy considerable numerical superiority over

NATO in several key categories of weapon system. For example, on the Central Front

they have twice as many aircraft and tanks and three times as many artillery pieces.

They enjoy similar superiorities in other key categories of equipment, such as infantry

fighting vehicles and helicopters. In combination, and taken together with the forward

deployment of the forces concerned, these represent significant advantages for the

Warsaw Pact.

110. Against this background, it is vital that, whatever we may assess current Soviet

intentions to be, the West should not lower its guard. For, given the association of an

expansionist history and a hostile ideology with an immense military power, we cannot

presume - notwithstanding the encouraging developments that are taking place in

Moscow under Mr Gorbachev&apos;s leadership - that the Soviet Union will never again resort

to force, whether in Europe or elsewhere.

&apos;If there is an elephant in your neighbour&apos;s garden, there is much to be said

flower beds.&apos;

Lord Carrington,

Secretary General, NATO,

Oslo University,

April, 1985

NATO&apos;S MILITARY STRATEGY

111. NATO&apos;s aim is both to deter the direct use of force, and to prevent other,

indirect, uses of Soviet military power, such as the application of unacceptable political

pressures on the political and economic life of our free Western states. We meet the

military challenge by seeking to convince the Warsaw Pact that, if it did resort to

force, it would not succeed easily or quickly in achieving its military objectives. Hence

NATO&apos;s need for the full spectrum of modern conventional weaponry to check and, if

possible, repulse an attack.

112. But history, too often repeated, has shown that this traditional kind of defence

cannot always be relied on to deter an attacker, even when the defender has a

superiority in conventional forces - a position that is certainly not true of Western

Europe. The aggressor might miscalculate the likely response. Or he might calculate

that he could fight from start to finish on the territory of others: in such circumstances

even if he lost, the destruction and suffering would be largely visited on his military

forces, while his homeland remained a sanctuary. And his political and economic

reasons for initiating aggression might be quite strong enough for him to take that risk.

That is why a wholly &apos;defensive defence&apos; posture, such as some have recommended for

NATO, would not be sufficient to provide full security for the West.

113. It is also the reason - quite apart from the Soviet Union&apos;s own massive nuclear

armoury - why NATO must retain nuclear weapons. In order effectively to deter a

potential aggressor, it is important for him to calculate that he would run real risk of

suffering unacceptable damage to his own territory and to his own people if he were to

attack. Only nuclear weapons can threaten him with that risk. The nuclear

contribution to our defence is therefore essential to effective deterrence. For the risks

of nuclear war will always be such that it would never be a rational act to provoke it.

A fuller discussion of the place of nuclear weapons in NATO strategy is included on

&apos;Be careful above all things not to let go of the atomic weapon until you are

sure, and more than sure, that other means of preserving peace are in your

hands.&apos;

Sir Winston Churchill,

Address to a Joint Session of the US Congress,

January, 1952

114. NATO&apos;s policy of deterrence has served our purpose well for nearly 40 years. We

cannot prove that it has been the sole factor preventing major war, or the spread of

Soviet influence, in Europe during that time. But nor can its opponents prove-that the

alternatives they propose would be as certain of maintaining peace, while at the same

time preserving those aspects of our society that we most value. It would be the height

of folly now to abandon a strategy that has been tried and tested, for alternatives that

provide no sure guarantee of giving us equal security.

BRITISH DEFENCE POLICY

115. Britain plays a major role in the NATO Alliance. As we describe in Chapter 3, we

are the only European member to contribute to all three elements of NATO&apos;s triad of

forces. The substantial contribution made by the three Services to each of our four

NATO roles is considered in Chapter 4; while on page [ ] we look at our activities

outside the NATO area. The resources that Britain allocates to defence -  18,782

million in 1987-88 - put us near the top of the NATO league, whether measured in

absolute terms, as a percentage of gross domestic product or per capita. We continue

to plan substantial investment in each of our main defence roles. And, as we describe

in Chapters 5 and 6, we are energetically pursuing improvements in efficiency, so as to

achieve better value for the money that we spend on defence.

116. At the same time, and in line with NATO&apos;s dual approach, we are working to

reduce East-West tension and the risk of conflict. Britain is playing a very active role in

this field. The Lord President of the Council led a parliamentary delegation to Moscow

early in 1986; the Soviet Foreign Minister came to London last July; and in the spring

of this year the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary visited Moscow - the first official

Prime Ministerial visit since 1975.

117. Our hope and aim is that both East and West should pursue with energy and vision

the new possibilities for arms control that have recently opened up, and that we should

make progress towards a world of greater security and cooperation. We do not expect

dramatic results overnight. But, thanks in no small part to the cohesion and

determination that NATO has shown in its dealings with the Warsaw Pact, the prospects

look better now than they have done for many years.

118. We must ensure that nothing is done to damage those prospects; and that we do

not, through impatience, either negotiate - or unilaterally deliver - ourselves into a less

secure world. Now is a time for steady nerves; realism in assessing the opportunities

for progress; and readiness to grasp them where they exist. By such means we are

working to provide a better future for ourselves and our children, and to ensure that the

benefits of peace, prosperity and freedom with security may be shared by all.

ESSAY

70 YEARS ON: A COUNTRY OR A CAUSE?

1. 1987 marks the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, which brought

the Soviet Union into being. So it is timely to ask: what is the Soviet Union today?

Is it a country with values and concerns much as our own - to live in freedom and

prosperity and in harmony with its neighbours? The friendly face that Soviet

leaders under Mr Gorbachev present to the world has encouraged some to take that

view. Or is it an implacable opponent, bent only on increasing its influence at the

expense of Western interests and values? Which of these two pictures is nearer to

the truth?

2. It is important that we try to understand what Soviet aims and intentions&apos; are

because they must in some degree determine our own policies. The massive

military potential that successive Soviet leaders have developed and have chosen to

deploy facing, or to target on, Western Europe is indisputable. But we have to ask

ourselves whether these capabilities are merely insurance against attack; or

whether they might also have aggressive purposes. For if harmonious co-existence

were the real long-term Soviet aim, and if Soviet military strength were - and

would remain - merely an insurance, then the West might conceivably reduce its

armaments with no fear of the consequences. If, on the other hand, expansion or

the extension of Soviet influence were even a partial Soviet motive there would be

a very strong argument for exercising caution in our dealings with the Soviet

Union.

3. Russia has always been a difficult country for the West to understand.

&apos;Secrecy presides over everything&apos; was a Western view of Russia 150 years ago, and

in this respect little has changed since then. The new Soviet leadership, with its

policy of glasnost&apos; (openness), has begun to lift the veil; but there is still a very

long way to go. The secrecy has spawned a small industry in the West analysing

Soviet ideology, actions, motives and intentions, with predictable scope for

disagreement about the results. There is nonetheless much common ground, and

this includes the importance of Russian history and of Marxist-Leninist ideology in

shaping Soviet thinking and policies.

4. The Russian view of the world has always emphasised that security can only

be achieved from a position of military strength. Until the 18th century Russia had

no clearly defined natural frontiers to east or west; in the west this is still largely

the case. Russian rulers back to the 15th century and earlier were therefore

obsessed by their vulnerability to invasion and encirclement. Their way of meeting

the danger was both to build up large forces to impress and frighten off potential

enemies; and periodically to extend their territory. This can be seen in the seven-

fold expansion of the Russian Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries, when it

reached something like the size and shape of the Soviet Union today. In more

recent times, Western intervention during the Russian civil war and, later, the Nazi

invasion of the Soviet Union, with its appalling toll of 20 million Soviet dead,

reinforced the obsession.

5. But in 1917 a new element was superimposed on the traditional Russian

obsession with security: Marxist-Leninist ideology. From his seat in the British

Museum, Marx had earlier posited that under &apos;capitalism&apos;, social relations were

based on an antagonistic relationship between those who owned the means of

production and those whose only possession was their ability to work. Conflict

between the two was inevitable. Capitalism, however, contained the seeds of its

own downfall: Marx took the view that the working class would eventually

overthrow the capitalist class and establish a classless society based on production

for use rather than for profit. Marx expected such revolutions to occur first in the

industrialised countries of Western Europe.

6. Lenin, the practical revolutionary, added two important elements to this

theory. The first was the concept of an elite band of revolutionaries - the Party -

who would lead the masses to a new society. He thus provided an instrument to

speed the destruction of the existing order in Russia without having to wait for

history to take its course. His second contribution was to take Marx&apos;s concept of

the &apos;exploiting&apos; and &apos;exploited&apos; classes and extend it to the relationship between

nations. Lenin proposed &apos;imperialism&apos; as the last stage of capitalism and argued

that this &apos;exploitation&apos; would eventually lead colonial peoples to drive out the

imperialists.

2

CONFIDENTIAL

7. With the success of the Bolshevik revolution Lenin thus established in power a

Party whose view was of a world divided into two implacably opposed systems,

each struggling to shift the global balance of power in its own favour; a Party

which held it as a scientific truth that communism would triumph in the end; and

which saw its duty as giving history a helping hand wherever possible.

8. In the early days of the Second World War the Soviet Union provided a

graphic demonstration of this by taking over the three independent Baltic states,

Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - formerly part of the Tsarist Empire - by agreement

with Hitler under the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. At the same time, eastern

Poland and parts of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Finland were annexed. After the

war this expansion continued, with the establishment of Soviet control over the

East European countries of East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,

Romania and Bulgaria. The Soviet claim that the communist regimes in these

states are the product of popular national and inevitable revolution is false, since

most of them were installed by means of rigged elections or manipulation,

facilitated by the presence of Soviet troops; and attempts to change the situation

have usually been crushed by force of arms, as in East Germany in 1953, Hungary in

1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and, indirectly, Poland in 1981.

9. In large part the establishment of communist regimes in these countries

served as a buffer both against political &apos;contamination&apos; from the West - for the

existence of Western democracies in Europe is a constant reproach to the Soviet

totalitarian system - and against the risk that any future conventional war might

be fought on Soviet territory. Some have argued that this somehow justifies the

Soviet hold over Eastern Europe. Some go on to suggest that the Soviet Union has

no intention of extending its reach any further westwards into Europe. On the first

point, most people would profoundly disagree that national insecurity is a fair

excuse for the curtailment of others&apos; national and individual freedoms. The second

point is the nub of this essay.

10. Faced with such an assertion, we are bound to ask: can you be absolutely

certain? For although we have no reason to believe that the Soviet Union would

run the risk - as long as NATO remains strong and united - of a direct military

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

incursion into Western Europe, we cannot ignore the evidence of past Russian and

Soviet history, which has been living proof of the idea that the best form of

defence is expansion. And even if Soviet leaders are not actively seeking further

territorial expansion, the events of recent years suggest that they are always ready

to extend Soviet political influence wherever possible, often using military means

to that end.

11. Nor should we forget the basic tenets of Marxist-Leninist ideology. In 1916,

for example, Lenin wrote:

&apos;Socialists cannot, without ceasing to be socialists, be opposed to all

war ... Only after we have overthrown, finally defeated and expro-

priated the bourgeoisie of the entire world ... will wars become

impossible.&apos;

Although - as the development of nuclear weapons made the very prospect of con-

flict between East and West horrendous - Soviet leaders ceased to regard a final

war between communism and capitalism as inevitable, the Marxist-Leninist view of

the continuing and inevitable struggle between the two systems remained

unchanged. The liberal democratic idea of harmony between states is foreign to

traditional Soviet thought. For Soviet leaders, peaceful coexistence has been seen

not as a permanent condition but as a period of transition, on the way to the

ultimate triumph of communism.

12. Mr Gorbachev, like his predecessors, has testified his adherence to the tenets

of Marxism-Leninism. Consider, for example, this extract from his report to the

27th Soviet Party Congress in February, 1986:

&apos;World developments confirm the fundamental Marxist-Leninist conclu-

sion that the history of society is ......        a law-governed onward process.

Not only do its contradictions pass sentence on the old world, on

everything that impedes advance; they are also the source, the driving

force behind the social progress that is taking place in conditions of a

struggle that is inevitable so long as exploitation and exploiting classes

still exist.&apos;

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

13. On the other hand, at the Party Congress and elsewhere, Mr Gorbachev has

spoken of &apos;a growing tendency towards interdependence of the countries of the

world community&apos; and of the need for &apos;new thinking&apos; in the nuclear and space age.

He has argued that the task of ensuring security can only be resolved by political,

not military, means; that security between states can only be mutual; and that in

the present situation &apos;confrontation between capitalism and socialism can proceed

only and exclusively in the forms of peaceful competition and peaceful rivalry&apos;.

This is a welcome evolution of Soviet political thinking; but it is not yet clear how

much weight it will be given, as opposed to traditional Marxism-Leninism, which in

some ways it contradicts.

14. Recent moves towards a more open and humane Soviet Union are also

welcome. But we should not forget that Mr Gorbachev&apos;s talk of &apos;democratisation&apos;

does not mean democracy in the Western sense; no weakening of the Communist

Party&apos;s control over all areas of Soviet life is intended. And although Mr

Gorbachev has made encouraging steps towards freeing the Soviet Union from the

ideological shackles of a theory of permanent confrontation between capitalist and

communist systems, the weight of ideology still bears heavily both on Soviet theory

and on Soviet practice. Moreover, the institutions of Soviet society have stayed

unaltered. It remains to be seen, therefore, whether the &apos;new thinking&apos; will be

accompanied by changes in the objectives of Soviet foreign policy.

15. No Soviet leader has yet been prepared clearly to renounce the idea of the

global struggle against capitalism. That struggle continues today. In the West it is

conducted primarily by means of propaganda, appeals to Western peoples over the

heads of their elected representatives, and attempts to sow division between

Western Governments; as well as by clandestine efforts to influence Western public

opinion. All this is backed up by the potentially intimidating threat of the vast

might of Soviet arms. Elsewhere, the concept has been put into practice by means

of Soviet support for insurrections and revolution in Asia, Africa, Central and

South America; and by direct invasion of Afghanistan.

16. So we return to the real questions raised by those who suggest that the West

could unilaterally reduce its armaments in safety. Are the Soviet Union&apos;s

intentions purely defensive? Is the strength of its nuclear and conventional forces

merely over-insurance? Even if the answer to these questions were positive beyond

a doubt, could we be certain that the Soviet Union would in future refrain from

pursuing its own security at the expense of others&apos;? Or that Soviet leaders would

not attempt to use Soviet military potential to exercise political domination over a

weakened and demoralised Western Europe? Or is there sufficient evidence to the

contrary to give us pause for thought?

17. As we have sought to show, the combination of vast Soviet military might,

together with a history of expansion and an adversarial ideology, must place on

those who would take Soviet assurances on trust the burden of proof in demonstrat-

ing that the Soviet Union&apos;s intentions towards the West are - and will remain - as

peaceful as its new leaders would wish us to believe. There is enough in this

combination of factors to raise legitimate questions about how the Soviet Union

might behave if it were not deterred by Western capability and will to resist any

aggression. In the absence of unmistakable evidence of a change in long-term

Soviet objectives - evidence that has not yet been forthcoming - a prudent policy

for the West must remain one of caution.

18. At the same time, we must be ready to engage in dialogue with the Soviet

Union to establish what scope Soviet policies allow for progress in East-West

relations. And we must be prepared to respond to signs of change, as well as to

opportunities for achieving serious arms control measures that will enhance

security and stability, and so help to bring about the improvement in East-West

relations that we all desire.

CHAPTER TWO : ARMS CONTROL

201. The search for balanced and verifiable arms control agreements, which

provide for security at lower levels of weapons, is a central element of our security

policy. This chapter chronicles significant developments during the last year,

which has seen major advances in a number of areas, not least at the October

summit in Reykjavik between the leaders of the two superpowers (see paragraphs

[205-208]). Clear priorities for the pursuit of arms control were subsequently set

by the Prime Minister and President Reagan at Camp David in November; these are

described in paragraph [209].

NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL

US-Soviet Negotiations

202. In the strategic area the United States, with the full support of the United

Kingdom and the NATO allies, has continued to seek deep cuts in US and Soviet

arsenals. To that end, in November 1985 the US Administration had tabled

proposals for 50% cuts. Notwithstanding Mr Gorbachev&apos;s proposal in January 1986

for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2000, these stayed

unanswered until June, when the Soviet Union made proposals for cuts of

approximately 30%, conditional on: tight new constraints on the US Strategic

Defence Initiative (SDI); an extension of the period of notice of withdrawal from

the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty to 15 years; and constraints on US forces

based in Europe. Although aspects of the Soviet proposals were unacceptable, they

did include one positive advance, in moving away from the previous one-sided

definition of the strategic weapons to be covered.

203. In July 1986, President Reagan responded with a letter to Mr Gorbachev in

which he made clear that, while the United States would prefer 50% reductions in

strategic weapons, lesser reductions could also be accepted as an interim step. In

September, the United States accordingly tabled further detailed proposals at

Geneva.

204. There was also movement on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF). The

US proposal in February 1986 had sought a phased elimination of long-range INF

(LRINF) missiles; while previous proposals for an interim agreement, some missiles

being retained by each side, remained on the table.   In September 1986 Soviet

negotiators indicated interest in an interim agreement that would leave 100 missile

warheads on each side in Europe. This offered some hope of further progress

towards an agreement embodying the Alliance goals of equal global ceilings for US

and Soviet systems.

205. These developments were taken significantly further at the meeting in

Reykjavik between President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev. For some time attention

had focused on the prospects for a second US-Soviet summit meeting, which at the

1985 (Geneva) summit it had been agreed should be held in the United States. The

two leaders eventually decided in late September, at short notice, to meet at

Reykjavik on October 11-12.

206. This meeting was not initially intended to negotiate major arms control

agreements. But in the event substantial progress was made on strategic, INF and

other issues. In the strategic arms group, the two sides reached provisional

agreement on 50% cuts leading to equal ceilings of 1,600 strategic nuclear delivery

vehicles and 6,000 warheads; and the Soviet Union agreed to cuts in its heavy

intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union tabled a proposal for the

elimination of all strategic nuclear weapons within ten years; the United States

responded with a proposal linking the elimination of all offensive ballistic missiles

to a ten-year non-withdrawal period from the ABM Treaty. In addition, the two

sides moved &apos;closer together on the outline of an INF agreement, involving zero

deployments of LRINF missiles in Europe, and 100 warheads on each side elsewhere

- the Soviet missiles to be stationed in Soviet Asia and the American missiles in the

continental United States.

207. A major stumbling-block to agreement on reductions in both INF and

strategic systems was, however, Soviet insistence on a linkage to SDI research

programmes, as a condition for agreement. The Soviet Union sought severe new

constraints on the SDI, while the scope of its own activities in this area remained

still unacknowledged. President Reagan made clear that he was not prepared to

accept such constraints, although he would agree to the extension of the with-

drawal period of the ABM Treaty for up to ten years while reductions in strategic

weapons took place. The Soviet side also sought to impose a new linkage to

agreement on nuclear testing issues. Because of Soviet insistence on these linkages

- even as regards INF, which the Soviet Union had previously stated could be

settled independently - it was not possible to reach agreement. In February of this

year, in the face of Western refusal to accept this illogical linkage, the Soviet

Union finally accepted the US offer to negotiate a separate agreement on INF.

The United Kingdom has welcomed this step, and we hope that the Soviet Union

will address the remaining issues constructively, including verification.

208. One particular issue that remained unresolved at Reykjavik was the

question of constraints on shorter-range INF missiles (SRINF) (of 150km to 1,000km

range). It had long been part of NATO&apos;s position that any INF agreement would

need to include adequate constraints on Soviet Scaleboard (SS-22) and SS-23 SRINF

missiles, which could otherwise undercut an INF agreement on cruise, Pershing II

and SS-20 missiles. It is also important that an INF agreement is followed by

negotiations aimed at addressing the imbalance in SRINF forces, and at dealing

further with LRINF. We are discussing with our allies how these should be handled.

The Soviet Union&apos;s position on SRINF is unclear, although it has indicated

willingness to freeze missiles in Europe with ranges below 1,000 km and thereafter

to discuss reductions below present numbers.

Camp David Meeting

209. Following the Reykjavik summit, the Prime Minister met President Reagan

at Camp David in November to discuss the way forward. They agreed that:

priority in the search for arms control agreements should be given to:

an INF agreement with restraints on shorter-range systems;

a 50% cut in US and Soviet strategic offensive weapons; and

a ban on chemical weapons;

in all three cases effective verification would be an essential

element;

NATO strategy would continue to need effective nuclear deterrence,

based on a mix of systems, and reductions in nuclear weapons would

increase the importance of eliminating conventional disparities;

nuclear weapons could not be dealt with in isolation, given the need

for a stable balance at all times;

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

the SDI research programme which is permitted by the ABM Treaty

should continue; and

these matters should continue to be subject to close consultation

within the Alliance.

The President also reaffirmed that the United States was proceeding with its

strategic modernisation programme, including Trident, and confirmed his full

support for the British acquisition of the system. The priorities agreed at that

meeting were endorsed by the Ministerial meetings of the Eurogroup and of NATO&apos;s

Defence Planning Committee and North Atlantic Council in December 1986. They

reflect a considered view on the most practical possibilities for progress.

The British and French Deterrents

210. Throughout the last year the United Kingdom and the NATO allies had con-

tinued to insist that they would not accept Soviet attempts to involve the British

and French national deterrents in the Geneva negotiations. The condition was,

however, dropped by Mr Gorbachev at his press conference at Reykjavik, when he

said:

&apos;We decided today......to withdraw completely the question of French and

British missiles in general, to leave it to one side. And let them remain as

an independent force, let them increase and be further improved.&apos;

211. This was a welcome step. Alliance cohesion had revealed the Soviet condi-

tion for the tactical ploy it always was. The Soviet acknowledgement of this will

have helped the negotiations to concentrate on the most important priority -

reductions in US and Soviet arsenals, which far outweigh the United Kingdom&apos;s

minimum deterrent, or that of France. The Government has, however, made clear

that our conditions for involving the British deterrent in arms control remain

unchanged: if US and Soviet strategic arsenals were to be very substantially

reduced, and no significant change had occurred in Soviet defensive capabilities,

Britain would review its position and consider how best to contribute to arms

control in the light of the reduced threat.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Nuclear Testing

212. While our first priority is reductions in nuclear weapons, the United

Kingdom remains committed to progress towards a Comprehensive Test Ban (CTB).

Despite many claims to the contrary, important verification problems remain

unresolved, and the United Kingdom is working for their resolution at the Geneva

Conference on Disarmament.

213. A CTB is clearly not a near-term prospect. Nonetheless, more limited

steps are possible, and some welcome progress was made during the year. After a

series of US invitations for Soviet observers to inspect a US test, so as to improve

verification techniques, the two superpowers began a series of bilateral discussions

on verification issues. In September, President Reagan outlined at the United

Nations General Assembly the proposals he had put to the Soviet Union. These

were that: the United States was ready to move forward on the ratification of the

threshold nuclear testing treaties signed in the 1970s, and would put them into

effect once agreement had been reached on improved verification techniques; and

that the two sides would then go on to discuss a step-by-step programme of further

limiting nuclear tests, in association with the reduction of nuclear weapons. The

United Kingdom has very much welcomed this practical approach to constraints on

testing. President Reagan has now taken the first step in this process by

requesting the US Senate&apos;s advice and consent to the ratification of the threshold

treaties, subject to the verification improvements referred to above.

214. The Soviet Union continued with its announced moratorium on nuclear

testing for most of the year, declaring its end with a test in February 1987. It also

continued with its advocacy of an immediate CTB, while refusing to accept the

practical proposals put forward by the West to help resolve the verification issues.

At Reykjavik Soviet leaders appeared to endorse the US proposal for a step-by-step

approach; subsequently, however, they moved back from this position and proposed

simultaneous negotiations on all elements in the US phased approach, including

immediate negotiation of the CTB. We hope that Soviet leaders will re-confirm

their acceptance of the step-by-step approach and agree to practical steps to

follow it up.

SDI

215. Early this year the United States opened discussions with the United

Kingdom and the other NATO allies on the future of SDI, and, in particular,

whether it should be carried out within the broad, rather than the narrow,

interpretation of the ABM Treaty, and whether early development decisions needed

to be taken on some SDI research projects. Such a decision would have important

implications for the consideration of the future place of ballistic missile defences

in the strategic relationship, for arms control, and for the conduct of British

participation in SDI research (see paragraphs [524-528]). Allied consultations are

continuing.

CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND ARMS CONTROL

The Warsaw Pact Capability

1. The Warsaw Pact has the capability to conduct chemical warfare (CW)

against NATO forces on a very large scale, and produces and stockpiles a range of

lethal agents and incapacitants. The lethal agents currently produced and

stockpiled include nerve, blister, blood and choking agents. Research into new

agents continues, including in areas that will blur the distinction between chemical

and biological weapons. The Warsaw Pact has troops who specialise in CW, and the

ordinary Serviceman is trained in CW doctrine and tactics.

2. Warsaw Pact forces have various means of delivering chemical attacks by

land- and sea-based systems and from missiles and bombs. The variety of delivery

systems, together with the range both in type and persistency of chemical weapons,

would allow Warsaw Pact forces to use chemical weapons very flexibly.

The NATO Response

3. The United Kingdom gave up its CW capability in the late 1950s, and no

change to that policy is planned. Our research effort is now devoted entirely to

defensive and protective measures, to which all NATO allies attach considerable

importance. Given the Soviet capability, we place the highest priority on the

negotiation of a verifiable and comprehensive worldwide ban on chemical weapons.

The United States has produced no such weapons since 1969. We believe that the

United States&apos; moves towards modernising its limited retaliatory CW capability,

outlined in last year&apos;s Statement, will underline to the Soviet Union the benefits of

reaching early agreement on such a ban. Thus we supported NATO&apos;s adoption in

May 1986 of a Force Goal inviting the United States to modernise its chemical

weapon stocks with binary munitions. In the event that it is not possible to achieve

the ban we desire, modernisation of US chemical weapons would contribute to

upholding NATO&apos;s deterrent strategy of flexible response.

4. The US Government has said that it has no plans to base binary chemical

munitions in any foreign country in peacetime. We have not been approached about

the possible contingency deployment of chemical weapons specifically to this

country, and we have made clear that, if such a request were ever to be received,

6

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

it would be a matter for decision by the Government of the day, in the light of all

the circumstances prevailing at the time. Any deployment of chemical weapons to

the United Kingdom at any time would require the consent of the British

Government.

Progress towards a Ban

5. The past year has seen good progress in the Conference on Disarmament in

Geneva towards negotiating a ban on the production, stockpiling and deployment of

chemical weapons. The United Kingdom held the chairmanship of the Ad Hoc

Committee on chemical weapons for the 1986 session. The talks gathered

momentum during the session, and agreement on some aspects of the Convention

was achieved. As with other arms control agreements, provisions for verification

will be the key to an effective chemical weapons convention. The 1986 session saw

movement on some aspects of verification. Agreement in principle was reached on

inspection of the destruction of chemical weapon stockpiles and on inspection of

production facilities, as well as of the civil chemical industry. A major outstanding

issue remains the question of arrangements for special inspection on challenge,

when one party believes that a breach of the Convention has occurred.

6. In an attempt to unblock this impasse, the United Kingdom last July

launched an important initiative on &apos;challenge inspection&apos;. The British proposals

require the state that is challenged to demonstrate that it is complying with its

obligations within a specified timescale. These proposals are now under discussion.

7. The need for a comprehensive global ban on chemical weapons has been

reinforced by evidence of their use by Iraq in the war with Iran. The British

Government, in an attempt to make proliferation more difficult, has imposed

export controls on a range of chemicals; and in addition has issued an extensive

warning list of chemicals to assist British industry in detecting any orders that may

potentially be misused for the production of chemical weapons. Although these

measures help to reduce the risk of proliferation, we firmly believe that a global,

verifiable and comprehensive ban on chemical weapons is the only real solution.

CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL

216. Progress in nuclear disarmament increases the importance of achieving

matching progress in the area of conventional forces, where the balance, as Annex

A shows, is very much in favour of the Warsaw Pact - a central fact that the

Warsaw Pact&apos;s Budapest Appeal, issued on 11 June 1986, ignored in proposing equal

reductions by each Alliance. On 11 December NATO Foreign Ministers issued the

Brussels Declaration, based on the report of the high level task force set up at the

meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Halifax the previous May. This calls for two

sets of distinct negotiations on conventional arms control in the whole of Europe

from the Atlantic to the Urals: one set to build on and expand the Confidence- and

CONFIDENTIAL

Security-Building Measures agreed in Stockholm in September (see [below]); and the

other focusing on the conventional forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact from the

Atlantic to the Urals.

217. The Brussels Declaration notes that, for such negotiations to succeed,

there must be recognition of the facts and common understandings on objectives

and methods. The objectives should be:

the establishment of a stable and secure level of forces, geared to

the elimination of disparities;

a negotiating process that proceeds step by step, and which guaran-

tees the undiminished security of all concerned at each stage;

to focus on the elimination of the capability for surprise attack and

initiation of large-scale offensive action;

measures to build confidence;

application to the whole of Europe, taking account of regional

imbalances; and

an effective verification regime.

The Brussels Declaration demonstrates NATO&apos;s commitment to conventional arms

control in Europe, and provides an opportunity and a basis for progress in

establishing stability at lower levels of forces. Contacts between representatives

of NATO and Warsaw Pact countries on a mandate for these negotiations began on

17 February in Vienna.

218. Meanwhile, at the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR) talks in

Vienna, we and our NATO allies continue to seek an agreement on reduced levels of

forces in Central Europe. The Western proposal, tabled in December 1985 by the

United Kingdom, was designed to offer a constructive way forward. In particular,

to meet Eastern objections the West proposed, as an important concession, that

agreement on the current size of either side&apos;s forces - for long the major

stumbling-block to progress - be deferred while an initial reduction in US and

Soviet forces was made. So far the East has failed to respond seriously.

CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES

1. Creating a basis of trust between East and West is just as important as

securing arms control agreements. We cannot achieve real security so long as

either side lacks confidence in the other, or the risk of war through accident or

misunderstanding exists. That is why NATO attaches importance to the process

launched by the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)

in 1975, and subsequently in the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament in Europe

(CDE), described in Figure 3.

2. An important achievement last September was agreement in CDE on a

substantial package of Confidence- and Security-Building Measures. This accord,

known as the Stockholm Document, is the first major arms control agreement since

SALT II was signed in 1979. It promises to bring a greater degree of openness and

predictability to military activities in the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the

Urals, thereby reducing tension, mistrust and the risk of military confrontation

through accident or misunderstanding. Its most significant elements are:

notification, 42 days in advance, of military activities in Europe from

the Atlantic to the Urals involving at least 13,000 troops or 300

tanks. Amphibious or airborne activities involving at least 3,000

troops to be similarly notified;

observers from all 35 CSCE states to be invited to all notifiable

activities involving at least 17,000 land forces, or at least 5,000

amphibious or airborne troops;

the exchange by 15 November each year of annual calendars of

notifiable military activities expected to take place during the

following year. Signatory states have agreed that exercises involving

at least 40,000 personnel must be included in these calendars, other-

wise they will not be permitted;

inspection arrangements giving each participating state the right to

conduct inspections on the territory of other participating states if

there should be doubts about compliance.

The accord came into force on 1 January this year and represents an important

political commitment by all 35 participating states. Its success will depend,

however, on its being implemented fully in the spirit of that commitment.

3. The latest of the CSCE Follow-up Meetings opened in Vienna on 4

November 1986. The 35 participating states have formally reviewed their records

of compliance with the Helsinki Final Act and Madrid Concluding Document, and

are considering ways in which the CSCE process might be developed in future. The

British Government&apos;s aim is to press the East for real progress on compliance,

especially on human rights commitments, and to seek balanced progress between

the military, security, political, economic and human dimensions of the process.

219. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 represents an important inter-

national commitment to the elimination of this horrendous form of warfare. The

Second Review Conference of the Convention was held in Geneva in September

1986. It ended successfully, with the unanimous adoption of a series of confidence-

building measures that strengthened the authority of the Convention.

  ARMS CONTROL FORA

1.     Nuclear and Space Talks (NST)

US-Soviet negotiations on nuclear and

space arms control opened in Geneva in March

1985. Their agreed aim is to work out effective

arrangements for preventing an arms race in space

and terminating it on earth; for limiting and

reducing nuclear aims; and for strengthening

strategic stability. Thu negotiations are divided into

three groups: on space and defence; strategic

arms; and intermediale-range nuclear forces (INF).

2.    Conference on Disarmament (CD)

CD meets in Geneva under the auspices of

the United Nations. 40 nations participate (and

were listed in last year&apos;s Statement). The Con-

ference covers a wide range of arms control issues,

of which the most important involves negotiations

on a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. The CD

reports annually to the General Assembly of the

Uniled Nations.

3.     Mutual and Balanced Force

Reductions (MBFR)

These talks began in Vienna in 1973. Their

aim is &apos;to contribute towards a more stable

relationship and to the strengthening of peace and

security in Europe by the mutual reduction of

armed forces and armaments and associated

measures in Central Europe&apos;   an area defined as

East and West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands

and tuxembourg, Poland and Czechoslovakia. The

direct participants in the talks are those countries

(excluding France) that have forces in this area  

the United States, Britain, Canada, the Federal

Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands,

Luxembourg, the Soviet Union, the German

Democratic Republic, Poland and Czechoslovakia

(but other members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact

are indirect participants&apos;).

4.    Conference on Security and

Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)

Mooting in Helsinki in 1975 this conference

agreed what has become known us the Helsinki

Final Act, under which participants accepted

obligations covering security, polilical, economic

and humanitarian issues. Compliance with the

Final Act, and subsequently with the Madrid Con-

cluding Document, has been reviewed at Follow-up

Meetings in Belgrade (1977-78); Madrid (1980-

83); and Vienna (which began in November 1986

and is still under way).

Tlio 35 participating states are all European

cuunlrios, except Albania, plus lliu United States

anil Canada.

5.     Conference on Disarmament

in Europe (CDE)

CDE opened in Stockholm in January 1984

with the same 35-nation membership as CSCE. Its

mandate, given by the Madrid CSCE Follow-up

Meeting, was to extend the scope of security

obligations under the Helsinki Final Act and thus to

reduce still further the risk of war, by agreeing

Confidence- and Security-Building Measures that

were militarily significant, politically binding, verifi-

able and covered all Europe from the Atlantic to the

Urals. Agreement was reached in September

1986.

ESSAY

NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NATO STRATEGY

1. The basic principle at the heart of NATO strategy, supported for nearly 40

years by all members of the North Atlantic Alliance, has been nuclear deterrence.

At once simple and yet paradoxical, it is based on the idea that the surest way to

preserve peace between East and West, without jeopardising the freedom of our

peoples, is to face a potential aggressor with a clear risk that the costs of

aggression would amply outweigh any conceivable gain; and that the use of force is

hence no longer a rational option. Thus, the purpose of NATO&apos;s possession of

nuclear forces is to ensure that circumstances never arise when we might have to

consider using them.

2. NATO could not achieve such deterrence by conventional weapons alone. An

adversary who no longer faced the risk of nuclear retaliation might once again

regard force as a usable option, since the costs of aggression might no longer

appear prohibitively high. Moreover, a defence based solely on conventional

weapons would have no prospect of success against a nuclear-armed adversary. For

it would always be open to an adversary who retained his nuclear weapons to use

them, or threaten their use, to overcome any conventional resistance. Indeed, the

more successful the conventional defence, the greater the incentive might be for a

nuclear-armed power to resort to nuclear weapons. NATO&apos;s one-sided

abandonment of such weapons might therefore increase the risk not merely of

conventional war but also of nuclear use against NATO.

3. In 1987 it is easy to forget that in the first half of this century the world was

twice plunged into immensely destructive global conventional war, precipitated on

both occasions by a state numerically weaker than the combination of states that

faced it. In the last century Europe was torn asunder by several major wars. By

contrast, in the 40 years since the end of the Second World War - 40 years of

nuclear deterrence - there has been no war in Western Europe, either conventional

or nuclear, in spite of deep ideological hostility between East and West. This is a

striking achievement, which those opposed to nuclear weapons, whether on moral

or other grounds, would do well to ponder. They must explain how it is morally

preferable to make Europe once again &apos;safe&apos; for conventional war - a war in which

modern weapons could bring destruction on a scale never seen before, and which

could in the end provoke the very use of nuclear weapons that they seek to avoid.

k. Nuclear weapons on their own are not, however, sufficient for a credible

deterrence strategy. Indeed the nature and scope of the nuclear component of the

Alliance&apos;s deterrence forces have varied over time. In the early 1950s, faced with

massive conventional forces in Eastern Europe, the NATO countries relied princi-

pally on the ability of the United States to inflict a massive nuclear strike on the

Soviet Union. But the growth of the Soviet nuclear arsenal in the late 1950s and

1960s - and in particular the Soviet acquisition of long-range nuclear weapons

capable of striking the United States - meant that NATO needed to widen its

options for responding to either a conventional or a nuclear attack. So NATO

evolved in the 1960s a new strategy of &apos;flexible response&apos;; and this remains its

strategy today.

5. For the strategy to work requires the existence of the US nuclear guarantee,

backed by a strong US conventional presence in Europe. But it is a fundamental

principle of the Alliance that the risks and benefits of a collective security policy

be fully shared. In the nuclear field, concrete expression is given to this by the

direct participation of European nations in the provision of the Alliance&apos;s deterrent

forces. Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands,

Turkey and the United Kingdom, all provide delivery systems and units trained in

nuclear operations for the delivery of weapons that remain under US custodial

control. Among these are dual-capable aircraft and artillery, and nuclear-

dedicated systems such as Lance and Pershing missiles. The United Kingdom also

assigns all its own nuclear forces to the Alliance, including both our strategic

deterrent and theatre air-delivered weapons for aircraft and ship-borne anti-

submarine helicopters. In addition, Alliance nations provide base facilities for US

nuclear-delivery units, which are part of US forces in Europe. These include bases

for US Poseidon submarines and the US Air Force in the United Kingdom, and US

Air Force and Army units in the Central and Southern Regions of Allied Command

Europe.

6. For a country to reject NATO nuclear strategy, while continuing (as NATO

membership implies) to accept US nuclear protection through the Alliance, offers

no moral merit. Nor would it offer the United Kingdom greater safety, for

whether nuclear weapons are based here or not, our country&apos;s size and location

2

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

make it militarily crucial to NATO and so an attractive target in war. A &apos;nuclear

free&apos; Britain would mean a weaker NATO, weaker deterrence, and a greater risk of

war; and if war broke out we would if anything be more likely, not less, to come

under nuclear attack.

7. To implement a strategy of nuclear deterrence, NATO has to maintain an

effective stockpile of nuclear weapons. But deterrence does not require ever-

increasing numbers of such weapons. On the contrary, NATO is firmly committed

to deploying only enough nuclear weapons to ensure deterrence, while at the same

time seeking to negotiate deep reductions in the stockpiles of both sides.

8. This was demonstrated by the decision of NATO Ministers in October 1983 at

Montebello to withdraw 1,400 warheads from the land-based nuclear stockpile in

Western Europe in the period up to the end of 1988. The decision, taken together

with the withdrawal of 1,000 warheads that had already taken place before October

1983, brought the total number of warheads to be removed from Europe since 1979

to 2,400. Furthermore, one existing warhead is being removed for each Pershing II

or cruise missile deployed to Western Europe, so that such deployment results in no

further net increase. Critics of this decision have argued that it is of little import,

since the warheads withdrawn were in any event obsolescent. This is not only

untrue - many of the weapons being withdrawn are still very effective - but misses

the point: for NATO might have decided to retain a larger stockpile and

subsequently to replace these weapons with equal numbers of modernised versions.

9. This reduction by NATO was unreciprocated by the Warsaw Pact. Deterrence

could be assured at lower levels of armaments provided the Soviet Union were

prepared to reduce, too, so that there were balance between the two sides and both

were assured of their own security. For many years the search for balanced, equit-

able and verifiable measures of arms control has been a slow one; but over the past

12 months real progress has been made, as we describe in Chapter 2.

10. As we record there, however, nuclear weapons cannot be treated in isolation.

It is also necessary to consider the wider balance of forces between East and West

and the Warsaw Pact&apos;s massive superiority in chemical and conventional weapons.

The ever-increasing strength of these Soviet armaments casts a shadow over

Western Europe. Reductions in nuclear weapons increase the importance of

eliminating these other disparities and ensuring a stable overall balance. But as

long as the basic tensions between East and West are undiminished, NATO will need

to continue to rely on a strategy of nuclear deterrence based on an effective mix

of systems. Nuclear weapons will remain as vital for keeping the peace - for

preventing conventional as well as nuclear war in Europe - as they have been for

the past 40 years.

CHAPTER THREE : BRITISH DEFENCE POLICY

THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE

301. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is the foundation of this country&apos;s

defence and security policy. Indeed, we are convinced that this Alliance of 16

sovereign states, each freely a signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty, remains the

only realistic way of providing for our defence. NATO&apos;s deterrence policy is

encapsulated in the strategy of forward defence and flexible response. This

strategy threatens no-one: NATO leaders have made clear that none of our

weapons will ever be used except in response to an attack. Our primary aim

remains the prevention of war; our secondary aim, should war occur, is to respond

at the appropriate level to stop the aggressor in his attack and make him withdraw.

We believe that this strategy is still serving us well.

302. It is towards maintaining the Alliance&apos;s ability to deter war that our

defence effort is directed. Our contribution to NATO accounts, directly or

indirectly, for more than 95% of our defence budget. The vast majority of our

forces are committed to one or other of the three major NATO commands -Europe,

Atlantic and Channel. The United Kingdom remains the only European NATO

member to contribute to all three elements - strategic nuclear, theatre nuclear and

conventional - of NATO&apos;s triad of forces. We are determined to continue making a

full political and military contribution to the Alliance.

303. Our four main roles in NATO are:

the provision of nuclear forces, including the maintenance of an inde-

pendent strategic nuclear deterrent;

defence of the United Kingdom itself, our homeland and a vital

support base for the Alliance;

land and air forces based in Europe and contributing to forward

defence, together with the capability for massive reinforcement from the

United Kingdom if required; and

1

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

maritime forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas, and

contributing to forward defence in the Norwegian Sea.

We also contribute specialist reinforcements with deployment options mainly on

NATO&apos;s Northern Flank, which is of particular strategic importance for the United

Kingdom. Some of the reinforcements that we provide for NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied

Commander Europe (SACEUR) do, however, also have deployment options in the

Southern Region of the Alliance. In addition, on the Southern Flank, the United

Kingdom contributes to NATO&apos;s ability to control the strategically important

Gibraltar Strait. British forces are based there for the defence of Gibraltar itself,

and the Rock provides facilities for exercising in the region and naval and maritime

air headquarters, which form part of the NATO command structure in the

Mediterranean.

304. This country also retains important defence responsibilities and interests

outside the NATO area. These are described on page [ ].

The European Pillar

305. Successive Statements on the Defence Estimates have used the analogy of

twin pillars, European and North American, supporting a transatlantic bridge to

illustrate how the Alliance depends on the partnership of the Old World and the

New. To weaken either pillar would endanger the whole structure of deterrence on

which our security is based. After a year in which voices have again been raised

questioning the US presence in Europe, the paramount importance of maintaining

the North American commitment to the Alliance is discussed on page [ ].

306. As we explain there, there can be no substitute for the contribution made

to collective security by the presence of substantial US and Canadian forces in

Europe. But the contribution made by the European members of the Alliance is

also substantial and contributes significantly to the collective defence; it can be

further strengthened by greater cooperation between us. The United Kingdom is

therefore committed to the maintenance and development of bilateral relations

with our European allies, and to playing a major part in the work of the main

multilateral organisations devoted to European security cooperation and equipment

collaboration.

307. The Eurogroup&apos;s collaborative sub-groups aim to concert members&apos; policies

and practices, at the working level, in the fields of logistics, communications,

training, medicine and long-term operational concepts. The group also does

valuable work in the United States to publicise the extent of European defence

efforts. The six-monthly meetings of Eurogroup Defence Ministers both direct this

work and provide an opportunity for informal discussion of defence issues. In

October 1986, experts met in Odense to explore the difficulties faced in the

management of defence budgets and ways of making better use of available

resources. Eurogroup Ministers agreed last December that this work should be

pursued.

THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION

1. The Western European Union (WEU) is founded in the revised Brussels Treaty

of 1954, at the heart of which is the commitment in Article V whereby the

signatories undertake to afford one another &apos;all the military and other aid in their

power&apos; should one of them be &apos;the object of an armed attack in Europe&apos;. It is under

the Brussels Treaty that the British Government maintains an army and air force

on the continent of Europe in peacetime, an obligation that is historically unique.

The Treaty thus embodies the United Kingdom&apos;s fundamental commitment to a

collective security together with our partners, yet is set firmly within the

framework of the Atlantic Alliance. The WEU thereby makes an important

contribution to strengthening the European pillar of the Alliance.

2. Since its reactivation in 1984, the WEU has been the only European

organisation in which both Defence and Foreign Ministers of the seven member

countries (Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,

the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) can meet to discuss defence and security

issues of significance to Western Europe. The aim of these discussions is to

stimulate clearer understanding of European security needs. But the WEU is not an

operational forum, nor one in which collective decisions are reached. In its

activities, it seeks to reinforce rather than duplicate work done in NATO, and to

ensure that the European input into the Alliance is coordinated and coherent.

3. WEU Ministers met twice during 1986, in April and November at Venice and

Luxembourg; their Luxembourg meeting presented a particularly useful opportunity

to discuss issues of specific concern to Europe raised by the meeting between

President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev at Reykjavik. They have also examined the

progress made in WEU reactivation, and agreed that the organisation in its present

re-structured form should run unhindered until the end of this year. They will then

undertake a review with the object of sign-posting the way ahead. The aim should

be to get the WEU established as a focal point of the European security identity

and to ensure that its working methods are soundly based for this purpose.

4. Meanwhile, another important aspect of the WEU is its Assembly, which

comprises representatives from the national Parliaments of WEU member

countries. It is the only European Parliamentary body specifically empowered by

Treaty to debate defence and security questions. As such, it has unique

possibilities for stimulating informed debate, and for generating better public

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

understanding of the issues involved. Through dialogue with the Assembly,

Governments&apos; views can become more widely known and form an essential element

of the debate. The Assembly will be important to the future of the WEU and of

European security cooperation.

308. Equipment collaboration is an increasingly important aspect of efforts to

strengthen NATO&apos;s European pillar. Defence equipment is expensive, and colla-

boration can help to share development costs and avoid wasteful duplication of

effort; lower unit costs may make it possible to deploy a greater total number of

equipments. Collaboration also helps to achieve standardisation and inter-

operability. The Independent European Programme Group (IEPG) seeks to make

better use of the resources that members devote to defence procurement, and its

progress during the past few years provides further tangible evidence of the

European countries&apos; willingness to work effectively together. Further details of

progress in equipment collaboration, including the work of the IEPG, are given in

Chapter 5.

309. We shall press on with our efforts in these fora. For we believe that a

more cohesive Europe will be able to make a contribution to the Alliance that is

far greater than the sum total of individual European contributions.

NATO DEFENCE PLANNING

Conventional Force Planning

310. A prerequisite of maintaining effective deterrent forces is successful

forward planning. NATO has a highly developed and effective biennial defence

planning process, which involves the Defence Ministers of all the countries

participating in the integrated military structure. The purpose of this process is

both to encourage nations to develop their national plans in directions beneficial to

the Alliance as a whole, and to monitor the progress made by nations in meeting

agreed Alliance goals.

311. These goals are developed every two years by the Major NATO

Commanders on the basis of Guidance issued by Ministers (also biennially, in odd-

numbered years), which sets out the political, economic, military and technological

factors that could affect the development of NATO forces and their impact on

NATO strategy. The goals are adopted by the Defence Planning Committee (DPC)

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

in the May of even-numbered years. Thus last May the DPC adopted Force Goals

for the period 1987-92 based on Ministerial Guidance 1985. Member nations pro-

vided their first response to these Goals, recording their progress in implementing

them, last autumn in reply to the annual Defence Planning Questionnaire. These

responses were collated into a NATO five-year forward plan, which was considered

by Ministers at the December 1986 DPC meeting. This May, Ministers will approve

Ministerial Guidance 87, on which major NATO Commanders will base the

development of their Force Goals for the period 1989-94, and which nations should

use as a yardstick for constructing their forward programmes and plans.

312. For the past two years, NATO has devoted considerable effort to the Con-

ventional Defence Improvements (CDI) exercise, described in greater detail

[below]. One important aspect of this work has been the continuing development of

a longer-term perspective, with a view to providing a coherent and coordinated

framework looking up to 20 years ahead, within which national and international

planning staffs can operate. For example, this year&apos;s Ministerial Guidance will

draw on the Conceptual Military Framework developed by NATO&apos;s military

authorities and provide improved guidance that looks further ahead. This will help

to ensure that national planners receive guidance on NATO&apos;s military requirements

at a stage when it can influence national planning of major new equipments.

CONVENTIONAL DEFENCE IMPROVEMENTS (CDI)

1. Ministers attending the NATO Defence Planning Committee (DPC) meeting

in December 1984 called for proposals to improve NATO&apos;s conventional defence

posture so as to address the imbalance of forces favouring the Warsaw Pact, and to

avoid being put in a position of undue reliance on the early use of nuclear weapons.

In response to this mandate, a report was put to Ministers at the DPC in May 1985.

This identified key deficiencies in the Alliance&apos;s conventional capability and

allowed Ministers to set work in hand in those areas where a special effort would

provide the greatest return for our collective defence. This is a vital aspect of the

CDI exercise: it aims to improve the credibility of NATO&apos;s conventional forces by

the careful and selective use of the substantial resources that individual nations

devote to defence.

2. The CDI exercise is not a radical departure from traditional Alliance

policy. It builds on the considerable progress made during the late 1970s and early

1980s in improving allied conventional capabilities through greater sustainability,

improved readiness, better training and additional funding for common infra-

structure projects.

3. The exercise is, however, an indication of the collective Alliance deter-

mination to maintain strong conventional forces and to come to grips with the

5

CONFIDENTIAL

rising real costs of equipment. In essence, it seeks greater focusing of national

plans on collective Alliance needs; clearer military priorities; improvements in

coordination between different planning areas; and greater emphasis on longer-

term planning. As such, it was not intended to produce dramatic results quickly;

sustained efforts will be necessary.

4. Steady progress is already being made in the field of force planning. The

Force Goals for the period 1987-92, which were adopted by the DPC in May 1986,

reflected priorities identified in the CDI exercise. Nations&apos; responses to these

force goals were considered by Ministers in the course of their Annual Defence

Review at last December&apos;s DPC meeting. Ministers noted that considerable

progress had been made towards a more effective conventional posture and

expressed their determination to sustain the momentum of the exercise. Our own

national equipment plans are well directed towards CDI highlighted areas.

Nuclear Planning

313. The nuclear component of the deterrent forces available to the Alliance

receives special handling within the organisation. This is for a number of reasons:

the special political sensitivity of nuclear issues, the special nature of the weapons

themselves, and the recognition that, while there are only two nuclear weapon

states participating in the integrated military structure, there is a need for broad

Alliance cooperation and participation in the nuclear field. Out of this has grown

NATO&apos;s Nuclear Planning Group (NPG).

314. Like the DPC, the NPG meets at both ministerial and ambassadorial level ;

the Ministerial meeting in October 1986 was held at Gleneagles in Scotland. The

Group fulfils the need for a forum in which all concerned with NATO&apos;s defence

policy and planning can pursue fundamental questions, such as how many and what

type of nuclear weapons are needed to maintain deterrence, how they should be

deployed, what procedures are required to give effect to proper participation and

consultation, and so on. Such a forum also provides the opportunity for Alliance

nations who do not have their own nuclear weapons to discuss with the nuclear

weapons states the issues they must confront in planning their own, and the

Alliance&apos;s, forces, including issues such as force modernisation, testing, and nuclear

safety and security, and the vital question of nuclear arms control.

ESSAY

THE AMERICAN PILLAR

&quot;No-one of my generation can forget that America has been the principal architect

of a peace in Europe which has lasted 40 years. Given this shield of the United

States, we have been granted the opportunities to build a concept of Europe beyond

the dreams of our fathers: a Europe which seemed unattainable amid the mud and

slaughter of the First World War and the suffering and sacrifice of the Second.&quot;

The Prime Minister.

Speech to a joint session

of the US Congress, 20 February 1985

1. These words reflect the views of a generation of people, few of whom would

question the paramount importance of the transatlantic alliance that was forged in

the years following the Second World War. But today, more than 40 years on from

the war, Europe has changed beyond recognition: a new generation has grown up

which has known only peace and prosperity, and for whom the war and its

immediate aftermath are a matter of history. So it is appropriate to consider here

the foundations on which the transatlantic partnership were based and their

relevance for today&apos;s world.

2. The roots of the relationship between Europe and America run deep. The

majority of North Americans have their origins in this continent; personal ties, and

ties of history, language and culture are strong. The economic links between the

two sides of the Atlantic are extensive. Above all, Western Europe and America

share the same political and social values, not least among them a deep commit-

ment to the principles of democracy and freedom - a commitment that was well

demonstrated during the last war, when those principles came under the fiercest

attack ever, from Hitler&apos;s totalitarian Nazism. North America&apos;s military interven-

tion at that time made it possible to restore the freedom of Western Europe.

3. In 1945 the United States might have withdrawn into isolation as it had done

in 1918. It did not because relations between the Western allies and the Soviet

Union deteriorated rapidly after the war, and the US Government recognised that

its primary strategic interest lay in helping to keep Western Europe free of Soviet

control.    A combination of idealism and enlightened self-interest led to an

1

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

American commitment to counter the threat of communism wherever it occurred

(the Truman Doctrine and the policy of &apos;containment&apos;) and to help the West

European Governments implement their plans for post-war economic recovery (the

European Recovery Programme, 1948-51). The continued Soviet military threat

and, particularly, the events surrounding the Berlin blockade encouraged the

Truman Administration, at the instigation of several West European countries, to

commit the United States - in the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 - to the defence

of Western Europe.

4. The relationship has changed considerably in the past 40 years. Europe and

the United States have drawn much closer together than they were before the last

war. The genuine friendship that already existed between the two sides of the

Atlantic has grown as personal contacts have increased. But we have not been

without disputes and disagreements in the Alliance during that time. Americans

have sometimes been irritated by the equivocation and confusion that has seemed

to surround the Europeans&apos; inability to &apos;get their act together&apos;, and by alleged

European unwillingness to do more to defend themselves. There have been debates

in Europe for some 25 years about the credibility of the US nuclear guarantee, and

about the willingness of Americans to keep their troops in Europe. From President

Eisenhower&apos;s day until now, there has been no lack of gloomy prophets on both sides

of the Atlantic predicting the imminent end of the Atlantic relationship.

5. Today there is a new wave of unease and criticism. But the picture has been

complicated by the fact that, to the traditional European anxiety about

maintaining the US commitment to Europe, have been added opposite European

voices who wish to see that commitment reduced.

6. Such questioning of the US presence in Europe requires an answer; for it

throws into doubt the very foundations on which the Alliance has been based for so

long. Behind it is often an implicit assumption that the Soviet Union no longer

poses any threat, military or otherwise, to the West - an assumption that has little

except wishful thinking to support it. In the first place, as we discuss on page [ ],

we cannot ignore the ideological hostility of the Soviet Union towards the West;

and secondly, the Soviet investment in military might, described in Annex A, has

2

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

-

increased enormously since the last war. Whatever Soviet intentions towards the

West might, or might not be, it would be the height of folly simply to rely on Soviet

goodwill towards us in such circumstances.

7. The American commitment to Western Europe is essential. NATO&apos;s defence

posture depends critically on the United States&apos; nuclear forces, together with its

theatre nuclear and conventional forces based in Europe. Without them we would

have no credible defence in the face of the massive Soviet nuclear, chemical and

conventional threat. Certainly a Europe-only option would not provide a credible

alternative, either in political or military terms.

8. The most visible proof of the American commitment is the 300,000 US

Servicemen and women stationed in Western Europe. Successive US Governments

have recognised that it is in Europe that the principal threat to the West lies, and

it is therefore here that most of NATO&apos;s forces need to be deployed. Although

Western Europe can rely on reinforcements from the United States these would

take time to arrive, and ready forces are also required to meet those forces that

the Soviet Union could bring quickly to bear in any conflict.

9. The presence of US forces here serves another purpose, too, by demonstrating

the solidarity of the NATO Alliance. This is important because it is ultimately on

Soviet perceptions of the strength and cohesion of the Alliance, and specifically

the inevitable involvement of the United States in any conflict in Europe, that the

success of NATO&apos;s strategy of deterrence depends. Evidence that the Soviet Union

recognises the key importance of this cohesion can be seen in the efforts to which

it has gone to divide Europe from the United States on such issues as the

deployment of intermediate-range nuclear weapons and, more recently, on the

Strategic Defence Initiative and arms control. Soviet efforts have failed, but not

for want of skilful attempts to exploit particular European concerns.

10. A criticism sometimes heard is that the British Government has no control

over US forces based in the United Kingdom. This is to ignore the understanding

reaffirmed by Mr Churchill and President Truman in January 1952, which provided

that use in an emergency of bases made available to the United States would be a

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

matter for joint decision by the two Governments in the light of the circumstances

prevailing at the time. The understanding covers the use of these bases by US

forces equipped with nuclear or conventional weapons.

11. It follows from the above that in the current international environment to

seek the withdrawal - or even partial withdrawal - of US forces from this country

would carry very grave risks. It would weaken the military posture of the Alliance

and send entirely the wrong signal to the Soviet Union about NATO cohesion and

solidarity. It would reduce the chances of achieving successful arms control

agreements with the Soviet Union. It would undermine the strategic link between

the United States and Europe and the credibility of the US strategic guarantee. It

would lead our allies to question our continuing commitment to the Alliance and to

the defence of Europe. It would fuel tendencies towards isolationism in the United

States and encourage other European members of NATO to follow suit. In sum, it

would be a wholly irresponsible move.

12. US forces are here because neither North America nor Western Europe could

carry the full burden of maintaining its own security alone. Thanks to the Alliance

we are able to achieve a level of deterrence that would otherwise be unattainable.

Together we can ensure that deterrence is maintained, that the burden remains

tolerable and that peace is preserved.

ESSAY

OUTSIDE THE NATO AREA

1. British defence policy is founded on the four major roles for which we

commit forces to NATO. But we do have an additional range of commitments and

activities, outside the NATO area, which are of quite a different type. They are

not, to begin with, concerned with direct threats to the security of the United

Kingdom: the forward defence of the Federal Republic of Germany may be the

forward defence of Britain itself, but the forward defence of Hong Kong or Belize

is not. Nor is our out-of-area policy primarily related to the threat from the

Soviet Union: none of our out-of-area garrisons is constituted with Soviet

aggression in mind, or even aggression by proxies of the Soviet Union. Why, then,

do we need an out-of-area capability?

2. First, because of our history: we were a world power, and we retain some

residual obligations dating from our imperial past. We are responsible for the

defence of 13 dependent territories, ranging from Hong Kong to Pitcairn Island, as

well as the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus. In addition, we have agreements with

a range of former colonies and Gulf states.

3. Secondly, many thousands of British citizens are resident abroad. While their

safety is primarily the responsibility of the Government of the country concerned,

not all Governments are always in a position to protect it. Hence we have had

occasion to use the armed forces to assist in evacuating British citizens in times of

strife - notably from Cyprus in 1974, from Lebanon in 1984, and from Aden last

year. Our interests lie, however, not in evacuating our citizens, but in regional

stability, which enables them to live abroad in security.

4. Regional stability is important, too, because of our dependence on overseas

commerce. Although some 80% of our visible trade is now with other developed

countries, we are still vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of certain

commodities, such as oil and strategic minerals, from remoter parts of the world.

1

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Helping to maintain stability and ensure the free use of the seas is therefore very

much in our interests.

5. These considerations, together with the contribution that our out-of-area

capabilities can make to our wider foreign policy aims, all generate a defence

dimension to our activities outside the NATO area. These take several forms:

Permanent Garrisons

We plan to keep a military presence on the Falkland Islands and in the

Protection Zone at the level necessary to deter aggression and defend

the Islands. Mount Pleasant airport was completed last year, the

remaining facilities will be completed shortly, and most of the garrison

has already moved there. The Royal Engineers have cleared military

debris from Stanley airfield, and the land will be returned to the

Falkland Islands Government. The concentration of the garrison at

Mount Pleasant, and the ability that the airport gives us for rapid

reinforcement of the Islands if necessary, have permitted some force

reductions. Force levels remain under continual review in the light of

the threat.

We shall retain responsibility for the defence and internal security of

Hong Kong until 1997, when control of the territory passes to the

Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China. At present the garrison

consists of four infantry battalions - three Gurkha and one British - and

supporting units, together with Royal Navy and RAF elements. As

foreshadowed in last year&apos;s Statement, our confidence in the stability of

Hong Kong enabled us to reduce the strength of the garrison by one

battalion, leading to the disbandment of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Gurkha

Rifles, on 15 January 1987. Nearer 1997, it is planned to reduce the

strength of the garrison still further, as the Royal Hong Kong Police

begin to carry out a higher proportion of the internal security and other

2

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

tasks currently carried out by the garrison. But all decisions will be

taken in close consultation with the Hong Kong Government: we plan to

maintain a garrison in the territory up to the date of transfer of

authority in 1997. The Gurkhas will continue to have a role within the

British Army after that date.

A Gurkha battalion and supporting units are based in Brunei, at the

request of His Majesty the Sultan. Brunei also provides exercise facili-

ties for troops from the Hong Kong garrison; and home-based units take

part in jungle training there.

British forces are stationed in Belize, at the request of the Govern-

ment, to protect the country from external aggression; and a Royal

Navy guardship is permanently assigned to the Caribbean in support.

The election of a civilian government in Guatemala was a hopeful sign

for progress towards a settlement of the territorial dispute, as was

President Cerezo&apos;s statement that he wishes to resolve the differences

between Belize and Guatemala. The United Kingdom and Guatemala

agreed to resume consular links in August 1986 after a gap of nearly

five years, and full diplomatic relations were resumed on 29 December

1986.

In Cyprus we maintain two Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs); the role of the

4,000-strong British Forces Cyprus is to protect the SBAs and our other

Retained Sites, to operate their facilities, to maintain the SBAs and

RAF Akrotiri as Forward Mounting Bases for operations in the area, to

provide training facilities for Army and RAF detachments, and to

support the United Nations forces in Cyprus and the Near East (see

below), which themselves include nearly 1,000 British troops.

Reinforcement and Support

All our garrisons need regular support in peacetime, and all might need

to be reinforced rapidly in time of tension. The capacity to do this is

provided by each of the three Services. Although we do not maintain

forces exclusively for operations outside the NATO area, we can (after

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

consultation with our NATO allies) deploy substantial and well-balanced

forces that could operate, if necessary, anywhere in the world.

Ships of the Royal Navy are continuously deployed in the Arabian

Sea area to assist British merchant shipping in the Gulf. The

Navy also has vessels in Hong Kong, the West Indies and the

South Atlantic, and an Ice Patrol Ship visits Antarctica during the

summer. This coverage is supplemented by periodic Task Group

deployments (see page [ ]) to many other parts of the world.

Naval and amphibious operations could be sustained without shore

support for a prolonged period by using the specialised replenish-

ment vessels of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, supplemented, if need

be, by ships taken up from trade.

Military forces for land operations outside the NATO area would

probably be drawn from 5 Airborne Brigade and 3 Commando

Brigade Royal Marines. The wartime tasks of these units remain

respectively those of home defence and the reinforcement of

NATO&apos;s Northern Flank; but either or both could be deployed

worldwide at short notice, by air, sea or a combination of the two.

5 Airborne Brigade can launch a parachute assault at battalion

group strength from Hercules aircraft.

The Royal Air Force provides support for all our overseas

garrisons, some garrisons having RAF aircraft permanently ,

stationed. If necessary these can be reinforced by air defence and

offensive support aircraft which, with air-to-air refuelling, can

deploy at short notice and over very long ranges. The Air Tran-

sport Force (ATF) provides routine support for the garrisons,

deployments and overseas exercises; and in an emergency could be

called on to re-deploy forces worldwide. By the end of 1988, all

ATF aircraft will be equipped for air-to-air refuelling and will,

therefore, be less dependent on staging airfields or overflying

rights.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Exercises, Deployments and Training

The regular programme of overseas deployments carried out by all

three Services does more than simply provide much-needed training

opportunities in a wide variety of testing, and often hostile, environ-

ments. It also enables the armed forces to add their own unique contri-

bution to the achievements of more conventional diplomacy. This con-

tribution takes many forms: goodwill visits by the Royal Navy;

exercises with the armed forces of other countries; displays by teams

such as the RAF Red Arrows; demonstrations in support of defence

sales, and so on. Exercises and deployments overseas in 1986, and some

of those planned for 1987, are described on page [ ]. Exercise SAIF

SAREEA, in particular, which was held last year in the Gulf, tested our

capability to mount a strategic deployment rapidly by air and sea and

provided an excellent opportunity to practise combined operations with

a host nation.

Military Assistance Overseas

A particularly popular, cost-effective and appreciated way of promot-

ing stability and security in areas of the world important to Britain is

by military assistance programmes designed to help friendly nations

improve and maintain the effectiveness of their armed forces. We do

not provide such assistance indiscriminately: as in the case of defence

sales, there may be military or political difficulties, human rights issues

or broader security considerations that argue against particular training

commitments. But within these constraints, and those of available

resources, our programme is wide-ranging: in 1985-86 over 650

Servicemen were on loan service to countries outside NATO, and over

3,600 students from such countries attended military training courses in

Britain.

5

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

International Peacekeeping

We support the principle of deploying multinational forces, normally

under United Nations auspices, to participate in peacekeeping opera-

tions; and we are happy for British troops to take part in such opera-

tions where they can make a useful contribution. At present we contri-

bute to the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai and the UN

Forces in Cyprus. We also provide logistic support to the UN Forces in

Cyprus, in Lebanon, and on the Golan heights from the SBAs in Cyprus.

6. Some have argued that Britain can no longer afford to maintain all its out-of-

area commitments and should tailor them or withdraw completely. But, as Figure

10 shows, our overseas defence commitments are not expensive. Apart from the

garrison in the Falkland Islands - the cost of which is expected to fall substantially

over the next few years - the sums involved are very small in proportion to the

benefits they bring. And in a period of tension or war in Europe the Servicemen

and equipment concerned could be brought back for deployment within the NATO

area or on home defence tasks.

7. We must, of course, be realistic about what - in political, military and econo-

mic terms - we can afford to do. And we must aim to use our defence resources as

effectively as we can in support of our interests throughout the world. The modest

proportion of those resources that we devote to out-of-area activities is well worth

the dividends earned in terms of national security and standing, and the inter-

national stability on which our future well-being depends.

CHAPTER FOUR : THE ARMED FORCES

401. This chapter describes the contribution made by the three Services to the

United Kingdom&apos;s four NATO roles outlined in Chapter 3. Each of these - the

nuclear role, defence of the United Kingdom, of the European mainland and of the

Eastern Atlantic and Channel - is complementary to the others, forming the &apos;Seam-

less Robe&apos; of deterrence discussed in last year&apos;s Statement. And while each

Service&apos;s contribution is distinctive, what is described below is the part that each

plays in a team effort.

402. The Services are also, of course, part of the wider community, and this

chapter outlines some of the ways in which their skills are used, directly or

indirectly, to help the civilian population both at home and abroad.

THE ROYAL NAVY

403. The Royal Navy is responsible for the deployment of the United Kingdom&apos;s

independent strategic nuclear deterrent, provided since 1969 by our force of four

Polaris submarines. The force will continue to remain effective until it is replaced

by Trident in the mid-1990s (see page [ ]).

404. The defence of Western Europe depends on NATO&apos;s ability to ensure the

safe passage of seaborne reinforcements and supplies across the Atlantic, Channel

and North Sea. NATO therefore maintains powerful maritime forces in the Eastern

Atlantic and Channel areas - nearly 70% of which are provided by the Royal Navy -

ready to deploy early against the Soviet Northern Fleet, if necessary before the

arrival of US naval reinforcements. In wartime, the Royal Navy would undertake a

variety of tasks in the area:

the interception and containment of Soviet forces in the Norwegian

Sea;

direct defence of reinforcement, re-supply and economic shipping, in

conjunction with US and European maritime forces and supported by

the RAF;

anti-submarine defence of the NATO Striking Fleet Atlantic; and

protection and deployment of the combined United

Kingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force to reinforce the Northern

Flank of NATO.

405. Defence of the United Kingdom is, of course, vital to those of us who live

here. But the geographical location of these islands also makes them essential to

NATO. The Royal Navy contributes to the defence of this country by mine

countermeasures (MCM) and defensive mining of home waters, by contributing

additional layers of air defence, and, as a consequence of forward deployment

operations in the Norwegian Sea, by helping to prevent the threat of attack from

the north.

406. Defence of the Northern Region is of crucial importance to the United

Kingdom. 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines would be available at a time of

tension or war to reinforce Norway, the Baltic Approaches or the Atlantic islands,

the Royal Navy providing the specialist amphibious shipping and support ships

required for its deployment. In November the Government announced in the House

of Commons that it had decided to retain an amphibious capability in the longer

term. The assault ships, HMS Fearless and Intrepid, which could be used in support

of such operations, will remain in service until the mid-1990s. Feasibility studies

to examine the possibility of extending their lives have begun and, later this year,

we intend to begin studies into the alternative possibility of building new vessels.

We are also considering the means of providing helicopter lift, including the

possibility of an aviation support ship. Further support is provided by our six

Landing Ships Logistic, one of which, the replacement Sir Galahad, is planned to

come into service later this year.

407. The Royal Naval and Royal Marines Reserves play an important role in

reinforcing our regular forces, as well as providing maritime home defence by

carrying out MCM tasks and defending key points, ports and anchorages against

attack. The Royal Marines Reserves will also augment the UK/Netherlands

Amphibious Force. We maintain a strong organisation for naval control of shipping,

run largely by the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service (this

year celebrating its Silver Jubilee), which would be activated in a time of tension

to assist the safe passage of allied merchant shipping both around the United

Kingdom and worldwide.

408. The Navy&apos;s current strength is described at Annex B. Recent additions to

its equipment programme are set out in Table 2. Because of the increasing size

and capability of the Soviet submarine fleet, we place particular emphasis on our

anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability. Nuclear weapon systems deployed by the

Royal Navy include nuclear depth-bombs for ASW, which can be carried by

shipborne helicopters; and free-fall nuclear bombs, which can be delivered by

carrier-launched Sea Harriers. We plan to increase the proportion of nuclear-

powered vessels in our submarine force within broadly constant numbers overall.

The diesel-electric submarines in service will consist of the new powerful and quiet

Upholder class, four of which are now on order. The updating of our surface escort

fleet is also continuing. Six Type 22 frigates are currently under construction, and

orders have been placed for the first four of the new Type 23 ASW frigates: the

first of class is planned to come into service around 1990. In last year&apos;s Statement

we reported that the feasibility study for the NATO frigate replacement was

completed. Negotiations for the next stage, project definition, are now under way.

This ship, which in the British variant would have an anti-air warfare bias, could

eventually replace our Type 42 destroyers. Last year we also ordered the first of

the new Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment Vessels (AOR), and we are currently

negotiating an order for the second. The AOR will need to be able to operate far

from the main body of the Fleet, supporting towed-array vessels, and will be

equipped with weapon systems to defend herself and the valuable cargo that she

will carry. She will also provide helicopter maintenance facilities. The collabora-

tive Anglo-Italian EH 101 programme to develop a new ASW helicopter is proceed-

ing, and the first prototype should fly shortly; an initial order of 50 aircraft is

envisaged.

MERCHANT SHIPPING

1. Defence needs in time of war cannot just be met from the resources

maintained by the armed forces in peacetime. The British merchant fleet will be

essential for the transport of reinforcements to the regions of Allied Command

Europe and across the North Atlantic, and for certain specialised tasks in support

of the Royal Navy. The merchant fleets of our allies also have an essential part to

play in the common defence.

2. Together with the Department of Transport, the Ministry of Defence is

monitoring the availability of merchant shipping to meet the various needs of the

armed forces. Over the last decade there has been a very substantial reduction in

the number of ships on the United Kingdom register, and British shipowners are

continuing to sell vessels or transfer them to dependent territory and foreign

registers. This does not mean the ships are lost for defence purposes. The

Government already has the power in time of tension or war to requisition ships on

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

dependent territory as well as United Kingdom registers - a power used quickly and

effectively at the time of the Falklands conflict in 1982 - and it would be possible

by legislation to extend this power to ships on foreign registers which are

beneficially owned by British operators.

3. The number of available merchant vessels on the United Kingdom and

dependent territory registers in the categories required to meet the needs of the

armed forces is shown in Volume 2, Table 1.3. In general, these needs are well

covered, except in the case of trawlers suitable for mine countermeasures

purposes. Studies of other ways of meeting that requirement have shown that the

task could be undertaken by suitably modified off-shore support vessels. As the

shape and size of the merchant fleet continue to change, other plans may also need

to be adjusted.

4. The previous paragraph relates only to the merchant shipping that is of direct

concern to the Ministry of Defence: the shipping required by our armed forces for

European reinforcement and operational support of the Royal Navy. In time of

war, NATO nations would pool merchant ships not needed for national defence or

coastal shipping purposes, and vessels required for transatlantic reinforcement and

civil supply would be drawn from this pool. Because of concern about the possible

effect of the decline of NATO&apos;s merchant fleets on such requirements, the

Government has taken the initiative in pressing for a NATO-wide study to be made

of the Alliance&apos;s ability to meet its needs for merchant shipping in time of

emergency or war. NATO is considering this proposal.

5. The Government has also addressed the need for adequate trained and

experienced crews to man the merchant ships required in crisis and war. We have

announced our intention of contributing towards training and travel costs for

British seafarers, thus encouraging the retention of British nationals on board

British vessels; and of establishing a Merchant Navy Reserve to provide a pool of

experienced seafarers in time of need. These proposals are being worked out in

consultation with shipowners&apos; and seamen&apos;s representatives. Parliament will be

asked to grant any necessary powers. We continue to monitor the position and will

take any further measures that may be necessary to ensure that the needs of the

armed forces can be met.

THE ARMY

409. The centre-piece of the Army&apos;s contribution to NATO is its role in Europe&apos;s

Central Region. Our land and air forces there demonstrate our positive commit-

ment to the security of Europe and are the embodiment of the concept that the

forward defence of the Federal Republic of Germany is the forward defence of the

United Kingdom itself. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) consists of elements

of a major combat force, l(BR)Corps, together with its logistic support. Its

peacetime establishment of 55,000, planned to increase to 56,000 by the end of the

decade, includes three armoured division headquarters, seven armoured brigades,

an air-mobile brigade and substantial corps troops. On mobilisation, numbers would

rapidly be expanded to over 150,000 by the movement of 2nd Infantry Division

headquarters, two Regular infantry brigades and two Territorial Army (TA)

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

infantry brigades from the United Kingdom to the Federal Republic, together with

a number of smaller units and individual regular and reservist personnel. In the

Federal Republic the Army deploys one regiment of Lance surface-to-surface

missiles and five regiments of artillery capable of firing nuclear warheads supplied

by the United States.

410. Together with corps from Belgium, the Netherlands and the Federal Republic

of Germany, i(BR)Corps forms NATO&apos;s Northern Army Group (NORTHAG), which

is responsible for the defence of the northern half of the Federal Republic from

Cologne to the Elbe; within that area l(BR)Corps has been allocated a 65km

stretch of front. The NATO appointment of Commander NORTHAG is filled by the

Commander-in-Chief BAOR. NORTHAG&apos;s plans and concepts of operations were

revised during 1985, as outlined in last year&apos;s Statement.

411. We provide an infantry battalion, an armoured reconnaissance squadron and

artillery, engineer, helicopter and logistic support for the Allied Command Europe

Mobile Force (Land), which is available to SACEUR for deployment on either the

Northern or Southern Flanks of NATO. Additionally, the United Kingdom Mobile

Force (UKMF) is currently earmarked for rapid deployment in tension or war to the

Baltic Approaches, where it would reinforce either Denmark or Schleswig-Holstein.

412. The Army provides the majority of the 100,000 ground forces available for

the defence of the United Kingdom, including Regular, TA and reservist units.

Their responsibilities include the protection from sabotage or attack of vital

installations and bases.

413. As foreshadowed in last year&apos;s Statement, the second phase of the Territorial

Army&apos;s expansion is now under way, with the formation of five of the six planned

infantry battalions, three of which have home defence roles; two more Royal

Engineer airfield damage repair squadrons, and an Army Air Corps squadron

equipped with the Scout utility helicopter, also in home defence roles; and other

supporting units. Recruiting for the Home Service Force, which is an integral part

of the TA raised specifically for the home defence role, continues to go well.

Planning is also under way to assign specific wartime roles to an additional 35,000

Regular Army reservists, in both the United Kingdom and BAOR. The reservists

would either be assigned to reinforce existing units or formed into General Service

Units, each of about company strength.

CONFIDENTIAL

414. The Army&apos;s commitment to countering the terrorist threat in Northern

Ireland in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) remains undiminished,

the other two Services continuing to provide support as required. Since the

Services became actively involved in Northern Ireland in 1969 the nature of the

task has changed, and the level of violence, which peaked in 1972, has declined

considerably. This is reflected by the drop in the numbers of Regular Army

personnel present in the Province, from a peak of some 22,000 in the early 1970s to

the current level of just over 10,000 (including ten Regular infantry battalions).

The Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), which with its 6,500 personnel has continued

to improve its professionalism and capablity, contributes a substantial proportion

of the high level of support to the RUC that the Army still provides. Sadly, the

cost in human lives remains high. 12 soldiers, including eight members of the UDR,

were killed in 1986, bringing the total since 1969 to 545. Another 55 were injured.

The dedication and bravery of all the members of the armed forces in the face of

this toll of human lives is demonstrated by the fact that, during 1986, 120 gallantry

awards were made, including three Military Medals, two George Medals and 17

Queen&apos;s Gallantry Medals.

415. The Army&apos;s current strength is given at Annex C. Recent additions to its

equipment programme are set out in Table 3. Most significant for BAOR are the

introduction of the Saxon armoured personnel carrier and the ordering of a seventh

regiment of Challenger tanks. In addition, the new Warrior mechanised infantry

combat vehicle (MICV) will enter service shortly. The re-mechanisation of

6(Airmobile) Brigade will begin in 1988 and when completed will significantly

enhance the anti-armour capability of l(BR)Corps. The brigade will eventually

consist of one Challenger-equipped armoured regiment and two infantry battalions

mounted in Warrior MICVs, and will constitute a fully capable mechanised

formation, able to make an important contribution to the defence of the

NORTH AG area. A third air defence regiment will also be formed, equipped with

the new Starstreak high velocity missile, for which orders have recently been

placed. Contracts have also been placed for the new DROPS logistic vehicle fleet

and for the Rapier 2000 anti-aircraft missile system. Among the new equipments

coming into service are the new SA80 infantry weapons, the S10 respirator and a

range of battlefield thermal imager systems.

THE ROYAL ENGINEERS

1. 1987 is the 200th anniversary of the granting of the Royal Charter to the

Royal Engineers, and is therefore an appropriate year to remember their contri-

bution to the support of the armed forces and civil authorities.

2. The Sapper trains as a combat engineer, tradesman and infantry soldier. In

war, Sappers provide combat engineering and construction skills. Their tasks

include: preparation of the battlefield using explosive and other means, including

minefields; demolition of bridges and roads to hinder the enemy&apos;s mobility; and

bridging and other mobility support to enable the armoured formations of

l(BR)Corps to move and fight. The Sappers also support the RAF Harrier force in

the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as providing the airfield damage repair

capability on RAF airfields in both the Federal Republic and the United Kingdom.

3. The ability to meet the construction role is particularly well illustrated by

recent work in Northern Ireland. Last year we reported that the Royal Engineers

had begun assisting the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) with urgent building

work, in particular re-building RUC stations. In the face of persistent intimidation

of contractors in the Province, the need for this help remains, and work began in

February on re-building another two RUC stations.

4. The Royal Engineers have a special responsibility for bomb disposal (see

paragraph [425]). Even now, some 42 years after the end of hostilities, they are

required to deal with many Second World War bombs. Closely related to the

clearance of explosives is the Sapper responsibility for searching for terrorist

devices; this has grown into a highly developed science in the last decade.

5. Sappers also carry out long- and short-term engineering projects at home and

abroad. During 1986, the Royal Engineers deployed on duty to some 33 countries.

They are, for example, currently involved in construction tasks in Canada, Kenya,

Norway and Zimbabwe. They have also, in the past year, helped with flood relief

work in the United Kingdom and disaster relief in the Solomon Islands and El

Salvador (see paragraph [427]).

THE ROYAL AIR FORCE

416. The Royal Air Force supports all pillars of British defence policy: it makes a

significant contribution to SACEUR&apos;s theatre nuclear force for deterrence in

Europe; it has primary responsibility for the air defence of the United Kingdom; it

maintains a powerful tactical air force in the Federal Republic of Germany; it

provides units for the early reinforcement of the Northern Region; and it fulfils

major maritime tasks in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel. The RAF also provides

air-lift support for all three Services. The capabilities of our aircraft give the

United Kingdom the strategic reach and tactical flexibility to meet unforeseen

tasks, whether deployment of combat squadrons using air-to-air refuelling to

7

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

distant locations (as was recently demonstrated with UK-based Tornados in

exercise SAIF SAREEA in the Oman - see paragraph [422]) or support for our

existing overseas bases and garrisons.

417. On the Central Front, RAF Germany forms part of an integrated allied group

of forces, the Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF), whose area of

responsibility includes that of NORTHAG. Like NORTHAG, 2 ATAF is commanded

by a British officer, who is also Commander-in-Chief RAF Germany. The RAF

provides air defence forces for the security of allied airspace in peace and for the

defence of territory and our forces in war, a requirement discharged by two

Phantom squadrons, which form an important part of the allied all-weather fighter

force in the Federal Republic, and by Rapier air defence squadrons.

418. The tasks of NATO&apos;s air forces include combating any Warsaw Pact air

offensive against our ground forces and other military and civilian targets. Both

Phantom and Tornado aircraft would be involved in this role as part of the general

allied air effort. It would also be necessary from the outset to be able to attack

armoured units that had broken through ground defences, and to reduce the weight

of follow-on forces. In this task Tornados could again play a major role, but the

attack of armour would be a specialist task of two squadrons of Harriers. Tornados

operating in the strike/attack role could also deliver British free-fall nuclear

bombs. Jaguar reconnaissance aircraft would provide 2 ATAF with essential

combat intelligence, while two helicopter squadrons, operating Chinook and Puma

support helicopters, would provide tactical air-lift logistic support, primarily for

l(BR)Corps. RAF Regiment Rapier squadrons would provide short-range air

defence of the main airfields.

419. In the United Kingdom, RAF Strike Command has the main responsibility for

air defence both of our islands and of the surrounding sea areas, including outer

area defence of Royal Navy ships or task groups. In war, enemy aircraft would be

countered by RAF fighters maintained on combat air patrol or ground alert,

surface-to-air missiles (Bloodhound and Rapier) and radar-controlled guns

(Skyguard). In peacetime, RAF fighters on Quick Reaction Alert intercept,

identify and if necessary shadow targets approaching British air-space and escort

unauthorised intruders back into international air-space. RAF Strike Command

also operates the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at RAF Fylingdales in

Yorkshire. On 22 May 1986 the Government announced its intention of proceeding

with a modernisation programme for the early warning system, in cooperation with

8

CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

the US Government, to maintain its effectiveness against modern multiple-warhead

missiles.

420. In Maritime operations the RAF&apos;s major concern, in concert with the Royal

Navy, is to safeguard reinforcement and re-supply shipping from North America

against seaborne threats, principally submarines. For this task the RAF operates

four squadrons of Nimrod Mk2 aircraft, which are capable of the full range of ASW

tasks from surveillance to location and attack; the aircraft&apos;s speed, range and

endurance make Nimrod particularly valuable. If required, it can also deliver

stand-off anti-ship missiles, as can the two specialist anti-ship Buccaneer squad-

rons. The Buccaneers can also deliver nuclear bombs.

421. The current strength of the RAF is shown at Annex D. Recent additions to

its equipment programme are set out at Table 4. Our air defence forces are

currently in the midst of a comprehensive modernisation programme, which will

enable them to continue to fulfil this role effectively into the next century. The

first squadron of the Tornado air defence variant will become operational later this

year, installation of the improved UK Air Defence Ground Environment is under

way, and a major enhancement in capability will be achieved in 1991, when the

RAF will take first deliveries of the E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System to

replace the Shackleton. The deployment of the Tornado strike/attack force has

been completed, and the JP 233 cratering and area-denial weapon has entered

service. There will be a substantial improvement in the capability of the RAF&apos;s

STOVL aircraft as the Harrier GR5 - which offers increased range and payload and

subsequently a night/poor weather capability - begins replacing the GR3 next year.

The support helicopter force is to be modernised by replacing the Puma with the

utility variant of EH 101 and using the Puma to replace the ageing Wessex.

Modernisation of the RAF&apos;s tanker force, an important force multiplier, is

continuing.

MAPS AND CHARTS

1. The armed forces have always needed accurate maps and charts for naviga-

tional purposes; but the advent of modern weapon, navigation, communication and

intelligence systems, many of which require geographic material to be provided in

complex digital form, has provided new challenges for the Services&apos; surveying and

map-making organisations. There are three of these: the Royal Navy&apos;s Hydro-

graphic Service, composed of the Hydrographic Department and the Surveying

Flotilla; the Military Survey Service, Royal Engineers; and the Royal Air Force

Aeronautical Information Documents Unit.

9

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

2. The Hydro-graphic Department handles the compilation, production, main-

tenance and issue of Admiralty charts and other navigational publications to the

Fleet and plans the work of the Surveying Flotilla. The Surveying Flotilla conducts

hydrographic and oceanographic surveys in support of naval operations, and on

behalf of the Department of Transport to meet the needs of merchant shipping. In

1986 surveying ships, supported by chartered commercial vessels with Royal Navy

surveying teams embarked, completed an important programme of surveys mainly

around the coast of the United Kingdom. In March 1986, the ocean surveying ship

HMS Hydra was paid off after 20 years&apos; service. HMS Roebuck, the Royal Navy&apos;s

latest coastal survey vessel, was accepted into service on 1 August 1986. She will

become fully operational after extensive trials of the new Survey Information

Processing System in the late spring of 1987.

3. The role of Military Survey is to provide geographical material including

maps, aeronautical charts, terrain information, computer-based digital data and

library information to the armed forces and defence agencies. This involves

Military Survey in worldwide programmes in cooperation with many countries.

During 1986, for example, Military Survey personnel visited 18 countries in four

continents. In particular for NATO defence systems it is essential to ensure inter-

operability between NATO allies on geographic matters. Military Survey is

involved in the standardisation and production of geographic data, including digital

data, to meet British and NATO requirements. A modernisation programme is

under way to ensure that the Military Survey keeps abreast of the most modern and

sophisticated mapping techniques to meet the requirements for geographic support.

4. The Information Documents Unit provides comprehensive aeronautical infor-

mation in a series of documents and charts to all three Services, and to other

NATO and Commonwealth Air Forces. An extensive modernisation programme is

almost complete, including equipment that will allow digital data to be transferred

to the other producers.

EXERCISES

422. During 1986, the armed forces again undertook an extensive and varied

programme of collective training, both with our allies and with other friendly

countries. Major exercises are shown in Table 5. Exercises conducted outside the

NATO area are illustrated in Figure 5. Some of the year&apos;s highlights were as

follows:

HILEX 12, a biennial command post exercise, held in March 1986, to

test and develop the Alliance&apos;s arrangements for consultation and

collective decision-making in a crisis. The opportunity to practise plans

and procedures at lower levels was also taken. Our participation

extended down to Command Headquarters in both the United Kingdom

and the Federal Republic of Germany.

NORTHERN WEDDING, a maritime exercise in the Atlantic and

Norwegian Sea in August and September involving ships, aircraft and

amphibious forces from ten countries, including France. Its purpose

was to test and improve NATO&apos;s ability to counter the possible threat

to reinforcement and re-supply operations in the North Atlantic. Some

150 naval vessels together with many merchant ships and 400 military

aircraft took part. Our contribution included 37 ships, led by HMS Ark

Royal, and the Royal Marine component of the United

Kingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force together with RAF Buccaneer,

Hawk, Lightning, Nimrod and Phantom aircraft. In all, some 35,000

personnel were involved.

BOLD GUARD, a combined field training exercise, which took place in

Jutland and Schleswig-Holstein in September and October, and involved

Danish, Dutch, German and US as well as British units. The major part

of our commitment consisted of 12,000 men of the UKMF, with RAF

Chinook and Puma helicopters. Harrier and Jaguar squadrons were

deployed for offensive air tasks in their reinforcement roles. The

United Kingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force deployed from partici-

pation in NORTHERN WEDDING to form the amphibious element of the

opposing forces for the exercise.

SAIF SAREEA (SWIFT SWORD), the largest exercise to date in a

programme designed to develop our ability to respond rapidly to a crisis

anywhere in the world. A Joint Force Headquarters deployed to Oman

in November with a tri-Service force of some 4,750 personnel consisting

of elements of 3 Commando Brigade embarked in HMS Intrepid and 5

Airborne Brigade, with support from RAF air transport aircraft. Six

Tornados deployed non-stop from the United Kingdom using air-to-air

refuelling and were in operation within 35 minutes of landing. On

arrival, the UK-based force joined HMS Illustrious and major elements

of the Royal Navy task group (see page [ ]), the Gulf Patrol Ships and

the Sultan of Oman&apos;s armed forces for a combined field training

exercise.

423. The programme for 1987 includes a further major exercise with an out-of-

area scenario, PURPLE WARRIOR, which will be staged in south-west Scotland

this November.   In September, the major NATO exercise, OCEAN SAFARI, will

take place in the Atlantic. Eleven Alliance nations will participate in manoeuvres

designed to improve and demonstrate our collective ability to counter the potential

threat to maritime reinforcement and re-supply operations between North America

and Europe. Our own national reinforcement plans will be practised in October,

when the BAOR divisional exercise, KEYSTONE, will involve the UK-based 2

Infantry Division. As part of the exercise, some 24,000 Regular and Territorial

Army personnel, with their support vehicles, will deploy to their wartime area of

operations in BAOR.

GLOBAL 86 [to accompany Fig 6]

1. GLOBAL 86 was the first circumnavigation of the world by a Royal Navy

Task Group for ten years. The Group, consisting of the aircraft carrier HMS

Illustrious and a number of warships and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries, left British waters

in April 1986 on an eight-month deployment (although Illustrious&apos; departure was

delayed by a fire on board, she joined the Group in Singapore). In a full

programme, the Group exercised with friendly navies, sailed 42,000 miles and

visited 21 countries in North America, the Far East, Australasia and the Indian

Ocean. One day in each port was set aside exclusively for promoting British

defence equipment.

2. Highlights of the programme included Royal Navy participation for the first

time in the major US Navy exercise, RIMPAC 86, in the Pacific, together with the

navies of Canada, Australia and Japan; the first RN visit to China since 1980;

attendance at the Sydney Fleet Review for the 75th anniversary of The Royal

Australian Navy; and involvement in SAIF SAREEA (see paragraph [422]). An

unexpected feature of the deployment was the interest shown by foreign navies in

our methods, organisation for both ships&apos; operations and administration, and in the

whole area of achieving value for money and economy of manpower. Figure 6

traces the passage of this deployment, showing the ports visited and the main

exercises undertaken.

THE SERVICES AND THE COMMUNITY

424. The armed forces have a unique and varied contribution to make to the life of

the community, from search and rescue around our coasts to disaster relief

overseas. There is also a less obvious contribution made by the large number of

Servicemen who return each year to civilian life equipped with the skills acquired

during their military training (see page [ ]).

Bomb Disposal

425. The courageous specialist work of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)

teams of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and Royal Engineers, together with those

of the Royal Navy and the RAF, has continued with great success. During the year

they responded to 629 calls and neutralised 4,292kg of explosive in Northern

Ireland; and answered some 4,387 requests for help in Great Britain. Of the latter

471 were suspected terrorist bombs, including 21 devices, 13 explosions, 16 finds,

103 hoaxes and 318 false alarms. A further 3,916 conventional munitions of First

and Second World War vintage, including torpedoes, bombs, mines, depth charges,

other warheads and small arms ammunition, were also disposed of successfully. In

addition, the Services provide training in bomb disposal and search techniques for

the police and for overseas students. The job requires persistence as well as skill.

After some 22 years&apos; clearance work at Orfordness, an area that was extensively

used between 1914 and the late 1950s as a bombing range, the RAF EOD team has

finally vacated its permanent establishment at the site.

Search and Rescue

426. Last year helicopters of the Royal Navy and the RAF, assisted where

necessary by Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft, were called out on 1,319

occasions, resulting in 797 rescues. Their skill and dedication are illustrated by the

incident, in November 1986, when Sea King helicopters from RAF Brawdy lifted 28

people from the iron ore carrier Kowloon Bridge off the southern coast of Ireland

within two hours of a midnight distress call, in a force 11 gale, with 20 foot waves.

In addition, the services of the RAF Mountain Rescue Teams (MRTs) have also been

required on 73 occasions. 14 people were rescued by the MRTs in the past year.

SERVICE TRAINING AND THE BRITISH ECONOMY

1. The opportunities offered by the Services for training and education are sub-

stantial; the number of branches, trades and employment groups runs into many

hundreds. From the moment recruits enter the Services, their training is designed

to build self-discipline and the ability to work as a member of a team. These

qualities form the foundation on which later training in trade skills and the

exercise of responsibility are based.

2. Each year some 15,000 Servicemen and women complete their engagements

in the Services&apos; major skill or trade groups and become available for civilian

employment. Over a third will have been employed in mechanical, electrical or

civil engineering trades; the remainder will have served in a wide variety of

13

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

occupations - such as transport, communications, catering, accounting, personnel

management and medical and dental trades - with obvious applications to the

civilian sector. During their military service not only will they have had

experience of exercising their skills in a disciplined environment, but most will

have received formal training leading to the award of a qualification or certificate

granted or recognised by the appropriate civilian institute or examining body.

Many of these Servicemen and women will have had no vocational qualifications on

entry.

3. Training in the armed forces is undertaken specifically to meet the Services&apos;

needs; but wherever possible it is aligned with the requirements of civilian

examining bodies. Trainees can gain qualifications ranging from degrees and

membership of professional bodies to Heavy Goods Vehicle driving licences. For

example, about 100 post-graduate degrees, 100 medical and dental degrees and 400

other first degrees are obtained each year under Service sponsorship. The first

degree training of engineering officers from all three Services takes place at the

Royal Naval Engineering College at Manadon and the Royal Military College of

Science at Shrivenham. Both colleges also offer MSc engineering courses, and the

Royal Naval College at Greenwich provides a unique degree in nuclear technology

for both the Navy and industry. At a lower level, some 12,000 craft and technical

certificates and diplomas are awarded each year under Service sponsorship.

4. In addition to normal military training, the Services also offer other

categories of training. Most serving personnel with over five years service attend

a resettlement course of up to 28 days duration, to prepare them for a second

career on leaving the Service. Some 11,000 Service personnel attend these courses

each year. The Armed Services Youth Training Scheme provides training in skills

and trades for the young unemployed, including driving, clerical, storekeeping,

vehicle mechanics and telecommunications. Adults can take advantage of the

training available in the Territorial Army, Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Air

Force Reserve units, where communication and leadership skills particularly can be

developed.

Disaster Relief

427. Members of all three Services were involved in disaster relief operations in

1986 and early 1987:

in the Solomon Islands, a detachment from the Royal Corps of Signals

spent several weeks restoring communications and assessing damage

caused by Cyclone Namu in May. They were followed by a team from

the Queen&apos;s Gurkha Engineers who carried out a survey of bridges lost

or damaged by the cyclone, and subsequently supervised the construc-

tion of two Bailey bridges;

assistance was provided to the Jamaican authorities following the

disastrous floods in June.  A company of the 2nd Battalion, the Para-

14

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

chute Regiment took part, as well as troops and RAF Puma helicopters

from the Belize garrison and HMS Ariadne, the West Indies Guardship;

elements of the Belize garrison also contributed to relief operations in

El Salvador following the earthquake in October;

in the United Kingdom, troops were deployed with heavy equipment

following a train crash in Humberside and to assist after flooding in

Yorkshire and Pembroke. During the severe winter weather

experienced in January, some 1,400 soldiers (including members of the

TA) and over 400 vehicles were employed in helping to rescue stranded

motorists, clear snow-bound roads, move supplies to isolated areas and

provide technical assistance.

all three Services made a major contribution, in cooperation with the

Belgian armed forces and civilian rescue services, and assisted by ships

of the Royal Netherlands and Federal German navies, to the rescue of

passengers from the Herald of Free Enterprise, which capsized outside

Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March. Twenty-six Royal Navy divers were

deployed from the United Kingdom by RN and RAF helicopters and

aircraft, and from HMS Hurworth at Ostend, within hours of the

disaster. RAF Sea King helicopters flew with thermal imaging

equipment over the hull to detect survivors, while a team of Army

chaplains helped administer to the needs of survivors and relatives.

TRIDENT - COSTS AND BENEFITS

1. The latest estimate for the Trident programme is  9,265 million. This is  546

million less in real terms than the estimate announced in March last year, and  738

million less than the original estimate of  7,500 million announced in 1982, over

and above the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at King&apos;s Bay,

Georgia. The reduction in the estimate compared with last year is caused by

continuing refinement of costs as the definition of the project improves.

2. The estimate amounts to under 6% of the current equipment budget over the

procurement period. At its peak the programme will account for less than 11% of

this budget. We have committed  3,000 million to the programme so far and have

actually spent  1,000 million. 70% of the expenditure already committed will be

spent in this country, and the United Kingdom&apos;s slice of the total programme is

expected to be about 62%; this arises both from the fact that the components will

be manufactured in this country, and from British industry&apos;s access to US prime

contractors.

15

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

3. What does all this mean in practical terms for British industry? The number

of British firms in direct contact with one or more of the seven US sub-system

prime contractors is now over 340. About 300 firms have been approved as bidders

to the programme, and nearly 200 of them had been invited to bid for contracts on

the US Trident II programme. Some 230 contracts have been placed with British

firms; some of these are follow-on orders to initial awards made during the earlier

advanced development phase; many are small in value but offer considerable

potential over the remaining life of the programme. The total value of contracts

awarded to British industry is more than $50 million.

4. All this is good news for jobs. We estimate that the Trident programme will

sustain an average of 7,500 direct and 6,000 indirect jobs in this country throughout

its procurement period - at its peak 27,000 people will be working, directly or

indirectly, on Trident. Up to 2,500 construction workers will be needed for the

development of the Clyde Submarine Base, and the construction of the first subma-

rine, HMS Vanguard, is likely to provide employment for about 4,000 people at

VSEL in Barrow and 5,000 elsewhere.

5. The Trident programme itself is now well advanced. The keel for HMS

Vanguard was laid last September, and construction is progressing satisfactorily.

The contract for the second submarine will be placed this year. Contracts have

now been placed for the development and initial production of many of the complex

equipments that form the Tactical Weapon System. Work is also proceeding apace

on construction of the supporting infrastructure at the Clyde Submarine Base.

6. Advance works at RNAD Coulport to provide a network of depot roads,

excavate the sites of key buildings, and provide perimeter security are well in

hand, preparatory to the main task of expanding the depot, which will begin later

this year. At Faslane, site preparation and some re-development are also under

way, and work will start shortly on a ship-lift and associated facilities providing

power supplies, workshop and office accommodation. To improve access to Clyde

Submarine Base, and relieve local communities of additional traffic, several new

roads are under construction. At a recent series of public meetings held at

Faslane, local residents and others were told of the progress being made, of the

problems that have been overcome, and of plans for the future.

ESSAY

THE MINIMUM DETERRENT

1. By the mid-1990s, the Polaris strategic deterrent force will be almost 30

years old. The submarines will be nearing the end of their hull life, and the ship

systems and sensors will have been modified and modernised virtually to the limits.

The ability of the boats to patrol undetected will be less certain in the light of

improved Soviet anti-submarine warfare (ASW) techniques, and the ability of the

missiles themselves to penetrate strengthened Soviet anti-ballistic missile (ABM)

defences will be less assured than it is today.

2. These are the hard facts that the Government had to face soon after taking

office in 1979. Because of the long lead-times involved in the procurement of

major weapon systems, an early decision was needed if Britain was to maintain a

credible strategic nuclear deterrent after the end of Polaris&apos; useful life. In 1980,

the then Defence Secretary announced the Government&apos;s intention of buying the

Trident missile system from the United States.

Why a British independent deterrent?

3. The public debate that has followed has ranged far wider than discussion

about particular weapon systems and into the fundamental question of whether or

not this country should remain a major nuclear power. The Government&apos;s reasons

for believing it to be essential that we do so have been set out in full in previous

Statements but, in view of the misunderstandings surrounding the subject, bear

repeating.

4. We judge that the existence of independent European strategic deterrents -

both British and French - significantly reduces the risk of a Soviet attack, whether

conventional or nuclear, on us or our NATO allies. As we explain on page [ ],

deterrence, and preventing war, is a matter of ensuring that the risks involved in

starting a war are seen by a potential aggressor to be far greater than any possible

gains he could hope to achieve. Although the mainstay of the Atlantic Alliance&apos;s

deterrent forces is provided by the United States, the presence of an independent

nuclear deterrent under absolute British control greatly complicates the


CONFIDENTIAL

calculations that would have to be made by anyone contemplating an attack on

Britain or our allies, and helps make aggression an unacceptably risky option.

Although the integrity and vital importance of the US commitment to Europe are

not in doubt, if Soviet leaders were at some stage tempted to calculate, for

whatever reason, that they could impose their will on Western Europe by military

force, without becoming involved in strategic war with the United States, they

would still have to take account of British nuclear forces.

5. Those who argue that the money we are spending on modernising our nuclear

deterrent would be better devoted to strengthening our conventional forces must

answer the following question: would British and Alliance defence capabilities, and

hence the effectiveness of deterrence, be enhanced more by an invulnerable second

strike submarine-launched ballistic missile force; or by a proportional enhancement

of our conventional forces? The answer is clear. In the first place, as we discuss

on page [ ], conventional forces by themselves - no matter how strong - could not

provide an effective deterrent. Moreover, even if the total cost of the Trident

programme were devoted to conventional defence, it would only enable us to

maintain little more than one armoured division with 300 tanks in total. But as

Annex A shows, the Warsaw Pact already outnumbers NATO in tanks by some

30,000. So we would in practice be exchanging the unique contribution to

deterrence made by our independent nuclear forces for a marginal reduction in the

conventional superiority enjoyed by the Warsaw Pact. The Government sees no

benefits in this for anyone except a potential enemy.

Why Trident?

6. This, in brief, is the rationale for Britain&apos;s maintaining an independent

nuclear deterrent into the next century. But why should we be so convinced that

Trident is the best system to do the job? It is worth reminding ourselves of the

basic facts. First, the purchase agreement for Trident is an extension of that

concluded in 1963 for the purchase of Polaris: we shall be buying from the United

States the Trident D5 ballistic missiles and related equipment, together with

continuing spares supply and maintenance support; but the warheads will be built in

this country, as will the submarines themselves. Secondly, like Polaris, the Trident

force will consist of four boats, each capable of carrying 16 missiles.

2

7. When the Government considered the various options for the system to

succeed Polaris, the requirement was very clear: it had both to fulfil our minimum

force deterrence criteria; and to be affordable. It had therefore to be capable of

posing a credible threat to key aspects of Soviet state power; and of posing such a

threat at all times. In other words, it had to maintain our ability to inflict, if

necessary, an unacceptable level of damage on those targets likely to be most

valued by Soviet leaders. Secondly, Soviet leaders had to be convinced that,

notwithstanding defensive or other measures, our weapons would survive any pre-

emptive attack and would reach their target. And thirdly, the system had to be

capable of meeting these requirements throughout its service life in the face of

technical changes and advances in the defensive systems that it would have to

penetrate.

8. These requirements are more demanding now than when we embarked on the

Polaris programme. To begin with, since the late 1960s when our Polaris entered

service, the Soviet Union has deployed the only operational ABM system in service

anywhere in the world and is currently modernising and expanding it up to the 100

launchers around Moscow allowed by the ABM treaty. This means that, if the

Soviet Union is to be denied any possible sanctuary from which to prosecute

aggression without fear of direct reprisal, we shall need to carry more warheads in

the future to pose the same threat as in the early days of Polaris. And secondly, as

noted earlier, Soviet ASW techniques have significantly improved over the last 20

years and will continue to do so.

9. Measured against these requirements Trident will represent no more than a

minimum deterrent. As with Polaris, four boats are the minimum needed to

guarantee one on patrol at all times. The increased payload of D5 offers the best

prospect of being able to penetrate Soviet ABM defences in the face of possible

improvements during the lifetime of the system. And the increased range of the

D5 missile will give the submarines the necessary extra sea-room in which to

conceal themselves as Soviet ASW techniques improve.

10. Some have argued that the British Government is planning an excessive

increase in the number of warheads compared with Polaris, at a time when the

superpowers are discussing 50% reductions in their strategic arsenals. In fact, we

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

have made clear that each British Trident boat will carry no more than a maximum

of 128 warheads - far less than the full capacity of D5; this represents an increase

of up to 2{ times the payload of the Polaris boats, when they entered service in the

1960s each carrying 48 warheads. That is the minimum necessary in our judgement

to keep the deterrent effective and credible.

11. Trident&apos;s multiple independently-targetable warheads enable it to strike more

targets than Polaris; but this is not a key factor from the point of view of

providing an effective British deterrent. The essential capability for us is to be

able to continue to hold at risk key aspects of Soviet state power, not to threaten

the maximum possible number of individual targets. Our Trident forces will deploy

with the minimum number of warheads consistent with this requirement. Even

after the 50% decreases in superpower arsenals discussed at Reykjavik, Trident

would represent a smaller proportion of Soviet strategic warheads than did Polaris

in 1970.

12. Trident also meets the criterion of affordability. No major defence capability

can be acquired cheaply; but, especially by comparison with major conventional

programmes, we believe that Trident offers exceptional value for money. The

costs and benefits of the Trident programme are addressed separately on page [ ].

Why not an alternative?

13. The Government is fully committed to the Trident programme - a commit-

ment that stems from a rational assessment of Britain&apos;s defence needs in the world

of the 1990s and beyond, as well as from the belief that no other system would

meet those needs as cost-effectively. But others have different views. Construc-

tive ideas on an issue as important as guaranteeing the security of our country are

to be welcomed. The problem is that all of the alternatives that have been

proposed were examined before we took the decision to buy Trident and were found

to have major drawbacks - drawbacks that we believe rule them out as serious

options:

4

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

A wholly British-built deterrent force: British industry has not had a

major capability to build strategic missiles since the 1960s, and to have

tried to re-establish this capability would have taken longer than the

time available. It would also have involved major uncertainties; and

would without doubt have been very expensive. The United States had

been our tried and tested partner in this field for some 25 years, and

given that - as with Polaris - the operational independence of Trident

would be unimpaired, the Government recognised the potentially great

financial advantage to be derived from maximum cooperation and

commonality with the United States.

Sea-launched cruise missiles: Cruise missiles certainly have an impor-

tant military value. Given their particular operational characteristics,

they can be a very useful addition to an armoury that, as in the United

States, has a range of strategic systems or, as in Europe, is part of a

range of forces linking the conventional military option to the last-

resort strategic strike force. But when judged against the criteria that

the British strategic deterrent has to meet, cruise missiles simply do

not fit the bill.

In the first place, they have serious operational shortcomings. Develop-

ments in stealth technology notwithstanding, the missiles are likely to

become much more vulnerable to the Soviet Union&apos;s increasingly

sophisticated air defences over the next two decades. This country

could not afford to keep updating and modernising its force to take

account of Soviet technological advances. Moreover, current cruise

missiles have far less range than ballistic missiles; this means that a

Trident submarine will have approximately 15 times more sea-room in

which to conceal itself than would a boat with cruise missiles. And

cruise missiles have to be fired within 500 miles of land or else they

become inaccurate. This further limits the ocean space available.

The other main objection flows from these operational considerations:

it is one of cost. Although cruise missiles on a one-for-one basis are

cheaper than their ballistic counterparts and are actually more

5

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

accurate, each cruise missile has only one warhead, compared with the

multiple warheads on each Trident ballistic missile. This, combined

with the operational problems, means that we would need many more

cruise than ballistic missiles to be sure of achieving the striking power

necessary for an effective deterrent. More importantly, more missiles

means more submarines; and submarines are the most costly component

of any sea-launched system. We assess that it would take 11 sub-

marines, each capable of carrying 80 cruise missiles, to produce the

equivalent deterrent power to that of a force of four submarines, each

with 16 Trident ballistic missiles. To make a cruise missile force as

effective as one based on ballistic missiles would, therefore, in broad

terms involve double the expenditure both of capital and of running

costs.

Air-launched cruise missiles: Air-launched cruise missiles share the

operational drawbacks of their sea-launched counterparts; this means

that, compared with ballistic missiles, many more would be needed to

meet our deterrence criteria. Given the large numbers involved,

additional airfields and support facilities would be necessary to base the

launch aircraft; and to maintain existing aircraft in their vital conven-

tional roles, it is almost certain that considerable numbers of new,

dedicated nuclear-delivery aircraft would have to be bought.

Another major drawback concerns the pre-launch survivability of

aircraft and supporting airfields; these would be much more vulnerable

than submerged submarines. Protective measures, such as the con-

struction of hardened aircraft shelters, could offset the danger to an

extent but would also add significantly to costs. Alternatively,

continuous aircraft patrols could ensure that the force would not be

caught on the ground; but these would be extremely expensive, in terms

both of resources and manpower. And to have RAF nuclear-armed

aircraft on permanent patrol in and around British airspace would

probably be unacceptable to most people in this country.

A deterrent force based on air-launched cruise missiles would, as with

the sea-based force, probably cost about twice as much as Trident.

CONFIDENTIAL

An Anglo-French deterrent: If one were considering a fully integrated,

jointly controlled Anglo/French nuclear deterrent, significant problems

would arise. Our two countries would need to agree on the criteria the

force would have to meet, the targets that would be put at risk, the

details of complementary refits and patrol cycles and, by no means

least, the process of consultation leading to the launch of a nuclear

weapon and the authority for the actual firing of a weapon.  And if a

jointly controlled force were contemplated,  which country would

change its defence philosophy? For certainly there would have to be a

change.    British nuclear forces are committed -to NATO, and the

Alliance would unquestionably be weakened in military and political

terms if they were removed.   France, on the other hand, although a

member of the Alliance, is not part of the NATO military structure,

and her forces are therefore independent of the Alliance.

Trident Submarines with French missiles: Could we then simply buy

French rather than American missiles? There was no missile in the

French armoury in 1979 that would have met our deterrence needs.

Information has since been published on the proposed new-generation

French missile, the ballistic submarine-launched M5, which suggests

that it might meet some of our requirements. But this is only now

about to begin development, whereas Trident&apos;s development is already

well under way. There must therefore be some doubt whether the M5

would be available to us within the same time-scale as Trident. More

significantly, the switch to a different missile would entail a substantial

re-design of the submarine, associated systems and the missile warhead.

This would inevitably lead to several years&apos; delay in deployment of the

replacement system and to very considerable additional costs.

14. All this leads to the conclusion that, for the United Kingdom, the only real

policy options remain either to have a credible strategic deterrent that we can

afford - in other words Trident - or to have none. The worst course would be to opt

for some kind of half-way house that not only used up valuable resources but, at

the end of the day, represented in Soviet eyes - ultimately the only eyes that really

matter - no real deterrent at all.

CHAPTER FIVE : EQUIPPING THE ARMED FORCES

PROCUREMENT POLICY

501. The ability of our armed forces to fulfil the roles outlined in Chapter 4 and

on page [ ] depends to a large extent on the quality and quantity of their

equipment. It is the task of the Procurement Executive (PE) of the Ministry of

Defence to provide them with this equipment on time, in the quantities they need,

to the standard required to meet the threat they face on the battlefield, and at the

keenest price. The resources that we are investing in equipment are considerable:

in 1987-88 we propose to spend  8,539 million, representing 45.5% of the total

defence budget.

502. The Ministry of Defence is the largest customer of British industry.

Clearly, with its purchasing power, the PE must pursue policies that will not only

secure the best value for money but also promote the efficiency and long-term

health of our defence industrial base. This means being:

A demanding customer: our standards are high but not unnecessarily

so: our negotiations, and in particular pricing, must be keen but fair.

By satisfying the Ministry of Defence, British industry should be well

placed to satisfy the requirements of other customers worldwide.

An informed customer: our requirements must be clearly defined and

expressed in terms that encourage cost-effective responses and

enable export potential to be taken fully into account.

A &apos;hands off customer: our contractors should bear the full responsi-

bility for the successful completion of their contracts, while keeping

the Ministry informed of progress as necessary. Carrying risk, they

should have the opportunity for reward if they are successful and

efficient in delivering to time, cost and specification.

We seek a relationship of trust and mutual understanding with our suppliers, but the

language of that relationship is thoroughly commercial.

503. We expect final figures to show that in 1986-87 we sustained the welcome

improvement of recent years and achieved a level of competition significantly

higher than that pertaining before the initiative to put greater emphasis on

competition was taken - although the level of achievement each year is dependent

on the nature of the defence industry and of the orders to be placed. 1986-87 saw

real successes in competition, and some examples are given [below]. Furthermore,

the proportion by value of contracts let on the basis of cost plus a percentage

profit arrangement declined from 15% in 1983-84 to less than 10% in 1985-86. This

trend has continued, and in the last year no new major development contract has

been placed on that basis.

SUCCESSES IN PROCUREMENT

The following are some examples of the benefits gained from competition in

procurement during the last year:

The winning bid in a competition for a multiplexer system was only

about 75% of the estimated price. In addition, the winning company&apos;s

equipment offers a number of technical advantages that will lead to

cost savings elsewhere.

Recent competitions for sonobuoys produced savings of up to 30% on

the prices previously paid under single-source procurement arrange-

ments.

A competition for the repair and overhaul of Pegasus engines produced

savings in real terms of about one third on prices previously paid.

In a competition for training missiles, the winning tenderer&apos;s price was

nearly 50% lower than the last non-competitive price.

A competition for torpedo warheads led to our placing a contract with

the previous non-competitive supplier at a price some 16% lower than

that initially estimated.

Although we reluctantly had to cancel the Nimrod Airborne Early

Warning contracts (see paragraph [508]), the introduction of competi-

tion into the project led to our being offered much better terms than

would otherwise have been available. The subsequent request for best

and final offers, and some tough negotiating, led to a reduction in price

of a further 12% and better contract terms.

New Measures

504. We are pressing ahead in our drive for better value for money. In the past

year we have worked on a number of new measures:

2

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

With competition a cornerstone of our policy, it is important that

industry should understand clearly how we apply it. We have therefore

published guidelines setting out our approach.

We have also published a code of practice to ensure that contractors

carry forward our emphasis on competition to the sub-contract level.

We have now launched a fortnightly, self-financing, MOD Contracts

Bulletin, giving details of opportunities to compete for business at both

prime- and sub-contract level. This includes details of Ministry of

Defence orders estimated to cost over  0.5 million, as well as a

supplement showing opportunities for British firms in the US Strategic

Defence Initiative (SDI).

We have revised our practices on the interim financing of contracts to

provide a further incentive towards timely and satisfactory perfor-

mance by linking payments more closely to achievement. Guidelines on

this have been published.

Flexibility in carrying forward unspent provision from one year to the

next allows project managers greater freedom to manage their pro-

grammes efficiently. The need for this flexibility has been increased by

our new approach to interim payments, under which we aim to pay

against milestones achieved and not simply because time has elapsed.

We previously had scope to carry forward underspend of up to 5% of the

provision for procurement expenditure. With the agreement of the

Treasury, we can now carry forward up to an additional  400 million a

year. This additional flexibility is for a three-year period.

Studies of spares procurement have identified a number of factors

leading, on occasion, to higher prices than are necessary. In particular,

improved management techniques should enable us to operate a more

economic ordering pattern and so achieve substantial savings.

As a further aid to cost-consciousness we plan to label items in Service

stores with their price.

SMALL FIRMS INITIATIVE

1. We launched this initiative in November 1986, as part of our continuing effort to

encourage this enterprising sector of British industry to compete for our business. One

of our first steps had been the publication in 1983 of the booklet Selling to the MOD.

After distributing 45,000 copies of the first edition, we published a revised and

expanded version in 1986, of which some 15,000 copies have since been distributed. We

have now taken this further by setting up a Small Firms Advice Division, whose remit is

to:

collaborate in the operation of our Small Firms Research Initiative, whereby

businesses with flexibility and a readiness to innovate will be able to bid for

an additional  1 million of our research and development funds. And, as

opportunities occur, representatives of small firms will be appointed to the

boards of our research establishments;

provide guidance and advice to small firms on our various contractual,

financial and quality assurance procedures so that they &quot;can plan and submit

bids more easily. In addition to meeting them individually, we shall hold a

series of conferences for them during 1987;

reinforce an informed and receptive attitude towards small firms among

Ministry staff, especially our local purchase officers in each command and

establishment, who will have a particularly important role in encouraging

small businesses to tender for Ministry work.

2. Within only two months of the establishment of the Small Firms Advice Division

more than 300 companies, the great majority new to the Ministry of Defence, had been

in touch with it.

Organisation, Staffing and Information

505. Policies are important, but defence procurement is a complex undertaking

requiring a high degree of professionalism and motivation. We must organise our staff

efficiently and provide them with the training and commercial skills that they need if

our policies are to succeed. Similarly, we must ensure that industry is aware of our

aims. To these ends initiatives taken over the past year include:

A new emphasis on training: measures have been taken to ensure that

project managers acquire the necessary skills by experience or appropriate

training.

Improving our professionalism as customers, by developing a better under-

standing of the financial environment in which our suppliers operate and of

their wider corporate objectives and performance, through, for example,

improving our contacts with the City.

4

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Improving our commercial skills, by extending the exchange of personnel

between the PE and industry. This enables our staff to gain first-hand

experience of working in a commercial environment, and brings commer-

cially-minded people from industry into the mainstream of the Department&apos;s

activities. There are now over 200 interchanges a year, more than double

the number of two years ago.

Preparing a booklet outlining the organisation and aims of the PE to

complement existing publications such as Selling to the MOD and Value for

Money in Defence Procurement.

Improving management information in the PE. Information Technology has

a key role to play in helping us to monitor and control PE programmes, and

we are expanding the use we make of it significantly. One example is the

TOPMAST management information system, which gives higher management

swift access to information on major contracts and major contractors.

Quality Assurance

506. The responsibility for supplying defence equipment of the specified quality rests

with the contractor. A constant preoccupation of the project manager in the Ministry

of Defence is to ensure that the right quality for the equipment he is procuring is

clearly specified. He is supported in this role by the staff of the Directorate General of

Defence Quality Assurance, who are deployed in project management teams, in industry

itself and in well-equipped workshops and laboratories. Their work involves advising on

the quality aspects of contracts, including removing ambiguities from specifications to

be given to contractors, identifying opportunities for the use of standard components,

assuring the project manager that contractors are technically competent and have

adequate quality control and, if necessary, assisting in the resolution of technical

problems.

507. These tasks are now being performed against the background of the Ministry&apos;s

policy on competition, which has increasingly encouraged small firms and firms not

traditionally engaged in defence work to demonstrate their abilities. Fears have been

expressed that quality may suffer as competing firms seek to reduce costs. But one of

the merits of competition is that it helps to improve quality. And we shall maintain the

5

CONFIDENTIAL


L CONFIDENTIAL

very high standards we require of contractors. The pursuit of quality within the general

context of value for money, and a proper emphasis on life-cycle - rather than just

initial procurement - costs, have never been so important.

Airborne Early Warning

508. The decision to cancel the Nimrod Airborne Early Warning project and to adopt

instead the Boeing E-3A aircraft as the replacement for the Royal Air Force&apos;s

obsolescent Shackleton aircraft was the most significant procurement decision of the

year. The Government has no doubt that it took the right decision, for reasons

explained at the time and widely accepted. The outcome holds lessons for all

concerned. It underlined the need for many of the improvements in our procurement

procedures that were already in hand and are described above and, in particular, the

need to agree, at the earliest possible stage, contractual terms that place the

contractor under effective discipline, with clear specifications and acceptance criteria.

EQUIPMENT COLLABORATION

509. The drive to achieve greater collaboration with our NATO allies in the develop-

ment and production of equipment continues to play an essential part in our efforts to

make more effective use of the resources available for defence. Neither we nor our

allies can afford to dissipate scarce resources by unnecessarily duplicating development

of the same equipment. We would now expect to develop and produce most significant

new equipments in collaboration with allies unless there are pressing reasons not to do

so - and provided, of course, we get value for money.

510. The impetus towards greater collaboration within Europe in particular comes from

the conviction, shared by our partners, that a more cohesive European effort will

strengthen the Alliance in a number of important ways: politically, by demonstrating

our ability to work closely together; militarily, by reducing the inefficiency that comes

from having different and incompatible versions of the same equipment on the battle-

field; and industrially, by helping to produce a more competitive European industrial

base.

511. The main multilateral forum for European defence equipment collaboration is the

Independent European Programme Group (IEPG) (see also paragraph [308]). Defence

Ministers in the IEPG have stressed that we must improve on the ad hoc arrangements

under which collaborative projects have been generated in the past. Good progress

continues to be made in developing a more systematic approach, including in particular:

Harmonisation of requirements: a further eight European Staff Targets

have been agreed in the last year, making thirteen in all in the last two and

a half years. Close attention has been paid to integrating the Staff Targets

with the NATO Conceptual Military Framework (see Chapter 3). Discus-

sions among interested nations are now proceeding, and we hope that they

will lead to collaborative projects to meet the Staff Targets so far agreed.

Collaborative Research: a number of cooperative technology projects are

under discussion. The IEPG is also focusing attention on Technology

Demonstrator Programmes, the aim being to validate new technologies by

using full-scale engineering models to prove ideas outside the laboratory and

thus reduce the risks involved in any future development.

Improving competitiveness: the Study Team appointed by IEPG Ministers to

make proposals for improving the competitiveness of the European defence

industry reported in December 1986. The team has made far-reaching

recommendations to remove obstacles to greater free trade and industrial

cooperation within Europe and to achieve greater coordination of European

defence research. Its report will be addressed by IEPG Ministers in June

1987.

512. These efforts to improve European collaboration are not an alternative to

transatlantic cooperation: they form part of Europe&apos;s efforts to make a more effective

contribution to the Alliance. In addition, equipment collaboration within NATO has

itself received fresh impetus from the Nunn Amendment to the US FY 86 Defense

Authorisation Act, which set aside funds from the US Defence budget for collaborative

research and development. And the European members have been able to play a

constructive part, in the NATO Conference of National Armament Directors (CNAD),

in exploiting the opportunity offered by that legislation. CNAD is also continuing to

work on enhancing standardization and interoperability of equipment in NATO.

Although attracting less public attention than major equipment projects, this work is

vitally important in ensuring that, should hostilities occur, each national force

committed to NATO could obtain supplies and support services from others. For

example, a study nearing completion is designed to ensure that ground equipment at

airfields can service aircraft from other nations.

MORE CAPABLE AND RELIABLE EQUIPMENT

1. Today&apos;s military equipment is frequently more expensive, item for item, than

yesterday&apos;s. But it is also more capable. Modern technology, skilfully handled,

allows us to increase the combat effectiveness of an individual piece of equipment,

sometimes many times over.

2. For example, one particularly effective raid during the Second World War

involved 560 Lancasters dropping 1,795 tons of bombs. Given the accuracy of

modern weapons systems, if we were planning that raid today we would need only

12 Tornados to drop about 48 tons of explosive to have the same effect. Some

3,900 aircrew flew the Lancasters, while only 24 would be needed to fly the

Tornados.

3. If we are to obtain the best return from our modern equipment, we must

ensure that it is ready to hand and working when it is needed. We must aim to

achieve high reliability and good maintainability. There have been important

advances in this field in recent years. For example, in 1979 a destroyer or frigate

spent 27% of its life, on average, in refit. In 1985 the comparable figure was 16%.


CONFIDENTIAL

4. The more reliable our equipment, the fewer the Servicemen who need to be

diverted from the teeth to the tail to support it. The lower the maintenance bill,

the greater the resources that can be devoted to the front line. So high reliability

and maintainability have an important contribution to make to our search for

better value for money in defence procurement. Achieving them requires good

design from the outset, together with taut procedures for translating that design

into demonstrably reliable production equipment.

5. We are therefore looking into how we can better achieve these aims, through

further improvements in our procurement practices. The rewards should be

significant - to give a current example, new high-pressure turbine blades planned

for Tornado engines are expected to achieve nearly double the life of turbines of

the current production standard for an increase of only 20-30% in production costs.

DEFENCE RESEARCH

514. In 1987-88 we plan to spend some  401 million on defence research,

representing about 2% of defence spending as a whole. This research is aimed at

producing an underlying basis of scientific and technical expertise for application

to the selection, development, production and operation of weapon systems and

equipments.

515. The planning and management of the defence research programme has been

stream-lined to establish more formal links between the research establishments

and the main customers for research and project support in the Ministry of Defence

and other Government departments. The aim is to focus attention sharply on

priorities and end products and thus ensure that scarce resources of money and

scientific manpower are concentrated on areas where the need is greatest and the

prospects of a return most promising.

516. Over the last year, notable achievements at the defence research estab-

lishments include:

The Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, with Pilkington

Space Technology Division, was granted the Queen&apos;s Award for

Technological Achievement in recognition of work on the develop-

ment of cover glasses for satellite solar cells;

Research at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down, on

chemical detection has led to the development of a Chemical Agent

Monitor using ion mobility spectrometry - a device that, besides its

11

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

primary military role, has potential for use in industry for detection

of hazardous gases and explosives;

Two scientists, from the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment,

Malvern, and two scientists of the English Electric Valve Company,

were presented with a Rank Prize Funds Award for 1986 in recog-

nition of their work on the development of infra-red camera-tube

technology. Thermal cameras using these tubes are used by fire-

fighters in 15 countries to &apos;see&apos; through smoke and locate hidden

obstacles and victims.

517. In addition to their primary defence function, the research establishments

cooperate with other Government departments, academic institutions and industry

in research activities that serve both defence and wider aims. Ministry of Defence

support for the universities has recently been enhanced by our participation with

the Department of Education and Science and the Research Councils in funding

joint research grants. We are also seeking to widen the scope of joint programmes

with the universities and Research Councils and to promote the common use of

facilities and staff exchanges.

518. Last year&apos;s Statement described the launch of Defence Technology Enter-

prises Ltd (DTE) to promote civil spin-off from defence research and development

(R 6c D). DTE is now operational at four major establishments; there are already

some 500 items on DTE&apos;s data-base judged to have potential for exploitation, and

the company has recruited some 170 companies as associate members. 15 specific

licences for exploitation of innovative technology from the research establishments

have been successfully concluded, or are in the final stages of negotiation.

519. Collaboration with the private sector in the research field is being further

strengthened through, for example, the National Electronics Research Initiatives,

under which the Department is undertaking collaborative work in electronics at the

Royal Signals and Radar Establishment with the Department of Trade 6c Industry

and private industry. The Ministry of Defence will also contribute to the Link

programme, which was announced by the Prime Minister last year. Link is directed

at Departments with R&amp;D programmes, and is designed to &apos;pull through&apos;

scientific and technological advances from scientific research into marketable

products and services. We also participated in Techmart, an exhibition of

technology transfer at the National Exhibition Centre last November.

CONFIDENTIAL

520. We plan to sign a contract with the Farnborough Aerospace Development

Corporation for the development of 50 acres of land on the southern perimeter of

the Royal Aircraft Establishment for business aviation and high technology

industry.

The Defence Research and Development Base

521. The roles and capabilities that we require our armed forces to have are

many and various - more so than those of any of our NATO allies, other than the

United States. It is not surprising, therefore, that expenditure on R &amp; D has

consistently been a significant element within the defence programme to ensure

that in future, as at present, the Services have equipment relevant to, and

adequate for, the tasks they must be ready to discharge should circumstances so

require.

522. This background to the high proportion of total Government R&amp;D arising on

defence account is not always understood; but the Government shares the under-

lying concern of those who fear that necessary investment in defence R&amp;D may

crowd out valuable investment in the civil sector. Thus, while defence R&amp;D has

contributed to the advance of technology, Britain&apos;s resources of qualified scientists

and engineers, and the skilled manpower supporting them, are not inexhaustible.

Although there is much that we can do and are doing, as described above, to

harness our defence R&amp;D effort to benefit the wider civil economy, defence and

civil work are in competition for the same skills, and it would be regrettable if

defence work became such an irresistible magnet for the manpower available that

industry&apos;s ability to compete in the international market for civil high technology

products became seriously impaired.

523. Accordingly, we shall in future be paying careful attention to this factor in

making our procurement choices, giving special emphasis to avoiding duplication of

successful equipment developments already achieved by our allies. Our policies of

increasing competition in procurement, and encouraging greater international

collaboration to meet the equipment needs of the Alliance, are already aimed at

ensuring more effective use of Britain&apos;s R&amp;D resources. We shall also be

encouraging our suppliers to think more broadly about the relationship between

their defence and civil markets, and we shall be very willing to join with them in

13

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

identifying any changes in our defence procurement processes, consistent with

defence requirements and the achievement of value for money, that would make it

easier for them to achieve success in the latter as well as the former.

DEFENCE EXPORTS

1. The United Kingdom has long been one of the free world&apos;s leading exporters

of defence equipment. By any standards, however, 1986 saw some spectacular

achievements. It began with the conclusion of our biggest ever overseas order: the

purchase of the collaboratively-developed Tornado aircraft and other equipment by

Saudi Arabia. This deal will be worth at least  5 billion over the next few years,

and most contracts for it have now been signed. Building on this achievement, we

expect the total of new contracts signed in 1986 to reach  5 billion; this will

represent an increase of more than 70% over the  2.9 billion figure for 1985 - itself

some  600 million higher than in the previous year. Such orders continue to

maintain a large number of jobs in the United Kingdom and have raised our share of

the world market to nearly 9%.

2. Many of our most significant defence export successes have come in what is

probably the most competitive market of all, the United States. The continuing

achievements of British exporters there are illustrated by the fact that the balance

of defence trade between our two countries has improved from a ratio of 4:1 in

favour of the United States in 1978 to just under 2:1 in recent years.

3. An important factor in British industry&apos;s success overseas has been the

continuing efforts of the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) and the

support given by staff of the PE. In a field in which our international competitors

are very active, the DESO helps to ensure that British firms are given the

assistance they need. Among other activities in 1986, the DESO again organised

the British Army Equipment Exhibition at Alder shot and participated in the

Farnborough Air Show, which is sponsored by the Society of British Aerospace

Companies. Both of these events, as well as the Royal Navy Equipment

Exhibition, which is to be held in September this year, clearly demonstrate the

breadth of the advanced capability of British defence manufacturers. PE staff

were particularly successful in promoting the sale of two Skynet 4 satellites in

1986. We believe that British defence manufacturers should be given continued

support in their efforts, subject to appropriate export controls, to ensure that they

can continue to supply our own Services with competitively-priced equipment.

BRITISH PARTICIPATION IN THE SDI RESEARCH PROGRAMME

524. Last year&apos;s Statement outlined the arrangements for British participation

in the US SDI research programme, including the signature of the bilateral US/UK

Memorandum of Understanding and the establishment of the SDI Participation

Office (SDIPO) in the Ministry of Defence.

525. The SDIPO provides the focus within Government for promoting a full

British involvement in the SDI research programme. Participation on a substantial

14

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

scale will bring both direct benefits and an understanding of the programme&apos;s

technical implications for future defence systems. The activities of the SDIPO

include: management of a comprehensive technical information exchange on a

government-to-government basis; and the provision of wide-ranging assistance to

British companies and research institutions in their efforts to secure SDI research

contracts. During 1986 the SDIPO was strengthened by the appointment of an

Industrial Support Director and a number of industrial consultants, all experienced

men coming from British companies to the SDIPO on loan for between one and two

years.

526. By the end of 1986 a total of $34 million of SDI research work had been

awarded to the United Kingdom, involving some 36 British companies and

academic institutions. This was an encouraging start to the first year of British

participation. A total of some 400 British companies, and about 100 academic

bodies, are now registered as interested in seeking SDI research business. Of the

awards made in 1986 the largest was the European Architecture Study: announced

in June 1986 and worth approximately $10 million, this study, which is scheduled

to continue through to May 1988, involves five separate research establishments

and 16 different companies. It is examining, from a British perspective, the threat

with which a strategic defensive system would have to cope in the European

theatre. Additional awards, involving eight British companies and valued at $1.9

million for a similar area of study, were announced in December 1986. These

represent a substantial British involvement in research into the systems that would

be necessary for the defence of Europe against ballistic missiles, within the

context of a strategic defence system.

527. The defence research establishments have been active, sometimes in

conjunction with British industry, in bringing US-funded work to the United

Kingdom, in particular in the fields of Battle Management/Command Control and

Communications, Electromagnetic Rail Gun and Countermeasures. Although all of

these work packages have been concluded on a government-to-government basis,

approximately 85% of the work in each study area was subsequently contracted out

by the Ministry to British companies.

528. The reduced SDI budget for the 1987 US fiscal year, and keen competition

for the business that exists, mean that British companies will need to work hard to

succeed. We believe the effort will be worthwhile; there are valuable contracts to

be won and potential for spin-off to other high technology fields.

ROYAL ORDNANCE PLC

529. [Although substantial progress had been made towards transforming Royal

Ordnance into a fully fledged commercial entity, it was not possible to take this

far enough, and to have in place all the features necessary, for a successful

flotation last summer. Privatisation remains our aim, and last July we announced

our intention of transferring the company to the private sector by means of private

sale. As part of the continuing process of rationalisation and reorganisation within

the company the Royal Ordnance Board decided, with Government approval, to sell

the Leeds tank-manufacturing factory to Vickers pic, and the transaction was

completed last October. Firm proposals were received in March from British

CHAPTER SIX : MANAGING DEFENCE RESOURCES

THi DEFENCE BUDGET

601. The defence budget for 1987-88 is  18,782 million. Apart from minor

adjustments, this is unchanged from the cash provision announced in the 1986

Public Expenditure White Paper. The budget includes provision of  257 million for

Falklands costs, compared with  435 million in 1986-87. Similarly, the defence

budget for 1988-89 also remains as agreed last year at  18,980 million. Planned

provision for 1989-90 is some  19,470 million, an increase of approximately  490

million over the previous year.

602. A breakdown of the defence budget by main areas of expenditure is shown

in Figure 8, while Figure 9 analyses defence resources by major programmes. An

illustration of the cost of our main commitments has been introduced at Figure 10.

As Figure 11 shows, in both absolute terms, as a percentage of gross domestic

product and per capita, the British defence budget continues to be among the

highest in NATO.

603. On current inflation assumptions, and taking into account the latest

forecast of spending in 1986-87, the defence budget is expected to decline by some

5% in real terms over the 1986 Public Expenditure Survey period, broadly levelling

out in 1989-90. This decline will be partly offset by falling Falklands costs.

Nevertheless, as explained in last year&apos;s Statement, the ending of the commitment

to maintain real growth inevitably means that difficult choices have to be made

between relative priorities in our forward plans. Moreover, the cash demands of

the committed programme must determine the rate at which new commitments

can be accepted, within the agreed resources. That said, given the real growth

achieved from 1978-79 to 1985-86, from which we continue to benefit substantially

despite the current decline, we can maintain our main defence roles, though it will

remain important to exercise restraint and vigorously to pursue good management

and improvements in output.

VALUE FOR MONEY

604. Obtaining better value for the money spent on defence remains an

important aim, and recent Statements have described the major reforms that we

have introduced to this end. Progress on a number of these measures, including the

application of greater competition and collaboration in the procurement of defence

equipment, is described in Chapter 5. Progress in other areas is described below.

Transferring Resources from Tail to Teeth

605. Our defence ultimately depends on the strength and efficiency of our

front-line troops. To do their job properly they rely on a range of support

activities, from the supply of ammunition and maintenance of equipment to the

provision of pay and catering services. Our aim has been to provide that support

(the &apos;tail&apos;) as cost-effectively as we can so as to enable the maximum possible

resources to be released to the front line (the &apos;teeth&apos;).

Since 1979 we have cut the number of UK-based civilian staff by

about 81,000, a reduction of some 33%. Further reductions will be

sought by a continuing programme of economy measures and con-

tracting out. Taking account of the transfer of the Royal Dockyards

to commercial management (see paragraphs [620 and 621]) our aim is

to reduce the number of our civilian employees to about 148,000 by

1 April 1988. If possible we shall improve on this figure.

The Royal Navy has reduced its uniformed strength by 7,200 since the

publication of The Way Forward in 1981 and has pared back its

support area. As a result, some 70% of uniformed manpower is now

devoted to the front line and its direct support.

The Army&apos;s Lean Look programme has identified 4,000 uniformed

support posts that could be cut, amalgamated, filled by civilians, or

put out to contract, thus releasing military personnel for duty in the

front line. We plan to achieve this target by 1990; among other things

it will release manpower for the new armoured regiment forming in

BAOR next year.

Since 1984 the RAF has released a further 1,700 posts from the

support area in the fields of catering, aircraft-servicing and supply.

Recent examples are servicing and supply functions at RAF Shawbury

and support posts in University Air Squadrons, both of which have

been put out to contract.

These figures, which are provisional, have been compiled

from NATO sources except for the UK and Spain, which are

compiled from national sources. Total expenditure and per

rates, which do not necessarily reflect the relative purchasing

Power of individual currencies and so are not a complete

guide to comparative resource allocation.


CONFIDENTIAL

Financial Management

606. The Government&apos;s aim to improve the way in which Whitehall manages its

resources led to the launch of the Financial Management Initiative in 1983, the

aims of which were set out in Cmnd 9058. The Ministry of Defence has played its

full part in this effort.

607. Following an internal survey last year, procedures in the fourth (1986)

round of MINIS (the Department-wide management information system for

Ministers and top management) were extensively modified to increase the emphasis

on efficiency measures and to provide a comprehensive top management review.

Stress is being laid on three management principles:

aims and responsibilities must be clear, and authority must match

responsibility;

management must be accountable;

authority must be delegated to the greatest possible extent.

Our aims will include moving work into the private sector wherever it is cost-

effective and consistent with operational needs to do so.

608. The introduction of Staff Responsibility Budgets (SRBs) and Executive

Responsibility Budgets (ERBs) is proceeding as planned:

SRBs for personnel and some personnel-related costs now cover 98%

of UK-based civilian staff and some 18% of Service personnel in the

support field - an annual expenditure of  1.6 billion.

The three-year implementation programme for ERBs in the main-

tenance and support areas continues. In 1987-88 over 300 units with

annual operating costs of about  3.5 billion will have budgets.

In 1987-88 there will be a programme of pilot schemes aimed at

testing out higher-level ERBs (which will include headquarters costs)

in a number of management areas. In addition, it has been decided

that ERBs should be brought more fully within the cash management

system, and the necessary work is in hand.

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

609. Both ERBs and MINIS require the setting of specified objectives and

measurement of performance against them. Considerable attention is being paid to

the development of improved performance indicators (which are already used for

day-to-day management purposes). Additionally, a number of value-for-money

targets have been set, for example for disposing of married quarters, reducing

stock holdings and improving energy efficiency.

610. The introduction of a comprehensive corporate plan and related Financial

and Management Information System for the Quartermaster General&apos;s Department

is another initiative in this field. The plan sets out aims and targets for a pro-

gressive improvement in efficiency in the Army support area, performance being

monitored through a computerised system. Corresponding systems for other areas

of the Ministry are under consideration.

611. To integrate these management initiatives, and in line with the aims of

Cmnd 9058, the Financial Planning and Management Group (FPMG) - the senior

body in the Ministry of Defence responsible for management of resources - has

extended its role to cover management strategy and performance. A joint civilian

and military Financial Management Development Unit has been created to provide

support to the FPMG in this role. It has begun a major study into the Department&apos;s

future management strategy, including such matters as the coverage of the

budgetary systems and the precise nature of the FPMG&apos;s new management role.

PERSONNEL

The Services

612. Recruitment to the Services continues to be generally satisfactory. There

remain shortfalls of both officers and other ranks in certain specialist areas, where

competition with the civil sector for scarce skills continues unabated; nevertheless,

most recruiting targets are being met. We have achieved some 91% of target for

entry into officer training and over 99% for other ranks in 1985-86. We expect

that over the next few years the recruiting of other ranks may become more

difficult as the population in relevant age groups falls.

613. The level of voluntary outflow by officers is still a cause for concern in

some areas, but in general terms is not critical, while for Servicemen the rate is

stabilising. The annual rate of applications from officers at December 1986 was

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

3.7% of the trained strength (compared with 5% in 1978-79 and 3.9% in December

1985), while the proportion of those who actually left was 3.2% (4% in 1978-79 and

3.4% at December 1985). Applications from Servicemen for premature voluntary

release were running at an annual rate of 3.1% of trained strength in December

1986 (as compared with 6.8% in 1978-79 and 3.4% at December 1985), with actual

exits at 2.8% (4.4% in 1978-79 and 2.8% at December 1985).

614. Recent studies into why Service personnel leave prematurely suggest that

the most common reason is the turbulence of Service life, and particularly its

effect on personal plans and the separation from home and family. Operational

commitments often make this unavoidable; steps are nevertheless being taken

wherever possible to improve matters, for example by extending tour lengths. The

results of studies on the attitudes of Service wives, which may contribute signifi-

cantly to a Serviceman&apos;s decision to end his career early, are being considered by

the Department. The studies recognise the need to alter the relationship that

exists between the Services and the wives of their personnel to reflect the changes

that have taken place in British society during the past 30 years.

615. The Government has maintained pay at a competitive level, and pay does

not generally appear to be a significant factor in decisions to leave the Services.

Our policy is to provide the appropriate conditions of service, taking account of the

particular circumstances of Service life, within the limits of justifiable public

expenditure. A comprehensive review of armed forces allowances is under way to

ensure that they remain appropriate to current conditions; in this context, a

Service Contract Scheme has been introduced providing improved arrangements at

a lower cost to the taxpayer for Service families moving their household goods on

posting. Other changes will be made where necessary to meet the developing needs

of the Services.

Civilians

  616. As we reported in last year&apos;s Statement, we are having difficulty in

recruiting and retaining certain categories of staff, in particular scientists and

engineers, and those in disciplines that are in short supply nationally, such as

accountancy, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and electronics. Problems are also

being experienced in the recruitment and retention of certain industrial craftsmen,

and of clerical and secretarial staff in London and a number of other areas,

5

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

predominantly in the south of England. Although the rate at which staff -

especially those with high potential - are leaving the Department is slightly down

on last year, the situation is still causing considerable concern.

617.     The steps that we are taking to improve matters include:

special pay additions targeted on skills for which recruitment and

retention are particularly difficult;

improvements to the structures of the Professional and Technology

Group, and of the Secretarial and Clerical support grades, which have

resulted in pay increases for many of these staff;

increases in, and extension of eligibility for, accountancy and ADP

allowances;

special payments to certain high quality scientific recruits;

introduction of the Defence Engineering Service (see [below]).

The effect that these measures are having in securing the staff we need to main-

tain the defence programme is being closely monitored. Initial signs are encourag-

ing.

DEFENCE ENGINEERING SERVICE

1. Engineers play a key role in the procurement of defence equipment and in

ensuring value for money from the  8 billion spent annually on equipment for the

Services. The Ministry of Defence employs some 14,000 civilian engineering speci-

alists in this field, of whom some 2,000 are professionally qualified. They are

involved in all aspects of the procurement cycle from initial concept through to in-

service support. To ensure that their skills and abilities match the changing needs

of the work, we are making a number of radical changes in their management.

2. We have established a new Defence Engineering Service (DES), which brings

together in a single professional group all the civilian engineering specialists in the

Ministry of Defence working on defence systems and equipment. We have done so

because:

6

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

the nature of the work has changed considerably. Much detailed design

and supervision has been devolved to industry, while the projects that

the Ministry has to manage are becoming increasingly large and

complex. This more predominantly managerial role requires our

engineers to have greater breadth and depth of expertise to oversee

both the business and technical aspects of contractors&apos; work.

the spread of technologies with applications across the range of

equipment procurements is increasing, and while some specialisms

remain, electronics, for example, is increasingly applied across the

whole field.

the national scarcity of qualified engineers makes it imperative for the

Ministry of Defence to use to best effect those people it recruits, and

to offer a career that will encourage them to remain.

3. The DES will help to ensure the most productive use of our skilled

engineering specialists and improve their status, opportunities and career pros-

pects. A Head of Profession of the DES has been appointed, responsible for the

maintenance of professional standards and training and for representing the

interests of the Group at the highest levels. New personnel management systems

are being introduced, which aim to:

identify talent and ensure that all staff have the opportunity to develop

the limits of their potential;

remove artificial barriers to movement between line management

areas;

provide structured experience and training for future project managers;

give greater emphasis to technical and management training;

expand sponsorship of students reading for engineering degrees.

k. Plans are also well advanced for the recruitment of a small number of very

high calibre graduate engineers in 1987 to a new fast-stream career path. This

scheme offers individual career development and training, and accelerated promo-

tion prospects. Recruits will be comparable in ability and have similar career

prospects to the Administration Trainees recruited to the Administration group.

SECURITY

618. The need for cost-effective security is now probably more important than

ever before. To ensure that the aims of hostile intelligence services are thwarted

or made as difficult as possible demands a continual review of the threat and,

where necessary, re-deployment of our resources. Every breach of security

requires investigation and perhaps re-consideration of our security rules.

7

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

619.     There are three areas of particular concern:

The Terrorist Threat: Over the past few years increasing resources

have been devoted to countermeasures against terrorist attack. In

Great Britain, as an additional measure, regular security exercises

are now carried out by the three Services to test all aspects of units&apos;

counter-terrorist security arrangements.

Static Communications Units: The Security Commission Report of

October 1986 endorsed the action taken by those concerned with

tightening up security and made three further recommendations: on

exit searches, security records and the posting of young Servicemen

to such units. We are now implementing them in the most cost-

effective way.

ADP Security: This continues to increase in importance. Additional

resources are being devoted to safeguarding hardware and software

and to the protection of electronic emissions from eavesdropping.

THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE POLICE

1. The Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) can trace its origins back as far as

1686 when, on the advice of Samuel Pepys, the Special Commissioners of the Navy

appointed &apos;porters, rounders, warders and watchmen&apos; to guard the naval dockyards.

In 1841 the Metropolitan Police were called in to police two of the yards in their

district, and in 1860 they were authorised by Parliament to police all the principal

naval dockyards in England and Wales, as well as certain War Office establish-

ments. From 1860 police powers could be used up to 15 miles outside these places,

in respect of Crown property or of persons subject to military discipline.

Legislation was later introduced for similar establishments in Scotland and, on its

creation, for those of the RAF. But these additional duties eventually proved too

much for the Metropolitan Police and, in 1923, the Special Constables Act

authorised the Service Councils to form their own police forces. The responsibili-

ties of these forces were extended by subsequent legislation to include all military

premises in the United Kingdom and still later to premises occupied by visiting

forces.

2. The Force in its present form was established in October 1971, when the

separate Admiralty, Army Department and Air Force Constabularies were united

under the command of a single chief constable. In 1984, there was a further

extension of their employment outside MOD premises by an Act that had the effect

of extending the 1860 and 1923 Acts to the premises of the privatised factories of

Royal Ordnance pic. In the same year, an enquiry by the House of Commons

Defence Committee drew attention to the difficulty the MDP was experiencing in

fulfilling these tasks with the resources available. We therefore commissioned an

independent and wide-ranging study to formulate a long-term strategy for the

Force&apos;s future role, composition and size.   The MDP Police Review Committee

8

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

published its report, known as the Broadbent Report, as Cmnd 9853 in July 1986.

The Government&apos;s response was announced in the House of Commons on 25 July

1986.

3. As a result of the Broadbent report, changes have been made in the

management and organisation of the Force. The Ministry of Defence Police Act

1987 received the Royal Assent in March. It rationalises the powers of the MDP

and provides a statutory basis for the Defence Police Federation. A MDP

Committee has been appointed and has held its first meeting. Arrangements are

being made for an inspection of the Force by Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate of

Constabulary. MDP liaison officers have been appointed to a Command

headquarters of each of the three Services in the United Kingdom. Work continues

on other recommendations, notably amplifying the instructions on the roles of

commanding officers, senior security officers and senior MDP officers, the comple-

menting criteria for MDP posts, a MDP budget, the provision of MDP services to

bodies outside the Ministry of Defence, and a possible special constable scheme.

We welcome these changes in the management of the Force, and believe they will

ensure that the MDP is better able to carry out the duties required of it.

4. The 5,000 or so men and women of the current Force are increasingly in the

public eye and display both dedication and professionalism. Of the threats that

they help to counter, protest demonstrations and marches are no new phenomenon

at defence establishments: the first Aldermaston march was held in April 1958.

But it was not until these became more outwardly aggressive at the beginning of

the 1980s that the presence and role of the MDP received wide publicity. Since

then this kind of protest activity has increased dramatically. In 1979-80 MDP

officers were involved in two such events; in the following 12 months, 29; and in

1985-86 the number had increased to over 700.

5. In these tasks and all others that we require the MDP to carry out, they

acknowledge the prime responsibility of Home Department police forces for the

enforcement of the law. They are, of course, always ready to assist other forces

when Ministry of Defence interests are involved.

ROYAL DOCKYARDS

620. [Since last year&apos;s Statement we have made considerable progress with plans

to introduce commercial management to the two Royal Dockyards at Devonport

and Rosyth. The Dockyard Services Bill received Royal Assent on 25 July 1986 and

came into effect on 26 September. A number of bids for the contracts to manage

the Dockyards were received in response to the Ministry&apos;s Invitations to Tender,

and these were evaluated by a Tender Board, supported by a team of officials and

consultants. Following further detailed consideration of the bids, and after taking

fully into account the views expressed by the Trades Unions, we signed term

contracts with Babcock Thorn Limited on 27 January for the future operation of

Rosyth Dockyard, and with Devonport Management Limited on 24 February in

respect of Devonport Dockyard. Both contracts are planned to run for seven years

from 6 April 1987.

9

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

621. We also formed for each Dockyard separate companies to be the employer

of the local management and workforce, and to which the licence to use the

Dockyard assets could be granted. Those companies would then be taken over by

Babcock Thorn Limited and Devonport Management Limited respectively and by

any other subsequent contractors, as necessary, for the duration of the term

contracts. The Secretary of State would continue to hold a special share in each of

the employing Dockyard companies.]

DEFENCE MEDICAL SERVICES

622. Last year we reported that we were studying the possibility of putting out

to contract work currently undertaken by uniformed and civilian dental techni-

cians, as well as the direct supply of drugs to hospitals. The dental technicians

study has been completed and, with the exception of certain key posts that will be

filled by Service personnel to meet the war role, all dental technical work will be

put out to contract from May this year, with a saving of 79 uniformed and 22

civilian posts and a net annual reduction in costs of about  125,000. The direct

supply of drugs to hospitals is still under consideration.

AIDS AND THE ARMED FORCES

1. With growing evidence of the threat posed by AIDS, the Ministry of Defence

recognises that the armed forces are no less at risk than any other section of the

community from the spread of the disease around the world. An internal working

party, including medical, legal, Service and policy staffs, was established in March

1986, charged with making proposals for preventive education and publicity and on

personnel policy aspects of AIDS. Its first task was, as a matter of urgency, to

concentrate on preventive education and publicity. Its recommendations were:

wide distribution of posters to Service units, to be prominently dis-

played;

wide distribution of the Health Education Council booklet, AIDS - What

Everybody Needs to Know;

comprehensive briefing by medical staffs of units serving, or about to

deploy, overseas; and

incorporation of AIDS warnings into all drug education briefings.

10

CONFIDENTIAL


I CONFIDENTIAL

2. These recommendations are being implemented. Some 11,000 posters have

been distributed to Service units; 330,000 copies of the Health Education Council

booklet have been given to all Service men and women personally; and 161,000

copies of the DHSS leaflet, AIDS: Don&apos;t die of Ignorance, are being provided for

unmarried personnel in barracks, aboard ship and serving overseas, who would not

otherwise have received it. In addition to all this, the central medical staffs are

taking appropriate precautions in routine procedures, for example by screening

blood supplies for use at home and abroad, and arranging for panels of safe donors

to provide emergency supplies in certain areas overseas.

3. There are no illusions in the armed forces as to the potential threat from

AIDS. The working party will remain in being to monitor developments both

nationally and internationally, and will continue to recommend to senior manage-

ment and Ministers such steps as are judged necessary to safeguard the health of

all our personnel.

HIGHER DEFENCE STUDIES

623. In addition to sponsoring Defence Fellowships and Service and civilian

attendance on university post-graduate courses, the Ministry of Defence both runs

and participates in a number of seminars and conferences with the academic world.

Last autumn we held our first regional seminar, in cooperation with the University

of Aberystwyth. Another major development in 1986 was the establishment of a

Defence Lectureship at the Centre for Russian and East European Studies,

University of Birmingham. This lectureship, the sixth currently funded by the

Ministry, will specialise in Soviet defence studies.

THE DEFENCE ESTATE

624. The defence estate exists to meet the Services&apos; needs for accommodation,

operational bases, support facilities and training areas. Details of its composition

are given in Tables 5.13 and 5.14 of Volume 2. Regular reviews ensure that our

land holdings are used efficiently and are no larger than necessary. Our continuing

programme of selling surplus property provides both savings in maintenance costs

and funds for use elsewhere, and specific targets for disposals were set for the first

time in 1985-86. Receipts in that year for land and buildings (including married

quarters) totalled some  60 million. In 1986-87 receipts of some  70 million are

expected against a target of just under  64 million. We must, however, acquire

more land when it is essential to meet specific requirements. There is, for

example, insufficient training land to meet the needs of the increased number of

regular and reserve units that have to be trained in this country. For this reason

we intend to purchase suitable land when it becomes available.

11

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

625. We take seriously our responsibility to conserve and improve the land used

for military purposes. The defence estate contains many areas of beautiful

countryside, and we put much effort into protecting the environment throughout

the estate. We try to encourage recreational use whenever safety and defence

needs permit. In many places, military use has protected land from development or

intensive cultivation, and so some defence sites have become very important

environmentally. Salisbury Plain Training Area, for example, contains more than

one third of the remaining chalk downland in southern England and some 1,700

archaeological monuments. To investigate ways of enhancing the protection given

to these monuments, an Archaeological Working Party was established in 1984, in

conjunction with English Heritage, the Nature Conservancy Council and County

Archaeologists. Their report, which was published in April 1986, was widely

praised and will lead to a. range of improvements in the management of this

important part of our heritage. In addition, the Maritime Heritage Area, which

will include HMS Victory, HMS Warrior, the Mary Rose, their museums and the

Royal Naval Museum Portsmouth, is being developed by charitable Trusts in a part

of Portsmouth Naval Base no longer needed for defence purposes.

Energy Efficiency

626. In last year&apos;s Statement we announced a new initiative to improve the

Ministry&apos;s energy efficiency, building on earlier improvements and taking advan-

tage of potential savings in running costs. A target has been set of a 25% reduc-

tion in expenditure ( 260 million in 1985-86) over five years on non-operational

energy. All sites on the defence estate are now required to have an Energy

Manager, and all should have had an energy survey by April 1991.

THE METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE

627. The Meteorological Office serves the armed forces as its largest single

user and, as the national meteorological service, provides free weather forecasts

and warnings to the public through the media. In addition, it supplies more

detailed information, on a repayment basis, tailored to the needs of specialised

users, including industry, commerce, the legal profession and, in particular, civil

aviation. Nearly one third of the cost of the Meteorological Office is met by these

repayment services, receipts from which totalled  21.8 million in 1985-86. The

Office has a marketing organisation actively seeking new business.

CONFIDENTIAL

628. The span of services provided to the community is wide, ranging from

advice on the likely directions in which an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease

might spread, to research into the effect of atmospheric pollutants on the climate.

The Office has continued to improve the range of its services over the last year.

The United Kingdom weather radar network has been expanded by means of colla-

borative arrangements with some Water Authorities, who have a close interest in

prompt reaction to forecasts of rain. And specialised warnings of freezing road

conditions are being made available to a number of Local Authorities, enabling

them to save money by reducing the need for precautionary road-gritting opera-

tions.

629. Improvements in the range and accuracy of weather forecasts are under-

pinned by a tautly managed research programme, aimed at better meeting the

requirements of defence, civil and commercial customers alike. The main areas of

research include development of a very fine-scale numerical forecasting model,

refinement of weather radar inputs and exploitation of new satellite information.

630. The continuing search for economies has led to further rationalisation in

Meteorological Office support to the RAF. Concentration of services at some key

airfields has permitted the closure of sections in Scotland (Pitreavie), the south

west of England (Mount Batten) and central southern England (Upavon). This has

been achieved only on the clear understanding that Air Force operational integrity

is not put at risk.

PUBLIC RELATIONS

631. Doors opened to the media during the year included those of the Chemical

Defence Establishment at Porton Down, RAF Greenham Common, and the Aero-

plane and Armaments Research Establishment at Boscombe Down. The programme

has also included facilities on board the ships of the round-the-world Royal Navy

deployment, GLOBAL 86; a press party visit to the out-of-area exercise SAIF

SAREEA in Oman; and media coverage of the NATO exercise BOLD GUARD in

Denmark and the Federal Republic of Germany (See Chapter 4). We hope that

these visits, and many others, have led to a greater understanding of the role of the

Services and their support establishments and have served to dispel the false air of

mystery surrounding some of the places and issues involved.

632. We are also making greater efforts to reach the public direct. For

example, proposals to modernise the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System site at

Fylingdales in Yorkshire were explained to both the community and the press in a

series of briefings. Similarly, the progress of development at Molesworth - the

second United Kingdom cruise missile base - and at the Clyde Submarine Base were

the subject of parallel community and press briefings.

633. Publications, exhibitions and films offer further means of reaching the

public. An illustrated booklet describing British defence policy is now produced to

coincide with publication of this annual Statement and is distributed free. A

revised exhibition about NATO and British defence policy was mounted last year at

eight sites and proved very successful. A new film - Keeping the Peace - setting

out the case for deterrence has been made and will, we hope, make a significant

contribution to public understanding of defence issues.

ANNEX A : THE FORCES OF EAST AND WEST

CONVENTIONAL FORCES

1. One important side-effect of the Reykjavik summit was to focus attention on

the conventional balance of forces between East and West. Reductions, or

potential reductions, in nuclear weapons make it all the more important to tackle

conventional disparities, as the Prime Minister and President Reagan agreed at

Camp David last November.

CALCULATING THE CONVENTIONAL BALANCE

1. Calculating the comparative conventional strengths of NATO and the Warsaw

Pact is a complex task. The simplest accounts are those restricted to numbers of

personnel, formations or items of equipment on each side. As we explained in last

year&apos;s Statement, even these are difficult to carry out. But when it comes to more

sophisticated assessments, there are many more problems.

2. Some sources express the balance in terms of manpower division equivalents

(MDE): the manpower totals in major combat units are divided by the strength of a

standard US armoured division (18,300 men) to produce the MDE total. While this

method has the merit of simplicity, it takes no account of the organisation and

combat power of the forces in question: Warsaw Pact divisions usually consist of

fewer personnel than many NATO divisions but contain more tanks and artillery; so

this system would tend to underestimate their real strength.

3. Other analysts attempt to take into account organisation and combat power,

mobility, firepower and survivability of individual weapons, to produce for any

given unit a weighted unit value, which can then be expressed in terms of armoured

division equivalents (ADE). Assessments of individual weapon-effectiveness ratings

are, however, inevitably subjective. Moreover, key weapon systems (for example

attack helicopters and anti-aircraft artillery) are included by some authorities but

not by others.

4. Many other factors also need to be taken into account in a full net assess-

ment, including:

a. Preparedness: the availability of forces ultimately depends on their

degree of readiness and how easy their mobilisation and reinforcement plans

are to implement. The sustainability of forces depends on the quantity and

survivability of logistic stocks, and on supply lines of fuel, ammunition, and

spares. NATO&apos;s reinforcement and re-supply from North America would, for

example, face a 6,000 km Atlantic crossing; the Warsaw Pact&apos;s supply lines

are comparatively short and are overland.

b. Geography, terrain, and environment: NATO forces in the Central

Region defend a long common border. There are few natural obstacles in the

region; and the dense population, in many towns and cities, further compli-

cates both offence and defence. Force requirements differ from those in the

1

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Northern Region, which has difficult mountainous terrain that is snow-

covered in winter and becomes marshy in summer, and whose flank is the

desolate polar region. Requirements in the South are different again: this

region is linked by the Mediterranean Sea, and there is a common border in

difficult mountainous terrain, with the politically troubled North Africa and

Middle East on the flank.

c. Organisation and doctrine: Soviet doctrine emphasises offensive mobi-

lity, surprise and deception. Ground forces have a pre-eminent role. The

Soviet Union also has two branches of the armed forces separately tasked

with strategic attack and strategic defence. There are, in addition, dif-

ferences in political organisation, allied cohesion, training, leadership and

morale that would affect the outcome of any conflict.

5. There is so much scope for the exercise of judgement and opinion in assessing

factors such as these that attempts to do so rarely command universal approval.

We do not therefore seek here to make a complete net assessment but concentrate

on producing a number count which, though necessarily simplified and restricted in

scope, does at least seek to apply equal criteria to both sides.

Land and Air Forces

2. In Europe - the area that most directly affects our security - the evidence is

of a preponderance of military force in favour of the Warsaw Pact. This is

illustrated in Figure 12, which shows the conventional forces of NATO and the

Warsaw Pact in place in the Central Region - that is, NATO forces in the Benelux

countries and the Federal Republic of Germany; and Warsaw Pact forces estimated

to be in Poland, Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic.

3. Figure 13 gives a broader picture of conventional forces in place from the

Atlantic to the Urals. This is an area with no agreed definition, but for the

purposes of this Statement we have included those forces located in the 14 NATO

countries in Europe, and Warsaw Pact forces in Eastern Europe and the 11 military

districts of the Soviet Union west of the Ural mountains. The purpose of this

illustration is to give a clearer view of the relative strengths of troops and equip-

ment available in Europe, including troops that could be deployed quickly (say

within a week) to the Central Front, or which could be involved early in any

fighting on the Northern and Southern Flanks.

4. By any objective measure the superiority of Warsaw Pact land and air forces

is substantial. Furthermore, any potential aggressor can select the time and place

of his attack, and exploit this advantage by massing his forces to achieve over-

whelming local superiority in numbers; while a defender such as NATO, committed

not to be the first to use force, can only seek to respond before his defence is

irretrievably disrupted. Moreover the Warsaw Pact enjoys geographical

advantages: it can move supplies to the front more easily than NATO, most of

whose reinforcements of men, equipment and materiel face a long and hazardous

Atlantic crossing; and it knows that NATO, with its limited territory and

commitment to forward defence, cannot trade space for time so as to concentrate

against a main Warsaw Pact attack. These constraints compound the conventional

imbalance faced by the Alliance.

Developments in Warsaw Pact Forces

5. The steady improvement in the organisation, training, equipment, and offen-

sive capability of Soviet forces has continued apace during the last year. NATO&apos;s

technological lead in many areas continues to be eroded. In particular, many of the

new Soviet ground forces equipments are at least as sophisticated as their Western

equivalents, and a wider variety of equipment is being introduced. Improvements

during the last year include new armoured vehicles (among them T-80 and T-64B

tanks, BTR-80 armoured personnel carriers and BMP-2 infantry combat vehicles),

artillery, tactical surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems and more accurate short-

range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles (SRBM) armed with improved, conven-

tional warheads. Such improvements would facilitate rapid and deep thrusts into

opposing defences. The new Frogfoot (fixed-wing) and Hind (rotary-wing) aircraft

have been deployed in the forward area in support of ground troops. The Soviet

Union is making considerable investment in its command, control, and communica-

tions (C3) infrastructure; and development continues of an already elaborate

system of hardened command post and re-location systems for the survival of civil

and military leaders. The introduction of High Commands of Forces, as an

intermediate level of authority between the General staff and front-line

commands, has enhanced both the operational flexibility and responsiveness of the

Warsaw Pact&apos;s forces.

6. Soviet air forces are being similarly improved. New agile fighters, Fulcrum

and Flanker, armed with their new AA-10 missiles, have a true look-down/shoot-

down capability, which will improve Soviet defences against aircraft and, to some

extent, cruise missiles flying at low altitude. They will be supported by deploy-

ment of the Mainstay airborne warning and control system and Midas tanker air-

craft. SAM defences supported by new ground-based radars and communication

systems are being modernised. The SA-10 SAM, which has some capability against

low-altitude targets with a small radar cross-section, is being increasingly deployed

in defence of Moscow and other key military and industrial centres. There are

indications of further organisational changes to improve the effectiveness of the

air defence forces.

7. Modern military systems are highly dependent on advanced electronics for

sensors, communications, weapons control and data processing. The Soviet Union

has problems in the volume production of some integrated circuits and computers,

in which it lags several years behind the West. Nonetheless, there is a very active

radar research and development (R &amp; D) programme continually developing new

systems; and the Soviet armed forces are improving their ability to counter homing

missiles by the employment of a wide range of electronic countermeasures (ECM),

jammers and suppressors, and decoy measures. The emphasis in CJ remains on

redundancy and security, increasing use being made of computer systems and

automated data aids, as well as satellite communications and land-lines, including

secure fibre optics. The use of extremely low frequency to communicate with

submerged submarines is also practised. Problems in the electronics industry,

particularly in production, will slow down the introduction of new technologies into

Soviet military systems but not necessarily impair systems performance.

NATO Forces

8. NATO countries continue with plans to introduce new equipment into the

inventories of their ground forces, both through replacement programmes and addi-

tional purchases. Some 275 main battle tanks of the advanced Leopard II and

Challenger types are being introduced this year. In addition, large numbers of

tanks currently in service are being upgraded by, for example, the fitting of

improved fire-control systems. Among other armoured vehicles coming into

service are some 150 new armoured personnel carriers.

9. Anti-armour capabilities are being enhanced through the introduction of

almost 400 new missile launchers of the TOW type and of some&apos; 13,500 hand-held

anti-armour missiles. The ability of forces to defend themselves against air attack

will be improved with the introduction of 725 advanced missile systems, including

some 550 of the Stinger/Javelin type. Operational and tactical flexibility is being

increased by the introduction of over 40 helicopters, both combat and transport,

and a small number of fixed-wing transport aircraft.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

10. NATO air forces plan to introduce over 170 new aircraft in 1987; most are

combat aircraft, predominantly Tornado and F-16 types. Existing aircraft also

continue to be updated. Sustainability in areas such as war stocks of chaff and

flare decoys is being improved. Patriot SAM deployments in the Central Region

will greatly strengthen air defences in Europe over the next few years. Airfield

local defence will be strengthened as more than 50 new short-range SAM systems

are brought into service. Total NATO numbers of aircraft and SAMs will, however,

remain low compared to the threat.

Maritime Forces

11. Figure 14 shows the principal naval forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact

normally located or based in the North Atlantic and seas bordering Europe. Ships

and submarines could be deployed anywhere in this area, but naval forces have been

divided according to sea or fleet areas relating to home bases.

12. This picture of the balance at sea needs qualification. Taken as a whole,

NATO outnumbers the Warsaw Pact in surface ships. But we cannot ignore the

realities of geography and the nature and distribution of the forces deployed by

each side. For NATO in-place maritime forces are outnumbered in offensive

systems, particularly submarines and bombers, in the Eastern Atlantic. And it is

here, and in the shallow seas, that the threat is greatest to NATO&apos;s reinforcement

and re-supply lines, which are so important to the defence of Europe. As the last

war demonstrated, relatively few submarines can do great damage. And the

potential threat from the Soviet submarine fleet today is immeasurably greater

than that posed by enemy submarines at the outbreak of the Second World War.

The conventional wisdom requiring an attacker to outnumber a defender on land is

reversed, in anti-submarine warfare, and in consequence proportionately larger

numbers of surface escorts, hunter-killer submarines, and aircraft can be needed to

defend shipping.

Developments in Warsaw Pact Naval Forces

13. The last year has seen a continuation of the major building programme of

both submarines and surface ships. In addition to those carrying ballistic missiles

(see paragraph [16]), submarine construction includes the Oscar class, each boat

armed with 24 SS-N-19 anti-ship cruise missiles with a range of 550 kms, at least

two classes of powerful, fast and silent nuclear-powered attack submarine (Sierra

and Akula), and the Kilo class diesel-powered attack submarine. Surface warships

have become larger and more sophisticated, with longer range and greater fire-

power, and include the first unit of a new class of large aircraft carrier, currently

fitting out in the Black Sea area. Other classes being built include the nuclear-

powered Kirov and the Slava class guided-missile cruisers, the Sovremenny and

Udaloy class guided-missile destroyers and several other classes of frigate,

corvette, and patrol craft.

NATO Maritime Forces

14. NATO&apos;s maritime capability is being significantly improved through the

introduction of new and more capable ships and by improved equipment and weapon

systems, including radars, sonars, ECM and communications. The US Navy is

continuing its programme to increase its strength to about 600 ships. Some 30 new

helicopters will also join the NATO navies next year in anti-submarine and airborne

early warning roles, while helicopters and aircraft currently in service will be

modernised, including the fitting of air-to-air refuelling links and advanced

electronic warfare equipment.

NUCLEAR FORCES

CALCULATING THE NUCLEAR BALANCE

1. Many similar problems apply in calculating the nuclear as the conventional

balance. Factors such as relative accuracy, reliability, reaction time and surviv-

ability are difficult to quantify, not least since detailed information about capa-

bilities is seldom disclosed. The location, mobility and vulnerability of weapon

systems, and the existence of defensive forces, are further complicating factors.

2. So again a straight number count has the merit of providing an objective basis

against which judgements can be exercised. But there are still problems about

what to count. It might be more realistic to consider warheads rather than

weapons systems, but:

many strategic missiles are capable of carrying varying numbers of

multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), and

although we know the maximum number of warheads a missile is able to

carry, we do not know how many are actually carried;

aircraft can carry a variety and variable number of weapons;

most shorter-range missiles and all artillery pieces can be re-loaded; we

do not know how many re-loads are available;

6

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

most aircraft, shorter-range missiles and artillery are dual-capable, and

many could be armed with conventional instead of nuclear warheads.

The comparisons we make are therefore mostly based on launcher numbers, except

for longer-range intermediate nuclear forces, for which an approximate balance

can be shown.

3. There remains the problem of comparing like with like. Our division of

nuclear systems into categories is to some extent arbitrary, and the Soviet Union

normally uses different terminology. But our approach broadly reflects the varying

capabilities and roles of different systems and is in line with the categories

generally used in arms control negotiations and agreements.

Strategic Forces

15. Strategic forces, as defined in SALT II, are those whose range or type of

delivery system allows them to undertake intercontinental attack. They include

intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles

(SLBMs) and heavy bombers equipped with bombs and air-launched cruise missiles

(ALCMs). Sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) are also included because the

range of their launch platforms gives them a potential for intercontinental attack.

16. The Soviet Union and the United States have, over the past year, continued to

modernise their strategic forces. At the end of 1986 the Soviet Union had deployed

81 of its mobile ICBMs, the SS-25. And another ICBM, the SS-X-24, which is

expected to carry ten warheads and may be deployed both in silos and on mobile

launchers, is at an advanced stage of development. The capability of the Soviet

SLBM force is being markedly improved as more of the new Typhoon and Delta

class submarines (SSBNs) are deployed, with their SS-N-20 and SS-N-23 missiles.

There are two submarine-launched land-attack cruise missiles in development, the

SS-NX-21 and the larger SS-NX-24. The SS-NX-21 (with a range of over 2,500 kms)

is expected to be deployed in the near future from a variety of submarines. The

number of ALCMs in the inventory is increasing, with the entry into service of

more of the new variant of the Bear bomber. Development of the new strategic

aircraft, the Blackjack, is well under way.

17. The Soviet Union continues to improve its ground-based radars and space

sensors for ballistic missile detection and threat assessment. It is also continuing

research and development with potential application to ballistic missile defence.

18. As part of its strategic force modernisation programme, the United States

has begun to deploy the Bl bomber and the new ten-warhead MX ICBM. The eighth

US Trident submarine with C4 missiles is now on sea trials, and by the end of the

decade the US 5LBM capability will be further improved with the introduction into

service of the D5 Trident SLBM. Engineering design work on a single-warhead

mobile ICBM is in progress. The effectiveness of the B52 bomber force is being

enhanced as the aircraft are modified to carry ALCMs. Development programmes

for an advanced-technology bomber and an advanced cruise missile are under way.

Both are planned to incorporate stealth technology. SLCMs are being deployed on

a variety of ships and submarines.

19. Figure 15 illustrates the balance of strategic systems. The Soviet Union has

more strategic delivery systems than the United States although, when aircraft-

delivered weapons are included, the United States probably has the advantage, with

some 11,500 warheads compared to 10,500 deployed by the Soviet Union. But as

explained [above] it is very difficult to estimate the number of warheads deployed

with any accuracy. Interpretation of the balance is further complicated by the

asymmetry between the two sides&apos; forces. For example, the Soviet Union - with a

preponderance of ICBMs and three times the missile throw-weight available to the

United States - could successfully attack all US land-based missiles while keeping

part of its ICBM force intact. On the other hand, half the US warheads are

deployed on SLBMs which, though less accurate than ICBMs, are virtually invulner-

able to a first strike, leaving the United States with a certain capability to

retaliate. Finally, a comprehensive reckoning of the balance needs to take account

of extensive Soviet strategic defences, both active and passive, including the anti-

ballistic missile (ABM) system around Moscow (the only such operational system in

the world), which is being upgraded.

Intermediate and Short-Range Nuclear Forces

20. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact have a variety of systems that can deliver

nuclear weapons at less than intercontinental range. Intermediate nuclear forces

(INF) include all systems that fall between short-range and strategic, and can be

sub-divided into longer-range and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces

(LRINF and SRINF), the former having a range in excess of about 1,000 km. Short-

range nuclear forces include artillery and missiles with a range of less than about

150 km. They are sometimes known as &apos;battlefield&apos; weapons.

SRINF Aircraft. This diagram shows all aircraft of types known to have a nuclear-capable variant. On the NATO side, the number

assigned to the nuclear role is indicated by the coloured part of the column .The other aircraft shown are not assigned to the nuclear role ,

and could not be so used.The Warsaw Pact does not disclose similar information about its own aircraft, and it is not possible to produce

reliable estimates. All Warsaw Pact aircraft of types known to be nuclear-capable are therefore shown.

Short-Range Artillery. This diagram shows all artillery pieces of types known to have a nuclear-capable variant. On the NATO side, the

number available for the nuclear role is indicated by the coloured parts of the column.The other artillery pieces included are not available

for use in the nuclear role. Similar information is not available for Warsaw Pact systems.

1 Includes land-based systems in Europe from the Urals westward.

2 French systems are not included in this diagram. They comprise 65 Mirage HIE and Jaguar aircraft and 30 Pluton missiles. The

diagram does not include maritime systems.


CONFIDENTIAL

21. The numbers of LRINF, SRINF and short-range forces shown in Figures 15

and 16 include only offensive land-based systems in Europe from the Urals

westward. They exclude:

aircraft and missiles based outside Europe, in the United States and

eastern USSR;

aircraft whose primary mission is maritime, such as those of the Soviet

naval air forces and NATO aircraft with an anti-ship role;

NATO sea-based nuclear systems, such as the Terrier surface-to-air

missile, the ASROC and SUBROC anti-submarine missiles, air-delivered

bombs and aircraft on US aircraft carriers;

Warsaw Pact sea-based systems, such as SS-N-3, SS-N-7, SS-N-12 and

SS-N-19 anti-ship cruise missiles, nuclear depth-bombs, surface-to-air

missiles, and SS-N-5 non-strategic ballistic missiles on submarines,

deployed in the Baltic Sea; and

air defence systems with a capability against air-breathing nuclear

delivery systems. This is an area of massive Warsaw Pact superiority.

They have, for example, almost 14,000 SAMs compared with NATO&apos;s

total of about 2,000.

Intermediate Nuclear Forces

22. At the end of 1986 NATO had deployed 208 ground-launched cruise missiles

(GLCM) and 108 Pershing II missiles in the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic

of Germany, Italy and Belgium. No additional GLCMs have been deployed to the

United Kingdom since the end of 1985, when the deployment of six flights of

GLCMs at RAF Greenham Common was completed. Numbers of SS-20 missiles

have remained at 441 but, with 112 SS-4 missiles and a total of 1,435 warheads, the

Soviet Union retains a substantial superiority over NATO in weapons of this range.

This is even more marked when aircraft, particularly the modern Backfire bomber,

are included. Similarly at shorter ranges the Warsaw Pact has a clear numerical

advantage.  Its missiles are also being improved as Scaleboard missiles have been

9

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

replaced over the past few years with a more accurate version (SS-22); and with

the introduction late in 1985 of the SS-23, a new missile that provides an improved

capability over the Scud, with longer range and greater accuracy. About 70

Scaleboard (S5-22) missiles are deployed west of the Urals; of these, up to 50 have

been deployed in the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslavakia since 1984.

23. The Warsaw Pact also maintains far greater numbers of dual-capable air-

craft which, like NATO&apos;s, are being modernised. A direct numerical comparison of

SRINF aircraft numbers is, however, difficult. Unlike NATO, the Warsaw Pact

does not disclose how many of its aircraft are assigned for nuclear operations; we

have therefore included in Figure 16 all Warsaw Pact shorter-range aircraft of

types that could deliver nuclear weapons. The number of NATO aircraft with a

nuclear role, 650, is indicated by the coloured part of the column; the other

aircraft shown, a further 750, are of similar types but are assigned for conventional

use and would not be used in the nuclear role. These additional aircraft have been

included for comparative purposes: even with their inclusion, the Warsaw Pact still

has a marked advantage.

Short-Range Nuclear Forces

24. The capability of Warsaw Pact short-range missiles is also being improved as

the SS-21 continues to replace the Frog missile. Improved artillery continues to be

deployed. As with tactical aircraft, artillery systems may also be dual-capable,

and, although we know how many NATO systems are available for use in nuclear

operations, we cannot be sure how many Soviet systems could similarly be used.

The numbers for Soviet artillery in Figure 16 therefore include all 1,600 newer

versions of the 152mm artillery system, and the 203mm and 240mm pieces, as well

as about 4,500 older 152mm guns, some of which may have a nuclear capability.

On the NATO side all 155mm and 203mm artillery that could be used to deliver

nuclear shells are shown in colour along with, for comparison purposes only,

another 3,000 pieces of the same types that are not available for use in the nuclear

role.

THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAMME

25. The Soviet Union is continuing to improve its already broad military

capability in space, encompassing surveillance, intelligence-gathering, communica-

tions, navigation and space-based R&amp;D.   Improved reconnaissance systems are

10

CONFIDENTIAL


( CONFIDENTIAL

believed to be under development in addition to a new global navigation system

with greater accuracy than existing systems. The Mir space station and its

associated modules will provide a flexible base for space R&amp;D. New launch

vehicles are being developed: a medium-lift vehicle that has already flown, and a

heavy-lift vehicle and re-usable shuttle orbiter that have yet to be launched.

There is continued heavy investment in space-related ground infrastructure which,

coupled with the introduction of a much expanded space-launch/transportation

capability, implies an even more rapid build-up in the future.

SOVIET DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

26. Soviet defence expenditure rose by about 50% in real terms between 1970 and

1985. The growth rate, which declined somewhat after the mid-1970s, picked up in

the early 1980s, and since then has averaged about 3% a year. The published Soviet

defence budget, a single line entry for defence, amounts to some 20 billion roubles

in 1987, and implies that the Soviet Union maintains its military forces on outlays

equivalent to little more than 2% of national output. But this is not credible, and

our estimates show the defence burden to be about 13-15% of gross domestic

product, substantially more by that measure than any NATO country. Current

developments in the defence sector suggest that expenditure could rise by about

3% a year between now and 1990. If the economy does not perform as well as Mr

Gorbachev hopes, there may be pressure to restrain the rise to below this level.

Nonetheless, the high priority traditionally given to defence seems unlikely to be

seriously challenged.
