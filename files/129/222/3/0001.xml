PENALTIES ON CARRIERS

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department

This memorandum/^lvvytes the Cabinet to agree that urgent legislation

should be introWuceo _ o impose penalties on carriers who bring to this

country people vxu(Cgut\isas who need them.    It takes account of the

discussion in Cabi\^ex^* \19 February and the Ministerial meeting chaired

by the Lord Pres iden^OTy24 February.

THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIC^X^

2. The threat to our itm^^^^^ion control from bogus refugees remains.

It threatens completely towjaia the considerable benefits which we have

secured by the imposition on&amp;M^on certain countries.    In December and

January alone over 300 Tamils\arviy d here seeking asylum.    Our action in

response to the latest influx o*^ y Tamils,  together with my speech on

20 February announcing that we wer /&lt;5&lt;Jns ider ing retrospective penalties on

carriers,  seems to have brought a lui ^ We are continuing our effort in

the courts to establish that we ar&amp;Senfdptled to send these 64 home, but

there is at present no sure foothold&lt;&amp; ^&amp;ris legal morass.    I am clear

that whatever the outcome in the courrS^Jmi need to act to deter airlines

from encouraging or conniving at this txAf&amp;Cc.    At the moment we are wide

open. VT

THE SCOPE OF LEGISLATION

3. I attach a paper summarising my thinking o/y^rTFrev scope of the

legislation.    It reflects the views at the Lord\^ELre)u4ent1 s meeting, in

particular the advice of the Solicitor General. O^y)

4. The Bill would provide power to impose a fixed a^rfM^y on carriers

who bring people to the United Kingdom without a valid/ tCs^s^port or other

identity document and, where one is required, without a^aVi^ visa. The

liability would not be retrospective, but would take effeey^^\Royal

Assent.    This follows the Solicitor-General&apos;s clear advicev^rotffcS

retrospection would lead to overthrow before the European OcViPC/p^ Human

Rights.    The penalty would be enforceable by civil action inTne^sSme sort

of way as detention and removal costs are already recovered frSm^a^riers.

We should not be obliged to impose the penalty in all cases - n^t^jwpuld


J\ be a matter for my diacretion - but the liability would ariae on the

^&apos;person&apos;s arrival in the United Kingdom and would not be affected by any

bsequent deciaion to grant the passenger entry.

v.v&apos;vf/ It would be necessary for the carriers to satisfy themselves that the

W^aot was valid and not a forgery,    I accept the view of the business

mMfag^y that the Bill should allow the carrier to argue, as he can in

8ome^linpKted circumstances under the Immigration Act at present,  that the

forgej^P^^i not &quot;reasonably apparent&quot;, but the onus would be on him to

es tabfeef^nis.    I recognise that this means that a decision to impose a

penalty ArvM?be open to review in the Courts if the carrier refuses to

pay-

INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS

6. We should ridjr^h acting alone by introducing this legislation. There

are similar pro\Ksiovs in other countries, including the USA, Canada and

West Germany.    FrcJO^wTTak we know of their experience, the provisions work

for them and seem AAa^^as an effective deterrent on carrying companies.

In practice, it is c^Sw&amp;m&amp;tively rare that a penalty has to be imposed.

7. Since the legislatTjajC^ouId not be retrospective, I do not consider

that it would fall foul of^CJrtDEuropean Convention on Human Rights. It

would, however, be necessa&lt;!v^ foenter a departure from the 1944 Chicago

Convention on International\vry/4/L.Aviation.

8. In the meantime,  I believ\\   .ahould continue to put pressure on

airlines to carry out fuller cheb^Won documents.    I have also written to

the Belgian Presidency asking t\iewllyo^sring to a conclusion in the next

few weeks the work which of f ic ials^tia^ ^&gt;een undertaking on asylum abuse.

TIMING &lt;y&gt;-A

- C^&lt;x

9. I do not believe we should wait foiv^fp^her crisis.    To do so would

reflect badly on our handling of the immrgxation control and would

undermine our firm and successful stance on visas.    It is difficult to

give an accurate forecast on the length of the Bill:  I expect it to be

about two or three clauses, but it will clearly be_controversial.    I do

not propose, however,  that it should be pushed tKrouVti as an emergency

measure. v-\/^n

10. Without retrospection we will be vulnerable to\ *^fersinfluxes as soon

as our intentions are announced, or if we let the tra^^^owvgo cold. We

do not want to wait long before the Bill is enacted.    l/fl*wft&gt;se that the

Bill should be drafted as a matter of urgency;  that if C^( i e  agrees to

the scheme I should announce our decision in a Pariiamentary^&amp;atement in

the afternoon of 26 February;  and that the Bill should be wJ^olWlced as

soon as possible after that.    I would hope that it could be ^g^j^H^a quick

passage through both Houses. &lt;&quot;^Cv


^\ CONCLUSION

I propose, therefore, that:

\&gt;&gt;^/  1.     Legislation should be urgently prepared on the lines set out in

^/ly^ I should announce the Government&apos;s intention in a Parliamentary

^^fc*ment on 26 February.

Z.l/J&amp;rk Bill should be introduced as soon as possible and

arrangements made to give it a quick passage through both Houses.

PENALTIES ON CARRIERS:    OUTLINE OF LEGISLATION

1. The Bill would provide power to impose a fixed penalty on

carriers who brought to the United Kingdom people who did not

have valid documentation. The penalty would be enforceable

through civil action.

2. The liability to pay the penalty would arise where a person

requiring leave to enter the United Kingdom arrived at the

immigration control without:

a) a valid passport with photograph or some other document

satisfactorily establishing identity and nationality or

citizenship; and

b) a   valid   visa   where   one   is   required   under the

Immigration Rules.

This would apply whether or not the person was subsequently given

leave to enter on exceptional grounds. But if a person accepted

by the Immigration Officer as qualifying for entry without leave,

for example as a British citizen, had been carried without

documents, no penalty would arise.

3. The Bill   would therefore cover all those who need a visa to

enter   the   United     Kingdom,     namely     foreign     nationals and

Commonwealth Citizens   specified in   the Appendix   to the Rules,

stateless persons, other holders   of non-national   documents, and

certain holders of refugee travel documents.

4. The provisions should apply equally to arrival in the United

Kingdom by ship or aircraft.

5. The obligation to pay penalties should rest with the owner or

agents of the ship or aircraft.


6. The penalty would be a fixed sum of  1,000 per person, but it

would be capable of being varied by order. It would be imposed

by or on behalf of the Secretary of State.

7. It should be specified in the legislation that the penalty

would arise unless the carrier could show that the passenger had

produced to the carrier documents which appeared to comply with

the requirements of the legislation, unless the falsity of those

documents was reasonably apparent.

8. The legislation would provide for extension to the Channel

Islands and the Isle of Man.
