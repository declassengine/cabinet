&lt;~ky/ REVIEW BODY REPORTS

\\ Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet

The Prime Minister has now received all the reports from the Review

Bodies.    They ry^veVrecommended the following increases with effect from

1 April 1987.   (( &lt;J

2.     The Government has said that it wyvl^ccept Review Body

recommendations unless there are clear^rfxf compelling reasons for not

doing so.   The Review Bodies themselves^ay that they have taken account

of general economic circumstances as well as outside pay movements and

problems of recruitment and retention.    Their recommendations compare

with:

-   An average level of settlements for BEfe^5Kble economy

so far (covering a quarter of employee$Oaf)about

5.75 per cent.    In the private sector ft-ir^/

4.75 per cent.

*These figures exclude discretionary increments for Grades x^n^o in the

Civil Service, which will come into payment for certain membe*^*/ those

grades during 1987-88. ^^^^^


  -   An offer to most civil servants which costs about

y\ 5.2 per cent on the 1987-88 pay bill.    But the general

j\ increase on 1 April will be only 4.6 per cent (4.25 per cent

or  5.75 per week, whichever is greater).

^ X/     -   A year on year increase in underlying average earnings

v&apos;yL^(^      f r the    whole economy of 7.5 per cent in February.

^^^^A year on year increase in the Retail Price Index of 4 per cent

/^\^in March.

3. ThqrAia^reases recommended by the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) can

be finand^ra within existing public expenditure provisions.    The Secretary

of State rer Defence is prepared to finance the increases recommended by

the Armed Forces Pay Review Body within the public expenditure provision

approved for the Ministry of Defence for 1987-88, but reserves the right

to bid for incr S1lA in resources to finance the costs of the increases in

subsequent yearlsV.   Vpcroved programmes for the National Health Service

(NHS) include pro\ ys&apos;Tc a for pay increases of 3.75 per cent, but the

increases recommenV^^^ft the Review Bodies for NHS groups would cost an

additional  426 mill^fTj* 1987-88.

PROPOSALS

4. Ministers directly cMroe&apos;rM|ed have considered what the response of the

Government should be to thaNfi^it^w Body reports,  and have reached the

following conclusions and reow e^lations,  for consideration by the

c,biw&apos; .

5. In the light of the financi^J^iwiications of the Review Body

recommendations and the potential e (BKuissive implications of some of the

increases recommended Ministers have&gt;^nsidered various options for

deferring,  staging or abating the imJ^gSSjrtation of the recommended

increases.    In particular,  they have cary^Ld^red whether the effective date

of implementation of the increases shoirVf^be deferred from 1 April 1987

to 1 July 1987;  this would reduce the ado^tional cost of the increases for

NHS groups in 1987-88 to about  250 million.    On balance, however, they

have concluded that the increases recommended by the Armed Forces Pay

Review Body,  the Doctors and Dentists Review Barfy ^od the Nurses Review

Body should be implemented in full from 1 AprijYl9)t^.    This is on the

understanding that, so far as the increases forS^^Twmed Forces are

concerned,  the cost for 1987-88 will be met withifcCejeaAiing public

expenditure provisions for that year.    Ministers noT^/at the Secretary

of State for Defence will wish to bid for increases la/KjiJavprogramme to

finance the cost of these increases in future years. ^Tu^c^ill be a

matter to be considered in the forthcoming Public ExpendiYu4&amp;. Survey, and

there is no commitment to increase the provisions for th  fK?Tv!stry of

Defence in those years to take account of the cost of thesXjx/peases.

6. The Secretary of State for Social Services is discussing\wVt^?Sthe

Chancellor of the Exchequer how far the additional cost of the&lt;^ fcrc^^ses

for NHS groups, not covered by existing provision, can be met frMp&apos;saVings


elsewhere in expenditure on the NHS and how far it should be met from the

Reserve; the outcome of this discussion will be reported to the Cabinet

separately.

^O?.     So far as the TSRB groups are concerned, Ministers have had regard

the offers to civil servants described above.   Though the average

^/fricrease in the pay bill on account of those offers will be 4.6 per cent

^tfi^^l April 1987, with further special increases later in the year which

Nfe^ke^che increase in the pay bill for the year to 5.2 per cent, for the

Cixfl/Sjprvice grades immediately below those covered by the TSRB the

immej^^ta increases will be only 4.25 per cent.   Ministers have therefore

conc^M^i that the increases recommended by the TSRB should be staged for

all thrV^g^ades concerned (judges and senior officers in the Armed Forces

as welfC&lt;as senior civil servants), with 4.25 per cent being paid with

effect from 1 April 1987 and the balance with effect from 1 October 1987,

by which time the further special increases will be in operation.

8. The discff^riynary increment scheme for Grades 2 and 3 in the Civil

Service, recorUieno&amp;i by the TSRB in 1985 and accepted by the Government

last year, wilr^flSeVNinto effect during the course of 1987-88.    It is

proposed to annoVmceVpVetails of this scheme at the same time as the

decisions on the Ra^rfewJiody Reports.

9. Following pract l^^s^sice 1984, pensions will follow salary rates in

payment and not any notion^, salaries.

REVIEW OF PARLIAMENTARY A^LOwWlES

10. The TSRB has submittedN^^ftarate Report on MPs1 and Peers&apos;

secretarial allowances, whicr^ ^?c mends that the MPs&apos; secretarial

allowance should be frozen at i^rc^rrent level for at least a year. That

would require a fresh Resolution-ar^XJ&amp;e House.   Ministers propose that

this report should be published asawm as possible, without any

Government statement of views on troHSS&amp;ort, at least until it has been

possible to assess the reaction of uNy&apos;Hcjjse of Commons to it.

ANNOUNCEMENT &gt;^

11. It is widely assumed, if not actually known, that all the Review Body

Reports have now been received.    Ministers coo^jder that there is a strong

case for announcing the Government&apos;s decision^ quickly, so as to avoid

uncertainty and speculation.    Decisions on ReXrjj&amp;tf^ody Reports have

generally been announced by way of a Written Answer))to an arranged

Parliamentary Question.    Arrangements have been Taara^to put down a Written

Question for Answer tomorrow, Thursday 23 April. ^Tr^fclje Cabinet approve

the proposals described in this Note, the Prime Minta^e^will announce the

decisions in an Answer on the lines of the draft att cne&lt;&amp;&gt;which will

become public at 3.30 pm tomorrow afternoon.

Draft Question

To ask the Prime Minister if she will make a statement on

the latest reports of the pay review bodies.

Draft Answer

The 1987 reports of the Review Bodies on the pay of Nursing

Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to

Medicine, Doctors and Dentists, and the Armed Forces, and of the

Top Salaries Review Body, have been published today. Copies are

now available in the Vote office. The Government is grateful to

members of the Review Bodies for these reports and the time and

care which they have put into their preparation.

2.      The following table shows the increases in pay rates

recommended by the Review Bodies and their cost:

Review Body	Average increase %	Range of increase %	Cost*  m

Nurses, midwives and health visitors	9.5	5.0-12.7	447

Professions allied to medicine	9.1	6.0-12.6	39

Doctors and Dentists	7.7	7.0-8.25	230

Armed Forces	5.96	4.0-7.0	200

Top Salaries	4.8	4.6-5.1	4

?including employers&apos; national insurance and superannuation

contributions where appropriate.


3. The Government has decided that the increases recommended

by the Review Bodies, with the exception of those recommended by

the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), should be implemented in

full with effect from 1 April 1987.    The TSRB recommendations

will be implemented as to 4.25 per cent from 1 April 1987, with

the balance from 1 October 1987, reflecting the offers made to

civil servants in grades just below those covered by the

recommendations.

4. The costs of the awards this year will be generally met

from within existing public expenditure totals.    The Government

recognises, however, that, so far as the National Health Service

groups are concerned, this might adversely affect services to

patients and has therefore decided to provide an extra

        million for Health Authority cash limits from within the

total of planned public expenditure this year.

5. The pay rates and scales resulting from the decisions will

be promulgated as soon as possible for all the groups concerned.

Pensions will be based on the salaries actually in payment in

accordance with the principle set out in my Written Answer of

13 April 1984  (Col 383).

6. I am today announcing separately the Government&apos;s decision

to proceed with the scheme for discretionary pay at Civil

Service Grades 2 and 3, on which there has recently been

extensive consultation, as part of the Government&apos;s policy that

there should be a strenthening of the link between pay and

performance at all levels within the Civil Service.    It is

expected that discretionary pay increases will be in effect as

from 1 October 1987, at the rates recommended by the TSRB.
