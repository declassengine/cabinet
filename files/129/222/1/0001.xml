CABINET

ACCOUNTABILITY OF MINISTERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS

Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal

I attach for the information of members of the Cabinet the draft

Government respona^^o reports on accountability from the Treasury and

Civil Service CoifurfTmee (HC 62) and the Liaison Committee (HC 100).    It is

intended that the^ja&amp;jonse, in the form of a Command Paper, should be

presented to Pariia*flfentt} by the Prime Minister,  the Minister of State,

Privy Council Offic  3&amp;a^myself on Thursday 5 February.

2. The reports from Committees and the response are concerned

mainly with the guideli^s^ta.be issued to civil servants who may be asked

questions by Select CommiLt^^sdirected at their own individual &quot;conduct&quot;.

This arises from our respoff^e tio the Fourth Report from the Defence Select

Committee on West land (Cmnd\S22v3\ in which we announced our intention to

issue such guidelines, to mak^PcAear that &quot;civil servants should not

answer questions which are or^Vp^ar to be directed at the conduct of

themselves or of other named civfY/s^&amp;yants&quot;.

3. Considerable concern was expra^ ed/in the debate on Westland on

29 October 1986 that this new guidanc^/^guld have the effect of inhibiting

Select Committees in their proper tasE^J^inquiring into the expenditure,

administration and policy of Gove rnment^De-j aVt men ts.    In the light of this

both the Treasury and Civil Service Comnfa^tee, and the Liaison Committee,

urgently considered our proposal. V

4. On accountability the Treasury and Civil Service Committee report

provides background argumentation, but makes noys&apos;pbVific recommendations.

The Liaison Committee report, picking up key pa^intij _ rom the Treasury and

Civil Service Committee, recommends that the Govei&apos;mneVt should clarify the

distinction between &quot;actions&quot; and &quot;conduct&quot;, shoul^-^kjfe^sissue the proposed

guidelines, and should undertake that a Minister wiy^^&amp;lways be

accountable to the appropriate Select Committee. C/\&gt;^

5. The intention has been to keep the reply as short aS/rfOT-sible,

stressing the common ground between the Government and tn^ e3raiittees, in

order to end this exchange.   At the same time there is no^s*wp-ftion of

giving way on the key points of the accountability of Minist&gt;*ra?^jid the

need for guidelines for civil servants.    These are attached bAjurjS reply

and will be formally issued to civil servants at about the enaCoi//2&gt;

February.    This fulfils the commitment I gave in the debate on \yS\


29 October 1986 Co give the Liaison Committee an opportunity to consider

^the guidelines before they are issued, although I understand that the

^^.iaison Committee is unlikely to wish to comment on or endorse the

_Auidelines.

v6^0/ J&apos;he Treasury and Civil Service Committee report also covers several

va&amp;4f\jt&amp; aspects of the relationship between Ministers and civil servants,

foVrowsJig their earlier report (HC 92) and the Government reply to that

(Cmftd/^8^1).    In this reply it is proposed simply to note these further

7.     The and guidelines have already been the subject of

consultaoio&apos;jrwith colleagues principally concerned with the management of

the Civil^ervice and with events that gave rise to the earlier reports.

I invite colleagues to note the draft response and the proposed guidelines

to civil servants.

FINAL DRAFT

ACCOUNTABILITY OF MINISTERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS

Government Response to the Fir3t Report from the

Treasury and Civil Service Committee (Session 1986/7, HC62)

and to the First Report from the Liaison Committee

(Session 1986/7, HC 100)

The Issue of Accountability

The Government recognises and welcomes the common ground which exists between

it and the Committees on the basic principles underlying accountability, and

which the Treasury and Civil Service Committee record in their Report. With these

basic principles agreed, the Government is confident that understandings can

be established which will enable the work of Select Committees to be carried

on in a way which conforms with those principles and meets the needs both of

Parliament and of Government.

2.     The Treasury and Civil Service Committee consider as &quot;too narrow&quot; the Government&apos;s

statement that &quot;Select committees exercise their formal powers ... by virtue

of the accountability of Ministers to Parliament.&quot; The Committee note that &quot;Select

Committees exercise their formal powers ... because Parliament is sovereign and

has established Select Committees to monitor Government Departments ...&quot;. The

Government agrees with this statement of one aspect of the constitutional basis

on which Parliament oversees the actions of the executive. But the Government

also believes that it is of fundamental importance to recognise another aspect

of the constitutional relationships involved: that the oversight that is exercised


CONFIDENTIAL

is of policies and actions of Departments for which Ministers are formally and

ultimately responsible and accountable to Parliament. This does not mean that

only Ministers may give evidence to Select Committees; this has certainly not

been the case hitherto and the Government has no wish to make it so. It does

mean that, as a general rule*, when civil servants give evidence to Select Committees

on the actions of their Departments in carrying out the policies of Ministers,

they do so on behalf of, and subject to their duty and accountability to, their

Ministers.

3-     The Liaison Committee recommend &quot;that the Government give an undertaking

that in future it will always ensure that a Minister will be accountable to the

appropriate Select Committee&quot;. And both Committees invite the Government to

reconsider its response to the recommendation made by the Procedure Committee

in their First Report of 1977-78, namely &quot;that in future Select Committees should

be empowered by the House to order the attendance of Ministers&quot; (HC 588, paragraph

7.21). This recommendation was not accepted by the Government when the present

Select Committee system was set up in 1979; the reasons were set out by the then

Leader of the House in the debate on the proposed Select Committee system on

25 June 1979 (House of Commons, Official Report, cols. 44-46), the main one being

the constitutional inappropriateness of a departmental Select Committee being

empowered without the specific authority of the House as a whole, to order the

attendance of a Minister (or indeed any Member of the House of Commons). The

then Leader of the House went on to give the House and Select Committees a pledge

of the Government&apos;s determination to do all in its power to &quot;co-operate with

the new system of Committees and to make it a success. I believe that declaration

 Special considerations apply to civil servants designated and giving evidence

as Accounting Officers, and to those exercising powers vested in their offices

by statute.


CONFIDENTIAL

of intent to be a better guarantee than formal provisions laid down by Standing

Orders&quot;. A formal undertaking was also given by the then Leader of the House

cn 16 January 1981 that he would seek to provide time for the House to express

its view &quot;where there is evidence of widespread general concern in the House

regarding an alleged Ministerial refusal to divulge information to a Select

Committee&quot; (House of Commons, Official Report,  16 January 1981, col 1312).

4. The Government, having considered the matter further as requested, remains

of the view that this is the appropriate way for matters of this kind to be handled

and reaffirms the pledges and undertakings given   in these respects in 1979 and

1981. While it may often - indeed generally - be convenient that departmental

evidence to Select Committees should be given by civil servants, it is the Minister

in charge of the Department concerned who is accountable. That being so, the

Government accepts that it would be consistent with the earlier pledges and under-

takings that, if civil servants giving evidence to a Select Committee were unable

to answer a question to the Committee&apos;s satisfaction because they were inhibited

by their duty to or the instructions of Ministers, the relevant Departmental

Minister should be prepared himself to attend the Committee.

5. The Government agrees with both Committees that it is helpful to define

&quot;actions&quot; and &quot;conduct&quot; of civil servants separately, and accepts the recommen-

dation of the Liaison Committee that the position be clarified without delay.

An unambiguous distinction is clearly vital to the guidelines that the Government

proposes to issue to civil servants on answering questions relating to conduct.

The Government believes that the most important distinction to be drawn in this

context is between questions which seek to establish the facts of what has occurred

(&quot;actions&quot;) and those which explicitly or implicitly seek to assign criticism

or blame to individual civil servants (&quot;conduct&quot;).

-3-


CONFIDENTIAL

6. In discussing the definition of &quot;actions&quot; of a civil servant, the Treasury

and Civil Service Committee note that they are &quot;in no doubt that it would be

quite wrong and entirely unacceptable for any restrictions to be placed&quot; on the

giving of evidence about &quot;actions&quot; and invite the Government to make clear that

it has no intention of doing any such thing. On the understanding that the Committee

are not calling in question the existing conventions which limit the provision

of information on such grounds as national security, confidentiality, and the

preservation of collective responsibility, the Government is happy to confirm

that it has no such intention.     As the Leader of the House said in his speech

in the House on 29 October, referring to the Government&apos;s response to the Fourth

Report of the Defence Committee (Cmnd.  9916),:  &quot;It has been represented as a

way of making any future   Select Committee inquiry ineffective. It does not,

and is not intended to, do anything of the sort&quot;. He went on to say: &quot;As now,

if something has gone amiss, a Select Committee will be free to seek an account

from the Minister concerned or from a senior official representing the Minister.

This could cover what has gone amiss, why it went amiss, what has been done to

correct and remedy what has gone wrong and to prevent a recurrence. In short,

we do not seek to prevent Select Committees from pursuing their enquiries into

the expenditure, administration and policies of Departments.&quot; (House of Commons,

Official Report, 29 October 1986, Col. 415).

7. The Treasury and Civil Service Committee&apos;s report quotes at some length

from the speech made in the course of a debate on the Crichel Down affair by

the then Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. The Government is of the view

that the four instances set out by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe in that speech provide

a comprehensive framework within which to consider the accountability of Ministers

for the activities of civil servants, and wishes to point in particular to the

concluding sentence of Sir David Maxwell Fyfe&apos;s explanation of his fourth category:

&quot;But, of course, he [the Minister] remains constitutionally responsible to Parliament

-4-


CONFIDENT I \_&apos;.

for the fact that something has =gone wrong, and he  il:r.e can tell Parliament

what has occurred and render an account of his stewardship&quot;.  (House of Commons,

Official Report, 20 July 1954, Cols. 1286-7).

8.     The Government welcomes the fact that the Liaison Committee agree with its

view that Select Committees should not act as disciplinary tribunals. The Govern-

ment for its part agrees that Select Committees should not be prevented from

seeking to establish facts. If in the course of an inquiry a Select Committee

were to discover evidence that called in question the &quot;conduct&quot; of a particular

civil servant, the right course would be for the Select Committee to pursue the

matter with the Minister concerned, rather than pursue their own investigation

into the &quot;conduct&quot; of the civil servant. It would then be for the Minister to

arrange for the matter to be looked into and for the Committee to be informed

of the result in due course. Such a procedure would, in the Government&apos;s view,

be consistent with the needs of Select Committees as expressed in paragraph 14

of the Liaison Committee&apos;s Report.

9-     The Government has considered carefully the arguments put forward in the

Reports from both Committees that guidelines to civil servants, on answering

questions which are or appear to be related to &quot;conduct&quot;, should not be issued.

The Government understands the concern which has been expressed but remains of

the view that civil servants appearing before Select Committees need to have

guidelines within which to work when they are giving evidence. The Government

has therefore prepared supplementary guidelines which take account of the views

expressed by the Treasury and Civil Service Committee and the Liaison Committee.

These supplementary guidelines are appended herewith. The Government believes

that these clarify the distinction between &quot;actions&quot; and &quot;conduct&quot;, that they

are consistent with the principle of Ministerial accountability to Parliament,

and that their operation will allow Select Committees to continue to discharge

effectively their proper role of inquiring into the expenditure, administration

and policies of Departments. 5


CONFIDENTIAL

10. The Liaison Committee expressed specific concern about the ability of certain

non-departmental Select Committees to function effectively if guidelines were

instituted. Their report refers to the Government&apos;s acknowledgement (in the debate

on 29 October 1986, House of Commons, Official Report, Col.  415) of the special

position of the Public Accounts Committee. The Government accepts also that several

other Committees have requirements with   respect to civil servants which differ

from those of departmental Select Committees and confirms that nothing in these

guidelines is intended to affect the way in which the Committees mentioned in

the Liaison Committee&apos;s Report have taken evidence from civil servants hitherto.

Duties and Responsibilities

11. The Government notes the Treasury and Civil Service Committee&apos;s further

views on these matters. As regards the provision of a right of appeal for members

of the Diplomatic Service and of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (similar

to that which the Government has agreed in principle should be provided for members

of the Home Civil Service) it was not the Government&apos;s intention in its reply

to the Committee&apos;s previous Report to imply that similar provision should not

be made. Appropriate arrangements for such appeals to the Heads of the respective

Services will be considered in the light of arrangements made in respect of the

Home Civil Service. Beyond this, the Government has nothing to add to the views

it expressed on these subjects in its reply (Cmnd. 9941) to the Committee&apos;s earlier

report (HC 92).


CONFIDENTIAL

FINAL DRAFT

Guidelines for Officials giving Evidence to Departmental

Select Committees*

Officials who give evidence to departmental Select Committees do so

on behalf of their Ministers in accordance with the principles that civil

servants are accountable to Ministers, and that it is Ministers who are

accountable to Parliament. In giving evidence, civil servants are therefore

subject to the instructions of Ministers and remain bound to observe their

duty of confidentiality to Ministers.

2.     In the course of Select Committee inquiries into the expenditure, admini-

stration and policies of Departments and their associated bodies, the evidence

given by officials will normally be concerned with explaining the policies

and actions undertaken by Ministers, and by Departments on their behalf,

and the reasons for those policies and actions. Sometimes, however, a Select

Committee&apos;s inquiries may involve questions relating to what has been done

by individual civil servants. On such occasions, the principles of Ministerial

accountability are still applicable, even if officials have acted outside

or contrary to the authority given to them by Ministers.

3-     Subject to the general principles set out above, official witnesses

should in all Select Committee inquiries be as helpful as possible in

answering questions concerned with the establishment of the facts of what

has occurred in the making of decisions, or the carrying out of actions

in the implementation of Government policies.

 These guidelines supplement, and should be read in conjunction with, the

memorandum of guidance for officials appearing before Select Committees,

and will be incorporated in future editions of that guidance.

____ 1


CONFIDENTIAL

4. There may however be occasions when questions put by members of a Select

Committee in the course of an inquiry appear to be directed to the &quot;conduct&quot;

of individual civil servants. &quot;Questions directed to the conduct&quot; in this

context means more than the establishing of facts about what has occurred;

it carries the implication of allocating individual criticism or blame.

In such circumstances, in accordance with the principles of Ministerial

responsibility, it is for the Minister to look into the matter and if

necessary institute a formal enquiry. Such an inquiry into the conduct and

behaviour of individual civil servants and consideration of disciplinary

action is properly carried out within a Department according to established

procedures designed and agreed for the purpose, and with appropriate safe-

guards for the individual. It is then for the Minister to be responsible

for informing the Committee of what has happened and of what has been done

to put the matter right and to prevent a recurrence. Evidence to a Select

Committee on this should be given not by the individual civil servant or

servants concerned, but by the Minister or by a senior official specifically

designated by the Minister to give such evidence on his behalf. This would

include the result of any disciplinary or other departmental proceedings

against individual civil servants.

5. So if in the course of an inquiry a Select Committee were to discover

evidence that called in question the &apos;conduct&apos; of an individual named civil

servant, the understanding is that the Select Committee should not pursue

their own investigation into the &apos;conduct&apos; of the person concerned or act

as a disciplinary tribunal, but should pursue the matter with the Minister,

for whom it would then be to deal with it on the lines described above.

6. If, when officials are asked to give evidence to a Select Committee,

it is foreseen that the inquiry may involve questions about the &quot;conduct&apos;*

of the individual officials in question or about other individual named

__ -2-


CONFIDENTIAL

officials,  it should be suggested to the Committee that it would be appro-

priate for a Minister or a senior official designated by the Minister to

give evidence, rather than the named officials in question. Any question

which appears to relate to the &apos;conduct&apos; of individual civil servants, such

as the allocation of blame for what has occurred, can then be answered by

the Minister or designated senior official. If an official giving evidence

to a Committee is unexpectedly asked questions which he or she believes

are directed at his or her individual &apos;conduct&apos;, or at the &apos;conduct&apos; of

another named individual civil servant, or if the official is uncertain

whether or not questions fall into this category, the official should

indicate that he or she wishes to seek instructions from his or her Minister,

and the Committee should be asked to allow time for the Minister&apos;s instruc-

tions to be sought.
