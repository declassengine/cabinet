OPENING THE JAPANESE MARKET

MfflMrandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

Following Cabinet on 26 March,  I am reporting on three aspects of trade

policy towards .I^pSh.:

a. how t&lt;r&gt;9^^ greater access for our financial institutions;

b. how to oDta^jW^ifair deal for Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W);

c. and, more gertetktty, how to achieve faster progress in opening

the Japanese market

2. On the first two issustX^^e/have considerable freedom to decide our

own line of action.    We have~^rftorsue the last issue through the Economic

Community  (EC) because under \^aevx featy of Rome trade policy is a matter

of Community competence.    We ara^me to have regard to our General

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GPr$r&quot;JV*jb ligations.

FINANCIAL SERVICES &lt;^&gt;

3. A large number of Japanese securiMws jipalers and banks have

established themselves in London, helpiVg^fo build up London as a major

international financial centre.    On the o^her hand, United Kingdom firms

who have applied for permission to set up in Tokyo have met with

obstacles.    Our response has been to demand reciprocity.    In order to

strengthen our leverage we took powers in the Fi^rgj^cial Services Act

enabling the Government to override decisions tr/tna United Kingdom

regulatory authorities if reciprocal access to xl2X^!gJk markets was denied

to United Kingdom financial service firms  (see An/fex Xj).    As the powers

were specifically taken for these financial marketS^rjraVng purposes they

can only be used in that context. ^///^\

4. I have told the Chancellor of the Exchequer that jrpTcop^se to make

forthwith the Commencement Orders to bring into effect th^^^N.s powers in

relation to the banking and insurance sectors.    The insuralnrceA^owers are

for me to exercise;  the banking powers are for the ChancelrfcH^y&amp;his will

be a strong signal to the Japanese but does not commit us ye ^?^ Revoking

the authorisations given to any Japanese banks or insurance cowp^&amp;jtes

operating in the United Kingdom. /^\\.


5.      Once the new system of authorisation of investment businesses under

Athe Financial Services Act is in place,  I can then bring into effect the

&apos;jYeciprocity powers for those activities.    That should be at the end of

-O^tvis year.

X$ySf/ Our strategy has produced some results  (see Annex A).    But we are now

&lt;jre^i g Japanese resistance to better access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Tl^e^M^ister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is visiting Tokyo next week

and^i&quot;lrw&gt;ress the Japanese for a firm timetable for the enlargement of

the m aj&amp; rship of the Exchange with unrestricted access for United Kingdom

firms.^^^no satisfactory timetable is forthcoming we shall have to

decide oyhM^g most effective way to use our new powers.

CABLE ANDVIRELESS

7. The Japanese assure us that no decision has been taken but there is

very heavy pres s&lt; r^vf orm the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to

allow C&amp;W only k(devosory share in the winning consortium (see Annex B).

C&amp;W are asking fcr^21TVSer cent but realistically they may have to settle

for something lessyA.^M/wre pressing the Japanese Government to permit

adequate foreign par^otoation,  as allowed in Japanese law and should

continue to do so bacfye*M6\ threats of unspecified retaliatory action. I

am calling in the JapaT^^Ti^jibassador and will take this line with him. I

shall also ask him why thex^^as been no reply to the Prime Minister&apos;s

letter to Mr Nakasone.

8. United States support is&gt;^d[Nk important in resisting Japanese

pressure to reduce foreign shN^enp^dings to an insignificant level.

However,  it is quite possible zfyff/United States interests could be met by

bringing in other United States Q $rfpjro&apos;ies such as American Telephone and

Telegraph in a way that would stilL^e&apos;sirict C&amp;W to an unsatisfactory

level.

9. It is possible that the Japanese nrefy^a^k C&amp;W to sell them a similar

shareholding in their United Kingdom sui gj*aiary Mercury.    The Government&apos;s

agreement would be required if the Japane^ acquired more than 15 per cent

of the shares.

10. If we judge that the eventual outcome is unacceptable we should have

to respond.    The EC are most unlikely to agreef/rady sanctions over a

bilateral United Kingdom-Japan dispute in the s^^^e^v field, and as noted

above the Financial Servies Act powers cannot be \^ed/in this context.

The available options are limited.    It is often sugg^ fiyxl that we should

take administrative action to delay or inconvenience^vrpp p&lt;s, eg Customs

procedures and discrimination in applying safety and oOreO^egulations.

The objection to such devices is that they would be subjec^/fro legal

challenge in our Courts, and expose us to the risk of danrJtk^aKd

investigation by the Parliamentary Commission.    Some otherM^jDj/j/ans are:

a.      Telecommunications:    I could announce that I intenoAtV^ake

reciprocity considerations  into account in deciding whetn&amp;r^^D^rant

telecommunications licences to foreign companies, and in thaVyv

telecommunications apparatus approvals procedure.    But the rorjn^*^


^ would have no immediate impact since there are no proposals from

*\ Japanese companies, and none seem to be in prospect.    The latter

)\ could be challenged in the Courts.

V, b.      Intellectual Property:    Discriminate against Japanese patent

&apos;V/w applications; but this would be contrary to the Paris Convention and

^yr^^datents valid in the United Kingdom could be obtained from the

C^E* opean Patent Office.

&lt;g^^Air Services: Move Japanese Airlines from Heathrow; retaliation

 %q!&amp;J,t British Airways and British Caledonian Airways would be

d. Ntark Permits: Make it more difficult for the Japanese to obtain

permits; this would have a severly discouraging effect upong Japanese

inward investment from which the United Kingdom economy benefits

sub s t an t i a

e. Share PTybc&apos;n*^aes :    Deny the Japanese the opportunity to buy

shares in priV^&amp;*^^/Tion and in the British Petroleum pic sale but we

would need to h^al&amp;^c that the flotations would not thereby be

harmed. /

So that we are able to re^r^li quickly,  should the need arise,  I propose

that the pros and cons orVrffesw and any other options should be studied by

officials, bearing in mindN^^^r^ed for the measures to fit the

circumstances of the C&amp;W casary^?^

MARKET OPENING &lt;(^&gt;$\

11. United Kingdom/EC strategy haa^fe^.to:

- press for monetary and macf^f^CTfrmomic measures, eg a stronger

yen and expanded domestic deirMrfd f^

- seek to remove barriers, by acc^on in the GATT eg on alcoholic

drinks;

promote exports, by offering except io/fjSx^eve Is of support to

British exporters to Japan. (f V

12. These polices have been reflected in success\Yg^   munity

declarations - most recently at the March Foreign Af3Ri^/a. Council. This

called for the implementation of the Maekawa Report onr/$ rtictual economic

reform and for market opening against a quantified impvp^Cb^rget. The

Council agreed to consider further action at its July meepkjS.

13. Despite lack of market opening it has been dif f icult NSo_^Wp suade the

other EC countries to take decisive action.    We have been for&gt;&lt; ^aVto adopt

a lead role throughout.    The growing United States resentmenc^a^i^st

Japan, reflecting their trade deficit and dissatisfaction over^w^tfprking


^    of the United States-Japan agreement on semi-conductors, may be helpful in

stimulating the EC to take a more robust line.    Even so it will

s^jbe an uphill task to get EC agreement on new and tougher measures.

^\

O^&amp;VX The options (see Annex C) for further action,  in increasing order of

^d^yiculty, are as follows:

V^a^X   Tougher measures against the dumping of components,  on which

^^he^Commission has recently tabled a proposal.

bC^^Onbinding the EC&apos;s tariffs against a range of Japanese

eleqfatpnic consumer goods to balance the industrial benefits which

Jap^nOierives from Spain and Portugal&apos;s accession to the EC.

c. If the United States acts against Japanese exports eg as it

threatened oy_er semi-conductors,  for the EC to follow suit to avoid

trade diveyvfcJvK.

d. Press tne/7[&amp;\to relaunch its general GATT Article 23 acting

against Jap anW dA*\ which we would effectively accuse Japan of

&quot;nullifying&quot; th^r/^fckts 0f GATT partners.    If successful, Japan would

be required to ofmjj^^emedies under threat of retaliation.

There is reasonable prospea^eJ: getting EC agreement on a.  to c. The

chances of achieving d. raMpte poor without substantial non-EC and

especially United States su^p^w?\

15. There is one further opty^trvOto press the EC to agree that Japan&apos;s

persistent refusal to take effevCXfaeOaction to integrate its economy into

the multilateral trading system &lt;^a*fimD\longer be tolerated; that Japanese

breach of GATT Article 23 is self-a^raep ; and that discriminatory trade

action against Japan,  including penal^tmport duties on a selected range of

goods, should therefore be taken.    TT^TSSfcfy act of raising this option in

the EC would send a shock-wave throughV^eXfcapanese administration, but

such a course could bring down the GATT would meet strong opposition

from within the EC,  led by the Germans. N^nd if rejected it would

undermine our credibility both within the Community and in the eyes of the

Japanese.

16. United States resentment against Japan shcwld &lt;jnake it easier to get

EC agreement to taking stronger measures.    The tre^^TJvtep could be for the

Foreign Secretary to sound out other EC views at Hie^pAxopean Political

Co-operation meeting this weekend.    Subject to the (jKwame, we should then

ask for detailed Community consideration.    We want tothe other EC

countries hard and take up the recent French offer of^Sj^fr^ral talks.

Thereafter we could use the Venice Summit in June to promcrj&gt;^ a declaration

critical of Japan.    Japan could also be high on the agend^XefK^the

European Council meeting later that month. Nv/Za


^&gt; CONCLUSIONS

^^^L7.    I invite colleagues&apos; agreement to the following courses of action:

\\Va.      Financial Services:    The reciprocity powers of the Financial

&apos;/ Services Act should be brought into effect as soon as possible: the

^y/^M^iister for Consumer and Corporate Affairs when in Tokyo should

bt&amp;ss hard for a firm timetable for access of United Kingdom firms to

V^h^Stock Exchange.

le and Wireless:    Maintain pressure for fair treatment:

offig^a^ls should examine the full range of options for retaliation.

c.      Market Opening:    Press the EC to act quickly on items a.to c. in

paragraph 14: use the European Political Co-operation meeting to

press EC counties to agree to a GATT Article 23 challenge and test

reactions ytJ^tYbe further option in paragraph 15; seek United States

co-operatiJxjj-Nt^   general GATT challenge; use other opportunities

such as the Vjemiga Summit to maintain pressure on Japan.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

The Financial Services Act contains a reciprocity provision, which

enables the Secretary of State to refuse or revoke the authorisation

to do banking,  insurance or investment business, of financial

services companies from countries which do not offer reciprocal

access for UK firms in their financial markets.    The Banking Bill

was amended in February, to extend these powers to takeovers of UK

banks by foreign institutions: the Bank of England will be empowered

to block voting rights or require divestment.    It is proposed to

bring the Financial Services Act powers into force for banking and

insurance now and for investment business later this year when

investment businesses are authorised by either the Securities and

Investments Board or recognised self regulating organisations

(assuming that the SIB becomes the designated agency).

The Minister for Consumer and Corporate Affairs is to visit Japan

from 5-8 April for discussions on access to the Japanese financial

markets.    His principal target will be access for British firms to

the Tokyo Stock Exchange  (TSE).    Six foreign firms have seats on the

TSE, following a 10 seat enlargement in September 85, out of a total

membership of 93.    Three are US owned, one is wholly British owned

(Warburgs) and two are UK-connected: Vickers da Costa (US owned) and

Jardine Fleming (half Hong Kong owned).    Two British firms,

Schroders and Kleinwort Benson would like seats at once and others

will want them in due course.    Four Japanese firms are members of

the London Stock Exchange, but following the Exchange&apos;s merger with

ISRO, 40 others are qualified to become members of the new

International Stock Exchange in London.

A new Japanese law, brought into force last November, provides for

the registration of investment advisers, who may apply for licensing

as discretionary investment managers.    Registration has been

straightforward; we are waiting to see if problems arise with

licensing: the first licences are due to be issued in May.    UK firms

have particular expertise in this area.

Since October 1984, we have secured 12 Securities Branch Licences

(SBLs).    UK-owned or UK-connected houses now hold 14 out of around

30 foreign SBLs  (compared with 2 out of 9 then).    We have been

broadly satisfied with recent progress in this area, but 6 British

firms including Barclays and Lloyds are still seeking SBLs now and

during the next 12-18 months.    Japanese and other foreign firms have

been freely authorised by DTI to &quot;deal in securities in Great

Britain&quot;.    There are now some 58 authorised subsidiaries of Japanese

houses in London.

As regards banks there are in London 29 Japanese banks.    In addition

there are 15 Japanese representative offices.    Their business has

grown remarkably.    In Tokyo all 5 UK clearers have commercial

banking offices but they have found business difficult.

CABLE &amp; WIRELESS

Japanese law allows 33 1/3% foreign participation in any

company operating telecommunications services. Two

consortia ITJ and IDC, have been formed to offer

international services in competition to KDD, the existing

Japanese monopoly.    ITJ is entirely Japanese.    IDC includes

foreign members; C&amp;W (20%), Pacific Telesis  (US)  10%, and

Merrill Lynch (SU)  3%).    The proposals they have put forward

are different.    ITJ, at least initially, would rely on KDD

facilities.    IDC propose the use of a new privately financed

Trans-Pacific cable.    The Ministry of Posts and

Telecommunications (MPT) has made it clear that significant

foreign participation is unwelcome, and it would not welcome

separate applications from IDC and ITJ.    It has, therefore,

encouraged the two groups to merge, and at present only

wants to allow C&amp;W a 3% share.    Many Japanese companies are

in both consortia, and most are content to merge.    C&amp;W are

fighting the merger proposal, with some Japanese support.

MITI and Foreign Ministry are sympathethic to UK and US

demands that foreign participation should be allowed to the

extent permitted by Japanese law.

The outcome on this issue, and what Cable and Wireless will

accept, are far from clear.    Similarly we cannot be certain

that C&amp;W will continue to receive support from their

Japanese partners or from the American interests who are

involved in this consortium.

OPTIONS FOR FURTHER ACTION IN THE TRADE FIELD

(i) Dumping of Components - The Commission want to extend

EC anti-dumping rules to allow action not only against

imports of completed products but also against such products

assembled in the Community from imported parts.    We have

expressed strongly sympathy with the Commission&apos;s objective

but want to achieve it in a way that does not discourage

inward investment in the UK.

(ii) Unbinding EC Tariffs - Spain and Portugal are

considerably reducing their import duties on manufactures as

part of the process of accession to the Community. Japan

will benefit from this.    The Commission recommend that

consistent with GATT the EC should unbind (ie free from

increase but not raise)  its tariff on various consumer

electronic goods.    We have supported unbinding since it

clears the way for rapid action to raise tariffs (or threats

to do so) in the future.      Precise proposals to raise tariffs

would require careful study:  in some cases UK has no industry

to protect but considerable interest in low prices for

consumers.

(iii) US Retaliation - The US has threatened to impose

prohibitive tariffs on $300 million worth of imports from

Japan in retaliation both for Japan&apos;s failure to implement

the US/Japan agreement on semiconductors and to balance the

lack of market access in Japan.    If denied access to US

markets a proportion of the goods affected would probably be

diverted to the Community.    The EC could therefore arguably

match the US action in order to avoid such diversion,

claiming under GATT Article XIX that this threatened &quot;serious

injury&quot; to EC industries.

(iv) General Article XXIII Action - In 1982 the EC opened a

GATT case against Japan&apos;s entire trade regime.    They argued

that the clear imbalance of trade benefits between Japan and

the EC constituted, effectively,  &quot;nullification of their GATT

rights&quot;.    The EC suspended the case in 1984 because Japan

offered a programme of market opening measures and because

the Commission doubted the likelihood of further success.

The Community could now relaunch the case, but the prospects

of a clear victory remain unpromising.
