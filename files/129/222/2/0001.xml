ECONOMIC STRATEGY

H^morandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

We are now rea^t^^ benefits of prudent monetary and fiscal policies.

The economy is pe^^L ing as well as  that of any developed nation. Growth

has been sustained# ^r to 3 per cent a year since 1981,  one of our

longest periods of l^n^on ever.    It  is  in marked contrast to the record

of the 1970s. ?^JL

2. Yet the most remarkable feature of this expansion is that it has been

achieved against a background of falling inflation and with improving

competitiveness.    Inflation has fallen from 16i per cent at the end of

1980 to 33/a per cent at the end^^ 1986.    Manufacturing productivity has

grown faster than  in any of  UI4nBr competitors.    Provided we guard

against a resurgence of inflati^JI^^ provided we maintain external and

domestic confidence  in our pol ic i^P^we prospects  for this year and next

are good. ^^^0^

3. But  the proviso is  important.    ^Bfi^p^ demonstrated convincingly that

steady growth comes  from pursuing a sol^R^^fcnetary and prudent fiscal

policy set in a clear medium-term franevvvkand from resisting the

temptation to inject  fiscal stimuli which^Rkflk provide short-term gains

but spell long-term trouble.    The overriding n^kd in this Budget must be

to do nothing which might put  the favourable^^ro^ects which now lie

before us at risk.

FISCAL PROSPECT

4. Last year&apos;s Budget was dominated by the sudden c^^fcpse of our oil

revenues,  which have fallen from Zlli billion  in 1983^^^^^ an estimated

 4i billion in  1986-87.    1  introduced a cautious Budge^JdM^i nevertheless

contained sufficient by way of tax reduction to show our^OTt^gnination to

stick with our policies.    The Public Sector Borrowing RequjtfSmnt (PSBR)

was expected to be around  7 billion in 1986-87.    This sti^^sjgtaed the

most  likely outcome at the time of the Autumn Statement. SiaKlen,

however,   the  tax gathering season has revealed a marked surge ^P^RL-0^

revenues.    This  is not the result of stronger economic growth &quot;&quot;^Pb^^

economy has performed in line with our projections.    It  is  the c^Je nce

of higher than expected effective tax rates:    as Table  1 of Annex 3m|^s,


non-North Sea tax as a proportion of non-North Sea Gross Domestic Product

^(GDP) is estimated to have risen from 37.1 per cent of GDP in 1985-86 to

^^7.4 per cent of GDP in 1986-87, contrary to our long-term policy of

 raducing the burden of taxation.    As a result,   the PSBR this year will,

^B^the second year  in succession,  be  lower than  the Budget estimate.

T.^^Kiis outturn inevitably affects the appropriate stance for 1987-88.

pftRence is judged,  in part,  in relation to achievement.    The economy is

performing well both absolutely and relative to other countries, with a

lower than expected PSBR.    There is thus a strong case for setting next

year&apos;s PSBR at a lower figure than the per cent of GDP envisaged in

the Medium T^rm Financial Strategy (MTFS). The last thing we should do is

to take arAw ecessary risks  - or even to appear to be doing so.

6. Despite^PK^ I still expect  there  to be scope for further tax

reductions  th^^^Kr,  although the substantial public expenditure

increases we an unBed in the autumn have pre-empted the greater part of

our fiscal scope^^^fl^i 11, however,  be seen as a measure of the soundness

of our policies  tB^^pLshall be able to maintain public borrowing at a

prudently low level^^^ye both the sizeable additions we have made to

public expenditure an^^OTkcollapse of our oil revenues,  and still find

room for some further ?edJ^on in taxation.

ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

7. During 1986 our economic performance has been influenced by the

difficulties the world economy experienced in adjusting to the sharp fall

in oil prices.    We have seen a swm growth of demand in all the

industrial economies,   including o^MjAited Kingdom.    But the oil producers

and other developing economies cut^BH^their imports more than expected.

As a result the  industrialised couiv^Jgfcexperienced weak export demand in

the early months of 1986.    United KinKowexports  initially reflected this

performance but have grown strongly s Iwregfl^ middle of the year.    By the

fourth quarter of 1986 the volume of vis^ ^expor ts  (excluding oil and

erratics) was 9i per cent higher than a V^^^P^rlier.    This appears to

have been a stronger performance than in a^^^OTer major economy.    As a

result, manufacturing output grew rapidly in^thJ^cond half of 1986,

following pronounced weakness in the first ha!^^

8. The growth of the United Kingdom&apos;s main overseas markets should be

somewhat stronger in 1987 than in 1986. There are, however, risks that

the outturn could be less favourable. Any prolonged turmoil in foreign

exchange markets could lead to reactions that dampen d^i^M and output in

the major economies. It is also possible that develop^J^^untries and

oil producers could import less from the developed econoq^^^khan we now

expect.    Nor can we be sure that protection will be heldlk^j^

9. On the reasonable assumption,  however,  that demand for ^^^^^Kingdom

exports  in 1987 grows more quickly than  in 1986,   the prospec t

continued strong export growth.    But because non-oil  imports ha^^^fm!

growing rapidly and the surplus on oil  trade has declined by  5  ^^k^Jl&gt;

there is  likely to be a modest current account deficit of around ^pejj^

cent of GDP in 1987.


10.    Domestic demand is expected to continue to expand steadily in 1987,

I    and this,  combined with vigorous export growth,  should mean yet auother

0^year of 3 per cent growth for the economy as a whole.    The composition of

LAiomestic demand growth is likely to be more balanced than last year, with

r^^mghtly slower growth of consumers&apos;  expenditure and much stronger

^P^ jLs tment.

ljr^he continuing steady growth performance has contributed to a welcome

fall in unemployment.    Since August 1986 unemployment  (United Kingdom

seasonally adjusted, excluding school leavers) has fallen by 107,000.

With 3 per cent growth in prospect,  there is every chance of unemployment

continuing to fall at a roughly similar rate throughout 1987.    But the

prospects ^^^d be even better if we could see a further slowdown in the

rate of pJ^^proteases.

12.    Since trM^^^&gt;f the 1985-86 pause we have seen a further surge in

product ivity, pj^^^mtlarly in manufacturing industry.    This builds on the

good product ivi^^pj^formance achieved by British industry throughout the

1980s, when by co^KBon with other developed economies,  United Kingdom

productivity growth^K||JDeen considerably better than  in the 1960s and the

1970s.    Indeed,   in t^^^^^f output per head in manufacturing industry, we

have done better sinca^ii9^than any other member of the Summit Seven, as

the following table sho^^^%

13.    For 1986 as a whole,  inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index

(RPI) averaged 3.4 per cent - the lowest annual figure siflke 1967. Since

the 1983 Election most of the short-term swings  in theAm^ily RPI have

mirrored changes  in the mortgage interest rate.    For exal^L^^the monthly

lows of 3.7 per cent  in  1983 and 2.4 per cent  in  1986 coi^Pfc^fc with

falling mortgage rates, while the monthly high of 7 per ce^^^L985

reflected a rising mortgage rate.    With no further change infcorW^ge

rates,  the RPI is likely to edge gradually upwards from the laBi^^k

published figure of 3.7 per cent during the first half of this ^M^^ef ore

falling back to around 4 per cent by the fourth quarter.    This pla^^^Lis

largely the result of the mortgage rate increase at the end of la^k^eA,

coupled with the effect on the  12-month comparison of the temporary*d^ffcp

petrol prices  last summer.


14. The recent and prospective performance on inflation is in historical

Aterns a good one, and one that we can point to with some satisfaction,

^kut most other major industrial countries have still lower levels of

1a t i o n,  and  it remains  important that we continue to give  the highest

^BP^rity to keeping  inflation on an unambiguously downward underlying

sutTmary and conclusions

15. Output growth last year was close to its average rate since 1981 of 3

per cent a year; and a further 3 per cent growth is expected this year.

This compar^^ell with other major countries.    Unemployment  seems set to

fall  in 19 m^Inflation  is rising a bit  - though from the somewhat

ar t i f ic iaLr^B^^rates recorded in the middle of last year.    Markets will

be paying c l^E^K ten t i on to this and perhaps also to the prospects for

the current acv^^^of the balance of payments.     It  is  in both our short-

term and raedium erl^nCerests  to play safe,  with relatively modest tax

reductions and a^ftj&apos;j^^below the level envisaged in the MTFS.

ANNEX 2:  DIRECT EFFECTS OF TAX CHANGES

A. Direct Taxes; Indexation

The RPI increased in the year to December 1986 by 3.7 per

cent. With indexation by this amount and statutory rounding, the

figures for the main allowances and other thresholds would be:

Personal allowances 1986-87 1987-88

Single and wife&apos;s earned income allowance 2,335 2,425

Married allowance 3,655 3,795

Bands, eg:

29% rate 0-17,200 0-17,800

60% rate over 41,200   over 42,900

The total revenue costs of indexation of income tax (included in the

forecast) are  800 million in 1987-88 and  1,080 million in 1988-89.

B. Indirect Taxes; Indexation

The effects of 3.7 per cent revalorisation of the excise duties

(including VAT effects) are as follows:

VAT inclusive price change		Yield in 1987-88  m	RPI impact  m

Beer	0.8p/pint	60	0.04

Wine	2.9p/70cl light wine	20	0.02

ANNEX 3: THE TAX BURDEN

Since the Government came to power total taxes and NICs as a

proportion of GDP at market prices have risen by about 4 percentage

points, though the ratio has fallen from its peak in 1981-82. The

decline in 1986-87 reflects North Sea revenues (down from 3.2% to

1.3% of GDP).

Personal Sector

2. Despite reductions in income tax, total personal taxes (direct

and indirect, including employees&apos; NICs and domestic rates) in

1986-87 are about  20 billion higher in real terms (ie 1986-87

prices) than they were in 1978-79. For income tax and national

insurance contributions the following table shows how the proportion

of gross pay they represent rose up to 1981-82, particularly for the

low paid:

1986-87	(estimate)	18.9	28.4	30.9

1987-88	(indexation)	19.4	28.7	31.1

?Adult male earnings (all occupations). Married couple,

wife not working: the couple are assumed to have no

children, to avoid distortion of the figures from the

abolition of child tax allowances.

3. These figures reflect the rise in the standard employees&apos; NIC

rate from 6i% to 9%. The lower rates introduced in the 1985 Finance

Act do not affect the cases shown. So far as income tax is

concerned, personal allowances have increased by about 22% in real

terms since 1978-79, slightly faster than earnings. The basic rate

has been reduced from 33p to 29p, but the 25p reduced rate band has

been abolished.

4. As the table shows, indexation of allowances in the Budget

would lead to a slight rise in the proportion of incomes taken in

tax and NICs. This is because earnings are assumed to rise by 6i%

compared with the indexation percentage of 3.7%.

5. Following the sharp rise in corporation tax receipts this

year, total taxes paid by businesses (outside the North Sea) are now

slightly higher as a percentage of GDP than in 1978-79. Within this

total, the major change has been a fall in employers&apos; NICs and NIS

as a percentage of GDP, offset by increases in corporation tax,

business rates and &apos;other&apos; taxes as the following table shows:
