(secret)Draft White PaperNEW PRIORITIES IN PUBLIC SPENDINGINTRODUCTION1.     In a statement in the House of Commons on 27 October theChancellor of the Exchequer announced new policies for the public sector and their implications for public expenditure.   The principlesunderlying these policies were explained in that statement.2.    This White Paper summarises the effects of the new policies onthe public expenditure programmes.     Where these policies affectfamilies1 outgoings, this White Paper also outlines the exemptions,remissions or offsetting benefits which will be available;   manyof them will be increased.     In order to ensure that the publicare aware of the exemptions and benefits concerned the Governmentwill give them new publicity.3.    The following tables show the public expenditure programmes for1971-72 and, in outline, for 1974-75 as they would have been onthe policies existing before the Government&apos;s review and as theyhave now been announced by the Chancellor.    The totals of the newprogrammes are lower than the previous costings by about  300million in 1971-72 and by nearly  1,600 million in 1974-75.Between the two years the average annual rate of increase in total public expenditure, which at constant prices would have been 3.6 percent on the previous costings, becomes 1.8 per cent;   excludinginvestment grants from the comparison, these rates are,respectively, 3.6 per cent and 2.7 per cent.THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE programmes

general notes on tables, 1.......and 2(1)   The figures in column (a) are the costings made in thelatest annual Survey of public expenditure and long termcostings of defence policy which are prepared each spring.They include the estimates then made of the cost of the policies set in the White Paper &quot;Public Expenditure,1968-69 to 1973-74&quot; (Cmnd.4234)p and such changes of policy as were made after the White Paper but before the survey.(2)   The figures in columns (b) and (c) include subsequentchanges in estimates in addition to the changes causedby new policies as set out in the following paragraphs ofthis White Paper.(3)   The established convention for expressing projectionsof the social security programme is that the figures show the cash cost of the benefits at their existing levels.The additional real cost of any improvements of benefitsthat may be decided upon in the future represents a charge on the unallocated margin in the total plan.(secret)
secretlju    111 the figures of expenditure in the following paragraphsare at 1970 Survey prices,.Defence Budget5.    The Long Term Costings for 1971-72 have been reduced by 28 million, to  2,327 million, the equivalent in real terms of thelevel forecast in the December 1969 White Paper (Cmnd 4234) S &quot;^the costings for 1974-75 have been reduced by  132 million net to atotal of  2,300 million.     Thus the Government will contain thelevel of defence spending, while meeting the additional expenditure to be incurred on the UK military contribution to Five-Power defence arrangements in South East Asia, the expansion of the Territorial and army Volunteer Reserve, and the other new policy measures set out inthe Supplementary Statement on Defence which will be presented toParliament by the Secretary of State for Defence.Overseas aid,    The economic aid programme, which for 1971-72 will be  245million in gross cash terms will be maintained at the rapidly rising(1)levels forecast in Cmnd.4234   &apos; and there will be a further increase to  32+0 million.   On this basis the total provision at constant prices and net of repayments of loan will rise from  213 million 0in 1971-72 to  256 million in 1974-75.Research Councils7.    Public expenditure on the Research Councils will be cut by amounts rising from  2 million in 1971-72 to  5 million in   1974-75The resulting programme will rise from  115 million in 1971-72 to 129 million in 1974-75.     The whole of this expenditure isbeing reviewed.(1)   &quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1973-74&quot;.5
Technology ft Industry and pommegce80    The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation will be wound up.As a result a sum estimated at  20-30 million under theCorporation9s existing statutory limit will remain undrawn;   anda liability will be avoided to find up to an estimated  40million extra a year which would otherwise have been incurred in the years ahead.9*    The Regional Employment Premium, which is running at a littleover  100 million a year, will be discontinued in September 1974.10*    Expenditure on other programmes in the field of technology,industry and employment will be reduced by ^Ig7 million in1971-72 rising to  65 million in 1974-75.     In some cases,decreases remain to be worked out in greater detail.    Thegrant to the British Productivity Council will be phased out andthat to the Consumer Council discontinued.     The scheme of grants and loans to hotels will end with the expiry   of its lifeunder existing legislation.11.    There will be some  131 million additional expenditure over the period on Government Training Centres and various othertraining measures, and on staff required to implement industrial relations legislation^12.    ^Development AreasjJ?Nationalised Industries13.    This programme provides only for the capital expenditure ofthe nationalised industries.    The costing of existing policiesincluded provision for the acquisition of ports and port businesses0These items are eliminated under the new policies.    New estimates
of the industries&apos; expenditure has reduced the totals by  25 mil11in 1971-72 and  50 million in 1974-75 for additional shortfallnow expected.     Ths programmes themselves have also beenreduced by  1+3 million in 1971-72 rising to  73 million in197h-75.Roads and Transport11..    These programmes have been reduced as follows:  million1971-72 1974-75Roads                                                  5 25Assistance to nationalised industries                                    10 15Other transport                                8 1823 58The resulting programmes will rise from  1,02k million in total in 1971-72 to  1,182 million in 197h-75.Local Environmental Services..... , ^15*     This programme will be marginally reduced under new policiesby  10 million in 1971-72 and 197k-75, for instance, by restricting the use of public finance for industrial and commercial develop-ment outside development areas.Arts16.     It has been decided that charges should be levied for admission to national museums and galleries.     The arrangementsfor these charges will be discussed with the institutionsconcerned.     These charges are expected to yield about  1 million in a full year^-
:cretEducationprimary Schools17*    There will he a substantial increase in school building programmes to enable local education authorities to make fasterprogress in replacing and improving sub-standard primary schools,particularly those built before 1903.   In the country as a whole the school building programmes already authorised for 1972-73amount to  i84 million of which some  171 million is needed toprovide additional places and only  13 million is available forthe rebuilding of existing schools.     This &apos; improvement * programme will now be increased by extra starts of  21.5 million in 1972-73(of which  2 million will be for Scotland) leading to extra expenditure of about  28 million over the four years to 1974-75.There will also be a transfer of resources from other educationbuilding programmes which will add a further  8-9 million startsto school building.School Meals18.     The charge for school meals is at present Is 9d which willbecome 9 new pence after decimalisation and will be raised to12 new pence on 1 April 1971 and to 14 new pence on 1 April 1973.The aim is that the charge should eventually cover the runningcost, which is at present 2s lOd (nearly 14p) in England andWales and a little more in Scotland.     Prom 1 April 1971* thegrosB level of parents  income below which their children areentitled to free meals will be raised for an average family by 1 10s a week in April 1971 rising to about  2 a week in April1973.    The estimated net savings from the increased charges,after allowing for the extended entitlement to free meals, is11 20 million in 1971-72*THa-iTiff tn f!^8 million by 1974-75.
School Milk19.    A Bill will be introduced to discontinue the supply of freemilk to pupils at the end of the summer term after they reachage 7.    Younger pupils in nursery and primary schools, olderpupils who have a medical requirement and pupils in special schools will not be affected.    The implications of these changes willbe discussed with local education authorities.     In a full year the saving will be about S3 million.Further Education Fees20.    Discussions will also be held with local educationauthorities in England and Wales on increases, from September1971* in the fees charged in further education establishmentsfor non-vocational courses and for vocational courses for those already in employment;   but it is not intended that there shouldbe any tuition charge for students under 18 attending full-timecourses.    The aim will be to save  5 million in a full year.Open University21.    Discussions are being held with the Open Universityauthorities on the future size of the University, on theprospect of increasing its revenue, and on the contribution itcould make towards the higher education of students under SI.Health and Welfare services22.    The forward expenditure plans will be adjusted to providefor new expenditure amounting to  110 million over the years1971-72 to 1974-75.    With this provision the Government aims tofurther the development of the health and welfare services,including the improvement of hospital facilities, particularly
for the elderly and mentally handicapped,Welfare Milk23.    Cheap welfare milk, which is now subsidised by the taxpayer to the extent of 6d a pint, will cease to be provided.But the existing arrangements will continue whereby;,  welfare milk is available free of charge for expectant and nursing mothersand children under the age of 5 in families which are in need,and for the third and subsequent such persons in all families.In addition the gross income level for entitlement to freewelfare   milk will be raised for an average family by about 2 a week.    This is expected to cost  1 million a year taking account of the greater use which is expected to be made of thisbenefit as the result of new Government publicity;   and the netsaving to the health and welfare programme from these changesis estimated at  31 million in 1971-72 and  32 million in1974-75* compared with previous expenditure forecasts.Prescription charges2k*    A Bill will be introduced, after consultation with thoseIconcerned, to enable these charges to be related more closelythan now to a proportion of the cost of the individualprescription.    Meanwhile, the existing flat rate charge of 2s 6dper prescription item will be raised to 4s, the arrangement forexemptions remaining unchanged.    The present arrangements forremission of prescription charges, in case of need, will be adjusted to take account of the increases in the charge.    Therewill also be increased charges for elastic hosiery and new charges for certain appliances supplied by hospitals.    These immediatechanges are estimated to save  15-17 million in a full year.
25. The subsequent change to charges related to a proportionof costs is intended to reduce the annual cost to the taxpayerby a further  15 million.General Dental Services26.    Charges for dental services will be related to approximatelyhalf of the cost of the services actually provided, apart fromdental examinations which will continue to be free of charge.This will mean increases in charges, of varying amounts, for thoserequiring expensive treatment, but reduced charges for thoserequiring little treatment.    This change is expected to save  10-11 million in a full year.27.    Legislation will be introduced in due course to reducethe upper age limit of exemption from dental charges for young people from 21 to 18.     This would save a further  1 million a year.28. The gross income level for entitlement to remission of dental charges will be raised for an average family by about 2 a week.     This is expected to cost about  1 million a year.General Ophthalmic Service29.    The charges for ophthalmic services, which at present cover the full cost to the National Health Service of frames andlenses, will be extended to cover the cost of dispensing also.This will save about  5-6 million in a full year.30.    Eye tests will continue to be free;   and exemption fromcharges will also continue for children under the age of 16and those over 16 but still at school full time.
31.    The groaa income level for entitlement to remission ofophthalmic charges will be raised for an average family byabout  2 a week.     This is expected to C03t about  -  million a year, j32.    Subject to Parliamentary approval, all the foregoingchanges concerning health and welfare services will be broughtinto effect as soon as the necessary statutory and administra-tive arrangements can be completed.SjOQial SecurityUnemployment, sickness and injury benefit33*    Under the present rules flat rate unemployment, sickness and injury benefit is paid for the first three days of absence from work if the claimant is unemployed or sick for a period of twelve days or more.    Legislation will be introduced to endthis entitlement.     Supplementary benefit is available forcases of hardship.    There will be a saving of about  20 million        -a year.Family benefit3k*    A Bill will be introduced to provide a new cash benefit for poor families with breadwinners in full time work.    payment would start in August 1971.Miscellaneous Services35.    The abolition of the   Land Commission reduces expenditureon the acquisition of land.    The reduction in 1971-72 is 21 million.    But since betterment levy has also been abolishedthere will be some loss of revenue.
\  IEE  i^l. ie t ^Northern Ireland36.    Some of the new policies which are being introduced forGreat Britain will also affect Northern Ireland.     Consultationsare in progress on this.ilAgricultural Subsidies, Housing Subsidies, and General Measures(i) Agriculture;   price guarantees37.    The new system of agricultural support, based on levyarrangements, will reduce the agricultural support bill in due course, but it is too soon to be precise about the amount of the savings for 1971-72.     In the longer run substantial savingsare expected, perhaps of the order of  150 million by 1974-75.Increases in food prices will be taken into account in the periodical upratings of social security benefits, includingSupplementary Benefits.     The new legislation on family benefit(paragraph 34 above) is also intended to help in this respect.(ii) Housing Subsidies38.    The present system of housing subsidies is to berefashioned.     The Governments intention is to move progressivelytowards a basis of fair rents for both public and private sectortenancies.    ^Councijl7 tenants who need it will be given help with their rente through a standard scheme of rent rebates/and housing allowance^.      By the middle of the decade thisis expected to lead to a saving in public expenditure of ^ 100-2007million a year by comparison with the projection on the basis ofthe existing system..(secret)
(secret)39.    Details of the new policies in these two fields have still to be fully worked out.     Consultations are also involved with overseas governments in the one case and local authoritiesin the other.     For these reasons the revised provision forthese two programmes in both 1971-72 and 1974-75 is shown groupedtogether, with an unallocated margin in the total expenditureplan which provides a contingency reserve,i(iii)   General measures40.    An intensive examination of the functions of centralGovernment and of their manpower requirements is in progress.The Government expect local authorities also to seek to improve their efficiency.     The scope of charges in the public services generally, and their alignment with costs where this isreductions in due course in the provision for particularprogrammes, but it is too soon to say by how much in each case.At this stage they represent an offset to calls on the contingency reserve.Unallocated provision - contingency reserve41.    For the purpose of column (a) of Tables 1 and 2 (the1970 Survey and Defence Costings) the same figures for the contingency reserve have been assumed for 1971-72 and 1974-75respectively as were given for the corresponding years (1970-71(2)and 1973-74) in the White Paper of a year ago.v 1 in the revised estimates the amount unallocated and available for new policy(2)   &quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1973-74&quot;   (Cmnd.4234).appropriate, are being examined.These measures will justify(secret)
commitments or new costings willp as explained in paragraph 39above, depend in part on the extent and timing of t he savings on the agriculture and housing subsidies already mentioned.Relative price effect and other adjustments42.    This includes the relative price effect and the adjust-ments to 1970-71 outturn prices;   and a price adjustment for social security benefits.^   For both 1971-72 and 1974-75 anunallocated reduction of  100 million gross is embodied in thefigures, in the light of past experience, for likely shortfall in individual expenditure programmes other than capitalexpenditure of the nationalised industries (see paragraph 13above).(3)   For an explanation of this adjustment see Cmnd 4234*Appendix III, paragraph 9*11
