DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BPvITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 93 COPY NO26 October 1970CABINETEUROPEAN SPACE CONFERENCE: POST-APOLLO programme memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. The Committee on Science and Technology (SCT) considered at their meeting on 21 October the line to be taken by our Delegation at the ministerial European Space Conference (ESC) to be held in Brussels on -5 November 1970.,2.        We have now reached a cx*ucial point in our policy tov/ards Spaceespecially in the European context.    At the resumed Brussels Conferencewe shall be called on to declare our position on further studies of thepost-Apollo programme of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA), which could eventually lead to participation byEuropean countries in the space programme of the United States,    TheUnited States Government has offered a qualified guarantee to providelaunch facilities, at cost, for satellites and other applications, to ESCcountries in return for a &quot;substantial&quot; contribution by the ESC to thedevelopment of a space transportation system (the space &quot;shuttle&quot; and &quot;tug&quot;).3.        Both the costs and the benefits of participating in the post-apollo programme are as yet ill-defined.    We have been told that the cost to theUnited Kingdom could amount to about  100 million over 10 years,, reaching a peak of aboLit  15 million In 1974-75, exclusive of any use we make of thesystem for our own purposes.    This figure is almost certainly anunderestimate.    The benefits are even more difficult to quantify.    However,refusal to participate would be very badly received by most of the othermembers of the ESC, and would adversely affect our negotiations on theCommon Market and our relations with the United States.4.        The American offer has been studied by officials, and their reportto SCT is annexed.    Paragraph 9 of the report sets out three options forour Delegation at the Ministerial ESC on 4 November, the first of whichwas not recommended by officials.    The Committee endorsed this view.However, the Committee were unable to reach agreement on the tworemaining options.1
5.        The majority of the Committee advocated that the United kingdom should agree to take part in negotiations on the post-Apollo programme inthe expectation that we would subscribe fully to a joint programme,provided that a really satisfactory basis for European partnership was arrived at.    There was, however, some difference of view about theextent to which we should commit ourselves at this stage.    Somecolleagues felt that it would be damaging to make reservations at the outsetabout our willingness to carry through from studies to development; butothers felt that we should reserve our final decision on the grounds thatthere was insufficient knowledge available at present on the cost of theprogramme and the conditions of participation.    The latter course wouldcertainly be strongly criticised by some members of the ESC, and inparticular the French, who might well if we took this position decide not toparticipate further in the proposed European Space organisation.    this could be the end of any effective joint European effort in Space or at theleast the end of effective British association with such a joint effort.6.        The Chief Secretary took the opposite view and advocated that theUnited Kingdom line should be to reaffirm our previous decision not toparticipate in any launcher development.   He pointed out that noDepartment has come forward to take the post-Apollo project on theirVote (apart from the minor cost of preliminary studies) and that even withoutthe other major aerospace programmes now under consideration we already have claims approaching the provisions of the General contingency reserve.7.        The Committee were unanimous that the instructions to our delegation must be unambiguous so that there can be no misunderstandingby other countries about where we stand.   At the same time colleagues will recognise that if we agree to participate in further studies of thepost-Apollo programme we must also contemplate making provision for eventual expenditure of the order shown in paragraph 3.8.        In the light of the discussion in SCT I consider that we have twooptions open to ussA.        To declare our willingness to go forward with furtherstudies of the post-Apollo programme on the understanding thatthe United Kingdom would participate in the development of the space transportation system if these studies reveal economicreturns and technological benefits adequate both in relation to thevolume of investment involved and to the alternatives available forthe acquisition of launchers by the United Kingdom.    Meanwhile,we should continue to decline participation in a purely Europeanlauncher development.2j
B.        To maintain exist:ng commitments to the Europeanapplications and scientific satellites programme, while reaffirmingthe previous United Kingdom position on launches?  Le, to acquirethem from the United States on a case-by-case basis, and to decline to participate further in the post-Apollo negotiations.9.        I invite my colleagues to decide between options A and B above,and to instruct our Delegation to the Ministerial European SpaceConference to be guided accordingly.Civil Service Department SW126 October 19701i11
EUROPEAN SPACE CONFERENCE:    POST-APOLLO PROGRAMMENote by the Chairman of the Communications-Electronicsand Space Committee1.     The attached submission by the Ministry of Technology sets out anddiscusses proposals which have been made to the European SpaceConference (ESC) by the United States for substantial participation bythe ESC in developing a new system of space transportation, in exchange for guarantees by the United States that launch facilities stemming fromthat programme, and those which already exist, will be made available toESC member countries for any peaceful purpose consistent with relevantinternational agreements.     This note summarises the issue on whichofficials have agreed to seek Ministerial guidance, in preparation for theESC Ministerial discussion of the proposals, which will take place on -5 November.    The Under-Secretary &apos; of State for Political Affairs of theUnited States has defined &quot;substantial&quot; to mean a contribution by the ESCof not less than one-tenth of the development cost of the two components(the shuttle and the tug) of the system.    Although the direct issue isthat of the post-Apollo programme, it is important to recognise its close connection with that of the EUROPA III project.     The Americans have linkeda blanket assurance on availability of launchers with European participation in the post-Apollo programme.    The Europeans also insist that they arelinked on the grounds that Europe cannot afford both an independentcapability and participation in post-Apollo.!&apos;:&apos;.-&quot; :.1(confidential)imSfrMiflMi limhiMMiiM 11111.111111-111111.;:-;&quot;^- 
2.     The United Kingdom has at present no commitment to engage, alone orin collaboration with other ESC countries, in the post-Apollo programme.The British delegation to the July meeting of the ESC did however undertaketo participate -i.     in studies of a limited character (set out in paragraph 4 of thememorandum);ii.     in an ESC Mission led by the Belgian Minister M Lefevre to explore -a. the conditions of such participation;b. the conditions under which the United States would offerguarantees of launch facilities.3.     The ESC in November is likely to seek British concurrence in continuednegotiations with the United States on issues a. and b.     In addition, theESC will probably wish to embark on a further series of preliminary studies of possible European contributions to the post-Apollo programme.     if conditions for European participation can be negotiated which appearsatisfactory to the majority, or to several of the main members of theESC, the United Kingdom will be faced with a further request to contribute to the costs of such participation.    The costs of preliminary studies maynot be excessive, but the costs of the &quot;substantial participation&quot; whichthe United States invite could be high.    We have been informed that thecost to the United Kingdom could amount to about  100 million over 10 years,reaching a peak of about  15 million in 1974-75.     This may be an under-estimate and does not, in any case, include the production and operating costs of the system.    There would he no point in helping to develop thesystem if we did not use it substantially.4, No financial provision has so far been made in any Department&apos;expenditure programme, beyond that for the limited studies mentionedabove, for such participation in the post-Apollo programme. At thepresent time, and in the climate of the current Public Expenditure Review,2(confidential
(confidential)no Department is prepared to seek approval for the inclusion of thenecessary sums in its programme for the years in question.     The chief secretary to the Treasury has made it clear that space activities, whethernational or international, should not be exempt from the discipline of thePublic Expenditure Review.5.     In these circumstances, the Communications-Electronics and SpaceCommittee (CSC) consider it essential to bring this matter immediately to the attention of Ministers.6.     The Ministry of Technology&apos;s submission draws attention to the uncertainties surrounding the post-Apollo programme, which has not yet received Congressional approval for the fiscal year 1971.     Particularuncertainty surrounds the uses to which the new space transportationsystem will be put, and the British Defence Research and DevelopmentStaff in Y/ashington have advised that the United States defence interestin the programme will prove extremely important.7.     The 3SC as a whole are unlikely to reach an early or unanimous viewabout participation in the programme, if only because several of thesmaller members would have difficulty in finding the money.     Germany and france, however, are showing great interest, and it is believed that theFederal German Government have already made budgetary provisions for their share of a possible 10 per cent participation.     The French have saidrecently (7 October 1970) they will not increase their contribution to european co-operation in the space field, and that their membership of theproposed new unified European space organisation   will depend upon member states, or all the major ones, contributing to a &quot;complete, coherent andbalanced space programme&quot;.    That means, according to the French officialdelegates, that the United Kingdom must agree to finance the launcherprojects agreed at the July ESC as parts of the optional programme.    Theword &quot;launcher&quot; is used by the French in this sense to apply either to a future version, EUROFA III, of the ELDO Rocket, or to European participation in the post-Apollo programme, or to an integrated combination of the two.Other ESC countries have said they are prepared to recommend further study3(confidential)
(confidential)of the post-Apollo programme only if all those taking part in the studiesdo so with the intention of participating in any programme, assuming that satisfactory arrangements can be agreed with the Americans.8.     The Ministry of Technology^ submission argues that, in the present state of knowledge of United States intentions and of the technical,commercial and industrial implications of the post-Apollo programme, a definitive commitment to participate cannot be incurred either by theUnited Kingdom or by the ESC for the time being.     Nevertheless, themajority of the Committee recommend that a clear decision in principle should be made now;   and that if the decision is in favour of participation - given suitable conditions - that Ministers approve theline of action set out in paragraph 26 of the Ministry of Technologysubmission.    The possible benefits of taking part are described inparagraph 25 i. of that paper.9.     In the light of these considerations, officials believe that thereare 3 feasible options for the line to be taken by the United kingdom delegation at the Ministerial ESC on k November -Option 1.     To agree to whatever proposals command a majoritysupport among the ESC countries, including participation inarrangements to procure guaranteed launch facilities withoutrestrictions, whether by building EUROPA III, by participation in the post-Apollo programme of the NASA, or by an integratedcombination of the two.Option 2.     To agree to go forward with negotiations on the post-Apollo programme in the knowledge that Ministers could contemplatemaking provision for eventual expenditure of the order proposed,provided a satisfactory basis for European participation in a viableprogramme were arrived at;   and accordingly to resist sharingEuropean launcher expenditure meanwhile.(confidential)
(confidential)Option 3.     To maintain existing commitments to the Europeanapplications and scientific satellites programme, while re-affirmingthe previous United Kingdom position on launches, ie to acquire them from the United States on a case-by-case basis, and to decline toparticipate further in the post-Apollo negotiations.10.   Option 1 has the advantage of appearing pro-European and pro-American,thereby avoiding confrontation between British and e.c. views.     On theother hand, it involves large additional expenditure not provided for in existing PESC submissions.    Officials recommend that Ministers do notadopt it.11.   Option 2 would be the immediately easier of the two remaining optionspolitically, and in the light of the present uncertainties Ministers maywell feel it to be the only sensible course of action.    However, such acourse would not resolve all the present problems about the Frenchposition, particularly that of the EUROPA III programme;   it would alsorepresent the thin end of what might prove a very fat wedge of futurepublic expenditure for which no provision has been made in the recentPublic Expenditure Review.     Furthermore, if the Government subsequentlydecided not to participate in the post-Apollo programme they would almost certainly find it impossible to withdraw without incurring severe criticism from both Europeans and Americans.12.   Option 3, while requiring a certain political determination, couldrepresent a constructive and economically sensible line to take with theother Europeans (both EFTA and e.c.) in the light of the Governments knownpolicies in space affairs, and its present attitude to public expenditure and Government involvement in industry.    It would require no additional public expenditure not contained in existing PESC provisions.    Butpolitically it would probably lead to a confrontation with the Frenchand/or the Germans.    While the Germans might be persuaded to support usagainst the French on a choice between EUROPA III or post-Apollo, theycould not be relied upon to support the case-by-case approach.    indeed they are likely to go ahead with the post-Apollo programme on their ownif we opted out.     If we failed to gain a majority for our point of view5
(confidential)we could not expect the other members of the ESC to welcome british participation in any European programme of space technology while notpaying our share of launcher development costs.    We should thereforeexpect to he excluded from European study and development programmes of space applications current or in view, and our eventual use of such applications may be more costly than if we had participated in their development.    We might also expect our attitude to be viewedunfavourably by those sections of American and European opinion who regardspace activity as a desirable international venture.     Such an opinion is widespread in the countries of the Common Market, and our decision, ifannounced, could affect our negotiations for entry to the Common Market.Nevertheless, the CSC advise unanimously against concealing a decision notto participate, such a course would be extremely difficult to maintain inthe ESC discussions, and would expose us to severe and damaging inter-national criticism if our true position were subsequently revealed.13.   If Ministers choose option 2 they may also wish -i.    to authorise the United Kingdom delegation to the MinisterialEuropean Space Conference to acquiese in proposals for further exploration of the post-Apollo programme;ii.    to invite the Minister of Aviation Supply to sponsor on hisdepartmental vote participation in studies of the post-apollo programme, and to arrange for new expenditure on internationalspace programmes, not already allowed for in the current public expenditure Review, to be a claim on the General Contingency Reserve.li14.   If Ministers adopt option 3, officials recommend that Her Majesty&apos;sG-overnment take an early opportunity to communicate their decision to theother Governments concerned, and of following that communication quickly witha public announcement explaining the United Kingdom position.15.   Ministers are invited to choose between options 2 and 3 in paragraph 9.Signed    A H COTTRELL6(confidential)   _
AppendixEUROPEAN SPACE CONFERENCE(Note by the Ministry of Technology)1      The next session of. the European Space Conference (E3C) is dueto be held on 4-5 November.    This will be a continuation of the 4-thmeeting held in Brussels on 22-24 July.    The brief for that meeting(3CT(70)2) was considered by Ministers on 20 July (3Cl(70)lstmeeting).THE JULY SESSION OF TIE ESC conference      In line With the brief approved by Ministers, the United kingdom delegation accepted certain new commitments in respect of appli-cations satellite programmes.    These were the study.of a communi-cations satellite (UK share  0.45M to mid-1971), of an aeronauticalsatellite (UK share  0.43M to end of 1971) and for other studies and experimental work (UK share  0.23M to end of 1371).   The UnitedKingdom also agreed that decisions to proceed to the next stages ofthese programmes and to make the necessary funds available would betaken by a double -qualified majority of the participating countrieswhich include the UK.   The possible cost of these programmes couldbe  2.2M in 1971/72 rising to  6.6M in 1974/75.    In addition, the uk Delegation expressed its continued support for the scientific research programme but accepted no new commitments, in respect oflaunchers.3     In view of the limited support given to some parts of theprogramme and consequential reservations and abstentions by member states all countries not in.a position to state that they willparticipate in certain parts of the programme were invited to make an effort to arrive at a favourable decision by the date of thenext session.4     The Conference considered the implications of the invitation from NAS.u to participate in the Post-Apollo programme and agreed toundertake further studies of possible collaboration with NASA (UK/share ...j
- 2 -share  0.2M to mid-1971) in addition to a study of a space tugbeing conducted by ELDO.    The President of the ESG, Mr Lefevre ofBelgium (together with representatives of France and the UnitedKingdom) were invited to explore on behalf of the ESC, with theGovernment of the United States of America, the political, financialand other conditions for possible European participation in thePost-Apollo programme.    It was subsequently agreed that in theseexplorations Mr Lefevre should be accompanied by Lord Bessborough,Minister of State (Aviation), Ministry of Technology and Mr J-FDenisse President of the French National Centre for Space Studies(ONES)     Despite pressure from the UK and other countries the French*were not represented at Ministerial level.hie LEFEVRE MISSION5      In the course of discussion with the US representatives theMission made it clear that if Europe were to participate in thePost-Apollo programme, the programme for the development of theEUROPA III launcher, which our partners in ELDOare starting, would have to be abandoned.   Before such a decision could he taken by Europe, assurances on the availability of USlaunchers on a commercial basis for any peaceful purposes were essential.    The US authorities were prepared to give an undertaking that launchings would be available to European organisations ormember countries of European organisations for any peaceful purposeconsistent with relevant international agreements.    Such a blanketundertaking would depend on Europe making a substantial contribution(they had in mind a commitment of at least 10)j)   to thecost of the space transportation system (Space Shuttle and Tug but excluding Space Station).    The only exception which they made wasin respect of a provision which is likely to be incorporated inthe proposed INTELSAT Definitive Arrangements whereby the Assemblyof Parties to INTELSAT (representatives of Governments votingOtt a Taaaii of one country one vote) might by a 2/3rds majorityrecommend that a proposal for a separate system for internationalpublic telecommunications services be deemed likely to cause&quot;significant economic harm&quot; to INTELSAT.    In such a case the US,while not automatically refusing a launching, wished to reserve their decision.
CONFIDENTIAL- 3 -6     On this subject and in respect of -participation in theamagement of the programme and the mailing available ofinformation arising from it the Americans undertook to confirmtheir attitude in writing.   This confirmation has now beenreceived.m proposed ijoylisber session oe the esc conferees7     Mr Lefevre will consult his UK and French colleagues whenthe US letter is received and report^t to the next session ofthe ESC on 4-13 November.    The European countries will then have to decide:-i   whether the US response is sufficiently-satisfactory for negotiations to be continued;ii   if they decide to continue the negotiations,whether they should continue at the same time\with existing programmes and studies anddevelopment work on launchers which would be useful both for EUROPA III and the Post-apollo programme pending a final agreement with theus authorities,iii   if the US response is regarded as unsatisfactoryhow far to go in approving a EUROPA III programme8      It is difficult to make, a clear cut decision in thepresent state of the Post-Apollo programme which is not yetdefined or approved by Congress.   a shuttle system has manypotential uses including a possible requirement by the UnitedStates Air Force with whom NASA has an agreement dated 17February 1970 to ensure that the proposed system &quot;will be ofaaximum utility to both NASA and Department of Defence&quot;.j - a ...
CONFIDENTIAL- 4 -A committee has been set up to keep the programme under review in.this context but the United States   Under    Secretary of State for political Affairs has stated that if there is European participationthen Europe must be a partner in reaching decisions which have ameasurable impact on European costs or tasks.    Thare might possibly be some conflict of interest in technical requirements and it wouldbe important to ensure that these were resolved without extra costto the European participants.9     There will be strong arguments in favour of continuing the studies and development &quot;work on the lines of 7(ii) above on thegrounds that to stop now would seriously reduce Europe&apos;s bargaining position with NASA over detailed arrangements.   The UK will be strongly pressed to take up a share in the cost of this workpending a decision because we stand to benefit from this insurancepolicy for which others will be paying.10 No Agenda has yet been received for the next Ministerial meetingof the ESC.    It is not expected that the decisions taken in Julyin respect of applications and scientific satellites &quot;will be directly under review.    The issue will turn on the launcher policy to beadopted by Europe in the light of the offer by NASA of participation in the Post-Apollo programme and the results of the Eefevre Mission.Given the importance attached by Prance and Germany to guaranteedlauncher availability for satellite application programmes and fora balanced space programme for Europe/the ...j
- 5 -the future of coordinated European Space activity turns on finding a satisfactory solution to the question of launchers for Europe.11    If all member states were able to regard the American assurancesas satisfactory the ELDO launcher programme could be abandoned oncearrangements for participation in the Post-Apollo programme were agreed and the programme finally approved.    There will however bedoubts in some countries&apos; minds about the adequacy of the Americanoffer.iMle the United Kingdom is unlikely to wish to establish a system which would not get the approval of the INTELSAT assembly, the Frenchand possibly the Germans, may feel that the European regional tele-communications satellite system which they aim to establish with theirSymphonie project would not muster sufficient support in theINTELSAT assembly - greater than 33 l/3rd$      - to block a contrary1 Vote by the Assembly.   In such a case, in the absence of anI European launcher, they would be dependent on the US being preparedI to launch their -satellite in the face of the INTELSAT vote.   although I the US seem to have accepted the inevitability of European and evenJapanese regional telecommunications satellite systems, they wouldprobably not support a system which takesi iin a large part of Africa on the grounds that this goes beyond a regional system and would cause significant economic harm to INTELSAT.They would therefore be unlikely to launch the Franco-GermanSymphoniesatellite.    If the rest of Europe accepted the US assurances and was prepared to participate in the Post-Apollo programme France couldnot afford to develop and build EUROPA launchers alone.    They mightiiseek to reinsure and obtain a Russian launching if no otherpossibility remained to them.12    The background and implications of the US offer of participation in the Post-Apollo programme are set out in theAppendix 3 to the annex to SCT(70)2.   The political implications for the UK on the,European civil space programme and the NASA offer of cooperationare to bo four.d in Appendix 1 to the Annex to SCT(70)2.A3 ....
- 6 -13   Given the fact that no actual decision to carry out the Post-Apollo programme has yet been taken by the United States and thatcompetitive studies to define the technical features, cost and time-scale of the proposal are not due for completion until Hay 1971, a clear cut decision cannot be made either by the UK or Europe forthe time being.   All that can be done for the present is to consider what the British response would be if:i       the Post-Apollo programme went forward;ii       there were to be a concerted European response to theUS invitation to participate in it,   and       conditions acceptable to the majority of ESC members could be negotiated;, for such participation.CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE UK RESPONSE14  The response must necessarily be considered in the context ofthe current review of public expenditure.    If, in that context the uk share of a European contribution to the Post-Apollo programme as at present conceived is more than we can afford then there isa case for making this clear to our partners.    It is likely to be embarrassing if we continue to play an active part in consideringthe possibility of coordinated European participation in the pro-gramme if we expect to have to say at the end of the day that we arenot prepared to give the necessary priority to the provision of funds for our share of the Costs.   However this might leave us once more inthe position of odd-man-out in Europe and open to the suggestion thatwe should contribute     to the EUROPA III programme.15   The British response must reflect our own space objectives and consideration of these objectives in the context of European spaceobjectives.    The European space objectives were set out inparagraphs 19 to 28 of Appendix 3 to the Annex to S0T(70)2.    TheyHay be siunmarised as ensuring the development of space techniquesas a means of/pursuing ...
- 7 -pursuing policy objectives, avoiding complete dependence on nonEuropean sources for the new techniques made available by space research and development, and making European industry ascompetitive as possible with that of the US.    The UK objectivesare generally in line with these concepts.16   The interest of British industry is demonstrated by the factthat, although seeking Government support, firms are also committingtheir own money to the Phase B studies being undertaken by american firms to define the programme and provide cost and time-scale estimates.    It should be noted that continental firms arefollowing the same course.17   In discussions with the Americans they made it clear thatEurope must pay for its participation in the programme, i.e.,that the cost of work done by European firms must be met fromEuropean  sources,        either directly or through internationalfunding.   NASA will not contract with non-American firms (exceptfor special items not available in the US).    It follows therefore that European firms will only get work to the extent that   Europecontributes to the cost of the programme, except insofar as theycan obtain sub-contracts from US firms.18  Active industrial participation by United Kingdom firms ifEurope played a significant part in the project, could cover a wide range of techniques including structural design, design of avionicssystems, aerodynamics and electronics and a general access to information on the project would be available over a wide front.The emphasis on structures holds out the possibility of signi-ficantly increasing industrial capability in applications oftitanium and of composite materials (carbon fibres) to aircraftstructures.    Such benefits could be applied in any new aircraftproject within both civil and military fields.   Aerodynamicresearch might be involved over a fairly wide spectrum, especiallyin the area of high lift systems, flight test instrumentation and ground simulation techniques./Moreover, ..)
- 8 -moreover, the forms of organisation and methods of management invmich Europe would participate could produce benefits in many areas.19 It is not possible to quantify the benefits to be expected inthis area but it is clear from, our discussions with the americans that the benefits will be closely related to the extent of our participation.    While general information about all aspects of theprogramme (except the nuclear tug) will be available to Europeanparticipants and the possibility of exploiting such information byBeans of licence agreements with American firms, technologicaldata and working know-how will only be made available to europe to the extent that it is required for the purposes of directEuropean participation in the programme and for any necessary inter-faces with American contractors.20 fhe political arguments in favour of going ahead with a european programme,  including European participation in the Post-Apollo programme,carry great weightThey are set out in Appendix 1 to thec onsequencesAnnex to SCT(70)2.    It should be emphasised that serious political /could flow from a British decision to opt out of European spaceand Post-Apollo cooperation (the two march together because of the franco-German insistence on linking participation in applicationssatellites with launcher availability).    vVe should be setting our-selveo apart from our principal European partners in an area of collaboration which they regard as very important for the futureindustrial strength of Europe;   we should also have damaged our relationship with the United States.    Nor can we assume that itwould be easy for us to change our mind at a later date.   V/e should probably have to pay heavily for what our European partners, andthe Americans, would regard as a demonstration of snort-terminsularity even if the technical arrangements left room for us tocome in later.    ./e should in short have opted out and would haveto bear all the consequences.   One of these would be that Germanpreponderance in European space would give her a privileged industrial nd political position vis-a-vis the Americans, at our expense.    Ontoe other hand, by opting in we should be able to ally ourselves!&apos;ith the Germans in attempting to kill off the European launcher,tous isolating the French.
21    From the economic point of view the primary objective of theprogramme is to reduce cost of delivery to space of payloads whether in the form of application satellites or for the purpose of conductingscientific experiments. The economies depend on the number and type ofpayloads which are expected to be put into space. This is difficult toestimate particularly as reduction in the cost of putting payloadsinto orbit could be expected to increase the demand for launches.Moreover, if the shuttle system is successfully developed, although there is no US Department of Defense money supporting the project,the shuttle would be adopted for US military purposes.   Estimates of demand for launches in this area are not available because of defencereasons.   A supplementary benefit would be a reduction in payloadcosts because the experiments would not have to be designed to suchhigh standards as they are at present as the stresses to which theywould be submitted by the shuttle are considerably less than those,vhich apply when a conventional launcher is used.   Experiments could also be serviced or replaced in space and not lost if there weretechnical failures.22 The Americans expect to reduce by a significant factor perhapsas much as ten the cost of putting payloads into orbit.    Since it isexpected that the UK will participate in satellite activities eitherunilaterally, or multilaterally the financial savings arising fromthe use of the Post-Apollo transportation system could be appreciable.It is most unlikely that the UK would be able to secure these advantages if it did not participate in the programme.COST OP PARTICIPATION IN THE POST-APOLLO PROGRAMME23 The cost is extremely difficult to assess at this stage.    Firststudies by American firms suggested a cost of about $8 billion forthe shuttle and in discussions with the Lefevre Mission the american authorities suggested a cost for the shuttle and space tug of $10billion spread over ten years.    This expenditure would be expected topeak in the years 1975/1976.   A 10ft European contribution which the americans said they would regard as significant (and which theGerman Government are believed to favour) would involve a UK shareaveraging  10M per annum on a GNP basis with a peak around  15Min the mid 1970s.a
- 10 -24  No long term commitments have &quot;been undertaken in respectof the programme.    Only the UK share  0.2M to mid-1971 of the studies agreed in Brussels JHfus been approved.    In practice theprogramme would probably build up at a rate on the lines of :- M &apos;. &apos;1971/72        1972/73       1373/74        1974/751.0 2.5 7.5 15.0In the Public Expenditure Review no provision has been made forthis expenditure in Ministry of Technology estimates.    The costof participation in the Post-Apollo programme would have to be additional to funds now envisated for the Ministry of Technology.Our position is thus more difficult than that of Prance andGermany who have decided to embark on the development of EUROPA iii and could offset funds allocated to that project if it were abandoned in favour of participation in Post-Apollo.CONCLUSIONS25    i      Our possible benefits from participation in Post-Apollo,if it goes ahead, are likely to bea    . Assurance of access, for all purposes we are likelyto require, to much cheaper launching facilities fori satellites post-1978,b      A reduction in the cost of the development and production of satellites arising from changes whichcould be introduced in the philosophy of design,c       Industrial benefits, including not onlymaintenance of the ability to compete for spacework but also access to technology over a wide front,ii     On the other hand there is no guarantee that the programme will go ahead or any precision about what it will cost.    Thereis still no definite knowledge of the form European and british participation would be expected to take.    This could take manyforms - eg allocation to Europe of a particular section of the project; to pe completed at European cost and under Europeanmanagement;    allocation to each country of some sub-component: :or allocation of sub-contracts to European,firms underAmerican main contractors to the value of national contribution3 /All ...
All these have advantages and disadvantages, and we need todiscuss with Europe and with USA what is the best method,iii There are very strong political arguments, in the context of our relations both with Europe and with theUnited States, for the United Kingdom not to isolate itselfby opting out of European participation in the Post-apollo programme.26   with these broad considerations in mind; we recommend that ministers should agree to take the following line at the november ESC:i to accept that the UK regards this US response onlaunchers as a satisfactory basis on which to discussin depth with the Americans but without commitment thepossibilities for Post-Apollo European participation;and that the UK is confirmed in its view that a european launcher is unnecessary and is not preparedto participate in the EUROPA III programme as an interim measure.ii to reaffirm at the next ESC our intention to pay our share of the detailed studies of the Post-Apollocooperation and to make firm recommendations to the(   ESC as soon as is practicable;    this work to includestudy of the most appropriate form of the necessaryEuropean/American agreements.iii agree to confirm HMG^s readiness to proceed, on thebasis agreed at the Brussels ESC in July, with theproposed European programme, including the studies ofthe applications satellites and the establishment ofthe new European space organisation.
