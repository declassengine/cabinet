US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT56CP(70) 100 COPY NO2 November 1970CABINETEUROPEAN SPACE CONFERENCES POST-APOLLO programme memorandum by the Minister of Aviation Supply1, In his capacity as President of the European Space Conference(ESC), M Lefevre visited London on 27 October to discuss the forthcomingMinisterial conference in Brussels on 4-5 November.    M Lefevre, basinghis views on discussions he had had with other Member States made it plain that the United Kingdom would be pressed very strongly to give clearanswers to two questions:1.       Is the United Kingdom prepared to proceed with negotiations on the post-Apollo programme and ultimately topay its share of European participation provided that negotiations are successful?2.      Would the United Kingdom contribute to an interim launcherstudy fund of $35 million which would serve a double purpose of preparing for the post-Apollo programme and of providing a basis for alternative European launchers if the negotiations failed?The nature of any European participation would be agreed at a subsequentMinisterial Conference of the ESC,    The interim period would run from now until an agreement between Europe and the United States was signed,2.        We were also told that the French and Germans would drasticallyreduce their contributions to the European Space Research organisation to make up any shortfall in a United Kingdom contribution to the interimlauncher studies.    It was made clear this left us unmoved, but it is an indication of the importance they attach to this matter,3,        If my colleagues agree that we should proceed on the basis ofOption A of the Lord Privy Seal*s memorandum CP(70) 93, I propose thatwhile resisting United Kingdom participation in the $35 million programmeproposed by the French and Germans, I should be authorised to offer areasonable level of participation in further launcher studies solely related to the post-Apollo programme, up to a total of say  2 million spread overthe years 1971-72 and 1972-73,F c ministry of Aviation Supply SW12 November 1970
