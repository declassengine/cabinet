At the Cabinet meeting on 5 October (CM(70) 26th Conclusions,Minute 3) I was asked, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Social Services, to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the timing of the increase in charges in thesocial services field in relation to the introduction of the Family income supplement (FIS).2.        I attach a note by officials on this matter which points out thatsimultaneous implementation of the increases and of FIS would involvepostponing the introduction of the increased charges to the beginning ofAugust with a reduction in savings in 1971-72 of at least  25. 5 million.The note also points out, however, that under the existing remissionarrangements families at present exempt from paying charges because theirincomes are below the remission levels will be unaffected by the proposed increases (always providing, of course, that they take up their existingentitlements) and that these levels already cover family incomes well inexcess of the maxima admissible for families of comparable sise under theFIS scheme.COPY NO    h iCABINETR m home Office Sv7112 October 1970
MEASURES TO HELP THE POORER FAMILIES:  TIMINGNote by officials. In the Cabinet*s discussion on 5 October of the measures proposedto help the poorer families some disquiet was expressed at the gap betweenthe earliest date for the introduction of a Family Income Supplement (FIS),at the beginning of August 1971, and the prior commencement of the increasedhealth and school meal charges and the increased cost to families resultingfrom the withdrawal of the welfare milk subsidy (all of which would be effective by the beginning of April).    The Home Secretary was asked, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Social Services, to arrange for further consideration to be given to the timing of the increase in charges in relation to the introduction of FIS(CM(70) 26th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.        The existing remission arrangements, which the Cabinet have agreed should be further extended somewhat, are such as to guarantee protection against the increased charges and costs mentioned above to those alreadyqualified and, as the following table brings out, these arrangements alreadycover family incomes well in excess of the maxima admissible for families of comparable sise under the FIS scheme, restricted as this is to the verypoorest families.Income Levels attracting Minimum Payment of FIS (4s)and the largest Incomes still allowing maximumentitlement to other benefits: November 1970 levels	1	2	3	4	no. of	Family	Free	Free	One	Optical/children	Income	School	W elf are	Prescription	Dental(4-2       Supplement     Me ale			Milk	charge	charge sparents)		(children	(child	Remitted	Remitted		over 5	under 5				entitled)	entitled)			   s d	   s d	   s d	   s d	    s d1 (aged 4)	14 15 6	mm	18   1 6	18   3 0	18 10 62 (4 and 8)	15 15  6	19   5  6	20  9 6	20  4 6	20 12 63 (4, 8					and 11)	18 15  6	21   6   0	22   3 6	22   7 6	22 15  64 (4, 8,					11 &amp; 16)	20 15 6	23 15  5	25   0 6	26   4 6	25 13  65 (4, 8,					11, 14					&amp; 16)	12 15 6	25 15  0	28   8 6	28 12 6	29   1 61
Entries in columns 2 to 5 relating to the various benefits invariably exceed the entries in column 1 relating to FIS,    The position would not be materially altered even by an upratlng of the FIS make-up levels by asmuch as the  3 10s Od mentioned in SL(70) 11 as reflecting the estimatedmovement of earnings of the lower-paid by next August, bearing in mind that improved remission arrangements for the other benefits will by thenbe operative.    It follows therefore that, strictly speaking, the present gap in timing between the dates of implementation of the increases in charges and of the FIS scheme would not concern those who would benefit from thelatter and who would at all times have been able to qualify for the maximumrelief from the charges.3.        The conclusion in the last paragraph does of course assume thatthose now eligible for the benefits mentioned would proceed to take them uppending the introduction of FIS,    If Ministers saw presentational advantage in simultaneous implementation of the increases and of FIS this must involvepostponing the effective date of the increases until the beginning of Augustbecause it is not possible to bring FIS forward before that date.    Thiswould mean a loss of at least one-third of a year&apos;s savings from theproposed charges and the withdrawal of the welfare milk subsidy (the exactfigures depending on the extent to which It would otherwise be possible to institute the new charges before April 1971).    The total savings involved in1971-72 have been put at  86 million.    One-third of this is  20, 6 million,but against this could be offset a reduction in the cost of the variousmitigating measures (adjustment of remission scales and some improvementin take-up) which could similarly-be postponed, which might amount to 3 million.    The net loss in 1971-72 would therefore be not less than 25.6 million.2
