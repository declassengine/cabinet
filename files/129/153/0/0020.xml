DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(70) 95 COPY NO27tb. October 1970CABINETTHE REFORM OF HOUSING finance memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Secretary of State for WalesAt its meeting on 23 October the Home Affairs Committee agreed in principle to proposals for the reform of housing finance and asked that they should be submitted to the Cabinet, together with the draft of aStatement in the House o? Commons explaining them in broad outline,2.     Our Election Manifesto and The Queenrs Speech commit us to theearly reform of housing finance.    Some aspects of the proposals for thisreform were covered by papers CP(70) 64 and CP(70) 75 and discussed in cabinet on 1 and 14 October.    This paper sets out the proposals more fully.    They are designed to deal with the problems comprehensively andin accordance with our economic and social philosophy.    They would begin to come into effect in 1972-73,3.     The proposals start from the premise that measures for encouraging-ing owner-occupation and the improvement and modernisation of ourolder houses can be taken without drastically revising the legislation -mostly recent - which relates to their finance and that the economicdistortions and social injustices which mar the present system are bestdealt with by eliminating the major financial anomalies which now govern the rented sector.    The proposals would stimulate the trend towards homeownership and would result in relatively more support from public funds formodernisation and improvement.4.     In summary, the proposals would?-i.    Establish fair rents for all unfurnished tenancies, exceptfor the public sector in. Scotland (see paragraph 9 below).ii.     Provide for a statutory progression from present public sector rents to the new rent level by means of annual increases averaging 15s. a week (with a maximum of  1 aweek for any dwelling).iii.    Introduce a comprehensive rent rebate scheme forunfurnished public and private tenancies to be administered by local authorities and financed partly by the Exchequerand partly by local authorities.1
iv.    Recast the system of subsidies for local authority housingby withdrawing existing subsidies over a period j and substitute subsidies for slum cleax*ance, and for authorities with rapidly increasing costs and with deficits in their housing accounts,5.     The present principles for determining rents are haphazard andcontradictory.    In the private sector some 1, 3 million unfurnishedtenancies are subject to rent regulation i. e. to the determination underthe Rent Acts of a &quot;fair&quot; rentf which is the market rent with the exclusion of any element due to scarcity.    A further 1. 4 million tenanciesare controlled i, e. their rent has not moved since 1957 and is generallyless than  la week outside London and 30s. a week or less in London.In the public sector the rents of dwellings owned by local authoritiesa^d p.rtw towns are based on the historic cost of providing each authorify &apos;sstock, plus the current cost of repairs and management, but are keptbelow this cost by Exchequer subsidies and in some cases (particularlyin Scotland and London) by rate fund contrifoutfons.   Historic and geographical factors, and the local authorities&apos; wide discretion to adjust their effect on rents, give rise to different rents for similar dwellingsin different local authorities.    Only about one-seventh of all Exchequersubsidies are used for rent rebates and many authorities have no (or only an inadequate) rent rebate scheme.    The remaining subsidies are used largely to keep down the rents of tenants, who could well afford topay more, to levels far below the value of the dwellings.6.     We propose that we should eliminate these artificial distinctionsby making the fair rents principle govern the rents of all unfurnishedtenants, public and private wherever this is practicable.    This would create a unified market for rented accommodation in which the house-holder&apos;s choice between a municipal and a private landlord would not bedistorted.    It would also provide a basis for determining rents whichwould progressively respond to the free play of the market as housingshortages are eliminated, but would keep out the scarcity factor in those areas where shortages persisted.FAIR RENTS FOR PRIVATE TENANTS7.     We said in our Manifesto that we would continue the process -started under the last Governments Housing Act of 1969 - of graduallyextending the fair rent system to the remaining controlled tenancies.For houses improved under the 1969 Act, we propose to cut down fromfour years to two years the period before a full fair rent can be charged;and to simplify the procedures under that Act, which are too complicatedto give full encouragement to landlords to improve their property.    we propose further that other houses still let on controlled tenancies shouldpass into rent regulation in batches, and that all should have fair rentsfixed on doing so.    There will be over a million of these houses and the rent officer service, which is dealing at present with some 70,000 cases a year, will need to be expanded to deal with them.    If it were possible todeal with 100, 000 such tenancies every half year, it would take some four2
years or longer for all to be dealt with after allowing for their continuedfall in numbers.    After the completion of this task, rent officers wouldbe concerned only with keeping fair rents up to date and we could thenset about reducing the size of the service.    Where fair rents were fixed,controlled rents would rise to them by at the mosts three annual steps(i. e. over a period of two years).    Over the two year period increases would average about  3 a week in London and about  2 a week elsewhere.Rent allowances would protect the poorer tenants from hardship arisingfrom the rent increases.8.     Many houses containing controlled tenancies are in a poor stateoi repair and this would influence the fair rent Sixed for them.    The move from outdated controlled rents to fair rents and the enhancement in rentswhV-h would follow from repair and improvement would help landlords toput in order many dwellings which would otherwise sink into slumdom.We do not think that it would be rsasenable to make the move to fair rentsdependent cn repairs and improvement as controlled rents are soinadequate.    But experience of fair rents already determined suggeststhat the rent of unfit dwellints (i. e0 those incapable of being put intosatisfactory order at reasonable expense) would not normally go up greatlyand in some cases would actually go down.RENTS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR9.      We are agreed that our legislation should provide for the intro-duction of fair rents for council dwellings in England and Wales.    But weare also agreed that the introduction of fair rents is not at presentpracticable in Scotland.    There are virtually no private rented housescomparable to the majority of council houses.    Further, because of the much larger proportion of council houses in Scotland, it would beimpossible to establish machinery which could fix fair rents in the time available.    The proposal is therefore to raise public sector rents inScotland to the true rent level i. e. the level which is sufficient to balance the Housing Revenue Account of each authority.     True rents maywell involve higher rents than fair rents would produce in Scotland.    Butas progress is made towards true rents, the possibility of moving to fairrents will be re-examined.    In any event the a^wl progression inScotland towards true rents will be in step with the progression inEngland and Wales towards fair rents.10.     It is proposed that in England and Wales local authorities shouldhave the primary responsibility for fixing fair rents for their own houses.There would be severe practical difficulties in expanding the rent officerservice to cope with this task.    As democratically elected bodies localauthorities should be concerned to carry out the duties put on them by statute in a fair and reasonable way.    But unlike private landlords,they are not concerned to maximise the returns from their properties.Some authorities may be politically averse from raising rents to the fair rent level, especially as it involves a departure from the principle, which
has hitherto obtained, that local authority housing is a non-profit makingservice; others may resent the loss of the discretion they now enjoy inrent fixing.    It is therefore necessary to have safeguards to ensure thatthe authorities carry out their duties with due regard to the relativeinterests of the taxpayersB the ratepayers and the tenants.11.    We therefore envisage that the local authorities&apos; proposals tothis end should be submitted to the Rent Assessment Committees tosecure that they were broadly in line with determinations in the private sector.     In the event of unresolved disagreement between a RentAssessment Committee and a local authority, there would be adjudicationby a statutory tribunaL    A procedure along these lines should provide sufficient reassurance to tenants that rents have been fixed in accord with fair rent principles, and would obviate the need to give individualrights of appeal (as exist in the private sector), which would strain the rent-fixing machinery to breaking point.    The Lord Chancellor will be consulted about the best way to secure these objectives.12.    Any estimate of the likely level of fair rents in the public sector is bound to be speculative, becausa the stock of local authority dwellings isvery different in age and character from the private dwellings to which the fair rent system has so far applied,i.    As regards England and Wales, the best estimate that can be made - which involves massive extrapolation -suggests that average fair rents in 1975-76 for councildwellings might be of the following orders-North of England	 4.	15s.	Od	per	weMidlands, East Anglia- and					South West	 5 to  5.	15 s.	Od	tt	ttSouth East of England				I	(excluding London)	 6.	10s.	Od	tt	ttLondon	 7.	10s.	Od	tr	ttWales	 4.	5s.	Od	tr	it by comparison, on 31 March 1972 - *he date on which thepresent system of housing finance should end - the averageunrebated council rent in England and Wales under thepresent system is expected to be around  2.   10s.   Od a week.ii.     In Scotland the average unrebated rent on 31 March 1972 isexpected to be about 35s a week.    The average true rent in1975-76 might be about  4 a week.13.    We also propose that each local authority should be under a duty to increase its rents annually under rules designed to secure a prescribed average annual rent increase.    The Home Affairs committee considered that this should be about 15s a week (with a maximum annual increase of  1 a v/eek for any dwelling in Great Britain) until the rent ofevery dwelling reached the new level.    This would secure that the new4
rent levels were substantially achieved in 1975-76, except in Scotland,London and the South East of England.    By the time these rent levelswere generally achieved, rent would account for about 12 per cent -14 per cent of the gross household income of council tenants before tax,as against about 8 per cent currently in England and Wales and even lessin Scotland.    Annual rent increases of 15s. and  la week in rent mightabsorb about 30 per cent and 40 por cent respectively of the average increase in household income after tax (assuming an average increase in money incomes of Sir per cent a year) for tenants whose means madethem, ineligible for rent rebates.14.     These proposals involve a degree of compulsion on localauthorities which their associations may find unpalatable.    But this is inevitable if we are to secure a consistent rent pattern and a commonrate of progression towards achieving it.A NATIONAL RENT REBATE SCHEME15.    At its meeting on 14 October the Cabinet agreed in principle tothe proposal that rent rebates should be available to public tenants andrent allowances to private tenants of unfurnished accommodation underthe same national scheme and that these rebates and allowances shouldbe administered by the local authorities who would contribute towards their cost.    We envisage that the Exchequer should meet 75 per cent ofthe cost of rebates and allowances and local authorities should meet theremaining 25 per cent and the cost of administration.    Each localauthority would be under a duty to operate a scheme of rent rebates and allowances for the public and private tenants in its area which, inrespect of its main feature would be not less favourable than a modelscheme prescribed by the Secretary of State.    This would be on thegeneral lines of the scheme which has been put to the Home AffairsCommittee.    We must recognise that, with rent rebates as with rentfixing, the local authorities would find them existing discretion largelyeliminated.SUBSIDIES - ENGLAND AND WALES Vl16.     Present estimates suggest that in the great rix^j^iity of localauthorities in England and Wales the income from fair rents would eventually exceed the costs falling on the Housing Revenue Account andso lead to surpluses in that Account,     These surpluses would beavailable to abate the rent of poorer tenants and would greatly reduce theneed for Exchequer subsidy.    Total subsidies would be progressively reduced as the progression to fair rents produced a margin of rent incomeover costs and this reducing total of subsidy should be redistributed so asto provide incentives to slum clearance and new building where it is most needed.    Such a redistribution can be effective only if all existingsubsidies are progressively withdrawn.    Local government opinion is increasingly coming to accept this as an inevitable feature of a new deal in housing finance.    Without it we could not achieve a sensible new system or the planned savings in public expenditure.    But local5
authorities will probably make at? argument against the withdrawal ofthose subsidies which they can claim to have relied on in framing their current building programme.17.     The following main measures are therefore proposed:-?i.    Existing subsidies would be withdrawn at a rate which,after some allowance for the effect on the Housing revenue account of increases in costs, would broadly corresponds to the rate (15s a week) at which average rents were increased towards the fair rent leveL    Those authorities with the greatest housing problems would retain some oftheir existing subsidies longest, as such authorities havethe largest entitlement to the existing subsidies.    At leasthalf the authorities outside London v/ould have all theirexisting subsidies withdrawn in 1972-73.ii.     To provide an incentive to new building for authoritiessubject tc sharply rising costs any authority without a surplus in its Housing Revenue Account would receive a rising costs subsidy towards substantial increases inthe average cost per dwelling if these exceeded a specified level in any year.iii. If, after an authority had raised its rents in accordancewith the prescribed progression toiair rencs, or had reached fair rent levels, its rent income failed to cover the costs falling on the Housing Revenue Account, (after allowing for any rising costs subsidy under ii), it would receive an Exchequer subsidy of 75 per cent of the deficitand would have to meet the remaining 25 per cent by separately fund contribution.iv. In order to encourage slum clearance, the exchequer would meet 75 per cent of the net loss to the ratesincurred by local authorities in acquiring and clearingslum land in those cases where the value of the clearedsite for housing or some other new u.se  teless thanthe cost of acquisition and clearance.    As slum clearanceoperations cannot readily be distinguished fromcomprehensive planning redevelopment carried out under existing legislation, there would be a common landaccount for both types of transaction and a common rateof subsidy.v. A local authority would be allowed to reduce a voluntaryor deficit rate fund contribution below the 1971-72 level as long as such a reduction did not give rise to a deficitsubsidy and would be allowed to use a surplus in theHousing Revenue Account for such a reduction.    Subject
to this every authority would be obliged to pay any surplus into the General Rate Fund and to apply it,first, towards the cost of rent rebates and allowances(the 75 per cent Exchequer contribution made for thispurpose would be correspondingly reduced) and, if any surplus remained, towards the cost of specified housing expenditure which was not borne on the Housing revenue account (e. g. the net loss on slum clearance in iv above).If this did not exhaust the surplus, the balance would accrue to the General Rate Fund and the Exchequer in proportion 25 g 75.SCOTLANDla     In Scotland the proposed subsidy arrangements will as far aspossible be similar to those in England and Wales, but will have to be adapted to the true rents basis of fixing Council rents and to the present high level of rate fund contributing (see paragraph 23 below).19.     1  the Cabinet consider that our proposals in paragraphs 15-18are broadly on the right lines, we would propose to consult with theChancellor of the Exchequer about the detailed provisions, and inparticular about the rate of the new subsidies and the Exchequer contribu-tions towards the cost of the national rent rebate scheme,TIMETABLE20.     It would be wrong to make this much needed reform wait on local government reorganisation.    It is essential that the proposed new system should come into operation in 1972-73 and that the necessary legislation should be included in the 1971-72 programme.     otherwise the withdrawal of existing subsidies might not be substantially completed during the present Parliament and the predicted savings in public expenditure resulting from the change to the new ay stem would not materialise by 1974-75 and 1975-76.    Even with the introduction of the changes in 1972-73, the prescribed rent increases towards the new rentslevel will co&amp;tlnue well into the next Parliament.    In any case althoughthe necessary long, complicated and controve-&quot;c&apos;?-&apos;r,-l Bills would need to beintroduced very early in the 1971-72 Session, they could, hardly been acted before the summer of 1972.    This would make it more difficultto give effect to the new system for the whole of the financial year1972-73 and the Bills would need to be so framed as to induce localauthorities to introduce the first annual prescribed rent increase at thebeginning of 1972-73.21.    As the Bills will need to be introduced in the House of Commonsvery early in the 1971-72 Session v/e must undertake the consultations with the local authority associations, to which we are committed, assoon as possible so that drafting can be put in hand in good time.    Weshould aim at opening these detailed discussions by 1 December 1970.7
FINANCIAL CONSFQUENCES OF THE PROPOSALS22.    Any estimate of the financial consequences of these proposals must be somewhat speculative because many of their constituent itemsparticularly the likely level of fair rents and the rate fund contributions which local authorities might decide to make if the present systemcontinued cannot readily be predicted.    The proposals in this paperare estimated to lead to the following net saving in public expenditure at current prices.  million	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-Saving to Exchequer	95	230	300	320Saving to rates	-45	-20	5	25Net saving	50	210	305	34523.     These proposals raise one major problem of transition.    Theamount of housing subsidies borne on the rates is increased in the early years of the transition period whereas the amount borne by the exchequer is reduced.    This effect is due to the proposal to charge to the rates25 per cent of the cost of rent rebates and allowance,  includingrebates and allowances for Supplementary Benefit tenants, as well as25 per cent of any deficit in the Housing Revenue Account.    In Scotlandand London many authorities would for some years continue to makeeven higher rate fund contributions than at present because they wouldhave to meet both 25 per cent of the cost of rent rebates and allowances and the rate fund contribution inherited from the existing system whichthey would be able to reduce only gradually by increases in rent.    we propose to consider with the Chancellor of the Exchequer what transitionalprovision may be needed to moderate these effects.MANPOWER24.    Whilst the detailed manpower implications of the changes proposedin the public sector cannot be worked out witlir^: further discussior withthe local authority associations, the present view is that the extra work involved in a national rent rebate scheme would be compensated both in local government and in the Department of the Environment by thesimplification of the present very complicated arrangements for claimingand paying subsidy.    Our Departments are considering with theDepartment of Health and Social Security what, if any, net staffingchanges will arise from the national rent rebate scheme in connectionwith the administration of Supplementary Benefit.    The additionaldetermination of fair rent arising from the decontrol of controlled rentswould make it necessary to take on additional staff for the 4 years1973-76 over which the decontrol operation would be spread.    Thepresent estimate, which is being examined further, is that for this special requirement it would be necessary to recruit 1400 additional8
staff in the rent officer service and 200 stiff supporting the RentAssessment Committees.    After the completion of this task it wouldbe possible to set about reducing numbers.    The staff taken on would inthe main be of an age which would not stand in the way cf such reductionsonce the peak requirement was passed.    The additional cost of the staff has been included in the cost estimates in paragraph 22 above.WHITE PAPER25.     The Home Affairs Committee doubted whether a White paper explaining the Governments proposals would serve a useful purpose.The Committee felt that it might instead prolong controversy and that itwould be preferable to follow an early statement by detailed consultations with the interests concerned and then to proceed straight to legislation.26.    Annex 1 is a draft of the statement which the Secretary of Statefor the Environment would propose to make next week in the House ofCommons explaining the main features of this reform.CONCLUSION27.    We are confident that a reform on the lines proposed in the papercan be presented in a way which will commend itself to cur supporters,to informed opinion and to the public at large.    By concentratingsubsidies on those who most need help with their housing costs and on local authorities with the heaviest burdents, we shall be seen to becarrying out our promise to see that the full weight of government assistance goes behind tackling the worst areas of the housing problem.By removing the distortions in housing finance introduced in legislation of the past half-century, we shall be creating conditions in which the citizen will be encouraged to take more responsible decisions inchoosing housing most suited to his needs.    By restoring equity to theprivate rented sector we shall not only be seen to be remedying a long-standing injustice to landlords; we shall create the indispensableconditions for rescuing much of our existing housing stock and giving ita longer lease of life.    At the same time, by cutting out indiscriminatesubsidies we shall make substantial savings in public expenditure.    Ofcourse there is certain to be intense opposition A on: tenants, many *ocalauthorities and from the Opposition, am we must expect public controversy from the time we consult with the local authority associationsuntil at least the end of this Parliament.    But we are confident thatunbiased opinion will recognise that our reforms are both urgently needed to restore economic sense to housing and to provide a soundfinancial base for a vigorous and rational housing policy and that theyhave their proper place in the Governments general package of economicand social measures.9
28.     We invite the Cabinet **i.       to approve the proposals in this paper with a view to early consultations with the local authority associations,on the understanding that, there would be further consulta-tions with the Lord Chancellor on the machinery for fixingfair rents in the public sector in England and Wales(paragraph 11), and with the Chancellor of the exchequer on the detailed proposals for the withdrawal of existingsubsidies and the introduction of new subsidies for rent rebates and other purposes (paragraphs 15 - 18);ii.      to approve a statement on the lines of the draft at annex 1;iiL       to endorse the view of the Home Affairs Committee thata White Paper was not desirable (paragraph 25).P wG CP t department of the Environment, SWl27 October 197010
ANNEX draft STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THEENVIRONMENT1 .        Mr. Speaker, 1 wish to make a statement on some of the broad decisions of principle on the basis of which we propose to change the structure of housing finance.2.        Under the present system ratepayers and taxpayers are beingfaced with a large and rapidly growing subsidy bill, and the subsidiesare not distributed in accordance with the current needs, and the rentspaid by tenants are related neither to the value and quality of theiraccommodation nor to their capacity to pay.    The help available to the poorer tenant is incomplete and haphazard.    The present system of rent control in the private sector has resulted in a serious deterioration in the condition of privately rented houses.3.        My rt. hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales and I have worked out a strategy for reform, but before our planscan be perfected we will need to consult the local authorities and other interested parties.4. We intend to introduce a pattern of rents which will remove the  npresent artificial distinctions and inequalities between private and publicsectors and within each of them.5. The fair rent principle has become generally recognised asan equitable basis of determining rent structures.    I am glad to paytribute to the Party opposite for introducing this principle.    We nowintend to take the natural step of extending it within the private sector .At the same time we shall apply it to local authority dwellings in Englandand Wales.(i.        We intend to see that controlled tenancies will progress more rapidly into rent regulation and have a fair rent determined for themthus preventing thousands of dwellings sinking  into decay and encouraging the improvement and repair of these properties.
(CONFIDENTIAL)7,     In the local authority sector the fair rent principle will beapplied over a transitional period and there will be a limit set to theincrease of rent in any one year.8.     In order to see that poorer tenants are not prevented fromoccupying accommodation suited to their needs because of their inability to afford the rent we will introduce a comprehensive systemof rent rebates and allowances for all of those in need.   Any tenantof unfurnished accommodation who cannot afford to meet the full newrent will be able to obtain a reduction which would have proper regard10 his income and family commitments.    This help will not only beavailable to council tenants through a standardised rent rebate schemebut it will also be made available to tenants in the private sector bymeans of an entirely new system of rent allowances for those tenantswho need them.    Subject to discussion with their associations we contemplate that the local authorities will operate the scheme and thatihe Exchequer will meet the greater part of the cost.9.     Under the previous system of subsidies, the system which will nowbe entirely recast,  only one-seventh of the subsidies went into rent rebates.    This Government intends to see by statute that subsidies from public funds will be directed towards those people who need them.10.   There are two further major changes we intend to make in thesubsidy system.    The Government does not consider that the presentsubsidy system for slum clearance is adequate to meet the problem and we intend to improve the assistance provided to relieve the high cost ofslum clearance.1&apos; .   Secondly in those areas where there is serious overcrowding new building is often exceptionally costly.    It is therefore our intentionto give special assistance to those authorities who need it to meet thehigh cost of tackling the related problems of overcrowding and obsolescentPage 2    _(confidential)
(confidential12,  We intend to continue a major drive for the improvement and rehabilitation of older houses.I).   In Scotland my rt hon friend has concluded that, because of the(Terent nature and the relative number of privately and publiclyrented houses,  the fair rent formula cannot be applied at present tocouncil houses.    However,  in consulting the Scottish local authority associations he will be making proposals which for the next few years willhave broadly the same financial effects as those which I have outlinedfor England and Wales,  and will provide for the same rate ofprogression in rents.
