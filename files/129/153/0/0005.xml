IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS Government p* r-*CP(70) 80 COPY NO        J &quot;12 October 1970CABINETTHE ENERGY SCENEMemorandum, by the Minister of technology, On 21 July the Cabinet invited my predecessor to circulate a paper on &quot;fuel policy and the measures of protection and support for coal&quot;(CM(70) 7th Conclusions, Minute 7, Conclusion 2),    This paper outlineswhere we should try to go in the longer term and seeks certain immediatedecisions particularly on the general contents of the Coal Bill to which weare committed by the Lord Presidents statement of 16 July.THE BASIC TRENDS2, Chart 1 shows United Kingdom energy consumption from 1950 to1975.    The dominant feature is the steady decline of coal (200 million tons and 90 per cent of the energy market in 1950: 160 million tons and50 per cent in 1969) and growth of oil (22 million tons coal equivalent and10 per cent of the energy market in 1950; 135 million tons and over 40 percent in 1969).    This change, which is common to all Western Europe,reflects the convenience and price advantage of oil.    It will continuebut oil will meet increasing competition from nuclear power and, moreparticularly, natural gas.    Though coal!s share of the market willcontinue to decline, it will be a big industry for many years to come,IMMEDIATE PROSPECTS3.        These are awkward and may continue so for two or three years.Coal demand this winter is likely to exceed supply by several million tons, with National Coal Board (NCB) stocks falling below their present level of 9i million tons (much of it poor) compared with at least15 million tons of good coal which they should hold.    Fuel oil supplieshave also become tight and prices have risen.    Generating capacity willbe barely adequate to meet maximum demand.    Strikes or unusuallysevere weather could put us in real trouble.    There is no prospectof substantial alleviation by coal imports - the tightness is world-wide -or from an immediate change in the pattern of fuel use.
GOVERNMENT ROLE4, Successive Governments as in other countries have paid particular attention to energy. This reflects its basic importance to the community and such specific continuing factors as:-1,       The importance of cheap energy.    For most industries fuelmakes up about 3 per cent of total costs but for some it is much higher (eg cement about 26 per cent; chlorine 20-45 per cent;aluminium 15 per cent;  iron and steel 13 per cent).2.      The rate of utilisation of the North Sea natural gas fields -a major new source of energy under our control costing much lessin foreign exchange than oil.&quot;3.    The balance of payments cost of growing use of oil (net costof oil imports about  400 million in 1968) and the risks ofinterruption of supply (80 per cent coming from the Middle Eastand North Africa with little substitution possible).(Note:   The gross cost of retained imports was  740 million in 1968.    The net cost allows for the use of British tankers,the sterling element in British companies&apos; overseas costs and investment in tiie United Kingdom by foreign oil companies. )&quot;4.      The social and regional implications of the reductionin mining manpower - down from 700, 000 in 1956 to under300,000 now, with three-quarters of the fall in development and intermediate areas,CURRENT FUEL POLICY5.        Since the early 1960s Governments have encouraged the move to a four-fuel economy but have sought to moderate the changes whichwould result from competitive forces alone so as to manage the rundownof the coal industry and encourage the use of the new indigenous fuels,natural gas and nuclear power, rather than imported oil.    measures now in force are:-1.       A duty on heavy oil introduced in 1961 as a revenue raiserand likely to bring in over  120 million to the Exchequer this year,2.      A virtual ban on coal imports which has operated for morethan a decade.3, Control of the conversion of coalfired power stations to otherfuels and of the fuelling of new stations.

4,      Powers under the Coal Industry Act 1967 which expire on31 March 1971 and which ax*e not now in use, to subsidise the useof extra coal by the electricity and gas industries (the 1967 Actprovided for a total expenditure for this purpose of  45 million.Actual expenditure was  21 million).ASSESSMENT6.        My assessment of this policy is:-1.       The introduction of North Sea gas is going v/ell and should bring big economic benefits.    The gas industry is expected to takeby the mid-70s about 4,000 million cubic feet a day (over 50 million tons of coal equivalent a year) - most of it already contracted for.This gas is cheap; unlike coal and oil, is sulphur freej and will reduce the import bill by  100 million a year in terms of foreign exchange.2,      Nuclear power is largely indigenous and has balance ofpayments advantages.    But even the latest nuclear stations arebarely competitive with the most modern oil burning stations after taking into account the fuel oil tax; and nuclear energy may not nowbe competitive with untaxed oil before the late 1970s,3,      The contraction of the coal industry over the past decade hasbeen a major achievement.    The real cost of coal fell during the1960s but the outlook now is decidedly uncertain.    The level ofcoal support is already higher than is justified economically,A big increase in costs would raise major issues about the relianceof the electricity industry on coal (over 70 per cent of primary fuelused in 1970).4.      The growth in the use of oil brings the economic advantageof a cheap and convenient fuelj and about 40 per cent of oilconsumption is for transport and other uses (eg petrochemicals)where there is no practical alternative.    It also brings balanceof payments costs and security risks.    These can be reduced byimporting crude rather than products.    It is satisfactory that thisyear we have almost achieved sufficient United Kingdom refiningcapacity to cover our demand for products (including bunkers); andthat the provision of new capacity should in the long run keep pace with the growing demand for oil products.FRAMEWORK FOR ENERGY7.        Clearly we need to look closely at several aspects of the energyscene eg the level of support for coal demand and the pattern of fuel usein power stations.    Generally I want to move as far as practical towards
a position in which the major decisions in the energy sector re3t clearlywith those who carry the commercial and industrial responsibility.Government intervention for reasons of national energy balance wouldbe confined to a few broad measures if these are necessary to secure a satisfactory relationship between prices and costs and to measuresof insurance against a scarcity of fuel.    This move will raise suchmajor questions as S-1, The relationship betv/een the Government and the nationalisedenergy industries (which is being studied by the business advisers).2,      Insurance against short-term fluctuations in energy demand and supply - a commercial matter for the industries as well as a security one for the Government,3, The handling of prices particularly of the nationalised energyindustries in a situation of imperfect competition,4.      The organisation of nuclear research and development.5,      The long-term prospects of the coal industry and the properlevel of protection of coal and the other indigenous fuels,I am working on all these questions taking into account the development ofother relevant policies eg on the nationalised industries, on competition and on the regions0    If the negotiations for entry to the european economic Community (e.c.) succeed we shall have to give even greaterweight to keeping our energy prices competitive with those in Europe,We shall also have to take into account the common energy policy whichthe Six are aiming to develop; but they are so far at an early stage andI would not expect anything inconsistent with my general approach,THE PACE OF CHANGE8.        We should move gradually because:-1.       We are faced by major uncertainties eg about the level ofcoal production and demand and the performance of nuclear plant.There is always the hope of a major discovery of oil or furtherfinds of gas under our control.    All this points towards keepingour options open by not making earlier than necessary major changes which it may be impractical to reverse,2.      The difficult short-term position (paragraph 3) demandscaution about measures which might have a bad effect on miningmorale or recruitment.
3,       There is a big management problem of increasing productivity and maintaining the necessary skilled manpower -including managers - in a contracting industry.    Too fast a run-down could so increase these difficulties and damage the morale of those in the pits - with the danger of strikes, high absenteeismand low productivity - that the very large amount of coal which we will still need will either not be available or available only atexcessive cost,4, Coal production capacity once closed cannot be reopened.Measures which will reduce capacity should only be taken when we are sure that it will not be needed again,THE NEXT STEPS9,        Gas and Oil,I am satisfied that policy is on the right general lines (paragraph 6)although I think there should be more conversions of power stations to the use of these fuels (see paragraph 11),    We shall also need tokeep under review the level of the fuel oil duty in the light of thedevelopment of our general policy.    Our dependence for 80 percent of our oil on unstable areas inevitably leaves us vulnerable.Home refining helps but larger stocks are the only effective safeguard?and I am considering what can be done when the present tanker shortageeases,10,       Nuclear Energy,I have put in hand a full-scale review of thermal reactors in consultationwith the Atomic Energy Authority (sea), Central Electricity GeneratingBoard (CEGB) and nuclear industry.    This will give up-to-date information on the costs of nuclear generation.    Following the Cabinet discussion on28 September (CM(70) 23rd Conclusions) I am also examining the transferelsewhere of part of the costs of reactor research and development nowborne by the Exchequer,11.        Coal.We must reduce the present level of support for coal demand; but for thereasons in paragraph 8 we need to do so carefully, watching closely thebalance between supply and demand.    The powers under the Coal industry act 1967 to subsidise the use of extra coal by the electricity and gasindustries and to subsidise the NCB for the deferment of colliery closuresare not now being used.    I do not propose to renew them when they expirein March 1971.    To reassure the miners that the rundown of the industry will not get out of hand I would say publicly that we will consider sympathetically the reintroduction of measures of this kind if contraryto present expectations a real need for them should occur.    In addition:-
1,        I propose gradually to allow the conversion o  coalfired power stations to oil or gas in appropriate cases.    This will reduce theelectricity industry&apos;s dependence on coal.    An important start hasbeen made with the authorisation this year of the conversion of 10stations displacing up to 10 million tons of coal next year.    TheSecretary of State for Scotland and I are now consideringapplications for immediate authority to convert a furtherfive stations and we have in hand in consultation with thetwo industries a study of the effects of conversions proposedby the South of Scotland Electricity Board,    When that studyis finished decisions will be needed about conversions in Scotland?or other ways may have to be considered to ensure that Scottishindustry is not damaged by high coal and electricity prices,2,      I shall be considering the possibility of gradually relaxing the ban on coal imports - we shall in any case have to lift it for imports from other members if v/e join the e.c.,    The NCB andthe British Steel Corporation are studying imports of coking coal,and I am pressing them to let me have their views quickly.    Thereis a good case for letting in other special types, particularly solidsmokeless fuels, which are also scarce.    But only very few imports are likely to be available in the short terrnj the miners are particularly sensitive on this question;  and we need to takecare lest in the present tight supply position imports are morethan offset by a loss of home production,12,       Inevitably colliery manpower will continue to decline.    The rateof decline is now restricted by the need to get enough coal to match demand.But some time, perhaps several years ahead, the rundown needed ifsupply is to keep in line with the reduced demand will get bigger andmay exceed the 10 per cent which the NCB have advised is the maximumannual rate which is manageable.    We shall need to keep the rate ofrundown under review in the light of developments in the coal industryand employment problems in the less prosperous regions,13,       I intend to make it clear to the NCB that once stocks have been restored to a safe level, it is their responsibility to take whatever measures are required to keep production in line with reduced demand.    But with so many uncertainties v/e cannot rule out the sudden development of either an embarrassing surplus or a scarcity of coal,    I shall be exploring with thecoal and electricity industries what can be done by way of insurance against these continuing risks.THE COAL BILL14. The role of the Coal Bill in this general strategy will be to empower us to continue to help the men most severely affected bycontraction of the industry,.    This is essential if the policy of reducing
support for coal demand is to be pushed through successfully; and it is theright thing to do.    I shall be putting detailed proposals to the ministerial committee on Economic Policy.    Briefly I have in mind that the Bill, inaddition to dealing with certain miscellaneous matters, should provideuntil 31 March 1974 for:-1.       Special compensation for redundant miners at a net costof about  12 million after talcing into account state benefits thatwould otherwise be payable ( 25 million gross).2.      A reducing contribution to NCB social costs up to a totalof  24 million and eliminated by March 1974.Provision for both the figures in 1 and 2 has been made in thecurrent public expenditure review.The miscellaneous matters to be covered would include the NCB^ deficitlimit - the present one of  50 million is likely to be exceeded in thecurrent financial year - and the introduction of adequate control over their diversified activities.A COAL STRIKE15.       A major national coal strike would create a new situation.This would not affect my general objectives.    It would create a serious and continuing scarcity of coal, a very difficult managerial task of restoring morale in the industry and an immediate need for financial support to the NCB.    We shall have to consider this situation if it arises.But my thinking now is that it would require both toughness and generosity(toughness in allowing coal imports and in speeding the switch from coal toother fuels (which the strike itself would hasten) by authorising all theconversions which the electricity industry could carry out and for whichalternative fuel was available: generosity in continuing to help those affected by the accelerated contraction of the industry which would inevitably follow.CONCLUSIONS16,       I ask my colleagues to:-1.       Endorse my general approach towards a more competitiveframework for energy (paragraph 7).2. Agree that support for coal demand should be reduced by the gradual conversion of coalfired power stations to oil or gas and bya gradual relaxation of the ban on coal imports (paragraph 11).
3.      Agree that, subject to detailed examination by the ministerial committee on Economic Policy, the Coal Bill should contain theprovisions outlined in paragraph 14.4,      Take note of the arrangements I have made to review (inconsultation with the other Departments concerned):-a. Nuclear strategy (paragraph 10).b. Possible action to improve our ability to cope with a sudden surplus or scarcity of coal (paragraph 13).J DMinistry of Technology SW112 October 1970
