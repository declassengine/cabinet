NEW POLICIES FOR PUBLIC SPENDINGINTRODUCTION1J In a statement in the House of Commons on 27 October theChancellor of the Exchequer announced new policies for the public sector and their implications for public expenditure. The principles underlyingthese; policies were explained in that statement.2. This White Paper summarises the effects of the new policies onthe public expenditure programmes. Where these policies affect families&apos;outgoings, the Paper also outlines the exemptions, remissions oroffsetting benefits which will be available; many of them will be increased and extended to more families. In order to ensure that the public are,aware of the: exemptions and benefits concerned the. Government will, give themnew publicity.3. The following tables show the public expenditure programmes for1971-72 and, in outline, for 1974-75 as they would have been on the policies existing before the Governments review and as they will now be.The totals of the new programmes are lower than the previous costingsby about  300 million in 1971-72 and by nearly  1,600 million in 1974-75.Between these years the average annual rate of increase in total public expenditure, which at constant prices would have been 3-6 per cent onthe previous costings, becomes 2 - 7 per cent (excluding investment grants from the comparison throughout).3

They include the estimatesthen made of the cost of the policies set out in the White Paper &quot; Public Expenditure, 1968-69 to 1973-74 &quot;(Cmnd. 4234), and such changes of policy as were made after the White Paper but before the Survey. They representthe position as seen at the beginning of this Parliament.. : (2) The figures in columns (b) and (c) comprise (i) subsequent changes in estimates and (ii) the changes causedby the new policies set out in this White Paper.(3) The main changes in estimates referred to at 2 (i) above are:[ : 1971-72Increases      DecreasesOther military defence : 3  Technology and industry     ...   r-   .Nationalised industries        ... 4-10  Education.............. : 4 -  Social security ...       ...       ... 4-38      &quot;&apos; - -&quot; -    &apos; - -&apos;Debt interest   ... i    ...      ...    .    +20 -. -130 -.:.(4) The established convention for expressing projections of the social security programme is that the figures show the cash cost of the benefits at their existing levels. The additional real cost of any improvements of benefitsthat may be decided upon in the future represents a charge on the contingency reserve.(5) The provision for the relative price effect and other adjustments includes new estimates for the relative price effectrthe adjustment to 1970-71 outturn prices; and the price adjustment for social security benefits (seeCmnd. 4234, Appendix iii, paragraph 9). The decreases take account of the latest estimates of shortfall( 100 million) over the programmes as a whole other than capital expenditure of the nationalised industries(see paragraph 14).(6) All the figures of expenditure in the following paragraphs are at 1970 Survey prices, unless otherwisestated.1974-75Increases      Decreasesr 6 -  &apos;;+30 -4-12 -
THE. PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMES  ,rDefence Budget. - 4. . The \ Long Term Costings for 1971-72 have been reduced by 28 million, to  2,327 million, the equivalent in real terms of the levelforecast in the December 1969 White Paper (Cmnd. 4234)(!). &apos; The Costingsfor 1974-75 have been reduced by  132 million net to a total of 2,300 million. Thus the Government will contain the level of defencespending, while meeting the additional expenditure to be incurred on the uk military contribution to Five-Power defence arrangements inSouth-East Asia, the expansion of the Territorial and Army volunteer reserve, and the other new measures to improve our defence capability setout in1 the Supplementary Statement on Defence which will be presented toParliament by the Secretary of State for Defence.   :Overseas aid     &apos;;5. The economic aid programme, which for 1971-72 will be  245 million in gross cash terms will be maintained at the levels forecast in Cmnd: 4234,rising to  300 million in 1973-74, and there will be a further increase to 340 million in 1974-75. At constant prices and net of repayments of loans,, the total provision for overseas aid, i.e. including items additional tothe economic aid prosramme, will rise from  213 million in 1971-72 to 256 million in 1974-75. -Other overseas services, The fee for a new passport will be raised to&apos; 5. With increases in other related charges arid in consular fees, this will yield additional revenue of  5-6 million in 1971-72 and  6 million a year thereafter.Research Councils, etc.7. Public expenditure combat the Research Councils, etc., will be cut by amounts rising from  2 million in 1971-72 to  5 million in 1974-75. this programme will continue to be reviewed, but as at present envisaged will rise from  115 million in 1971-72 to  129 million in 1974-75.Technology and industry8. The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation will be wound up. Asa result a sum estimated at  20-30 million under the Corporation^ existing statutory limit will remain undrawn; and a liability will be avoided to findup to an estimated  40 million extra a year which would otherwise havebeen incurred in the years ahead.9. The Regional Employment Premium, which is running at a littleover  100 million a year, will be discontinued in September 1974.10. Expenditure on other programmes in the field of technology andindustry will be reduced by  14 million in 1971-72 rising to  65 million in1974-75. In some cases, decreases remain to be worked out in greater detail.   The grant to the British Productivity Council will be phased out(&apos;) &quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1973-74&quot;.6
and that to the Consumer Council discontinued. It has -also been decided not to proceed to set up the new Design Council in present circumstances.The general scheme of grants and loans to hotels will end with the expiry of its life under present legislation but a new limited scheme of assistanceto tourism in the development areas will be. worked out:II: There will be some  13 million additional expenditure over theperiod on Government Training Centres and various other training measures,and on staff required to implement industrial relations legislation. Therewill also be some additional expenditure on other programmes, includingassistance to the coal industry while contracting.Investment grants12. Investment grants will be discontinued except on eligible capitalexpenditure incurred under existing contracts. There will be new provisions to encourage investment through capital allowances with preferential treatment for the development areas. These arrangements are set out indetail in the separate White Paper entitled &quot; Investment Incentives&quot;(Cmnd. 4516). .      * &apos; .Development areas: 13. In conjunction with these arrangements, extended measures ofassistance to industry and for the improvement of infrastructure will beintroduced for the development areas, involving additional public expenditureof some  25 million a year. Details of these measures are also set out in&quot; Investment Incentives &quot;,Nationalised industries14. This programme provides only for the capital1 expenditure of the nationalised industries. The costing of existing policies included provisionfor the acquisition of ports and port businesses. These items areeliminated under the new policies. New estimates of shortfall in theindustries&apos; expenditure have reduced the totals by  25 million in 1971-72and  50 million in 1974-75. The programmes themselves have also beenreduced by  42 million in 1971-72 rising to  73 million in 1974-75.Roads and transport15.   These programmes have been reduced as follows:  million1971-72 1974-75Roads      ...       ...       ...Assistance to nationalised industriesOther transport ...      ...     .......5         2510        158        182358The resulting programmes will rise from  1,024 million in total in 1971-72to  1,182 million in 1974-75.       - ...........7
Miscellaneous local services16. This programme, now costing more than  800 million a year, willbe reduced by  10 million in 1971-72 and 1974-75, for instance by restricting the use of public finance for industrial and commercial development outside development areas.Arts17. An additional  1 million has been made available for this programme for the one year 1971-72. It has been decided that charges should be levied for admission to national museums and galleries. The arrangementsfor these charges will be discussed with the institutions concerned. these charges are expected to yield about  1 million in a full year.EducationSchool meals18. The charge for school meals is at present Is. 9d. which will become9 new pence after decimalisation and will be raised to 12 new pence on1 April 1971 and to 14 new pence on 1 April 1973. The aim is that thecharge should eventually cover the running cost. The gross level of parents&apos;income below which their children are entitled to free meals will be raised for an average family by about 30s. a week in April 1971 rising to about40s a week in April 1973. The estimated net saving from the increased charges, after allowing for the extended entitlement to free meals, is 20 million in 1971-72, rising to  38 million by 1974-75.School milk19. A Bill will be introduced to discontinue the supply of free milk to pupils at the end of the summer term after they reach age 7. Youngerpupils in nursery and primary schools, pupils up to 12 who have a medicalrequirement and pupils in special schools will not be affected. The practicalarrangements will be discussed with local education authorities. In a full year the saving will be about  9 million.Further education fees20. Discussions will also be held with local education authorities inEngland and Wales on increases, from September 1971, in the fees chargedin further education establishments for non-vocational courses and for vocational courses for those already in employment; but it is not intended that there should be any tuition charge for students under 18 attendingfull-time courses.  The aim will be to save  5 million in a full year.Increased primary school building programme21. There will be a substantial increase in school building programmes for 1972-73 to enable local education authorities to make faster progress inreplacing &apos; and improving old primary schools. For Great Britain theprevious programme (see general note (1) on tables 1 and 2, page 5)had allowed ior the start of only  13 million worth of work for improvements in 1972-73w   Instead the new programme for that year will include starts8
for this purpose totalling  44 million of which about  36 million will befor England,  5 million for Scotland and  3 million for Wales. The neteffect will be that expenditure on educational building as a whole duringthe four years to 1974-75 will be increased by  28 million.Health and welfare servicesWelfare milk and health charges22. Cheap welfare milk, which is now subsidised by the taxpayer tothe extent of 6d. a pint, will cease to be available. The present arrangements will continue for free welfare milk for expectant and nursing mothers andchildren under the age of 5 in families which are in need and for the third and subsequent such persons in all families.23. Measures will be introduced as soon as possible to enableprescription charges to be related more closely than now to a proportionof the cost of the individual prescription, with a ceiling to the amount ofthe. charge. Meanwhile, the existing flat rate charge of 2s. 6d. perprescription item will be raised to 4s., the arrangement for, exemptionsremaining unchanged. There will also be increased charges for elastic hosieryand new charges for certain appliances supplied by hospitals.24. Charges for dental services will be related to approximately halfof the cost of the services actually provided, apart from dental examinationswhich will continue to be free of charge. The present exemptions willremain unchanged except that it is proposed in due course to reduce theupper age limit of exemption for young people from 21 to 18.25. The charges for spectacles will be increased so as broadly to includethe cost of dispensing. Eye tests will continue to be free and there willbe no change in the present exemption arrangements.26. These changes will produce gross savings in public expenditure which are&apos; estimated at  71 million in 1971-72, rising, to  88 million in1974-75 composed as follows:The gross income levels for entitlement to free welfare milk and toexemptions and refunds of the new charges will be raised by amounts upto about 30s. a week. This, together with new government publicity forthe entitlements of those with low incomes, will reduce the health and welfare savings by about  3 million a year and will increase supplementary benefit payments by about  4 million a year.27. It is the intention that all the foregoing changes concerning health and welfare services will be brought into effect as soon as the necessarystatutory and administrative arrangements can be completed.  millionWelfare milk......Prescription, etc., chargesDental chargesOphthalmic charges   ...353214788
Additional expenditure28. The government intends to switch part of these savings in public expenditure on the health and welfare services to those parts of the services which are in greatest need. The forward expenditure plans have therefore been adjusted to provide for new expenditure amounting to  110 million over the years 1971-72 to 1974-75. With this provision the Governmentwill further develop the health and welfare services, including hospitalfacilities, particularly for the elderly and mentally handicapped.Social securityFamily poverty29. As an immediate step in tackling family poverty a Bill will beintroduced to provide a new cash benefit for poor families with breadwinnersin full time work.  Payment would starf in August 1971.Unemployment, sickness and injury benefit30. Under the present rules flat rate unemployment, sickness and injurybenefit is paid for the first three days of absence from work if the claimantis unemployed; or sick for a period of twelve days or more. legislation will be introduced to end this entitlement. Supplementary benefit is available for cases of hardship. There will be a saying of about  20 million a year.      * : .Improved benefits - &apos;31. Additional expenditure is also provided for the pensions for peopleover age 80; payment of the new widows&apos; pensions from April, 1971; andfor increased expenditure on remissions of the social service chargesmentioned in paragraphs 18-26 above.Miscellaneous services32. The abolition of the Land Commission will reduce expenditureon the acquisition of land. The reduction in 1971-72 will be  21 million.But since betterment levy has also been abolished there will be some lossof revenue;Northern Ireland       ......33. There will be discussion with the Northern Ireland government about those aspects of the new policies which relate to matters which arethe responsibility of that Government. ^Agricultural subsidies, housing subsidies, and general measures(i) Agriculture: price guarantees. 34. The new system of agricultural support, based on levy arrangements,will reduce the agricultural support bill in due course, but : it is too soon to be precise about the amount of the savings for 1971-72. Inthe longer run substantial savings are expected of the order of  150 million by 1974-75. Increases in food prices will be taken into account in the periodical upratings ; of social security benefits, including supplementary benefits. The new legislation on family benefit (paragraph 29 above) is alsointended to helpliathis respect.     ,v      ; .; : / ,10
(ii) Housing subsidies35. The system of housing subsidies, rents and rebates is to berefashioned, to ensure, instead of the present indiscriminate subsidy system,that more help goes to those who most need, it. A full statement will bemade soon. By the middle of the decade this is expected to lead to a saving in public expenditure of  100-200 million a year by comparisonwith the projection on the basis of the existing system.36. Details of the new policies in these two fields have still to be fullyworked out. Consultations are also involved with overseas governments inthe one case and local authorities in the other. For these reasons the revised provision for these two programmes in both 1971-72 and 1974-75is shown grouped together with an unallocated margin in&apos;the total expenditureplan which provides a contingency reserve.(iii) General measures37. An intensive examination of the functions of central governmentand of their manpower requirements is in progress.(J) The Government expectlocal authorities also to seek to improve their efficiency. The scope of charges in the public services generally, and their alignment with costs where this is appropriate, are being examined. These measures will justifyreductions in due course in the provision for particular programmes, butit is too soon to say by how much in each case. At this stage they represent an offset to calls on the contingency reserve.Contingency reserve38. For the purpose of column (a) of tables 1 and 2 (the previous programmes) the same figures for the contingency reserve have been assumed for 1971-72 and 1974-75 respectively as were given for thecorresponding years (1970-71 and 1973-74) in the White Paper of a yearago (Cmnd. 4234).0) See &quot; The Reorganisation of Central Government&quot;, Cmnd. 4506, Sections &quot;Vand VI.311186  Dd.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery OfficeK      10/70
