THE REORGANISATION OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENTI.   A NEW STYLE OF GOVERNMENT: AIMSThis Administration has pledged itself to introduce a new style ofgovernment. More is involved than bringing forward new policies and programmes: it means resolving the issue of the proper sphere of operationof government in a free society; and improving the efficiency of the machineryintended to achieve the aims it sets itself within that sphere.2. This Administration believes that government has been attempting 10do too much. This has placed an excessive burden on industry, and onthe people of the country as a whole, and has also overloaded the government machine itself. Public administration and management in central governmenthas stood up to these strains, but the weakness has shown itself in theapparatus of policy formulation and in the quality of many government decisions over the last 25 years.3. The Government intend to remedy this situation. The review of govermental functions and organisation which has been carried out overthe last four months is intended to lay the necessary foundations. The aims in that review have been:(i) To improve the quality of policy formulation and decision ingovernment by presenting Ministers, collectively in Cabinet andindividually within their departments, with well-defined options,costed where possible, and relating the choice between options tothe contribution they can make to meet national needs. This is hotconfined to new policies and new decisions, but implies also the continuing examination, on a systematic and critical basis, of theexisting activities of government.(ii) To improve the framework within which public policy is formulated by matching the field of responsibility of government departments tocoherent fields of policy and administration.(iii) To ensure that the government machine responds and adapts to new policies and programmes as these emerge, within the broad framework of the main departmental fields of responsibility.The fulfilment of these aims will improve the efficiency of government.This does not mean an increase in State power, nor any sacrifice of humanityand compassion in public administration. Indeed, the systematicformulation of policy and the presentation to Ministers of defined optionsfor decision provides them with the opportunity for greater openness ingovernment, and more responsiveness to the needs and wishes of thecommunity and of individuals in short, a new and better balance betweenthe individual and the modern State. The Civil Service itself, as it is givenclearer objectives and more sharply defined responsibilities, will find thatthe work of public administration will again become more satisfying andthat relations with the public it serves will improve.  ^4. The Government also recognise that the enhanced degree of efficiency in government which will be achieved raises the issue of the effectiveness of the system of Parliamentary scrutiny. In this context, they intend to publish in the near future a Green Paper setting out their proposals for a revision of the structure of the Select Committee system.311171 a 2
5. This review differs fundamentally both in the depth of its aims andin the breadth of its scope from previous piecemeal changes in the pattern of departmental responsibilities. It has been concerned not merely withdepartmental boundaries but with the central mechanism by which public policy is made and carried out. The results will therefore be longer lastingand will remove the need for continual changes for a considerable period inthe future. The product of this review will be less government, and bettergovernment, carried out by fewer people. Less government, because its activities will be related to a long-term strategy aimed at liberating privateinitiative and placing more responsibility on the individual and less on theState. It^will be better government, because the tasks to be done will bebetter defined and fewer in number, requiring fewer Ministers and fewer civilservants to carry them out.II.   THE REORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT: PRINCIPLES6. To translate these broad aims into applied principles of organisationentails changes both in the, methods of operation within and between government departments and &quot;in departmental organisation.The Analytical Approach7. The basis of improved policy formulation and decision-taking isrigorous analysis of existing and suggested government policies, actions andexpenditure. This analysis must test whether such policies or activities accord with the Governmenfs strategic aims and, indeed, whether they are suitable forgovernment at all. And it must test whether they are of greater or lesserpriority than other policies or activities at present carried out, or likely tobe proposed in the future; what is the most efficient means of execution; andwhether their long-term effects are likely to accord with Governmentpriorities and policies as they develop.The Functional Approach8. Using the same approach to deal with the issue of the organisationof government departments, the object has been to ensure that the broadframework of the central machinery in terms of Ministerial and departmentalfunctions complies with the Governmenfs strategic policy objectives. in practical terms, this means the application of the functional principle as thebasis for the allocation of responsibilities: government departments shouldbe organised by reference to the task to be done or the objective to be attained, and this should be the basis of the division of work between departments rather than, for example, dividing responsibility between departments so that each one deals with a client group.9. The basic argument for this functional principle is that the purposeof organisation is to serve policy. And policy issues which are linked shouldbe grouped together in organisational terms. Furthermore, such grouping ofrelated functions clarifies the lines of demarcation between responsibilities and saves duplication of effort between departments. It achieves economies of scale and avoids: the diffusion of expert knowledge and the difficulty ofco-ordination which organisation by area or by client group would involve.
This grouping of related functions in unified departments has become themore important with the increasing complexity of mbdern society and,therefore, of government.10. The acceptance of the functional principle of organisation does not mean that there can be no departure from it if there are strong reasons formoderating its application. Thus, the functional principle does not invalidatethe existing pattern whereby Scotland and Wales are treated separately. Thatthey should have policy objectives as specific to them as to England isgenerally recognised in a number of fields. But within the Scottish Officeand the Welsh Office the same functional principle for the division of workapplies.The Unification of Functions11. The outcome of the Governments review, in terms of departmental organisation, is set out in paragraphs 18-42 below. The emphasis is on the grouping of functions together in departments with a wide span, so as toprovide a series of fields of unified policy. This continues the trend towardsunification of functions which has evolved in recent years and which may beseen, for example, in the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and commonwealth Office.: 12.   This offers a number of advantages:(i) A capacity within such unified departments to propose andimplement a single strategy for clearly defined and acceptedobjectives.(ii) A capacity to explore and resolve conflicts both in policy formulationand executive decision within the line of management rather thanby inter-departmental compromise.(hi) A capacity to manage and control larger resource-consumingprogrammes, in terms both of formulation and administration,within departmental boundaries, making possible in turn more effective delegation of executive tasks.(iv) The easier application of analytic techniques within large and self-contained blocks of work and expenditure.(v) More direct identification to the community of the Ministers and departments responsible for defined functions, programmes and policies, more open communication between government and thepublic about these and better opportunities to discuss andchallenge them.(vi) A capacity to contribute more effectively to the formulation anddevelopment of the Governments overall strategy.13. But these advantages will be offset if issues which warrantinter-departmental discussion are decided within the new unified departmentswithout such discussion. This places an additional responsibility ondepartments, as well as on those in the central- staffs, to ensure that the collective responsibility of Ministers is not eroded. Indeed, the two issuesgo together. The advantages of the unification of functions set out above are largely aspects of a single concept-the desirability of the comprehensiveapproach in government organisation.   A department unifying a group of
functions will be less open to the risk of being parochial and will, therefore,be more answerable to Parliament and the community at large. Equallyit will have less need to fear for and defend its interests against other interestsso that in the formative stages of policy it must and will be ready to discussissues with other departments. In this way, the full range of facts and issueswill be presented to Ministers for their collective decision.14. The Government recognise that the mere aggregation of functionsinto a series of large departments would lead to problems of managementbecause of the size and complexity of the top organisational apparatus. but these problems will be reduced by defining clearly the boundaries of the functional wings which will make up the large departments and the responsibilities, both Ministerial and official, of those who work in them.There will be a sustained effort to ensure that among those functions which remain a necessary part of central government, executive blocks of workwill be delegated to accountable units of management, thus lessening the load on the departmental top management. These are,&apos; however, major changes and will take some time to bring about. Special attention willalso be paid to the need to create within these large departments asatisfactory organisation for handling career planning and staff management.The Decision-taking Process15. The Government have also considered the machinery for decision-taking at the centre. It is here that changes are necessary to assist ministers in assessing, the relative priorities of departmental programmes and policies.Such changes must be designed to remedy the major difficulty which facesgovernment in a modern complex society, which cannot be solved by goodadministration and management alone. It is the problem of policyformulation and decision-taking: how Ministers can have before them at theright time all the necessary information and the analysis to enable them totake decisions. Thus the necessary basis for good government is a radicalimprovement in the information system available to Ministers.16. To provide this essential basis it is important that there should bea capability at the centre for analysis, and the steps the Government aretaking to improve their machinery for this purpose are set out in paragraphs43-52 below: they mark an important stage in the introduction of techniqueswhich will assist Ministers in taking decisions, with the presentation to them of the information on a basis free from purely departmental considerationsas the essential feature.Stability17. The considerable changes of government organisation outlined belowwill provide a firm basis on which the new techniques and the new approach to government can be applied to questions of policy and administration.The Government do not foresee a further prolonged period of change anddisturbance in the central machinery of government once the remaining issuesoutlined in later paragraphs of this White Paper are resolved. A period of stability is of the highest importance if the machinery and the staff whoconstitute it are to work efficiently and well.&quot; No organisational formremains valid for ever; but the main departmental structures as now outlined
are intended and expected to remain valid for a long time to come. Thefurther review of work by each department referred to in paragraphs 53-54below will be assisted by the structural changes now being introduced.III.   THE CHANGES IN THE ORGANISATION OFGOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS18. The changes in departmental responsibilities involve the re-orderingof responsibility for functions between the departments dealing with tradeand industry, aviation supply, the environment, overseas aid, the personal social services, and education and the urban programme in Wales.Department of Trade and Industry19. At present responsibility for general industrial policy and administration (other than employment and manpower questions, includingindustrial relations) is divided between the Board of Trade and the Ministryof Technology.20.   Unifying this whole field of policy has the following advantages:(i) It avoids an unreal dichotomy between the &quot; internal and&quot; international&quot; aspects of commerce and industry, i.e., between thedepartment responsible for export promotion and overseas commercial policy and the department responsible for the bulk of the government&apos;s relations with industry.(ii) It makes possible an effective strategy for the delegation of executivetasks.(iii) It avoids the division Of responsibility for government relations withpublicly and privately owned enterprises operating in the samesector which would arise if responsibility for nationalised industries and privately owned industry were separated from each other.(iv) It greatly simplifies industry&apos;s contacts with government by ensuring that a single department is responsible over virtually the whole field(except for manpower questions), making possible cleareridentification of responsibilities and better communication.(v) General industrial and commercial services (company law, standards,patents etc.) will be the responsibility of the same department as are the Governmenfs relations with specific industries; and bothmanufacturing industries and service industries will be part of thesame field of responsibility.(vi) The allocation of public resources to industry, both public and private sector, will with few exceptions fall within the responsibilityof a single Minister, making possible both the formulation and theconsistent operation of a single policy. \. -(vii) The unified structure will have advantages in the context of thepossibility of our accession to the European Economic Community.-21. The Government have therefore decided to set up a unifiedDepartment of Trade and Industry.  It will be based on the functions of the
Board of Trade (including the Board&apos;s civil aviation responsibilities) andthe functions of the Ministry of Technology (other than responsibility foraerospace research, development and procurement and for sponsorship ofthe aerospace industry) and also responsibility for government policy towardsmonopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices (transferred from theDepartment of Employment and Productivity). A Secretary of State for trade and Industry is being appointed, who will also hold the historic officeof the President of the Board of Trade. He will be the Minister in charge ofthe new Department and will have final responsibility, including ultimatecontrol of all statutory powers vested in the Department. The office of secretary of State for Employment and Productivity will be renamed Secretaryof State for Employment, with a corresponding change in the title of his department.22. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will be concerned primarily with the strategic issues of policy and priority which determine the operations of his Department as a whole. He will be supported by two ministers, to each of whom he will delegate responsibility for a particularrange of functions. The status (though not the legal position) of the seministers will be equivalent to that of a Minister in charge of a separatedepartment not represented in the Cabinet.23. The objective of the Department of Trade and Industry will beto assist British industry and commerce to improve their economic and technological strength and competitiveness. It is the Departments task toestablish a general framework of requirements, incentives and restraintswithin which firms can operate as freely as possible to their own individualadvantage. This involves creating as favourable an international environmentas possible for British industry, and in particular the provision of greatopportunities for British industry in the negotiations for entering into theEuropean Economic Community. The framework includes the tariff, the constraints on monopolies and mergers and company law; all of these canbe used to encourage efficiency and competition and all will become increasingly important as we become a part of the European economy.24. The Department will also be responsible for: the Governmenfsrelations with the great majority of industries, and will maintain a two-waycontact with them. This responsibility covers both the private sector andthe public sector: in the latter-electricity, gas, coal, atomic energy, steel,airlines,^ airports the Department will also carry the Governmenfsresponsibility for the public interest in these undertakings, as laid down inthe statutes.25. It will be a major function of the new Department, for which special machinery is provided, to review the size and methods of the various servicesnow provided to help industry, in order to determine whether they are a proper charge on the State and if so whether the present system of organisation is cost-effective and likely to : produce the required results orwhether other forms of organisation would carry out these functions more effectively. These services include export promotion services, export credits,a wide range of advisory services notably for small and medium-sized firms,and Government encouragement of industrial research. Related to these isthe Departments responsibility for the industrial aspects of regional policy.
Ministry   of   Aviation   Supply  and   Future  Responsibility   for   DefenceProcurement26. The responsibilities of the Ministry of Technology for aerospaceresearch, development and procurement will not form part of the new department of Trade and Industry. A major part of these responsibilitiesconsists of the procurement of aircraft and similar equipment for defence purposes though all other defence procurement is a function of the Ministryof Defence-but they also have civil aspects, such as responsibility forrelations with the aerospace industry, which are closely interwoven withthe defence aspects. Not only would the inclusion of these responsibilitiesincrease the size, range of functions and degree of heterogeneity of theDepartment of Trade and Industry to an unacceptable extent, but theirdetachment affords an opportunity of rationalising the whole function of defence procurement, and the overlapping aerospace responsibilities,on a lasting basis. This is, however, a task of very great complexityand magnitude. The Government have, therefore, thought it right to announce their broad intentions for the future of this range of responsibilities,and to lay down a timetable and guidelines for their reorganisation.27. As a temporary measure, the Aviation Group of the Ministry of technology will become a separate Ministry of Aviation Supply. Thiswill, for the time being, take over all the aerospace functions of the Ministryof Technology, both civil and military. The Ministry of Aviation supply will have its own Minister, who will have full responsibility for all thecivil aspects of his departments work, but will have the same special responsibility to the Secretary of State for Defence on its defence aspectsas now exists between Technology Ministers and the Defence Secretary.At the same time, a project team is being set up to consider the futureof this whole range of responsibilities, with the following terms of reference:&quot; To make recommendations, in time for new arrangements to be implemented by 1 April 1972, on:(a) How best to organise the integration of all defence research and development and procurement activities, under theresponsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence: among thepossibilities to be considered should be the establishment of an agency within Government.(b) How best to handle, in the light of (a), the Governmentsrelations with the industries concerned, including its responsibilities in support of civil aircraft projects and other civil aerospaceactivities.The project team should pay particular regard to the need to meetessential defence and civil requirements in the most economical and efficient way.&quot;The Government will decide the post-April 1972 organisation of these functions in the light of the project teants report.28. The Government recognise that these temporary measures will involve uncertainty about their future for the staff of the new Ministry, manyof whom have already been affected by numerous changes in recent years.
Their aim is, however, &quot;to put an end to future uncertainty by achieving a lasting solution; and this can only be done as part of an ordered and deliberatechange, decided on after full consideration and consultation.Department of the Environment29. Major changes are required too in those parts of the government machine which deal with the physical environment.30. It is increasingly accepted that maintaining a decent environment,improving people&apos;s living conditions and providing for adequate transport facilities all come together in the planning of development. These are among,the main functions of local authorities and are having an ever-increasingimpact on ordinary people, in town and country and especially in and around the larger urban areas. Because these functions interact, and becausethey give rise to acute and conflicting requirements, a new form of organisation is needed at the centre of the administrative system.31. Accordingly, the Ministries of Housing and Local Government^ ofPublic Building and Works and of Transport will be unified in a single department of the Environment, under a Secretary of State. Except inScotland and Wales, where the Scottish and Welsh Offices will continue toplay the major part, the new Department will be responsible for the whole range of functions which affect people&apos;s living environment. It will cover the planning of land where people live, work, move and enjoy themselves.It will be responsible for the construction industries, including the housing programme, and for the transport industries, including public programmes of support and development for the means of transport. There is a need to associate with these functions responsibility for other major environmentalmatters: the preservation of amenity, the protection of the coast andcountryside, the preservation of historic towns and monuments, and the controlof air, water and noise pollution: all of which must be pursued locally,regionally, nationally and in some cases internationally. And it will have theleading responsibility for regional policy: certain economic aspects,including industrial development in the regions, will remain with theDepartment of Trade and Industry, but the Department of the Environmentwill have important executive powers for the development of regionalinfrastructure and the maintenance of regional services. It will also havethe particular responsibility of ensuring that people&apos;s rights are adequatelyprotected wherever they are affected by the proposals of their neighboursor of public authorities. Local authorities are profoundly involved in these fields arid the new Department will, therefore, carry responsibility at thecentre for the structure and functioning of local government as well as for regional affairs.32. The Secretary of State for the Environment will be in charge of thenew Department and will have final responsibility including all statutory powers. He will be concerned primarily with the strategic issues of policyand priority which determine the operations of the Department as a whole.He will be supported by a Minister for Local Government and Development,a Minister for Housing and Construction and a Minister for transport industries. Each of these Ministers will have, by delegation. from theSecretary of State, full charge of his functional wing of the Department.
The status (though not the legal position) of these Ministers will be equivalentto that of a Minister in charge of a separate department not represented inthe Cabinet. They will have subordinate Ministers working to them withinthe field of policy which falls to each.33. This unification of functions will place central government in abetter position to deal with the reorganisation of local government. this and the issue of regional organisation both raise structural questions ofgreat importance which will require orderly and careful consideration.Overseas Aid34. The Government have reviewed with particular care the future organisation of government in the aid field, against the background ofconsiderable public interest at home and abroad and of the need to engagethe private sector of industry, commerce and finance to a greater extent than hitherto. They have come to the conclusion that, in order to unifyministerial responsibility for overseas policy, overseas aid should become theultimate responsibility of the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs. They recognise, however, that the management of overseas aid is a function distinct from the general conduct of foreignaffairs and that it is important to maintain the valuable body of expertiseand skill in aid administration which has been developed in the Ministryof Overseas Development and its predecessors. The development workof the unified department will therefore be in the charge of a Minister for overseas Development who will have, by delegation from the Secretaryof State, full charge of his functional wing of the Foreign and commonwealth office; his status (though not his legal position) will be equivalent to thatof a Minister in charge of a separate department not represented in theCabinet. The overseas development administration of the Foreign and commonwealth Office will continue, like the Ministry of overseas development, to be staffed by home civil servants (with continuing provisionfor secondments in both directions with the Diplomatic Service).The Personal Social Services35. The integration of the personal social services -welfare, child care and some aspects of health is being effected at local authority level inEngland and Wales by the Local Authority Social Services Act, 1970. Butthis has not so far been matched by unification of Ministerial responsibilityat the centre. The Government believe that the effective development of anew, broadly-based service to deal with family needs in accordance with the objectives of the Seebohm Committee calls for the support, encouragement and guidance of a single Minister. The child care responsibilities of theHome Secretary in England will, therefore, be transferred to the Secretaryof State for Social Services when the main provisions of the 1970 Act comeinto effect on 1 January next. The Secretary of State for Wales will thenassume similar responsibilities in Wales. The Home Secretary will retain,for both England and Wales, his existing responsibilities in relation to the juvenile courts and the problems of juvenile delinquency, since these areintegral to his overriding responsibility for protecting the public and ensuring the rights and liberties of the individual.
Scotland36. The functions of the Scottish Office are not affected by any of the changes set out above. In Scotland, Ministerial responsibility for most ofthe services now assigned to the Department of the Environment is already in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland, as also is responsibility in relation to the local authority personal social services.Wales37. As announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech, responsibility for primary and secondary education in Wales is being transferred to the Secretary of Statefor Wales. Responsibility for child care functions in Wales (seeparagraph 35) is also being transferred to the Secretary of State. Inaddition, administrative arrangements will ensure that in future the welsh office will share in the administration of the urban programme of grants to areas of acute social deprivation, and local authorities in Wales will look tothe Welsh Office on this matter.Legal Aspects38. The appointments of the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industryand for the Environment fake effect at once.39. An Order in Council, subject to negative resolution, giving effectto the new arrangements for the Department of Trade and Industry and thetemporary Ministry of Aviation Supply is to be made on 19 October and will come into effect on 20 October. Provision will also be made to change the name of the Department of Employment and Productivity to theDepartment of Employment.40. The merger of the Ministries of Housing and Local Government,Public Building and Works, and Transport into the Department of the environment, and the transformation of the Ministry of overseas development into a functional wing of the Foreign and commonwealth office, will have to be effected by Orders in Council requiring Parliamentaryauthority. For this purpose, it is intended to lay draft Orders as soon aspossible after the two Houses resume. The posts of Minister of housing and Local Government, Minister of Public Building and Works and minister of Transport, and that of Minister of Overseas Development, willcontinue for the transitional period until Parliamentary authority has beenobtained for the draft Orders and they come into effect.41. The transfer of child care functions from the Home Office to theDepartment of Health and Social Security and to the Welsh Office will be amatter for administrative arrangement. As explained in paragraph 35above, this will take place on 1 January, 1971, when the main provisionsof the Local Authority Services Act, 1970 are Intended to come intooperation.42. The transfer of responsibility for primary and secondary education in Wales will be achieved by an Order subject to negative resolution cominginto effect on 5 November. The administrative arrangements for ensuring that the Welsh Office share in the administration of the urban programme in Wales take effect at once.
IV.  COLLECTIVE ORGANISATION FOR POLICY-MAKING43. The Government also intend to improve, in relation both to theirstrategy as a whole and to their policies for public expenditure, the methods by which collective policy decisions are currently taken.Definition of Government Strategy44. The existing system of inter-departmental committees is designedto maintain the collective responsibility of Ministers for the governments policies in each of the main sectors of governmental concern, by bringing together the differing views of Ministers and ensuring that the final decisionscommand the agreement of the Cabinet as a whole. For this purpose thesystem works well; and it is capable of continuous modification to meetthe increasingly complex and technical character of the processes ofgovernment and administration in modern society.45. In recent years, however, it has become clear: that the structure of inter-departmental committees, each concerned with a separate area ofpolicy, needs to be reinforced by a clear and comprehensive definition ofgovernment strategy which can be systematically developed to take accountof changing circumstances and can provide a framework within which theGovernments policies as a whole may be more effectively formulated. for lack of such a clear definition of strategic purpose and under the pressuresof the day to day problems immediately before them, governments are alwaysat some risk of losing sight of the need to consider the totality of their current policies in relation to their longer term objectives; and they may paytoo little attention to the difficult, but critical, task of evaluating as objectivelyas possible the alternative policy options and priorities open to them.46. The Government recognise that the task of producing a strategicdefinition of objectives, in the sense described above, is a new and formidableone and can only be approached gradually. They therefore propose to begin by estabhshing a small multi-disciplinary central policy review staff in theCabinet Office.47. This staff will form an integral element of the Cabinet Office and,like the Secretariat, will be at the disposal of the Government as a whole.Under the supervision of the Prime Minister, it will work for ministers collectively; and its task will be to enable them to take better policy decisions by assisting them to work out the implications of their basic strategy interms of policies in specific areas, to establish the relative priorities to begiven to the different sectors of their programme as a whole, to identifythose areas of policy in which new choices can be exercised and to ensurethat the underlying implications of alternative courses of action are fullyanalysed and considered.48. The new staff will not duplicate or replace the analytical work doneby departments in their own areas of responsibility. But it will seek to enlist their co-operation in its task of relating individual departmentalpolicies to the Governments strategy as a whole:&quot; It will therefore play an important part in the extended public expenditure survey process described below, and it will also be available to promote studies in depth of inter-departmental issues which are of particular importance in relation to thecontrol and development of the Governments strategic objectives.
Analysis of Public Expenditure Programmes49. The most important feature in the planning and control of public expenditure has been the development of the detailed and comprehensiveannual Public Expenditure Surveys, linked with the medium-term economicassessments. Through these surveys, a rational and systematic basis hasbeen developed for the broad allocation of resources to the public sector,and for.detailed allocation to its component parts. The resulting system is a powerful instrument of demand management and financial control.It provides one of the basic elements in the information Ministers need toenable them to balance the claims of competing blocks of public expenditure.50. However, there are two important respects in which it does not provide all the information that is needed for this purpose. It does not call for explicit statements of the objectives of expenditure in a way that wouldenable a Ministers plans to be tested against general government strategy:nor can it regularly embody detailed analysis of existing programmes and of major policy options on them. Much work has been undertaken in specialad hoc policy reviews and in long-term studies, but it has become increasingly clear that the public expenditure survey system should be furtherstrengthened.51. The team of businessmen based in the Civil Service department are well advanced in developing a system for regular reviews which wouldprovide more and better information. These reviews would be a naturalextension of the public expenditure survey system and would supportpresent departmental submissions in the public expenditure survey cycle.They would be designed to provide Ministers with an opportunity to identifyand discuss alternative policy options which can then be explored in greaterdepth before final decisions are taken on the expenditure programmes.52. The nature and timing of the reviews will require careful discussion between departments, as will the exact processes by which they are studied,related to one another and brought into practical effect when decisions are taken on the public expenditure programme as a whole. However, theywill certainly involve a greater emphasis on the definition of objectives and the expressing of programmes so far as possible in output terms;and the presentation and examination of alternative programmes will beof great importance.V.   NEW INITIATIVESReview of Departmental Tasks53. The broad structure of departments having been established,it is necessary to ensure that all the functions and activities that theyare now carrying out are appropriate to the role of central government.In the case of the newly formed departments described above, there organisation provides an especially good opportunity for such are-examination. But the examination is not confined to these; every minister is reviewing the whole range of his existing responsibilities so that theGovernment can decide whether they are. necessary functions of central
government and, if they are confirmed as necessary, whether they are rightlyarticulated in the departments organisational framework. Emphasis will beplaced on ensuring that wherever possible, at all levels, responsibility andaccountability are clearly defined and allocated. The possibilities of stoppingactivities altogether, of reducing them and of transferring them to the private sector will all be explored.54. If there are anachronisms, if there are functions that no longercorrespond to the needs of the 1970s, if there are points at which thestatus quo differs from the Governmenfs view of the priorities, they shouldbe revealed in this review. Every activity, from the most traditional to themost recent innovation, will be subjected to the same rigorous tests: is itrelevant? and does it have to be done by central government? changes that follow from the review will no doubt lead to savings in manpower and money, but the primary purpose is to reduce and rationalise the functionsof government.Location of Government Work55. The reorganisation and unification of departmental responsibilitiesoutlined above provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at the location of government work, and in particular at the possibilities of dispersing more of it from London. The Government are concerned at the increase overthe years in the number of civil servants working in Central London andby the congestion and pressure on accommodation to which this has led.While something approaching a third of all government headquarters work is now conducted outside London, the staff employed in London hasnevertheless increased at about the same rate as the Civil Service as a whole.The Governmenfs determination to secure a contraction in governmentalactivities and, therefore, in the total number of civil servants will contribute towards a solution of this problem; but it is clear that a continuing policyof dispersing government work from London must be a major factor.56. The Government intend to approach this on a systematic basis.The first objective is to establish which Civil Service staff in Central Londonhave an unavoidable need to be there; and to locate other staff outside london with due regard to considerations of economy and efficiency, and of regional policy. The secondary objective is to study the location of those staff whoare to remain in Central London with a view to improving the workingefficiency of departments, and setting to rights some of the fragmentation of offices across London which has been brought about by the pressure onaccommodation.57. The Government have decided to commission a study to determinewith some precision which blocks of work need to remain in London andwhich might most sensibly be relocated outside. Helped by a computermodel developed by the Civil Service Department, this study will also consider the most suitable locations for dispersed work, bearing in mind the working patterns within and between departments.
