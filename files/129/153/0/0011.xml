DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 86 COPY NO 5614 October 1970CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE j SITUATION report note by the Chief Secretary, treasury the Annexes to this note summarise the reductions and increases in public expenditure agreed by the Cabinet up to 14 October.The totals are :-  million at 1970 Survey Prices1971-72 1974-75Reductions  (Annex A) 382 c. 1100^Increases    (Annex B) 76 185Net reductions 306 say 9209 The approximation is due to the saving on housing rentsbeing expressed at current prices.IThe Cabinet have still to consider policy on investment incentives andon additional expenditure in the development areas.2.     The figures are arranged in the Annexes to suit the way inwhich the Cabinet have operated.    This is not the form in which theywould be presented publicly, which is shown in the tables in the draft white Paper (CP(70) 84) (the same tables were earlier circulatedseparately under CP(70) 81).    The praeise reconciliation between thefigures in these two presentations is a matter of great detail, all ofwhich is available to Departments; the main points are these:-i.       In Cabinet the search has been for the means toreduce taxation, and the contrast has been between the programmes assumed in assessing the future tevel oftaxation and those allowed by our target for reducing it.For public presentation, however, we are entitled to addinto the baseline what we should hever have contemplateddoing, but which our predecessors said they would have done.Thus the &quot;previous programmes&quot; in the tables for the draft white Paper include the provision for nationalising the ports and continuing the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation.
ii.       Similarly, the White Paper tables do not count asincreases additional expenditures which our predecessorssaid they would incur and which we are incurring: forinstance, they had provided for scaled-down pensions to widows from April 1972, so that the expenditure on this account for 1974-75 is not an increase on the previous plans)on the other hand, the White Paper table can and does give us the credit for incurring this additional expenditure a yearearlier, for 1971-72.iii. Still on the same approach, the White Paperpresentation enables credit to be taken for meeting greaterdefence commitments at relatively lower cost.iv. The reductions in social security expenditure below what they would have been if the upratings had been in line with the movement of earnings, which represent a largeelement in Annex A to this note, are reflected in the white paper tables by providing contingency reserves correspondinglysmaller   than they would otherwise have needed to be.    the savings are none the less real, though, of course, they arepurposely not made apparent in the White Paper presentation.Even so the contingency reserve for 1974-75 will need toproduce nearly  200 million for the upratings on the policies which we have adopted, and unless the savings, particularly from housing rents and agriculture, exceed our present broadestimates we are not likely to have much more than about 250 million in the reserve for all other purposes.v. The White Paper tables reflect not only the policyreductions and increases which we have agreed, but alsoa number of changes in the costings of certain programmes,and in the estimated outturn of total expenditures, whichhave been made since the original report which officials madeto us last June.M V treasury Chambers, SWT14 October 19702
