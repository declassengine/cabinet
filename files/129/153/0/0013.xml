DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 88 COPY NO     g g15 October 1970CABINETSE LEC T COMMIT TEESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council, I am under promise to put forward, when the House returns afterthe Summer Recess, proposals on the future of the Select Committeesystem.    I now submit for the consideration of my colleagues a draftGreen Paper prepared for this purpose, which has been approved by the ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure,    I am anxious to publish this as soon a6 possible with a view to an early debate in the House.2, This Green Paper is, as I see it, very much a document addressedto the House of Commons,    This makes it possible to take a great deal for granted and to avoid discussion of the underlying constitutional issues whichwould almost certainly arouse controversy.    The draft therefore does no more than summarise briefly the history of the Specialist select committees, set out the proposals made by the Select Committeeon Procedure for turning the Estimates Committee into an expenditure committee and make tentative proposals for the future.    It v/ill no doubt be thought very meagre by academic students of the constitution, but I am not greatly concerned about that if this approach will help to keep the temperature down,3.        Paragraphs 16 onwards set out proposals for the future and itis to these that I would particularly draw attention.    What is suggestedis in substance partial implementation of the recommendations of theProcedure Committee coupled with retention of the best of the SpecialistCommittees,    The Estimates Commritet would be transformed into an expenditure Committee able to consider the projections of public expenditure, but with a membership limited to about 45,    This wouldmake it possible to retain the Select Committees on Science and Technology,Race Relations and Immigration and Scottish Affairs for the duration ofthis Parliament, while reducing the total number of Members employed.I am confident that these proposals will be generally acceptable; but should the debate prove otherwise, the Government will not be committed to them.

(confidential)draft green paperselect committees op the house op commonsIIntroductoryThis memorandum sets out the results of the Government&apos;s review of the specialist Select Committee experiment and of the recommendations made by theSelect Committee on Procedure   for transforming the Estimates Committee into ; ,a Select Committee on Expenditure.   It makes  proposals   for thefuture Select Committee structure which it is intended should serve   as thej    basis for an early debate in the House.2.    The House of Commons has long made use of Select Committees to assist itin exercising its function of scrutinising the acts of the Executive.   ACommittee of Public Accounts was first appointed as far back as 1861, and became a permanent feature of the House&apos;s machinery in the following year; theEstimates Committee was first set up in 1912, though it remained on a sessionalbasis until i960.   But both these &quot;Committees are part of the House&apos;s apparatusof financial control.   The use of Select Committees as regular instruments ofscrutiny in other fields, as distinct from Select Committees appointed to enquire into particular matters, may be said to start with the setting up in1955 of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, as a means of retaining a measure of public accountability without impairing the freedom ofthe industries in matters of day-to-day management.The Specialist Select Committees3.    In 1965 the Select Committee on Procedure recommended the setting up, asa development of the Estimates Committee, of a new Select Committee, &quot;to examinehow the Departments of State carry out their responsibilities and to consider their Estimates of Expenditure and Reports&quot;, which would function through a3eries of Sub-Committees specialising in different fields of governmentalactivity.   This advice was not accepted by the House, although in the following two sessions the Estimates Committee did develop its inquiries to some extent on the lines proposed.   The next positive step forward came in December 1966&quot;hen the then Leader of the House of Commons, Mr Richard Croasman proposed theappointment of two Select Committees, one to consider    Science and Technology(confidential)
(confidential)and the other to consider the activities in England and Wales of the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.   These were the first of the so-calledSpecialist Select Committees and their appointment established the distinctionwhich has since persisted between &quot;subject&quot; Committees, by which is meant those set up to consider a subject or range of subjects, and &quot;departmental&quot; Committees,which are those set up to consider the activities of a particular Departmentof State.V.    The Select Committee on Science and Technology was reappointed session by3ession until the dissolution of the Parliament.   The Select Committee on agriculture, however, after being reappointed for the session 1967/68, was brought to an end in February 1969 and its place taken by a Committee appointedto consider the activities of the Department of Education and Science and theScottish Education Department.   In November 1968 an additional &quot;subject&quot;Committee was set up to consider the operation of the Race Relations Act 1968and the admission of immigrants to the United Kingdom, followed in February 1969by a Committee to consider Scottish Affairs.   Finally in April 1969 a Committeewas appointed to consider the activities of the Ministry of Overseas Development.These last four Committees were all reappointed for the session 1969/70.5.    In all therefore six Specialist Select Committees were appointed; three&quot;subject&quot; Committees, to consider Science and Technology, Race Relations and immigration, and Scottish Affairs, and three &quot;departmental&quot; Committees, investi-gating the Ministries responsible for Agriculture, Education and Science and overseas Aid.   All except the Select Committee on Agriculture were still activewhen the last Parliament was dissolved.   A list of the reports published bythe Committees and by the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries is givenin Appendix A.6.    At the end of the 1966/70 Parliament the Specialist Select Committees variedin size between thirteen and eighteen members, drawn from both sides of theHouse, while the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries had eighteen.Their combined membership of ninety-five compares with a total membership ofall Standing Committees and Select Committees of the House of 530, though it mustbe remembered that a considerable number of Members served on more than oneCommittee.   The increasing demands on the time of Members made by Select2(confidential)
(confidential)Committee work generally can be seen from the rise in the number of sittingscf such Committees and their Sub-Committees.   In 1966, before the SpecialistCommittees began work, there were if04 sittings, compared with only 240 in1964; in 1967 there were W? sittings, in 1968 555 and in 1969 629 sittings.and records and to appoint Sub-Committees.   For the most part they were left todevelop their own methods of working and within their terms of reference to choose the subjects for inquiry, although the subject of future measures against oil pollution was specifically remitted to the Select Committee on science and Technology for consideration by Resolution of the House inApril 1967.   Overlap between inquiries was kept to the minimum by informalliaison between the chairmen of the Specialist Committees and those of thePublic Accounts and Estimates Committees.   Two aspects of the Committees&apos;practice are particularly worthy of note.   The first is that the Committeesand their Sub-Committees commonly took evidence in public, both at Westminsterand locally.   The second is that, following the precedent of the Select Committeeon Nationalised Industries, they on a number of occasions took evidence fromMinisters; during the 1968/69 Session Ministers gave evidence on fourteenoccasions, compared with 170 appearances by Departmental witnesses.   Most ofthe Committees preferred to concentrate their inquiries on. one subject at atime even though a number of Sub-Committees might be set up to considerdifferent aspects of it; but the Committee on Science and Technology operatedthrough four Sub-Committees each studying a separate subject.   On a number of occasions the Committees, like the Estimates Committee before them, employedspecialist technical and professional advisers to supplement the assistance givenby the Department of the Clerk of the House.The proposals of the Select Committee on Procedure8.    In a Special Report to the House in December 1968 the Select Committeeon Procedure announced their decision to make further enquiries into themethods of examination and control by the House of Commons of public expenditure and of the choice of priorities in the planning of it.   The result of theirenquiries was the first Report from the Committee for the Session 1968/69 whichwas ordered to be printed in July 1969*7.    The Specialist Committees were given power to send for persons, papers3
(confidential)9.    The Committee recommended that the Estimates Committee should be changed to a Select Committee on Expenditure, whose Order of reference should be -&quot;^0 consider public expenditure and to examine the form of the papers relatingto public expenditure presented to this House&quot;.   The new Committee should havea General Sub-Committee of sixteen members (some of whom would also be membersof the functional Sub-Committtees) and eight further Sub-Committees (each of nine members) which would be neither &quot;subject&quot; nor &quot;departmental&quot; but &quot;functional&quot;,and which would have the following Order of reference -&quot;To consider the activities of Departments of State concerned with ....(naming a functional field of administration) and the Estimates of their expenditure presented to this House; and to examine the efficiency withwhich they are administered.&quot;It was suggested that subjects might be allocated to the eight Sub-Committees onthe following pattern -Industry, Technology, Manpower and Employment;Power, Transport and Communications;Trade and Agriculture;Education, Science and the Arts;-Housing, Health and Welfare;Law, Order and Public Safety;External attack &amp;irs.10.  The role of the General Sub-Committee would be to scrutinise theprojections of public sector expenditure as a whole after the annual debate on the Expenditure White Paper and to consider the adequacy of the materialprovided and to give an account to the House of the work of Sub-Committees.It 7/ould guide the work of the Committees as a whole and co-ordinate the enquiriesundertaken with the work of other Select Committees.   The tasks of eachfunctional Sub-Committee would be threefold -ia.     It should, first, study the expenditure projections for the department or Departments in its field,, compare them with those of previous years,and report on any major variations or important changes of policy and onthe progress made by the Departments towards clarifying their generalobjectivies and priorities.     defence;
(confidential)b. It should examine in as much detail as possible the implications interns of public expenditure of the policy objectives chosen by ministers and a3se33 the success of the Departments in attaining them.c. It should enquire, on the lines of the present Estimates Sub-Committees,into departmental administration, including the effectiveness of management.11.  The Committee recommended that the Public Accounts Committee and theSelect Committee on Nationalised Industries should.be retained and shouldcontinue to exercise their present function.   They recommended that the house should decide on the future of the Specialist Select Committees in the lightof their Report and as the occasion arose.\5
(confidential)The Achievement of the Specialist Committees12.   Some assessment of what the Specialist Committees have achieved isnecessary as a preliminary to considering what should be done for the future.This is not to pass judgment on the work of individual Committees, but rather to ask whether this form of Parliamentary scrutiny has been so farjustified by results as to warrant its continuance and whether there are any changes which experience suggests to &quot;be desirable.   It must be borne inmind that it is less than 4 years since the first of the Committees wasappointed;   given the novelty of the task it was not to be expected that thefull potential of this form of proceeding could be realised in so short aperiod.   The promise which the Committees hold for the future is thereforeat least as significant as what they have already achieved.13.   Considering first the contribution which the Committees have made to thefunctioniig of the House, it must be conceded that when - too rarely - their reports have been debated, the degree of interest shown by other Members hassometimes been disappointingly small.   This may suggest that the House has yet to learn how to make the most of its Committees - 4 years is a very short period in the history of Parliamentary institutions - but it is no  test oftheir usefulness.   The indirect contribution which the Committees have madeto the quality of debate and of Questions by making Members better informedcannot be measured, but it is beyond dispute that they have acquired a growingbody of expertise and have brought together in their reports, for the benefitof  the House and the public generally, a valuable body of fact and opinion on some important issues.   Further than that the Committees have, in the courseof their enquiries, opened up new channels of communication between parliament and interested bodies and individuals throughout the country.   To take an example, the Select Committee on Science and Technology took evidence froma wide variety of people and representative bodies including GovernmentDepartments, nationalised boards, public corporations, public companies,learned societies, universities and the Confederation of British Industry;they met representatives of local authorities and of the Services, andothers directly concerned.   Members of the Committee travelled in Europe andthe United States of America, and visited many places in the United kingdom in order to make on the spot assessments.6(confidential)
(confidential)14,   It is as yet too soon to assess the contribution which the committees have made to the formation of outside opinion and their influence on government policy.   But there is no doubt that reports of Committees haveattracted widespread publicity in the Press and other media and have donemuch to stimulate discussion of current problems.   The influence of theCommittees on the formation of new policies is more subtle and in manycases will not be visible for some time to come.15,   This represents a considerable achievement, the more so when account istaken of the difficulties under which the Committees have laboured,   Newinstitutions of this sort need time to find the most appropriate style andthe Committees have been hampered in the planning of their work by the factthat they were appointed only for a session at a time and did not know what their expectation of life was.   In some cases also, particularly in the case ofmore  technical inquiries, the work of Committees has suffered from shortage of supporting staff.Proposals for the Futurelb.   The choice would seem to lie in effect between accepting the fullrecommendations of the Select Committee on Procedure;   retaining and developing the system of Specialist Committees along with the SelectCommittee on nationalised Industries;   and some course intermediate betweenthe two.   Although the Select Committee on Procedure recommended the retentionof the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries and expressed no view onthe future of the Specialist Committees, the Government believe that these committees could not continue to exist as they are now alongside the proposedcomprehensive Expenditure Committee because the combined demand on the timeof Members would be much too heavy and the overlap between their fields of inquiry too great,17.   The Select Committee on Procedure made no recommendation as to the precise strength of the proposed Expenditure Committee, but assuming thatno member served on more than one functional Sub-Committee and that halfthe members of the General Sub-Committee sat on a functional Sub-Committee,7(confidential)
(confidential)a total of some 80 members would be required, compared with the 33 of theEstimates Committee.     Attention has already been drawn in paragraph 6 to the growing demands made by Committee work on Members in recent years;   and thereis a danger that this will have an adverse effect on the proceedings in theChamber itself, which must remain the centre of Parliament.     In theGovernment1 s view therefore the burden should not be further increased andefforts 3hould be made to reduce it.     The overlap in subject matter would be most severe between the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries and theproposed Sub-Committee on Power, Transport and Communications, which could hardly avoid being largely concerned with the activities of nationalised industries;   but there would also be less serious overlaps between the specialist Committees and other of the functional Sub-Committees.    No liaisonarrangements, however effective, could produce a satisfactory answer to this problem,18,   The recommendations of the Select Committee on Procedure would providea clean cut and comprehensive solution and avoid any repetition of thedifficulties associated in the past with the setting up and standing down of specialist Committees.    There is certainly a need to reorient the work of theEstimates Committee to take account of the 5 year projections of public expenditure in the White Paper and some strengthening of the Committee would benecessary to enable it to discharge this responsibility adequately.     but although almost all policies find expression in expenditure at some point, itdoes not follow that their examination is always best approached from thisangle;   under such a system subjects with small expenditure implications maynot receive the attention that they deserve.    Moreover the functionalstructure of Sub-Committees proposed by the Select Committee on Procedurecould not well provide for the consideration of subjects such as scottish affairs and Race Relations which cut across this whole basis of classification.And a Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, able to range over the wholeof their activities, would seem a more effective instrument for scrutinisingthe public corporations than Sub-Committees, of an Expenditure Committee, whichwould be directly concerned only with the corporations&apos; capital investment,it also  better reflects the constitutional relationship   between theindustries and Ministers.8(confidential)
(confidential)19.   These considerations suggest that there would be advantage in a dualsystem which provided for the retention of the Select Committee on nationalised Industries and some Specialist Select Committees alongside anEstimates Committee somewhat enlarged in numbers and transformed into an expenditure Committee.     It appears to be the general view that &quot;subject&quot;Committees are to be preferred to &quot;departmental&quot;, because their inquiriesare not inhibited by the artificial limits of departmental responsibility.Moreover both education and overseas aid involve substantial public expenditure and could effectively be studied by the new expenditure committee.     The Government therefore recommend that the Committees whichhave been considering the activities of the Education Departments and theMinistry of Overseas Development should be reappointed on a strictly limitedbasis to complete their unfinished enquiries, but should not form part ofthe new structure of Select Committees.    The Estimates Committee would berestyled the Expenditure Committee, with suitable amended terms of reference and a membership of, say 45*     These changes would enable the Committee tofocus its attention on public expenditure rather than on the SupplyEstimates and to examine a wider selection of the issues arising in this field.     Because the new Committee, unlike the Estimates Committee, wouldnot be barred from considering the policies behind the figures, there wouldbe occasions when it would be appropriate for Ministers to give evidence before it, as they have before the Specialist Select Committees.20.   The new Expenditure Committee should presumably have the samepermanent status under the Standing Orders of the House as the estimates committee now enjoys;   but it would introduce an undesirable rigidity intostructure to afford the same status to the Specialist Committees.     It is,however, important for the effective working of the Committees that theyshould know over what period to plan their work and the Government would propose to make clear on moving for their first appointment that theyenvisaged the Committees on Science and Technology, on Race relations and Immigration and on Scottish Affairs as continuing for the remainder ofthis Parliament, subject in the case of the last named to any reconsiderationmade necessary by constitutional developments.9
(confidential)21,   In the last Parliament the work of the various Select Committees \r:*sco-ordinated by an unofficial liaison group composed of the Chnirmen of theCommittees, presided over by the Chairman of the Public -Accounts Committee.The group also played a valuable role as a link between the Government andSelect Committees generally as well as providing a forum for discussion of matters of common concern to oelect Committees and the Government believe itshould continue,22.   The proposals outlined in this memorandum ore concerned with select committees of the House of Commons only.     But there is also scope in the government&apos;s view for making   more use of Joint Committees of the two houses of Parliament to consider matters which, are not controversial in the party political sense;   such Committees might facilitate the progress of law reformBills,     The Government are considering proposals for this purpose.conclusion%   A system of Select Committees on the lines set out in the foregoingparagrarihs, co-ordinated by the proposed Official Group of Chairmen of committees, would in the Governmenfs view provide an effective machinery ofscrutiny without in any way impairing the responsibility of Ministers toParliament or detracting from the importance of proceedings on the Floor ofthe House,     The proposed system would be flexible and capable of readyadaptation to changing needs and would represent an important development inthe structure of Select Committees,     It would provide for the increasedscrutiny by Parliament of the longer-term projections of public expenditure which the Select Committee on Procedure saw to be desirable, while buildingon the foundations laid   in the last Parliament by the Specialist Committees,The House would have the opportunity of watching the Expenditure and specialist Committees in operation side by side and at a later stage would beable to decide in the light of practical experience whether to deploy more of its Select Committee resources in the one direction or the other.10confidential
(confidential)24.   Any system of Select Committees must make additional work for ministers, their Departments and, of course, for Select Committee membersthemselves.     It increases the pressure on the parliamentary timetable andthe risk of controversy over the proper limits to the confidentiality ofthe decision-making process.     But this is the inevitable price to bo paid for the significant strengthening of the parliamentary system to which theproposals in this paper are addressed.\11
