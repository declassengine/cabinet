DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government cp(70) 99 COPY NO       5830 Ostober 1970CABINETVALUE-ADDED TAXMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.     Tax reforms.    As our Election Manifesto made clear, a majorreform of the tax system is a central feature of the government&apos;s policy.    One of the main aims is to make a substantial reduction in theburden of personal taxation and a start has been made with the reductionin the standard rate of income tax which I announced on 27 October.    Inaddition, it is desirable to reform the structure of indirect taxation and,indeed, essential if we are to honour our pledge to abolish the selective employment Tax (SET).2.     Decision to introduce a Value-Added Tax (VAT).   In our election manifesto we stated;-.&quot;We will abolish the Selective Employment Tax, as part of a wider reform of indirect taxation possibly involving the replacement of purchase tax by a value-added tax. &quot;There were two elements to this: a clear commitment to abolish SET,and a wider reform of indirect taxation in which the introduction of a VATwas mentioned as a possibility.    After much consideration I have concluded that the introduction of a VAT, with the abolition of SET and purchase tax, is the most satisfactory way of carrying out the necessaryreform of indirect taxation.    Indeed, I have come to the conclusion that itis the only way in which we can honour in full our pledge to abolish SET.VAT has the advantage that it can be applied to both goods and services, in contrast to purchase tax which is essentially a tax on goods j VAT is bynature a comprehensive tax and it does not distort the consumer&apos;s pattern of expenditure; at the same time it can, if necessary, be adapted topermit reliefs (though these will need to be limited to a small number of vital areas e. g. food); and VAT is the system of turnover taxation whichMember States of the European Economic Community (e.c.) are requiredto adopt, so that, if our application to join the Common Market succeeds,we shall in any case have to have a VAT.    As it applies over a very widebase VAT has the capacity to raise sufficient revenue to replacepurchase tax and SET and this is the reform which I propose we should introduce.15 m C* Ri EE It11
3.     Of equal importance is the fact that if extra revenue were required beyond that needed to replace purchase tax and SET, forexample to facilitate a further reduction in direct taxation by making a significant switch from direct to indirect taxes, the revenue raisingpotential of VAT is very great and would enable this to be done.    Theextent of such a switch would, of course, depend on the demand situation at the time and the extent to which it was decided to reduce the burden of direct taxation.    This, of course, is not a matter for consideration now.4.     Green Paper.    I am not enamoured of too many Green Papers,but I am sure that, in this case, there should be one to facilitate discussion and the work of preparation.    A copy of the proposed Green Paper isattached.    It explains the main features of VAT, points to some of the major problems in particular areas and invites consultation on the detailed operation of the tax.5.     Revenue from VAT.    The revenue which a VAT would producedepends on the exact coverage of the tax and on the rate or rates of taxadopted.   No firm figures of likely yield can be given until decisions are taken on these questions and in particular on what classes of goods,services or persons would be relieved of VAT.    The draft Green Paperattached to this note indicates the main areas where special provisionmight be made.    I will report orally on the options concerning rates andyields, and the consequences for the cost of living.6.     Administrative cost.    A VAT scheme on the lines envisaged inthe Green Paper would require a net increase (after abolishing purchase tax and SET) of some 5,400 to 5,900 in civil service staff.    There is however a prospect of a major simplification of PAYE resulting insavings of staff, after the mid-1970&apos;s, at least as great as this or possibly greater.    On reasonable assumptions about rates and yieldsthe cost of collection might be about 1. 4 per cent of the revenue.    Thisis somewhat above the average percentage cost of collection of allCentral Government revenue, but no more than that of the Inland Revenueservice.7.     Work involved in the introduction of VAT.    The introduction ofVAT will be a major operation.    It will apply to all goods and services(except where reliefs are granted), to raw materials, semi-manufactures,finished products, to consumer goods and capital goods, to commercialservices and to consumer services, and so on.    (The operation of theVAT is such, however, that the ultimate burden of the tax falls onconsumers&apos; expenditure on goods and services.)   I do not intend to launchsuch a wide-ranging tax without proper consultation with those affected;the lack of adequate consultation was one of our objections to the intro-duction of major tax changes by the previous Government.    consultations with trade and industry will therefore be held so that the tax can be builton firm foundations, taking into account the practical problems ofparticular sectors of the economy.    In the light of these consultations themanifold details of the coverage and operation of the tax will be settled
and the necessary legislation drafted.    A major Bill will be required earlyin the 1971-72 Session.    When this becomes law it will be necessary beforethe tax is introduced to mount a large-scale exercise involving the registration of all traders affected and their education in the details of thenew law and its requirements,    A large computer installation will haveto be designed and accommodated.8.     Need for early announcement of VAT decisions.    The wholeprocess of introducing a VAT is bound to take considerable time - most members of the e.c. took several years.    It is important, however, thatwe should complete the process in the shortest possible time - first topermit the associated abolition of SET and reduction in direct taxes to bemade as soon as possible, and secondly because a VAT whatever itsultimate benefits, is bound to give rise to some criticisms from those affected by its requirements, and it would be desirable to get that phaseover earlier rather than later in the life of this Parliament.9.     After discussion with the Customs and Excise I have persuadedthem to cut the timetable to the bare minimum.    The time required for preparation, including the passage of legislation, is two years, and if mycolleagues agree in principle, it is therefore necessary to launch theprocess of introducing the VAT as a matter of urgency.    This requires anearly announcement of the decision in principle to introduce it, so that thediscussions with trade and industry can begin.    My intention is to makethe announcement in the House before the end of the month.A treasury Chambers, SWl30  October 19703

GREEK PAPER:    VATFOREWORDThe Government is committed to undertake, during the life ofthis Parliament, a major reform of the taxation system that will include the abolition of the selective employment tax and a radical simplification of a tax sj^stem which has &quot;been allowed tobecome too complex and discriminatory.   An important contributionto the achievement of these objectives would be secured by the replacement of the present system of indirect taxation by a morebroadly-based structure ure which, by discriminating less between different types of goods and services, would reduce the distortionof consumer choice.The replacement of the present purchase tax and the selective,employment tax by a broad-based value-added tax was therefore a clear candidate for inclusion in the Government&apos;s tax reformprogramme.    Such a changeover would spread the burden of indirect taxation in a more equitable fashion.The Government has now decided to do this, and the necessarydetailed preparations have been put in hand.    Legislation willbe required in due course.   It is clearly necessary that thenature of the tax should be widely understood and that itsdetails should be the subject of public debate, so that the final decisions can be taken against the background of an informedpublic opinion.   This Green Paper is published to provide a basis for such general public debate.
The-Green Paper is also intended to give trade and professionalassociations and other interested parties an opportunity toconsider and comment on those-aspects of the value-added tax thatwill particularly affect them.
omf1demtial)VAT   . &apos; .CHAPTER. 1   - introduction.1    The existing pattern of indirect taxation in this country is open to the objection that it is selective and is based on toonarrow a range of expenditure.      Selective taxation gives.rise todistortion of trade and of personal consumption patterns, and canlead to the inefficient allocation of resources.      To remedy thisshortcoming in our system, we have to extend the coverage ofexisting taxes or to introduce some new form of tax.     Existingtaxes do not readily lend themselves to extension.      The customs and Excise duties on tobacco, hydrocarbon oil and alcoholic drinkare specific to these products and cannot be extended.     a significant proportion of indirect tax revenue is raised by the selective employment-tax, which the Government is pledged to abolish.      The remaining indirect tax of importance is the purchase tax,i i1.2   Purchase tax is at present levied at four different rates atthe wholesale stage in the distribution of specified consumer goods.      The. tax is efficient and industry and trade are accustomed to it.     It falls almost wholly on consumer expenditure.      It isnot levied on goods for export, though it has some hidden effecton export prices because tax charged on for example businessstationery is not rebated.      The possibility of extending it to a.wider range of goods has some attractions.      But in practice itwould riot be easy to extend purchase tax to goods generally, andof its nature, purchase tax could not be applied &apos; to. services.     The1l       :, &apos; . (confidential)
retention of purchase tax-has led to the separate taxation ofbase of a significant proportion of consumer expenditure on goods.This has led to tax distortions and anomalies as between differentcategories of goods and between goods and services.1.3   A different approach is necessary.      Instead of a system which taxes some forms of consumer spending but not others, thereis need for a form of tax which falls more evenly on a much wider range of consumer spending in the domestic- economy (with specificreliefs for certain basic items such as food)  without the highlydifferentiated tax structure arising from purchase tax on goods and SET on services.     A general employment (or payroll) tax toreplace, purchase tax and SET would not be satisfactory because,other considerations apart,, it cannot be rebated on exports norcharged on imports.     It would then leave us at a competitivedisadvantage in all markets. j/   [ i i: &apos; jII I &apos; &apos;    &apos; - - j]1.4   There are three forms which a comprehensive consumption taxcould take.      It could be a retail sales tax which could coverservices as well as goods.     But such a tax, at the rates thatwould be required, would introduce a very considerable burden oftaxation at the stage at which goods or services pass to the finalconsumer.     Experience in other countries has-shown that thiswould present very serious difficulties of collection&apos;and control.-Indeed, it is clear that a retail sales tax can be successful only,if the rate, is kept low.     A tax at the retail stage at the level   \necessary to replace, purchase tax and SET is now.widely regardedas impracticable.services, eg SET, and in practice to the exclusion from the tax2
1.5   Then there is a multirstage &quot;cumulative&quot; (or &quot;cascade&quot;) tax,applying at each stage in the production and distribution processbut without relief given for tax paid at earlier&apos; stages.      Such a tax has well-known disadvantages - the amount of tax depends on;the number of stages,  it creates internal economic distortions,both of trade and industrial structure, it acts as a disincentiveto capital investment, and if is difficult to give effective relief to exports or to apply a countervailing charge to imports.      Thesedisadvantages have led many Continental countries to replace taxesof this kind with value-added tax..1.6   Value-added tax avoids the disadvantages both of a selectivetax like purchase tax and of &quot;cumulative&quot; taxes.     Abroad, an increasing number of countries are adopting the value-added-tax.In Prance and Germany value-added tax is well established.Holland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway and Sweden all have value-added taxes;   Belgium, Ireland and Italy will introduce the tax:shortly.1.7   The economic arguments about the effects of value-addedtaxation on the balance of payments, efficiency and growth havebeen the subject of a good deal of public debate following the&apos;publication of earlier studies*.     Any examination of the effects of VAT-on these fields must be related to the. taxes which it isintended.to replace.      The passage of time has altered theReport of the. Committee on Turnover Taxation (Cmnd 2300) - theRichardson Report 1 96h.NEDO Report on Value Added. Tax 1 9693
situation which the Richardson Committee in particular wasexamining.      It was concerned with the arguments for a VAT in substitution for either purchase tax or.profits tax.      It could&apos;find no valid case for the first substitution;   but there was thenno SET, and purchase tax was narrower in coverage than it is to-day and had fewer and lower rates.     It considered&apos;that the balance of argument was against the substitution of a VAT for the profits tax.The NEDO Report argued that the case for considering theintroduction of a VAT in-the immediate future must rest primarily on whether it provided a viable basis for other adjustments in taxation and for extending the tax coverage to goods and servicesnot at present included. -    The present proposition is that on theintroduction of VAT, SET and purchase tax v/ill be abolished.     Thechange proposed would benefit the balance of payments,  since VATcan more fully be remitted on exports.     Some elements of purchase tax (for example on stationery and office equipment) are anindirect burden on exports.     SET on business (other than on thosebusinesses where it is repaid) is wholly unrelieved on exportseven in cases where services are specifically related to exports.By removing the economic distortions of selective indirect taxation VAT will&apos; improve&apos; the efficiency of our indus-tries.1.8   The chief objection levelled against VAT has been its possible effect on the cost of living.      This-argument is oftenover-stated.     It ignores the fact that against increasesattributable to&apos;the introduction of VAT there have to be setcorresponding reductions following the abolition of purchase tax and&apos;selective employment tax. -k .   ..&quot;(confidential)
1.9   The general outline of a possible VAT scheme for thiscountry is described in the following Chapters of this green paper.      Chapter 2 discusses the basic principles of value-addedtaxation,  and Chapter 3 the general scope of a possible scheme.Certain special cases are discussed in Chapter h.      Chapter 5deals with some transitional problems.
CHAPTER   - BASIC PRINCIPLES OF VALUE ADDED TAXATION2.1 &apos; VAT is a form of turnover or sales tax,   Like purchase tax and some other forms of turnover tax, VAT is a tax on finalconsumer expenditure in the domestic economy.   But unlikepurchase tax, which is collected at a single stage in theproduction and distribution chain, VAT. is collected in instalments:liability to tax arises at each stage in the chain, whenever-taxable transactions are carried.out by taxable persons.   VAT,like purchase tax,&apos; also falls on imports of goods.    On exportsVAT is not only not charged directly but, unlike purchase tax,provides machinery for rebating tax entering indirectly intoexport costs.. ;   &apos;2.2   The VAT system described in this Green Paper is that knownas the &quot;invoice&quot; (or &quot;tax from tax&quot;) system.   The reason for thelatter term is that tax invoiced to a taxable person is.deducted from tax invoiced by him to arrive at his net tax liability.This is the system prescribed in the e.c. Directives on value-added tax.   All the coiintries which have introduced VAT have adopted this form of the tax.2.3   Subject to. any provisions for relief in particular cases,the tax&apos;applies to &quot;taxable transactions&quot;,   which include -a.     The delivery of goods or the provision of services inthe home market by a &quot;taxable person&quot;;6
b. Appropriations to private and certain business usesby a &quot;taxable person&quot;;c. &apos;  Imports of goods, whether or not by a &quot;taxable person&quot;.2.k   The precise scope of these expressions will need to be defined in legislation..   For present purposes they should be understood in a very wide sense...  &quot;Taxable person&quot;, for example,includes companies, individuals and partnerships engaged in business, and also members of professions.    As a general guide,and subject to any special.VAT Inclusions or exclusions,&quot;taxable persons&quot; has much the same meaning as those personschargeable to corporation tax or to income tax under Cases I and ii of Schedule D (see paragraph 3.&apos;8) .   The expression &quot;trader&quot;as used in this Green Paper has a similar wide connotation.    Theuse of these terms in the VAT scheme discussed in this green paper is considered further in Chapter 3.2.5   Liability to tax arises whenever a taxable transaction (seeparagraph 2.3) is performed, and does not depend on the profit-ability or otherwise of the transaction nor on whether the taxis recovered from the customer.2.6   Although it is paid by traders, the tax falls in principle on final consumer expenditure.    Subject to special (and simplified)provisions for small traders it works in the following way.    Ifa taxable person (a) delivers goods or provides a service toanother person (B), a is accountable to the tax authorities forthe tax on that transaction and if B is also a taxable person, a
gives him an invoice showing that tax as a separate item. If Bsells to another taxable person (C), B too is accountable for tax and must give C an invoice showing the tax as a separateitem;    and so on down the line of production and distribution,until the final stage when a taxable person sells to a finalconsumer.   At the end of each VAT accounting period each taxableperson totals (a) all the tax invoiced to him or paid by him atimportation;    and (b) all the tax arising on taxable transactions which he himself carries out;    and remits to the tax authorities the amount by which the latter exceeds the former.    If (a) ismore than (b) he may make a claim for credit for the excessfrom the tax authorities (see paragraph 3.20).    Thus a taxableperson has to account for the tax on all the goods he deliversor services he provides (called outputs) in each accountingperiod, but in paying tax to the tax authorities he can takecredit for the tax on goods delivered or services provided tohim (called inputs) whether of a capital or current nature.   Theeffect of this &quot;credit mechanism&quot; is that the tax &quot;rolls forward&quot;at each stage until the point of sale to the consumer.   Theamount of tax collected in this way is thus equal to the amountthat would have been collected had the tax been a single-stagetax on. sales to final consumers, though to collect in the latterway would be impracticable for the reasons already set out inparagraph 1.h.2.7   The net VAT liability of a taxable person in a givenaccounting period might be illustrated by the following example:-8CconfTdential)
confidential); a.   Tax on taxable transactions carried out by him in the period within the UK  1000Less:-b.     Tax invoiced to him,in the period by taxable persons supplying him with goods and services for usein his business (eg purchase of plant and machinery, raw materials,stock for resale, transport services, power etc)  900and   c.     Tax paid by him on taxable goods imported for his business  20 920         920Net amount to b,o paid to the tax authorities(a.-b.-c.) -            802.8   Another way of looking at the credit arrangements is toconsider the progress of a particular article down the productionand distribution chain.   Tax will be charged.on the raw materials,perhaps when they are imported:    as they are worked up into a semi-manufactured and then a final.product, and sold on at sucessivestages, the tax falls on the value added at each stage.2.9 To illustrate this let us take the hypothetical example ofan article, costing hOs retail before tax, on which the rate of- (confidential)
VAT is 1.0 per cent of the tax-exclusive price.    The VAT, which theconsumer would pay, would &quot;be hs, giving a total retail price ofhhs.   The hs tax would have been collected in a series of fractionalpayments.   The number of payments, ie the number of stages in theproduction and distribution chain, is immaterial.    The followingtable shows how the tax on the.article might build up, starting from the raw material stage and.ignoring, for the sake ofsimplicity, other taxable inputs.Tax Tax on     Tax remittedexclusive     trans-     to the taxprice action     authoritiess   dProducer of inter-mediate productimports rawmaterials having an import value ofProducer makesintermediateproduce and sellsit to a manufac-turer for   010   0Manufacturer makesfinal article andsells it toretailer for 250Retailer sellsarticle toconsumer- forhO   0Total paid by final \ Q Qconsumers   d1    02   64 opluss   d-,6k - 0confidentialProducer pays 6d tax atimportationProducer is accountablefor 1s tax but takescredit for 6d tax paid at importation andinvoices 1s tax to hiscustomerManufacturer is account-able for 2s 6d tax buttakes credit for 1s taxinvoiced to him byproducer and invoices2s 6d tax - to theretailerRetailer is accountablefor hs tax but takescredit for 2s 6d taxinvoiced to him bymanufacturer
ins dsiI ilA2.10   Imports and exports. - As the foregoing example &quot;tarings out,VAT applies to imports of goods as well as to deliveries in thehome, market.   Tax at importation is payable whether or not theimporter is a &quot;taxable person&quot;.   But importers who are taxablepersons take credit for VAT paid at importation in the same way as-they do for tax invoiced to them by domestic suppliers of.goods and services.    Conversely, exports of goods are relieved of tax.The underlying principle is that export sales are not chargeablewith VAT, while exporters who are taxable persons can take credit for, or have repaid to them, the tax invoiced&apos;to them (or paid atimportation) on the&apos; inputs to those sales.    The arrangements for relief are described more fully below.   The territorial applicationof the tax to services follows a similar pattern.   The underlyingprinciple is that all services provided within the tax territory would be taxable.I2.11    Reliefs. - There are several ways in which relief from VATcan be given to particular classes of goods or services, or particular classes of traders, eg exemption, zero-rating, theapplication of a lower rate of tax than the standard rate, or somecombination of these methods.    All these procedures feature in theVAT scheme described later in this Green Paper.    It should beborne in mind that a VAT is in principle a comprehensive tax andthat reliefs reduce revenue and complicate administration.   Themore reliefs there are, the more others have to pay to raise a given revenue.-  Further, the implications of reliefs may go beyondthe particular traders to whom they are directed, and affect other11
traders with whom they deal or with whom they compete.    Any case for relief must therefore be judged against stringent criteria.2.12   Exemption. - Exemption for a transaction means that noliability to account for tax to the tax authorities arises whenthe transaction is performed.    Equally, the trader undertaking the exempt transaction is given no credit by the tax authorities for any tax invoiced to him by his suppliers, or paid atimportation, in respect of the goods and services he uses forhis exempt business.   The operation of the credit mechanismthroughout a chain of transactions is thereby interrupted.2.13   If a trader providing exempt goods and services wishes to recoup the tax invoiced to him by his suppliers (or paid atimportation) he is free to do so through the prices he charges tohis customers.   But since he is not accountable to the taxauthorities he is not allowed to show any element of tax as aseparate item on&apos;his sales invoices.   The tax paid at earlier stages and entering in this way into the price of exempt goods and services is thus a &quot;hidden tax&quot;.    If the exempt goods and services are acquired by a taxable person the latter is unableto take any credit for this hidden tax.   Thus, exemption is by no means always an advantage.    It may, however, provide a simpleway of relieving from tax in appropriate cases the value addedby the provider of a service to final consumers.12
2.1U   Ah important administrative advantage of exemption is thata trader whose only business consisted&apos; in carrying out exempttransactions would not need to he registered by the taxauthorities.    This would be a saving in work both for the traderand for the authorities.    If, however, part of a trader&apos;s outputswere exempt and part taxable he would need to be registered inrespect of his taxable transactions.   He would be entitled to takecredit for tax falling on the inputs to his taxable outputs, butnot for tax falling on the inputs to his exempt outputs.    If sucha trader were allowed to take credit for tax on all his inputshe would have an unfair advantage over the wholly exempt trader,who would not be entitled to any credit for tax.    establishing the credit entitlement of partially exempt traders can be acomplicated matter.    This is explained further in the Appendix tothis Green Paper.2.15   Zero-rating. - Zero-rating a transaction means that it is.brought within the scope of the tax, but the rate applied to theoutput is zero.    If the person carrying out the transaction is ataxable person he is accountable in the usual way;   but the result is that his outputs carry no tax because a zero rate is appliedto them, while he is allowed credit for or repayment of tax on.,his inputs.   Exports of goods will be relieved from tax by meansof this technique.   Transactions other than exports could alsobe zero-rated, but the technique is one that could only bejustified in very exceptional circumstances..    Where relief to particular kinds of transaction is contemplated, exemption might13
be considered, but to go further and remit tax on all the inputsas well by zero-rating would be a very different, matter.    Thiswould reduce the size of the tax base, so that other transactionsby other traders would have to bear a higher rate of tax to raisethe same total revenue.    It would also mean that, scarce resources would have to be deployed by the tax authorities to register andcontrol the traders carrying out the zero-rated transactions with no corresponding benefit to the revenue.2.16   Lower Rates. - Some relief for particular classes of transactions can be given by subjecting them to a lower rate of tax than the standard rate.    This is a practice found in theVAT systems of all the e.c. countries.    In such cases full credit for tax on inputs is given even when this was at the standard -rate so that the effective rate of tax on the transactions is thelower rate.tjih
CHAPTER 3 - GENERAL SCOPE OP A POSSIBLE SCHEME FOR THIS COUNTRY3*1     General.-   Matters such as the rate or rates of tax anddetails-of coverage can be decided only in the light of all thecircumstances at the time of introduction of a VAT.   Withoutprejudging such issues in this Green Paper it is desirable to focusattention on certain special problems and to indicate possiblesolutions to them.    1&apos;his Chapter gives a general outline of how theprinciples in Chapter 2 might be applied to a VAT in this country.It should not be assumed that the detailed issues&apos; discussed in this and the following Chapter will necessarily be settled in the wayhere, described.   However, for&apos; the purposes of the Green Paper it hasbeen assumed that while VAT will replace purchase tax and SET,, othercustoms and excise duties (eg those on. tobacco, alcoholic drinks andhydrocarbon oils) will in general be retained, with any necessary,adaptations.-3.2     Taxable Transactions.--     The scope of the charging provisions(see paragraph 2.3) will need to be widely drawn.   The underlyingprinciple will be a tax applying to all business transactions of whatever kind (including retail trade),   with specific exceptions,.rather than a tax applicable to. a selected list of transactions.3*3*     Goods.-     The expression, &quot;goods&quot; will need to be carefullydefined, particularly in relation to land and buildings.&apos;  the distinction familiar in direct taxation between expenditure on capital items.(which is only relieved, if at all, by capitalallowances)&apos;;and expenditure on non-capital items (which is generally. allowed) would not apply in the case of VAT, except in some special15
cases, eg partially exempt traders (see paragraph 3.16).3.4    Deliveries.-     In addition to sales, deliveries of goodswould cover other transactions involving transfer of ownership and,for example, hiring and hire purchase.   Certain transactions inrelation to goods (eg process work) might he treated either asdeliveries or as the provision of services. . -3.5   . Appropriations.-     This&apos; term refers in general to transfers&quot;by a taxable person of items from his business to non-business use,eg to the use of his family or employees, or to himself in his private capacity;    or to certain business uses.&apos;    These transactionsmight be brought within the scope of the tax either by treating them as deliveries or services and so subject to a specific tax chargeor, in some cases, by disallowing credit for tax on the inputs tothem (see paragraphs 3.22 and 3.23).3*6     Services.-     In principle, the provision of a service shouldbe understood as any business.transaction not amounting to a delivery of goods or appropriation in the above sense.   Consumer services such as hotels and restaurants, entertainment and hairdressing wouldbe covered, as would services used by business (for example managementconsultancy, office cleaning services) and services, such as thoseof lawyers and accountants, used by both private persons, and business.3.7     The expression &quot;services&quot; might well include, inter alia,repairs and., maintenance;    transactions involving patents, designs,trademarks and industrial know-how,;,   the services&apos; of architects and;surveyors; &apos; advertising, transport and storage services;    employmen16
agency services;    the services of consultants, engineers and planning offices;    the services of forwarding agents, &quot;brokers,business agents etc.i3*8     Taxable persons.-     Except for importations of goods,transactions would in general be taxable.only when undertaken by&quot;taxable persons&quot; (see paragraph 2.U).     This expression should be understood as applying not only to companies, but also to individuals,partnerships and other bodies engaged in trading^or professionalactivities in a wide sense.    The expression does not, however, includeemployees acting in that capacity.3*9     Registration.-     For the purposes of control all personsdelivering&apos;chargeable goods or providing chargeable services willhave to be registered with the Tax authorities whether they actuallypay tax or&apos; not, and to enable this to be done they will be requiredto give the authorities certain particulars of their businessactivities.    Thus small traders, whether or not below the exemptionlimit (see paragraph h*k) will be required to register, but personsdealing wholly in exempt goods will not.3.10     The process -of registration will take several months andwill, need to be completed before the date on which the tax becomesoperative.    In addition, traders will need time to familiarisethemselves with the details of the tax procedure.\ -17 &apos; ;
IN  5 tfMM3.11     Accounts.-     Persons accountable for tax will have tomaintain the accounts necessary to establish their VAT liability,their entitlement to issue invoices showing tax and theirentitlement to credit for tax on Inputs.3.12     Tax, point.-     Liability to tax will arise when the transaction takes place, eg when the goods are imported ordelivered or the service is provided;   but in certain cases,eg services provided over a -period of time., or the delivery ofa major installation with payments on account, special rules willbe needed to determine the times at which the tax becomes due.andat which credits may be taken.3.13     Value.-     The value for tax would in general be the invoiceprice, inclusive of. other duties and taxes, but exclusive of VAT;.however, where the price consisted wholly or partly of a consideration other than money, or where there was no consideration,a notional value would need to be assessed.     A notional value might also be needed if the buyer and seller were not dealing at arm&apos;slength.   Provision would also be needed for adjustment, eg if goods were not up to sample and a lower price was negotiated.3.14     Accounting periods.-     The assessment of the tax -will bebased on prescribed accounting periods, which might be of threemonths.   To give an even flow of tax returns and remittances,arrangements might be made under which returns were.staggered,with about one third of the traders making them each month.   Traders18
would be accountable in respect of taxable transactions undertaken by them in each accounting period.    In any period a trader&apos;s netliability (or net credit) would be equal to tax at the appropriaterate on his taxable transactions in the period minus tax paid atimportation and minus tax invoiced to him by accountable suppliersof taxable goods and services in the period.    Thus the taxabletransactions effected by a trader in a period would not be directly related to his inputs in that period.    For the purpose of assessingliability this would not matter:    credit for tax on purchases wouldnot be tied to the re-sale of those items, and would be allowed in.respect of capital inputs as well as current ones.3*15     Invoices-.-     Most retail sales&apos;apart,  each trader accountablefor tax will give each of his customers an invoice showing the amountof VAT on the transaction,  in addition to the particulars needed for the purposes of his business.    If the goods and services providedwere taxable at different rates, or included exempt items, detailswould be shown on the invoice to enable the transactions in eachcategory to be identified.    A copy of the invoice would be retained by the trader who issued it.    In their own interests tradersaccountable for tax will need to ensure that their suppliers provide them with invoices in this way, so that they are in a position tosupport the claim for credit of tax in their own tax returns.Traders not accountable for tax will not, of course, be entitled to - ,deliver invoices showing the tax separately..3.16-    Partially exempt traders.-   - A &quot;trader undertaking taxabletransactions as well as exempt ones will be entitled to claim credit-1Q
for tax-on the inputs to his taxable transactions but not on theinputs to his exempt transactions.    In some cases particular types of input might be related to particular types of outputs (eg stockfor resale) but for the rest rules will be needed to determine theproportion of tax on inputs in respect of which credit may be claimed(see the Appendix to this Green Paper).3.17     Imports.-     The procedure for charging VAT at importationwill need to include the provision of evidence of pa3^ment of VATto s\ipport subsequent claims for credit by traders entitled to makethose claims.   Ancillary questions which arise include the treatment for VAT purposes of goods temporarily imported, or taken intowarehouse oh importation.3*1$     Exports.-   -Exports by taxable persons will be relieved fromtax by zero-rating, as described in paragraph 2.15.3.19     Payment of tax.-     Each trader accountable for tax will berequired to pay VAT to the tax authorities on the basis of a returnmade at the end of each accounting period.    In addition to otherdetails the return would show the amount of VAT on the trader&apos;staxable transactions and the amount of credit claimed in respect of tax on inputs.3*20     Repayments.-     Por some traders the. tax on their purchases-of goods and services will exceed the tax on the taxabletransactions carried out by them.    Traders with a large export business will regularly be in this position.    Others may find&apos;- - - 20
themselves in this situation from time to time.    It will of course&quot;be necessary to have rules governing credit for or repayment of the excess of tax on inputs over tax on outputs.3.21     Annual statement.-     Traders accountable for tax might berequired to complete an annual declaration including a summary of sales and purchases during the preceding year.    This would providethe basis for any necessary adjustment of tax already paid.    Othertraders including those paying under a simplified arrangement (see paragraphs h.2 and h.3) might also be required to provide annualstatements.3*22&apos; Special restrictions.-    In a few cases the right to claimcredit for tax on inputs might be restricted as an alternative totaxing the transaction as an appropriation (see paragraph 3.5).Examples are:-a. goods and services which have both a business and aprivate use eg business cars;    business entertainment;electricity, gas-and telephones in flats combined withshops.    &apos;ihe reason for the restriction would be tosafeguard the interests of other taxpayers, and of therevenue, in cases- where business and private use could. not be satisfactorily distinguished.b. goods and services acquired for, or produced by, atrader^&apos;s business which are transferred to private use.21
3.23     Intermediate goods and services.-     In some countries witha VAT tax is chargeable on certain deliveries, &quot;by the trader to himself for the purpose of his business.   .I,vor example, if a traderpurchased exempt goods or services and used them to carry out taxabletransactions there could be a   hidden tax on his purchase which he might wish to avoid by making the exempt goods or providing theexempt services within his own business.     Conversely, a traderwith exempt outputs might wish to avoid paying tax to his suppliersof taxable goods and services.by making the taxable goods orproviding the taxable services within his own business.    If therewere the possibility of such activities resulting in seriousdistortion of trade or revenue loss it might be necessary to have aspecial provision in the VAT system.3.2k     Administration.-     VAT will be administered by HM customs and Excise to whom any questions or comments on the administrativeaspects of the tax should be addressed.22
CHAPTER h - SPECIAL CASES  -h.1    General.      As has heen explained,  the scope for givingspecial treatment under VAT is limited.      However,  special treat-ment would be required in some cases and this Chapter describes thebe that any business activity in an area not covered by this chapter would be within the scope&apos; of the tax.     One of the purposesof this Green Paper is to. invite attention to the question whether there are any other areas which ought to be. subject to special rules,h.2   Nationalised Industries.      In principle nationalised industries should be treated in regard to their trading activities in the same way as commercial firms.      The precise coverage of the tax in the fuel,  transport and communication sectors (including,where appropriate, corresponding private activities) will require consideration, and it may&apos;be found appropriate to have a reduced rate applying to some of these activities.h.3   Government Departments and Local Authorities.      an appropriate principle would be to subject the outputs of these bodies where they compete with the private sector to arrangementscorresponding with those applicable to their competitors.      Tothat end, Government Departments would be liable to the tax, and goods and services provided by local authorities to the public in competition with the private sector,would also be liable.Arrangements could be made to relieve from tax other activitiesprincipal items wlhich might be concerned.The presumption would of local authorities.23
Small traders.      On administrative, grounds an exemption for&quot;small&quot; traders would.lie desirable when their taxable turnover wasbelow a specified annual. amount.      This&apos; could substantially reducethe number of traders accountable for VAT and relieve thoseexempted from the obligation to keep full VAT accounts.      Theturnover limit for such an exemption would need to take intoaccount (a) administrative cost to both taxpayers and the tax&apos;authorities,  (b) possible revenue loss and (c) competition betweenexempt traders and traders accountable for VAT..h.5    In other countries with a VAT the exemption is generallyfixed at a relatively low level and is accompanied by some taper-ing provision for those traders just outside the exemption.     Apossible method in-this country would be to provide an alternativetax (an annual charge based on turnover) which would apply totraders with small turnover;    they would of course have to remainoutside the VAT system (ie they would not be able to claim credit for tax&apos;on their inputs, and they would not be able to show tax asa separate item on their sales invoices so that their customerswould get no credits).     Following the purchase tax precedent,very small traders with turnover below a specified, figure wouldnot be required to pay either VAT or this alternative tax.h.6   Food;   farmers and fishermen.     In e.c. countries with a.VATin operation food is taxed,  though at a reduced rate for at leastbasic agricultural products.     If our application to join theCommunity is successful, we shall, of course, within such periodof transition as may.be negotiated, have to come into line withother Members in so far as taxation is harmonised.     In the2U
meantime we are free to consider also other ways of giving relief to food and food products.      They might be zero-rated, but then allfarmers would still have to &quot;be brought within the&apos; VAT system;    thiswould involve them in keeping records and making regular returnsand would also lead to extra administrative costs in controllingand making repayments to them.     A better course, which would substantially relieve from tax&apos; most food and food products - apartperhaps from those at present chargeable with purchase tax, and thefood element in catering .services - would be to exempt them and atthe same time to zero-rate main specialised inputs of farmers,such as some animal feeding stuffs, lime, fertilisers,  insecticides,farm machinery and tools,  specialist agricultural services andfarm buildings.      Main specialised inputs of the fishing industrycquld he similarly zero-rated.4.7   The effect would be that in so. far as farmers produced onlynon-taxable food or food products,  they would be outside the scopeof the tax.      They would of course he required to account for taxif they undertook any taxable transactions,  unless they came -within the scope of a &quot;small trader&quot; exemption.4.8   Housing and accommodation.      Other countries with a VAT make special arrangements of various kinds for housing;    these differ in different countries, both in the nature of the reliefs provided and the circumstances in which they apply.      Similarly special arrangements for housing would be needed in a VAT in this countryand these would have to be related to our own circumstances.Relief from. VAT in some form might&apos;be provided in respect of sales2.5
and rents of houses and other domestic accommodation, though repair and maintenance of buildings and. letting of short-term accommodation for example in hotels and holiday camps, would &quot;be &quot;within the tax.Finance.     A VAT which is an appropriate method of taxingflows of goods and services is not appropriate for taxing flows ofmoney and paper representing money.      Other countries with a VATexempt financial services,  though these services are sometimessubject to a special tax.--   For administrative reasons a number of transactions in this sector would probably have to be exempt fromVAT, including life-assurance and the services of banks.      somewhat similar considerations apply to other transactions in this sectorsuch as dealings in securities and in commodities (eg futures).U.10   Health.      Some relief from VAT will be needed here.      Thus &apos;doctors could be exempted and arrangements could be made to relievefrom tax&apos; services and drugs provided by the National Health ServiceEducation. A somewhat similar problem arises in regard to education. &apos; But many educational supplies are at present subjectto purchase tax, and these might be liable to.VAT.h&apos;12   Charities and re1igious. institutions.      The princip1e wouldbe that the trading activities of charities should be subject toVAT in the same way as those of other bodies operating in the samefield.      Consideration could be. given to ways of relieving fromtax purchases by charities of certain specialised capital assets,for example- church buildings, hospitals, and schools, and to the* *26CONr DENTIA
ii l.question of exempting certain other Inputs of charities related to.their fund-raising or other non-trading activities.U.13   Second-hand good s,_antiques, etc...    In most VAT countriessales by&apos; way of trade of second-hand goods are taxable in the same way as sales of new goods.      Thus although sales by members of thepublic to dealers would not be taxable,  tax would be charged onsales by dealers, whether to other dealers or to. members of thepublic.      It is common to. apply special rules to. second-hand cars,so that, for example, a trader buying a used car from a privateseller and then reselling it would be liable  to VAT&apos;only, on hisgross margin,  ie the difference between bis ,buying price and hisselling price.     Antiques,  like original -works of art,  are usuallyexempted...h. 1U   Books&quot;,__journals, newspapers, etc.      If it. were consideredappropriate to give relief to books, newspapers,  journals,magazines, music scores,  etc,  this could be done by exemption.Advertising services could, however, remain taxable.     Publishersof newspapers, etc selling advertising services would then beaccountable for tax on those sales (with appropriate credit for tax on inputs) while their customers,  if accountable for tax,would be entitled to take credit.for this tax against the tax ontheir own outputs.
CHAPTER 5 - SOME TRANSITIONAL PROBLEMS5.1    General.      The introduction of VAT will involve a major changeboth for the trading community and for -the tax authorities.Solutions will have to he found to a number of novel problems, manyof which require further consideration and consultation with those affected.5.2    Termination of purchase tax.      If only to raise essentialrevenue, purchase tax will need to continue to be chargeable untilVAT is introduced, and will be payable by registered purchase taxtraders in the usual way.5*3   Tax paid stocks.     Goods in stock on the introduction of VATwould be chargeable with VAT when sold after that date.      If thegoods&apos; had already borne purchase tax the question might arisewhether any relief should be given against VAT liability, and if so what method to adopt. &apos;&apos;5.h   Existing contracts.      Under existing legislation, any increase or reduction in a rate of customs or excise duty or purchase tax,or the imposition or abolition of a new duty or purchase taxcharge, may be passed on in the price of the goods supplied,notwithstanding the terms of the original contract in respect ofthe goods.     A similar provision will no doubt be required in VATlegislation.28confidential
APPENDIXPARTIALLY EXEMPT traders.      As noted in paragraph 3.16 a trader providing taxable as wellas exempt goods or services would be entitled to claim credit for tax on his inputs only in so far as&apos; they related to taxable outputs.In some cases particular- types of inputs could be related to particular types of outputs;    but where this was not practicable analternative, adopted in other countries, might be to allow credit for tax on inputs in the ratio of taxable to total outputs (&quot;Pro-rata rule&quot;).      Taxable outputs would include exports and other zero-rated sales, and taxable-appropriations.      The ratio would providethe percentage of the total tax on the trader&apos;s inputs for which hecould claim credit.      In some cases, however,  this alternative-might not be practicable and it might then be necessary to calculate the ratio by reference to the proportion of taxable to total innuts.2.     A period of 12 months might be an appropriate base period forthese calculations.     For any given year the necessary .data couldnot be ascertained until that year was completed and a provisionalassessment of the percentage would therefore have to be made.When the full year had elapsed a reassessment could be made on thebasis of the trader&apos;s outturn for that year, and any adjustment madeby way of credit or repayment to the trader or additional payment by the .trader.29
1A I3&apos;      Capital inputs.      If credit for tax on capital inputs could betaken in the same way as credit for tax on other inputs,  it wouldbe necessary to provide for adjustment of the amount of tax on capital inputs for which credit was initially claimed, because atrader&apos;s ratio of taxable to total outputs might fluctuateconsiderably during the lifetime of the capital, asset.      In the eec countries,  the^possibility of adjustment &quot;runs for the five-   years following acquisition of the capital asset,  and at the endof each of those five years one fifth of the amount initiallyclaimed as credit can be increased or reduced according to the.-    actual pro rata percentage calculated for that year.      Such an. arrangement for capital items would add considerably to the complexity of the pro rata arrangements, both as regards the calculations, and as regards the need to distinguish betweencapital and non-capital inputs.      However, without.such an arrange-ment it would be open to a trader with both taxable, and exemptoutputs to purchase his capital.assets in a year in which he .undertook only taxable transactions, and to claim credit for thewhole of the tax on.those assets.     This kind of distortion couldbe corrected only by an adjustment of the credit entitlement inrespect of tax on the asset over a period of years following itsacquis ition. &apos; . I30
