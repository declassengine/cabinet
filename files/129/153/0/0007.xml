DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 82 COPY NO 5412 October 1970CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT MANUAL WORKERS1 dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentL The Governments present policy in relation to this dispute is basedon the need to support the local authorities in their determination to stand firm and not to settle the pay dispute in excess of an amount of about 14 percent.    In support of the policy of standing firm, the conciliation servicesof the Department of Employment and Productivity have not been madeavailable,2, The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies have been preparedto consider sympathetically requests from individual local authorities forassistance involving the use of Service personnel if this became necessary on public health grounds,3,        At today&apos;s meeting of the Ministerial Committee, concern was expressed over the possibility of the situation deteriorating, due to an increasing number of local authorities being prepared to make separatesettlements.    There was, it was thought, a good deal of public sympathy with the strikers.    The unions were bringing increasing pressure to bearon Swindon, the Chairman of the employers&apos; side being a member of that authority.    Since there was no public health risk in Swindon, requests forassistance could not be met under the present policy,&apos;4*        The Minister of Housing and Local Government is under considerablpressure from river authorities to give advice as to how they shoulddischarge their statutory responsibility for preventing pollution in rivers,5, There are three factors which, as the strike continues, increasethe probability of local authorities weakening; the volunteers becomingtired and unable to continue, the likelihood of plant breakdowns, and thefears of legal claims by riparian owners alarming local authorities intheir responsibilities towards the ratepayers.    Anxieties over legalclaims might be eased if the Government were able to make a statement on assistance for local authorities in meeting the total compensation bill;but it is impossible at this stage to estimate what the cost might be.
6. The risks of putting in the troops are not to be underrated.    Thestrike might be greatly extended; if the supervisory staffs went out, thetroops would find it difficult to operate the plant; the troops would not beable to stop pollution; and once they were supplied to one local authoritywe should be deluged with requests from others on a scale which could notbe met - at any rate if we departed from the strict test that intervention was warranted only on grounds of a threat to public health,7,        It seemed to the Committee that we now had to decide whether weshould keep to our present strategy.    There are considerable arguments for doing this; there is as yet no threat to public health, and the unions maynot be as well placed as might appear to keep up the struggle,8, On the other hand, whilst we must not attach too much importanceto public support for the strikers (there are many people who hope that theauthorities will stand firm), nevertheless, for the reasons set out inparagraph 5, there is a possibility of the local authorities crumblingaway, and the Committee thought that the time had come when it was right to consider whether the Government should depart from the presentstrategy, and take some initiative,9,        If it were so decided, then it is a question whether to take an initiative at the national or a local level,10,       It would be possible at the national level to call separate meetings with the unions and the employers.    In the former case the purpose wouldbe to stress to the national union leaders the determination of the Govern-ment to do all in its power to protect public health and to ensure theminimum inconvenience to the public, reiterating the view expressedby the Minister of Housing and Local Government at Blackpool that theoffer of around 14 per cent was indeed a generous one.    The meeting with the employers would reiterate the Governments support for theirstand and might include a statement on the use of Service personnel,11,        If initiative is to be taken at a local level, it is possible that theparticular situation in Cardiff may soon provide an appropriate peg.The national union leaders would be advised that a serious health riskexists in Cardiff and, if unions are not prepared to help with the manningof the Penarth Road pumping station, to indicate that Service personnel would be moved in.    Such action could precipitate other demands from local authorities for troops and some of these could be met.    It ispossible that the unions at Cardiff might agree to co-.operate, and this could make it more difficult to deploy troops elsewhere on grounds otherthan public health; but this seems unlikely,R m home Office SW112 October 1970
