DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTK iiCP(70) 96 COPY NO    3&quot;28 October 1970CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE MONOPOLIES commission memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. At the meeting of the Economic Strategy Committee on 28 July Iwas asked to arrange for examination by an official interdepartmental committee of the desirable scope and appropriate institutionalarrangements for handling issues of competition and incomes and to bring forward recommendations for consideration in thefirst instance in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy(EPC).    The Cabinet has already considered my proposals on incomes,and EPC have asked me to report to the Cabinet their conclusions on the monopolies Commission,    Since responsibility for policy in this fieldwill shortly be passing from me to the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry the memorandum is limited to a summary of the position andthe arguments which have so far been presented on the disputed issues.2.        We agreed that the pragmatic approach to monopolies shouldcontinue with each case being considered on its merits and no presumption that anything which limits competition is necessarily undesirable.    we agreed that there should be no change in the present arrangement underwhich the Commission^ role on formal references is to investigate andreport, and the exercise of remedial powers is entirely in Ministers1hands.    We also agreed that investigations of monopoly should be,conducted by a body with greater status and powers than those of thepresent Monopolies Commission and with a stronger and more expertstaff.3*        The following specific measures suggested by officials to develop the work and increase the standing of the Monopolies Commission havebeen accepted, subject to the qualifications indicated:a.      The powers of formal inquiry by the Commission should beextended to cover public monopolies such as nationalised industries and other statutory trading bodies which are in a monopoly position.
b. The Commission should also be able to make &quot;efficiencystudies&quot; of nationalised industries.    These would be primarily concerned with how a Board achieved its results within the framework of existing policy,,    Efficiency studies would not normally be made at intervals of less than five years.    TheCommittee considered that the nationalised industries shouldnot be subjected to investigation at too frequent intervals; this danger would be safeguarded against because the initiative for references of nationalised industries would rest with the responsible minister (who would not be precluded from arranging inquiries intothe affairs of industries in other ways, for instance through the useof management consultants),c. In addition to the traditional comprehensive inquiries, theCommission should be able (where &quot;monopoly conditions&quot; exist)to undertake limited inquiries, taking she to nine months, intospecific issues including price questions.d. The Commission should have the duty to collect information about how competition is working and about industrial structure andto publish its findings from time to time.    The Committee agreedthat, for this purpose, the Commission should be given powers tocall for information, but that the exercise of these powers (includingperhaps the power to publish findings) should be subject to ministerial oversight.e. If the power to refer mergers to the Commission is retainedthe assets test for the reference of mergers should be increased from  5 million to  10 million.imf0       The staff of the Commission should be strengthened.    a director-General should be appointed and there should be twofull-time members of the Commission in addition to the Chairman,4, The two important issues on which it was not possible for theCommittee to reach agreement were whether the power to investigateproposed mergers should continue and whether the main initiative formonopoly and merger inquiries should be transferred from the Ministerto an independent authority (whether the Commission itself or, in line with previous proposals, a Registrar of Monopolies^INVESTIGATION OF MERGERS5, The Committee were equally divided about the need to retain the merger powers under the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965,    Some feltthat such powers were unnecessary and undesirable.    Other members ofthe Committee believed that at least a reserve power to refer particularmergers for investigation ought to be retained (subject to the increase inthe assets limit to  10 million).
6, The points made in discussion against continuing the power were;i. It involved just the kind of interference in industrial affairs with which we as a Government are opposed and use of the power was inevitably based on inadequate knowledge.ii. The power to refer mergers had been used infrequentlyand the outcome had seldom been helpful when it had been used.iii. It would be better to rely instead on the power to investigatemonopolies to deal with mergers the results of which seemed to be operating against the public interest.    The Government could alsowarn firms where it was clear that a prospective merger would be contrary to the public interest and, if necessary, use the powers under the monopolies legislation thereafter to require divestment.7.        Arguments against dropping the power to investigate mergers were:i. It would be at variance with the Governments declared policy of encouraging competition,,    Moreover, a power of independentinvestigation of mergers was proposed in the 1964 White Paper onmonopolies, mergers and restrictive practices published by theprevious Conservative Government and we have consistentlysupported it since.ii. The power would not be used frequently but it was desirableto have it available to deal with the occasional merger which clearlypresented a threat to the public interest.&apos; iii.       It was better to act against an undesirable merger before itwas carried through.    Reliance on the powers to require divestment(following a monopoly inquiry by the Commission) would raise serious problems.    Often the mergers - for instance relating to newspapers -which it v/as desirable to &amp;top raised political rather than economicissues which were not appropriate to be dealt with under the monopolies legislation.INITIATION OF INQUIRIES BY THE COMMISSION8.        The Committee were also unable to reach agreement on the proposal that the initiative for formal investigations into monopolies and mergersshould normally be transferred from the Minister to an independent authority and if so what the best institutional arrangements for the purpose would be.As a substitute for the earlier proposal that initiative should rest with aRegistrar of Monopolies, officials had proposed that the Commission wouldbe empowered to propose to the Minister subjects (monopolies and mergers)for formal inquiry; the proposals would be published and provided they received the Minister^ consent within a specified period, the Commission3
would undertake them.    In addition the Minister would retain anindependent power to refer matters to the Commission for formal inquiry.EPC agreed that, if the new Commission had the power to initiate proposals,ministers sanction should be required for investigation of both monopolies and mergers and that Ministers should also have the right to refer to theCommission monopolies which had not been suggested by the commission for investigation.9.        Beyond this views were divided.    Some members of the committee considered that the Commission should have the power subject to Ministerialconsent and also that responsibility for the preliminary scrutiny of mergersshould be transferred from Departments to the Commission.   arguments for the proposal can be summarised as that it would cut down work inDepartment, would build up the independence of the Commission, would diminish the scope for Government intervention in industry based on political considerations, and would be a considerable improvement over thepresent system of references which has led to an extremely uneven spread of work and the consequence that the Commission has not been able to formulate guiding principles.    The arguments against the Commission^initiative are that it could lead to empire building, impose an undue burden on industry, lead to too many proposals for references and possibly frustratedesirable mergers - it being the view of those opposing the power ofinitiative that the present system of references to the Commission has worked satisfactorily.10.       The Committee agreed that it was neither necessary nor practicable to introduce monopolies legislation in the present Session of Parliamentbut that the Governments proposals should be made public in the near future.In the light of the decision made by the Cabinet on the outstanding issuesset out above officials would thereafter be asked to produce draft proposals in the form in which they could be published.R department of Employment SWl26 October 1970A
