confidential)A3 003ItjISCUSSION WITH1 FRENCH. GERMAN AND PUT OH MINISTERS ON 2 3RD OCTOBER1REP0RT 3Y THE MINISTER OF AVIATION supply.    At the talks in Paris, M. Mondon put forward on behalf of thethree Governments the following proposals for the British Governmentto rejoin them in the A.300B.2.     (i)   We should accept the arrangements made in the Franco/german agreement of 29th May 1969 and the decisions already made by theGovernments and firms in pursuance of this agreement.Comment;    If we decide to join, this would need detailed examination but it is reasonable in principle and shouldnot present difficulty.   We should thus, become partners in the whole programme.(ii)   We would be represented on the Committee of officials setup under the May 1969 agreement. &apos; -    . ,(iii)   The programme covered by the May 1969 agreement would beextended by the launching of a stretched version of, the aircraft(to be known as the A.300B7) proposed by the firms.   The development cost to the Governments of the original version (A.300B1) is fixed at  175M (at 1968 price levels).   The additional development cost for the B7 version is estimated at  20M by the firms.   This estimatecovers the work required to adapt both the Bl and B7 versions to use the SB.211 engine.   But it is an estimate only and there is not as yet a fixed commitment by the firms/&apos;Comment:   The  20M estimate would need to be examined and an agreement negotiated with the firms to limit theliability of the participating Governments before the B7version is launched.   We have insufficient information atpresent to assess the validity of the estimate but itappears to be of the right order.(iv)     The French, Germafi, and British Governments should share equally the cost of developing both the Bl and B7 versions.Ihe size of each Government&apos;s share will depend on whether other european countries join in the programme.   Depending on whetherItaly and,Belgium join the programme, the share could be between27fo and 30$ for France, Germany, and the UK.   At 27$ the UK sharewould be  52.65M (subject to the  20M estimate proving correct).Hawker Siddeley&apos;s corresponding share of the work would increase from 16$ to 23$, and might be further increased if Italy do not join.fCQNFIDENTTAlA
(v)   Of the  52.65M the following sums have already &quot;beenfunded:(a)  18.5M &quot;by the German Government to cover development work being done by Hawker Siddeley but not financed bythem.We would be required to guarantee the refunding of this sum to the German Government.(b)  11.51 has been funded by Hawker Siddeley and isrecoverable by them over sales of 150 aircraft.We would be required to guarantee the repayment of this sum to the other Governments (i.e. we should be at riskif fewer than 150 aircraft are sold).(c) leaving  22.65M of new money to be funded by us over three years.Comment:   The financial implications of the guaranteesare difficult to assess but they are almost certain to involve us in fixture expense.   They depend on the numberof aircraft sold and the rate of recovery by Governmentsof the development cost through sales.The proposed aircraft selling price aims to give theGovernments recovery over 360 aircraft, but there areimplicit provisions that, if the price has to be cut,the Government recovery will be prolonged.The rate of recovery to the Governments through salesincreases as the number of sales increases.   When 200aircraft are sold the Governments will have recoveredl/3 of their investment; at 280 sales 2/3rds and at360 sales the total (all in undiscounted terms).(vi)     An agreement covering our rejoining the project should becompleted within three months.(vii)     The work required to enable the aircraft to be offeredwith Rolls-Royce engines must not delay the programmes for the Blequipped with GE engines.   Airline customers must be absolutely free to choose the engine they prefer.Oomment;. The first part of this proposal could be extremely restrictive.   In discussion, the French, and germans agreed that it would be interpreted broadlywith the aim of making the Rolls-Royce engined versionavailable as soon as possible.We said that the second part of this provision was unacceptable.   It was not acceptable to say thatrejoining the A300B is &quot;a European test&quot; while notapplying the same logic to the engine.   We discussed this aspect at length and we were invited to suggestan alternative.   We put forward the following:(confidential)
(confidential- J -&quot;Recognising that the maintenance of an effective European aero-engine industry isas important in the context of european co-operation as the maintenance of a european airframe industry, the participating governments will use their influence to insurethat their national airlines reflect this intheir purchasing policy.&quot;The other Governments agreed to consider this.While I am clear that they would not accept anystronger wording, this will of course involve no real commitment and we must recognise that governments are unlikely to issue positive directions to their national airlines to fly Rolls Royce,especially in view of the fact that these airlinesare committed in varying degrees to the GeneralElectric engine in the DC10.(viii)   The German Secretary of State made it clear that any-financial support from Germany for the RB211-61 (or the more expensive RB211-50 which they seemed to prefer) would have to henegotiated as part of a new off-set agreement for which he thoughtnegotiations should start some time next year.   Officials suggested to us that  20/301 might be available, but there were indications that this sum might also have to cover the additional money whichRolls-Royce have already sought from the Germans for another enginewhich they are developing for them - the M45H.(ix)   The proposals were a package and represented the limits to which the other Governments were prepared to go.3.     V/e concluded our discussions by agreeing that we would report back to our Government on their proposals as amplified in discussionwith us and with officials; they would consider our suggestedvariation about the choice of engine; and we would meet again inLondon on Wednesday next.lie made it clear that we would have to consider the proposals as a whole and our suggested modification of the proposals aboutchoice of engine did not imply any degree of commitment and was notthe only issue between us.4.      Attached as Appendix A is a copy of the proposals stated bythem.   Some of the points dealt with in this paper are not covered in their statement but were explained in discussions with officials.Ministry of Aviation Supply &apos;24th October 1970
^co n f ide n tiaAppendix AA proposal presented by the Governments of France,The Federal German Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlandsto the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland relating jthe A300B Airbus.!Desirous of developing European cooperation in the field ofCivil Aviation manufacture and to avoid unnecessary, costly and,in a word, detrimental duplication of effort, the Governments ofFrance, The Federal German Republic; and the Kingdom of theNetherlands propose to the Government of the United&apos; Kingdom andNorthern Ireland that it should resume its part in the A300BAirbus programme, at the same time abandoning financial or anyother kind of support for the launching of the BAC Jll Airbusprogramme.To this end, they propose the following measurest1)   The British Government accepts the provisions of the franco-German agreement of 29th May 1969 (modified by those of the protocol initialled by the aforementioned three Governments regulating the accession of the Netherlands to the said agreement) and also thedecisions taken up to the present within^ the framework of thisagreement or laid down by the contractors carrying out the programme.2)   The British Government will be represented in the normal way on the official committees set up tinder the agreement of29 May 1969.3)   The programme of work covered by the agreement of29 May 1969 will be completed by the development of the extendedversion, of the pattern of,the B7 version proposed by the contractors, and by carrying out the adaptation work to the airframe which will permit the optional mounting of Rolls-royce engines type RB 211: These extensions bring the fixed-price costof the programme to about 2,3O0mf (195 m ) at the economic conditionsof January 1968, but this figure will have to be clearly defined,as will the exact nature of the work to be carried out beyond the initial 2050 mf (175 m ).4)   Great Britain will finance the A 300 B Airbus programme,completed in the manner just defined, in the same ratiojt as Franceand the Federal German Republic.   Her level of participation will depend upon the amount of the participation of the third parties.Accordingly as Italy and Belgium do or not join in the programme,this level could vary between about 27^ and 30%.   As an indication,A participation of 27% would correspond, at the economic conditionsof January 1968, to a little more than 52 m  for the British share(Government and Contractors) of the development costs, a sharerecoverable over the sale of 36O Aircraft.(confidential)
pential)-2-5)   The Federal German Republic, which is at present financingto the extent of about 18 m  the development work done by hawker siddeley Aviation Ltd. agrees that this amount may fall to be deducted from the British participation, in so far as she obtainsfrom the British Government a guarantee that the 18 m  inconsideration will later by repaid in full, whatever the number ofAjJGOB Airbus finally sold.6)   The share of production work (Airframe and General Assembly)allocated to Great Britain will be as close as possible to herlevel of participation in financing the costs of development.7)   The British contractors cooperating directly in themanufacture of the AJ50OB Airbus Airframe will become members ofAirbus Industrie8)   An intergovernmental agreement, by which the BritishGovernment would accede to the agreement of 29 May 1969 will be concluded within a period of about three months.9)   The work carried out to permit Rolls-Royce engines to be offered as an option on the A3O0B Airbus shall not in any caseinterfere with the development programme of the Bl version fitted with general electric engines.   Similarly, customers shall remainabsolutely free to choose between the two types of engire s proposed.10)   The Government of the Federal German Republic will examineto what extent, within the Framework of off-set agreements which maybe concluded with the United Kingdom, financial assistance might begiven for the development of a more powerful version of the R3211engine, in so far as ths engine would be intended for the A3000BAirbus.11)   The preceding provisions are to be considered as forming a whole and as establishing the limits of what the three Governmentscan propose.(confidential)BBMiiMiWiliiiiiiiiiiwiiiiiwiiiwiiiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiiiiiitiiMiilwiwiiilllllUlillllllllilllllllP.....-M-
