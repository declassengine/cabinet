DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF PIER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(70) 83 COPY NO    *j13 October 1970CABINETFUTURE OF THE NATIONAL BOARD FOR prices and INCOMESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment and ProduclivSty1. I announced to Parliament at the end of July that the future of theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) was being reviewed urgentlyin the context of a wider examination of the work of the monopolies commission and other relevant bodies.    Officials were asked to prepare areport dealing with the policies and institutions required in the whole areaof competition policy and incomes policy.    The Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy (EPC) has now considered this report and has asked me tobring before the Cabinet the issues raised in their discussion.2,        The Committee reached definite conclusions about the future of the nbpi and the institutions needed in the field of incomes.    An announcementis required as a matter of urgency on these institutions and the Committeeasked me to report immediately to the Cabinet on them.    As regardscompetition policy and the future of the Monopolies Commission, theCommittee reached agreement on certain matters but not on others;    we need to announce publicly our intentions at an early date.    But this is somewhat less urgent and I need not ask my colleagues to consider these issues now.3.        The Committee agreed that the NBPI should be wound up as soon as its present work has been completed or transferred to other suitable bodies.A short Bill will be needed for this purpose - preferably introduced at anearly date,    If early legislation were not practicable I should have to let the appointments of Board members and staff run out, but leave the board in formal existence - an untidy position but not impossible,4,        The Committee agreed that there is no need at present for any independent institution for examining the outcome of individual pay settlements either in the public or private sectors.    In the public sectorthere are, however, a number of groups which do not have any negotiating machinery for their remuneration and where there is a need for co-ordinated
advice to the Government.    The Committee agreed therefore that 3 Pay-Review Bodies should be set up to deal respectively with Top Salaries inthe public services, with the Armed Forces, and with doctors and dentists.To ensure that widely differing approaches were not taken by the 3 bodies,there should be a degree of common membership and a common Secretariat.The Review Bodies would be non-statutory and I consider they v/ould best be appointed by the Prime Minister.    There seems to me no need for themto be given any special status, such as standing Royal Commissions.Previous bodies of this kind have had no such status.5.        The Top Salaries Review Body would cover the remuneration of the boards of nationalised industries, the Judiciary, senior civil servants and senior officers of the Armed Forces.    (The special committee dealingwith the pay of the Higher Civil Service would be wound up).    The Ministerof Housing and Local Government has been asked to discuss with localauthorities the possibility of covering also the pay of Chief Executives of major local authorities.6.        The Committee considered whether the Top Salaries Review body should also be asked to advise on the pay of Ministers and Members ofParliament,    The general view of the Committee was that it would bedesirable to have some independent source of advice available on this issue.But there were differing views about the best arrangements for this.    Themajority of the Committee thought it right in principle that the Top salaries review Body should advise on the remuneration of Ministers and Membersof Parliament on a similar basis to the other groups covered.    This would avoid the need for establishing ad hoc machinery for this purpose.    Analternative might be to ask the Secretariat to report on this issue ratherthan the Review Body itself.    If it v/ere decided to use the Top salaries review Body, this could be announced either now or at a later date.    Weshall obviously be under increasing pressure to review the pay of Membersof Parliament in the coming Session.    My own view is that the balance ofadvantage lies in asking the Review Body to advise at, say, four yearly intervals on these matters.    This should be announced at whatever timeseems most appropriate;  it need not be done now.7.        The Secretariat of the 3 Pay Review Bodies would be provided byan &quot;Office of Manpower Economics&quot; which would be established to carry onthat part of the work of the NBPI on incomes which is likely to prove oflasting value.    The Office would continue and develop the analytical and educational role of the NBPI on such general matters as productivitybargaining, wage drift, low pay, in both the public and private sectors.In addition the Office would service such ad hoc committees as are necessary from time to time to examine in depth pay structures and related problems in particular public services.    The Office would make available for thispurpose facilities for investigation and analysis far superior to anything which could be provided on an ad hoc basis.    The Director of the Officeought to be a person of standing in industrial and academic circles, and theOffice should not be part of the official machinery.    But the Director would2
be appointed by the responsible Minister and the programme of work of theOffice would be approved (though not necessarily wholly commissioned) by ministers.    The EPC considered that the creation of a Research Unit ofthis kind would be much preferable to the establishment of the independentCommission on incomes matters.8.        The rest of the work of the NBPI was concerned with the nationalised industries and with prices.    The EPG agreed that these are matters whichshould fall within the field of work of the Monopolies Commission.    Wherecompetition exists, that is the best safeguard for consumers.    Wherecompetition is absent or seriously distorted, and where the level of prices in consequence appears to be unreasonably high, it would be right for the monopolies Commission to be used to investigate the situation and safeguardconsumers.    The arrangements for this will be covered in the further paper which the EPC has asked me to put to Cabinet.9.        The appointment of the members of the NBPI expire at the end ofOctober and it would be most desirable for me to make a statement about thefuture of the Board as soon as Parliament reassembles.    I attach for theinformation of my colleagues an indication of the sort of statement which itseems to me would be appropriate.R department of Employment and Productivity SW113 October 1970
DRAFTFUTURE OF THE NBPIStatement of the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity1. I announced on 23 July that the future of the NBPI was being reviewed in the context of a wider examination covering the work of the monopolies commission and other relevant bodies.    We have now reached the conclusionthat the Board itself should be wound up v/hen the work on which it is atpresent engaged has been completed or transferred to other appropriatebodies.    Legislation will be introduced in due course.2.        In the public sector there is a clear need for co-ordinated machineryfor advising the Government on the remuneration of certain groups for whomno negotiating machinery is, for one reason or another, appropriate.    TheGovernment intends therefore to establish at an early date 3 Review Bodieswith a degree of interlocking membership.    One will advise on the remuneration p  the Boards of nationalised industries, the Judiciary, senior civil servants, senior officers of the Armed Forces and such other groupsas might be appropriately considered with them.    Another will take over from the NBPI responsibility for advising on the pay of the Armed Forcesgenerally.   A third will advise on the remuneration of doctors and dentistsin the National Health Service.    The Review Bodies will have at their disposal a Secretariat provided by a new Office of Manpower Economics.3,        The Office of Manpower Economics will be established to take overand develop the analytical and educational role of the NBPI on generalmatters affecting pay and its relation to productivity.    This is the work ofthe NBPI in the incomes field which has by common consent been of lastingvalue.    The Government intends to use the Office to service any ad hocenquiries which are necessary from time to time to examine in depth paystructures and related problems in.the public services.    The Office will notbe part of the Government machine, and its reports will be independent.Its programme of work will, however, be approved, though not necessarilyentirely commissioned, by Ministers.4
4,        The Government is considering how best to strengthen and develop the work of the Monopolies Commission and a statement on this will bemade at an early date.    The Government considers that a strengthenedMonopolies Commission will be the appropriate body to consider any caseswhere in conditions of monopoly or restricted competition, prices appearto be set at levels which are contrary to the public interest.5
