113 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 77 COPY no October 1970CABINETAIRBUSES AND THE RB211 ENGINEMemorandum by the Minister of technology, The summary and conclusions in the paper by officials (CP(70) 74)bring out the conflicting and difficult issues which face us. The Cabinetmay find it helpful to have my views, as the Minister responsible, on the issues as I see them.2,        The first issue concerns the kind of aircraft industry we want to see in Europe and the part we want the British aircraft industry (at present themost powerful in Europe) to play in it.    On this I find myself in complete agreement with the views of the Foreign Secretary as expressed inparagraph 3 of his minute of 7 October 1970.    The French, German, andother European Governments clearly attach great importance to the concept of a European aircraft industry as being worthwhile in itself and the only way of avoiding American domination in this field.3.        The BAG 311 and the RB211-S1 offer the best prospect of maintainingan effective base for enabling us to play our full part in a European industry.Without the design capability, skills, organisation and experience of theBritish Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Rolls-Royce, we should be weakerand Europe also,    The balance of advantage is clearly against furtherinvolvement in the A300B,    Hawker Siddeley are already partners in thatproject.    It would not provide an adequate basis for launching the RB211-61and it is difficult to see what advantages we could gain to compensate forthe damage done to our own industry (BAG and Rolls-Royce in particular).Government re-entry would involve substantial expenditure withoutcommensurate advantage.4.        I recognise that to undertake the BAC 311 and RB211-61 and Concordewill make it very difficult for me to meet my public expenditure targets for1974-75 but a decision on the BAC 311 must be taken now and I am sure itwould be wrong to accept now all the consequences of abandoning the projectbecause of our Inability to predict the outcome of the joint Anglo/Frenchreview of Concorde in March.    The public expenditure implications of the concorde decision must be faced at the time the decision has to be made,
secret. In any event we must decide on the support that should be given toRolls-Royce so that they can complete development of the R3211-22 andfulfil their contract with Lockheed,,    I will explain orally to my colleagues the difficulties now facing Rolls-R.oyce,    Their difficulties are due in part to poor management and financial controls  important steps have alreadybeen taken to improve matters but further action will be necessary.6,        Both BAG and Rolls-Royce now require our decisions quickly.    I am sure, however, that if we decide for the BAG 311, the Foreign secretary will wish for time to explain our reasons to the French and german governments.    I am myself due to see M Mondon on 20 October aboutConcorde; there would be great advantage in settling our Airbus policybefore that date.7.        In my judgment, the BAG 311 should be supported both on its own merits and as an essential foundation for the future.    Success cannot be guaranteed, but the potential prizes are great, and in a much wider contextthan the projects themselves.J DMinistry of Technology SW19 October 19702
