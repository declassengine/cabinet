DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT56CP(70) 94 COPY NO27 October 1970CABINETRATE SUPPORT grant memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, In my paper on rate support grant (CP(70) 69) I undertook to bring before Cabinet at the end of October proposals for the statutory negotiationswith the local authority associations.2, After detailed joint study by Departments and the local authority associations of the trends in expenditure in various services and of the factors influencing expendituret forecasts have been made of theexpenditure which authorities could in aggregate be expected to incurin 1971-72 and 1972-73,    For most services some growth will arise from demographic and other external factors without allowing for improve-ment in standards although it is not always possible to separate thevarious elements of growth.    The local authority associations have indicated for the different services the rates of growth which tfcsywould consider a reasonable projection of existing policies although they would argue that in most cases there is public pressure for fasterimprovement to which authorities would like to accede.    The associations&apos;figures are called in this paper &quot;1. a0 bids&quot;0    Departments in generalconsider that somewhat lower levels of expenditure would be defensibleand could be sustained without detriment to the services.    It might bepossible to operate services at an even lower level, still allowing forsome small improvements in standard of service, but departments would consider this unreasonable.    The question which I have toconsider under the Act is the need for developing oei ,icco and theextent to which,, having regard to general economic conditions, itis reasonable to develop them,3,        In the following paragraphs I discuss first the trends of expenditurebefore taking account of the special measures agreed by Cabinet forincreased charges for school meals, increase in further educationfees and for a general squeeze on expenditure.    These are brought in at the end of the computations which are illustrated in the tablesin Annex L1
4. The ls a, bids for the various services would produce aggregateexpenditure in rate support grant terms of  3?662 million in 1971-72 and 3,867 million in 1972-73 in terms of prices current at 30 June 1970,These produce rates of growth in rate support grant expenditure termsof 5S 7 per cent and 5. 6 per cent compared with the 5. 2 per cent in eachyear which, as I explained in my previous paper, is implied by the figures in the situation reports5.        These 10 a, bids are not, in general, excessive.    Indeed the HomeOffice believe that for police, traffic wardens and associated civilianstaff a greater increase in numbers than the local authority associationsthink could be achieved would be both feasible and very desirable.    On theother hand, in the context of the need to restrain public expenditure,Departments are satisfied that for most other services somewhat lowerfigures would be defensible,    Details of the reductions are given in annex 1 and in the notes on the main services in Annex 2,    They amount in total to reductions in rate support grant expenditure terms of 38 million in 1971-72 and  54 million in 1972-73 leading to figuresof expenditure for rate support grant purposes of  3, 624 million and 3,814 million^    The rates of growth in rate support grant terms are thus reduced to 4, 6 per cent and 5. 3 per cent respectively.6,        As I explained in my previous paper (CP(70) 69) rate support grant figures need adjustments to produce the public expenditure equivalentand also require a price correction to make them comparable with thefigures in the public expenditure situation report,,    These changes to theI, a. bids produce  2,968 million for 1971-72 and  3,121 million for 1972-73compared with the allowance made in the situation report (after runningtally adjustments but before taking account of the special measuresmentioned in paragraph 3) of  2,956 million and  3,098 million.    The1, a, bids are therefore  12 million and  23 million above the existingpublic expenditure estimates for these two years^7.        Putting the departments  figures into public expenditure formproduces  2,932 million and  30070 million which are  24 million and 28 million below those in the public expenditure situation report.    Thusif local authority expenditure is restrained to these levels these are thepublic expenditure savings which will be realised -^.1 addition to all th ;other measures that Cabinet has already considered.    The rates of growth in public expenditure terms would then be 4 per cent in 1971-72 - precisely the rate stated in our p?redecessorsI White Paper on Public Expenditure1968-69 to 1973-74 (Crand, 4234) as the rate which would be regarded asan acceptable basis for the next rate support grant determination - and487 per cent in 1972-73.    The rates compare with 4,8 per cent in eachyear implied by the situation report,,
4S The 10 a0 bids for the various services would produce aggregateexpenditure in rate support grant terms of  3,66B million in 1971-72 and 3,867 million in 1972-73 in terms of prices current at 30 June 1970.These produce rates of growth in rate support grant expenditure termsof 50 7 per cent and 5. 6 per cent compared with the 5. 2 per cent in eachyear which, as I explained in my previous paper, is implied by the figures in the situation reports5. These 10 a, bids are not, in general, excessive,,    Indeed the HomeOffice believe that for police, traffic wardens and associated civilianstaff a greater increase in numbers than the local authority associationsthink could be achieved would be both feasible and very desirable.    On theother hand, in the context of the need to restrain public expenditure.Departments are satisfied that for most other services somewhat lowerfigures would be defensible,    Details of the reductions are given in annex 1 and in the notes on the main services in Annex 2,    They amount in total to reductions in rate support grant expenditure terms of 38 million in 1971-72 and  54 million in 1972-73 leading to figuresof expenditure for rate support grant purposes of  3, 624 million and 3,814 million.    The rates of growth in rate support grant terms are thus reduced to 4. 6 per cent and 50 3 per cent respectively.6a        As I explained in my previous paper (CP(70) 69) rate support grant figures need adjustments to produce the public expenditure equivalentand also require a price correction to make them comparable with thefigures in the public expenditure situation reports    These changes to the1. a. bids produce  2,968 million for 1971-72 and  3,121 million for 1972-73compared with the allowance made in the situation report (after runningtally adjustments but before taking account of the special measuresmentioned in paragraph 3) of  2,956 million and  3,098 million.    The1, a,, bids are therefore  12 million and  23 million above the existingpublic expenditure estimates for these two years^7.        Putting the departments  figures into public expenditure formproduces  2,932 million and  3S070 million which are  24 million and 28 million below those in the public expenditure situation report.    Thusif local authority expenditure is restrained to these levels these are thepublic expenditure savings which will be reality a ^i a diUon to all thother measures that Cabinet has already considered.    The rates of grov/thin public expenditure terms would then be 4 per cent in 1971-72 - precisely the rate stated in our predecessors1 V/hite Paper on Public Expenditure1968-69 to 1973-74 (Cmnd, 4234) as the rate which would be regarded asan acceptable basis for the next rate support grant determination - and4S 7 per cent in 1972-73.    The rates compare with 4. 8 per cent in eachyear implied by the situation report.
8.     Allowance can now be made for the special measures decided by cabinet.    The reductions in education expenditure in England and Walesattributable to the increased charges for school meals and for further education together amount to  21 million in 1971-72 and  24 million in1972-73.    As I explained in my previous paper the savings from dis-continuing free milk for some primary school-children cannot be takeninto account in advance of the legislation,     3 million in each year willbe added as the local authority share of the extra expenditure for health and welfare services approved by Cabinet (CM(70) 26th Conclusions,Minute 3).9.      1. 5 million also has to be added in 1972-73 for the costs arisingfrom a change of status of some voluntary approved schools but this isonly a transfer from another public expenditure sub-head and is not a netaddition.10.     Cabinet also decided (CM(70) 24th Conclusions, Minute 2) that ageneral squeeze should be applied to local authority expenditure inGreat Britain to try to produce savings of  20 million in 1971-72 and 25- 30 million by 1974-75.    In view of the substantial unexpected publicsavings shown in paragraph 7 above derived from detailed slimming of thelocal authority proposals I do not think that we would be justified in making such a severe general squeeze as well.     I propose, therefore, that Ishould seek from a general increase in efficiency by local authorities inEngland and Wales an unallocated reduction of  10 million in 1971-72 and 15 million in 1972-73.    The effect would be that in place of savings of 20 million and  25 million from a general squeeze (before specific measures) we obtain savings of  34 million and  43 million from the combination of a smaller unallocated squeeze and reduction in individual services.    I therefore invite Cabinet to revise their previous decision ona general squeeze accordingly.i i11.    After all these adjustments the figures of relevant expenditure for rate support grant purposes would be  3596 million in 1971-72 and 3779 million in 1972-73 with rates of growth of 3. 8 per cent and5.1 per cent,12.    Cabinet approved (CM(70) 27th Conclusions, Minute 3) rates of grant of 57lr per cent and 58 per cent for the two years.    The grantoffered to local authorities would therefore be  2068 million in .1971-72and  2192 million in 1972-73.13,    An estimate has been made of the probable average rate poundageimplied by these figures of expenditure and grant.    Such an estimateinvolves assumptions that authorities themselves will make in fixingrates and the actual results will also be affected by the extent to whichauthorities decide to draw upon or to augment balances.    The estimateindicates increases in normal rate poundage of ,1s. 2d in 1971-72 andIs. 4d in 1972-73 compared with the earlier estimate in my previouspaper of &quot;at least Is. 3d&quot;..    The corresponding increases for domestic rate payers, which will be reduced by the small increases in domesticelement of grant which Cabinet also approved, would be lid and Is. 2drespectively.
14.     My intention in negotiations with, the local authority associationswill be to reach agreement on figures not exceeding those set out inparagraph 11 above as ths expenditure upon which grant should be based.However, to allow for unexpected factors which may arise in thenegotiations I seek authority from Cabinet to settle at up to  10 millionabove those figures without further reference to Cabinet if I and mycolleagues who are associated in the negotiations are satisfied that thisis essential.15.     The negotiations will take place in terms of figures calculated onthe basis of 30th June 1970 prices and before the Rate Support GrantOrder is presented to Parliament the figures will be adjusted to take account of increases in prices, costs and remuneration which haveccccsrieed earage tfea^.   If the manual worker claim has been settled by mid-November I shall include an allowance for it in these adjustments;but if the level of the settlement is higher than we think appropriate itwould be open to me to provide for part only of it.Conclusions16.     I therefore invite Cabinet to agree;-(I)that the aim of the negotiations should be to reach agreement on figures of expenditure on which rate support grant will be based not exceeding  3596 million in 1971-72 and  3779 million in 1972-73; but(ii)that I should have discretion, without further referenceto Cabinet, to exceed each of these limits by  10 million.P w department of the Environment, SWl26 October 19704

NOTES    1.3.k.5.Allows for increased higher education fees and schoolmeal prices but not for reduced provision of milk. 3m in each year from extra expenditure on health and welfare authorised by Cabinet.Expenditure of  1.5m in 1972/3 arising from change ofstatus of approved schools has been included under&quot;measures&quot; rather than under &quot;Working Group Forecast&quot;since it arises from a change of policy by theGovernment, not from any increased activity by theauthorities.   The increase in local authority expenditure has no net effect on public expenditure - it is simplya transfer from one head to another.Reductions for &quot;general squeeze&quot; on Local Authorityspending. Amounts agreed by Cabinet were  20 m and 25 - 30m.; but these have been reduced because of increased savings elsewhere:   see para.   10      ofThe 1970/1 forecasts are those made at the time of the1968 Order (amended for price changes).    There is some evidence that while the total out-turn is likely to be broadly in line, there may be significant adjustmentsbetween services.   In particular, out-turn on transport is likely to be higher than forecast while out-turnon Miscellaneous Local Services is likely to be lower.These variations account for the apparent exceptionalrate of growth in the two services in 1971/2,3.

NOTES ON THE MAIN SERVICESDepartment of Education and Sciencetale the bids by authorities for expenditure on education are Ingeneral in line with DES forecasts, a few of their claims are, inthe Department&apos; s view, either unnecessary or over-stated, and justifysome reduction in the authorities&apos; total figures.   While the authoritieshave sought a growth rate of k% in the improvement factor for non-teaching costs for schools and further education in both years theDepartment is prepared to regard a rate of 3i% in 1971/2 and k% in1972/3 as acceptable, given on the one hand the need to compensate for the check on standards resulting from the last RSG- settlement,and on the other hand, that the forecasts provide for continuing pro-gress towards the achievement of satisfactory pupil/teacher ratios inthe schools.    The result is a total reduction in local authorities8forecasts by  10m and  20m in 1971/2 and 1972/3 respectively.2,    Department of Health and Social security the Local Authorities&apos; bids for Health and Welfare assume rates of growth of the order of 5% for Health and lk% for Welfare in the period under consideration.   DHSS consider that some of these bids representdevelopment that is unlikely to be attained in this period, while they accept in full some others.    Overall,, they propose rates of developmentof about k% per annum for Health and about 11^ per annum for Welfare.3.    Home OfficePoliceThe local authority proposals provide for increases in each year of2,500 policemen, 800 traffic wardens and 1,500 civilians and cadets.The Home Office consider larger increases to be desirable and attainable,namely 3,h00 policemen, 2,000 traffic wardens and 2,760 civilians inthe first year, at an additional cost of  2.9m; and 3*850 policemen,2,000 traffic wardens and 3*025 civilians and cadets in the second year, at an additional cost of  6.5m.    As the aim is to secure a rapid increase in police strength to bring it nearer to the authorisedestablishment, it may be necessary, for the purpose of police grant,to make vote provision for higher increases than those proposed by thelocal authority associations.Fire service the local authority proposals provide for reasonable increases in thestrength of the fire service, and for  2m and  3m in 1971/72 and 1972/73inimplementing the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on the?ire Service.    The department consider that, for the latter purpose,expenditure at about half this rate could be tolerable.
coChild careThe local authority proposals provide for a growth rate of 7% a year,associated with an expected growth in the number of children in care,likely changes in their distribution among the different forms of care, increases in the number of child care officers and an improve-ment of standards in local authority homes.    Allowance is made also for a change in the financial arrangements of numbers of approvedschools and remand homes in the second year, when they are expectedto be absorbed in the community homes system.    The department considersthat a marginal reduction in the rate of growth would be reasonable.probation and after-care&apos;il &apos;Provision is made for increases foreseen under existing arrangements in the number of probation officers.&apos;?rban programmeProvision is made for developments already announced and no change is proposed.Other Home Office servicesApart from expenditure on civil defence, which reflects a continuation of the &quot;care and maintenance&quot; arrangements, provision for other HomeOffice services is determined largely by factors such as the increas-ing work-load on the courts and (for electoral registration) theestimated population of voting age0   Reductions would be hard to achieve.h.    Ministry of TransportiHighways, Lighting. Parking, Road Safety etc the bulk of this expenditure is on the maintenance of roads; localauthorities are wholly responsible for maintenance of roads otherthan trunk roads.    The level of expenditure allowed in the previousbiennium reflected the reductions, particularly in maintenance expenditure on minor roads, requested by the previous Administrationfollowing devaluation.    The outturn figures for 1968-69 and 1969-70show that, overall, no reduction in highway expenditure was achievedalthough, there were reductions, in constant price terms, on someheads including a small one on Maintenance; local authorities had clearly decided to economise&apos;elsewhere rather than cut expenditureon roads.   By 1970-71 local authorities expect to exceed in constant price terms the level of expenditure on maintenance reached in 1967-68 - a year when there was no restriction of expenditure on maintenanceWhile the Ministry of Transport had been expecting a recovery fromthe reduced levels &apos;allowed&apos; for the previous two years, the factthat local authorities have felt unable to reduce their maintenance&quot;expenditure means that their proposals for 1971-72 and 1972-73 starttherefore from a higher base.    Moreover the Marshall Report onHighway Maintenance, soon to be published, will undoubtedly justifysome additional expenditure which will need to be reflected in the ,figures allowed for the next two years.,    The department&apos;s figuresa small allowance for this.2
The local authorities will probably be content to accept Ministryfigures for capital expenditure on non-principal roads which were cut as part of the Public Expenditure operation.5.     Ministry of Housing and Local Government services the forecasts of expenditure on these services provide for littlemore than the continued growth necessary to meet additional demandsarising from increased population and foreseeable development.    growth of the sewerage service is closely related to the availability ofcapital expenditure, and although the local authorities would have preferred to see greater expansion, over the 1.5% p.a. proposed, theydid not press this.    The forecast is sufficient to cover the serviceof new housing, industry and commercial development together withreplacements and improvements needed to prevent serious risks to public health.    Much the same considerations apply to the refusecollection and disposal service, where the inevitable increased use for incineration and pulverisation methods also adds to the cost ofthe service.Expenditure on other public health services growing at 5?% as proposedby the Department is considered sufficient to maintain standards,despite the local authority view that this would,require a rate of growth nearer 6-$%, and the forecasts refleot the view that capitalexpenditure on public baths will continue to be restricted and theyallow for the temporary decline in the clean air programme.   On theother hand, higher land drainage precepts, which are outside localauthorities&apos; control, appear to be inescapable.Among the amenity services, parks and open spaces are expected toshow continued growth but a rather slower rate than in the years upto 1968-69* a year when there was no growth because of post-devalua-tion restrictions.    The growth in expenditure on town and country planning has also shown a marked decline in real terms over the lasttwo years.   Although the local authorities held strongly that thiswas because of special circumstances and that growth would continue at a rate approaching 6% per annum, the Departments forecasts allow for a slower rate of growth even after taking account of the extraburdens on local planning authorities as a result of changes in the planning system.Provision has been made for a relatively rapid increase - around 11%in each year - in relevant expenditure on housing, particularlyimprovement grants, as a result of the changes authorised by theHousing Act 1969.   hExpenditure allocated to general administration has been affected byprofessional recommendations in favour of maximum allocation of administrative expenses to&apos;particular services.    The local authorities&apos;view is that these recommended changes have already had their effect and that residual administrative expenditure will now grow at a ratecommensurate with the growth uin general activities of local authorities the department&apos;s forecasts reflect the view that these two opposinginfluences on residual expenditure will balance in 1971-72 and thata low rate of growth will appear in the following year.^_3._(confidential)
