DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 government cp(70) 97 COPY NO      d27 October 1970CABINETFUTURE OF THE NATIONAL. BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMESNote by the Secretary of State for employment, When the Cabinet discussed my paper on this subject on15 October 1970 I was asked to revise the draft statement in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretaryof State for Social Services (CM(70) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5).    I am now attaching a revised statement which I circulate to my colleagues and towhich no amendments have been suggested.    As agreed by Cabinet I amplanning to make this statement on Monday, 2 November.2. I have also been discussing with my colleagues directly concerned the timing of the announcements about the pay of the Judiciary and the senior officers of the Armed Forces.    The latter was referred to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes who are responsible for advisingus on the pay of the Armed Services and the Board has now reported.    no time is ever convenient for announcements of large pay increases to public servants.    I am Inclined to think, however, that on balance the best solution would be for the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Defence to announce the increases in answer to Written Questions on 2 November,making the point that in future these matters will not be considered in isolation but by the Top Salaries Review Body.3. There will undoubtedly be unfavourable comment on the absolutesize of these increases at a time when we are engaged on a struggle tohold down the size of the pay increases given to so many lower paid workersin the public services and the nationalised industries.    But unless we areto put off the announcement for several months, I do not think there is anything to be gained from any short term postponement,R department of Employment SW127 October 1970
FUTURE OF THE NATIONAL, BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMESStatement by the Secretary of State for Employment&apos;\ \\1, I announced on 23 July that the future of the National Board for prices and Incomes was being reviewed in the context of a widerexamination covering the work of the Monopolies Commission and other relevant bodies.    We have now reached the conclusion that the Board itself should be wound up when the work on which it is at present engaged has beencompleted.    Legislation will be introduced in due course,2,        In the public sector there is a clear need for co-ordinated machineryfor advising the Government on the remuneration of certain groups for whom no negotiating machinery is, for one reason or another, appropriate.The Government Intends therefore to establish at an early date threeReview Bodies with a degree of interlocking membership.    One will advise on the remuneration of the Boards of nationalised industries, the Judiciary,senior civil servants, senior officers of the Armed Forces and such other groups as might be appropriately considered with them.   Another will advise on the pay of the Armed Forces generally.   A third will advise onthe remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service.The Review Bodies will have at their disposal and working to theirdirections a Secretariat provided by a new Office of Manpower Economics.3.        The Government also intends to use the Office to service any ad hocenquiries which are necessary from time to time to examine in depthparticular pay structures and related problems.    The Office will also carryout analytical and educational work on more general matters affecting pay and its relation to productivity, either at the request of Ministers or, withthe approval of Ministers.    The Office will not be part of the government machine and its reports will be Independent,4.        The Government is considering how best to strengthen and develop the work of the Monopolies Commission and a statement on this will be madeat an early date.
