Annex2DRAFT SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT ON DEFENCE POLICY 1970INTRODUCTION1.     Since it took office in June the Government has:a0     critically examined the state of the Armed forces and the defence programme it inherited;&quot;b,,     reviewed defence objectives and priorities;c.     acted to fulfil its undertakings&apos;on defence;d0     settled future levels of defence expenditure aspart of its general review of public expenditure.2.    The Government is determined to restore britain&apos;s security to the high place it must take among national priorities^and tomake good as far as possible the damage of successive defencereviews.   There are three objectives:a,     to enable Britain to resume, within her resources,a proper share of responsibility for the preservation-tion of peace and stability in the world;b0     to improve the capabilities of the Armed. Forces,overcome their manpower difficulties and enhancetheir role in the community;c.     to establish and maintain a sound financial basis on which to develop and carry out defence policyand plane in the years ahead.3.     This statement summarises the strategic priorities and sets out the major decisions which the Government has already takento meet its objectives.   The decisions cover:/ a.
a. a military contribution to five Power defence arrangements in South East Asia;b. ROYAL NAVY:   Aircraft carriers;Anti-snip guided-weapon systems;c. ARMY:    Structure of the Regular Army;Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve(T. &amp; A.V.R.);d. ROYAL AIR PORCS:   JAGUAR close support aircraft;e. Defence Budget levels.STRATEGIC PRIORITIESk*    The security of Britain rests on the strength, of the north atlantic Alliance.   The maintenance and improvement of our military contribution to NATO remains the first priority ofdefence policy.   Britain will continue to co-operate with her allies in order to enable the European members of the Allianceto contribute a fuller and more effective share to the common defence burden.5.     But there are also serious threats to stability outside the nato area.   Britain will be willing to play her part in counteringthem by continuing:a. to honour her obligations for the protection ofBritish territories overseas and those to whomshe owes a special duty by treaty or otherwise;b. to support the efforts of the United. Nations and/ otherconfidential
kother international authorities working to eliminate the sources: of conflict between nations and to promote disarmament;c.     to support CENTO and SEATO.6.    The Government intends in addition:a. to contribute to 5-Power Commonwealth defence arrangements relating to Malaysia and Singapore;b. to continue discussions with leaders in the Gulfand other interested countries on how Britain can best contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in the area.FIVE POWER DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS7a     Britain has long-standing associations with the commonwealth countries of South East Asia and she shares their interest inthe stability of the area.   The Government believes that thetotal withdrawal of forces planned by the previous administration would have weakened the security of Malaysia and Singapore;    andthat a continuing British military presence on the spot will havean important deterrent value and a stabilising influence.   It has there fore proposed to the four Commonwealth Governments ofAustralia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore that Five Powerdefence arrangements should be established as soon as possible,which would include a contribution of British forces.8.    These arrangements would be based on a political commitment/ of a(confidential)
5of a consultative nature undertaken equally by all Five Powers,which would relate to the defence of Malaysia and Singaporeagainst external attack.   They would replace the bilateral Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreement.9,    The Commonwealth Governments concerned have warmly welcomed the British intention to maintain a military presence in the area and the contribution of forces which the Government has proposed.They have agreed to join in working out the new political arrange-meats which will replace the Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreement.A meeting of Ministers of the five Governments is planned for next year,10.   The British contribution as a whole is broadly designed, to complement the forces of the other four Governments.   It will comprise:a.     five frigates or destroyers on station East of suez (including Hong Kong);ba     a British battalion group, including an airplatoon and an artillery battery;c.     a detachment of NIMROD long-range maritimereconnaissance aircraft;a number of WHIRLWIND helicopters.The provision of a submarine is also being considered.   Therewill also be a considerable number of visits by combat units for all three Services for jungle, air and maritime training and exercises in the area.
Confidential)611,   The annual extra cost of deploying these forces in SouthEast Asia is likely to he between  5m. and  10m. (budgetary and overseas expenditure).   A more precise estimate cannot be made until further studies and consultation,relating for example to possible joint support arrangements with the forces of the other commonwealth partners, have been completed.   The effects on NATOforce declarations will be small;   they will be the subject of consultation with NATO.ROYAL NAVY12.   The plan of the previous Administration to phase out the fixed-wing aircraft carriers in 1972 would create a most seriousgap in the capability of the Fleet.   The Government will reducethat gap in two ways:a. the strike capability of surface ships will be improved by introducing as soon as possible asurface-launched anti-ship guided-missile system,EXOCET;b. H.M.S. ARK ROYAL will be retained until the late1970s.Anti-Ship Guided-Weapon Systems13.   The French EXOCET missile system is in an advanced stage ofdevelopment.   Negotiations have started with the FrenchGovernment with a view to establishing an Anglo/French collabora-tive programme.   Subject to their satisfactory conclusion, it is/ intended
7intended: that the EXOCET system should he widely fitted insurface ships during the 1970s.Studies, continue on other means of enhancing the capability of the Fleet against surface ships, including submarine-launchedanti-ship missile systems.Aircraft Carriers15.   Two fixed-wing aircraft carriers remain in commission in theRoyal Navy:   H.M.S. ARK ROYAL and H.M.S. EAGLE.   The Governmenthas decided to retain H.M.S. ARK ROYAL and to run her on as a fixed-wing aircraft carrier until the late 1970s.   By thenimproved weapon systems planned for the Fleet including EXOCETare expected to he in, or coming into, service on a wide scalejand the new cruisers will he starting to become available,capable of operating V/STOL aircraft if further study shows thattheir provision would be effective and give value for money.During the interim years H.M.S, ARK ROYAL&apos;s embarked PHANTOM andBUCCANEER aircraft will provide an invaluable complement to thesupport supplied by shore-based aircraft to naval forces at sea.Her presence will alleviate the shortfall in the weapon capability of the Fleet.   It will also offer a substantial reinforcement of NATO&apos;s maritime strength.   The provision of the extra manpowerfor H.M.S. ARK ROYAL after 1972 will not require any immediatechanges in the current naval programme;   but H.M.S. LION willnot now be converted to the helicopter-carrying role.16.   This decision will ensure that the large capital sum&apos; !!/ invested(confidential)       ^^^^^^^
o8invested in H.M.S. ARK ROYAL&apos;s recent refit will not be wasted.But in view of the serious manpower difficulties and the potentialcost, the Government has decided against any extension of the life of H.M.S. EAGLE.    She will serve as planned until 1972,operating SEA VIXEN and BUCCANEER aircraft.17.   It is not planned to replace H.M.S. ARK ROYAL with anotherfixed-wing carrier.   The Royal Air Force will still assume responsibility for providing fixed-wing air support for the royal navy from shore bases;   but the full implementation of this taskwill be more gradual.   The aircraft for H.M.S. ARK ROYAL will beprovided from the total numbers already planned;   and the maximumuse will be made of planned Royal Air Force facilities for their maintenance and support.   The aircraft embarked in H.M.S, ARKROYAL will be flown in the main by Royal Naval aircrew, but RoyalAir Force aircrew will participate as necessary.   Some adjustmentwill be made to the rundown of Fleet Air Arm officers and ratings,but recruitment for fixed-wing flying will not be re-opened.18.   The nation can be proud of the highly professional way inwhich the Army is carrying out the task of helping to keep thepeace in Northern Ireland.   But the Army is seriously short ofthe men that lit needs..   The plan of the previous administration was to run down units with great traditions to a point thatwould have left a sadly inadequate provision for unforeseenTHE ARMY/ commitments;(confide mtsmT)
9commitments;   and the T. &amp; A.V.R. has been so reduced that it nolonger includes any uncommitted, reserve.19.   The Northern Ireland situation illustrates the difficultiescausedi by the shortage and undermanning of Regular units.   there reinforcements there reached their peak last July, when therewere no fewer than thirteen major units in the infantry rolecompared with two infantry battalions before 196$).   Since therewas insufficient provision for unforeseen commitments of thiskind, the task has had to be shared among units already committed to other essential duties.20.   The Government has now decided:a. to halt the rundown   of major units of the british army to the extent that the manpower shortagespermit;b. to retain the Brigade of Gurkhas;c. to expand the T. &amp; A.V.R. in order to make provisionfor an uncommitted reserve of formed units of trained men and to increase the contribution of reserve forces to NATO.Army Structure21.   The Government would have preferred to cancel the second phase of the reduction of major Army units.   But, after carefullyreviewing the manpower situation, it reluctlantly concluded thatthere was no alternative to proceeding with the   rundown   subjectto two important changes:/ a.
10a*     the tenth major unit reduction, envisaged as apossible supplement to the second phase, willnot take place;b,     the plans have been modified to provide one additional air-portable squadron in the RoyalArmoured Corps;   one additional Royal EngineerSquadron at reduced strength;    six infantrycompanies;   and later, it is hoped, one additionalRoyal Artillery Battery.   These units will be ofgreat value in carrying out essential duties bothin this country and overseas;    they will be a nucleus for potential expansion in the future.Most of these will also, at their own wish, enablethe names of famous regiments to be retained.The Gurkhas v22.   The Government has decided to remove the uncertainty created&quot;by the previous Administration about the future of the Brigade ofGurkhas.   The Brigade will remain in being with either k or 5Gurkha infantry battalions.   Its precise organisation, includingsupporting services, is still being considered.   The greater partof the Brigade will continue to be stationed in the Far East;&quot;but it is planned to deploy one battalion to the United Kingdom.The retention of the Gurkha Brigade will materially assist in relieving the general strain upon infantry resources and givethe Army a greater degree of flexibility in meeting its commitmentsboth in and outside Europe./ Territorial
11Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve23.   The Government has completed its review of the role and size of the T. &amp; A.V.R..   The present units of the T. &amp; A.V.R. have important tasks;    they are well organised, well equipped and well trained.   But there are too few trainedi men available tosupport the Regular Forces in time of crisis.,   The size of theT. &amp; A.V.R. is too closely tailored to specific requirements and.takes no account of the need for an uncommitted reserve,available for unforeseen contingencies.21+.   The Government has decided that the provision of such areserve should be one of the roles of the T, &amp; A.V.R.   Furtherunits will therefore be established for this purpose.   They willbe mainly infantry units, but may include units of other armsand corps.   They will be given modern equipment, though onlighter scales than those T. &amp; A.V.R. units which need to be immediately available to fight alongside regular forces inB.A.O.R. and in the United Kingdom Mobile Force.25.   It has also been decided to increase the contribution of reserve forces to NATO by the formation of an additionalTs &amp; A.V.R. Armoured Car Regiment.26.   The details of these decisions remain to be worked out.Discussions will be opened immediately with the Council ofT.A, &amp; V.R. Associations and with the Associations themselves.The new units will be established in T. &amp; A.V.R. Group &apos;A&apos; andtheir members will have the same call-out liability and dress/ as
12as those in existing Group &quot;A&apos; units.   The training requirementand hence the training obligation   for units other than the armoured. Car Regiment has not yet been decided in detail, butit might be somewhat less.   The expansion will be gradual;    anuncommitted reserve of around 10,000 men is initially planned.The Government is confident that there will be a vigorous response from those who would like to devote some of their spare timeto voluntary service for the defence of the community.ROYAL AIR FORCE27.   The two most pressing problems of the Royal Air Force are:a. the gap in tactical strike reconnaissance capa-bilityjb. a general shortage of front-line aircraft, both for combat and support, particularly in Germany.Multi-Role Combat Aircraft28.   For tactical strike and reconnaissance especially, theMulti-Role Combat Aircraft is planned to meet future needs andto form a major part of the front-line strength of the RoyalAir Force.   The Government announced in July its decision toenter upon the initial stage of development with the GermanGovernment.   The Italian Governments recent confirmation thatit will continue to participate in the project is moat welcome.This is an important example of European co-operation in defence procurement./ JAGUAR
13JAGUAR Close Support Aircraft29.   There is a particular shortage of close support aircraft.The Memorandum of Understanding with the French Governmentenvisages production of 200 JAGUAR supersonic aircraft for each country.   Development of the aircraft is proceeding well andinitial production orders have heen placed.    It was intended that the Royal Air Force should take two versions of the aircraft:a single seat operational version which would replace the PHANTOMin the close support role when the PHANTOM takes over the air defence task from the LIGHTNING in the mid-1970s, and a twinseat trainer to replace the GNAT and the HUNTER for the advancedtraining of pilots who will fly fast jet aircraft.   A searchingreview has &quot;been made of flying training plans with the aim of releasing resources to strengthen the front line while maintaining the essential high, standards of training.30.   In the light of this review the Government has decided:a.     to replace the GNAT and the HUNTER with a new       .,jet trainer less sophisticated and less expensivethan the JAGUAR;d,     to increase, without reducing the total purchase ofJAGUAR aircraft for the Royal Air Force, the numbers to be built of the operational version in order to augment the JAGUAR front-line, as currently planned,by four squadrons.31.   Consideration is still being given to the best choice of a/ number
1hnumber of possible ways of meeting the requirement for a new jettrainer;    a small number of JAGUAR trainers will still be requiredfor operational conversion and squadron training.52.   The additional JAGUAR aircraft in the Royal Air Force close support force will constitute a substantial increase in Britain9scontribution to NATO in this important role.MANPOWER33.   The revised plans of all three Services have had to take account of the present serious deficiencies in manpower.   Thestrength of the Armed Forces (United Kingdom personnel) on 1 April1970 was 373,000.   This was 18,300 (or nearly 5 per cent) belowthe number required at that time to meet the previous Administra-tion&apos;s defence programme.   The shortage resulted from a levelof recruitment insufficient to support even the declining forcestrengths needed to fulfil that programme.   The number of maleother ranks recruits for the three Services fell disastrouslyfrom nearly h0,000 in 1966-67 *o 32,000 in 1967-68 and 28,000in 1968-69.   There was a welcome improvement in recruitment in1969-70 to 3h,000, but this was still 12*000 (or one-quarter)short of what the Forces needed to make up for the previousshortfall.34.   There should be a further improvement this year, but therewill still be considerable leeway to make up.   Even when pastdeficits have been made good, the Services have a steady long/ term(confidential)
15term requirement for something in excess of U0,000 other ranksevery year.   In addition to the shortfall in other rank recruitingall three Services are short of officers, particularly the royal navy and the Army,35,   The Government does not underestimate the difficulties ofthe task ahead;   first to make good the current serious deficienciesand then to maintain recruitment at a level which matches theServices&apos; needs.   The spread of higher education and the impendingraising of the school-leaving age will drastically reduce thenumber of young men available for all kinds of employment in the15-19 age group, from which other rank   recruits to the services have mainly been drawn.   Everything possible will be done tomake life in the Services sufficiently attractive to competesuccessfully in all respects with civilian employment;   and to enhance the status of military service in the national life.36.   The Government recognises that there is no quick solutionand that manpower constraints will remain a problem for some timeto come;   but it also believes that its policies will fostera fuller public understanding of defence and the role of theForces,and thus help to create a climate of opinion favourable to recruitment.DEFENCE BUDGET37.   The revision of the defence programme has involved a thorough examination of expenditure plans within the review of public expenditure as a whole.   The Government was faced with two tasks:to find the money for the additional commitments which it proposed/ to(confidential)
ie nt16to undertake and for improvements required in defence capabilities;and to examine the whole of the defence programme to see whereeconomies could be made.   The costings of the defence programme which the Government had inherited considerably exceeded theprovisional allocations for defence in the plans for public expenditure for the years up to 1973-74, published by the previous administration in December 1969 in Cmnd. 4234.   Major cuts in theprogramme would have been necessary in order to meet the targetsset provisionally in that White Paper.38.   The table below shows the targets which have been set forthe Defence Budget, in relation to the Cmnd. 4234 figures and the costings of the previous Administrations defence programme:DEFENCE BUDGET ma.&apos;l971-7g     1272-7?     1973-74     1974-75(1)   Cmnd. 4234 2327 2230 ^        2230 C(2)   Costing ofadmiration-s &quot;55&apos;         305 2J59 2432programme(3)   Hm Budffet ^ ^ ^ ^II(U)   Savings onpreviousAdministration&apos;sr2fss.(3)) 28     l;     35 69 132Notes     a.    All figures are adjusted to 1970 Survey Prices-    b.     Allocations on a provisional basisc.    Allocation for 1972-73 simply carried forward____(confidential)
uA1739. The Defence Budget targets at serial 3 in &quot;the table are consistent with the estimated cost of the revised programme.They show that defence expenditure will not be held down to theprovisional allocations made by the previous Administration inGrand. h23U;   and also that, in the three years after 1971-72, itwill be contained at the level of the Defence Budget target nowset for that year.   The targets which have now been set for the &quot;next four years will involve substantial savings on previous plans,thus making a major contribution to the government s public expenditure ob jec tives.40.   These savings will reflect partly the results of the normalannual scrutiny of the long-term costing of the defence programme and partly the determination of the Government to make economies ,,wherever possible within the priorities of its defence policy.There will be adverse consequences for the Services which theGovernment would have preferred to avoid.   No major projects now on order will be cancelled;   but a number of projects of lesserpriority, mainly in the building and equipment fields, Will be cut or deferred.   The Government is satisfied that these reduc-tions, within the framework of the revised defence programme asa whole, will not affect its ability to meet its planned commit-ments.CONCLUSIONkU   There is much work still to be done to put into effect the/ decisions
confidential18decisions which have been taken;   there are also parts of thedefence programme which are still being examined.   But theGovernment has made good progress towards the objectives set outin paragraph 2 of this Statement.   In particular:a. It can now offer a valuable improvement in its military contribution to NATO;    the maritimestrength of the Alliance will be increased by thedecision on the ARK ROYAL;    the expansion of theT, &amp; A.V.R. will provide an additional armoured car regiment in an emergency;   and the revisionof the JAGUAR programme will make possible a major increase of four squadrons in Royal AirForce close support aircraft available to SAGEUR.These measures together demonstrate the importanceBritain attaches to the need for the european members of the Alliance to assume a fuller shareof the burden of defending the North atlantic treaty Area.b. After consultation with the Commonwealth Governmentsconcerned, it has decided the forces it plans tocontribute, as a continuing military presencebeyond 1971, to Five Power defence arrangements in South East Asia:   consultation on all aspectsof future arrangements is now taking place.c. It has settled firmly what share the defence/ programme
-)19programme will take of public expenditure as awhole over the next four financial years, and how the major changes it plans to make will be accomodated within it.h28   Thus the Government has acted quickly to fulfil its under-takings;   to demonstrate the importance it attaches to defence and the high value it places on the Armed Forces;   and to make\ i &apos;clear Britain&apos;s readiness within her resources to play a fullerpart in the maintenance of peace in the world.(confidential)
