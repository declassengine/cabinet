APPLICATION OP DECEMBER DECISIONS ONNIBMs1 PAY AND SENIOR STAFF SALARIESNote   by the Lord Privy seal at EY(P) on 22 February I was asked to indicate to what extent thedecision taken in December on NIBMfs pay and the parallel EY(P)decision on senior staff pay had so far been implemented.DECISION ON BOARD MEMBERS1 PAY2.     Before any general authorisation to make payment could be implemented it was necessary to agree with colleagues the cut offPoint beyond which the taper to 5% at  13,000 would apply.Consultations with them were almost complete when EY(P) were asked&quot;to reconsider the NIBMst pay question.    As a result of that no authority to pay the December increases was issued.3*     Sponsor colleagues have confirmed that no payments have in fact been made yet, though in one or two cases where the situation of thePost has changed or new appointments have been made after 31 December1977 the salaries determined have reflected the December increases.EY(P) DECISION ON SENIOR STAFF SALARIES4.     At a meeting on 21 December EY(P) decided that BNOC staffsalaries should be tapered so that those earning  13,000 a year ormore received no more than 5$.    This decision was also to set thePosition for other nationalised industries and similar bodies.    I was asked to coordinate action to ensure this policy was applied.5* When proposals were made to colleagues for achieving this they felt that such a policy would be unworkable. The principal -reasonsWere:i. The Government does not directly control staff salaries in the nationalised industries.    The pay policy guidelines donot include these restrictions and it was doubtful if allnationalised industries could be persuaded on other grounds toapply the policy, which might be regarded as discriminatory.mNFinFNTIAL
ii.       In some areas, staff salaries were already di.to those of other analogues, eg the Civil Service. 1there were traditional relationships to be observed, iinternal relativities between staff groups.y linerslingiii.     There may be contractual rights to different treatmentarising from existing pay relationships if they formed part of the  terms of appointment.iv. Settlements&apos; dates were not the same as NIBMs.settlements had been reached already.SomeThere was already serious worries about compression of .:1 differentials.    The application of a policy which wouJ-v.internal differentials.    The applworsen this would be strongly resisted.6. Examples of a) cases already settled not in accordance with ^EY(P) decision, and b) cases settled within that policy provided &amp;yDepartments are set out in Annex A.7.     There are also some important cases in the pipeline where full details are not yet known, these include:(the recently reported settle^11may cover senior staff)British Steel corporation british Airways board british Water board electricity Supply IndustryPost Office(pilots1 settlement date 1Negotiations in progress on &quot;Cf1.^basis of 10$ offer to all alTl &apos;employees).(Although negotiations are ^n ,progress an interim payment ohas been made.
