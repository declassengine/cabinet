ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1978INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Review ofthe economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry. It provides information which can be drawn on by the Government inresponding to the proposals by the e.c. Commission for agricultural support in1978/79 and when decisions are taken on support arrangements which remain within our national competence. As in 1977, these decisions will be announcedseparately.2. Information in the Statistical Appendix has in most cases been moved on to acalendar year basis, mainly in order to bring it into line with practice in theEuropean Economic Community, but also to reduce the number of differentyears to which the information relates and the element of forecasting. In most cases the forecasts for 1977 reflect the position as seen at November 1977.PART I-STATE OF THE industry. The main feature of agricultural production in 1977 has been the dramaticrecovery from the setbacks caused by the weather in the two preceding years.The index of agricultural net product, which in the drought-hit year of 1976 had fallen to 89, reached 112 in 1977 almost as high as the previous best year of1974. This improvement was largely the result of good weather which had a particularly marked effect on the production of milk and cereals. The industry&apos;scost increases in the period since the last Annual Review are set at  322-5 millioncompared with  895 million in the previous year. Agricultural net incomeexcluding stock appreciation is expected to rise from  1,158 million in 1976 to 1,348 million in 1977. This represents little change in real terms. The volume ofnew fixed investment in agriculture is expected to show a reduction in 1977,especially in buildings and works.4. There was a small increase in the size of the dairy herd in 1977 and thiscombined with substantially improved yields led to an increase in total sales of milk through the Milk Marketing Boards of 4-5% over 1976. Beef production is in the downward phase of the cycle; the beef breeding herd fell by a further4% and home production of beef is expected to be 5% down on 1976. Althoughproduction of sheepmeat is expected to be 4% lower than in 1976, there are signs of an increase in the breeding flock. The pig breeding herd fell by 7%between June 1976 and June 1977 as a result of difficulties encountered in this sector but returns to producers are expected to recover in 1978. Little change isexpected in the size of the egg-laying flock and the production of eggs is expectedto increase marginally. poultry meat production is also likely to increase slightly in 1977.5. In the arable sector the 1977 cereals crop is forecast to be some 3-7 milliontonnes greater than the 13-26 million tonnes produced in 1976; most of theincrease arises from higher yields. Potato plantings were higher than in 1976and, with yields recovering from the low, drought-affected levels of 1976,supplies should be more than adequate to meet requirements. The area of sugar beet harvested in 1977 is no greater than in 1976 but yields have recovered from the
low levels of the last three years and production of white sugar is forecast to amount to nearly 1 million tonnes. The area sown to oilseed rape has continuedto expand and yields have improved over the last few years. There was a furtherslight fall in 1977 in the area of certified herbage seed.6. The value of horticultural output continued to increase, despite the reductions in yields of vegetables in the first half of the year and losses oforchard and soft fruit, which were more than offset by higher prices. The reviewof the horticultural industry which was carried out by the Government and the farmers&apos; Unions early in 1977 forecast a brighter future for the industry than was generally thought possible five years ago. Increased efficiency and the pro-tective effect of the depreciation of sterling have been important factorscontributing to the profitability of horticulture.PART II-COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5,7 and 27)7. The area of cereals harvested in 1977 was 3-71 million hectares, slightlyabove the 3-68 million hectares in the previous year. Production is expected to total nearly 17 million tonnes, some 3-7 million tonnes above the 13-26 milliontonnes in 1976. The wet autumn of 1976 led to a decrease in the area sown towheat which was largely offset by an increase in the barley area. The harvest was delayed by a cold, wet spring but the favourable growing conditions in the summer led to exceptionally high yields, particularly in comparison with 1976when yields were unusually low because of drought. In the south, rain in mid-August reduced the quality of the crops, especially wheat, to well below average.Market prices, which rose rapidly in the autumn of 1976, continued to rise duringthe first half of 1977 to around threshold levels. Following the harvest, whilebreadmaking wheat and malting barley remained at a premium, the prices forfeed grains fell to near intervention levels. Owing to ideal conditions this autumnthe sowing of winter cereals is well advanced.Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 27)8. Production of oilseed rape in 1977 again reached a new record level owingpartly to a slight improvement in yields but largely to the increased area sown tothe crop. Prices towards the end of the 1976/77 marketing year were good but have since fallen following the announcement of a record soya crop in the USA withwhich rapeseed is in direct competition on the world market.Potatoes (Tables 2, 5,9 and 27)9. In 1977 the target area of 210,000 hectares was exceeded by some 20,000hectares but the yield was at a lower level than would normally have been&quot;expected, and depending on the extent to which consumption levels returnto normal, a small surplus can be expected. In view of low producer prices at thebeginning of the season, the Potato Marketing Board, with Exchequer assist-ance, undertook a market support programme in the autumn with the purposeof influencing market prices, so that the average for the season would achieve the guaranteed price of  45-77 per tonne.
10. Proposals for an e.c. regime for potatoes have continued to be discussed,but it is not certain that agreement can be reached in time for common arrange-ments to apply to the 1978 crop. Consideration is currently being given to theappropriate form of marketing and support arrangements for that crop in theabsence of a common regime.Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5,10 and 27)11. For 1977 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom 206,000 hectares. Some 201,000 hectares are expected to be harvested,about the same as in 1976. Weather during the growing season was generallygood, yields of beet per hectare are slightly up and sugar content is showing asubstantial improvement on last year. Assuming that harvesting and processingproceed as planned, the crop should yield between 900,000 and 1 million tonnes of white sugar.12. Contracts for 1978 have not yet been completed but the Corporation aimsto increase its contracted area.Horticulture (Tables 2, 5,11 and 27)13. The area devoted to horticulture was 289,000 hectares at June 1976 andthe provisional figure for 1977 shows no change in the total area. Details aregiven for the four commodities grown in the UK which are affected by Com-munity intervention arrangements in the fruit and vegetables sector.(a) Apples. The area of apple orchards (excluding cider apples) continuesto decline slowly and in 1977 is estimated at 31,600 hectares. Produc-tion capacity, however, has changed very little because of more intensive new orchard planting. The long-term effects of the 1976drought combined with this year&apos;s cold spring led to reduced yields in1977. Supplies from major apple-exporting countries were also lower than usual. Prices in the UK have consequently been much higher thanin 1976.(b) Pears. The area under pears (excluding perry pears) has changed verylittle in recent years and is estimated at 5,200 hectares in 1977. Thisyear&apos;s crop is slightly below average and substantially below the high level of 1976. Prices are likely to be higher than in 1976, because ofboth the lighter pear crop and the higher apple prices.(c) Cauliflowers. The area under cauliflowers continues to decline from the peak in the late 1960s and is estimated to be 14,000 hectares in 1977.The cold, wet weather in late 1976 and early 1977 reduced production of winter cauliflowers but better weather later in the year resulted in an overallincrease in output in 1977 compared with 1976. Prices remained highuntil the late summer of 1977 and the sharp drop since then is not likely to be sufficient to reduce the average price for 1977 below that for1976.(d) Tomatoes. About 950 hectares of glasshouse area were used for tomatoproduction in 1977. This figure has remained fairly constant for someyears. Poor light conditions reduced yields in 1977 and output is
slightly down on the high levels of 1976. Prices are expected to be significantly higher than last year.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 27)14. The area under hops remained stable in 1977 at about 6,000 hectares.There has been a gradual long-term decline in area resulting from the improvedutilisation of hops by brewers and increased yields from new varieties. The cold,wet weather early in the year reduced yields to well below those in 1976, whichwere themselves adversely affected by the drought. Prices for hops in 1977 aresimilar to those in 1976.Seeds (Table 13)15. The area of certified herbage seed which had fallen substantially in both1975 and 1976 showed only a very slight further fall (1%) in 1977. Yields ingeneral are good with mainly firm prices which are showing an increase on 1976levels. A notable exception is Italian Ryegrass where increased production hasresulted in depressed prices. Home production of herbage seed normally meets55 % of total requirements but abnormal weather conditions resulted in increased imports.16. The area of certified field bean seed is down by 15% in 1977 but is stillexcessive in the light of the demand for certified seed for cropping. The expansionof the area sown for the production of certified field pea seed although small continues at a high rate and the sharp upward trend is expected to continue.The area of certified seed of linseed rose sharply in 1976 but fell back again in1977 almost to 1975 levels.Beef and Milk (Tables 2,5,14,15,16 and 27)17. The 1977 June census for the UK showed a levelling out of the declinein the total breeding herd. Numbers were only marginally lower than in June1976; the dairy herd about 66% of all breeding cows showed an increase of1 % but the beef herd was 4 % smaller. In England and Wales the Septembersample census indicated a fall of 1 % in the total herd compared with the previous year, due entirely to a further decline in the beef breeding herd.18. Home production of beef in 1977 is expected to be about 5 % less than in1976, but this decline has been balanced by an increase in imports and decreasein exports in trade with other e.c. countries so that total supplies available forconsumption are likely to be about the same as in 1976. Average market prices for certified cattle in the UK remained above the weekly target prices untilthe end of July 1977, reaching a peak of 63-17p per live kg in mid-June. There-after, variable premiums were payable in most weeks as market prices underwenta seasonal decline into the autumn. Throughout this period the market wasunderpinned by a moderate amount of intervention.19. The average milk yield per cow in 1977 is expected to show an improve-ment of 3-5% on the 1976 level while the average size of the national dairy herd is expected to increase by about 1 % over the previous year. As a result,milk production in 1977 is expected to show an increase of about 4-5% over
that for 1976. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption in 1977 isexpected to be lower than in 1976, whilst the availability of milk for manu-facture increases appreciably. Cheese production in 1977 is expected to increaseslightly over the previous year&apos;s level and butter production is forecast toincrease substantially over the 1976 level. Increases in the guaranteed price for milk and the standard quantity at the 1977 Annual Review led to an increase of almost 6 % in the guaranteed price for milk for the period 1 April to 31 December.20. As required by the Treaty of Accession the guaranteed price arrangementsfor milk producers ended on 31 December 1977 and producer returns from1 January 1978 depend on the returns the Milk Marketing Boards obtain fromthe liquid and manufacturing milk markets.21. The average size of the national dairy herd in 1978 is expected to declineslightly, so that any improvement in milk production in 1978 will depend on whether yields continue to improve.Sheep and Wool (Tables 2,14,18 and 27)22. Between June 1976 and June 1977 there was a small increase (0-2%) inthe total UK breeding flock, the increase in the number of shearling ewes morethan compensating for the drop in older ewe numbers. Although the lambcrop was just over 2% smaller than the record crop of 1976, with fewer slaughter-ings in 1977 the breeding flock is expected to increase in 1978.23. UK home production of sheepmeat is expected to be about 4 % lower in1977 than in 1976, while at the same time imports are expected to drop by -5% and exports to increase by 16%, resulting in a drop in available supplies to the UK home market of just over 5%. In 1977 prices for fat sheep have beenabove the guarantee, except for 6 weeks between June and August, averagingabout 20 % above last year&apos;s levels. Prices paid for store lambs and hill ewes have again risen well above those paid the previous year.24. Production of wool in 1977 again declined very marginally. Prices wereespecially strong in 1976 owing to the fall in the value of sterling and rose toreach a peak of 126p per kg in February 1977. UK prices then declined by15-20% in line with a general weakening of world markets. On average, auctionprices for the 1977 clip are expected to be below the guarantee but producers&apos;returns will be made good from the stabilising fund built up during last season&apos;shigh-priced sales.Pigs (Tables 2,14 and 27)25. The decline in profitability which began in 1976 continued into 1977 andled to a fall of 7% in the pig breeding herd between June 1976 and June 1977.This is being reflected in lower supplies of pigmeat and production in 1978 isexpected to be lower than in 1977.26. The resulting increase in pig prices together with a reduction in feedcosts from the highest levels of 1976/77 may encourage some modest expansion in the breeding herd during 1978.
poultry meat (Tables 2, 14 and 27)27. Output of poultry meat is expected to show a small increase in 1977.Turkey prices have increased but other poultry prices remained generallysteady over the year.Eggs (Tables 2, 5,17 and 27)28. Both the annual average size of the laying flock and output are expectedto show a small increase in 1977 and higher yields per bird may be reflected in afurther marginal increase in production in 1978. Egg prices have fluctuated butover the year as a whole average producer prices are expected to be higher thanin 1976.PART in-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 3)29. The number of farms in the UK continues to decline. Because thestandard labour requirements for crops and livestock have been revised in line with current labour usage, comparative figures of holdings by size of businessare not available for years before 1975. In 1977 the total number of holdingswas 261,000, that is 3 % lower than in 1975. Among relatively small changesover this period, the percentage fall in numbers has been most marked amongthe smaller full-time businesses. Just over 50% of holdings have businessescapable of providing work for at least one man (now defined as those of 250revised standard man-days or more) but these account for 90% of total output(though in Northern Ireland and Wales the output of part-time farms is rather more significant than in other parts of the UK), while large businesses (1,000standard man-days or more), though only about 10% of the total number,produce about a half of total output.30. The average size of farms is increasing. Full-time businesses averaged113 hectares (total area including rough grazings) in 1977 compared with 111hectares in 1975. The trend to greater specialisation continues with the numberof enterprises (eg dairy herds) declining and their average size increasing.Between 1975 and 1977 the average area of cereals has increased from 30 to 32hectares; the average dairy herd has risen from 40 to 44 cows though the averagebeef breeding herd at 18 cows may have declined slightly; the average ewe flockhas increased from 164 to 167 breeding sheep and the average pig breedingherd rose from 23 to 25 sows.31. In Great Britain 62% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1977 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of the totalarea held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 57% in1977. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 19)32. With the change to calendar year accounts, the index has been re-basedon 1975=100. It fell to 89 in 1976 because of the drought in that year and the continuing effects of the dry weather of 1975. In 1977, however, it is expected
to have recovered to 112-almost back to the average 1972-74 level-as a resultof the record cereals harvest, the more normal potato crop and increased milkyields.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 19)33. The adverse weather in 1975 and 1976 reduced the volume of output andthis is reflected in reduced labour productivity (the volume of gross product perperson engaged) for these two years but a substantial recovery to a record level is forecast for 1977. Over the past ten years labour productivity has increased at nearly 4 % per annum, only a little below the average of 4 % to 5 % per annum in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The outflow of regular whole-time workershas continued. In 1976 and 1977 the rate was just over 3 % per annumrespectively compared with 5 % to 6 % per annum in the 1960s.Net income of the industry (Tables 19,21 and 24)34. Excluding stock appreciation, aggregate net income, which increased by25% to  1,158 million in 1976, is expected to show a further increase of 16%to  1,348 million in 1977. In real terms the increase between 1975 and 1976 was% and little change is likely in 1977. When stock appreciation is included,aggregate net income increased by 28 % to  1,835 million in 1976 and is expectedto have fallen by 2% to  1,796 million in 1977. In real terms a 10% increase between 1975 and 1976 is expected to be followed by a fall of 15-5% in 1977.35. The other main scries of farm incomes data examined at the annual review is based on samples of full time accounts. They show the impact of the drought and other factors on net income per farm in 1976/77 in the differentsectors and regions of the UK. The accounts end on average in February andthis year net income excludes stock appreciation of breeding livestock. For this and other reasons the farm accounts results show different changes in income from the aggregate series. Average net income of all types (excluding horticulture-culture) went up in 1976/77 in all countries but at a much lower rate than inthe previous year. In England income rose by 4%, in Wales by 28 %, in scotland by 10 % and in Northern Ireland by 21 %. Higher prices for most crops more thancompensated in England and Wales for lower yields caused by the drought andthe value of crop output rose by nearly a quarter. The value of output of mostlivestock was also up, particularly of sheep. Feed prices rose sharply and inEngland and Wales the poor growth of grass and fodder crops during the droughtled to heavier feed bills.36. On dairy farms higher milk prices and larger herds contributed to in-creases in income, although in England the rise was less than elsewhere with the drought reducing milk yields and pushing up feed purchases. Sheep farmsachieved the largest increase in income. Cattle farms generally had betterincomes but for some cattle fatteners income was reduced by heavier feed billsand smaller margins between store and fat prices. Higher prices for manycrops contributed to larger incomes on cropping farms in most regions, although in Scotland the increase over the record level of 1975/76 was small. The sharprise in feed prices and only a small increase in output of pigs and poultry reduced
incomes on farms with substantial pig and poultry enterprises, except inNorthern Ireland. In real terms income fell in England and also in Scotlandwhere it had reached a record level in 1975/76. In Wales and in Northern ireland there was a further but much smaller increase.37. Forecasts of trends in 1977/78 indicate a small rise in average income inEngland and Wales and Northern Ireland but a fall in Scotland. The recordcereals harvest is expected to offset lower prices and the value of cereals output in England and Wales should rise. But the sharp drop in prices will reduce thevalue of potato output, particularly in areas which had good crops in theprevious year. Lower feed prices and, in England and Wales, more plentifulsupplies this year of home grown cereals, grass and fodder crops will generallyreduce feed bills and benefit incomes of livestock producers. Milk yields haverecovered in England and Wales and with generally higher prices for calves andcull cows, dairy incomes should go up in most areas of the UK. Prices for bothfat and store sheep have generally been buoyant and a further rise in income islikely on sheep farms. Suckled calf prices were mostly lower than last year&apos;shigh levels at the autumn sales and the increase in fat cattle prices has not been sufficient to offset higher costs: incomes of many cattle enterprises may thereforedrop, despite lower feed prices and in Great Britain more plentiful fodder. Withsubstantially lower potato revenue, incomes on many general cropping andmixed farms are likely to decline, particularly in Scotland and Northern Irelandwhich had benefited most from the high potato prices in the previous twoyears, but higher cereal yields in England and Wales are likely to lead to anincrease on specialist cereal farms there. A good recovery in incomes on pigand poultry holdings is expected. In real terms average incomes in 1977/78 areforecast to fall, particularly in Scotland.Cost changes (Table 26)38. Net cost increases since 1976 are assessed at about  322-5 million for allproducts. The main increases are for machinery depreciation ( 127 million),labour ( 112 million), miscellaneous expenditure ( 58 million) and fertilisersand lime ( 49 million). There are estimated reductions in the costs of animalfeedingstuffs ( 62 million), interest ( 58 million) and seeds ( 25 million).Gross capital formation (Table 23)39. It is estimated that there will be a further increase in the value of new investment in 1977. Total gross capital formation in landlord and tenant-typephysical assets together is estimated to be  1,596 million in 1977; of this  614million is estimated to be in plant, machinery and vehicles, ie a rise of 23%over the amount invested in 1976, and  724 million in additions to stocks and work-in-progress. New investment in buildings and works (landlord-type assets)is expected to amount to  258 million. In volume terms new investment in 1977in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to be between 1 % and 2 % lower than in 1976. The volume of investment in buildings and works has continued the downward trend begun in 1973 and in 1977 was 5% lower than in 1976. the physical level of stocks and work-in-progress in 1977 is expected to be higherthan in 1976 reflecting larger stocks of harvested crops including fodder. despite the improvements in conditions, coverage and rates of grants from 1 June 1976,
the number of applications estimated for 1977 under the Farm Capital GrantsSchemes is likely to be 11 % below the number received in 1976. Most of this work would be for completion in 1978 and later years. Under the Farm andHorticulture Development Scheme, however, initial eligibility applicationsrose sharply after the June changes and nearly 7,000 plans are estimated to be approved in 1977 compared with 479 in 1975 and 1,953 in 1976. Investmentunder the Scheme takes place in the framework of development plans whichcan vary in length from one to six years.Agricultural land prices40. The average price for all sales of agricultural land of 4 hectares and overin England and Wales, as reported to the Inland Revenue, was  1,295 perhectare for the six-month period ended September 1977. This compares with aprice of  1,287 per hectare for the period ended March 1977 and  1,086 perhectare for the period ended September 1976. Because of the delay between asale being agreed and its notification to the Inland Revenue, this series is subject toa time lag of several months. More up-to-date informationfromtheADAS/AMCseries, which is less comprehensive and relates only to vacant possession sales,indicated that there was a substantial increase in prices in the middle of 1977.The average price of vacant possession land in the three-month period ended september 1977, shown by this series, was  2,406 per hectare. There have alsobeen significant increases in agricultural land prices in Scotland and NorthernIreland.Farm rents (Table 22)41. Farm rents in the UK are estimated to have increased by an average of15-9% in 1977. This estimate is based on the provisional results of the annualADAS Rent Enquiry in England and Wales and on field enquiries in Scotland.This increase compares with increases of 19-3% in 1976, 16-8% in 1975 and-7% in 1974.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)42. In the calendar year 1976 the average earnings of whole-time hired menin the UK were  50-27 per week, including the  6 increases in minimum ratesawarded in the winter of 1975/76. Compared with 1975 this is a rise of 17% in money terms and of 0-5% in real terms. In 1977 average whole-time earnings are forecast at about  54 per week, a rise of 7-5 % in money terms but a reductionin real terms.Public expenditure (Table 25)43. In 1977/78 the estimated outturn for expenditure in the UK on price guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding the brucellosis incentives and payments connected with the milk subsidy) is about  204 million. The corn-parable figure for 1976/77 is about  207 million. Expenditure on hill livestockcompensatory allowances is expected to be lower than in 1976/77, when theoutturn was inflated by payments carried over from 1975/76. This decrease isexpected to be partly offset by payments under the capital grant schemes andthe new Milk Non-Marketing and Conversion Premium Scheme.
44. Expenditure under the common market organisation of the e.c. isestimated to increase by some  33 million to about  204 million in 1977/78compared with expenditure of  171 million in 1976/77. This expenditure bythe Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce includes the Beef VariablePremium Scheme, import and export refunds, certain production subsidies,the gross cost of aids to private storage and the net cost of commodities boughtinto intervention and subsequently sold. Some of this expenditure benefitsconsumers and overseas exporting interests rather than producers. The addi-tional expenditure in 1977/78 is mainly due to increased purchases into inter-vention of skimmed milk powder and butter. Whilst these and other variationsaccount for an increase of some  61 million this has been partly offset by a reduc-tion of about  28 million in the net cost of import and export refunds.
APPENDIXStatistical TablesThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper except thatTable 27 on Commodity Price Trends has been simplified. Two changes in presentation have,however, been made; the columns showing equivalents in imperial units no longer appear and,with the exceptions of tables relating to fixed dates and those on Herbage Seeds (Table 13),Specimen Net Incomes (Table 24) and Public Expenditure (Table 25), information is now shown on a calendar year basis. Forecasts, which arc as at November 1977 unless otherwise indicated,generally refer to the position up to the end of 1977. For some commodities the move to acalendar year basis has involved the introduction of stock figures into the supply tables.Calendar year figures arc not available before 1967 and the three-year averages arc thereforegiven for the period 1967 to 1969. New base years have been introduced for some of theindices in Tables 1, 19 and 22.Even where there has been no change in the basis of the tables, some of the figures in this appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statisticalmethods.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to the countries of the enlarged European Economic Community (Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, theIrish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables.Figures for exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot;not available&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot;.

(a) The coverage Tor 1973 and onwards includes all known holdings in the United Kingdom with 40 standardman-days or more fa standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours&apos; productive work by an adult male workerunder average conditions). All holdings with less than 40 smd in Scotland are excluded. In England andWales and Northern Ireland holdings with less than 40 smd arc excluded only if they have less than 4 hectares(10 acres) of crops and grass and no regular whole-time worker. The same criteria applied in Great britain in the years 1970 to 1972, except that the threshold for standard labour requirements in those years was26 smd.The 1967-69 figures related to all known agricultural holdings exceeding one acre (0-4 hectares) in extent.The figures for Northern Ireland for these years related to holdings of one acre (0-4 hectares) or more, exceptfor numbers of livestock, which were collected from all owners, irrespective of the size of the holding, aswell as from landless stockholders.The Introduction of the changes of definition in Northern Ireland in 1973, following similar changes in GreatBritain which excluded some 14.000 statistically insignificant holdings in 1970 and about 8,000 In 1973, hadthe net result of eliminating about 6,000 or so holdings from the Northern Ireland census.(6) For threshing.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.(d) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(?)

From June 1969to June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings,etc, the use of which was ancillary to the farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land withinagricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land. The Northern Irelanddefinition is unchanged.

Although the figures quoted for 197Sand 1977 are strictly comparable, great caution must be exercised in comparing them with figures quoted in earlier Annual Review White Papers. The figures included for Northern Ireland in the first two sectionsfor both years relate only to holdings with 50 smd or more.The average size of holding based on total area was 1975 66-1 hectares of which 45-2 hectares were crops and gnus1977 67-4 hectares of which 46-9 hectares were crops and grassThese figures include holdings with no crops and grass area which are excluded from the first section of the table.(d) Revised standard man day groups have been adopted and the lower group of under 250 smd applies through-out the UK. The change in smd values has meant a general shift of holdings into lower size groups and this movement is particularly marked in Northern Ireland as the following figures show: Holdings In Northern Ireland-June 1975 (&quot;000)(*)(c)Based onold smd values50-199 smd200-599 smd600-1,199 smd1,200 smd and overTotal16012-63-81-233-6Based on new smd values50-249 smd250-499 smd500-999 smd1,000 smd and overTotal2006-92-80-730-as a result of this change, the figures shown in this table are not comparable with those in previous white papers.(r)  Figures relate to England and Wales only.CO Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland relate to the December censuses in 1974 and 1976.(g) Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to pig holdings which had fattening pigs only.(A) Figures for Scotland, and figures for Northern Ireland in 1977 only, include small numbers of other tablefowls.

They include some estimates for figures notdirecUy obtainable from the Scottish census results and for that reason they differ slightly from some of the published United Kingdom census results. Because of changes in the census categories in England and wales in 1970 and 1972, numbers returned for earlier years are not available on the same basis as those for themost recent years. Before 1977 the figures do not include the wives/husbands of farmers, partners anddirectors, even though the wives/husbands themselves may be partners or directors. In 1977 wives/husbandsof farmers, partners and directors were returned separately, but only if they were engaged in farm work.(ft) Figures relate to Great Britain only.(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland. See footnote (rf).(d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item in Northern Ireland, but were included with part-time workers.(r) The increase in numbers of farmers, partners and directors in 1976 occurred in England and Wales and isthought to reflect a more complete enumeration in the agricultural census.(/) The decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers in 1977 is thought to be explained by the separate return, for the first time in England and Wales, of farmers&apos; wives, some of whom were probably returned previously as family workers.

The occupiers&quot;investment includes all tenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc, but excludes any financial assets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings. These figures are not directly corn-parable with incomes in other sectors of the economy, since farm income also includes elements of wagesand changes in stock valuations as well as profits.(b) This is net income at current prices including the change in the volume of stocks and work-in-progress but excluding stock appreciation (ic that part of the change in the value of stocks and work-in-progress attribut-able to the change in the cost of inputs between the beginning and end of year).(c) Net product (net output) measures year-to-year changes in the value-added at constant prices by farmers,landowners and farmworkers to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.i,/) Labour productivity is defined here as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product isgross output less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest. It is measured here at constant prices. In order to be consistent with national economic conventions, gross product as used in the calculation of labour productivity covers agricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings. Thetotal number of persons engaged in agriculture comprises the number of employees, employers and self-employed (excluding farmers&apos; spouses) recorded in the annual June census taken by the agricultural departments. Before 1971, however, the trends in numbers of employers and employees were estimatedrespectively from the Population Censuses and the Department of Employment count of national insurancecards.Table 20Calendar yearsAverage earnings and hours of agricultural workers (a)	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977 (forecast)Earnings   per week (b) Hours per week (c)......	27-32 47-2	3407 45-9	42-92 460	50-27 45-5	54-00 45-8(a) For all hired regular whole-time men.(6) Earnings include pay for statutory holidays and paymcnts-in-kind which are valued at rates set down by theAgricultural Wages Board:, and comprise houses, milk, potatoes, etc (the principal one being houses, most ofwhich were, in England and Wales, valued at 50p before 20 January 1976 and  1-50 thereafter).(c)  All hours worked and statutory holidays.

(c) Output is netted of Value Added Tax (VAT) collected on the sale of inedible products, which is repaid toII.M. Customs and Excise. Figures include subsidies,(a&quot;) Excludes deficiency payments on retained cereals and compensation payments on unsold potatoes see (J).let  Beans for stockfecd, hay and dried grass, oilseed rape, grass and clover seed and other farm crops.if) Flowers, bulbs and nursery stock, seeds and other minor products.(g) Breeding animals exported, poultry for stock and export, rabbits and game, knacker animals and other minorlivestock.(A) Honey, goat milk, export of eggs for hatching and other minor livestock products,(i) Own account capital formation, timber, osiers, peat and turf.ij) Deficiency payments on cereal retentions. Potato Marketing Board compensation payments, animal diseasecompensation, co-operative society dividends and interest and other miscellaneous receipts.(A) Growing crops and livestock numbers: closing level minus opening level.(I) Stocks of unsold harvested crops; closing level minus opening level.(m) Sales included in Output but subsequently repurchased and so reappearing as Input.in) Cereals, potatoes, beans, hay and dried grass,(o) Before subsidy where applicable.(/&apos;) Including landlord-type maintenance work.(0) Electricity, veterinary expenses, pesticides, rates and miscellaneous costs.(r) Expenditure is netted or VAT reclaimed in the normal way, but each heading includes VAT paid withoutrecovery by, for example, unregistered producers. The total unrecovered tax is estimated at  10 million for1975,  12 million for 1976 and for 1977  13 million.(j)  Feed (purchased) and fertilisers. Opening stock minus closing stock.(r) Net Rent is the residual after deducting landlords&apos; maintenance and depreciation from Gross Rent. Land-lords&apos; maintenance and landlords&apos; depreciation are included in Farm Maintenance and Depreciation and hence the whole of Gross Rent is treated as a cost to the industry. The estimates of Gross Rent are  205.1 million in 1973.  226.6 million in 1974,  263.1 million in 1975,  309.3 million in 1976 and  359.0 million in 1977.iu) On commercial debt for current farming purposes.(v) Stock appreciation measures that part of the change in the value of stocks and work-in-progress attributable to the change in the cost of inputs between the beginning and end of year.Table 22Farm rents (a)Calendar yearsYear	Index of gross rents per hectare 1975 - 1001967	54-71968	58-81969	63 01970	67-21971	70-91972	74-91973	79-21974	8611975	10001976	119-11977 (provisional)	137-8(a) Gross rents per hectare vary considerably between different regions and sizes and types of farm. detailed information on farm rents is published in &quot;Farm Rents in England and Wales&quot; and in &quot;Scottish AgriculturalEconomics&quot;.

Investment in plant and machinery is normally tenant-type. Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord-type. In practice,however, there are many variations in the division between the two responsibilities. The figures in the tablerepresent gross expenditure before crediting any grants which reduce the cost to the owner or occupier. Annualcharges in the form of depreciation are made for these items in calculating aggregate farming net income.(6) See Table 21 (Item 10 plus item 22 minus item 15).

(a) These figures are collected by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and the Departmentof Agriculture in Northern Ireland. They are averages weighted by the census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1976/77&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1978&quot;,lor Northern Ireland in &quot;Farm Incomes and Investment in Northern Ireland 1976/77&quot;, and for Wales in the&quot;Supplement to the Annual Digest of Welsh Statistics 1976/77&quot;. Net income is defined as in the aggregateaeries (Tables 19 and 21) except that stock appreciation is assessed at current market prices and that nodeduction is made for interest on farming debts. Net income is shown in this table for the first time excludingthat part of the total valuation change which is attributable to changes during the trading year in estimatedmarket values (but not in the numbers) of breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. Footnote (v) to Table 21 describes the different definition of stock appreciation deducted in the corresponding aggregate scries. All farms are treated as rented and an imputed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers.The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or to the year ending 5 April. The average year-endingdate is about mid-February.(o) Based on standard labour requirements per unit of crop area and per head of livestock at 1968 levels (secTable 3, footnotes (a) &amp; id)).ic) Includes &quot;mixed&quot; farm type but excludes &quot;pigs and poultry&quot;, &quot;cropping&quot; and &quot;horticultural&quot; farm types.id) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot beimputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have been included. For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for GreatBritain.it) Includes &quot;cattle, sheep and pigs&quot;, &quot;pigs and poultry&quot; and &quot;cropping&quot; farm types.Table 25Public expenditure under the common agricultural policy (CAP) and on national grants and subsidies (a)April/March (financial) years				  million		1973/74	1974/75	1975/76	1976/77	1977/78 (forecast)I   Price guarantees and production grants (i) Price guarantees on products supported by the CAP Cereals (6) .........

It does,however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and overseas exporting interests rather thanproducers(see note (h)). The figures for years up to and including 1975/76 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1976/77 are subject to confirmation and those for 1977/78are the latest estimates of expenditure.(6) Payments in respect of cereals, wool and potatoes relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated andpartly to the crops or dips in the preceding year or years. The figures shown in brackets reflect the arrange-ments with the British Wool Marketing Board, whereby deficiency payments made by the Exchequer arerepayable from surpluses (excess of market price over guaranteed price) up to the amount of debt owing bythe Board to Ministers.
(c) Payments on milk reflect the Government policy of holding down the retail price of milk. For public cxpendi-ture purposes, they have been attributed to expenditure under the price guarantees in 1973/74 and shown inthe body of the table above, but for subsequent years the expenditure has been attributed to the food subsidies programme.(d) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Farm and Horticulture Develop-ment Scheme and the Farm Capital Grant Scheme. The estimated benefit is shown separately in section iii of the table.(t) Includes grants in respect of investment on self-propelled machines (agricultural and horticultural), credit4,forage groups&apos;, small horticultural production businesses&apos;, small farmers, farm business records, watersupply&apos;, agricultural drainage&apos;, special assistance to livestock producers&apos; and hops restructuring. (Provisionfor the schemes marked * was included in the 1977/78 Supply Estimates.)(/) Some unavoidable delay in payments in 197S/76 resulted in a carryover of  16.4 million into 1976/77.(r) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land&apos;, rural roads&apos;, producers in theScottish Islands&apos;, crofting improvements&apos;, hill cattle agistmcnt subsidy and hill livestock and young stockscheme&apos;. (Provision for the schemes marked * was included in the 1977/78 Supply Estimates.)(A) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from FEOGA which are shownseparately at the foot of the table. The figures are made up of several elements and include import refunds(net of export levies) on intra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beefpremium scheme, aid for private storage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the net cost of commodities bought into intervention and subsequently sold. The figures for 1974/75, 1975/76 and 1976/77include the special import subsidy on sugar. Much of the expenditure benefits consumers and overseas export -ing interests rather than producers. The consumer subsidy on butter is not included.i /&apos;) Includes eggs, poultry meat, fruit and vegetables, oilseeds, hops, herbage seeds, dehydrated fodder andfisheries. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significantextent in the United Kingdom (rice, wine, flax and hemp).Table 26Aggregate cost changes since the 1977 Annual Review (a)  million	Net cost change relating	to all productsFecdingstuffs ........................	- 62-2Seeds ... ........................	- 24-6Imported livestock .....................	+ 7-6Fertilisers and lime .....................	+ 48-6Machinery (including depreciation) ...............	+ 175-5Maintenance (including depreciation on equipment) ......	+ 15-miscellaneous........................	+ 58-1Labour ...........................	+ 111-9Gnu r**nt                                                ... ...	+ 33-9vii &quot;       IViil                                    ...              ...              ***              mma              ***              ... ...
