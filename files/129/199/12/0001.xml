CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80CP(78;12 COPY NO31 January 1978CABINETTHE ECONOMIC PROSPECT AND POLICIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTION1- In this paper I seek to give my colleagues a first and necessarilyonly general view of the prospect and problems before us.     We will be ableto consider these matters in more depth and detail in a few weeks, when weshall have the new economic forecasts and can assess their implications.That will be the time to form a judgment on the appropriate size of fiscalstimulus for the spring Budget, and to choose between the range of methodsavailable for producing it.    It would not be profitable at ihis stage for us todiscuss precise figures (of the kind suggested by the Secretary of State for social Services and the Minister for Sccial Security - see Annex to this paper), which would have to be plucked largely out of the air.2- This paper therefore concentrates rather on the background to theBudget and the relationship between our various objectives, and discussessome of the uncertainties which will inevitably surround the decisions weshall ultimately make.DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE OCTOBER MEASURES3- The object of the October measures was to produce more jobs and^vestment by building on our dramatic financial recovery to promote acorresponding recovery in the real economy.    We described the measures as part of a programme of economic recovery spreading over 18 months.Xt may be helpful, therefore, to begin by reviewing developments in the economy since October, and noting how the we have differed from theProjections which we published at that time.4- Since October, some trends have begun to establish themselvesmore clearly, but great uncertainties remain.     There are three areas, inParticular, where events have developed differently from what we thenProjected.    Sterling has come under greater upward pressures than wee*pected - largely as a consequence of the weak dollar - and has appreciated5 Per cent.    The increase in earnings during this pay round so far has been
a little above the 10 per cent guidelines.    Though this is better than we mighthave feared it is still well above the rate of increase among our maincompetitors, who also enjoy a higher growth in productivity than we do.The latest figures suggest that the increase in unit labour costs this year willbe increasing at between *J and 5 per cent in our main competitors and well over twice as fast in the United Kingdom.    World trade has been increasing very slowly  forecasts of economic growth this year have been revised downwards;  and only in North America can we expect actualexpansion to keep pace with the potential for growth.5. Looking ahead, there is a very good chance now that we shall seesingle figure inflation right through the year, if our incomes policy holds atLeast as well as it has done so far, and there is no sharp fall in the sterlingexchange rate.     On the other hand, it is probably unrealistic to expect tohold the rate of inflation at this level far into 1979. if earnings continue toincrease at their present rate;  and we should be facing very serious dangersonce again, if wage increases were to accelerate and confidence in sterlingwere shaken.*- Taken together, these factors probably indicate that (in the absenceo* further fiscal action) we must now expect a growth rate lower than the per cent which we projected on the assumptions of last October, but alsoa worse balance of payments.    The function of the spring Budget must,therefore, be to stimulate demand in a wav which produces and sustains^ore domestic output, and thus produces more jobs.    If we failed to control the inflationary pressures, which may build up as we move into 1979, wewould risk cutting short the recovery in its early stages.    This in turn hasimplications for the size of the fiscal stimulus which we can afford to give,Without prejudicing our own objectives.    If we were to lose the confidence ofthe financial markets, this would bring the familiar destructive consequencesfcr our hopes of increased investment, for financing our domesticGrowing requirement and for the value of sterling.    So we need to keep alirnit on the public sector borrowing requirement and to keep control of the monetary aggregates.7- Even with North Sea oil flowing, the balance of payments will not look after itself.    To expand domestic demand at a rate which would push thocu*rent account into deficit would itself be a severe blow to confidence. It*ould also cause major problems in another area of particular importance -that of our overseas debts.    My objective is to spread out our debtrePayments over a much longer period - so as to minimise what could other-*ise be a troublesome constraint on our ability to maximise our rate of?*Owth.     This means undertaking a programme of new borrowing overseas,n order to finance the repayment of our existing debts as they mature. for purpose we need to run a balance of payments surplus over the next fewMarketthisrs which is sufficient to maintain our credit in overseas financial
8. In brief, we need to set the right intermediate objectives for themoney supply, the public sector borrowing requirement and the balance ofPayments, if we are to increase our domestic output and employment to themaximum.    The way in which we expand domestic demand will to a significant extent determine the amount by which we can effectively expanddomestic output.    For reasons which I explain later in this note (and despitewhat is said in CP(78) 10) in the present situation tax cuts will help us morethan a further addition to public expenditure.MAIN AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY9- There is great uncertainty, and wide disagreement among economists,not only about the course of growth, employment, and inflation in Britainover the next year or so, but also about changes that seem to be taking placem previously established economic relationships and in the effectiveness ofme policy instruments available.10- First, the exchange rate.    According to a view held by manyeconomists, an appreciation of che exchange rate will in due course bringaW a significant and measurable worsening in the balance of payments and^e level of domestic activity - though there will be a long lag before the fulle^ects come through and (other things beir.g equal) after a further lag theejects will eventually wear off as inflation comes down.    This is the con-verse of the well-known J-curve resulting from depreciation. Sucheconomists acknowledge that there is a great uncertainty about the length ofme lags - how long it will be before the full effects come through on the domestic economy, and how long Jt will be before the effects subsequentlywear off.    As against that, quite apart from the school of monetarists wnichbelieves that appreciation does much more good than harm, othereconomists, while they accept the broad analysis described above, believeth-t a strong domestic currency will produce benefits on inflation andirnprove confidence more generally, to a degree which may make it worthaccepting the adverse effects of an exchange rate appreciation.    Here againthere is great uncertainty about the speed with which the beneficial effectswill*7 come through, and therefore about the size and duration of the tran-8ltional costs - particularly in terms of unemployment and the balance ofpayments.11.  In any case, there is general agreement that the power of^Vernments to control the course of the exchange rate is strictly limited.gt   Vo^ume of funds which can be moved across the exchanges is muchj^eater than Governments can offset for more than a short period of time.ra^0ur case the effects of North Sea oil are likely to mean that the exchange^     will be higher for the next few years than it would have been otherwise,de    ^G excnange rate moves from its present level will depend on thej Ve*0Pment of the economy as a whole, of which North Sea oil forms anPo*tant, but minor part.
12. Second, unemployment.     Over the 12 months to September 1977domestic output probably increased very little.     The labour force increasedby nearly J million.     Yet employment rose by 100, 000 mainly in manufacturing industry;  unemployment rose by 150, 000 (indeed only 90, 000over 1977 as a whole).    Unfilled vacancies rose by 20, 000; this Januarythey are higher than at any time since March 1975.    No-one in or out of theGovernment predicted this combination of events.     It is impossible to besure what it implies for the future.     If these relationships continue to applythen a growth rate of some 3 per cent would bring about a steady ana lastingfall in unemployment sooner than the traditional arithmetic would suggest.Alternatively, it may be that our special employment measures last year had more effect than we predicted, and that employei s for their own reasonshave been holding onto a larger labour force than they need for current production;  if that were the case, it could on the contrary dampen the effecton employment of this year&apos;s acceleration in the growth rate.13. Third, investment.     We are all agreed on the reed to see moreProfitable investment in productive industry.     But there is no such generalagreement on how best to achieve this.    What is clear is that tne readiness of industrialists to invest depends in part on their general state ofconfidence, in part on their belief that the demand for theii products will be sustained at a level above their existing capacity to supply thern, and In partQn their havino a level of profitability which will provide adequate funds for^vestment now, and reasonable expectations of an adequate return on that^vestment in the future.    In fact private manufacturing investment was*3 per cent higher in the first nine months of 1977 compared with the samePeriod in 1976.assessmentW.        Whatever view one takes of these uncertainties, one thing is certain.lf *e stimulate demand to a degree which seriously outstrips the ability of domestic industry to supply it - either because we are unable to expand out-Put quickly enough, or because we are not sufficiently competitive in price orquality - then the excess demand will result in excessive imports and greater inflationary pressures.     These in turn will drive down the exchanger^te .. possibly drastically if confidence evaporates - and any immediateb*nefit to the current balance would be wiped out by the consequences ofhi8her inflation.    The result would be higher unemployment and a furthererosion of our manufacturing base.I5-       General import controls would provide no easy escape from thatda-nger.    First, to the extent that we succeeded in keeping out imports, the^mediate effect could only be to increase inflation further.    Second, mpractice, as a large net exporter of manufactures, we could only improve0Ur net.balance of external trade, if we avoided damaging retaliation by othereountries.    We would have to win the consent of our major trading partners;lndeed, under the Treaty of Rome we have no legal power to enforce generallr*Port controls, without the consent of the Community.    In our present
circumstances there is no prospect of gaining this consent:  they have much the same unemployment problems as we do;  and they would regard it asparticularly provocative of us to attempt to export our unemployment tothem, at a time when unlike them we are enjoying the unique benefits of north Sea oil.16.        Thus, if we are to stimulate domestic demand in a way whichmaximises domestic output and employment - rather than imports andinflation we must do everything that we can to increase the volume andcompetitiveness of production in Britain.    This depends on many factors.It is not just a question of earnings and the exchange rate;  some of usbelieve that policy has in the past given undue emphasis to these aspects,m the long run, the key to competitiveness is the difference betweenincreases in earnings and increases in productivity - we must ensure thatthis difference is no wider in Britain than among our major trade competitorsWe can achieve this objective just as well in principle, and a great deal more profitably in practice, with high earnings and high productivity growthas with follow earnings and low product!vity growth.    If we cannot get theformer, we must settle for the latter.     What we cannot afford is high^rnings, but continuing low productivity.    That is why we have identifiedProductivity as the prime objective of the industrial strategy, both in thedirectly industrial work being carried forward by the Sector working parties and in our discussion of the wider aspects (CM(77) 34thConclusions, 27 Occober 1977).    It must remain a central objective for the^hole of Government policy in the coming years.l7-        Meanwhile, however - given the strict limits on Governments powerto influence either productivity or the exchange rate, there is no escape from the fact that we must reduce the rate of growth of money incomes.Wage costs remain the key to competitiveness in the short term.    For thecoming year, therefore, I believe that we should concentrate the room forfiscal manoeuvre which we deliberately left last autumn mainly on reductions to the burden of income tax:  and this is where the Trades Union Congress^so have put their first p-ioritv.    For public expenditure we ought to stickto Plans we have just published - including the  1 billion increase which weEnounced last October.    So we must keep any further increases we fee? are^capable within the margin provided by the contingency reserve. Thecase for concentrating on tax relief at this stage is overwhelming.    It willnot only provide the steady and sustained expansion of demand, which is needed to supply the essential incentive for new investment, but will also8tlengthen the incentives for better performance by industry and our exportServices.    Above all, it will create the conditions in which we canrealistically expect working people in the next pay round to settle forearnings increases weU within single figures.    It will give them confidence that they can get a worthwhile increase in their living standards withoutdemanding increase in money wages so high as to send prices and^employment shooting up again.D W Hreasury ChambersJanuary 1978 5
ANNEXECONOMIC OUTLOOK:    CASE TOR REFLATION AND INCREASE in public EXPENDITURE - &quot;MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARYOF STATE FOR SOCTAL SERVICES AND BY THEMINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITYSince originally drafting this note, I have seen the paper by the Secretary of State for Social Services(CP(78)10).   We can discuss his detailed expenditureProposals at the proper time.    However, it may be helpful if I make three general comments now.2.     First, the Secretary of State does not explain theoasis on which he has chosen  3 billion as the correctfiscal stimulus in my spring Budget.    As I have explained above, this is not a figure which we can pluck out of theair.    it must take account of the implications for domesticoutput, for inflation and the monetary aggregates, and forthe balance of payments.    It thus requires a major economicahd political judgement which can be made only after weha-ve had the best available picture of the economicProspect including the new short term forecast, the latestindication of pay settlements over the round, and some ideaof what is happening to the savings ratio.3-     Second, the Secretary of State makes much of ^unplanneddeflati on1 in 1977 !due to massive shortfall in public spending&apos;.    Certainly there seems likely to be an undesirablybiG shortfall in 1977/78 in our spending programmes, asConventionally measured (in survey prices) in the public expenditure White Paper.    However, it is important to keepthis in proportion.    Shortfall is not a new phenomenon and
it has therefore consistently been provided for in our economic and Budget planning, as reflected (for example)in the annual Financial Statement and Budget Report(FSBR).    In the latest year for which we have firm figures -1976/77 - the total cash outturn on public expenditure was within some  100 million of the total provided for on this basis in the 1976 FSBR, and reflected in the estimates ofthe public sector borrowing requirement which we published at the time of the 1976 Budget.    We do not yet have a firmestimate for this year!s outturn (1977/78).   However, thelatest indications are that, discounting the changes inexport credit financing, which do not reflect changes in real activity, the shortfall on this basis is likely tocome out at something under  500 million - or well under1 per cent. &apos;f*.     Third, the Secretary of State suggests that some formsQf public expenditure have the same broad economic effects&amp;8 tax cuts.    This is true only of some forms of expenditure,and then only to a limited extent.   Thus, increases in child benefits can certainly stimulate demand and have somehelpful effect on incentives in the area of the povertytrap, similar to increases in tax thresholds. However,they are unlikely to make the same contribution to our payar*d counter-inflation policies, by buttressing the real takehome pay of those at work.    Indeed, the whole point of takingchild tax allowances away from fathers, and substituting a child benefit payable to mothers, is that in many familieshusband and wife do not share and share alike their severalincomes;    and this is precisely the point which originallyWorried the TUC and persuaded us to phase in child benefitsever a period of time.
