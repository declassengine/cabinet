7WTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)3 OACOPY NO 01/16 January 1978CABINETTHE GREEN POUNDMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food. We need to consider whether to make an immediate green pounddevaluation in the light of parliamentary pressures and the negotiating position on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) prices in Brussels.2. There is now a strong case for action to improve the United Kingdomfarm support price levels and to ease the problems which excessive MRCA(monetary compensatory amount) export *ubsidi*s on supplies fromother European Economic Community (e.c.) countries are causing for the meat processing industry and which could lead to more than three thousandfurther redundancies.    The Annex summarises the key facts including theeffects on food prices.    Although agriculture has had a much better year in1977 the underlying trends are unsatisfactory with the beef and pig breedingherds in particular showing sharp declines.    The difficulties of these twosectors are due in large measure to their having to compete in the UnitedKingdom market with highly subsidised imports of Danish bacon and Irishheef.    The dairy herd is now also starting to fall and investment in agricultural buildings and works is continuing to fall.CAP PRICE NEGOTIATIONS3. In accordance with our strategy towards the CAP our main objective in the price negotiations will be to hold down increases in common prices asclose as possible to the average of 2 per cent proposed by the Commission.An increase of this order will not be sufficient to maintain the productivebase of our own agriculture and we will need to add to it by devaluing the green pound by 5 per cent or more leaving us with an MRCA gap of about* per cent.    The improvement in the competitiveness of our meAtindustryafforded by a reduction in the MCAs which would result from an immediate5 per cent devaluation is, in my view, the minimum that is needed if we areto have a real prospect of arresting the continuing decline in our pig andbeeibreeding herds.    This devaluation would reduce the MRCA subsidy on Danishbacon imports by  43 per tonne (a cut of about 18 per cent) and the net MCAsubsidy on Irish beef imports by  60 per tonne (a cut of about 20 per cent).There are, moreover, great negotiating advantages in making this devaluation^2 ^the Council starts its discussions on CAP prices.    This year, with nofurther transitional steps to increase our support prices and with well knownProblems in certain sectors the other member states will know that we requir.
more than the 2 per cent common price increase.    We need therefore to try to get the green pound issue taken out of the price-fixing to avoid it becoming a lever which other member states can use to achieve their objective of higher common prices.    The French and the Italians, to strengthen theirown tactical positions, are making green currency devaluations before thenegotiations and ii we do the same it will strengthen the general case againstincreased common prices.THE PARLIAMENTARY situation. We have to decide how to deal with the Opposition motion^to be debated on 23 January calling for an immediate devaluation of 7^ per cent.The minor parties seem certain to support this and we run a very real riskof defeat if we cannot announce some change in the green pound.    We could,of course, make no immediate change and continue to argue that it is for theGovernment to judge when and by how much to make a devaluation;  if wewere defeated we could blame the other parties ior the food price increases which would follow.    But I would strongly oppose our surrendering theinitiative in this way.    The credibility of our line on the green pound depends on our being prepared to make some move when circumstances justify it.H wo could announce a 5 per cent change it would be very difficult for theOpposition to argue that it should have been greater and we would haveeffectively defu3cd an issue which will otherwise cause us continuingcriticism and embarrassment over the coming months.TIMING5. We will need to move quicidy to persuade the Commission to table aproposal in time for the Council meeting on 23-24 January.conclusion* I invite the Cabinet to agree that I should immediately askCommissioner Gundelach to table a proposal at the Council on 23-24 Januaryfor a 5 per cent green pound devaluation to be effective on 1 February.JSMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food*6 January 1978
ANNEXECONOMIC DATAAgriculture - general positionAgricultural production has increased by about 25% in 1977 asa result of better weather.   The index of net product (1975 = 100)is as follows1973        197^        1975        1976 1977113 114 100 89 112I arm incomes (excluding stock appreciation) are expected to increase by 16% in money terms in 1978 from  1158 million to  1348 million.In real terms they will have remained about the same.Cost increases in 1977 were much less than in the previous year.The estimated figure is  322.5 million compared with total inputsof  5,500 million.The volume of new investment in agriculture is as follows1973	1974	1975	1976	1977Buildings &amp; Work 104	100	79	64	61Plant &amp; Machinery 91	100	93	101	100Total 97	100	87	85	83Main commodity proauction trends				Milk production in 1977 was some 4J% higher than in 1976 with theincrease coming largely from much better yields.   The dairy herdexpanded by 1% between June 1976 and June 1977 DUt i  nowcontracting again.
Beef production in 1977 is forecast to be about 5% less thanin 1976.   The specialist beef breeding herd fell by 4% betweenJune 1976 and June 1977 and is still declining.Pig production is still falling.   The breeding herd fell by 7%between June 1976 and June 1977*Cereals production reached a record level at nearly 17 milliontonnes.   The acreage was higher than in 1976 but below earlierlevels.   There was no improvement in sugar beet acreage butproduction is expected to have increased by over 30% as a resultof much better weather.Net margins in agricultureOfficials have made a preliminary examination of the possible level of returns to agriculture in 1978 and it is considered thatfor net margins to be maintained at recent levels the followingranges of percentage increases in support prices are indicatedfor the main commoditiesWheat7-9Barley5 -Sugar Beet6-7Beef7-10MiiK4-5   on total returns which can be achievedeither by 10*%   increase on manufacturedprices (which are affected by the greenpound) or by a combination of a smallermanufacturing price increase and some later change in the liquid price
EmploymentTotal employment in the meat processing industry is estimatedat 45,000 of whom about 22,000 are in the pigmeat sector.There have already been 3,000 redundancies in this sector sincemid-1976 and there are at present applications for TemporaryEmployment Subsidy covering a further 3*300 jobs.Estimated effects of 5% devaluation on retail prices of mainfoodstuffsA 5% devaluation would increase the cost of food to the consumerby about 1% after all the effects had worked through.

Increased returns to beef producers are net after higher costs of imported Irish stores,The devaluation is assumed to affect directly only the price of milk for manufacture, accounting for about half of milk delivered from farms.On these bases a 5% devaluation might ultimately add about VA to the average retail price of food.The effects on the average retail price of all items would be about one-quarter of 1%.    The fulleffects on food prices from a devaluation on 1 ittnary would only appear in the course of 1978, asdistributors worked off stocks, and as prices of intensive livestock products adjusted to higherfeed costs.Although the immediate effect on foreign exchange expenditure of the UK would be adverse, therewould ultimately be some saving in foreign exchange expenditure, as higher prices here stimulatedproduction, reduced consumption, and so led to a fall in quantities of imported food.nOz6mZH5
