DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 4!6 January 1978COPY NO80CABINETWHITE PAPER ON AIRPORTS policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade. Following the decision, in July 1974. to abandon the Maplin airportProject, we initiated a wide-ranging review of airports policy.    The aimwas to devise a policy for Great Britain as a whole rather than to rely onpiecemeal solutions and also to ensure that all those affected by airportdevelopments should be involved in the formulation of policy.    A consultationdocument, in two parts, was produced to assist this process.    Part 1,published in November 1975, dealt with airports in the London area and part 2, published in June 1976, considered airports in the rest .t Grea*Britain.    Over 600 organisations and many individuals made representations on these documents and Ministers held meetings with the more importantorganisations.2. A White Paper setting out the Government&apos;s future airports policy isattached.    A draft of the White Paper was considered by the ministerial committee .n Economic and Industrial Policy on 14 December 1977Following clearance by Cabinet, the Committee agreed that the White paper should be published subject to amendment of the reference to the significance of airports strategy for regional development;  to the inclusion of a moreforthright statement about the abandonment of Maplin;  and to further consultation between the Secretary of State for Scotland and me about tneHighlands and Islands aerodromes.    The draft has been amended to take account of the first two points.    With regard to the Highlands and Isian sProdromes, subject to one exception, I agree with the Secretary of State*or Scotland that the future arrangements for these aerodromes should be leitfor the Scottish Assembly to consider.    Sumburgh, in the Shetlandis vital to the oil industry and the exceptional growth of traffic there presentsmanagement problems beyond the experience and abilities of the Civil aviation authority (CAa) which now operates the aerodrome.    These problems arelikely to become more acute and to require aerodrome management skxlls*hich can only be provided by the British Airports Authority.    In my view,responsibility for Sumburgh should be transferred as quickly as possible to*e British Airports Authority.    I invite colleagues to consider this issue.^ the conclusion is that Sumburgh should be transferred to the BnUsh airports authority the square brackets in paragraphs 142, 143 and 163 would be deleted.    On the other hand if it is decided to leave the aerodrome with theCAA the sections in square brackets would be deleted.
3. The White Paper is long, though no more so than previous white papers dealing with airports.    In the light of the extensive consultations,I bslieve it is important that the Government1 s statement should recognise the main arguments that have been deployed and within that context explain the content of the proposed strategy.    Sections 1 -3 provide a basic framework against which decisions rslating to particular airport developmentsshould be considered.    I hope that this will provide a guide to policy formany years to come.    Section 4 contains decisions which are necessarynow on particular developments.    Section 6 is a summary of the principalissues and conclusions.4* Colleagues may wish tc take particular note of the following points:i.       The developments proposed for the London area providecapacity for about 72 million passengers by 1990 compared withthe forecast range of 66-90 million passengers.    There is,therefore, a risk that demand will exceed planned capacity at theend of the 1980s if traffic grows at the highest forecast rate.However, given the considerable uncertainties, set out in theWhite Paper, surrounding the high forecast;   the importance attached tc flexibility   in airports policy;  the need to avoidpossibly premature expenditure on further airport capacity; andthe probability that the devolopments proposed could almost certainly cater for a greater number of passengers if the need arose, I think this is a risk which we should accept.ii.       Outside the London area the policy is one of rationalisation.The White Paper states- clearly that, with the exception of the highlands and Islands, further subsidies for airports will not beprovided and that wasteful competition will not be encouraged.Certain airports are identified as centres for growth.The White Paper makes it clear that the Government will seek to encourage the more rapid development of air services in the regions by their concentration at selected airports, but because the oveiwhelming proportion of passengers live in theSouth East the White Paper rejects suggestions that measures should be introduced to force these passengers to use airportsin the regions.lv*       Although there could be advantages in encouraging thetakeover by the British Airports Authority of the strategicregional airports identified in the White Paper, I believethat in the interest of preserving local and regional autonomy,any transfer of airports should be based on agreement betweenthe British Airports Authority and the local authorities concerned rather than on the direction of central Government.2
v.       Further decisions on airport development are likely to benecessary, especially in the South East, where additional airportcapacity will be needed for the 1990s if air traffic continues to grow.    The White Paper indicates that the Government intends tocontinue to consult widely on these issues and, in particular, to involve the local planning authorities more closely in thepreparation   of policy.5. The proposals in the White Paper minimise expenditure as far aspractical and for the current Public Expenditure Survey period areexpected to be contained within existing provision.6* Publication of the White Paper has been widely anticipated forsome time and before the Recess the House was informed that publicationWas expected early in 1978.    A clear statement of policy is needed toremove present uncertainties affecting many organisations and people,but more importantly to provide the necessary impetus to the transferof traffic from Heathrow to Gatwick and to the Public Inquiry on theproposed fourth terminal at Heathrow, both of which are essential to the handling of London area air traffic in the shorter term.    Cabinet isinvited to approve the White Paper for publication.E d department of Trade17 January 19783

DRAFT WHITE PAPERAIRPORTS POLICYINTRODUCTIONBACKGROUND1        The need to meet the demand for air travel in the london area by building a large new airport on the Naplin sands,in the Thames estuary, 50 miles from London was called intoquestion by four developments in the early 1970s,rapid introduction of large aircraft meant that the majorconstraints at airports in the London area had become the capacityof passenger terminals rather than runways.     Secondly, the newlarger aircraft were markedly less noisy than their predecessors,and international agreement on the permitted noise levels of allJet aircraft suggested that disturbance from aircraft noise&quot;**d be reduced over the comingyears.     Thirdly, the exceptionalrise in the cost of fuel, involving for the airlines a 250 percent increase between 1972 and 197^, resulted in traffic forecastssignificantly below those experienced in the past or considered to he reasonable by the Roskill Commission.     Finally, theeconomic recession of 197^ necessitated a drastic pruning ofexpenditure.PublicAgainst this background, the Government re-assessed the^aplinairport project, which was abandoned.    It also decided^dertake a comprehensive review of airports policy inGt*eat R -britain in consultation with all those concerned. This
review was not concerned with Northern Ireland since thedevelopment of Belfast Airport does not impinge upon theprovision of airport capacity in Great Britain.      Neither was itconcerned with the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.CONSULTATIONS ON AIRPORTS policy        The Roskill Commission produced one of the most thoroughexaminations ever undertaken of the options for a major project of public investment.     Yet the conclusions of the Commission,in a changing economic climate, were shown within a few years to be based on assumptions of rates of growth of air traffic which were unlikely to be achieved, while the pace of technological development and its effects had been more rapidthan expected.     Moreover, the recommendation of the Commission,for a new airport on an inland site at Cublington, was itselfrejected by the Government.     This experience suggested acertain caution, and the need to recognise the wider implication5&apos;in the case of projects involving the commitment of vast publicresources and affecting many millions of people.4-        The Government decided that,for the future, it was essential to ensure that decisions concerning the developmentof particular airports were reached after taking full accountof the views of all those who use, work at, or are affected by,them.     To facilitate this process, and to ensure a widerunderstanding of the issues the Government produced a two partconsultation document &quot;Airport Strategy for Great Britain&quot;.Part 1, published in November 1975, covered the London areaairports and Part 2 published in June 1976 dealt with the region8^
airports.5 Nearly 1000 organisations throughout Great Britain were invited to comment on these documents, including all thelocal authorities concerned, Regional Economic Planning Councils,amenity groups, airlines, airport authorities and employees andother organisations with an interest in airport developments.In addition, a considerable number of other organisations and individuals submitted comments and advice.     The government believes that this approach to the development of airportspolicy has been both necessary and useful.     The advice which,has been received has been virtually unanimous in welcoming the consultation process and endorsing the need to consider airportspolicy in a national context.6 Understandably, a great deal of the advice submittedrepresented the views of special interests such as the users of an airport or those adversely affected by its operations. TheGovernment&apos;s conclusions will not therefore receive universalacceptance.     Nevertheless, it is hoped that as a result of the consultations there will be at least a better unstanding of the decisions which the Government believes to be necessary.Certainly within Government there is a clearer and deeperunderstanding of the position of all those with an interest inairport developments.BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF AIRPORTS POLICY7 In developing its policy the Government has been influenced by six main considerations:      confirmation of the
abandonment of the Maplin airport project;    the role ofthe air transport industry in the national economy; theenvironmental and land use implications of airportdevelopments;    consumer demand;   the more effective use ofexisting airport, road and other infrastructure resources;and flexibility in planning and development which can be related more closely to the growth in demand.     The Governmenthas also considered the employment and the industrial developmentpromoted by airports.8 Until the 1960s, the rapid growth of the air transport industry throughout the world had been little constrained byenvironemental considerations.     Many airports had been built and developed on sites which, had the post wardevelopment of civil aviation been foreseen, would not havebeen acceptable.     while/e the massive investment which has been undertaken cannot be ignored, an increasingly important element of any airports policy must be a recognition of the need totake account of the planning and environmental effects ofairport development and specifically the need to limit as faras possible the impact of aircraft noise on areas surroundingairports.9 However, there needs also to be a proper recognition ofthe contribution which the air transport industry makes to the
United Kingdom economy.     Civil aviation is the dominant formof international passenger transport and plays a role both in domestic transport and in international trade.   During thePeriod which has seen the decline of traditional industries,air transport has been a high growth industry, and is an area inwhich the United Kingdom has retained a strong position in theinternational market.     Air transport not only provides a-K,,,- -i^ an essential partsubstantial benefit to the economy, but is anof the industrial structure of a country that needs to live yits trade with the outside world.     It is also offeringincreasingly wide opportunities for all sections of thecommunity both to enjoy holidays abroad and to visit^ends and relatives living outside the United Kingdom.   A small number 0f those consulted expressed the view that the dis-v noise and associatedbenefits of aviation, in particular aircraft noise ancongestion on the ground, were too high a price to pay. However,the majority accepted that, while there must be a properconsideration of the effects of airports on the surroundingareas, ways should be sought for meeting efficiently the growing consumer demand for air transport.10      Finally, in the present economic climate an important^Wity of any policy should be to establish the most effectiveUs* of existing airports infrastructure and related investment,^rthermore, under conditions of uncertainty, rigid plans wouldbe inappropriate and there is a need therefore for a strategywhioh will seek to balance conflicting interests, and at thes** time allow for change and adaptation as circumstances unfold.
SECTION 1;    THE FRAMEWORK FOR AN AIRPORT STRATEGYINTRODUCTION11 Air traffic demand has remained overwhelmingly concentratedat the four London area airports of Heathrow, Gatwick, Lutonand Stansted which account for about two thirds of all terminalpassengers^ J using airports in Great Britain.     Heathrow alonehandles about half the total terminal passengers and over60 per cent of the international passengers at airports inGreat Britain.     While paragraph 46 suggests that there might begrounds for expecting a growth in demand for air travel in areas outside the South East in the period up to 1990 and beyond,a significant increase in capacity will be required at the london area airports.12 Outside the South East, the problem has been an overprovision of airport capacity and an inability to generatetraffic.     If there is to be an efficient use of the country&apos;resources and encouragement given to the development of viableair services in the regions, a reassessment and rationalisation of the future rolesof the regional airports is required. these general requirements of the London and regional airports havebeen widely recognised by those consulted.TYPES OF AIRPORT13 In establishing a framework for an airport strategy thefirst step is to determine the types of airport required in thevarious parts of the country in relation to the expected demands.(1)   Terminal passengers are those passengers who join or leave a flight at an airport;    they include all passengers excepttransit passengers.
The 1961 White Paper:    Civil Aerodromes and Air NavigationalServices (Cmnd 14-57) suggested that the principal &quot;gateway&quot;airports should be regarded as part of a national airport system-Part 2 of the consultation document &quot;Airport Strategy forGreat Britain&quot; proposed that this concept might merit further development and considered the grouping of airports within a num^eI&quot;of categories.   Comments received during the consultationsindicated some disagreement about the role of particular airports*but there was considerable support for a grouping of airports bycategory as the basis for a national airports strategy, embracingboth the London area and the regions.14 The grouping of airports will not of itself providethe rationalisation of airport facilities which the government believes to be necessary, particularly outside the South East ofEngland.   This will require the implementation of policies on a range of air transport and related matters and on the decisions and involvement of local authorities, local communities andother organisations.   However, with a clear lead from theGovernment on the role of particular airports, the organisations concerned should be able to relate their individual decisions to an overall strategy.15 It is not the Government1s intention to establish arigid plan for airport development, since this would fail torecognise the reality of a changing situation. Furthermore,the definitions of the various categories will need to be interpreted flexibly since they will not necessarily be precise^
relevant to all airports over a period duringNhich the role of individual airports might change.    It isessential therefore that the basic framework should be capable01 adaptation to meet changing circumstances and that anyEdification shouldbe the subject of consideration with those concerned.In the light of comments received during the consultationsne Government has adopted the following categories of airports Part of the framework for airports policy.^     gateway International AirportsThese airports would provide or be expected to supportover time, a wide range and frequency of internationalservices, including inter-Continental services anda full range of domestic services.BRegional AirportsThese airports would cater for the principal air trafficdemands of individual regions, parts of regions or groups of regions outside the South East.   They would be concerned essentially with the provision of a network ofshorthaul scheduled international services;    a significantrange of charter services;    and domestic services includinglinks withgateway airports.     The scheduled internationalservices would be primarily on the more popular routes to europe or related to the special associations which exist
between some countries and parts of Great Britain,for example, between Scandinavia and North East Englandand Scotland.C       Local AirportsThese airports would provide third level services^ &apos;catering primarily for local needs, concentrating on(2) .general aviation^ &apos;with some domestic feeder servicesand some charter flights.D      General Aviation AerodromesThese would be concerned primarily with the provisionof general aviation facilities.THE IMPljjMENTATION OF AN AIRPORTS POLICY17        It is not the Government&apos;s intention to dictate toairlines and airport authorities the precise conditions underwhich they should operate, but to give the maximum scope for commercial decision.     However, it is its objective to ensure,as far as possible,that the decisions and policies of theaviation authorities and local authorities are consistent with ^enational airports strategy.     The framework in this White paper and the developments envisaged over the period to 1990, should provide a guide to those policies and decisions.18        The implementation of airports policy will require theco-operation of many authorities and a positive role for theGovernment.     First, the Government will take account of airpor^5(1) Third level services are usually defined as those scheduledpassenger services operated by aircraft with fewer than 25seats.(2) General aviation encompasses all forms of civil aviationother than the operations of major airlines and includesbusiness and recreational flying and flying training.
Policy in issuing permits for scheduled and charter services by ov(CAA)Dy overseas operators.     Secondly, the Civil Aviation authority in considering applications by British operators for newair Services and for renewals of existing licences will beexPected to take account of airports policy in accordanceV;ith Paragraph 14 of the guidance contained in the White Paper:*future Civil Aviation Policy of February 1976 (Cmnd 6400).^hirc*ly, the Government&apos;s policy of encouraging the growth oflr Services at regional airports outlined in paragraph 22,lH be related to the overall objectives of airports policy.0urthly, at publicly owned airports the authorities concerned^1 be expected to relate the development of their airports tothe Qrjovernment&apos;s airports policy as well as to the criteria whichDay f from time to time apply to public sector projects. Fifthly,So far as planning procedures may be relevant, the local^Ut Yi0rities concerned will be expected to have regard toPOrts Policy in their consideration of proposals fordeveioPment at and around airports.     Finally, the Government&apos;sPoUcies relating to employment and to the provision of roads,6 and other forms of infrastructure will have regard to*irports policy.R0LE 0f REGIONAL DIVERSION19The transfer of some part of the growth in air traffic,^-Kht otherwise take place in the South East, to otherwould have two main benefits.     First, it would help toU*ve dPressure on resources in the South East and secondly, itco -Qntribute to the Government1s regional development policies.50Comments during the consultations on the diversion
of traffic to regional airports indicated a widespread,but not universal, rejection of any policy to require passengerswith origins and destinations in the South East to use airportsoutside the region.     Many of the amenity groups and localauthorities in the South East felt that the same consideration should be given to the environmental costs as to the costs tothe air transport industry and to passengers of diverting traffic to regional airports.     In addition, many provincial organisation^&apos;while accepting that a large scale diversion of London areapassengers was unrealistic, considered that greater attention should be given to attracting back to regional airports passenger5currently using London&apos;s airports because of the lack of suitableservices from regional airports.   It was also suggested that the(A)propensity to fly       in the regions other than the South East,which is about two-fifths of that in the South East, would incre^s6relatively in the future;    that there was scope for attractingincreasing numbers of foreign tourists direct to these regions;and that provided the airlines were given sufficient encouragement&apos;these additional demands could lead to a greater contribution fro10the regional airports to the handling of total air traffic demand in Great ,Britain.21        The Government, which has consistently emphasised theimportance it attaches to the greater use of regional airports,has given particular consideration to the representations whichhave been made.    In an area where facts and forecasts are more(1) Propensity to fly is the number of international flights byresidents in a particular year with origins and destinationsin a particular region per head of population in that region
than usually uncertain, the Government considers that particularcaution is necessary in predicting over a fifteen year period the reactions of individuals to various economic stimuliand economic and social trends.     Bearing in mind that at thePresent time 80 per cent of terminating passengers at Londonairports have origins and destinations in the South East, anyforced diversion of traffic, to have a significant effect on*ir traffic demand in the South East, could involve the imposition** substantial charges on passengers using London airports. TheGovernment rejects the suggestion that the air transport industrys*ould be subject to the damaging restrictions on its operations,which would be the outcome of the forced diversion of traffic to regional airports.22Nevertheless, the Government believes that there are aberthe Londoi ways in which a greater role for airports outsidethat -on area can be achieved.   First, the Government considerse pursuit of a coherent airports policy should make a positive contribution to an overall increase in traffic fromtile regions outside the South East.   A proportion of thosePassengers presently using the London airports, but with originsdestinations outside the South East would be prepared to useairports elsewhere if the right services, at the right time, andthe right frequency were available.   Such services are-Likely to be commercially viable if they are operated from almited range of airports.     The avoidance of wastefulco^Per -i -ultion between regional airports, if this can be assured,Provide some incentive to airlines to mount services fromthe mre important regional airports.     Secondly, it should belDle to achieve a greater use of regional airports byPoSs^
chart*/and leisure traffic.     Leisure trips, and particularlyinclusive tours by United Kingdom residents, already show a moreeven distribution of origins and destinations than other servicesand there could be scope for greater market development outsidethe South East.     Tour operators should become increasinglyaware of the advantages of providing services from the regionalairports, and perhaps also for the most popular destinationsfrom local airports.     Thirdly, incoming leisure traffic, although a high proportion continues to travel by sea, is likely tobe the fastest growing sector of air travel.     The great majorityof foreign visitors come to London, but nearly half their time is spent in other parts of the country and the British TouristAuthority and other tourist boards are already following policiesdesigned to spread tourism more widely.   Furthermore, the choice of London as the main base for foreign leisure visitors maydecline as the number of visitors rises, congestion in theLondon area increases, and the relative price advantage of otherparts of the country becomes more attractive.23        The London area airports handle an even higher percentageof the country&apos;s international air cargo than of internationalpassengers, although the proportion of cargo with origins ordestinations in the South East is lower than for passenger traf^CHowever, the fact that over half the cargo at Heathrow is carriedon passenger flights, together with the attractiveness of thegreater frequencies and range of destinations at the Londonairports, the significant economies of scale available by concentrating traffic at a small number of airports, and thepractice of moving cargo by road from regional airports to
London airports, limits seriously the scope for diverting cargoto regional airports.24 It has been suggested that an all cargo airport shouldbe established outside the South East, but this suffers fromthe same fundamental difficulty of the close links betweencargo and passenger traffic.     The Government does not considerthat an all cargo airport is a practicable proposition at this time.     The attraction back to regional airports of cargo traffic at present travelling through the London area airports, must dependprimarily on the growth of international passenger services fromregional airports.    In view of the economies of scale in cargohandling facilities and the need for frequent services and a wide range of destinations, there is a clear need for air cargoactivities outside London to be concentrated at a small number ofairports.    It will be the Government&apos;s policy therefore toencourage the provision of adequate freight facilities at thoseairports identified as having a significant role in thenational airports strategy.25 Paragraph 18 emphasised the need for co-operation among all those concerned if a national airports policy is to be effec-tive.     This will be particularly important in enhancing the role of regional airports and the Government will seek toco-ordinate this co-operation.    In the case of the regionalairports it will be the Government&quot;s objective to promote the changes outlined in paragraphs 22 and 24, but results will take some time.     A switch in traffic from the South East to other areas of Great Britain is likely to develop over the period to1990, but it will not avoid the need for additional airportcapacity in the London area.CONFIDENTIAL
AIRPORT CAPACITY LIMITATIONS26 Within the consultation process many local authoritiesdrew attention to the need to avoid in the future the &quot;creepingexpansion&quot; of airports which they have contended has been acharacteristic of the past and to establish &quot;ceilings&quot; on thegrowth of particular airports.     This would provide the localauthorities with a firm basis for their urban development,infrastructure planning and related policies, and at the sametime contain the environmental impact of airport development andair transport operations.     There were suggestions that these&quot;ceilings&quot; should be defined by reference to passenger and cargothroughputs, air transport movementsv    , numbers employed at the airport, or levels of aircraft noise.27 The Government recognises these arguments.     However, witkthe growth of air traffic, the future level of noise disturbanceand many other factors inevitably uncertain and with the current economic situation imposing tight constraints on public expenditure, airport capacity must be provided only in so faras demand can be foreseen with reasonable confidence. Theimposition of rigid quantitative limitations on the capacity ofairports would not be compatible with that approach, neitherwould it be practical nor necessarily useful to those affectedby airport development.     If limitations below the capacity ofairports were established in terms of the number of passengersor aircraft handled in a year, it is not easy to visualisehow operations could be sustained and the credibility of theceilings maintained, when the prescribed limits had been reached&apos;(1) An air transport movement is a landing or a take off by an aircraft operating a scheduled or non-scheduled service.
The rates of technological development and design changesin airports in recent years have demonstrated the difficultiesin attempting to predict the anticipated capacity of separateelements of an airport&apos;s infrastructure.28 While this suggests the need for a step by step approach to airport development, the Government is anxious to respond tothe arguments which have been advanced and to provide somereassurance of the kind local authorities are seeking on theultimate capacity of airports.     The Government therefore acceptsthat limits on the development of airports must be an important part of its strategy throughout Great Britain.   The government believes that this can best be achieved by a combination of restrictions on the number of terminals that can be provided atan airport;    through arrangements for the monitoring anddevelopment of future airports policy, which will involve thelocal authorities;    and through the modification of the british airports Authority (BAA) General Development Order (GDO)planning provisions, particularly as they relate to terminaldevelopments.     The strategy presented in this White Paperincorporates each of these elements.FINANCE AND OWNERSHIP29 Policy on the provision of Government financial support for airport development, as well as ownership, was laid down inthe 1961 White Paper.   This envisaged that the air transport industry should become self-sufficient in the longer term.The White Paper recognised that a number of small aerodromes,notably in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, were essential
to the economy and social welfare of the areas they served,that they were never likely to pay their way and that theymight need to be supported by means of a direct subsidy. TheWhite Paper also recognised that some financial assistance fromthe Exchequer might be justified for a period, where an airportserved a national as well as a local need, and where the costof running the airport would place an unduly heavy burden on local resources.   The Government does not consider that thereis any justification for air transport facilities in general to be subsidised by the taxpayer and the ratepayer. Consequently&apos;while it accepts the need, on social grounds, to secure thecontinued operation of a limited number of small aerodromes,particularly in the Highlands and Islands, which provide anessential service to the local communitybut which are not likelyto become viable in the foreseeable future, the government considers that the air transport industry has now advanced tothe stage at which new commitments to financial assistance fromthe Exchequer for airport development, or for the acquisitionof airports, will only be justified in wholly exceptional circumstances.30 The 1961 White Paper concluded that the Gateway airportsshould beowned and managed by a separate airports authority,and the British Airports Authority was subsequently setup to own and operate the principal international airports at heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Prestwick.     Part 2 of the consultation document suggested that in the light of both the1961 White Paper and the possible future development of theairports system, the role of the BAA might be expanded by theAuthority&apos;s acquisition of the principal airports which at
present it does not own and operate.     A number of advantages of such a policy were put forward.     First, that the longer term development of gateway international airoorts would requirethe sort of airport management, technical and operationalexpertise which, in the case of local authority owned airports,may imp0se demands on financial and other resources beyond thecompass of the present owners.     Secondly, that consistentfinancial, management and investment policies for majorinternational airports would he an important part of a nationalairport strategy and common ownership might facilitate this.Thirdly, the concentration of activity at a number of airportsmight be given encouragement by ownership by the british airports Authority.31 In the course of the consultations, those authorities concerned with airports which seemed likely to be candidates for acquisition by the British Airports Authority were for themost part opposed to or had reservations about losing controlQf their airoorts.     While recognising the need for a national^policy towards airports they emphasised the widespread opposition*o over-centralisation and drew attention to the acceptance inthe consultation documents that the local authority ownedairports have been efficiently operated.     It wasalso pointedout that there was advantage in local responsibility andcontrol and responsiveness to local needs.     Finally, it wasarSued that consistency of airport authority policies wouldderive from the formulation of a national policy and did not depend on ownership by the British Airports Authority.32 In the light of the views expressed during the consulta-tions, the Government has concluded that a coherent airports
policy derived from the framework provided by this White Paper,is not dependent on major changes in ownership.     Local authori-ties will, of course, need to take into account the implications of the Government policy set out in paragraph 29. in circumstances where there is agreement on the desirability ofBAA ownership between the local authority owners concerned and the BAA and where this would be consistent with theGovernment&apos;s strategy, the Government will consider proposals made for changes in ownership.      Insuch cases the Governmentwill attach particular importance to ensuring an effective localvoice in the operation of any airports which the BAA mightacquire.33        Losses at local authority airports in England and Walesare currently running at  5-6 million a year.     While the subsidies for some Highlands and Islands services are a particularexception the Government sees no general justification forsubsidising airports and air services.     At the airports whichwill remain under local authority control the Government willcontinue to urge economies and the application of policies aimed at reducing financial losses as effectively as possible. Inparticular, as a general rule the Government will expect proposal5for improving these airports to be postponed until the economicsituation allows some growth in local authority expenditure.AIRPORT CHARGES34-        Part 2 of the consultation document suggested that onefactor contributing to losses at regional airports had beenthe adoption of uneconomic charging policies.     It had beenargued that the major airports in Great Britain were part ofa common system to which common airport charges should be
applied.     During the consultations a number of airportauthorities expressed their opposition to increased charges for air navigation services by the Civil Aviation Authority,which, they pointed out, were very much higher at regionalairports than at airports in the London area and thus werereinforcing the existing pattern whereby landing and other charges at the BAA&apos;s London airports are generally lower thanthose elsewhere.     The regional airport authorities contended that differential increases of this kind were not consistent with the Government&apos;s wish to encourage the growth of traffic at regional airports.35       The Government&apos;s consideration of these matters hasbeen influenced by three principles.     First, the government does not consider that air travel generally should be subsidised by the taxpayer and ratepayer and believes thatcharges should reflect the cost of providing airport services.Secondly, airport revenues should be adequate to provide for^e continued existence, including replacement and a return011 capital, of the facilities.     Thirdly, and within these principles and the constraints of anti-inflation and competitionPolicy, the setting of airport charges should remain a^tter for airport managements.     In consequence, the government considers that the substantial deficits which have been incurredat some airports are Consistent with the principle that airtravel should not be subsidised by the non-travelling public.Xt rejects any suggestion that exchequer subsidies should bebailable generally to support the operation of airports.56       It is recognised that since airports have a high level
CONFIDENTIALof fixed capital, average unit costs are very dependent on traffic levels and this can give large established airports aconsiderable advantage.     Moreover, it may often be difficultto define the marginal costs of providing airport services,particularly where these are supplied centrally or where thereare large overhead costs.     However, the Government is not convinced that airport landing and related charges are a material influence on the level of traffic at an airport. they represent a very small proportion of total aviation costs and theextent to which airlines have a choice of airport is frequentlyover-estimated.     Thus, while differential airport chargesmay be of some significance in the competition between airportsserving a similar catchment area and in influencing the spread oftraffic between peak and off-peak periods, the effect on theattractiveness of the regional airports in general is negligible.37     The Government is conscious of the difficulties causedby the recent large increases in charges.     It recognises alsothe criticisms of the diversity of charges with airport landingfees, which are often themselves complex, being supplemented by charges for air navigation services, security and aerodromelicensing.     It has been suggested that this multiplicity of charges should be replaced by a simplified charging system.The Government understands the force of this argument but itbelieves also it is important that the justification for particular charges should be understood and that theyshould bekept generally in line with costs.     Charging systems shouldbe a matter primarily for airport managements, and the otherproviders of services.     However, the Government will keepaviation charges under review to ensure, amongst other things,that the policies adopted are generally consistent with the
overnment&apos; s overall airports strategyFUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY38    The consultations revealed considerable anxiety aboutPossible longer term airport developments if the growth of demand, particularly in the London area, does not sooner or laterbegin to level off.     Concern on this question is understandable,but the problem flows from uncertainties which are inherent in forecasting air traffic demands and translating these intoacceptable airport developments.     In these circumstances theGovernment acknowledges that a necessary part of any airports^egy will be to maintain close liaison with local authoritiesand others concerning the future of particular airports. Moreover,the roles envisaged for different airports may change over timeand in the London area, in particular, it will be necessary toinsider the provision of additional capacity either at existingairports or at a new airport in the not too distant future.59    It will be the Government&apos;s intention to continue to consultthose concerned with the development of airports policy intbe longer term.     In this connection a number of local planning authorities, mainly through the Standing Conference on London andS^th East Regional Planning, have represented that they shouldbe aore closely associated with the identification of futureairport development options that may figure in future consulta-tions.    The Government recognises the particular interest of thelocal planning authorities and intends, therefore, to discuss^bh the local authority associations an appropriate formalstructure that will allow these interests to be taken intoacc^nt in the formulation of advice on the longer term options0r airport policy.
THE FRAMEWORK40 The recent Transport Policy White Paper (Cmnd 6836)announced the setting in hand of a study of the longer term demandfor domestic inter-urban public passenger transport by rail,bus and air, witha view to improving co-ordination of operators&apos;pricing policies and investment plans.     Investment in airportcapacity is primarily needed in response to growth in international air traffic, and to this extent the study will have only limitedrelevance to the issues dealt with in this White Paper. However?the study will provide a useful contribution to the developmentof forecasts of domestic air traffic over the next 10 - 20 years*The planning of airport facilities to meet air transport demandsmust proceed in concert with developments in domestic surface transport and the Government will ensure that the Departmentsinvolved continue to work closely together in this area of planning.THE FRAMEWORK41 Within the need to determine how the demand for air transport in South East England can be accommodated and howairport facilities in other areas of Great Britain can be usedmore extensively, the airports strategy framework, involving the division of airports into four broad categories, will bebased on six guidelines.(i)   The rationalisation and concentration of theprincipal air services at a limited number ofairports outside the South East.(ii)   Acknowledgment of the need for flexibility in policy ratherthan the adoption of a rigid plan forall airports.
(iii) The development of policies on air servicelicences and permits, onthe expansion of airports,and on planning and related matters consistent withairports policy.(iv) Recognition that the diversion of traffic to regional airports is unlikely to have any significant effort on the demand for airport capacity in theSouth East.(v) Acceptance of the need to identify the limits ofan airport&apos;s development.(vi) Acknowledgment of the need to develop further theprocess of consultation on airports strategy.basic to the application of these guidelines will be the principlethatair transport facilities should not in general be-^-o-ised by the taxpayer or ratepayer.
SECTION 2:    AIR TRAFFIC FORECASTSINTRODUCTION^2       in assessing the demand for airport capacity, and in determining the airport developments which might he required,might be provided and might he acceptable, it is necessary toquantify the level of demand.     Because of the lead timesinvolved in the provision of major additions to airport capacity,it is essential to provide forecasts of passenger and cargo demandcovering the period 10 to 15 years ahead.     Forecasting overso long a time scale, whether of air transport or of anyother area of economic activity, involves considerableuncertainties and the basic forecasts are no better than the assumptions on whichthey are based and the methodology adopted.The methodology used for the forecasts in the consultationdocuments produced results whictiwere not significantlychallenged during the consultation process. Nevertheless,it is important, and it will be the Government1 s intentionto monitor the present forecasts in line with the developmentof traffic, to keep the assumptions and methodology underreview, and to prepare forecasts for the late 1990s and beyond.
U3        The passenger traffic forecasts prepared for the MaplinReview and the consultation documents were based on the trafficlevels of .1972 and covered the period to 1990.      Actual trafficlevels since 1972 reached a peak in 1973 followed by arecession in 1974* which interrupted a continuous pattern of growth since 1945*     Traffic began to recover in 1975 and by1976 had exceeded 1973 levels.     The traffic levels during these years are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Terminal Passengers at Airports in Great Britain 1972-74Millions of Passengers.	1972	1973	1974	1975	1976Heathrow	13.3	20.3	20.1	21.3	23.2Gatwick	5.3	5.7	5.1	5.4	5.7Stansted	0.3	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.3Luton	3.1	3.2	2.0	1.9	1.8Total London Airports	27.0	29. 4	27. 4	28.8	31.other airports in England and Wales	7.3	8.3	7.4	7.7	7.8Scottish airports	3.6	4.1	4.0	4.2	4.8Total Great Britain	37.9	Ul.8	38.8	40.7	43.6
A REVIEW OF THE FORECASTSWi        Since the preparation of the forecasts for the consultation documents, a review of the assumptions and themethodology has been carried out.     This has involved a^consideration and re-estimation of all the main assumptionsused in building up the national forecasts and an attempt toestablish a more comprehensive explanation of past growth.Taking this work into account,revised forecasts for GreatBritain have been prepared and these are shown in Table 2. The*ase year has been updated from 1972 to 1975 and forecasts have*een produced for five year intervals up to 1990.     The positionbeyond 1990 has also been considered.     Growth in traffic isexpected to continue, but the prospects for the 1990s and beyondare a matter of particular uncertainty especially in view of the developments discussed in paragraphs U7-u10.I^Lg 2:    Air Passenger Demand in Great BritainMillions of Passengerseional AirportsInternational19752k.93.95.36.6197626.8U.25.67.01980Low32. kU.36.27.0High37.17.37.91985LowU6.35.18.87.9High57.16.U11.69.71990Low High!60.

us     The main changes resultSQ^om^WS^eviev: of the earlierforecasts are a somewhat lower overall expectation of growth inthe period up to 1990 and a narrowing cf the range between thelow and high forecasts.     The most significant reduction occursin the high end of the forecast range.     These changes resultpartly from revisions in the assumptions for economic growth and fuel prices and partly from the reassessment of the price and income elasticities.     A more critical review of thecompatibility of the various assumptions has also been carriedout, the results of which have led to a narrowing in the range of forecasts.Within the air traffic forecasts, the proportion of passengers expected to use the London area airports is ofparticular significance, since it is there that the maincapacity problems are expected to arise.     Table 3 analysesboth the traffic in 1975 and the forecasts for the London area in terms of the nationality of the passengers and the purposeof their journeys.     The forecasts for international traffichave been arrived at by assuming for the London airports as awhole a constant share of the total Great Britain traffic ineach passenger category.      The forecasts and particularly the domestic forecasts, take account of competition from surfacetravel.     The assumption of a constant share in each category of international traffic, although it leads to small fluctuations in the total London share of international  traffic becauseof the different rates of growth in the various categories,implies a fairly stable 80 per cent share for the Londonairports up to 1990.     Overall, with the addition of domestictraffic the London area airports shar. of total traffic couldrise slightly over time on these assumptions.     The realism
CONFIDENTIALof a constant share assumption for international traffic is open to question.     The London area proportion mightPall over time, as the attraction of the other regions toforeign tourists and businessmen, the propensity to fly inthe other regions, and the availability of services atregional airports, increase.     However,  there is as yet no evidence of any clear trend in this respect and, while theGovernment accepts that this proportion could change, it isPrudent for forecasting purposes to retain the assumption thatthe proportion of international passengers using the Londonairports will remain stable.?orecast International &amp; Domestic Passenger Demand ^London Ar*ftfl AirportsMillions of Passengers
REALISM 0? FORECASTSU7     The inherent uncertainty of any attempt at forecasting hasalready been acknowledged, but there are two particulai4 areas where some degree of judgement has been exercised and a thirdto which particular reference should be made.     First, the fore-casts will be affected if certain air travel markets begin toshow signs of Saturation&apos;.     While there is little indication that this point has been reached, there has been considerabledebate within the air transport industry on the extent to whichthe upper limit of market growth can be identified.     The rapidrates of growth, such as were seen for Inclusive Tours in the1960s, represented the successful development of a new market,but the size of this market for leisure travel is limited notonly by economic factors, but also by other constraints such as available time and family structure.      For these reasons rapid growth in the leisure market cannot be expected to continue indefinitely.     ^his effect has been incorporated into theforecasting model by assuming a decline over time in thesensitivity of demand to price and income changes.      As a result?a tailing off in the growth in demand appears in the forecasts,but it has not been possible to identify any clear upper limit.Nevertheless, by the 1990s the effects of saturation may well be significant, particularly at the high end of the forecast range and especially in the South East where market penetration has proceeded further than in other areas of the country.2+8 Secondly, there is the question of whether the very largecomponent of foreign leisure passengers forecast in the 1980s
Will be attracted to and can be accommodated within the london area.     Foreign leisure passengers represent a significantProportion of the forecast total international demand at theLondon area airports in 1990, or around 32 million passengermovements with the high forecast.   This would imply that about16 million leisure passengers will be arriving at and departing from the London area airports in 1990, compared with 5 million at present, and it is likely that a high proportion of them&quot;ill spend at least some of their time visiting London. TheGovernment is considering the implications which suchPossibilities could have for tourism policy, but it is alreadyevident that such a demand could not be accommodated in LondonWithout a substantial expansion of the existing stock ofhotel and other accommodation over- the next 15 years.     It is^likely that such expansion would occur without a real increasein the level of hotel tariffs, which would in turn lead to some^auction in tourist demand, and it may be doubted Whether there be the space available in Central London to meet the higherend of the forecast demand.     It is also probable that the congestion at the main tourist attractions will lead to someEduction in demand.     It is not possible to forecast the preciseimpact of these effects on air traffic demand, but a reductionin the incoming leisure component for the London area of 10-15cent by 1990 might not be unrealistic.     This could reducethe high 1990 forecast by up to 5 million passengers.Thirdly, the possibility must be recognised that there will
be an upward trend in oil prices over the next 15 years,.Estimates of the timing vary, with some experts predictingsignificant further movement from the early 1960s. the traffic forecasts assume up to a 50 per cent increase in fuelprices in real terms by 1990.      If fuel prices were to exceedthis level there would be some further reduction in demandfor air travel.CARGO FORECASTS50     Although the volume of United Kingdom trade carried by air is small, amounting to less than i per cent of the total,the value is high.     Over the past 15 years the value ofUnited Kingdom trade by air has increased from  526 million,representing 6 per cent of the total to  3,56U million in 1976or 15 per cent of total United Kingdom trade.     Growth in aircargo was badly affected by the cut back in trade following the fuel crisis, but there was no fall in air cargo&apos;s share ofthe total va6ae of United Kingdom trade.      Over the period to1990 it i.s expected that there will be further grov/th in aircargo and that it will continue to account for a growing partof the value of our trade.51     Air cargo is transported both on all-cargo services andin the holds of passenger-carrying aircraft.      The development and introduction of wide-bodied jets has increased the spaceavailable for cargo on passenger services and has limited thegrov/th of all-cargo services.     In recent years all-cargoCONFIDENTIAL
movements have accounted for a fairly stable 8-9 per cent ofthe total air transport movements in the London area.     In thefuture, although the tonnage could increase by as much as -10 per cent a year, there is not expected to be any major change in the proportion of freight carried on all-cargomovements.
ggCTIOII 7*:    THIS&apos;AIRPORT BKV1R0NMENTINTRODUCTION52     The Airport Strategy consultation document emphasised theimportance which the Government attaches to the environmentalimplications of airport developments.     Substantial sectionsQf both parts of the document were devoted to the way in whichdifferent developments might affect the communities surroundingthe airports and many of the comments were concerned withenvironmental matters.53     During the consultations some organisations ar2ued thatenvironmental factors should dictate airports strategy, thatthe Government should decline to meet the demand for airportfaoilltie8, or that airports should he sited at a considerable distance from centres of population.     Such approaches leaveout of account the benefits to be derived from an efficientair transport system and fail to meet the reasonable needs ofindustry.     Furthermore, What are sometimes described as&quot;environmental airports&quot; away from centres of population are^ no means universally acceptable as experience in this .country and elsewhere has shown.
54     Notwithstanding the predicted reductions in aircraftnoise disturbance which were explained in the consultationdocument, aircraft noise emerged as a matter of widespreadconcern.     The Government recognises the genuine anxietieswhich exist and, although it remains confident that theintrodcution of new and quieter aircraft will bring increas-ingly dramatic improvements in the situation, it will coniinulto maintain and develop a range of ameliorative measures as essential component of its airports strategy.      In theGovernments view the maximum value from direct measures, sucftas those governing aircraft noise abatement procedures and tftnoise certification of aircraft, can only be realised if theyare supported by firm and v/idely understood policies coveringamong other things, the identification of those airports whe&quot;ethe main growth in traffic is to be concentrated; the definition of aircraft flight paths;    and the control, underthe Town &amp; Country Planning Acts, of residential and othernoise sensitive developments in areas subject to aircraftnoise.n55     A key role of an airport strategy is to provide a framework for a co-ordinated approach by the many interestswho can influence the way environmental problems are tackled-&apos;Nevertheless, the consultations confirmed the existence of 811apparently inescapable clash of interests, which has aopeareain its most acute form when proposals for new airports havebeen presented.     On the one hand, there is a legitimate
demand that aircraft noise and congestion should be minimisedin the heavily populated urban areas that are affected bythe existing busy &quot;city&quot; airports such as Heathrow, Manchester,Birmingham and Glasgow.     On the ottisr hand, there isJustifiable, and ofteftwell articulated, resentment among the relatively much smaller populations who live in areas whichretain some rural character and which are seen to be threatenedhy increased use of airports situated in more open areas,^presentations on this score have highlighted particularresistance to the introduction or intensification of aircraftnoise m areas which are claimed to have relatively low ambient&quot;oise levels;   to the imposition of heavy traffic on country^ds;   and to changes of character in an area that can hebought about by     new house building and associated develop-ments needed to accommodate those involved in the running ofthe airport and in service and related activiti ,.AIRCR^ POISE56only did the consultations confirm that, of all theems associated with airports, the disturbance caused by*Ur(theaipcraf*-f-u noise remains the most serious, but they reaffirmedArticular severity of the problem around Heathrow. AtPresentusing the Noise and Number Index (KNI) as a guide,tllin tne 35 N.N.I. contour 2 million people are affected by
aircraft noise at Heathrow compared with around U50,000 at allthe other principal airports in Great Britain considered inthe consultation documents.     By 1990 the number of peopleaffected around Heathrow is forecast to decline to less than300,000 due mainly to the v/ider use of larger quieter aircrai&quot;*hut even so the problem will still be greater at Heathrow th&amp;elsewhere in the country.     This has been a major consideratein the development of an airport strategy for the South east england.57     Many of the comments received during the consultationsdrew attention to the alleged shortcomings of the Noise and number Index as a measure of noise disturbance. TheGovernment accepts that there are deficiencies in the UNI.However, in the absence of an alternative which is as widely accepted, and which will permit a comparative examination ofdifferent airports over an extended period, the government considers that the N.N.I. remains as good a measure of aircraftdisturbance as is available.     A fundamental change in thesystem would make comparisons with the past difficult to assesand monitor.     Nevertheless, there is general agreement bothin the United Kingdom and elsewhere that there would be benef-1-in the adoption of a uniform scale for the measurement ofnoise disturbance.     It is, therefore, the governments intention to continue, in consultation with those concerned, &apos;Jexamine po33ible alternatives to the N.N.I., including the Seal6
of Equivalent Continuous Sound Level (Lee.).     The Leu. covers allforma of noise and has certain advantages over the N.N.I.. Itwould, for example, include helicopter noise which was thesubject of particular concern in the consultations, and for&quot;hich the Government is keen to establish a reliable basis formeasurement in order to assess the scale of the problem.58    It is accepted that the reaction of individual people tonoise varies greatly and this was shown in the surveys fromwhich the N.N.I. was developed.     However, for purposes of compari-son the reaction of an &quot;average person&quot; has been adopted and inthis context the 35 N.N.I. is generally taken to represent a level*? &quot;low annoyance&quot; to aircraft noise.     It is recognised thatoutside the 35 N.N.I. contours there are people whose reaction to^craft noise is more acute than that of the average persona^ that in consequence they suffer more annoyance. Wherecomplaints suggest that there may be circumstances whichexacerbate the aircraft noise problem outside the 35 mil contour,8Pecial investigations will continue to be made.     It has beentested that one of the main reasons for the apparent disturb-ence caused by aircraft in certain areas some distance fromSports is the lower ambient noise levels to be found in thoseWacee.     vmile there is a need to balance the impact of aircraft, the Government acknowledges that the perception of aircraftmay be more acute in areas where the general environment isvery quiet, but this needs to be weighed against thenoiSenoisehormaliyde3ij,a- . ..unity of causing disturbance to as few people as5oasible.
5(i     Regardless of the way annoyance from aircraft noise ismeasured, and notwithstanding the special case of Concorde,the essential conclusion of the work undertaken for the airpor&quot;strategy consultation documents was that over the next 15 year*there would be a marked decline in the degree and extent ofdisturbance from aircraft noise.     Certain of the assumptionson which the noise forecasts were based were criticised in the consultations.     It was suggested that the forecasts assumed 8rate of introduction for the newer generation of quieter and larger aircraft that was unlikely to be achieved.      It wasconsidered that the forecast average number of passengers Peraircraft, which through its influence on the number of air transport movements ha3 a significant effect on the noiseforecasts, was too optimistic.      It was implied, particularly by those concerned with the regional airports which have see*relatively few of the nev/ generation of jets, that these aircraft were not in fact significantly quieter than thosecurrently in use.60     The forecasts for the introduction of new aircraft are based not on a simple extrapolation of past trends, but ondetailed analysis of airline fleets including:    the ages ofexisting aircraft;    the known retirement plans of the airl**jthe likely demands of the world1s airlines;    and the new aircraft which are being, or are expected to be^ developed.Leaving aside for the moment the earlier retirement of vioi**
aircraft, which the Government is actively pursuing withinthe European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), it is forecastthat by the late 1980s all but a small proportion of existingairline fleets will have to be replaced.     These replacementsnil not necessarily be wide bodied aircraft, but irrespective of their configuration they will be required to meet, at least the then current noise certification standards. british airways is giving greater priority in its fleet planning tothe replacement of its Tridents with new, quieter aircraft.The new aircraft would complement British Airways fleet of**istar aircraft, which is one of the quietest of the modernderation of wide bodied aircraft, and a major considerationits selection would be noise performance.     This would produce a significant reduction in noise disturbance in thevioinity of Heathrow and other airports presently served by *T*ident aircraft.So far as the noise characteristics of the new generationjet aircraft are concerned there is no doubt that these showsubstantial improvement on earlier aircraft.     For example, at^e n.oise certification measuring points under the flight path^ ^^oise certification points are 6.5 km from the start of&amp;Ke-off and 2.0 km from the runway threshold on approach; ere ia an additional point used in certification tests tothe side of the ta.:e-off path.
a Boeing 707 - 320B would on average register 113 EPNdBv  &apos;attake-off and 116 EPNdB on landing, compared with 97 EPNdB and103 EPNdB respectively for a Tristar, an aircraft which is30 per cent heavier.     A reduction of 10 decibels ia equivalentto halving the apparent noisiness.     The trend towards thequieter aircraft which v/ill increase during the 1980s as theearlier jets are retired from service,  is already apparent at heathrow where over 20 per cent of aircraft movements are nowby aircraft meeting current noise certification standards.62     The Civil Aviation Authority will take aircraft noiseinto account when considering competing applications for a transport licence for services to and from London airports.The Government also takes this problem into account in carryingout all its duties in the civil aviation field.63     Because of the large number of overseas airlines whichofoperate in the United Kingdom and because so many of the aircr*used are of foreign manufacture, the full benefit from action i0reduce aircraft noise can be achieved only through the widest possible international agreement. The Government will, thercontinue its efforts within the International Civil Aviationv  &apos; PNdB-Perceived Noise Decibels is a scale of aircraftnoisiness as perceived by the human ear, it being more esensitive to some frequencies than others.     3PHdB-EffectiPerceived Noise Decibels is the PNdB scale with a weightifjtffor pure tones (single frequency tones) and for the lengthof time for v/hich the higher noise levels are experienced.The EPNdB scale is used in aircraft certification under therules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
Organisation (ICAO) to seek agreement or. the adoption ofProgressively more stringent noise standards in particular for new subsonic jet aircraft.     New, stricter noise standards&quot;ill be presented to Parliament for approval as soon asproposals formulated in ICAO have been agreed by the Councilof the Organisation, probably early in 1978.     These latestKAO standards will take advantage of the advance, that have been made in acoustic technology since the original standards*ere set in 1969.     As with the original standards, the revisedstandards will apply initially to new types of subsonic jet aircraft, hut discussions are now proceeding in ICAO with aview to agreeing a date from which all new production ofexisting subsonic jet aircraft should conform to the newstandards.     Developments in acoustical technology are alsooeing kept under review with the aim of setting even moreporous standards when these become practical and economicallyreasonable.Within the framework of the European Civil Avi,tionConference, the United Kingdom has been playing a leading?art in studies on the scope for restricting the use of non-noisecertificated suts0nic jet aircraft and -or encouraging theintroduction of new quieter aircraft.     As a result of these&quot;tudies, the Government proposes to prohibit the use of non-no.secortificatea 3ubsonic jet aircraft acquired by any UK operator
after the 3-J September 1978 and to prohibit from 1 January 19^2the use of all non-noise certificated subsonic jot aircraft onthe UK register.     These measures will ensure that a largeproportion of the aircraft using UK airports in the middle ana3ate 1960s will have markedly better noise character!sties th^many current aircraft.      Similar measures are expected to beintroduced by other States and the Government will continue to seek agreement within ECAC on further measures to promote thedevelopment and use of aircraft incorporating the latestadvances in noise abatement technology.65.    A number of developments suggest that the average numberof passengers per aircraft in the 1990s may be somewhat lower than was predicted in the consultation documents.     The patte--&apos;is likely to vary as between airports depending upon the tyPeof traffic.     For example, at regional airports it is likely that the introduction of wide bodied aircraft will be slower than in the London area because of the lower density of tr^-1and that the operation of older generation aircraft may be prolonged beyond the date by which they might be phased out ^the London airports end other major aviation centres. the forecasts in the consultation documents took account of thi0expected pattern of development and it remains true that thegeneral improvement which is envisaged in aircraft noise wi^be experienced throughout the country.
66    All forecasts involve a degree of uncertr.ir.ty, from whichthe :isses3nent of aircraft noise cannot he exempted. InParticular, the forecasts as they apply to particular airportsare dependent not only upon the assumptions discussed earlierbut also upon the routes followed by aircraft from a particularairport and the way in which airlines deploy their aircraft.Since the publication of the noise forecasts in the consultationagents a number of developments have   taken place which mightalter some of the assumptions on which those forecasts were based.     Some developments, such as the slower introduction ofnew aircraft will tend to reduce or delay the benefits envisagedaver the period to 1990.     But others will advance the expectedimprovements and international agreement on restricting the useof the older aircraft would accelerate the process still further,At Heathrow where the proportion of noise certificated aircrafth*a been rising steadily and is now over 20 per cent of the passenger traffic increased by nearly 13 per centtotal,between I973 and 1976, but air transport movements decreased by over ii** Per cent.     These developments give some expectation oftrend which will spread to other airports.     In general, the0vernment remains convinced that by 1990 the noise situationshow a significant improvement on the present position at^lla*rports.       The rate of improvement will vary betweensports and may be somewhat slov/er than envisaged previously,^ut thne most marked improvement should be at Heathrow.improvement in the noise situation around airports
will ta..e time to develop and it will &quot;be some time before anoticeable improvement in the present position can be distinguished.      In the meantime, the Government, airlineoperators and airport authorities will continue to implement a wide range of measures to mitigate the effects of aircraftnoise.      It is the Governments intention that these various measures should be maintained and that new policies should &quot;beintroduced where these can be shown to be cost effective andconsistent with safety.     The Government believes that airporcharges which take account of aircraft noise levels could provide a useful economic incentive for the development and us of quieter aircraft.     The Government has therefore soughtpowers to ensure that airport authorities, in their chargi^policies, are legally entitled to discriminate between noisyand quieter aircraft.     The United Kingdom is taking a leadi^part in discussions in ECAC and the Organisation for Econoifli0Cooperation and Development about the form in which noiserelated charges could most usefully be introduced at majorairports.     The Government has proposed that the charge shou^be related to the aircraft noise measured under noise certi^1cation conditions and that it should increase with the inte**of the noise.     With regard to existing policies, the Gover-confirms the continued use of runway alternation at Heath?and the general policy under which aircraft are required t0along minimum noise routes.      It accepts the arguments wh^have been put forward emphasising the importance of stabi-1and the need to avoid changes in these routes once they haVbeen agreed.
68    Aircraft movements at night present special problems;from the standpoint of the air transport industry, night operations have some important advantages, particularly inrelation to cargo, but for people living around airports,disturbance of sleep seems to be the most disruptive feature of aircraft operations.     It has been for some time theGovernment&apos;b policy to obtain a progressive reduction of aircraft noise at night, and at Heathrow and Gatwick,restrictions on movements by Jet aircraft at night have beengradually tightened.     However, the Government has decidedto develop a long term strategy for reducing night noisedisturbance by aircraft and in March 1977 it published aconsultation document setting out two possible ways in whichthis might be achieved at Heathrow and Gatwick. these alternatives were either to reduce progressively the number ofPermitted night flights until they were eliminated, when theairports would be closed at night, or gradually to phase out^ght flights by noisier aircraft so that the only movementswould be by quieter aircraft such as the^fristar, A300B and non-3et aircraft.     Having considered the responses to the consultation document, the Government decided to confirm thatall flights by noisier aircraft at night would be phased out*t Heathrow and Gatwick over a period of about 10 years. TheQovernment recognises that this policy at Heathrow and Gatwickoould lead to an increase of night movements by noisieralrcraft at Stansted and Luton.     It has therefore decided toPh*se out movements at night by these aircraft at Stansted.The Government expects the management of Luton Airport to takefuU account of the Government policy on reducing night noise
and to follow suit.69     Evidence is limited as to how much the quieter aircraftalso disturb sleep, although it suggests that these aircraft will disturb the sleep of far fewer people than other types 0aircraft.     As foreshadowed in the consultation document,it&quot;Night Disturbance from Aircraft Noise at Heathrow and GatwicKthe Government has decided to fund a programme of research into the relationship between aircraft noise and sleepdisturbance.     The results are expected to be available in1980.     Pending the results of this research, quieter jet aircraft such as the A300B, Tristar and non-jets will beallowed to operate at Heathrow and Gatwick within quota restrictions which will be set so as to ensure that there isno overall increase in aircraft movements at these airportsnight, and which will increase as the noisier quotas decreaseWhen the results of the research on noise disturbance at. t vare available the Government will decide whether to restncft *&apos;any way, or to phase out, movements by these quieter aircr&amp;any or all of the designated London airports.70 It will remain important to avoid creating new areas 0housing close to the major airports where aircraft noiseinevitably continue to be a serious problem.     Advice to ^0
Planning authorities in Great Britain on the control ofdevelopment in areas which are, or are expected to becomeaffected by aircraft noise is already contained in &quot;planning and Noise&quot; Department of Environment Circular 10/73, welsh office Circular 16/73 and Scottish Development DepartmentCircular 23/73.     The Government intends to reaffirm andclarify that advice, particularly with regard to proposals for housing development between the UO and 60 N.N.I. contours. Inthe case of existing developments the position can be relievedto some extent by the noise insulation of buildings. Grantsf** the insulation of dwellings are available at a number ofairports.     The noise insulation grants schemes for Heathrow*nd Gatwick closed at the end of 1977, and the government intends to consider what further measures are necessary.accessAirports are major traffic generators and questions of road and rail access figured prominently in the consultationsSome of those consulted argued against significant* an8ion8 at existing airports on the grounds that these could lead to00 congestion on the approach roads and also that thisgive rise to inconvenience and loss of amenity in the 8 affected.     These are important considerations and are
reflected in the strategy set out in the following Section.Generally, however, the country&apos;s airports are well served ^ythe existing and presently planned motorway and trunk roadnetwork and the further development of airports envisaged forthe 1980s should not call for disproportionate expenditure 011new works.      In particular, completion of the M25, which hasbeen accorded priority to provide an adequate route aroundLondon, will not only help industry and commerce and relieveresidential areas of heavy traffic, but will also serve, andlink, London1s two main airports at Heathrow and Gatwick.73 There were also representations that central Governmentfunds should be specifically available for road improvement3around those airports, particularly Heathrow and Gatwick, ^1Vhave a more than purely local function.     Under the policieSset out in the Transport Policy White Paper, the Governmentcontinue to give priority to improving those routes to the major ports and other industrial areas which carry a high proportion of industrial traffic.     Within these policiesGovernment recognises the need for adequate access to airP0which are important to the country&apos;s international trade balance of payments.     The Government will take this intoaccount in considering schemes for roads for which it is responsible.     As far as local transoort is concerned howe&quot;^1&quot;it must be for the local authorities to assess their pnoxin cases where, as a result of airport expansion, imorovefli611to local roads are thought desirable, and to make any appropriate
Provision in their Annual Transport Policies and Programmes,0n the assessment of which the distribution of TransportSu-):)iementary Grant to County Councils in England and Walesbased.7k    it ,as argued that improvements to public transport toairports eould ease possible problems with road aoeess particular-ly at the times when workers are travelling to and from theairports.     The Government agrees that it is desirable to makethe best use of publio transport.     Indeed, with the completionof the Piccadilly Line extension linking Heathrow direct to theLondon Transport underground system, and with the improvements^ the Gatwick rail services, these two airports will be wellserved by rail.     During the consultation process there weresuggestions for an additional rail link to Heathrow, for railservices for Stansted and Luton and rail links to other airportsdeluding Edinburgh and Prestwick.     The commercial feasibility of such possibilities must be initially for British Rail toconsider.     other suggestions for improved airport bus services,deluding services to main line railway stations are matters for the operators concerned together with the local authoritiesa*d their Transport Policies and Programmes.     There will be a continuing need for airport authorities and public transportAerators to work closely together to co-ordinate interchangefacilities, involving air, rail and bus services and theprovi8ion of travel information.
75     Finally, proposals were made for the use of long distancerail services to promote the diversion of traffic from theLondon airports to airports outside the South East. Binning^airport, with a recently constructed station on the main line from Euston serving the airport and the National ExhibitionCentre, was suggested for development in this context, and therewere also suggestions for a rail connection to East Midlandsairport from the St Pancras-Nottingham line.     A relatively 10ll*rail trip to an airport might he acceptable in cases where therail journey is in much the same direction as that of theonv/ard movement by air, and where the air passenger has aneasily accessible main line railway station.     But travel isexpensive and future supplies of energy and particularly oilare uncertain.     Transport systems which would involve consi^eI*able &quot;dead mileage&quot; as well as loss of time through theintroduction of additional inter-modal changes, do not makeAftsense.     Because the majority of air trips from this countryto the South, the Government does not believe, therefore, th^there is much scope for re-routeing genuine London areademands through airports that are located at substantialdistances to the north.     Aa far as the 1980s are concerned, *is unlikely that rail transport to airports will play a sig11^cant role except at Heathrow and Gatwick and, to a smallerextent, at Birmingham.PLANNING76 In the course of the consultations there were representtions particularly from within the South East, that airport
developments should not he allowed to cut across the provisionsof regional planning strategies and development plons. TheGovernment believes that, while major infrastructure items suchas airports can raise conflicts of interest between localregional and national requirements, ways have to be found of reconciling these different interests.     This has been one ofthe purposes of the consultations and of the resulting airportsstrategy.77    Many of the land-use planning consequences of large scaleairport expansion result from the employment opportunitiesprovided by an airport and in airport related activities andlocal services.     The prospects of additional employment havebeen welcomed at airports in the Assisted Areas.     Indeed, from most areas of the country, including the London area, there^s recognition of the benefits which increased, secure airportemployment could bring.     But the burden of many of the representations, particularly from the South East, was thatdemands for housing induced by major airport expansion wouldthreaten villages and valued areas of countryside, many of themjoying the protection afforded by Green Belt policies.?8Reflecting these considerations, the Government^ airportt^ategy naa as an important objective the growth of traffic atSelected regional airports and particularly at airports in theoea Areas.     However, the London area airports willttixiue through the 1980s to cater for the greater part of the
national demand for air travel.     During the consultationsconcern was expressed that the existing airports in the SouthEast would expand more or les3 indefinitely, exacerbateenvironmental problems and congestion, and cause serious difficulties for the local authorities responsible for planning and servicing the areas affected.     Uncertainties about the precise ways in which a large and complex facility such as an airport may be used and operated in the future can never be entirely eliminated.     However, the Government believes thatits strategy with its acceptance of limitations on the number and size of terminal to be built at particular airports, w illmeet the situation.79     As regards procedures for controlling the development ofairports, many local authorities and amenity groups in theSouth East expressed dissatisfaction at the extent of the developments which the BAA is permitted to carry out at itsairports under the Town and Country Planning general development Order 1977 and the Town and Country Planning(General Development) (Scotland) Order 1975*     The Governmentrecognises the efforts which the BAA makes to inform, consul^and respond to local interests.     Nevertheless, it accepts thelogic of the argument that the present provisions of theGeneral Development Order were framed before the advent of ^aaircraft and when runways were regarded as the main detenni^11of airport capacity whereas passenger and cargo terminals hav^now emerged as significant factors.     The Government, which
intends that control over the provision of major new terminalcapacity should he a feature of its airport strategy, is carrying out a general review of the statutory undertakers1Provisions in the General Development Order.      In the courseof this it will he discussing with the BAA and the localauthority associations modifications designed to bring under normal planning control the provision by the BAA of majorPassenger and cargo terminal buildings.      In the meantime, theSecretary of State for the Environment, has made a directionunder article h of the General Development Order making itnecessary for the BAA to seek specific planning permission forproposal to build a fourth terminal at Heathrow.SO    There was some criticism in the course of the consultations**out the situation at local authority owned airports where thelQoal planning authority could have a direct interest in anydeposed development.     The Government is satisfied, however,tfcat the statutory planning arrangements governing localauthorities&apos; own development proposals provide adequateaafeguards and are operating effectively.Thus all the main airport developments provided for in thetrategy will be subject to statutory planning procedures.Se allow for public inquiry in cases where this is justifiedand thne Secretary of State for the Environment has alreadyannunced his intention to hold such an inquiry into the BAAfs
proposed Heathrow fourth terminal.     The Government believes that airports, as important public transport facilities andsources of employment, should be treated as integral component5of regional strategies and of local authorities1 plans. Thejcannot be regarded as developments to be accommodated, ifpossible, only after other planning considerations have been met, nor can they be imposed on communities without regard forthe implications for the locality.     With this in mind theGovernment^ objective is to seek to improve the arrangementsfor consultation over the development of airports policy witnthe local planning authorities and the aviation interests.
SECTION hi      A NATIONAL AIRPOOTg SYSTEMINTRODUCTION82    Having established the framework for a national airportsstrategy in Section 1, it is necessary to relate this to individual airports, taking account of the demand described inSection 2 and the environmental considerations outlined inSection 3.83    one of the main lessons to be learnt from the RoskillCommission on the third London airport is the need for cautionin the planning of airports capacity.     While the growth of air transport has now resumed, following the recession of the last few years, the decisions which follow relate to the short and&quot;Wdium term up to the late 1980s.     It will be necessary togive further consideration to the longer term requirementsespecially for the London area, but also more widely inco-operation with local planning authorities.THE LONDON AREA AIRPORTSJ-nere are four main airports in the London area: HeathrowDy 1978, when existing redevelopment work is completed,ave a capacity of 30 million passengers a year; Gatwicknth   0capacity of 16 million passengers when rebuilding isaed in 1978;    Stansted capable of handling 1 million8er*gers and Luton with a capacity of 3 million passengers ayear. HHeathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are owned and operated
by the British Airports Authority, while Luton is owned bythe Luton Borough Council.     There are other airports in theLondon area, including Southend, but the Government does notconsider that any of these can make any major contribution tothe handling of air transport movements though, as is explained in paragraphs      -/%&quot;&quot;/ , some of them are expected to fulfil animportant role as short haul and general aviation airports.85     The existing main airports in the London area aregeographically conveniently grouped round the capital and well placed in relation to the existing and developing trunk road and motorway network.      Additionally, Gatwick is directly served by the British Rail line to Central London and, with thecompletion of the Piccadilly line extension is connected to the extensive London Transport underground system. movement between all Tour airports, and especially between Heathrow andGatwick, will be facilitated when the 1125, which is receivingtop priority, is completed.     iach of the airports is capableof expansion so that together they could meet the forecast air traffic demand in the 1980s.     Hence the London area airportsof Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton should be capable ofdevelopment, during the 1980s, as a single category A gatewayinternational airports system.     The capacity of about 50million passengers a year which will be available at theseairports from 1973 should be sufficient to cater for demandinto the early l.)80s, but this will require some redistribution of traffic among the airports and a clearer definition of theroles of the four airports.
86    The most immediate objective is to build up traffic atGatwick to use the extensive new facilities now nearing completion at that   airport.and to relieve the serious congestionwhich is expected at Heathrow from about 1981.     The Secretaryof State for Trade announced the Governments policy for thetransfer of services from Heathrow to Gatwick on 5 April 1977.This policy, which is crucial to the accommodation of air traffic in the London area at standards which air passengersshould expect, requires the full co-operation of the airlineoperators, for whom the facilities have been provided, and ofthe other aviation authorities concerned.     The need forflexibility has been emphasised earlier, but within this multiairport system the Government envisages that in general termsHeathrow and Gatwick will develop as the two major internationalairports for scheduled services, that the principal role forStansted will be for the handling of long range charter services which are most suited to the airport&apos;s facilities, and thatLuton will continue to handle short and medium range charterflights, but in future concentrating increasingly on passengersfrom the South East of England.      If Luton Borough Council andthe BAA were to agree to a transfer of ownership of Lutonairoort this would assist the BAA in exercising its majorexecutive and co-ordinating role in the development of theLondon airports system.Heathrow37    Heathrow is the largest international airport in the world
and it has &quot;been an important factor in the development ofBritish civil aviation since the Second World War.      It playsa major role in the country&apos;s trade and commerce and in inter-national tourism;    and it provides directly over 50,000 jobs.Against this background the consultation document put forward,as an option for the 1980s, a scheme aimed at realisingHeathrowfs full potential as a possible five terminal airport.This would involve the acquisition, by the BAA, of additional land between the runways at Perry Oaks at the western end ofthe airport and the replacement of the important sewage sludgedisposal facilities at present located on this land.88     The Government has considered carefully the representations which have been made both for and against this project, whichwould increase the capacity of the airport to over 50 millionpassengers a year.     Heathrow occupies a restricted site whichis markedly smaller than that of most other internationalairports though these handle significantly less traffic. TheGovernment does not consider that it would be feasible to handle satisfactorily such a volume of traffic at Heathrow orto provide, at a reasonable cost, adequate road, and possiblyrail, access.     Finally, and although even with such a develop-ment the level of noise disturbance could be expected toimprove consistently and significantly over the years, noisedisturbance at Heathrow will remain worse than at any otherairport in the United Kingdom.     The provision of a fifthterminal would reduce to some degree the improvement in noisedisturbance which those who live in the Heathrow area might
otherwise be entitled to expect and cast doubt on thecontinued practicability of the policy of runway alternation.&amp;9   In the light of these considerations, the Governmentconcluded that Heathrow1s ultimate development should not go beyond that of a four terminal airport;   a level of expansion which, as was explained when the government announced, in July 1974, the cancellation of the MaplinProject, was called for whether or not Maplin were built.The BAA currently proposes to build a fourth terminal onthe south side of Heathrow.     This proposal figures in theBAA*8 Master Plan for Heathrow, published in March 1976,a*id was the subject of a Background Note, upon which thelocal planning authorities were consulted in January 1977.As already stated, in paragraph 81, this proposal will bethe subject of a public inquiry.SS^wick90   With the completion of existing works next year,Gatwick will have a capacity of 16 million passengers ayear.     The airportfs single runway presents an effectiveC0*straint on the number of air transport movements andhe*ce on the extent to which Gatwick might be developed,
but as the consultation document explained, the capacityof the single runway should be sufficient to sustain the traffic from a second terminal which would raise the capacity of Gatwick to 25 million passengers a year.91   During the course of the consultations doubts were expressed about the practicability of handling this volumeof traffic with a single runway;    about the difficultieswhich would be involved if the runway had to be closed;and about the problem of runway maintenance.     There isat present no airport in the world which is handling athroughput of about 25 million passengers a year off asingle runway.      Indeed, there are very few airports withthis amount of traffic.     However, the British airports authority is convinced that there are no overridingreasons v/hy such levels of traffic should not be accommodatedwith a single runway.     The runway capacity at Gatwickwill be 160 thousand air transport movements per yearand with the increasing numbers of passengers per aircraftexpected in the London area in the period up to 1990 thereis no reason to suppose that the longer term utilisation
of two terminals at Gatwick would be inhibited by runwayconstraints.     There would remain the pessibility thatthe runway might be obstructed, with the result that the airport would have to be closed.     Experience suggeststhat the probability of this happening is very low, andfor this reason, and recognising that other runways areavailable in the London area, the Government does notconsider that expenditure of  10-20 million on theProvision of a second runway, which would be required ononly rare occasions, would be justified.     As far asmaintenance is concerned, the British Airports Authority hasalready carried out major repairs and resurfacing of the runway at Gatwick without any interruption to services andthere i0 no reason to suppose that this cannot continue.92   Gatwick is within an area which was identified as a majorgrowth area in the Strategic Plan for the South East, though**ring the consultations there were representations that there could be difficulties in coping with the increased employment*nd the growth of road traffic which could arise if the BAA wentafcead with a second terminal in the 1980s.     The rail*lix* atG*twick, which provides a frequent train service to and fromVictoria already offers a convenient means of transport fora large proportion of air passengers.     The Government
believes that the opportunity which this affords for an integrated rail/air system should be actively pursued byBritish  ail, BAA and the airlines concerned.93     As was explained in Part 1 of the consultation document,while the number of people troubled by aircraft noise at Gatwickis only a fraction of those affected at Heathrow, noisedisturbance at Gatwick is expected to increase over the next fewyears as traffic rises at the airport to utilise the new capacity which will become available in 1978.     By the time thesecond terminal would be required, 3ome time in the mid 1980s,it is forecast that the noise situation around Gatwick would be improved and the additional capacity envisaged would be unlikely to reverse this continuing improvement.     Government policy for reducing disturbance at night v/ill ensure that the growth oftraffic at Gatwick will not be accompanied by a growth of nightdisturbance.94     In the light of these considerations the Government seesno objection to the BAA bringing forward for examination throughthe appropriate planning procedures proposals for the developingof Gatwick during the 1980s as a two terminal airport with an ultimate capacity of around 25 million passengers a year.
Stansted95    For various reasons, including the collapse of residentairlines, the existing terminal facilities at Stansted, whichhave sufficient capacity to handle 1 million passengers a year,have been very much under utilised in recent years. Overtime this surplus capacity will be brought into use.     Part 1of the consultation document considered two possible levels offurther development for the 1960s:   to k million passengers a^ar, which would involve an extension of the existing terminaland associated facilities, and to 16 million passengers a year,&quot;hlch would reproduce at Stansted the level of development now^ing provided at Gatwick.     Both these developments would be contained within the existing boundaries of the airport and*ould not involve any further runway development.96During the consultations there was a good deal of local^Position to, but also some support for, the development of st;Pi:$tan^ttea-     The opposition concentrated on three issues.rst* that earlier inquiries had concluded that Stansted shouldt be developed;    secondly, that additional noise disturbanceWouin ^De unacceptable in an attractive rural environment; andirdly, that expansion would conflict with the strategic planf 0 Jl    a. ine South East of England and the general planning objectives of thne local authorities.     The earlier inquiries and the RoskillMission were concerned with the provision of a massive newa iPOl*t at Stansted, involving the acquisition of additional land fnxor the accommodation of four runways and capacity for up
to 50 million passengers a year.     What was considered in the consultation document was a much more modest development whichbore little resemblance to the project with which the RoskillCommission was concerned.     The support for some expansion ofthe airport emphasised two points:    the need to use more effectively the resources available at, and the potential of,the airport;    and the maintenance of existing employment andthe additional jobs which would be provided.97     In relation to aircraft noise disturbance, Stansted is perhaps one of the most satisfactory existing airports inGreat Britain at which to accommodate the expansion of air traffic.     The consultation document demonstrated that fewerpeople would be affected at Stansted in 1990 with a throughputof 16 million passengers than at almost any other airport inGreat Britain.      It indicated that around 2,000 people wouldbe affected by noise at Stansted in 1990 with a throughput of16 million passengers a year compared with over 200,000 at heathrow with 38 million passengers.     Hertfordshire CountyCouncil, in their submission on the consultation document,provided alternative estimates of noise disturbance at Stanstedtaking into account test and training flights and includingless optimistic assumptions concerning the rate of introductionof quieter aircraft.     As air transport movements increase testand training flights can be expected to decline, but in anycase these alternative estimates do not alter the basic conduSthat, in terms of aircraft noise disturbance, Stansted has
8lgnifiCant advantages over other airports98    The Government is conscious that the development of an airport in a primarily rural area could be intrusive and,because of the existing low ambient noise level, cause somewhatgreater noise disturbance than might be the case in some other^eas.     However, as a guide to public policy, the government does not accept that because populations surrounding existingairports may have become accustomed, to some extent, to highWl8 of n0i8e, they should be expected to tolerate the^Position of yet further noise disturbance.     The Government^aiders that the principal criterion should be the numbers0f People expected to be affected by particular airportdevelopments.99Stansted is well situated, access by the M11 to outerondon i8 good and the aircraft noise situation is superior tonat at any other airport in the London area.     Moreover, the^Port has a good runway and adequate facilities, all of whichapegrossly under utilised.     The Government sees no objection**ke BAA bringing forward proposals to develop the airport toCcommodate I4 million passengers a year so that these may beamined through the appropriate planning procedures.     On theQther hnand development of Staasted to a capacity of 16 million
passengers a year would raise wider issues, including major changes in the planning policies for the area.   Therefore, asis explained later in this document, a major expansion ofStansted would &quot;be only one of the options to &quot;be examined to meetlonger term demand in the London area.Luton100 Luton airport is currently handling about 2 millionpassengers a year; although before the recession in air travelthe throughput of the airport was in excess of 3 millionpassengers.     With modification and additions to the existingterminal, Luton airport could handle 5 million passengers ayear.     This growth in traffic was considered in the consultationdocument, along with a more fundamental redevelopment of the airport to increase the capacity to 10 million passengers a yearby the provision of a new terminal.101 There was support, notably from the Bedfordshire localauthorities, for an expansion of the airport&apos;s capacity toaround 5 million passengers a year.     This was influenced bythe benefits which were seen to flow from possible increases in airport and service employment in an area that is heavily dependent on industries associated with vehicle manufacture.However, there was also considerable opposition, particularly from Hertfordshire, to any increased use of the airport mainly on the grounds that this would give rise to noise problems and
to demands for new housing.102    Because of its pre-eminent role in handling charterflights, Luton airport has had a greater proportion of nightflights, compared with daytime flights, than other airportsin the London area.     The Government has announced its intentionsteadily to reduce night time disturbance at Heathrow andGatwick.     It would expect the same situation to obtain atLuton.     Generally, as in the case of Stansted, aircraft noiseat Luton affects fewer people than at other airports in theLondon area and the regions.     A throughput of 5 millionpassengers a year, which would build up over a period, shouldnot affect the forecast of an overall improvement in the noisesituation, which by 1990, should be significantly better thanat present.103    The Government does not consider that Luton airport issuitable for major development.     However, Luton is an integral part of the London airports system within which it fulfils animportant role.     The Government has concluded therefore thatLuton airport should be restricted to a capacity of 5 millionpassengers a year.     As pointed out in paragraph 86, thetransfer of ownership of the airport to the BAA would be consistent with its role in the London airports system.
Adequacy of proposed developments10U     The developments outlined above would provide terminalcapacity to handle approximately 72 million passengers a year.Even at the highest passenger forecast, these terminal develop-ments should be sufficient to accommodate demand up to and beyond the middle of the 1980s and quite possibly it couldprove adequate up to 1990,105     The ability of each airport to utilise its terminalfacilities is affected by its runway capacity to cater forthe anticipated number of air transport movements. Animportant element in assessimg the level of aircraft movementsis an estimate of the average number of passengers per aircraft which depends on various factors, including the rate of growth of traffic, the fleet replacement plans of airlines and the type of traffic handled.     The most recent indications are thatthCt progressive introduction of the larger aircraft will beslower than previously anticipated which, with the higher proportion of short haul traffic which is now forecast, will reduce the average number of passengers per aircraft expectedat the London area group of airports to between 150 and 165in 1990.     The latest estimates of runway capacity at the fourLondon airports are:    275,000 air transport movements at Heathr0160,000 at Gatwick and ^.20,000 at Luton and Stansted combined.The capacities for Heathrow and Gatwick represent a reduction 111the earlier estimates due mainly to new standards of separationbetween aircraft arriving and departing.     However, even
assuming that the average number of passengers per aircraft istowards the bottom of this range at each airport, runwaycapacity should be sufficient to accommodate the maximum levels of development envisaged in the strategy for the 1980s.106    The CAA has given further consideration to the ability of the air traffic control system to accommodate air trafficdemand, not only in relation to runways, but also in respect ofthe route system within the airspace surrounding the majorairports and the radiating air routes.     This has revealed no major problems in handling any of the likely airport capacitycombinations that might be considered in the period to 1990.The longer term107    If air traffic continues to grow, in the longer termadditional capacity will be required.     No further development at Heathrow beyond a fourth terminal, at Gatwick beyond asecond terminal, and at Luton beyond a single terminal, is envisaged.     For the longer term therefore the possibilitiesare a major expansion at Stansted;    the development of an existing military airfield as a civil airport for the london area;   or the construction of a new airport.     The Governmentwill, therefore, seek advice on the longer term provision ofairports capacity, taking into account the need to involve thelocal authorities more closely in the identification of available options.
Costs108     The former Maplin strategy was based on the completionof a fourth terminal at Heathrow and the opening of the firstphase of the Maplin development in the early 1980s, Thiswould have made a second terminal at Gatwick unnecessary andwould have made possible the closure of Stansted and Lutonto air transport movements.     The present strategy will rely on a second Gatwick terminal together with Stansted and Lutonto provide capacity for some 18 million passengers a year,equivalent to the capacity which would have been provided by building one of Maplin*s runways and two of its proposedterminals.109     The capital cost, exclusive of interest charges, involvedin providing a runway and two terminals at Maplin would havebeen  680 million based on estimates given in the Maplin Reviewupdated to end-1976 prices.     This would cover the relocationof the Defence Establishments and land reclamation as well asthe costs of new airport facilities.     On the same basis, usingupdated costs given in the consultation document, the presentstrategy costs for Gatwick, Stansted and Luton would be about 150 million.110     Additionally, Maplin on a remote and inaccessible sitesome 50 miles from London would have had little chance ofsuccess unless it were provided at the outset with a motorway
link at least to the M25 and with a high-speed railway.These, with local road and rail connections, would have cost about  1*10 million at end-1976 prices.     The costs of any road and rail improvement schemes that might be called for inconnection with increased use of Gatwick, Stansted and Lutonv&apos;ould not be significant in comparison with the costs of access to Maplin.AIRPORTS OUTSIDE THE SOUTH EASTHi    whereas the requirement in the London area is for additional terminal capacity to accommodate the demand, outside*e South East of England and in Scotland and Wales the problemi* to achieve a more effective use of the existing facilities.faring in mind the relative demands in the catchment areas,tfce Government considers that there is no scope for more thangateway international airports (Category A), at Manchester*** Glasgow/Prestwick, outside the South East during the period to i990^SSliij^Sn land112After the South East, Central England, which is taken toae the Merseyside, Manchester, Yorkshire and Birmingham^Urbations, represents the largest catchment area for airc J-n Great Britain.     The Government considers that inthe loonjvvs the area should be able to sustain one international
gateway airport and that it should be at Manchester,113     At the present time Manchester airport, which is a majorbase for British Airways and used by many international airlineS&apos;is handling about 2j million passengers a year.     By 1990, andwith the implementation of the policies envisaged in paragraphs22 and 2U, it is forecast that throughput might increase toaround 6 million passengers.     The existing terminal facilities at Manchester and a single runway should be adequate to accommodate this level of traffic.     The state of the presentrunway at Manchester is giving some cause for concern and consideration is being given to whether, and if so how, itbe strengthened and improved.     It is possible also that alimited extension of the runway may be required to enable the airport to fulfil completely its role as a category A airport&apos;11U   &apos;During the consultation process, particular attention was drawn to the future of Liverpool airport.      It was suggeSthat air traffic in the North West of England might be distributed between Manchester and Liverpool airports; that two airports might be owned and operated together by a consortium of the relevant local authorities;    that Liverp00^airport might be redeveloped with a new passenger terminal,control tower and related facilities alongside the new runtf0^when the &quot;old&quot; airport could be disposed of for non-aeronautJ
Purposes; or that Liverpool airport might be placed on a careQnd maintenance basis.115     The basis of the Government&apos;s airports policy is thatnationalisation of the facilities outside the South East ofEngland, and concentration of air services at a limited numberof airports, are 3ikely to be among the most effective waysQf seeking to redress the balance in air transport between theSouth East and the rest of Great Britain,     The Government doesnot consider that the allocation of traffic between manchester and Liverpool and common ownership of the two airports islikely to assist this objective.     In the Governments view itis more likely to result in lower frequencies and a more limitedrange of services for the North West while not guaranteeing a&quot;viable future for Liverpool.U6     The Government believes that Liverpool airport shouldfulfil a loeal role as a category C airport providing somescheduled feeder services, notably to Ireland and the Isle offen and perhaps to London and other major centres in England,Scotland and Wales;   some charter services to the more popular^stinstions;   and facilities for business and general aviationfT Meraeyslde.     In such a role the Government does notVisage that Liverpool airport would be handling more than milUon passengers a year by 1990.    The immediate future of
Liverpool airport must be a matter for the local authorities concerned.     Redevelopment, as envisaged in paragraph 114,might have some attraction, but this would have to be consider^on its commercial merits and not on the assumption of Governingfinancial support.117     There are two main airports in the Midlands: Binning^and East Midlands.     Birmingham airport, which handles over1 million passengers a year, is long established, is well sitclin relation to the national motorway and rail systems and theNational Exhibition Centre and is a base for British Airways-Industry and commerce in the West Midlands has an important nefor air communications and with the large population of thearea there is likely to be a growing demand for a wider rangscheduled and charter services.     On the other hand, the. toairDort occupies a restricted site, and with built up area^the north and, west has difficult aircraft noise and environ111problems which have been the subject of extensive represent8Moreover, at times,  the existing terminal is seriously con eSand improved terminal and related facilities, which could recostly, would be required to accommodate the forecast growthtraffic in the 1980s.     The local authority ov/ners arepresently considering proposals to increase the capacity 0^the airport.118     East Midlands airport, although somewhat further fro01
the main concentration of population in the Midlands, is alsowell sited in relation to the motorway network and has animportant industrial and commercial catchment area. Fewerpeopleare affected by aircraft noise than at Birmingham andthe airport1s modern construction lends itself more readilyto expansion than Birmingham airport.     However, East Midlands^oes not have at present the nucleus of domestic and shorth*ul international services which are provided already fromBirmingham, and a build up of traffic from the present level0- nearly 600,000 passengers a year might be somewhat slower than at Birmingham.u10 Tjuearmg in mind the limited scope for diverting &quot;traffic*0ln ^ke London area, the Government does not consider that the&quot;inlands could sustain a category A airport in the period up to1990.However,  the Government has concluded that there iskely tely to be sufficient demand for air services in the MidlandsJustify both Birmingham and east Midlands airports fulfilling^e roles of category B airports in the period up to 1990.fte light of the existing division of traffic, and subject toProvision of additional terminal capacity, Birmingham, with greater proportion of scheduled services, might be handlingbetween o* and 3 million passengers a year by 1990.

120     In the longer term, if air traffic continues to grow, and develop more strongly in the regions outside the South East,either East Midlands or Birmingham could be expected to developinto a Category A airport.     In view of the restricted site andenvircnmental problems at Birmingham, East Midlands might havethe greater potential to assume that role.      It will be important to see how the two airports develop into the 1980s.121     Finally,  in the Central England area, considerationmust be given to Yorkshire and ilumberside and specifically to the position of Leeds/Bradford airport.     The limited lengthof the runway at Leeds/Bradford places a serious constraint onthe aircraft which can use the airport anci the services that can be operated.     For long haul services Yorkshire andHumberside will continue to be served by Manchester and theLondon airports.     The feeder service to London is at riskbecause of runway limitations which also affect the provisionof short haul scheduled and charter services which are forcedtherefore to use other airports.     Some of this traffic mayuse Manchester, or East Midlands, or the airports in the NorthEast, but an important part of it goes through the Londonairports.     The Government does not consider that the demand 1$such as to Justify the massive expense which would be involvedin the provision of a new airport in Yorkshire find Humberside*However, it considers that Yorkshire could sustain a categ01&apos;vregional airport.     The Government does not envisage an
extensive role for such an airport within a national strategy,but for Leeds/Bradford airport to meet this requirement wouldinvolve an extension of the existing runway. Considerationof this would be in the first instance a matter for the localauthorities.122    At the Central England eiroorts the main problems of aircraft noise disturbance are at Manchester and Sirmihghamwhere at present levels of traffic more people are affectedhy noise than at any other airport in Great Britain with theexception of Heathrow, Gatwick and Glasgow.     At both manchester and Birmingham airports, and at traffic levels which now seemrealistic, a significant improvement in the noise situation is forecast between now and 1990.     The concentration of air services at a limited number of airports outside the South Eastshould assist this process to the extent that it encourages the&quot;institution of new, larger quieter aircraft for the smaller,Qlaer and noisier aircraft which might otherwise be used.Nevertheless, the Government recognises that aircraft noise isintrusive wherever it is;    that some regional airports alreadyexoerience far more noise disturbance than some airports in theLondon area;    and that there is no justification for relievingtne South East airports, particularly Gatwick, Stansted andLuton, by imposing an increased noise burden on, for example,Manchester and Birmingham airports.     The introduction of newluieter aircraft and the action being taken to impose stricternoiae certification requirements will benefit regional airports
as welJ as those in the London area, although the rate ofimprovement may be somewhat slower.123     Apart from Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, EastMidlands and Leeds/Bradford airports which have been consideredalready there are a number of other airports in Central EnglanC*such as Blackpool, Coventry, Humberside and Norwich. TheGovernment does not envisage a major role for any of theseairports within the national airports system.     Norwich, and perhaps Blackpool, can be expected to fulfil a category C roleand Humberside may also develop as a third level airport.main purpose of Coventry is likely to be as a category D,general aviation aerodrome.Northern England12U     There are three airports in Northern England, atNewcastle, Tees-side and Carlisle.     The North East of Englan(ipresents particular problems where Newcastle and Tees-sideairports are only about i+0 miles apart.     However, unlike thesituation in the North West, v/here Manchester is a very much larger airport than Liverpool, there is not the same disparityin size between the two North Eastern airports.     Neither is there the same potential demand.     By 1990 it is forecast thatthere will be about 2 million passengers using the two airpor^
Newcastle is long established, handles about three times asmuch traffic as Tees-side, has rather more extensive facilities and la USed by British Airways.     On the other hand the future growth of Tees-side might generate a substantially increased demand for air services.     By 1990 neither airport should havea serious noise disturbance problem.125    The Government does not agree, as has been suggested,that eteps should be taken to limit the expansion of Newcastleairport to enable Tees-side to catch up.     It believes thatthe North East generally would benefit from some concentration^ services at one or other of the two airports, since this&quot;ould provide both better frequencies and a wider range of services than might otherwise be possible;    and it recognises that each airport could sustain some domestic services,particularly a London service, and perhaps some short haul^rvices to Europe.     The Government considers that in practice^castle has certain advantages over Tees-side, notably as a^ase for British Airways, and it remains unconvinced that thegrowth of industry itself will generate sufficient demand to0vercome the existing advantage of Newcastle.l26 m,J-ne Government does not envisage circumstances in whicha cateSory A international gateway airport could be required in north East of England, or at this stage that a major
extension to the runways at either of the airports could hejustified.      The Government believes that the North East will benefit from a concentration of air services at Newcastle.However, given the facilities which are available at thatairport and at Tees-side, and the importance of maintaininggood connections from Tees-side for its industrial hinterland,the Government considers that there are valid reasons to supportthe continuing operation of both airports.      It has concluded,therefore, that Newcastle should develop as a category Bregional airport and that Tees-side should be a category Cairport, with adequate domestic services and, where demand is sufficient, some short haul international services. TheGovernment is aware that discussions are proceeding between theNewcastle Airport Authority and the BAA with a view to the BAAtaking over the airport.     Recognising the significance of air transport development in the North East, the Government takes the view that this action by the two authorities is consistent with the guidelines in this White Paper.127     The predominant role of Carlisle airport is as acategory D general aviation and training aerodrome. Givenits excellent weather record and its remoteness from centres of population it will be the Governments intention to encoura ea   greater use of Carlisle airport for training.     This couldrelieve pressure on airports particularly in the South East ofEngland where such activities are a considerable burden both onairport capacity and on the surrounding communities.
South Vales and South /Jest England128    There are five signifleant airports in South Wales andSouth West England;   Glamorgan, Bristol, and Exeter which canbe considered as a group and Bournemouth and Southampton!1)&quot;hich may also be taken together.     The airports at Bournemouthand Southampton are sufficiently close to the South East tohave the prospect, identified in the consultation document, of attracting traffic from the London area.     Bristol andGlamorgan airports might also in theory take traffic divertedforn the London area.     However, in the light of the considera-tion given to regional diversion in Section 1, the government considers that it would be wrong to assess the roles of airportsto South Wales and South West England on the basis of a majortransfer of traffic from the South East.     Taking this intoaccount, it is unlikely that traffic over this wide area willan,ount to more than 3 million passengers in all by 1990. In^ese circumstances there is a danger that the available traffic^Id be spread very thinly among the airports and thus, as wastinted out by the Civil Aviation Authority in their study ofairports in the region, lead to a poorer service particularly011 scheduled flights than might be the case if traffic were concentrated at fewer airports.At present, Glamorgan and Bristol airports handle a^thampton Airport is within the South East Economic PlanningBon   n&apos; Dut it covers broadly the same catchment area asai^^^^th Airoort and it is convenient to consider the twolrPorts together.
similar volume and type of traffic,  concentrating mainly oncharter services, scheduled domestic flights and a fewinternational scheduled services.      It is likely that SouthWales, the Bristol conurbation and South West England generally^could sustain one, but not two, category B regional airports.Neither of the two airports is ideally suited to accommodate the demand in both South Wales and South West of England.There is however a significant difference in the facilities available at the two airports.     Although few people are affected by aircraft noise at either airport, the consultation8showed some opposition to expansion at Bristol.      On the otherhand, none of the many representations received suggested thatGlamorgan airport was environmentally unacceptable. Further^more, expansion of traffic at Glamorgan would support theGovernments regional development policies since the airport isin a Development area, close to a Special Development Area.130     At Bristol, the present terminal is no more than adeq.uatfor the existing levels of traffic and its development as acategory B airport would require considerable expenditure on new terminal facilities and some extension of the runway mi ntalso be necessary as well as improvements to the navigationalfacilities.     In contrast, at Glamorgan the modern terminal lSmore than adequate, as are the runway and other facilities, *0meet all foreseeable demands up to 1990.     In the light of the considerations, including the expenditure which would be
involved in the further development of Bristol airport andwhich, among other reasons, would rule out a new airport forSevernside or the adaptation of Pilton as a civil airport, theGovernment has concluded that Glamorgan should hfve the roleQf a category B airport.     Bristol airport may continue to fulfil a local role as a category C airport, but this is amatter which the local authorities will wish to consider.131     During the course of the consultations it was suggestedthat a combination of Glamorgan and Exeter airports would meetmost satisfactorily the requirements of South Wales and SouthWest England.     Whether there should be any close and permanentassociation between Glamorgan and Exeter airports will be forthe local authorities to consider, but given the relativeremoteness of Cornwall and Devon, Exeter airport seems likelyto retain its usefulness and to expand its role as a local,category C, airport.132     Both Southampton and Bournemouth airports fulfil asimilar role, and scheduled services to the Channel Islands,to meet a demand from a much wider area than that surroundingthe two airports, are of importance.     Southampton has a significant advantage over Bournemouth in terms of its location,it also has a larger catchment area and a more extensive*ange of services.     On the other hand, Southampton airport is
privately owned and from time to time there have been doubts about its future.     Furthermore, it occupies a restricted sitewhich affords little scope for expansion to enable the airportto embrace a wider role.     There is room for further develop-ment at Bournemouth airport, but there is considerable localopposition to its expansion.     The Government doe3 not envisageany major change in the roles of Bournemouth and Southamptonairports or any requirement for significant additional develop-ment at either airport.     The principal role for any airport inthis area is to provide a link with the Channel Islands. TheGovernment considers that in this connection Southampton hascertain advantages over Bournemouth, that it should receivepreference in the licensing of services to the Channel Islands,that the airport management should be encouraged to maintain and develop the role of Southampton as a category C airport,and that Bournemouth1s function will be largely as a category Dairport.133     During the course of the consultations a good deal of concern was expressed about aircraft noise at Bristol,Bournemouth and Southampton airports, and in relation to thevolume of traffic there are a significant number of peopleaffected by noise at Southampton.     However, given the limitedroles which are now envisaged for Bournemouth and Bristolairports, and the physical constraints on Southampton airport^the Government does not consider that aircraft noise disturban^should be a major problem at airports in South Wales and SouthWest England.
Finally, under the Governments devolution proposals,the Welsh Assembly would have responsibility for planning and environmental matters associated with any future airportdevelopment in Wales.^tlandAs the consultation document recognised, Scotland formsRelatively distinct unit in airport planning terms. The8cope for diverting London traffic to Scotland apart fromtfaff j.c with Scottish origins or destinations at presentlnterlin:ng(1) through London, is negligible, and, with thePlaited exception of the extent to which people in the BordersmiSht look towards the North of England, there is no overlap^&quot;i with the catchment areas of airports in England and 7/ales.Hi8toricallyj air travel has been more developed on domestic0utes in Scotland than in the English regions.     The distancesSolved and the relative attractiveness of air travel toQn, compared with road and rai^., have contributed greatlythe growth of Glasgow and Edinburgh airports to become theCond and fourth largest outside the London area in 1976, and0uSh the importance of the London route could diminish, this8hould -u^oe more than offset by the development of direct routes0ther destinations.     In recent years, Aberdeen, Sumburghana   vi r*vAricwali airports have all experienced above average growth^ interline passenger is one who changes planes at anrPort and has no other reason for visiting the airport.
in passenger and aircraft movements as a result of the stimulus of oil related activities, and Aberdeen has been thefastest growing airport in the United Kingdom.     Finally, theScottish Highlands and Islands aerodromes, while not sosignificant in terms of the number of passengers handled, havean important social function in the isolated communities whichthey serve.136     There is no shortage of runway or terminal capacity inScotland and all the major airports have extensive modernfacilities, or are being provided with them by the BAA whichowns Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Prestwick airports.The situation in Central Scotland is complex and there isprobably a greater excess of airport capacity in this regionthan anywhere else in Great Britain.     It is probable thateconomies in operation for both airline and airport managementswith consequent benefits to passengers, would result from abetter match between capacity and demand.     Under the Govern-mentf8 devolution proposals responsibility for airports inScotland is to be transferred to the Scottish Assembly, subjectto agreement on the arrangements for airports operated by theBAA and CAA and to the reservation of functions related to the regulation and safety of civil aviation generally. Ultimatelytherefore, longer term policies for airports in Scotland willbe a matter for the devolved administration, but the government believes that it may be helpful in this context to set down atthis time its views on airport development in Scotland.
Central Scotland137    Prom time to time it has been suggested that the rationalisation of the Central Scotland airport system shouldhe achieved by constructing a completely new airport betweenEdinburgh and Glasgow.     Very little support for a new airportwas expressed during the consultations, and in the governments view such a project, which would be extremely expensive, would represent an unjustifiable waste of existing assets. the potential role of the airstrip at Dundee was also examined, but^  view of the improved road communications between Tayside and existing airports, there is no case for expansion of theairstrip beyond the purely local role of a category D generalaviation airport.     The Government has no doubt, therefore, thatthe airport needs of Central Scotland should be met for the foreseeable future by the existing facilities at Edinburgh,^asgow and Prest-wick.      -within existing policies, PrestwickIndies the transatlantic traffic   for the whole of Scotland;Glasgow caters for domestic and European services for the West ofScotland;    and Edinburgh provides domestic and some European8ervices for the East Coast.     However, during the consultationsthere was some pressure for this division of traffic to beahandoned op modified, and specifically for some Prestwick traffic to betransferred to Glasgow and for Edinburgh, with its modern,; facilities, to be allowed to develop more freely and tooater* f- a or b wider range of services.     With regard to the latter,thepG -jis no doubt that in the past traffic at Edinburgh was pressed as a result of the badly aligned runway and the lack of
adequate terminal facilities;    traffic increased by 20 per centin the first year of operations with the new runway. Moreover!the increasing importance of Edinburgh as the capital of Scotlandand the industrial development on the eastern side of Scotlandboth suggest that the relative importance of Edinburgh is likelyto increase.138     The respective roles of Prestwick and Glasgow are closely related both to each other and also to Edinburgh.Although an extension of the runway at Glasgow and some otherdevelopment would be necessary before the airport could handleall long haul traffic, either Glasgow or Pre3twick is capable 0?handling the joint demand anticipated up to 1990. Savingaforthe airlines and the BAA, and perhaps a better service forScotland, could be achieved by concentrating services at one ofother airport.     In this connection, Glasgov/ airport is betterplaced for the main centres of population, has already an extensive route network and handles nearly six times as manypassengers as Prestwick.     On the other hand, Prestwick wouldnot require any extension of its runway, it has a superiorweather record to Gta.sgow and aircraft noise presents less of a problem.     At the present time Prestwick fulfils an importantrole as a diversion airport and as a base for test and trainingactivities.     However, if the bulk of its passenger and cargoservices were transferred to Glasgow it is difficult to envisa ea viable role for Prestwick and the expectation must be that ^eairport would close.
139   The concentration of services at Glasgow or Prestwicic&quot;nfl the ending of restrictions on the use by certain servicesof Edinburgh airport could in the long run   increase air services and produce an overall benefit for Scotland as a whole.However, the closure of Glasgow airport or, perhaps more probably, Prestwick airport could involve wider considerations.The Government takes the view that this is an issue which theProposed Scottish Assembly would wish to examine.     In viewof this, and the need to study the effects of the new facilities^ Edinburgh over an extended period, the Government has concluded^at existing policies relating to the allocation of traffic^ong the three lowland airports should be maintained generally,b*t that some greater flexibility could be followed in thedevelopment of traffic at Edinburgh.North.The discovery and exploitation of oil in the North Sea&apos;ern scotland*40ransformed a number of the aerodromes in the Northern partootland, in Orkney and in Shetland, and especially AberdeenaridSumburgh both of which have experienced very fast rates of growth iin recent years.     Considerable development by both the^Aaand the BAA, supported by the Government, has been necessary at aumber of these aerodromes, and further investment will be^nired at some of them.     Until 1975, Aberdeen was operated^aa but with a considerable growth of the airport, as of oil-related activities, responsibility for it wasnaferred to the BAA, with its wider experience of airport
management and of operating large and expanding airports.A similar situation to that which led to a change inownership at Aberdeen is now developing at Sumburgh and,to a lesser extent at Inverness and Kirkwall.141     The consultation document said that the possibilityof transferring responsibility for the 8 Highlands and islands aerodromes from the CAA to the BAA was being examined.     As these aerodromes are of major importance t0the communities they serve and in a number of instancesvital to the development of the oil industry, the Govern-ment wished to assess the need, particularly at thoseaerodromes used by the oil industry, for wider airportmanagement experience and resources to handle the rapidly growing traffic;    to plan and supervise the extensiveadditional investment required;    and to exploit any revenuCearning potential.    The Government believed it was importalso to establish the advantages in terms of the Governinerltdevolution proposals to be derived from associating the highlands and Islands aerodromes with the four major ai**Porin Scotland as part of the largely autonomous ScottishAirports Division of the BAA.
1U2   With some significant exceptions, Scottish opiniongenerally was opposed to any change in ownership of the highlands and Islands aerodromes;    partly because itwas thought that the BAA would be insufficiently sensitiveto local opinion, but primarily because it was consideredthat the change could lead to an increase in the cost ofair travel in the area.     The evidence available to theGovernment does not suggest that either of these fears is justified.     However, given the proposals in the ScotlandBill for the devolution of responsibility for aerodromes,it considers that it is preferable to leave the futureownership and management of the aerodromes for decisionoy the devolved administration.      The Government hasconcluded therefore that, for the present, the highlands and Islands aerodromes ^with one exception/ should remain the responsibility of the CAA.^3 ^In the case of Sumburgh whicAis now in a similarPosition to that reached earlier at Aberdee^ the
Government has concluded that the management problems involved in the handling of the sharp growth of oil industry traffic, in controlling investment at the aerodrome, and in developing the aerodrome^ facilities are such that a decision should not be further delayed.Accordingly,  it has been decided that Sumburgh shouldbe taken over by the BAA without delay^j/ Expensivefacilities have been provided for the oil industry,particularly at Sumburgh, and the Government considersthat its traffic should pay a larger and fairer shareof the cost of these facilities.       The CAA /and theBA^ will therefore be requested to develop chargingpolicies at the Highlands and Islands aerodromea whichreflect this aim.GENERAL AVIATION1UU.     The consultation document   Airport Strategy for UABritain&quot; was concerned essentially with airport facilitierequired to meet the demand for air transport movements-This is only part of civil aviation and the Governmentrecognises that general aviation, and within that busineSaviation, is an important user and in some cases the maJuser, of airport facilitie8.
1U5     In us consideration of general aviation facilities the Government has been influenced by two main factors: thatthe accommodation of general aviation presents no problem interms of the availability of aerodromes outside the South east of England and that its principal concern should be forhusiness aviation which, in the facilities it requires has aelose affinity to airline operations.     Facilities for private and recreational flying are available throughout the countryand, recognising always the need to take full account of the&apos;ieW3 of local communities, their use and development shouldcontinue to bo primarily the concern of the local planning authorities.!h6 a*   as in the case of commercial aviation, the main problemlnS business aviation is the availability of adequate airportacilities in the South East of England.     The Civil Aviationthority and the Standing Conference on London and South EastSional Planning have been studying thi3 issue and thus have^Plemented the Government1s consultations on airport strategy,o produced two reports as the basis for consultationsconcerned and for their advice to the Government onThey havWi*h tho0Iae facilities for general aviation in the South East,that advice the CAA and the Standing Conference concluded thatlisting aerodromes should be able to accommodate theejcpg^-f.- ,teo- growth in general aviation if their facilities were^Provedea and if business aviation were accorded some precedence
over recreational flying, particularly at a number of selectedaerodromes.1U7     The BAA recognises the importance of interlining to business avaition and it is the Authorityfs policy to allowprovision for business aviation movements at Heathrow andGatwick.     However, with increasing congestion particularly at heathrow in the peak hours the BAA considers that it shouldgivepriority to air transport movements, which utilise scarceresources to the benefit of the greatest number of air passen e1,and freight.     The Government supports the BAA in this policy-&apos;but it recognises as a result the need for alternative accommodation for business aviation in the South East, intoparticular at locations readily accesible to Central London,industry on the outskirts of London and to scheduled inter-national air services.     Following the advice of the CAA anoStanding Conference, based on their studies and the consult3they have undertaken, the Government considers that the airP tat Biggin Hill, Leavesden, Luton, Northolt, Southend and Staflcould satisfactorily fill that role.1U8     Luton, Southend and Stansted are fully developedcommercial airports with the ability to handle all types ofbusiness aviation including executive jets.     But none of
fulfils the requirement for a business aviation airport close to London and to   Heathrow and Gatwick.     The CAA identifiedBiggin Hill and Northolt as meeting this last and most importantrequirement.     Northolt, which is only 5 miles from Heathrow, isowned by the Ministry of Defence and while the Ministry isbilling to continue to make the aerodrome available for civiloperations, there are environmental and operational constraints,Elating to the runway and its proximity to Heathrow which limit the type and number of movements by civil aircraft at Northolt.In view of the limited extent to which further civil useof Northolt is possible, the CAA and Standing Conferenceeoncluded that to accommodate demand from the North and We3t ofLondon greater use might be made of Leavesden for non-jetbusiness aviation.     Leavesden airport which is 25 miles from london and close to the Ml and M25 is owned by the Ministry ofDefencieasee and is at present on lease to Rolls Royce Ltd. Theirexpires in June 1978 and discussions are currently being6^ to decide future arrangements.In the light of the limited additional use that can be^de of Northolt and Leavesden, especially by executive jets,the Government believes that the future use of Biggin Hill isOf TiParticular importance.     Biggin Hill, which is owned by theri(ion Borough of Bromley, is 15 miles from central London and
within UO minutes of Gatwick and 70 minutes of Heathrow by r0*The Government proposes, therefore, to open discussions wi*&quot;Borough Council and others concerned with a view to establi8Biggin Hill as a major business aviation airport for the Lon^area.     Improvements in its facilities would be required anathis role it would become an integral part of the London air?system.      In these circumstances the Borough Council may fsvoJa transfer of ownership to the BAA.     Plying clubs now at ^eaerodrome may need to be relocated since these may not be compatible with an extended role for Biggin Hill as a busine89aviation aerodrome.151     A final but important aspect of general aviation i0helicopter operations.     The Government recognises the needfor and the advantages of a heliport terminal in London, ^might be operated by the BAA.      The Government is anxioushelicopter services to the capital should continue and i1-maintain close contact with the operators of such services the local authorities who lay down the conditions for theof heliports, both on future developments and the environ^implications of such operations.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSDEVELOPMENT OP A NATIONAL AIRPORTS SYSTEM152     The strategy for a national airports policy outlined inthis Y/hite Paper is based on the recognition that the air transport industry through the provision of speedy andconvenient travel makes a valuable contribution to the economy;the principle that air transport facilities should not ingeneral be subsidised by the taxpayer or ratepayer;    the need to take careful account of the environmental impact of airport^velopments;    the more effective use of existing airport andother infrastructure resources;    the adoption of a flexibleapproach in planning and development which can be related tothe gp0Wth in demand;    and the importance of consulting thosedeemed with airports in the development of policy.153 t^n the South East, additional capacity is necessary inthe iqpn-7uus to meet the forecast demand for air travel; inother oareas there are underused and loss-making airports. TheVernmentfs objective is to achieve a greater use of airportsOUtsidf, 4.x.^c wie South East, but the diversion of passengers withClns        destinations in the South East to airports in other^ts   0f* 4.vW1  one country neither makes sense in transport terms nor would it i ,*** -Lead to an overall decrease in the numbers of peoplecu oy aircraft noise. The limited scope for divertinggers from the London airports to those in other regionsaoea fttherefore remove the demand for additional airport
capacity in the South East of England.      However,  in the lightof uncertainties both in the scale and geographical pattern of demand ynd the continuing requirement for restraint in public expenditure, there is a need for particular caution in theconsideration of projects involving the commitment of vastpublic resources.15Ll     In present circumstances clearly foreseeable demands inthe London area should be met by bringing forward proposals f0the limited expansion of the existing airports.     Outside theLondon area, air services should be encouraged to concentrateat a few selected regional airports which might thereby be ableto offer a range and frequency of service to meet local demand and at the same time provide a stimulus to air travel outsidethe South East of England.THE DEMAND ?0i\ AIR TRANSPORT155     In 1976 Uh million passengers used airports in GreatBritain and 31 million of these passed through the four LondQjlairports of Heathrow, Gatwick., Stansted and Luton.      It is forecast that in 1990 the number of passengers at all airPortSin Great Britain will be between 86 and 117 million and at ^eLondon airports between 66 and 89 million.     Two-thirds of ^eforecast increase is attributed to the growth of leisure tra^Forecasting over so long a period involves considerable
uncertainties, but the continuing rapid growth of leisuretraffic in the London area is subject to particular uncertainty,since it involves the ability of London to accommodate everincreasing numbers of tourists, the extent to which foreigntourism can be attracted to areas away from London, and the way in which the domestic demand for leisure flights will develop in the regions where demand has hitherto lagged far behind thatin the South East.The forecasts suggest continued growth after 1990, butthe prospects for the 1990s and beyond are a matter of even greater uncertainty.     The Government has concluded that:the present forecasts represent the best availableguide for the period up to 1990 but, in view ofthe uncertainties, it has decided to monitor thepresent forecasts and keep the assumptions andmethodology under review, with a view to thepreparation of forecasts for the late 1990s and beyond.THE London area15?Cn the basis of the latest air traffic forecasts the&quot;&quot;rrjnent has reached or confirmed the following conclusions
on the handling of demand in the South East up to 1990.(2) There is no requirement for or possibility of anew airport and the decision to abandon the Icapl111airport project is reaffirmed.(3) The BAA proposals for a fourth terminal at Heathrowairport to raise the capacity to 38 million passersa year should be examined at a public inquiry.(U)     Proposals should be brought forward by the BAA ?oVa second terminal at Gatwick airport to raise the capacity to 25 million passengers a year.(5) Proposals should be brought forward by the BAA toextend capacity at Stansted Airport to handle hmillion passengers a year.(6) Capacity at Luton Airport should be restricted tocater for 5 million passengers a year.158     The four airports together would thus provide a totalcapacity for the London area of about 72 million passengers-- theGiven the particular uncertainties about the higher end 01range of air traffic forecasts, and the need to avoid thepremature and perhaps unnecessary commitment of costly anarisk new airport developments, the Government regards theseproposed developments as sufficient for accommodating air
in the London area during the 1980s.     The proposed developmentsa* (h) (5) and (6) will, like that at (3) he subject to the^cesasry planning procedures and these, together with the wayln which demand for air travel develops, will be relevant to the^der and timing of the various projects.     There should be nofather expansion of the London airports in the current phase ofairport strategy.159In the longer term additional capacity will almostainly De required in the London area.      However, theei*nment accepts that limits should be placed on the growth of e-^-sting airports and has concluded that:(7)     Heathrow&apos;s ultimate development would be limitedto not more than four terminals;( )     the proposal for a second runway at Gatwick shouldnot be revived, which effectively limits develop-ment at Gatwick to a two terminal airportj(9)Luton airport is not suitable for development as a major airport to accommodate more than the5 million passengers envisaged in conclusion (6).Witha continuing increase in the use of larger aircraft
and improvements in air traffic control, any longer termprovision for the London area should not involve theconstruction of a four runway airport as envisaged in theearlier Stansted and Roskill proposals.     In the light ofthis, the Government will consider how additional capacitybeyond 1990 can be provided.     This will include(10) (a)    a major expansion of Stansted; or(b) the development of an existing militaryairfield as a civil airport; or(c) the construction of a new airport.THE REST OF ENGLAND AND WALES161      Outside the South East it is not envisaged thatanyairports whether for passenger or cargo traffic will bebieve 9required.      The Government believes that efforts to acru-greater use of airports outside the South East will beey.by the development of a coherent airports policy which ssome rationalisation of the existing pattern of airportidentifies a limited range of airoorts at v/hich oassi9services might be concentrated.      In addition, the Govciconsiders that it should be possible to achieve a great
air,Ports outside the South East by charter and leisure servicesBering for British holiday makers travelling overseas and bydoming tourist traffic.The Government has reached the following conclusionsLevant to the development of regional airports in Englandand Wales.(11) There is no requirement for a new airport outsidethe South East of England and with the preponder-ance of cargo carried on passenger aircraft an allcargo airport would not be viable.(12) Manchester International airport, which is within an Assisted Area, is well located to serveimportant centres of population and industry andhas adequate facilities to meet expected demanduntil at least 1990.     It should consolidate its position as a gateway international airport and asthe principal airport outside the South East ofEngland.(13)There is no requirement for a second gatewayairport, but elsewhere/here in Central England,Birmingham and East Midlands airports, as categoryB airports, should fulfil important roles inserving the requirements of the Midlands for short
and medium range scheduled and charter services.Leeds/Bradford airport should fulfil a similar,though less extensive role, in the smallercatchment area of Yorkshire and Humberside. Inthe longer term, depending on the development of demand, East Midlands airport may assume a widerrole in the national airports system.(1U)    In Northern England demand is likely to remaininsufficient to justify a gateway internationalairport.     Newcastle airport, as the main regionS^category 3 airport for the region, should conti^ueto maintain its existing advantage over Tees-sideairport in terms of the amount of traffic and the range of services, hut the location of Tees-sideairport is such that it can be expected to havecontinuing role as a category C airport.(15) In South Wales and South West England the catch&apos;ment areas of the various airports are small-Glamorgan airport, with its modern but underutilised facilities, should develop as the c&amp;uB airport in this area.(16) Apart from the airports considered in conclus*o11(12) to (15), no other airport in England andWales is expected to fulfil a significant rolewithin a national strategy, though a number 0*t ifl^ethese other airports can be expected to confcJ-
to cater for local needs as either category Cor D airports.scotland^3      The Scottish airports can be considered separately, but their future cannot be divorced from decisions on devolution,^ae four principal airports in Scotland are owned by the british airports Authority and over the last five years virtually a newairport has been built at Edinburgh, extensive new facilitieshave been provided at Aberdeen, while Glasgow and Prestwick areWeH equipped to meet the traffic demand.     The Government hasconcluded that:(l?)    there is no requirement for a new airport in central Scotland;(18)    generally any modification in the roles of thethree lowland airports at Prestwick, Glasgow and edinburgh should be a matter for the proposedScottish Assembly; (19)   Sumburgh aerodrome should be acquired by the BAAfrom the CAA;J(19A)    the future arrangements for the /remaining^Highlands and Islands aerodromes should be decided by the Scottish Assembly;charging policies at the Highlands and Islandsaerodromes should be developed to provide thatoil related traffic at these aerodromes is notsubsidised by the taxpayer.
GENERAL AVIATION1(514.    General aviation, which includes all flying other the operations of major airlines, is an important user ofairport facilities.     Adequate provision for private and recreational flying is generally available throughout thecountry, but business aviation which sometimes requires the runway and navigational facilities of a major airport placeSan additional demand on the capacity of airports in the SouEast of England.      The Government believes that the requireof business aviation in the South East call for specificrecognition and it has concluded that:(21)    the airports at Biggin Hill, Leavesden, Luton,Northolt, Southend and Stansted should meet thedemand;(22)    discussions should take place with the LondonBorough of Bromley and others concerned with aview to establishing Biggin Hill as the majorgeneral aviation airport for the London area to its possible acquisition by the british airports Authority;(23)    adequate helicopter facilities should be provl. , r topossibly by the British Airports Authority,meet demand for helicopter services to ano-central London.
JKPLSIHSKTATION OP THE STRATEGYI65     The Government will take account of airports policy inissuing permits for scheduled and charter services hy overseasoperators.     With regard to British operators, and similarly,the Civil Aviation Authority in considering applications for new services and the renewal of existing licences will he expected to take account of airports strategy in accordancewith the policy guidance which has been given to the Authority.166     Losses at local authority airports in England and V/alese currently running at  5-6 million a year.     While the8uhsia&quot;ies for air transport in the Highlands and Islands areParticular exception, there can be no general justificationforsubsidising airports and air services.     At the local1rports which will remain under local authority control thereWillDe a continuing need for economies and the application of0licies aimed at reducing financial losses as effectively asPQssible.The Government will consider any proposals put forward by j0cal authorities and the BAA for the transfer of the owner-8hiP of -Uj- airports in the light of the Dolicy outlined in this*aPer.
ACCESS168     Adequate access to airports is an essential requirementand this will he among the factors taken into account by theDepartments concerned w ith road building programmes. //hereimprovements to local roads may be thought desirable to accon^0date increased traffic due to airport expansion, it must be 1the local authorities concerned to assess their priorities ^make any appropriate provision in their annual local transportDrogram-nes, on the basis of whose assessment TransportSupplementary Grants in England and 7/ales are distributed.In the Governments view,  it is desirable to make the best useof public transport, especially the important underground and rail connections available at Heathrow, Gatwick and Birminghal3There will be a continuing need for airport authorities andthose responsible for operating public transport services towork closely together.AIRCRAFT NOISEI69     Disturbance caused by aircraft nodse is the most serioaproblem associated v/ith air transport operations.     Over thenext 15 years there should be a marked decline in the numbe?people adversely affected by aircraft noise.     However, theGovernment will continue to develop policies to reduce theonimpact of this nuisance and to seek international agreementmore stringent noise standards for aircraft.     In pursuithese objectives the Government has decided;nit of(2U)    to continue its efforts to find an alternati*e

Nevertheless, it recognises the concern that was8ed in the course of the consultations that theon of existing major airports could continue almosttely, leading to an erosion of the environment and tor*cuit :for the local authorities responsible for0 the areas affected.     Accordingly, the Government ha3that limits should be placed on the development ofsome airports when circumstances make thisaPpropriate and that these should be defined interms of the number and size of terminals to behuilt;^    to diseu3CU83 with the 3AA, and the local authority
