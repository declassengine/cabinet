Document is the property of her britannic majesty-s government copy no 80cp(78) 1915 February 1978cabinetFULL EMPLOYMENT, COMPETITIVENESS AND TAX RELIEFMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster. A great deal of present day unemployment is due to lack of adequatedemand.     Important among the reasons fo.* this lack of demand are inter-national imbalances in world trade.     The immediate mechanical consequenceto a surplus country \8 a net addition to aggregate demand and a cor re s-ponding loss of demand in the deficit country.    In the one, buoyant demandresults in the fullest use of resources;  in the other, depressed demandresults in underuse of resources and unemployment.2. But none of this is a good leason why anxieties about periods of temporary deficit should cause us to accept a shortfall of demand. the mechanical consequence of deficit is not inevitable:  it can be avoided ormitigated by policy decisions.     Many countries that run a chronic current account deficit have shown that extra resources acquired as the result of. a trade deficit, far from reducing employment prospects can be used tcimprove those prospects.3. In the case of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC) surplus we have recognised the inevitability of a resultant aggregatedeficit for a long period ahead.    We also recognise the need to ensure thattheir inability to utilise the whole of the demand transferred from ourpeoples&apos; hands to theirs do*e not create a gap in demand.    But so far this principle has been accepted more in theory than in practice.4- In addition to the mechanical shortfall in demand that OPEC and otherdeficits tend to create, for many years a developed country facing a balanceQ* payments deficit has been under considerable pressure to get back into&quot;equilibrium&quot; quickly.     This has usually meant policies of contraction. Thegreat defect of such policies, however, is that they decrease rather thanincrease long run competitiveness.     They inhibit investment and technicalProgress, depress the morale of the business community and of workers.That is why we should not at any time believe that we are improving our balance of payments prospects by underuse of resources.    Any temporarygains are bought by weakening our economic strength to deal with longer-term tasks.    Deflation tends to lessen competitiveness.
5. Economic policy should start with a recognition that the sustainedoptimum use of a country1 s economic resources, human and material, is the route to maximum competitiveness and that &quot;gains&quot; on balance of paymentsobtained by the creation of unnecessary idle capacity are temporary and the losses enduring.    To pursue this type of policy, however, requires more time than a developed country is normally allowed to correct a deficit. Theconstructive policy can be pursued successfully, given time, and with thetwin objectives of avoiding demand deflation and mitigating price inflation&apos;lower direct and indirect taxation would help in both those aims.    In animproving situation the first claims on public expenditure should be those that help to reduce the cost of living for large numbers of people - eg. school meals and nationalised industries prices6- The present international monetary system does not serve these purposes.    Instead of enabling countries in deficit to use the investmentthey are receiving to fill up the gap in demand created by deficits, our system brings immense pressure to discourage them from doing it. Thesystem has a built-in bias towards deflation and is, in no small part,responsible for the present level of unemployment in the developed world.Every improvement in international co-operation in dealing with internationaldisequilibrium gives us greatsr freedom of action at home.    That is why thisGovernment1 s efforts in this direction have been so crucially relevant.&apos;* The conclusions are that:1. Far from a balance of payments deficit being a constraintupon the fullest use of our resources it is a compelling reason forutilising them fully in order to preserve and enhance competitiveness.2. The danger of price inflation, when stimulation of demand is appropriate, can be countered if reflation takes the form of taxreductions, and similar measures, which help reduce prices andlabour costs and enlist popular support and co-operation.3. These objectives of full utilisation of our resources,improved competitiveness and curbing of inflation, pursued withcourage, tempered with reasonable caution, can dispel the fatalistconcept that large scale unemployment is inevitable in the years ahead.H LCabinet Office*4 February 1978Z
