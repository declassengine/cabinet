confidential the NATIONALISED industries I INTRODUCTION^*   This White Paper replies to the recommendations in the report ofNovember 1976 by the National Economic Development Office, &quot;A study of UK Nationalised Industries:    their role in the economy and controlln tne future.&quot;   It takes into account the Government&apos;s proposals for^eveloping industrial democracy in the nationalised industries, and1 exPlains the Governments main proposals in response to theroPort of August 1976 by the National Consumer Council on &quot;Consumersand the Nationalised Industries&quot;.2The White Paper is about the control of the nationalised industries,**e*r financial and economic objectives, and their relations with**0Vernment. It sets out proposals designed to reconcile the purposesOfPublic ownership with the independence needed for vigorous and fjterPrising management;    and to ensure that the nationalisedn(iUstries employ resources efficiently to the benefit of the whole^unity.    Section II describes a number of institutional changesntended to improve the relationship between the nationalised*tU!iiftt -lpies and Government, unions, customers and suppliers. Ita*ns how information on the industries main objectives, agreedafter h-aJ.scussion between the Government and the boards, and on theirrfnance will be published.    Section III discusses the financialarui eoCQnomic framework within which the industries will operate,and inn Particular the role of the financial targets which will besned for all the industries and used as a measure of their&quot;^SS. ... .le central problem in evolving an acceptable relationshipeHeon t u^ne Government and the nationalised industries has alwayshow best
to reconcile the boards1 need for sufficient freedom to manage theindustries with the Governments legitimate interests in them. TheGovernment must be concerned in the strategies, and operationaldecisions of public importance, of industries which are basic to thenational economy;    in seeing that these industries, which are not subject to the private sector discipline of the threat of bankruptcy,and are in some cases relatively free from market pressures, areefficient;    and in ensuring that there is an acceptable return on thepublic capital invested    in them.4.   The last general review of the economic and financial principlescommon to all nationalised industries was the White Paper of 1967,&quot;Nationalised Industries:    a review of economic and financial object-ives,&quot; Cmnd 3437.   That White Paper was intended to show how investment,pricing and efficiency policies would be taken into account in settingfinancial objectives, rather than to make any change in t he basicrelationship between the Government and the nationalised industries.It explained that, subject to allowance where necessary for socialobjectives or for meeting statutory obligations, it was the government&apos;s policy to treat the nationalised industries as commercial bodies sofar as the expected return on investment was concerned.   It set outcriteria for investment appraisal and pricing policy, which were intended to ensure that the nationalised industries did not claimresources which could have been put to better use in other parts ofthe economy.    It stressed the importance of setting the industriesclear financial targets which would serve both as an incentive to management and as one of the standards by which success or failure*ould be judged.
CONFIDENT]ALThese principles wore endorsed by the Select Committee on nationalised Industries and generally accepted as setting a soundDasis for future relations and control.    In practice, however, thenew approach did rot last,  and in the first half of the 1970s theNations between governments and the industries deterio rated,^is arose in part because of disagreements and uncertainty overt^e Plans of particular industries.        But-,     the main single factor?j&quot;ich undermined the principles in the 1967 White Paper was thePrice restraint policies of the early 1970s.    The Post Office and gas and electricity industries were forced into deficit and fortne first time ever had to be subsidised to cover their losses,totalled  1182 million over the period.   The grants which were? peady being paid to British Rail escalated as their fares andc^arges were held down and their deficit increased.    As a resultofthese policies, the financial targets of most of the nationalisedlnQ,ustries had to be abandoned and there was little chance to put^e 1967 principles to the test.6. T*n its report of December 1973? &quot;Capital Investment Procedures&quot;,^e SCNl concluded that government had failed to meet its objectiveexercising its control publicly and according to well-definedrules, without interfering with the management functions offtdustries themselves&quot;. The Committee accordingly recommended the Government should arrange for &quot;a detailed study of theUl the nationalised industries in the economy and of the waynich they are to be controlled in the future&quot;.n dune 1975, in its reply to the SCNI1s report, the Governmentn0unced that it had asked the NEDO to undertake this enquiry.
*e NEDO published their report on 18 November 1976. It is a searchingand highly critical examination of the relations between the industries and governments.    In his introduction to the report, the Directorcnerai of the? NEDO writes:-&apos;Our enquiry has left us in no doubt that the existing framework of relationships, developed under governments of both main political parties, is unsatisfactory and in need of radical change&quot;.Many of the industries, in their written evidence to the Select8.Com&apos;nittec on Nationalised Industries,* generally agree with the NEDO&apos;sanaix however,* xysis of the problems.Some,/comment that their relations with theirsponsoring departments have always been generally good and othersaSree that they have recently improved.    Indeed the NEDO acknowledgetheir criticisms do not apply to relationships with all the^   t &quot;-tonalised industries or for all the time to particular industries,overnment agrees, nevertheless, with their general conclusionrelations had deteriorated in the period up to the mid-1970snceded to be improved.   The NEDO present a perceptive and thought-nalysis of the problems and, while the Government does not acceptni th .neir proposals, itwelcomes their report as offering a basis onhoth the Government and tie   industries can now build.the Gn Sy^rnmcntfs general approachn 197^i the Government set out to put the nationalised industriesn to a sound economic and financial footing.    This requiredSubstantial price increases to phase out the subsidies necessitatedrestraint, described in paragraph 5 above.^,,c 3/?\0d by the SCNI in tneir Second Special Report of 1976-77,&quot;Comments by Nationalised Industries on the NEDO Report.&quot;
industries as a resuJt, the/ are generally in a much stronger financial position than they have been for a number of years.   The period of rapid price increases needed to deal with the deficits due to price restraint inthe early 1970s is over.   A more stable, and better, climate of relationship has been established and it is, therefore, now timely to review, aid where necessary develop, the principles in t he 1967 white paper.   The Government considers that this review, together with theother measures discussed in this White Paper, will lay the foundationsfor further improvement.10.   -    An important point which must be emphasised from thebeginning   is that apart from thefact of public ownership and control many of the nationalised industriescompetitive position,have little in common.    They vary in size, objectives/markets, financial strength, and social significance.   The individual energ3&apos; and transport industries are subject to overall policies for the sectors in whichthey operate .    The formation of tlie two new manufacturing corporations,British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders, brings about a furthersignificant shift in the balance of the nationalised industries away from the historical predominance of the public utilities serving aBritish market.   The three manufacturing industries - Steel, Aerospaceand Shipbuilding - together with British Airways and the british national Oil Corporation all operate in highly competitive internationalMarkets with their prices largely set by international trading conditions.U is important that these industries, and indeed those which arecompeting in domestic markets, are able to respond quickly to0Pportunities and competitive forces and that the Governments arrange-ments with them should recognise this.    It follows that, while there8re a number of important principles of wide application, it isessential throughout to take account of the varying circumstances ofworkthe different   industries and to be ready to find solutions and a frame-/
0f.control appropriate to the particular needs and market situations0f each of thorn. This need for a flexible approach to match circum-st-ances is recognised by the NEDO.11 .   The NEDO discuss in some detail the crucial question whetherthe Government should aim to stand back from the industries, and operate an &quot;arms-length&quot; relationship, or whether it should be involved more closely.    Their conclusions on this are worth quoting:-&quot;It seems to us that the thinking behind the wholly arm&apos;slength approach is based on a false analogy with the private sector.    The financial structures and displines in the public and private sectors are very different - not least becausethe ultimate sanction of liquidation is in practice absentin the major nationalised industries.    Moreover, their importance as employers, suppliers and customers, and theeconomic and social implications of their actions make it right as well as inevitable that government should take a close interest in their strategies.   The issues of public policy involved are so large and politically sensitivethat it is not realistic to suppose that they would ever beleft for long   to management alone to determine, subject onlyto periodic checks on their financial performance.&quot;Thegovernment agrees with this.   The question  is how bestconstruct with each industry a relationship which is sufficiently0se* but in which the responsibilities and objectives of both theiriment and the industry are well defined and well understood.G
CONFIDENTIALII    INSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALSSSamtructurc&apos;2.   The NEDO recommend a radical change in the current institutional^angements.   As a general approach, but with modifications to suit^stances, they propose that each nationalised industry should beru&quot; by a Policy Council responsible for strategy and a Corporation^ acting as the executive authority.   The Policy Council would he&quot;ndcr a President of high personal standing,&apos; and preferably a part-^r.   It would include the Chairman and some members of theorp0rPoration Board, representatives of the main interest groups concernedsthe industry - Government Departments, trade unions, and customersand also members reflecting other independent viewpoints.    It woulduPported by a small staff seconded from departments, the Corpora-0n and trade unions.    Its main functions would be to agree corporate^ectives and the strategies to achieve them;    tocstablish perform-a^cecriteria;    to aidorse corporate plans;    and to monitor performance.The Corporation Board would manage the industry within the frame-of these objectives, strategies and criteria. One of the main01  the President of the Policy Council would be to protect the^ration Board, which would have a separate Chairman, from inter-v&apos;enticn by Government in carrying out its responsibilities.    The PolicyCoUnCii* would appoint the Chairman and members of the Board.M. T,e Government agrees that, in dealing with the nationalisedies,  its main concern should he with strategic and major issuesLtian with day to day management.   It also generally acceptsargumcnt that the evolution of strategic plans for nationalisedn(1Ustrj consultation betweengf should be a combined operation,  involving/the interest which are closely concerned with their content and implementationCn often have the power to frustrate them if they wish. However,
ho Government does not accept that NEDO&apos;s proposal for Policy Counciland Corporation Boards is the best way of achieving these objectives and of improving its relations with the industries.1j*   Before reaching this conclusion the Government discussed the^proposal with the nationalised industries, and took account of the comments in their published evidence to the SCNI.    None of thendustries favours - and some reject in very, strong terjns - the^proposal for a Policy Council standing in line of command between? -Minister and an executive Board which runs the industry. TheySoUfne that Ministers would not delegate their present powers, or0nccrn with matters of major importance, to the Policy Council (andaPj;ears to be implicit in the NEDO&apos;s proposal if it were toCnieve the desired objective of limiting Ministerial intervention).This *assumption is right.   The Government is the sole shareholder ofe hationaJised industries, and their principal banker;    and, as theNEDoacknowledge,  the industries    strategies and main policy decisionsAVe questions of major political and public importance with whichthe r0vernment must be concerned.ir*e Government believes that, contrary to the NEDO s objectives,^hesearrangements would slow down the process of decision making and*0*Udconfuse responsibility and accountability.    The Minister and the*Cv Council would both be concerned with strategic and major issuesunctions of the Policy Council and the Corporation Board/would0VerldP because, as many of the industries have pointed out, theinction between strategic and executive decisions is not inice always as sharp and as clear cut as NEDO&apos;s proposals imply.Thus1 Lhe Government, the Policy Council and the Corporation Board&quot;li be concerned with strategic and major issues, and insteadOf*arifying responsibilities and streamlining decisions, the NEDO&apos;s
inproPosals would add an additional layer of authority, expressede8islation, in a Policy Council whose own responsibilities would inPractice have unclear demarcation lines.17 A*   a number of the nationalised industries have also pointed out their present boards are supported by management committees whichdealwith many of the day to day issues involved in the running of10 business.    These arrangements are flexible and tailored to thee(Iuirements of the particular industry whose Chairman can readilyModifythem if necessary.    They are, however, fundamentally differenta statutory two tier structure, with the powers and functionsof t,e senior board &quot;explicitly and formally distinguished from thoseXecutive management,&quot; as proposed by NEDO.,&amp;. TAn their paper of November 1977 to the SCNI, the NEDO havelcised the industries&apos;  reactions to their proposal for PolicyIs and Corporation Boards.    They argue that it is unacceptableforthe industries to agree generally with their analysis of thenSs of the arrangements in the past but to reject any proposalsfop str.wuctural or other changes to ensure a better and more stablereiat.iQnship in future.    While the Government recognises the deficienc-which led the NEDO to make their recommendations, many have been0v0rc0rne since NEDO conducted their study and the Government does notagreetnat it follows that major structural changes in the boardsa*e a necessary condition of maintaining the recent improvement inUo*ships.Thne fact that the Government does not intend to introduce Policy^       s and Corporation Boards does not mean, however, that it rejectsarSurnent that changes are necessary to bring about further improve-nentsri     &apos;    The Government is alreadyVoloplng a number of new arrangements on the lines proposed by NEDO,
and it will now introduce others.   Later parts of this Sectionexplain the various ways in which the main interest groupsconcerned with the industries will be more involved in the formulation of their policies, either by board membershipor by improved consultative and participative arrangements.The procedures for the discussion of corporate plans arebeing developed with t h?   aim of giving them a central placein the relationship between the nationalised industries andthe sponsoring departments, and of providing a systematicframework for reaching agreement on long term objectives andstrategies.    Information on these plans, on financial targets and any sectoral or social objectives set to the industries,On cash limits, and on performance and service indicatorsand aims will be published in the industries  annual reports and accounts.   These arrangements, and the proposed new powerto give specific directions where necessary, will help toofclarify the respective roles of the Boards and/the Government,and they will provide a better basis for Parliament and thepublic to judge the performance of the industries and the role of the Government in their operations.
CONFIDENTIALNew Powers to issue specific directions to Boards20    The present statutes empower the Secretary of State to givethe Boards directions of &quot;a general character&quot; on matters which appear to him to affect the national interest and, in some cases,directions on particular subjects which are specified in the statutes.However, the power to give general directions does not allow theSecretary of State to direct an individual industry on a particularmatter, however important, unless that particular power of directionis specified in the statutes.    In the absence of powers to give specificdirections, governments have had to rely on a process of persuasion.Because this has been informal, accountability for decisions hason occasions been blurred and this has caused friction and resentment.The Government considers that this s situation should be avoided, andthat it is wrong in principle that a Minister cannot statutorilyof major importanceintervene in specific matters/subject to the approval of Parliament.^t agrees, therefore, with NEDO that the present powers should beextendcd to remedy this deficiency by enabling the Minister to give aBoard cither general or specific directions on matters which appearedto him to affect the national interest.   An important advantage of thenew power would be that when a direction was given it would clarifyAccountability by indicating formally and publicly where the Govern-mcnt had decided to overrule a Board&apos;s judgement or to direct it to^0 something in the national interest.    The Government will put forward and in the case of theProposals accordingly for amendment of the statutes ,/electricityffPply industry it has included a provision in the Electricity and^Vciear Materials Bill introduced in February.*   &apos;lhese legislative proposals will include a number of safeguards.^Minister would not be able to issue a specific direction before he^as consulted the industry in question.   The direction would be in the0rm of a statutory instrument, subject to Parliamentary procedures.
The.Minister would be required to publish, when the statutorynstrument was presented, an estimate of the extra cost if any to thelndustry of implementing the direction.   If the industry did not agree^vj-th . , .this, their estimate would be published with the GovernmentsCommPnf where appropriatec,its on it.    Compensation would be paid/to cover the extra costand titne legislation would provide for this.    There would also bes to override, where necessary and subject to European Community^gations, any other statutory duties with which the specificdirect- iCion might conflict.    It would not be possible to make a specificdirectiOion which would have the effect of extending or restricting the^hg statutory powers of an industry;    that would be a matter for&apos;)rimary legislation.22.Parliament approves these powers the Government intends to use^ sParingiy.    One of the themes running through this White paper is tnat the relationship between governments and nationalised industriesis0seJ    and there will continue to be many issues on which theies and the Government will reach agreement without the issueCific directions and without any confusion of responsibility0uhtability.    Moreover, Ministers do not intend that, as a0r the availability of this power, they should be drawn intointervention or Parliamentary discussion of a multitude of^tersinQf day to day management, which should in principle, and mustPract iLAce, be left to those responsible for managing and runningse   .Ustries without the intervention of Ministers or Parliament.
CONFIDENTIAL ^Lii^nd appointment of hoard members23.   When the Review Body on Top Salaries in their Sixth Reportrecommcnded revised salaries for nationalised industry Board Membersarul Chairmen for 1 January 1975 the Government deferred a decisionn the recommendations for wider policy reasons.   As a result thepav of Board Members and Chairmen has fallen sharply in real terms,far more so relatively than that of most other people, and there areanomalics in the pay structure in many of the industries with board^&quot;ibers earning less than some senior staff working for them.2/     ^ - -*   un 15 December the Government announced that the most thatCoulcl be allowed at the present time was a 5% general increase from1 January 197S, with up to W% for the less well paid board memberstaPered to ensure that the 5% applied above  13,000 a year. InGaching this decision the Government had regard to the measures. ^1 being taken in the national interest to control inflation which0ntinue to demand considerable restraint from all sections of the0nUnunAty.    The Government recognised that this still leavestaonalised industry board members significantly out of line withcounterparts, and it will look again at the way forward whenthe j)p. .eview Body on Top Salaries makes its next recommendations forAprii 1978.
25.   All appointments to Boards will continue to be made by the responsible Minister who will consult the Chairman of the industry concerned on each appointment, and call on the Public AppointmentsUnit in the Civil Service Department when appropriate.   A numberof the industries have been critical of delays in filling vacancies0n the boards.    This is sometimes unavoidable but the Governmentpeadily accepts that the aim must be to avoid delays wherever possible.
-^^composition of boards26 -   The composition of each board will be settled on an industryb* industry basis by the Ministers concerned after discussion withth* Chairmen.   The Governments proposals for the appointment ofemployee representatives are explained in paragraphs 28 and 29 on industrial democracy;   and, as pointed out in paragrajh 30, consumertoteRibers will be appointed to some boards.    The Government will continueaPPoint part-time non-executive members who are not representativeof -interest groups but who have the experience to make an important contribution to the running of the industries.*ne Government has also decided that in some industries a civilant from the sponsoring department, and in a few cases from theSUry too, will be appointed to boards after consultation with theairmen concerned.   The purpose is to give the department a clearerlerstanding of the industry, and a better insight into its problems,but th^Government also recognises that in the different circumstancesOf thvarious industries appointment of civil servants to the boardslot necessarily be the best way of securing this result in everyinf3ustrv.    It will, however,  be worthwhile where it means that theGoVerrment can be aware at an earlier stage than now of the thinkingne boards and, for their part, the boards can have a clearer&apos; at a formative stage of their planning, of the wider objectivesPlications of Government policy.    There is a potential*Uffil,-*ty arising from the dual allegiance which a civil servantave to his Minister on the one hand and as a board member^ uie corporate responsibility of the Board on the other hand.G as this duality does not in practice produce irreconcilablecj it presents no obstacle to adopting the arrangement. Therealready civil servants on the boards of the British National OilLion and of the Atomic Energy Authority.    This has worked well
and their presence has proved useful both for the Government and for he two Corporations.    The practical course is to experiment withthe arrangenent in other cases also where it is expected to be helpful.
industrial Democracy28.- Management&apos; and the unions in tho nationalised industries arealready making progress in developing new arrangements for consult-ation and participation.    In the Post Office they have agreed onan experiment, lasting for two years, for a new Board with, inEdition to the Chairmen, seven management and seven union members,and five independent members.   In some of the other industries, themanagement and the unions have chosen to put the emphasis on theimprovement of their existing consultative procedures rather than0n involvement at Board level.   The Government welcomes theseinitiatives, and intends to encourage progress in introducingand improving schemes of industrial democracy at all levels in the nationalised industries. It has accordingly asked the Chairmen ofthe nationalised industries to consult with the unions in each industry, where they are not already doing so, and to make JointProp0sals for rurther improvements in consultation and participation.T,&apos;e Government has asked the Chairmen to put forward their proposalsb* August 1978.   They might range from worker representation atBoard and lower levels to further developments in consultativeand Participative procedures.   It is likely that any proposals*htch emerge can go ahead quickly under present legislation.Hoover, if in any nationalised industries it is necessary to amend the statutes to allow for an experiment, or for new arrangements,the Government will introduce the necessary legislation, as it did0r the Post Office experiment.
^&apos;   Fhe Government will publish a White Paper on its views onne Way forward in industrial democracy in the private sector as a the nationalised industries.
30. In April 1975 the Government asked the National ConsumerCouncil (necessarily) to review the arrangements for consumer represented in the nationalised industries.   The recommendations in the KCCfsthorough and detailed report&quot; were not concerned with the manu-facturing industries such as the British Steel Corporatioivebx^conly with those industries which impinge directly on the/consumer,It was published in August 1976 and the Government has had wide-ranging consultations on its recommendations, some of when it hasalready implemented.   The- Government sees an important continuingrole for the nationalised industry consumer councils as spokesmenand guardians of the consumer interest, working in close associatic:with the necessarily at national, and v/ith local authority and otheradvisory services at local, level.   It also sees a role for consunesmembers on some nationalised industry boards.31, Power? of consiv^/t councils.   The necessarily&apos;were concerned thatnationalised industries should give more weight to the views oftheir consumer councils, and recommended in particular that theGovernment should have a power to issue directions to an industryfollowing consupier council recommendations; such powers already exist in respect of several of the nationalised industries concern;but there are some important exceptions.   For the most part, norm?lrelations between consumer councils and their industries will makeGovernment intervention of this kind unnecessary.    In most cases inwhich a consumer council makes a recommendation,the industry and ccuncilshouldbe able to reach agree-nent between themselves on the necessary action.   The same will be true also of discussions on the amount of information which theindustries should disclose to the councils   and the minimum periodof notice which they should give to them before implementing thercajor proposals.   In cases of disagreement it would be open to aconsumer council to make representations to the Government, -whichwould decide whether to give the industry a specific direction,using, where necessary, the new powers discussed in paragraphs20-22 above, and subject, as noted there, to any conflict with our-Treaty of Paris obligations.   Tha necessarily has also proposed that,^Consumers *nd the nationalised industries jj^ESport by/NationalConsumer Council to the Secretary of State  Prices end consumer protection.&quot; HMSOrnWP-ThwTTAL
V/U- ttJCHiwhenever an industry failed to act on a recommendation from itsconsumer council the Secretary of State should be required toissue a direction unless both Houses of Parliament, by Order, spec! ically agreed that he should not.   Tte Government does not accept this viev;: it considers that existing procedures are adequate&apos;toensure that Parliament has an opportunity to challenge ministerial decisions.    The Government, hov/ever, v/elcomes the proposal thatresearch reports by the councils should be available to theSelect Committee on Nationalised Industries, and notestnat the Select Committee already receives evidence from them.Energy.    In the light of the recommendatxns of the MCC and0* the Plov/den Committee, the Government has established anElectricity Consumers1 Council (ECC) for England and Wales,initially on a non-statutory basis.   The Council will fill animportant gap in previous arrangements by giving English and*,elsh electricity consumers an effective voice at national, as&apos;eH as regional, level, where it will operate alongside the^tional Gas and Domestic Coal Consumers&apos; Councils.   The Goverr-^rAhas introduced   legislation to make the ECCstatutory and to give it responsibility for co-ordinating regienr.&quot;electricity consumer representation.   The National Gas Consumers1Councii (MGCC) will continue to guide and co-ordinate the activitie0^ the regional councils to ensure that gas consumers1 viav;s areSiven coherent and authoritative expression.      /The Government alsrntends to introduce legislation giving the Domestic Coal Consur.c-rr0^iicil a statutory right to be informed by the Natbnal Coal 3oarnof *l&quot;ts plans, arrangements and proposals, and imposing a duty on0 Board to consider any representations made by the council.J Consumer Advice Centres and Citizens1 Advice Bureaux already^eal v/ith large numbers of enquiries and complaints about public^ector goods and services generally and the Government agrees withe necessarily that they are an easily identified and convenient source of    . .^  aQvice and help for consumers with problems of this kind-J-Uding domestic fuel problems,   Hov/ever, the GovernmentDol-;.Aeves that the regional gas and area electricity consumers1consultative councils, v/ith their district committees,-Quld continue to olay a valuable role as specialistsEdition to the generalist agencies, as well asw\*ale structure of the Electricity Supply Industry in England err?.Zq *1?&apos; report bv Committee of Enquiry&quot;to the Secretary of State-energy; cmnd Gy?2
Ceding in consumers1 views to the national bodies.   Over 2000experieiiced men   and women give their time voluntarily in this work and are available with advice and assistance to the publicoutside normal hours; they play an important part in advising localNationalised industry management and monitoring their performance,provide.the grassroots contact for formulating a consumer view^ national level.      The Government purposes to continue its supportthese bodies, but will have further discussions with the ECCNGCC and those responsible for the local authority and otherGeneralist services v/ith a view to ensuring the most efficientliaison and integration between the various advice agencies.pk.   The newly established National Energy Commission, on whichdomestic and industrial consumers are represented,will provide al^luable forum in which a consumer view can be brought to bear attile highest level.   The   Government has asked the necessarily to give the^lree energy consumer council representatives its support inOoo^dinating the Views of consumer and voluntary organisationsproviding research and secretarial services.^&apos;   Surface Transport.   The Government intends in due course, to^romote legislation to extend the powers of the existing Central&quot;^transport Consultative Committee, at present prescribed by Section^ 0? the Transport Act 1962.    It will be renamed the National^-sport Consumers1 Council (NTCC), and enabled to consider the^eral tariff structure of the British Railways Board1 s railway^passenger and parcels services; to consider a wide range of services facilities provided by other transport operators, including&quot;Usservices; and to make appropriate representations to theOrators, the Traffic Commissioners or the Price Commission, ase case may be.^&apos; ^he Government believes, however, that it would be inappropriate!- - CQniplaints about individual bus services to be handled by a^tin^ -&quot;-onal body.   Furthermore the proposed introduction of Publicatlsport Plans will place upon shire counties in England and^ 0?5 additional responsibilities in the planning of bus services.^hese circumstances the Government takes the view that countyCqUii^1s should set up, under their general powers, advisoryirn;!-committees v/ith representatives of consumer interests as well as

CONFIDENTIALOther consultative arrangements40.   In addition to the proposals discussed so far, the Governmentis developing other ways of involving the main interest groups in the forward planning of an industry or a sector.   Since 1974 the mainpolicy questions in the coal industry have been discussed on a tripartite basis between the Government, the Coal Board and thecoal unions.    Last year    the Secretary of State for Energyappointed an Energy Commission which will advise him on the developmentof an energy strategy for the United Kingdom and on other energy policy issues.   The Commission includes representatives of the energyindustries, and trade unions,and industrial, consumer and other interests.   The recent White Paper on Transport Policy, Cmnd 6S36,considered a number of ways in which the Government wanted to seeconsultation on the formulation and execution of transport policyimproved,  both at the local level and nationally.    In addition, theGovernment is exploring further with the NEDO and with both sides of industry its ideas of setting up an Ecohomic Development Committeefor transport as one means of promoting, in the context of theindustrial strategy, the regular consultation between the Government,management and the unions on plans for transport.
felaj-ioiis with suppliers  .    The NEDO point out that the nationalised industries&apos; technicalfinance and the scale of their purchases means that certain supplyingindustries h we become almost wholly dependent on their strategicVisions and related investment programmes.   Because of this several important studies have been commissioned by the National EconomicDovciopment Council since 1975 on various aspects of the relationship*t*een the industries and their suppliers.   This relationship is8eneraiiy close, and given the strong bond of common interest between two, the Government attaches a good deal of importance to this.thenumber of ideas and improvements were discussed in   a NEDO reportill Ifinpand the involvement of the nationalised industries in the0nom.ic Development Committees and associated NEDO working parties^ industrial strategy sector groups gives both the industries andsuppliers a forum for tackling further questions of common^rest.There is also considerable scope for the nationalised industries and th .neir suppliers to co-operate in export promotion to their mutual^efii-4-L.    The NEDO studies of this include detailed analyses of thenj-Cal specifications laid down by the nationalised industries,view to aligning them where possible with international require-*t8 se*Port orders;    and also the promotion of co-operation betweenlc,iised and private industry to allow them to compete togetherJQr overseas projects,  such as steelworks and railway construct-a rnoderni sation.     In 1976,    the nationalised industries set upVialA arrangements to promote coJlaboration between themselves andth*ir rClJstomers and suppliers in the pursuit and development of exports.b0 as to give the supplying industries a better chance of secur-
nEdition,  there are growing opportunities for sales of hardwareantl o quipment by nationalised Indus tries acting on t heir own account,0r in participation with the private sector. The Government strongly^conies a 11 these initiatives and the positive role which thenaUonalised industries are taking, both jointly with the privateS(?ctor and also on their own behalf in selling consultancy services to overseas countries and developing export Opportunities generally.
rnrporntc Plans and Investment and Financing Reviews0,   For many years the development plans and investment programmes of the nationalised industries, covering periods of 5 years ahead,have increasingly bee.n formulated within the wider context of both theindustries&apos; arid the Governments objectives and policies.   This processof corporate planning, covering various time periods, involves a continuing dialogue on long-term strategy, medium-term development plans, and annual   operating plans and budgets. The industries look to the Government for guidance on industrial policies, on economic prospects, and where appropriate on sectoral policies, including thesocial objectives underlying the payment of grant from public funds.The Government looks to the industries for data on markets, supplies and production.   The development of this process is more advanced with some of the industries than others.   Its benefits arealready becoming apparent in the energy sector where over the past year or so a joint Working Group on Energy Strategy (with membershipdrawn at Board level from the nationalised industries and from government Departments) has contributed materially to the harmonizationQf planning timetables and procedures, to the understanding of theindustries&apos; and Governments medium-term forecasting methods, and inParticular to the joint examination of the implications of alternativeenergy sector strategies for the plans and prospects of the industries.The process of joint examination of issues affecting policies and plansls now to be carried further in the recently formed Energy commission for Energyunaer the chairmanship of the Secretary of State/.    There have alsobeen valuable developments in corporate planning in other nationalised industries, and the legislation establishing British Aerospace andfUish Shipbuilders requires the two Corporations in formulating theirCorPorate plans to act on lines settled from time to time with the
approval&apos;or the Secretary of State for Industry. The Railways Act 19?/,lnade similar provision in relation to the Railways Board.The Government considers that the corporate plan, and the examina-tAon of strategic options, should have a central place in the relation-sh*P between the nationalised industries and their sponsoring depart-the^nts.   As Corporate planning is established more widely it will enableannual review of the industries&apos; medium-term investment programmes to take pis co in the context of known and understood longer termaLegies.   This is not to say that there will be no changes fromYe&quot; nto year in the five year plans of the industries for implementing^e agreed strategies.   The industries regularly revise their five yearProSramme, often substantially, to take account of changes in t heutlook for the economy, in the demand for their particular products,Relative costs and prices, in the burden of their financing require-* and in physical progress in the installation of new plants orOfew buildings.    Nationalised industries,  like any commercialnj-sation, must continue to show flexibility and to make such changesMo-reVer the strategic framework itself cannot be regarded as immutable.^J-me to time there are major long-term reviews of overall policy,CoyerinAng either the whole future strategy of an industry or someQJ- aspect of it, such as a technological decision on the choice of anew system. These represent an important turning point for anrv* and the Government accepts that, once long-term policyAOns are taken on this basis, they should not be reopened unless^il there has been a material change of circumstances.    So that% Se,lect Comnittee on Nationalised Industries,and the public, can6 bett- ter informed of the industries&apos;  objectives the Government has^4 thu,lem to publish in their annual reports and accounts a summary0jthGv. tne main points^    broad objectives in their corporate plan, and/in any major review,m     anv      Government     response to them.ThHat.     0 NEDO point out that the investment plans of a number of the^      &quot;-used industries have suffered over the years from interventionor ^Vernjncnts,  through short-term cuts to reduce public expendituredia. rouSh intervention in previously agreed strategic plans. Thebetneen the Government and industries in the corporate planning28
^rocess should help to provide a more stable framework. InEdition the Government has made two changes in its procedures whichD(Jlievcs improve the way in which the industries&apos; expenditure plansre handled and publicly presented.following an initiative in the NEDC, in 1975, Ministers agreednat they would aim to give the industries by the end of the summer,er than the end of year, approval for 100% of their agreed invest-nientProgramme for one year ahead, 85% for the second year and 70%Ile third year (for which, under the previous procedures, noPproVal had been given at all).    This new procedure helps then atjnaiised industries directly by enabling them to get on withifiipiemAnting and rolling forward their plans.    It also puts them ina Pos i f --c*on where they can help their supplying industries by drawing up f.m Plans earlier than had been possible hitherto.ne NEDO commented on the presentation of the nationalisedH8tries&apos;figure in statistics of public expenditure, andGovornment has made changes in line withthinking.    Under these new arrangements the investment programmes0f thindustries are still published in Public Expenditure WhitePePs ,3 out it is the estimates of the funds to be providedt, -uUs investment, in the form of loans, Public Dividend CapitalOftSlant oUb? which are included in the public expenditure totals. ThisPreSentation recognises the essential difference between thef        J-isod industries, which finance a great deal of their investment%th -%       ej-r earnings, and the generality of non-trading public services,u      ernment believes that it will also be helpful to the industries7 future occasions it is necessary to involve them in anyaieXercise to reduce the planned level of public expenditure.
Whereas previously any cuts they made had to be in their investmentDrogrammes, in future they will in principle be able as analternative to take any other action which would reduce their requirements for external finance - such as cost savings and,Suhject to counter inflation policies, price&apos; increases. the presentation of those figures in the Public Expenditure white paper shows loans and Public Dividend Capital, on which thelndustries are expected to pay interest and dividends, separatelygrants given for social and regional purposes.fl&apos;om
48.   The NEDO consider that the boards are not effectively requiredto account for their performance in a systematic or objective manner.Thev point our. that there is no external audit mechanism - additional to the present financial audit procedures - which might providereassuranre to Government and Parliament about the effectiveness ofanagement organisation and procedures within the industries. they recommend that the annual report and accounts of each industry shouldln future include a statement of financial and other criteria and ofch.ievement against them.It is the responsibility of each board to monitor performance andc*ency within its industry but the Government agrees that it isalSoessential for the industries to account effectively to Parliamentto the public.    It has, therefore, asked each of them to includeLS annual report a statement summarising and bringing together theVomnient&apos;s main current instructions and guidance, and also inform-n on how it is measuring up to  its objectives.   There may be someOrfnat.ion which an industry cannot publish for reasons of commercialcOr\f jri*aentiality.   But in general the statement would include, forpxe, the main points in the corporate plan and any GovernmentsPonso to them (see paragraph /,/,);    the financial target, and thePanying Parliamentary statement explaining it, including anyrai and social objectives set for the industry (paragraph 73);dsri limit (paragraphs 79-82);    suitable aims in terms of perform-and service (paragraph 78); and any general or specific directions to it (paragraph 20).    In its statement of how well it was11u**ing up to these objectives, the industry would compare its4ai performance against its target and also its progress againstf)Uuiished performance and service aims.    The systematic and h Publication of this information will be an important develop-0fH i.lu response to the NEDO&apos;s report and one which will be helpfula the oeioct Committee on Nationalised Industries, and to Parliameiin examining and monitoring the performance of therj-es,  and of the departments which deal with them.
50. There are aiso a number of other ways in which the industries&apos;activities will come under independent scrutiny.    Under the price commission Act of July 1977, the Price Commission has discretion,subject to Ministerial veto, to investigate most price increases proposed by the nationalised industries.    (The main exceptions arobus and air fares, which are controlled by the Traffic commissioners and by the Civil Aviation Authority, and coal andnost steel products which are subject to European Coal and Steel Community regulations).*f Ministers direct it to do so, the Commission can also examine a nationalised industry which is a monopoly supplier.    Secondly, theGovernment expects the consumer councils to play an important role in monitoring the industries&apos;  responsiveness to the needs of their customers and in making recommendations on the services they give;and a number of ways in which the consumer council arrangements havebeen strengthened are described in paragraphs 30-39.   Thirdly, theGovernment will be prepared on occasion to appoint special committees of enquiry to examine the structure, performance and plans of particular industries where it appears that there is a need for a far rangingreview.   The Government will keep under review the possibility of strengthening arrangements for the external monitoring of those industries w hich enjoy substantial protection from competition.51. The Government also expects the industries to take the initiative in strengthening their own systems for control and monitoring. it therefore welcomes the development of Audit Committees, which theNational Coal Board, the British Steel Corporation and a number ofPrivate sector companies .have recently been introducing, whereby aspecial group, usually including part-time non executive directors,examine and report on annual financial statements, audit arrangements
and internal financial controls. .The Government believes that this isa useful innovation which other nationalised industries may wish toadopt.   it hopes that they will develop further the role of theseAudit Committees, or set up comparable arrangements, to look more generally at questions of efficiency and performance within their^dustry.   The Government also expects that, in the normal exerciseor their management functions, the industries will continue to take.the initiative in calling in management consultants to undertakesPecial studies when necessary.
CONFIDENTIALIII.    THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK&apos;   The nationalised industries are major users of national resources.MCv employ about 1,700,000 people, or 7% of the-country1s total labour^orce.   Their total investment this year and lext is about  3,500i^Uon at 1977 prices, and in 1976 they accounted for 1/,?o of total*ed investment.   A considerable part of their capital requirementsls financed by advances from, or guaranteed by, the Government, andln 1976-77 those represented   about 15% . of the total Publicctor Borrowing Requirement of  8,800 million.   In 1976 theyCOnt*ributed about 10?$ of the total output of the UK economy. They0rninatc four strategic sectors of economic activity:    energy, publict J* *.sPort, communications and iron and steel.   They supply basic^00(*s and services to industry, and essentials of life to individualnsuinQrs.   They are themselves major customers of some of thePital goods industries, and the scale of their purchases means thatIne of these supplying industries are heavily dependent on theirt08ic decisions and investment.    In short, the nationalised^ries have a pervasive influence throughout the economy onstmrtit, employment, industrial costs, and on the cost of living,&quot;nrc of national resources going to them,  and the efficiency withtney use these resources, are matters of major importance.IAs is why the Government has the responsibility to set outthe kOad financial and economic framework with in which they wantCastries to operate.   The consequences of the price restraintPoUcjes of the early 1970s, and tlic
SusPension of financial targets and cconomic pricing policies over aw-ide area, illustrate the dangers of mismanaging this responsibility.0r many nationalised industries this intervention led directly to0unting deficits financed by new and additional public expendituren grants and loans which put other public sector priorities at risk;to indiscriminate subsidies from the taxpayer to the consumers; andln some cases to sharp reductions in investment and employment, affect-lnS both the nationalised industries and their suppliers, when theseNicies had eventually to be reversed.   As a result of this lack ofdipppt-.^lon,  and its consequences, the morale of management and the^-Orkforce in the industries suffered badly.11 is essential that the mistakes of the early 1970s should notboePeated.    The Government intends thatthe nationalised industries willnot00 forced into deficits by restraints on their prices.   When help to be given to poorer members of the community it will be given^riiy through the social service and taxation systems and not bySubsid-lsing nationalised industry prices.
CONFIDENTIALNow that the industries are generally in better shape, public attention - and sometimes criticism - is focussing on the size oftheir profits which result from the progressive return to economicdicing.   However, although these reported profits may appear bigWho. - the neten looked at in isolation thay are by no means large when related to/assets of the industries which are gene rating t hem.   Indeed the realrates of return (that is, after allowing for inflation) being earnedre still generally well below those in the private sector whichn0fnselves have beenvery low in recent years (see the chart on page 67*^appendix I).   An adequate level of nationalised industry profits isSscntia.i to the continuing well being of the industries and theirUstomers and of the economy as a whole.   They provide some of theUr*ds for the very large investment programmes necessary to maintainuPplies and services to the public.   This keeps down the industries&apos;uurrowing requirements, thus helping to reduce the burden ofRationThe Government recognises, however, that it has the responsibilityliving each industry guidance on the financial framework withinL9S sOon11 as possible the process of setting and publishing new financialta^af. -l0n and enabling the Government to maintain other important publicre priorities .56Of^L is expected to operate.

It will be the responsibility-J 0f the industries to achieve the target levels of profits setln this ,t      Q way and, in doing so, to reduce their costs and to continuetoprove their efficiency.    Each financial target will take accountectoral and social- objectives set for that industry. These4Ves will be published.
57.   The following paragraphs explain how tho Government intends^ ^introduce and to reinforce the approach to investment appraisal,Pacing policy and financial targets which was set out in the 1967h&quot;ite Paper.   The main theme is that, in general, if the industriesnot cover the full costs of supplying goods and servicesWMciently, resources may be diverted from more to less worthwhileUs*s.   By using resources in the nationalised industries, the nationforegoes their use in other parts of the economy - that is it incursan &quot;opportunity cost&quot;.    Investment is crucial to growth;    in planningth*ir investment programme therefore the industries should take account of tne cost to the nation of the investment resources theyUse - the &quot;opportunity cost of capital&quot;.   The capital and other sources invested in the nationalised industries should produce3 return to the nation comparable to that which they would haveachioved elsewhere in the economy.   Otherwise there will be a mis-*1:to^uon df resources and they will not make their full contributionthegrowth of national output.
CONFIDENTIAL .Jj.n estinont and the opportunity cost of capi talES&quot;   &apos;ro meet tie objective that the nationalised industries shouldtake into account the cost to the nation of the investment resourcesth(5y use, the Government said in the 1967 White Paper that itexpected them to appraise all important investment projects bysing discounted cash flow   techniques and a Test Discount Rate(TDR) which, since 19 6 9, has stood at )0% in real terms for lowrisk projects.    It also said that pricing and output decisions shouldbo , long runreasonably related to/marginal costs,  including the opportunityCost of the investment resources involved.59 a recent internal review by departments, and the NEDO reportitself9 have shown that the TDR system has not fully lived up toexPectations.    In practice only a limited proportion of investment^as been appraised in this way, because much of the industries1nVestment is regarded as part of an existing system or as necessarynterms of requirements for, say, safety standards or security ofuPply.   ThiS appraisal of individual projects will continue to be^Portant, but so far the TDR has neither provided nor stimulated^e development of an adequate way of relating the cost of capital to th -ne industries  financial objectives.At is important for the reasons explained   above that0Pportunity cost of capital should be brought to bear on theUstries! investment programmes as a whole,   not only    on somend *vAdual projects as at present.   The Government is, therefore,&apos;Ssing with them the development of a more direct way of relatingthe oPportunity cost of capital to their financial performance in0rclor t tLo reinforce the principles of Cmnd 3437.    An this approach,Js explained in more detail in Appendix I, the opportunityCostof capital would be represented by a required rate of return
(RKR) which the industries would be expected to achieve on their newt as a whole.   As such, it would become a factor in pricing policy, the scale of investment,  and in the determination of financialtai&apos;gets.^he Governments judgement is that the nationalised industriesshouid treat the opportunity cost of capital - to be earned on newVestments over their working life - as 5% in real terms before tax.Th *ls judgement is based on a number of factors,  set out in Appendix I,0ut the principal elements are the pre-tax real returns which have^een achieved by private companies and the likely trend in the return on   rv -p,,ivate investment.   The cost of finance to the private sectoras also b..en taken into account along with considerations of social^o Preference.   This figure will be reviewed from time to time -norn*aHy every 3-5 years.The inclusion of the opportunity cost of capital as one of the0rs in determining financial targets would not mean that the targets0uid he set at 5% in accounting terms.   The level of the target will depend on the sectoral and social objectives which may be setan industry and on the earning power of its existing assets. Ifny case a combination of these factors pointed to any relativePriceodjustment, the financial target would allow for this to beso as to avoid sudden disruptive increases, and to take accountCoUnter-inflation policies.^nc financial target will remain the primary expression ofnancial performance which the Government intends the industriesieve, and development of the RRR approach would not involve
CONFIDENTIAL -additional monitoring of the industries by Government.6/,.   Investment appraisal of individual projects will remain important.% is the return on investment which the Government expects theindustries to achieve on their new investment as a whole, and not onlyon projects suitable for individual appraisal.   But it will no longerspecify a general TDR to be used for all appraisals.   The primary responsibility for operating methods of appraisal, designed to achieve% on new investment as a whole, will be with the industries themselvesBut they will consult their sponsor departments on these methodsincluding, for example, the choice of discount rates, and allowance for risk and for appraisal optimism.   For management reasons theymight choose to appraise revenue earning investments at a  rate higherthan 5^o as a means of covering the costs of associated non-revenueinvestment which are also part of the cost of supply.   But whereinvestment decisions arc solely concerned with the choice of the besttechniques for producing a given output, or with issues concerningthe phasing of capital expenditure, the appropriate discount rate would be the opportunity cost of capital rate.65. Industries will Still be required to consult their sponsoringdepartments on certain major investment proposals:    for example, largeindividual projects such as power stations, steelworks, or new aero-space projects.   The Government expects the industries themselves tocontinue to develop methods of monitoring the results of these largerProjects to show that they achieve the expected returns on them, ricing PoJjqv66. A major theme of the-. 196? White Paper was that the nationalised industries should price to cover their long run margina 1 c cave. The&quot;EDO point out that for the most part they have been unable to follow
this principle, not only because of price restraint and adverse market conditions but al so because of serious difficulties of interpreting its practical application in particular cases.   They agree that pricingpolicies and investment appraisal criteria should be designed to leadto the most efficient allocation of resources but stress that theyshould also reflect the particular market and investment environmentof each nationalised industry.67. The Government agrees that for many of t&apos;he industries prices aremarket determined to a considerable extent and in some cases completelyso.   For the industries whose market position gives them scope for setting the prices they charge, the Government sees its main role asdetermining the overall financial target, and hence the general levelof prices charged by t hat industry, in the light of general policyobjectives, including considerations of social, sectoral and counterinflation policy, as well as the need to cover costs including theopportunity costs of capital.68. It agrees with the NEDO that it is not sufficient for theindustries to set the general level of their prices to cover their total costs.   Within the overall level of prices, the industries should pay attention to the structure of prices and its relation tothe structure of costs.   They should ensure that, for example, charges*or peak and off-peak usage are properly related to the relative costs of supply, so   that the provision of capacity is properly related tothe demand for it.   Arbitrary cross subsidisation between differentgroups of consumers, which is one result of intervention in theindustries&apos; pricing policies, should be avoided.   To ensure that this^happening the Government must satisfy itself that the main elements of an industry&apos;s price structure are sensibly related to the
Cost*s of supply and the market situation, and that it has developedne necessary information and accounting systems for this purpose.Object to this, the Government believes that it is primarily foreach nationalised industry to work out the details of its prices*uth regard to its markets and its overall objectives, including itsf&apos; * *lnanciai targets.
 ina69.    Financial targets are central to the guidelines which theindustries expect from the Government, and they are essentialfQr their short to medium term planning.     Appendix H liststhose targets which are already in force.    Targets for the otherindustries will be set as soon as possible.   Generally they willbe for around 3-5 years, although a shorter period may be necessary at first for some of them.jR&apos;    A financial target must obviously be tailored to the circum-stances of the particular industry.    It must also be in a form which can be clearly understood and which will provide an effectivediscipline on the industry.   The main form for the profitableindustries will be a percentage return, before interest, on theaverage net assets employed by the industry.    Alternatively, in one0r two cases,   a profitable industry might be set a target interms of a percentage return onturnover - for example, if it islabour rather than capital intensive.    It may also bo necessaryt aL0 set/short term profits target on an iiterim basis for Aerospaceand Shipbuilding until decisions can be finalised on their longer0rm objectives.   Those surface transport nationalised industries*v*Uch require grant finance, or are running at about break even,be set targets in terms of the amount of deficit or grant.It is sometimes suggested that financial targets should bethe form of self-financing ratios.   However, although forecasts of t.^nese ratios are very important in estimating the industries&quot;uircments for Government finance, they are not a suitable basis0r financial targets.    Performance in relation to a target is asure of how well an industry is using its total assets, and it
is therefore necessary to relate profits earned to the total capital employed in the business rather than to the amount of its investment in a particular year.   Moreover, a number of the industries have a record of shortfall on their estimates of annual investment and so a self-financing ratio target could be met or beaten for reasons inno sense       attributable to efficient management.    *t is, nevertheless,open to the industries themselves to set targets for their ownoperating divisions in this, or any other form, provided that taken together these subtargcts are consistent with the main published target for the industry as a whole.72.   The Government has announced that when an inflation accountingstandard is approved it will apply to the nationalised industries,subject to any necessary adjustments to meet their special circum-stances.   It also intends that, as soon as possible, the financialtargets should be put on some suitable inflation-adjusted basis. the target for telecommunications is effectively set in this way now (andsome of the other industries are also already charging supplementarydepreciation).The basis for the other targets will depend on thepresent accounting practices of the industry in question and also the timing and nature of the general move to inflation accounting.73/    The level of each financial target will be decided industryindustry.    Jt will take account of a wide range of factors. these will include the expected return from effective, cost consciousManagement of existing and new assets;   market prospects;    the scope for improved productivity and e ff iciency;    the opportunity cost ofcapital; the implications for the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement; counter-inflation policy; and social orsectoral objectives for, eg, the energy and transport industries,&quot;hen the target has been
settled for the industry, the Secretary of State willannounce it to Parliament.   He will indicate the ^ffmU^on which it is based:    for example, any particular/objectives which the Government has set the industry, and which may haveafrected the level of the target;    the broad implications forthe industry&apos;s pricing;    and any other important factors ofwhich Parliament and the public should know when they subsequentlyjudgb the industry&apos;s performance against the target.74 .      The NEDO, who also recommended the re-establishment offinancial targets, pointed out that there was not at present any formal procedure for nationalised industries to compare performance&quot;gainst target in their published accounts.   Ttey argued that thisN unsatisfactory from the point of view of encouraging Parliamenl-and public awareness of an industry&apos;s performance as measuredb* this key indicator.In practice a number of the industries havePubUshed such comparisons in the past.   They have now agreed that future all of them will show prominently in their annual ReportsAccounts their financial target and the outturn in terms ofthat target and comment on the comparison.   A target often allows for variations between particular years within a period, and it j?*U be for an industry to explain this where necessary, and alsot0 comment on the prospects for getting back on track for thePepiod as a whole;and on any major measures it proposes to takefor t his purpose.75 -      In this way each nationalised industry will be given publicSuidancc on the overall financial performance expected of it fora &quot;period of years ahead, and it will be held accountable for its performance measured by that target.   For its part, the GovernmentWtl1 be answerable for the level of target which it has agreed*ith the industry, and also for any subsequent intervention which^havc caused the industry to deviate from its target. The
Government has asked the Price Commission, when it investigates priceproposals by an industry, to take account of any financial target whichthe Government has set and to examine to what extent theprice increases proposed aro necessary .to achieve the target or could be reduced bycost savings.Performance indicators76. The NEDO propose that the guidelines to be given to the national-ised industries should include not only financial targets but alsotargets for other aspects of performance.   They point out that by themselves financial targets do not necessarily serve the purpose of stimulating management to further efficiency, since to the extent thatthere is a monopoly situation the targets could be achieved by pricerises or changes in the level of service.77. The Government readily agrees that the Industrie s! performance and efficiency cannot be measured solely in terms of whether they meetthoir financial targets.   Much depends on how they meet them and, while they must price to cover their costs, the Government expects all theindustries to continue to look for ways to improve their productivity80 as to cut and control those costs.   The industries will alsocontinue to let their sponsoring department have performance indicators,including forward projections, which will provide regular and systematicinformation about their success in controlling costs and increasing efficiency.78. So that the public, can be better informed on the industries1Access in doing this, and on their performance and service standards,

The indicators will vary from industry toLpy and the Government recognises that some of the industries inCo*Petitiveposition have to take account of requirements ofCOfn.rneroi itial confidentiality. However, there will probably be someacors common to most including,  for example,  labour productivity,standards of service, where these are readily measurable. The^0verhrnent has asked each industry to start publication of historicrfnance series as soon as they can, and preferably in their nextand Accounts.    There are obvious difficulties for any industry,Hhethennationalised or private sector, in predicting the path of allPerformance indicators in future years; and any industry haskeyboready to respond to circumstances by changing priorities withinverali objectives.     The Government believes, nevertheless, thatthpna 11l0nalised industries should be prepared to make public suit-^leaims in terms of performance and service, and it has askedth,do this in their reports and accounts.&apos;e* to
79,     The Governments White Paper on Cash Limits (Cmnd 6/./0)explained that the estimates of the nationalised industries1external financing requirements, to be met by loans, publicdividend capital and grants, would be used as a form of cashlimit.   This limit applies to the current financial year only,and supplements the medium term financial target.&apos;   These estimates are agreed with the nationalised industries in advance.    Major industries then send to their sponsoringdepartment and to the Treasury every month - and the otherindustries every quarter - an up-to-date estimate of theirfinancing requirements for the year, and their proposals for meeting them.    They discuss with the departments any significantchanges from the forecasts shown in the published table.H As Cmnd 6/,/,0 said, these cash limits cannot be immutable.Tne nationalised industries recognise that this does not mean that they can normally expect an increase in their limit on accountof failures of management or of developments within their owncontrol, including responsibility for the level of their pay settlements.   However, they are different from the generality of Public services in that, like private sector companies, theirrevenues and expenditures depend on trading conditions.   As areforresult, they may on occasion   exceed their borrowing estimatesthechanreasons beyond their own control and which do not reflect onefficiency of their financial management;    for example, a e in the forecast cash flow of an energy industry caused byexceptional winter.   But, whatever the reason, there is no^sumption that if the scrutiny of the monthly financing state-shows an increase in the borrowing requirement the Government

If an increase was agreed it would bcannounced to Parliament by the Minister concerned.82-   The Government sees this control over financing requirements asa Proper discipline on the industries&apos; financial management, and theCastries accept it as such.    It allows departments to keep in close to&quot;ch with developments in the industries&apos; short-ten. financialPOsition but to do so in a systematic and orderly way.   The publica-ti0&quot; of the financing requirements in the form of cash limits is a useful step forward towards the objective of greater public account-*biiity.
CONFIDENTIALCapital Structure? and Sources of Finance83. To the extent that they cannot meet their financing require-ments from their own resources, (profits and depreciation), the nationalised industries rely primarily on loan finance: for theirmedium and long term requirements, from the National Loans Fundor by foreign currency borrowing;    and, for their short termtemporary requirements, from the banks,   In addition, some of them^e also financed by grants;    and some of them by Public DividendCapital, 0&quot; which they pay dividends tothe Government.84. The NEDO consider that the methods of financing theindustries are not based on a consistent rationale.   They argue that the arrangements take inadequate account of risks, that theburden of fixed interest debt can be too onerous in some cases,that the proportion of funding from reserves seems to be based onhistoric accident rather than principle, and that there are noEvincing principles to serve as a basis for the current andfuture use of Public Dividend Capital.85. The Government docs not accept this criticism.   It is truethat the proportion of funding from reserves varies, but thisres&quot;Hs from the very varying financial circumstances and history0f the industries.   As explained in the following paragraphs, thereare longstanding principles for Public Dividend Capital, and theGovernment does not accept that the majority of the nationalisedRetries need &apos;risk capital&apos;.   But it will introduce some^eatelQnal Loans Fund which will be helpful to the industries.r flexibility in the arrangements for borrowing from theHi 0nThe Government reaffirms that Public Dividend Capital will^iLpividond Capital8 6bemade available only to those nationalised industries which are
expected to be both fully viable and also expecially subject tocyclical fluctuations in their returns as a result of theirtrading conditions and the nature of their assets.   Five industries are now statutorily eligible to receive PDC, as well as loanfinance:   Airways, Steel, Giro, Aerospace and Shipbuilding.Apart from Giro, which is in competition in the banking sector, all these industries are operating in highly competitive international markets.    It is rightth*t they should have a capital structure which does not create an annual obligation to pay an unduly Jaijp fixed amount of interestduring the downturn of their trading cycle.   Otherwise theirPolished trading results could well affect their ability to winne*v business in their international markets.   This is not to sayth*t the issue of PDC gives them a soft option.   The Government*would  generally expect that over the period of an industry1s^Usiness cycle, taking the good and bad years together, thera2e level of gross dividend payments   would be at least as&apos;nUchas the interest widen the Government would have receivedif thnoy had advanced the money from the National Loans Fund.^7.      The Government does not intend to take new statutory powersmake pne available to nationalised industries other than thef *1Ve which are now eligible for issues .   It is sometimes**ued that nationalised industries should have PDC, or some formof e .MUity finance, because a private sector company has riskCaPitai -A in its balance sheet.    . But      this argument ignores aaftiontal difference between a nationalised industry and aPrivatt0 sector company.   The latter has to arrange its borrowingso tJat it is not too highly geared.    Its gearing ratio - the
-       - CONFIDENTIALproportion of loan to share capital - will vary according to theriskiness of its activities, but if it does not have a sufficientproportion of share capital it will fail to attract further capital,share or loans.   A nationalised industry in contrast looks to theGovernment for all its external finance which it is given either directly or with the Governments guarantee or agreement.   To obtainthis finance it has to satisfy the Government of the need for it,but this is done by reference to analyses of proposed investment programmes and market and financing prospects, and capital structureas such is irrelevant to the decision.88.   Some nationalised industries would in any event fail the viabilitytest.   It has always been made clear that PDC is not suitable forindustries which have difficulty in breaking even taking one year with another, because it would then become little more than an interestfree non-repayable advance - in effect a grant.   There are otherindustries which are financially much stronger and which no doubt couldPay dividends if they had PDC.    It is true, as NEDO point out, thatthese industries are not free from some degree of risk.   However, itis risk of a different order from that faced by those nationalised industries which operate in international markets, and which are subject to marked cyclical variations in t heir trading, and from private sector companies which could in the last resort go bankrupt.The Government has, therefore, decided that those industries which arenot now eligible for Public Dividend Capital will continue to be financed by loans and, in some cases, grants.    The formal obligationto Pay interest on loans is a discipline on these industries and , inthe absence of    a   stimulus from the stock market to pay dividends,it is the best way of ensuring that they remunerate thefinance with which the Government provides them.rri.\.2i

Loans ...90. * Since 1956 the nationalised industries medium and long termborrowing needs have been met directly by the Government, initiallyby issues from the Consolidated Fund and, since 1968, by loans fromthe National Loans Fund, except when individual industries haveborrowed in foreign currency on the international markets. TheGovernment has reviewed these arrangements and decided that theyshould continue,  as providing the best means, of ensuring that funds are secured for the public sector on the keenest possible terms. Thereasons for this decision are explained in more detail in Appendix III,^hich also discusses foreign currency borrowing by the nationalised industries.91. The Government has also reviewed the terms on which the industriescan borrow from the NLF.   Hitherto the rule has been that an industry should borrow for periods matched to the average lives of the classesQf assets which it is financing.    This ensures that the structure ofits financial obligations is appropriately related to the needs and nature of its activities.    It also preserves a balance between theinterests of the industries and those of the general taxpayer, whohas to bear the residual responsibility for the servicing of Governmentttebt.   Taken overall, the maturity pattern of new public sector debt of allkinds issued during a period is mainly determined by the inter-periods and the needsaction between the preferences of lenders for loans of particular/or the authorities to finance the borrowing requirement in a wayconsistent with monetary policy.   Subject to this, the monetaryauthorities seek to borrow in a way which minimises the total cost0f borrowing by the public sector over time.    It would be neitherPracticable nor consistent with this approach to vary the maturityPattern of borrowing by the NLF to match the preferences of individualPublic sector bodies to which it on lent.   As a result, if the
nationalised industries were free to choose the borrowing terms fromthe NLF most favourable to them (for example, borrowing short whenthey expected rates to fall and long when they expected them to rise)they would be minimising their contribution to the servicing ofGovernment debt, without changing the total debt servicing cost ofthe Government:    their saving would be at the expense of the generaltaxpayer who bears the residual costs.   Nevertheless, the Governmentrecognises that these arrangements may have led to a situation inwhich some industries have a debt structure with temporary and longterm debt but little or no medium term.   T0 meet this point, while still preserving the main features of the present criteria, theindustries will in future be allowed to borrow, if they wish, formedium term maturities up to 20 per cent of their NLF borrowing whichthey would otherwise borrow long term.92.   The Government is also prepared to consider in suitable casesProposals for the capitalisation in an industry&apos;s accounts of theinterest charge over a period (that is, the interest paid on loans to finance specific capital expenditure projects is treated as partof the cost of those projects and written off over their life ratherthan, as is usual practice, charged to revenue in the year in whichthe interest liability accrues).   Capitalisation can be appropriate^hen an industry is financing a major expansion of its capital assets and the new investment will not yield revenue during a long construct-ion period, and the practice is already adopted for certain capitalintensive industries.   But such cases are rare, and in every one theGovernment must first satisfy itself that the  procedure is fully justified, and consistently applied by the industry, and that the^fcure revenues flowing from the asset will be sufficient to cover the total costs including the capitalised interest.
,e NEDO concluded that the evidence which they had accumulatedoverwhelmingly to the need to base the nationalised industries&apos;tintedationship with government on trust, continuity and accountability,three concepts cannot be guaranteed by legislation, by newry &quot;Of control or indeed by principles and objectives discusseda Whto bea White Taper.    Nevertheless, the Government accepts them as aimsachieved, and it believes that the measures and approach nowPr,oPowill produce a lasting improvement in its relations with the^strin*es.    it hopes that Parliament, and the Select Committee onationai--^sed Industries, will find that the proposals - and particular!0r improved accountability - will provide a better basis forheirCOntinuing scrutiny of the nationalised industries and of thets which deal with them.

The ERR approach is directed at the efficient allocation0f resources, although in pursuit of this aim it has to fit invith other policies which nay &quot;be laid down for the nationalised industries.     It is a development of the principles set out*a Cmnd 34-37 (Nationalised Industries:   A Review of EconomicFinancial Objectives) for ensuring that the cost to theNation of the resources used by the industries is adequatelyReflected in the industries investment and pricing policies.Cinnd 34-37 required the setting of financial objectives, whichVould flow from consideration of appropriate investment and pricing^Ucies, and the Government intends that this should continue in a more practical way.      However, the return on investmentls only one factor to be taken into account.

Thegeneral method is to take the revenue requirement, estimated by the methods referred to in paragraphs 4- and 5* said convertthis into a revenue requirement for the industry as a whole.In the case of industries where the output of old and newassets are indistinguishable, total revenue would be deriveddirectly from the price needed to earn the RPR on new investment;   where the price which can be charged for theoutput of old assets is different from that which would becharged for that of new assets, it will be necessary to take account of this in deriving the total revenue figure. Costs,including depreciation, would then be deducted and the resultant net profit would be expressed as a return either on assets* (as valued according to the accounting policies of the day) or some other appropriate base. - - ---^^ figure derived in this way from a common 5% RRR would^ot necessarily be the same for all industries, or evenVery close to 55^.

If the indusrty was operating in stable conditions and without major dis-continuities, there would he a reasonably stable relation-saip between the RRR and the financial target, but this*ay not apply in other cases where investment character-istically takes the form of large and irregular projects,o* where very long term and major restructuring was in^ogress.     Nevertheless, even in these circumstances**e systematic application of a standardised approach to the costs and revenue streams associated with proposedVestment would help in making strategic decisions on it.^ ctical Applicationll-   The calculations involved in the RRR approach vould*** to he made as and when financial targets were determined,op varied.

Determination of the RRR Number13.   If resources are used for investment by the nationalised industries, the nation foregoes their use in other parts of the economy - ie it incurs an opportunity cost.     It should, therefore,seek to ensure that these resources achieve a return comparable tothe benefits which they would have yielded elsewhere.     But therecan &quot;be no unique measure of this opportunity cost:   we cannot,tor instance, say precisely how the resources would have otherwisebeen used, eg for private investment or for consumption.     It is,therefore, necessary to look at the most relevant evidence bearing that mind problems of measurement, and to make a judgement.^.  The TDR was set in 1967 at 8% as being &quot;broadly consistent with the average /pre-tax/ rate of return in real termslooked for on low risk projects in the private sector&quot;.     It was raised to 10% in 1969 partly in response to evidence about thefiPpraisal rates used in the private sector, and partly because of^e pressure on resources following sterling devaluation in 1967*^ as the focus of the RRR is on the return yielded by investment88 a whole rather than on the expected return on individual projects,l* is appropriate to emphasise, as far as private sector profit-is concerned, the evidence on the achieved return months *ei* total investment.^&apos; The main piece of evidence used to determine the RRR, albeit^ified by less tangible factors, was a projection of the pre-taxrate of return on assets achieved by private companies inCeilt; years*.     As the attached chart shows, the rate for-^w5.recognised that accounting ratios are an imperfect basis forflcf        a dcf rate of return, but there is no evidence on achievedurns*     A pre-tax rate is relevant because tax payments areof the return to the nation of investment in the private sector.
APPENDIX 1contd. 8industrial and commercial companies has fallen from over 10% inthe raid-sixties to around 8% in the early seventies.     In thelast three years, it has been very low (around 4-%), but the profitrate achieved in the deepest recession since the thirties is notthe best guide to prospective profits in the next 5-10 years. Itis important to form a realistic view about prospective profit-ability in setting a required return in nationalised industryinvestment.      But exactly what rate should be postulated for thetedium term future must be a matter of judgement.     On the onehand, there has been a downward trend in profitability; realreturns have fallen at a rate of about 1 percentage point everythree years since the TDR was set at 8% in 1967.     On the otherhand, while profitability will undoubtedly improve as the economyrecovers from the recession, the likelihood of continued slowgrovrth in the world economy will mean that private sector profit-ability, outside the North Sea sector, is unlikely to rise very rapidly for some years ahead;   meanwhile, the longer term decline^ well continue.16* The cost of external capital to private firms is anotherrelevant factor;   this has the advantage of being a forwardlooking measure.     There are, however, considerable problems0* measurement and interpretation.     The measure developed bythe Bank of England* has varied between 7 and 12 percent beforeduring the 1960s and early 1970s and is currently estimated to be about 7 percent;   but although the cost of capitalAlined somewhat during the 1960s along with rates of returntrend since then is not clear.      In recent years, however,measure has been affected by the extreme uncertainties*^^financial markets and may not therefore be a reliable guide to^terly Bulletin June 1976 and June 1977*6/,
*0*e settled conditions.(*   Many economists favour a public sector discount rate based011 a measore of social time preference (STP) rather than on con-aerations- of private sector profitability.     This would point to a required rate of return based on STP.     But it would not^o-vide a firm basis because of extreme difficulties in measurement^one of the methods of measuring STP is satisfactory, but what^thods have been used produce figures which, given the downward^end in profitability and the difficulties of estimation, mayHot &quot;KQe significantly different from prospective profit rates.IB&quot;   ^he exact choice of a figure for the RRP must be a matter ofdement in the light of the evidence reviewed above; there8 110 unique &quot;theoretically correct&quot; basis.     However, for thesons given in paragraph 14, the evidence on private sectorFaisal rates is of little relevance.     The notion of sociale Preference does not of itself provide an adequate basis,A0Ugh in normal circumstances it would suggest choosing ae* somewhat below that implied by the rate of profit. It^^e important to take a hard look at the prospective profit-v of investment.     Hence a considerable weight must become evidence on the private sector rates of return actuallyVed in the past and (subject to measurement problems, whichRecently been very acute) to the cost of external capital.ue sector rates of return, allowing for cyclical variations,snown a declining trend of the order of one percentage point7 three years.     But the level of the last few years (about%) Us very low indeed, and it would be right to allow for someej?y from this depressed level.
APPENDIX 1contd. 10^*  For these reasons, the Government has decided that 5% in real terms (ie after allowing for inflation) is the appropriateS^e, in current circumstances, to use as a required rate of*etn ^investment^n/for Nationalised Industries.     It is this rate, rather the rate of interest of loans (usually lower in real terms)v^ich represents the cost of capital to the nation, and whichSfiould therefore influence decisions on investment and pricing.

APPENDIX IIIBORROWING ARRANGEMENTS*   Since 1956 the nationalised industries&apos; medium and long term^rowing needs have been met directly by the Government, except inSo far as they have borrowed in foreign currency on the internationalrnarkets.    As stated in paragraph 90 of the main paper, the Government^as decided that these arrangements should continue, though withSkater flexibility in the terms of borrowing from the NLF. this appendix explains the reasons for this decision, and also the maineatures of the present arrangements.    There is no change in thepresent arrangements for short term borrowing whereby the industrieskQrro\v for periods of less than one year from t he market.&apos;^l0^lng from the National Loans Fund2The experience in the 1950s was that, although nationalised^Ustries&apos;  stocks were traded in virtually as if they were Government^0cks, the period for which the industries could borrow, even whenthe *^ssue was underwritten by the Issue Department of the Bank of*and (in effect an extension of the central government), wasLy shorter than that for which the Government could borrow;^nerauLr,at the yield offered on nationalised industry issues had to bectle higher.   The higher yield was required essentially becausetheSrnalior size of the issues reduced their future marketability.Eventhough the timing of the issues was controlled by the Bank ofEleftantf in rel?L ion to market conditions, the Bank was all too oftento take up the larger part of issues, which it then had to sell*s itdoes Government tap stocks.   The decision was therefore taken toSirnPlirAiy the position and make use directly of the Government s abilittoSecure the keenest terms on new issues.    Thus under present arrangeuio Treasury does the market borrowing and advances loans ash0cesc*sary via the NLF.
3.   The Government considers that to revert to the pre-1956arrangements of allowing the industries direct access to the markets for borrowing other than short term would bring serious disadvantages.   The experience in the 1950s supports the judge-merit that they would generally have to pay a fraction more than would the Government for borrowing for a comparable period.Thus there would be an increase in the costs of servicing thePublic sector debt as a whole.    Moreover, because the industries would bc borrowing with the Government&apos;s guarantee, explicit orimplicit, they would not attract new risk capital but fundsalready destined to be placed in public sector debt;    and sowhatever the period for which they borrowed they would replacea corresponding amount of central government borrowing fromthat section of the market.    This change in the distributionof the burden of public sector debt service would be to the disadvantage of the general taxpayer who, as explained inparagraph 9 1, bears the residual costs.4.   In addition to these increased costs, there would befurther disadvantages in market borrowing.    If the industriesborrowed in the form of stock issues this would complicate the management of the gilt-edged market;    and do so at a timewhen it is very desirable that the Government should financeas much as possible of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirementfrom outside the banking system.    The adoption of targets forthe monetary aggregates has reinforced the   importance of this.If industries borrowed by way of medium term loans from the banks this might in the future affect the capacity of thebanking system to provide medium term finance for exports and
for private industry generally.   This is not a constraint atpresent, but the clearing banks have expressed to Sir HaroldWilson&apos;s Committee, which is reviewing financial institutions,concern that prudential considerations might at some stagelimit their capacity to provide medium term credit.    It seems desirable on industrial policy grounds to avoid the risk ofthis particular form of crowding out by the public sector.5. The interest which the industries pay on their NLF loansis determined by Section 5 of the National Loans Act 19&amp;S.This provides for the rate of interest to be not less thanthat at which the Treasury are, for the time being, able to borrow for a comparable period and on other comparable terms.It is the practice for such loans to be made at ratesdirectly linked to the current yield on Government securities.Borrowing from the NLF does give nationalised industries one form of flexibility which they could not always secure if theyborrowed from the market.    The Government will acceptpremature repayment of the loans which it makes to national-ised industries, subject to an appropriate premium or discountto allow for any changes in interest rates, but not subjectto any penalty.    Such a facility for premature repayment wouldnot be available to a nationalised industry if it borrowedby means of a stock issue, nor would it necessarily beavailable if it borrowed medium term from a bank.Foreign currency borrowing6. It is also possible for the nationalised industries tomeet a part of their requirements by borrowing overseas.However, any decisions about this must be taken in the broader context of the UK&apos;s official external financing needs
for the balance of payments, and the Government thereforemaintains control over the amount and timing of suchborrowing.7. In recent years, there has been substantial borrowingoverseas by the nationalised industries, and this has playedan important role in helping to meet both the borrowingirequirements of the nationalised industries themselves, andthe overall financing needs of the balance of payments. But,with rapidly improving prospects on the current account ofthe balance of payments, and a much improved level of officialreserves, the situation has changed considerably.   The scope for foreign currency borrowing by the nationalised industriesover the next few years will reflect these changed circum-stances.8. Most foreign currency borrowing by nationalised industries is undertaken with a Treasury guarantee.    The Bank of Englandprovide advice about borrowing opportunities in the inter-nutional markets and operate an informal queue whereby pros-pective nationalised industry borrowers can be brought tothe market in an orderly manner as and when suitable borrowingopportunities arise.   The nationalised industries generallycan also borrow from the European Investment Bank and, inaddition, the British Steel Corporation and the national coal Board are eligible for European Coal and Steel Communityloans.9. In addition, industries borrowing foreign currency canchoose   to do so under the Exchange Cover Scheme operatedunder the powers of the Exchange Equalisation Account. This
Scheme relieves them of any exchange risk associated withforeign currency borrowing.    In return, the EEA retains aPart of the interest differential between the rate on the foreign currency loan and the appropriate NLF rate:    the net effect is toreduce the cost of borrowing to the industry by a margin of about1/o below the rate it would normally pay to the NLF.JO.    The financial effect within the UK of foreign currencyborrowing by the industries is very much the same as that oftheir NLF borrowing.    This is particularly so in the case of borrowing under the Exchange Cover Scheme where the foreign currency proceeds are sold as soon as they are received by theindustries to the Exchange Equalisation Account, which makessterling available in return, and which itself in turn has toDe financed by central government borrowing through sales ofSilt edged securities or Treasury Bills.11.    Two special points apply to the British National OilCorporation and British Airways.    BNOC can raise finance without government guarantee because it deals in an internationally tradedcommodity which is customarily priced in dollars, thereby elimination -^ihg any exchange risk on dollar finance.   British Airways borrowabroad, particularly in the United States domestic markets, toChance the purchase of their American manufactured aircraft and0r their other requirements.7A
