COMMON FISHERIES POLICY negotiations note by the Minister or Agriculture, Fisheries and Poodand Secretary of State for scotland. CQM(78)2 was diseusaed by the Committee on 12 January anddescribed the position following the Fisheries Council in december and the prospects for the Council of 16 January.    This note bringsthe position up to date and seeks guidance for further nestings ofthe Council which will begin on 27 January.2. The most Important general point about the last Council was that,despite difficulties, it did not break down.    The BelgianPresidency made a somewhat alarmist public statement but there wasla fact no atmosphere of crisis.     On the other hand there was littleolear progress but the Council meeting was probably a stage which hadto be gone through on the way towards an ultimate settlement. ThePreaeure upon us to settle quickly remains very heavy and will undoubtedly be renewed at the next meeting, which is being put abouta* the meeting at which final decisions will have to be taken.&apos;-  Quotas - turning to the main individual issues CommissionProposals on quotas are   (as we told the Committee on 12 January)a genuine advance on any previous quota proposals and Indeed gotother in our direction than we would have expected even if they^tlll fall somewhat short of our objective.     They were not discussed*t length during the Council but were received with so littleconsent that it appears likely that they oould be agreed. Denmark18 the main sufferer from the Commission^ efforts to meet ourto*ition but there is nevertheless some indication that the Danish*iniater might accept the proposals despite strong opposition fromown industry.    The Presidency pressed us to agree to the quotaProposals but we have always refused to allow individual issues
to be settled until we can see the CFP package as a whole and we did so again on this occasion.   Nevertheless we must recognisethat it may become very difficult to make a major issue out ofsecuring further improvements on quotas - which would inevitably be modest - if everyone else accepted them and we were able tosecure our main objective on other parts of the package.   We would therefore recommend our colleagues to allow us authority to acceptthe Commission quota proposals, subject to such minor improvementsas we can get, if at the same time we could secure a satisfactory settlement on the other issues.   The figures have already been rejected by the industry and there would therefore be some present-ational advantage in seeking some increases, even in the less important species.4. Conservation - this was a disappointing Council as regardsconservation.   At the start of the meeting the Commission producedrevised proposals which were weaker than their earlier proposals &amp;3 important items:   the size of the Norway pout box; increasing ^eminimum mesh size for the main and vitally important white fishspecies; and the carriage of large and small mesh nets on the santfvoyage.   We know that most other Member States dislike strong con-servation measures and that the Commission are lukewarm - as theyhave again proved in their revised proposals.   For the moment ourposition is covered by our general reserve on any single aspectuntil we can see the whole package.   We shall continue to press ioTfirm measures.    Obviously however we shall have to accept some compromise if agreement is to be achieved.   The highly sensitiveissue of national rights to take conservation measures was not di$&apos;cussed, but we will clearly be under heavy pressure at the nextCouncil to accept a very much circumscribed procedure which would substantially reduce our present freedom of action.5. Coastal belts - this was the first Council meeting at whichthe issue of coastal belts began to be seriously discussed. Onthe 12 mile belt our aim of exclusive control after allowing timefor existing historic rights to be brought to an end is not only of real economic importance but in the eyes of the industry is atouchstone of the Government&apos;s determination and success. At
present, the Commission proposals merely provide for the rights ofother members inside 12 miles to be defined and limited. Weargued that they must be terminable.6. On the 12 to 50 mile belt the Commission have so far made noproposals but Commissioner Gundelach did undertake to state how the concept of fishing plans (that is arrangements for limitingfishing effort in defined areas) &quot;might be a vehicle for overcoming the political difficulties with which we are concerned&quot;.   Most member states, and up till now the Commission themselves, remain firmlyopposed to our objective of preferential access between 12 and 50miles although Ireland is of course on our side and we may be ableto get sympathetic neutrality from Italy provided we give her ameasure of support over her worries about fishing off West Africa.In any case while we can be reasonably flexible about how weachieve access preference it is a vital objective and is the best means of achieving some permanence and reality in the quota prefer-ence we now seem likely to obtain.   We have therefore arrangedinformal consultations with the Commission and will be able toreport on these at the meeting of the Committee.   We understandhowever that the Commission are reluctant to take the initiative in tabling proposals at this stage without a firm mandate to do so.conclusion. The CFP negotiation continues to be of the utmost difficulty.The pressure to settle during the week beginning 30 January islikely to be very heavy and we should not rule out the possibilityor the need to make an agreement then.   To some extent the evidentanxiety of the others and especially of Germany to get this issueout of the way may act to our advantage.   We therefore invite theCommittee to agree the following(i)   our reserve on all parts of the package should bemaintained until the whole of it is clear.   The follow-ing points are subject to that.(ii)   We may have discretion to accept the Commissions quotaproposals, subject to some possible improvement.(iii)   We should continue to strive for a better conservationproposal than is now being made but should exercise judge-ment on how far to press this if other items are satisfactory.
(iv)   We should continue to aim at retaining the nationalright to introduce conservation measures but should againhave discretion to accept limitations upon it in the lightof the rest of the prospective package.(v)   We should insist on ultimate exclusive access within 12miles and on an access preference between 12 and 50 milesreflecting a preferential quota position.   While weshould aim to avoid any final breakdowns of negotiationswe should not allow ourselves to be hurried into asettlement and we should not make agreement at the nextCouncil unless these points on access can be achieved.J SB MMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food23 January 1978
