THE CHALLENGE OF NORTH SEA OILINTRODUCTION1. North Sea oil provides a unique opportunity for Britain to improve her economic performance, raise her living standards, move forward to full employment,and develop a socially just free and fair society,2. For too long Britain had a woak &quot;balance of payments, slow productivity growth and low investment.   As a result, our living standards, which wore among thehighest in &quot;western Europe, aro now among the lowest.   Governments have triedrepeatedly without success to alter these trends.   Change will not be easy now,but we shall never have a bettor chance.3. The prolonged world recession focussed attention very sharply on ourproblems.   Following tho fivefold riso in oil prices, and the heavy additional cost of importing oil, Britain borrowed hoavily abroad to finance the balanceof paynents deficit.   In addition we suffered disruptingly rapid inflation. the recession has highlightod tho uncompetitivonoss of some of our major industries,which have required substantial Government assistance.   Plans for increasedsocial oxpenditure had to be scaled down.4. Nevertheless in the past year the country&apos;s position has substantiallyinprovod.   We are no longer borrowing abroad:   and wo are beginning to repaydebt.   ThQ rate of inflation has been dramatically reduced - thanks largely tothe co-operation of tho trades union movemont in a voluntary incomes policy.Unemployment is still unaccoptably high, but the Government has takon action to contain it, and is now in a position whore it should bo able to take furtherneasures positively to reduce it.5. The next task is to build on this stability to move back to growth in production and employment.6. Here it is that North Soa oil gives us a great opportunity.   Sonsibly usedin line with tho policies laid out in this White Paper, it can onable us tore build tho industrial strength of tho nation, to tho benefit not only of thisgeneration, but of our children and our grandchildren.1
7*    But it also presents us with a challenge.   North Sea oil is not a panacea;as a nation we have to decide how best to uso the benefits it brings. ItWould be all too easy for Governments to use the extra revonue sinply to finance^ster growth in living standards through tax reductions and increased socialbenefits to an extent which would loavo insufficient rocn for increasedproductive investment.   But rapidly expanding living standards, with no directovision for stimulating investment, would entail balance of paynonts risksn^ would be unlikely to bo sustainable in the longer-torn;   we would havo donoittle to dovolop now sources of enorgy to replace declining output of North011;   and wo could well find, as the oil starts to run out, that nothing hadPpened to improve our general oconomic performance   The Government believesit would be wrong to fritter away the benefits of North Sea oil in this way.North Sea oil is one clement in what must be a continuing and long-term^ogrannc- for national recovery.   A Labour Government of the 1980s will placen^Ustrial regeneration, and tho rapid return to full employment, at the heartk        a programmo.   Part of the revenues flowing from North Sea oil will bo-ruioliea directly into industrial development by way of direct help and throughthe jjai..^    ational Enterprise Board, and the Scottish and 7/olsh Development Agencies,priority will be given to investment in now energy sources, and in enorgyv&amp;tion.   The Government will introduce a more effective, and more generous,^o of privato sector invostmcnt incentives, both national and regional.Sustained economic oxpansion will not bo possible if the Government1s invest-aQnt atratogy fails.   Equally, however, we recogniso that no programme designed toatii^at .to - ^vestment can succeed unless the macro-economic background is conduciveln^ustrial expansion.   Tho Government will therefore uso part of the benefitsoea oil to reduce taxation on the private sector, and to undertake a pro^rn 9 0^ selective improvements in the public services.   Such an integrated^e should allow tho economy to expand sufficiently rapidly in the 1980sa return to full employment.this &quot;iThito Paper, tho Government sets before the British people its viewlikely size and duration of tho oil revenues, and its priorities for making0 * th(l(^se rovenues.   Tho VThite Paper presents the Governments plan to use ourj$rit [ reGonerate and reinvigorate our economy, and to lay tho foundations for aat onco prosperous and socially just.   The Government, thrcoign its general
economic policies, can sot the &quot;broad framework for such a strategy;   and some ofthe major invostnont decisions - such as the development of alternative sourcescf energy - must, in tho end, bo the Government1 s.   But what the Government can do by itself is strictly limited.   If tho strategy is to succeed, it will requirethe co-operation and effort of management, workers, and tho British people as awhole.   We seek tho support of the whole nation in that task.NOHTH SEA OIL:   A NEff DIMENSION?11. In 1977* North Sea oil production was already equal to about half the UnitedKingdom1 s total consumption;   and the balance of paynents gained by some  2 billion.7/ithout it, the turn-round of 1977 would have been moro difficult, and would havetaken longer.12. We are thus already enjoying the first benofits of North Sea oil.   By 1980,expoct to be producing as much as wo can consume;   and wo can expect to bo anet exportor of oil at least for some part of tho 1980s.   By the late 1980sproduction on present forecasts may begin to decline, and while production should continue at a substantial level for at least another 10 years, we may*ell becono net oil importers again in the 1990s.13. The bonofits which North Soa oil will bring to tho economy can be lookod atin three ways.   If tho real prico of oil remains unchanged, it can be expected:a. to increaso Gross National Product (GNP) by around  3i billion in1980, and by  5 billion in 1985 (at 1976 prices):   this is a temporaryboost to national resources equivalent to botwoon 3 and 5 per cent ofprosont GNP;b. to provide a substantial now sourco of Govornment revonuo: rccoiptswill be small in 1978;   but they will reach  1^ billion in 1979, and bytho mid-1980s they should rise to at least  3^ billion (at 1976 prices):this is equivalont to about 7 per cont of present total Governmentrevenue;c. to improve tho balance of payments by about  5 billion in 1980, rising to  7-8 billion in 1985:   this is equivalent to about /T5 per cent7 of present visiblo and invisible imports.3
14. Thus, North Sea oil can bo expected to provide a relatively snail additionto total national resources, a sizeable adriition to Government revenue, and anajer improvement in tho balance of payments over the next decade. Thereafter,the benefits are likely to decline.   N^t only are the benefits of North Sea oillikely to bo temporary.   Their direct offocts are largely to save foreign exchange and to increase Govornmont revenue.   Of thenselves, they will do nothing toinprovc our economic and industrial performance.GENERAL POLICIES15. The Governments general policies will be designed to create the conditionsin which its plans for tho sensible use of North Sea rovenuos can bost beachieved.16. First, the Government needs to promoto tho oxpansion of economic demand and activity, and got tho oconcmy moving forward to full employment.   This will bonuch easier to do if other major industrial countries take similar expansionaryaction;   and tho Govornmont will continue - as it did in 1977 - to urge on othernajor countries tho nood for offectivo action to bring tho r/orld economy out ofthe present recession.   But, even if tho world economy does not recover rapidly,the United Kingdm can take advantage of its improving economic position to startexpanding tho oconomy through ajopropriate fiscal and monotary policies.17. Second, it is important that, in the procoss of oxpansion, we maintain andinprovo the international competitiveness of our industries. Otherwise we shalllose export markets and suffor increasing import penetration.   An absoluterequirement for such an improvement in our competitiveness is to win tho battleagainst inflation.   Substantial progress has been made in this endeavour over thepast 2 years, but tho battle against price increases must be fought to victory.The gains from controlling inflation, and the threat which renewed inflation wouldpose for tho rost of our objoctivos, aro both so great that this must be anessential part of the Government&apos;s strategy.18. Thirdly, industrial efficiency goes beyond price competitiveness. Thereforetho Government intonds - as it indicated in the &apos;.foito Paper on IndustrialStrategy - to give industry first priority in tho whole range of its policies.4
Tho wider implications of tho industrial strategy for other p^licios are being examined, and the nood for changes in direction or emphasis are being identified.Many of those will need time to take effect, but tho Government proposos to implement thorn progressively and to persist with thorn.19. *,&quot;e will need more and hotter investment (3ee below paragraphs 21 to 25), butinvestment, by itself, will not bo enough:   industrial relations in its widestsonso will need to improve.   The potential benefits of new machinery and moroefficient techniques can only too easily be squandered if tho whole-hearted-operation of these involved is lacking.   Continuity of production, realisticmanning levels, prompt delivery and quality control - these aro crucial inwinning markets and improving production;   unless wo strengthen our manufacturingperformance in these areas, no amount of investment will succeed.   A now approach to industrial relations iB thoreforo required;   one which replaces attitudos of confrontation with democratic participation.   In contemporary society, workersneed to understand tho problons which face tho firm thoy work for and hov; theycan sharo in decisions to inprovo its perfomanco:   for it is tho progrossivoand competitive firm which offers its omployoos tho best prospoct of job security and rising roal wages in tho longer-tom.   For this roason, tho Government willcontinue with its of forts to promote industrial democracy in both tho privato andPublic sectors.THE USE OF NORTH SEA REVENUES TO .*SSIST NATIONAL RECOVERY20, &quot;.,&apos;ithin tho franowork of general policy objectives set out above, the government proposos to utiliso tho rovenues fron tho North Sea in giving spocificcijphasis to a solection of policy areas which it believes aro crucial to thorecovery of tho United Kingdom economy.   Particular emphasis will bo givon to:i. investment in industry;ii. promotion of energy supply and conservation;iii. reducing the burden of taxation;iv. increasing public investment on social and economic infrastructure.5
After full consideration, tho Govornnunt baa docidod that it is not in thonational interost to uso North Sea revenues on a programme of major dobtrepayment - dosigncd, for oxamplo, to clear dubt by any arbitrary da to suchas 1990.   This would almost certainly entail running tho economy at a level of demand which would be incompatible with either a return to full employment, ora major restructuring of British industry.   The Government therefore intends toroll forward a portion of tho united kingdom s international indebtedness forevontual repayment in tho 1990s or booynd.It is now proposod to look at tho four specific uses of North Soa revonuos innoro detail.BVESTHENT IN INDUSTRY21, Substantial increases in investment will bo essential if the strategy isto succeedc   Modernisation and much higher levels of productivity aro ncodod innany firms and industrios if thoy aro to retain and improve their competitiveness.Some firms will bo ablo to cako on moro labour;   others will be producing more,but with a smaller work force.   To raise productivity, and to create new jobs to absorb both tho increaso in the labour force and tho workors moving out ofdeclining sectors will require a quite different scale of industrial investment and expansion of industrial output than wo have soon in tho past 10 years.22. Most investmont decisions have to be taken by industry itself.   At prosont,one reason why investment is low is bocause demand is low.   Industry is uncertain whether new investmont would earn an adequate return.   If industry is to flourishit needs a stable environment.   It also needs confidence in a steadily growingaarkot for its products both at homo and abroad.   And it neods the prospect ofa satisfactory return on its investment.   The gonoral economic climato iscrucial.   To scmo extent, this depends on international factors outside our6
control, but whatevor other countries do, a general stimulus of tho United Kingdomecraony is a precondition for recovery.   North Sea oil will ease tho balanco ofpayments constraints on oxpansion.   \.&quot;o must use this greater frcodom to pursuodonand management pclicios which offer the prospect of steadier growth of demand,at higher levels than would otherwise have boon possible.   In the first stage oftho recovery, such a stimulus will contribute directly to creating a stable andfavourable climate for industrial expansion.   As the recovery proceeds, the^cveranent will need to ensure that resources which, on a longer-term view,should bo devoted to industrial investment and infrastructure, are not pre-emptedty unsustainable increases in consumption - privato or public.23.  Tho experience of the past shows, however, that expanding domand alone isnet enough to bring about a sufficient increase in investment.   So in additionto helping to create this climate of confidence, the Government will need to boinv lvod more diroctly.   Tho North Soa revonues will enable it to provide antffoctivo framework of general investment incentives, both national and regional.&amp;t over and above this there is tho nood for solective assistance and intor-fflntion which, properly-&apos; used, will bo more cost-effective than general^assistance.24,  The tripartite industrial strategy points tho way forward by steadilyGilding up, sector by sector, a dotailod picture of tho opportunities ahead and the action needed to seize them.   There are many areas where United kingdom industry has strengths on which wo can build.   Thero aro now products andfrocesaes to bo developed and exploited.   Industrial activities diroctly related*0 North Soa oil present one example with obvious attractions.   Tho Govornmont*m do cvorything possible to further tho industrial strategy through thoSector &quot;forking parties and to encourage the firms and unions concerned to 300the conclusions of the &quot;Jerking parties aro translated into positivo action the board room and on tho shop floor.   Planning Agreements, liko the^-ustrial strategy at sectoral level, will provide a moans of concerting^Uon by Government and individual firms.7
25. La on integral part of this stmtogy, tho Government itself intends to invest in Britain-s manufacturing future through the National EnterpriseBoard, boti! directly and in partnership with tho privato sector, and through tho Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.    Thoy will have animportant part to play in expanding investoent:   particularly in projects&quot;hich aim to modernise and expand industry in declining areas, to providealternative job opportunities, and to improve tho industrial infrastructure.In all this, tho regional dimension will bo taken fully into account. It&quot;iU bo a major aim of tho Government to ensure that Scotland, -ales and the^gions of England benefit fully from the proposals for modernisation andoxpansion which the industrial strategy is developing.EHERGY26. Two further areas whoro the Government intends to use the oil revenuesto enable more to be done than would otherwise have been the case concerns the production and conservation of onorgy itsolf.27. Tho first is investment in now energy screes to moot tho needs of** economy in tho medium-term and thon to assure our supplios whenNorth Sea oil and gas begin to ran out.    On current forecasts, United KingdomP**ary energy demand is expected to rise from a total of 200m tonnes of oilbivalent in 1975 to perhaps 2V)m tonnes in 1985, to some 330m tonnes by theon* of the century, and to go on rising thereafter.    During this period,Sea oil production is likely to rise to a peak of 100-150m tonnes intho mia^ 1980s, and then to decline to rather less than 100m tonnes by theOno of the century and progressively to decline thereafter.    Very substantial^ostuont, in conventional energy sources - cool, gas, oil and nuclear power -T,ill bo noodod if our supply objoctivos arc to bo not.28-    In addition to those investments in conventional energy, the next two^os will require a growing expenditure both on now and unconventional8o^os of fuel supply and possibly on the conversion of primary fuels (og eoal)iRto more usable foros of energy (eg gas).    At present, work on renewablefoit* of energy - solar, wind, wave, tidal and goothomal power - is in tho0arly feasibility stage and expenditure of funds is comparatively small.8
The Government will give greater priority to these developments.     In duocourse a high level of oxponditurc will be needed in theso areas so thatthe economy can continue to grow in the post-oil era.     The Government baaalready published /will shortly be publishing a Green Paper on Energy Policyvhich outlines /will outlinp7 important possibilities in tho field of energyresearch and development.29.    Directly linked with this is the need for more energy conservation.Previous conservation policies saved us approximately  2,000m over thelast four years:   and now policies announced at the end of last year aim atan annual saving of 10m tons of oil equivalent worth some  700m. Resorvesof sources such as oil, natural gas and coal are finite, and world domand is increasing.     By the end of the century energy could cost two or three times&quot;-hat it costs today.     Further developments of onorgy conservation measures&quot;ill therefore bo an integral part of energy policy, both to reduce costs and to provide mere time to develop and introduco tho technologies that mustultimately replace oxisting fuels.    A further advantage of investment in^ergy conservation is that it has short load times, tends to bo labour-intensive, and in some instances offors very hi i returns.    The Governmentsaim will be to achievo tho maximum savings in energy use which can be economically justified.30.    Invostaont of tho oil revenues in replacement onorgy and conservationl&quot; a way of spreading tho benefits of North Soa oil forward so that futurederations nay enjoy the security of energy supplies which we have today:aae it nay be one of the nost productive ways in whioh they oan be invested.l* is likely to enjoy a high rate of return in its own right.    And by reducingpostponing the need to inport energy, it will both improve tho balanceof Paynonts and increase tho security of our energy supplies.REDUCTIONS*-    A programme of major tax reductions, with no direct provision for anyMansion in the econccy&apos;s productive base, would be likely to increase&quot;ational living standards only temporarily.    We have seen nany tines in thothat a general reflation of donestie denand rapidly results in increased^Ports and a balance of payments deficit.    In the 1980s, with North Sea oil
helping tho balance ef payments by up to  obn a year, it is possible thatwe night b0 ablo to sustain a consumer-led boon for longer than wo havomanaged in the past.    However, we would, in effect, be using our North Seaoil resources to finance a temporary increase in consumption - an increase which would have to be reversed as soon as tho oil revenues start to runout, and which would benefit foreign, rather than domestic, suppliers.32. Tho Government unequivocally rejects this course.    However, therewill bo scope for tax reductions in tho years ahead.    Wo have explainedthat incroasos in investment, and in living standards, must come together.Each onkos possible tho other.    Provided that the investment strategy*oixs, the Government therefore sees scope for continuing to reduce thohurten of personal taxation.    This will not only result in higher economic6^wth, caking possible a return to full employment.     It will also ensurethat the real take-home pay of working people can bo increased withoutinflationary rises in money wngos.^public INVESTIffiNT /JJD PUBLIC SERVICES33. Tho above measures for greater industrial investment, for more energyP^duction and conservation, and for further tax cuts, will substantially&quot;onofit private industry and personal consumption.   There aro those who argue that only tho private sector and personal consumption should benefit fromthe North Soa.    The Government rejects that viow.    In a complex modomindustrial society, both public and private spending havo a part to play,0aeh supplementing the contribution of tho other in our mixed economy. Itia for Government to strike a proper balance between the two, allowing for aS^th in public investment and services commensurate with what tho economy00,1 afford.*-    The Government intends to retain a firm control over public expenditure30 that it remains within the limits set out in the annual Public Expenditure^to ^50^ and does not absorb too high a proportion of tto nation&apos;s^o^os.    However, certain areas of the public sectcr can be identifiod&apos;&apos;hore it WOuld bo in tho national interest to devote some of the North SoaVenues,10
35. The investment plans of tho nationalised industries will need tonatch tho expansion of tho economy: expenditure on essential communications,docks, harbours, etc, must keep paco.36. The problem of our inner citios is also urgent.     The Government hasalready given priority to its plans for rcinvigorating the innor areas ofcertain specified connurbations.     North Sea revenue will onable this programme to bo pursuod with continuing vigour in tho years ahead.     In thesoareas what still remains of tho social fabric of Victorian England - theran-down houses in which many of our immigrant communities live, the hospitals and schools which all sections of tho community dso - is collapsing andnust be renewed.37. ffo shall also need more ambitious training and retraining programmes,both in schools and in further education, to dovolop industrial and commercialsxills in our working population.     Our manpower is our most valuableenduring national resource and during much of the period whon tho oil rovonuosare flowing, the supply of young people to employment will bo falling. two things follow.    Tho preparation of young people for tho world of work mustbe the best we can give them, developing fully their potential talents.Secondly, there will bo tho need and tho opportunity to make it possible forcore men and women to continue their education and training throughout theirworking life.     In all this tho emphasis must bo on quality and rolcvancosince North Sea oil creatos both tho need and the rosourcos in our pcoplo andin tho skills to safoguard our future.38. Finally, as Britain grows more wealthy, it is crucial that our societydocs not forget its disadvantaged - tho old, tho sick, mentally as well asphysically, one-parent families - thoso must not bo neglected.     It is a fundamental part of tho philosophy of tho Labour movement that the undor-privilcgod and disadvantagod have an equal claim on the resources of oursociety.    Tho good fortune of our natural energy inheritance must bo sharodonong all our citizons.11
MONITORING HIOURESS39. This is an ambitious programme but it is fully capable of achiovomcnt.It will, however, take years of determined effort as the Government revenue from North Sea oil builds up from  1-^bn in 1979 to at least  3^-bn in thom.d-1980s and is channelled towards transforming our economic raid industrialperformance, securing our energy position in tho longer-term and improvingour economic and social infrastructure.     Prccisoly because it is a long-tern programme that has to bo set in a wider context, it will need to be implemented flexibly.     This makes it the noro necessary to sot objectives and regularly to monitor progress towards them.     Only in this, way can wocontain tho risk of dissipating tho advantages which North Sea oil can give us.40. Tho Government have considered whether this need to monitor andaccount for tho uso boing made of tho North Sea revenues can best bo done byajans of a special North Soa Oil Fund./&quot;Alternative Paragraphs41A.     It is truo that the establishment of such a Fund would involve anoasuro of artificiality.     It would be difficult precisely to define thedividing line between these activities which wore additional as a result of north Soa oil, and those which would have been financed in any case throughtho medium of the Government1 s ordinary public expenditure programme.42A.    However, the Govornmont believe that other considerations outweighthis.    ?rom a psychological point of view, a Fund would help to concentratetho public mind on the onco-and-for-all nature of our North Sea wealth, and the need to uso it in tho interests of the whole nation.     In particular, woneed to ensure that to the maximum extent posaiblo the use of the oil revenueswill be visible and accountable.    We have therefore docidod to sot up an oil ]?und which will focus public attention on this now source of rovenuo andvtiiich will help to onsuro that tho revenues are not dissipated unwisely. TheGovornmcnt boliofve that both Parliament and the public will welcome thoopportunity which tho fUnd will provide for continuing informed discussion about the distribution of a precious national asset.12
(RiflB,  The main argument put forward for a Fund is that it would avoid thorevenues being dissipatod unwisely and would provide the medium forcontinuod informed discussion about tho distribution of a provious nationalasset.    A Fund in the technical sense would, however, only be practicableif the oil revenues were being devoted to a fow major projects or activities&apos;..&apos;hich would not otherwise have boon undertaken and which were financed3olely or mainly in this way.     Tho Government&apos;s intention is, however, touse the benefits of North Sea oil as one olement in a much wider strategyfcr national recovery.     This means that there weald bo no way of showing&apos;..&apos;ith any conviction what expenditure on, eg industrial invostmcnt, energyresources or infrastructure, was part of tho Government&apos;s ordinary programme and which was additional as a result of North Soa oil.42B.  The Government do not therefore propose to ostablish an Oil Fund assuch.    But it is essential that progress towards the objectives sot cut in this White Paper should be properly and publicly monitored.     Tho Govornmontintend to mako an annual report to Parliament on tho progress made towardsits objoctivos for tho uso of tho North Sea revenues.     This would also allowaccount to bo taken of tho widor benefits which the North Sea will provide in the running of the economy which could not in any cose form part of an oil FundJ?CONCLUSION43. For tho next decades we shall have tho considerable revenues of north Sea oil and fewer balance of payments problems than wo have had sincetho war.    This must not be seen as a temporary breathing space in which to enjoy a standard of living we havo not earnod, but as an opportunioy to securelasting national economic rocovery.     This moans setting clear prioritiesfor the use of North Sea bonofits.44. The Govornmont are confident that the strategy described in this/hito Paper is tho right ono.     Tho Government will set the framework andplay its own part:   wc aro committed to increasing economic activity andemployment.     Better living standards should follow from that and from tho13
Actions which can ho genuinely afforded.    lavement in hoth tho^vato and public sectors is an essential part of tho strategy But^ostnont, whether in nanufneturing industry, in the energy industry^ontial seeial infrastructure - is not enough.    There is a need toand harness tho energies and taients of the British poopic if J^ to aeoure both grater productivity and tho dovolopnont of a socially**&quot; ftoo ^ fair socioty.     It is in that spirit that we should use the?opportunity presented by North Sea oil.^ January i97814
