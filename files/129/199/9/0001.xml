-NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)9 snCOPY NO24 January 1978CABINETSPECIAL EMPLOYMENT measures memorandum by the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster general there are now over 1. 5 million registered unemployed.    But for the1Ir*pact of special employment and training measures this figure could be up4 million higher.    Over the next year labour supply is likely to increasebV 170,000.Against this background the Ministerial Group on Unemploymentrnong Young People (GEN 27) has been considering the need for continuingspecial employment measures when the existing Temporary Employmentubsidy (TES), die Job Release Scheme (JRS) and the Small FirmsmPloyment Subsidy Scheme (SFES) run out at the end of April.    The GroupRaider that special employment measures will continue to be needed andt the right course at present is to build on existing measures though weproposing to consider in addition any suggestions that may be forthcoming.r views and recommendations on continuation of tha existing measures are*e &apos;ollowe.TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY3.TI2S gives employers a subsidy of  20 a week for up to a year for at ^redundant job they retain, with the possibility of a six month supplementDe    ^ a week*      This is by far the largest of the special measures (at mid-It .Cerriber 1977 it covered 186, 000 jobs with a register effect of 133, 000).theS f*So the cheapest, with negligible net costs.    We agreed that it, andrn0cri* month supplement, should continue for another year, subject to anyobi     .cation8 to take account of European Economic Community (e.c.)Actions (see paragraph 7 below).^LL FIRM EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY4.j0k      ^ne SFES currently provides a subsidy of  20 a week for each extraSpe^.rov*ded in manufacturing establishments of less than 50 employees within^^ch1 DeveloPment Areas (SDAs).    About 8, 250 jobs should be supported byCteate About one third of the jobs would not otherwise have beenfifj^    * agreed that the scheme should be extended to manufacturingkirie^     UP to ^00 in Development Areas (DAs) as well as SDAs and also inlty Partnership Areas.    This would create a maximum effect on the
unemployment register in 1979 of 4. 750 at a gross annual cost of  21J^00&quot;Mr  Loth would like the subsidy to be available country-wide which wouldpush up the register effect to 23,000 and the gross cost to  10. million, hewould also like to pay a higher rate in the Development Areas anInneCityAreas.    The Croup thought that Mr   Booth&apos;s recon^sndations should beaccepted economy if there were a significant reduction in the impact of TESresulting fiom e.c. Commission restrictions.JOB RELEASE SCHEME5.        JRS provides a tax free allowance of  26. 50 for up to a. year foremployees within one year of the state pension age who leave Aeir jobs andthe employe, agrees to recruit a replacement from the unemploymentregister.    It is limited to Assisted Areas and currently reduces theunemployment register by about 9, 000 at an annual gross cost of 11.5 million.    The Group agreed that the scheme should apply country-widethat the allowance should be up-rated to about  28- 30. broadly in line*ith parallel social security benefits.    This should have a maximum effecton the register ir 1979 of upwards of  17. 500 at an annual gross cast of 25 million plus     Mr   Booth would like to increase the period of eligibility^ two years andme allowance to  40. tax free.    This would  &quot;&quot;-etbeimpact on the register to 78. 000 and the annual gross cost to  170.0 f^ion.The ma^rity of fhe Group thought  40 too high and noted also mat legislation would be necessary to keep it tax free if paid for a second year Theybought it would inevitably increase the pressure for other benefits to be*ntaxed and that many of the bsneficiaries might also have occupational pensions.    They also thought that it could build up pressure for a lowering* the retirement age generally and would be resented by low-paid workers and by others on social pension and benefits.OVERALL EFFECT AND COST OF MEASURES (See also Annex)J-        Mr Booth&apos;s proposals would increase the employment effects by aboutlQ0. 000. giving a a overall effect on the register of all measures of 360, 000bV March 1979.    This does not mclude any offset in TES to meet the *.ECCommission.    GEN 27&apos;s recommendations would give a figure in excess of283.000 by the sane date, an increase of over 23,000 on present levels,^object to any offsetting savings Mr Bocth can find, the gross costs wouldbe a charge on the Contingency Reserve, amounting, under his proposals to 2?7 million in 1978-79. and under GEN 27 proposals to upwards ef&quot;44 million (the  277 million does not allow for the cost of givingmore underf ES to firms in DAs and Inner City Farmer ship Areas and the  144 milliont0es not allow for any increase cost if the JRS allowance is increases to*2*- 30).    If the present schemes were continued unaltered the comparableCoat would be  127 million.    On Mr Booth1 s proposals his Department***U require an extra 240 staff in addition to 270 already engaged on these8chemes.e.c. COMMISSION,7\       Following complaints from some member states, the Commissionto impose severe restrictions on the continuation of TES in the textiles.clothing and footwear industries, which they regard as distorting2
competition and exporting unemployment.    Without e.c. approval by1 April, payments in respect of applications received after 1 April would beillegal.    We ought to put in our detailed proposals by the end oi this monthas the Commission is entitled to take two months to consider them. views in GEN 27 were divided on whether to take a tough line with the Commission,Yielding no material concessions and accepting that this would probably leadto an adverse decision in the European Court, or whether to attempt to achieve a negotiated settlement.    Under the first approach the conditions*e might be forced eventually to accept could be stiffer than those we mightbe able to negotiate but they would be clearly seen as imposed upon us.The majority of the Group thought that a willingness to negotiate, at least,initially was the right course;  and that it was only realistic to look seriouslyat options which would enable us to phase TES down, such as a short timeforking compensation scheme.    There may be some possibility that negotiations with the Commission on TES would be eased if it was clearthat it would be replaced by a more acceptable scheme.recommendations*        The majority of the Group recommends -a. Continuation of TES and Supplement for a further year(subject to modifications to meet e.c. requirements).b. Extension of JRS to the whole country, on a one-year basis,with an increase in the weekly allowance from  26. 50 to  28- 30at Mr Booth&apos;s discretion.c. Increase in the size of manufacturing firm eligible for SFESto 200 employees and extension of eligibility to Development areas and Inner City Partnership Areas, but that if material reauctionsin TES have to be made, SFES should be available nationally, with higher payments in respect of firms in DAs and Inner CityPartnership Areas.d. An attempt to reach a negotiated settlement with theCommission on TES.e*    GEN 2? should consider proposals for a short time workingcompensation scheme (and any other proposals Ministers mayput forward) as a possible substitute for reductions in TES.S WePartment of Education and Science24 January I978
