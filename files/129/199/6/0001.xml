^UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80CP(78)6 COPY NO24 January 1978CABINETSPECIAL EMPLOYMENT MEASURES 1978-79Memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment the employment prospect this year is gloomy and the labour force18 growing - by 170, 000 a year.    1 hope there will be scope for considerablereflation this year, but this takes time to produce jobs and would rot makeany dramatic impact on unemployment this year.    I have therefore proposed an expansion of our special employment measures which wouldeep another 110, 000 people off the unemployment register - raieing the tctal^npact to around 360, 000.    This would be achieved by continuing theernporary Employment Subsidy (TES) and by expanding the Small FirmsEmPloynient Subsidy (SFES) and the Job Release Scheme (JRS). Thesefleasuj*es would make their full impact over the coming year and are abouten times more cost effective in reducing unemployment than generalreflation.I should have liked to propose action wholly to offset the expectedt 000 increase in the labour force this year, but other measures we haveed at to do this are not as cost effective./p        The Ministerial Group on Unemployment Among Young PeopleN 27) agrees broadly on the need for an increased impact on theegister and on the scale of assistance, but has not yet decided whether thisAd be achieve a by the measures I propose or by other means. Measuresg^eed by the Group to date would take only a further 33, 000 off theto mPlQyment register.    This is too small, particularly when we may have^e a cut in TES.The difference within GEN 27 boils down to the extent of theU^nsion proposed in the SFES and the JRS.    On SFES, we are agreedQ j^   8hould be open to firms with up to 200 employees, but a majority of^sh ^ wish to confine it to assisted areas and inner city areas whereas Iin . to see it extended nationally, with a higher subsidy of  25 being paidelopment areas and inner city partnerships.1
5. On JRS, my colleagues agree that it should be extended nationally,but I wish also to open it to workers within two years (instead of one year)of retirement and to raise the tax free allowance from  26. 50 to  40,which research has shown would be a cost effective way of increasing the impact.    JRS is our only instrument acting on the labour supply and a means of avoiding unfavourable pressures for early retirement.6. The gross annual cost of the package I propose would be 496 million (assuming no cuts In TES) but the net annual cost and effect in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) would be only 118 million.    There would be net staff savings because of reductions inthe unemployment benefit service.7. Even on this basis, it would be desirable to review the situationduring the summer to see whether more could usefully be done, particularly on training for the unemployed.TES AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (e.c.)8. If we want to continue the TES after 31 March 1978, we have to notify the e.c. Commission by 31 January J978 of the form in which we propose to operate the Scheme.    The two months&apos; notice is needed for the Commissionto consult other Member States and to make up its own mind finally about our proposals.9. There are 180, 000 subsidies in payment under the TES of which105,000 are in textiles, clothing and footwear.    (There are additionallysome applications in the pipeline).    The Commission have intimated to usformally that they want changes in the Scheme which would reduce thenumber of textile etc. subsidies in payment by around 85, 000.    In informal discussion Commission officials have indicated that the Commission mightbe prepared at the end of the day to settle for a reduction of 50, 000 in thenumber of textile etc. subsidies.    We have offered no more thanbasically procedural changes in the Scheme ie no reduction in numbers.10. When the matter was discussed by GEN 27 I was asked to makefarther enquiries in Brussels and elsewhere and I will report orally to theCabinet on the result of these.    However, I do not expect any importantchange in the situation I have described.11. Other countries operate employment subsidies of various kinds andin Belgium and the Netherlands there are schemes specifically directed tothe textiles/clothing sectors.    The Commission claim to judge eachscheme on its merits.    In response to an enquiry from the Prime Ministerthere is to the best of our knowledge, no significant scheme of aid inFrance directed specifically to the textile industry.2
12.       Cl early It would be easier for us to make a concession on textiles etcif we could replace the TES for the three industries in question by analternative scheme acceptable to the Commission.    We have looked at thepossibility in conjunction with the Department of Industry and one possibilityhas emerged.    I might be able to devise a special scheme of support for short time working in these industries.    Such a scheme might replace TESwholly or in part in the three industries, though its effect would fallsomewhat short of TES in terms of jobs saved.    I am making detailed proposals to GEN 27.    If they commended themselves they could beintroduced from, say, 1 July 1978.13-       I propose to the Cabinet that we should notify the Commission as required by 31 January that we are looking at alternative schemes to replace the TES wholly or partly in the textiles, clothing and footwear sectors;that meanwhile we propose to extend the TES to 30 June (subject to some small changes, including prior notification of important applications); andthat we will by 30 April present fresh propocals to them designed to meet their concern by reducing the dependence of textiles, clothing and footwearQn the TES.TIMING OF ANNOUNCEMENTU-       There is much to be said for making a general statement of our^contentions at the end of January before we notify our proposals for TES tothe e.c..    (We have also to notify our intention of extending the BITES).This would remove uncertainty about the futare of the schemes, wouldPrecede any leaks from Brussels and could be useful when the national economic Development Council discuss the employment implications ofthe industrial strategy on 1 February.    I attach a draft of such a statement.This would be followed with an announcement in mid-March of the detailedDasi8 on which these schemes would proceed.^ commendations^&apos;       i recommend that:-a. We should aim to build up the impact of the measures towards360, 000 in 1978-79 by extending JRS and SFES to the whole country,with JRS open to those within two years of pension age and with a tax-free allowance of  40 and SFES open to manufacturing firmswith up to 200 employees.b. We should notify our intentions regarding TES to the EECas proposed in paragraph 13.3
c. We should make the attached statement of our intentionsbefore the end of the month, followed by a more detailed statementaround mid-March.A BDePartmeixt of Employment23 January 19784
(confidential)annex draft statementWe have already announced that the new Youth OpportunitiesProgramme to help 16-18 year olds and the Special TemporaryEmployment Programme for adults will be operating throughout1978-79 and that there will be a final round of special training measures for this year before the Manpower services commission&apos;s new training in skills programme comes intooperation.The other special employment measures - the TemporaryEmployment Subsidy,  the Hmall Firms Employment Subsidy andthe Job Release Scheme - reach their closing date forapplications on 31 March 1978.    We have decided that these schemes will be extended in a broadly similar form for afurther year from 1 April 1978 until 31 March 1979. we intend to continue the Temporary Employment Subsidy and to enlarge the coverage and impact of the Small FirmsEmployment Subsidy and Job Release Scheme.    We shall be discussing our proposals for the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy and the Small Firms Employment Subsidy with the eec Commission and I will make a further statement on the detailed basis on which these schemes will operate in1978-79 in due course.The special measures are currently assisting some 330,000workers and are estimated to be reducing the unemploymentregister by 250,000. The extensions of the measures I amannouncing today along with the development, of the other schemes already announced will increase very substantiallyover the coming year the impact on unemployment.
