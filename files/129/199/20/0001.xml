PARAGRAPHS FOR NORTH SEA OIL WHITE PAFER52. The main theme of thifl White Paper ic that North Sea oil provides us with a unique opportunity which must not be frittered away, particularly since the period for which we shall have tide opportunity is a relativelylimited one.    A large part of the new resources and extra revenues must beconscioucl/ identified and allocated to the kind of long-term investment whichwe have not always been able to afford in the past.     They must be used svthat when the oil runs out our industrial base is stronger than it was before.This requires a measure of discipline and a sense of priorities on the part ofthe Government.     We shall resist the temptation tc spend all the additional revenue on short-term advantages.53. The Government therefore intends to make a report to Parliament andto the nation each year to show what progress has been made towards the objectives set out in this White Paper by using the resources of the north sea.     Tills will cover both the wider benefits which North Sea oil willprovide in running the economy and also investment in industry, energy, andthe public services.    In particular it will review the benefits for Scrtland,Wales, Northern Ireland and development areas elsewhere in the UnitedKingdom.     The first of these reports wi&apos;J be published in summer 1979 andwill cover the financial year 1978-79.54. The Government fc*.* carefully considered whether it could go further and set up a separate fund into which part or all of the revenues would bePaid, and from which money would only be used to finance special projects which match these priorities.    At first sight such a fund would have manyattractions since it would seem the clearest way of demonstrating our intentions and ensuring that those revenues could not be diverted to other purpose s.55. After much consideration the Government have concluded that it is not practicable to do things in this way and that if the attempt were made the reverse of what was intended might be the result.     The difference is betweenattempting a prior allocation (which is what a fund implies) and rendering an account of what has been done.A fund would mean providing for a fixed siun from the revenues to be spent in specified priority areas of expenditure separate from theGovernment&apos;s main public expenditure programmes.    In many cases these areas would overlap.    It could result in the Government having one set of priorities for the fund revenues and another for the rest of its programmes:*r it would lead to an undesirably rigid division between those priority areas to be financed from the fund and the rest of public expenditure.    It isimportant that the Government and Parliament should be able to apply its own judgement rf priorities across the whole field of public expenditure andtaxation.    For example, expenditure on assisting investment would not be1
confined to a fond:   squally so it would unbalance priorities for theGovernment to determine the right level  zr a programme in its main public expenditure exercise and then fcr this to be added to frcm a fund.57.        This highlights me problem oi dealing with &quot;additional&quot; expenditure.There is no easy way of identifying what public spending or tax reliefs havebeen made possible by North Sea oil.    It is one thing to say that expenditurein general is higher and the burden of taxation lcwer than it would have beenwithout the oil.     It is quite another tc identify and enumerate in advancespecific items of expenditure, or specific tax reliefs, which the oil will make possible.    Any attempt to bring together such items in a separate fund wouldbe artificial and unconvincing.    Also it would clearly be wrong to make theamount of North Sea revenues determine the amount of spending inparticular areas rather than relative needs.    On the other hand a fundwhere the amount of revenue bad no effect on spending would be an emptypiece of accounting53.        For these reasons, the Government has decided that the right course is to present an annual progress report giving details of the revenuesreceived and of the effect of their application in addition to measuresfinanced in other ways, to further the objectives of this White Paper. TheGovernment believes that this will be mote meaningful than setting up a development fund which would either be largely cosmetic or have the effectof undesirably separating the decisions that will have to be taken.20 February 19782
