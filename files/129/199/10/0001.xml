^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)10 COPY NO 8030 January 1978CABINETECONOMIC OUTLOOK:  CASE FOR REFLATIONAND INCREASE IN PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesaDd the Minister for Social SecurityINTRODUCTION1. We are convinced that there is an *veTOhelming case, on economicand political grounds, for a substantial reflation. A major boost to public expenditure is needed as well as significant tax cuts.Economic background*        Industrial production is stagnant, unemployment is at an unacceptable(and costly) level.    The deflation forced on us by the 1976 sterling crisisha8 been compounded by further unplanned deflation due to massive shortfallto public spending, and although tax reliefs have to some extent compensatedthis the offset has come too late to avoid a fall in aggregate demand anda r*8e in the number of jobless.The Trades Union Congress (TUC) call for a  3 billion budget boostComposed of tax cuts and increased public spending, seems to us to be on^get.case for extra billion pounds of public expenditure4*        Last year we drew Cabinet&apos;s attention to the prospect of a substantialPu&amp;lic expenditure shortfall and it now appears likely that there will bepother large shortfall this year.    An extra billion of spending nextancial year can be presented, at least in part, as designed to offset furtherXcessive shortfall.    It cannot convincingly be argued that it would damagenternational confidence.^        Some forms of public expenditure, for example child benefits, haveg.e 8ame political attractions and broad economic effect as tax cuts. Theyk *e People extra money which they can spend themselves.    And childinf?6^ S0es directly to seven million women who are particularly pressed byation.    .pne womanis vote will be critical at the next election as it hasp      *t earlier elections.    Child benefit is also both presentationally and*ai      Hy an effective way of tackling the problem of incentives to work: it0nl8e8 ^e *n&quot;work incomes of families who might otherwise be better off (ory Marginally worse off) unemployed.
6* Expenditure *n improved public services is not only what peopleexpect of a Labour Government but would be, at the present time, a directform of job creation.    The net cost after allowing for savings in unemploy-nient benefits and extra revenue would be substantially less than the grosscost.    And wo can make sure that the jobs which are created are usefuljobs which will benefit the community.7. For all these reasons we should raise public expenditure programmesby the full amount demanded by the TUC. When we come to spend the moneywe will need to identify those areas where we are likely to be under the most damaging political attack at the time of the election: -a. The level of unemployment will undoubtedly be a sensitiveissue,    and we will need a whole range of measures to improve our record.b. Our record on child support, where we have still to reach the level of provision made under tne Heath Government, is bound to be under strong attack.c. The huge increase in school meal prices budgeted for september 1978 will involve an extra burden of about  1.30 fora family with two children at school.    To go ahead with thisknowing that an autumn election may be forced upon us, wouldbe sheer folly.d. Of all the constraints we have put on public expenditurethose on the health service have in our view led to the most damaging and continuing criticism.CONCLUSIONp&apos;        We therefore invite oui colleagues to agree that:-a. a substantial reflation is needed in the next financial year -of the order of  3 billion in gross terms;b. although tax reliefs should be a main component, theremust also be a package of spending measures for 1978-79amounting to pezhaps  1 billion gross;c. this package should comprise politically attractive measuressuch as cancellation of the school meal price rise, employmentmeasures, a further contribution to relieve National health service pressures, and a November upratmg of child benefit;and2
d.    the cost of the measures should be covered from the contingency Reserve plus, as necessary, an allowance forshortfall and/or such increase in the public sector borrowing requirement as is necessary to ensure that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer has adequate headroom for his Budget.D ES Odepartment of Health and Social Security30 January 19783
