SECOND REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEEON THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERFOR ADMINISTRATIONSESSION 1976-77OBSERVATIONS BY THE GOVERNMENTIntroductory1. In their Second Report for the 1976-77 Session the Select Committeemake a number of comments and recommendations, to which this white paper contains the Governments response.Personnel matters2. In paragraphs 1-3 of their Report, the Select Committee refer again tothe exclusion from the Parliamentary Commissioners jurisdiction of personnelmatters covered by paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 of the Act. The Governmenthas considered carefully the views expressed by the Select Committee, butremains of the view that it would not be appropriate to amend paragraph 10of Schedule 3.3. The Select Committee, while conceding that actual procedures and decisions of the Civil Service Commissioners when considering candidates forCrown appointments, together with purely establishment matters affectingCrown servants, are not appropriate areas for scrutiny by the parliamentary commissioner, express concern about the machinery available for dealing withgrievances elsewhere in the recruitment process and those arising at or afterthe time a Crown servant leaves his employment.4. The Government remains of the opinion, however, that even in suchcases there is no evidence that grievance machinery available to intending,present or former Crown servants is inferior to that available to workersgenerally. So far as the particular areas cited by the Select Committee areconcerned, it is open to anyone who is aggrieved at the way in which an appli-cation for Civil Service employment has been handled to make representationsabout the matter either to the Civil Service Commission or to a recruitingdepartment as appropriate. If the aggrieved person remains dissatisfied he may take the matter up with his Member of Parliament, who, in turn, can refer tothe appropriate Minister for advice. A retired Crown servant dissatisfied withhis superannuation benefits may appeal to the Department in which he was employed, to the Civil Service Department which is the Department responsiblefor the rules of the Scheme, or to the Minister for the Civil Service eitherdirect or via his Member of Parliament. He can call upon the Staff Associationrepresenting the grade in which he retired or the Civil Service Pensioners&apos;Alliance to help him in an appeal.5. It should also be remembered that the tenor of employment legislationnow provides that, as a general rule, the grievances of individual workers,including Crown servants, should be remedied by properly instituted procedures.Against this background, and quite apart from the important consideration that
the Parliamentary Commissioner was not established to deal with relationsbetween the State as employer and its employees, the Government remains ofthe view that the present arrangements do not involve any unfairness to crown servants as compared with other workers.Method of appointment of the Parliamentary Commissioner6. In paragraph 4 of their Report, the Select Committee referred again tothe method of appointment of the Parliamentary Commissioner. The Com-mittec, while expressing their satisfaction with the proposed arrangements for consultation when the post next comes to be filled, have expressed concern thatthese should not preclude at the appropriate time consideration of a formercivil servant; and that the sources of suitable candidates should not be restricted to local government and the nationalised industries.7. The Government remains of the view that it is desirable for successiveholders of the post to bring to it diverse experience of relevant fields of public administration. Local government and the nationalised industries were citedonly as examples of relevant fields of public administration outside the CivilService. The Government does not intend to rule out from considerationanybody with other relevant experience, including experience as a civil servant,but remains of the view that the next appointee should be someone with substantial experience of public administration outside the Civil Service.Delayed claims under the home loss payment provisions in the Land Compen-sation Act 19738. In paragraph 9 of their Report the Select Committee recommend that,to avoid the consequences for the individual of failing through ignorance tomake a timely claim under the home loss payment provisions in the LandCompensation Act 1973, a duty should be placed on local authorities to notifypotential claimants of their rights.9. In evidence to the Committee the Department of the Environmentfndicated that they intended to urge authorities to adopt procedures to notifypotential claimants of their rights individually, and in time to enable them tomake a claim within the six months time limit. Experience of implementing the legislation had already led most authorities to adopt this type of arrangementbut, in the absence of any specific legislative requirement, some had continuedto rely on general publicity of one sort or another. The Departments Circular75/77 issued in July 1977 strongly advised that those authorities who had not so far adopted strict arrangements should now consider doing so, and recom-mended that all authorities should in any event review their arrangements tomake sure they were working effectively and that a policy of individual notify-cation was consistently maintained. The same advice was issued to authoritiesin Wales by the Welsh Office (Welsh Office Circular 101/77).10. The actions of authorities which may give rise to a claim under thehome loss payment provisions and the range of eligible interests involved are such that a duty to notify potential claimants, which would plainly be helpful in general, may give rise to some practical difficulties.   In many cases the
authority would not be in possession of sufficient information to judge whetherthe person displaced was entitled to a home loss payment; failure to notifymight then involve the authority in a breach of statutory duty. There may beno way of completely guaranteeing that everyone is told in time; people maymove house without waiting for the authority to require them to go. Never-theless, so far as this can be done through administrative action, the department and the Welsh Office have by the issue of their circulars taken steps to achievefor the future largely what the Committee recommend. And within thosepractical considerations mentioned the Departments are examining how best togive statutory force to the Commiitee&apos;s fundamental objective at the nextlegislative opportunity.Insurance companies legislation11. In paragraph 13 of their report the Select Committee stress theimportance which they attach to observance of the rules of natural justice in administrative procedures involved in reaching decisions on fitness cases underthe Insurance Companies Act, and welcome the Department of Trade&apos;s decisionto review the case which led to the report at Appendix B of the ParliamentaryCommissioners annual report. The Department shares the Select Committee&apos;views about the importance of observance of the rules of natural justice. it recognises the profound effect of decisions on the individuals concerned andwill continue to seek to ensure that throughout the conduct of such cases full regard is paid to the rules of natural justice and that, notwithstanding thedifficulties recognised by the Parliamentary Commissioner, both the rights ofthe individual concerned and the interests of the policy holders of the company are protected. The review of the case described in the annual report is being conducted by officials who were not concerned in the earlier transactions andwho will prepare a full submission on the case for Ministers.Delay in dealing with tax case12. The Select Committee reported in paragraphs 14-19 their considerationof a case in which there had been serious delays by the Inland Revenue in informing a taxpayers agents of the Revenue view of the tax consequences oftwo deeds that had been submitted; meanwhile liability for tax had beenaccruing on the basis of the Inland Revenue view eventually expressed. TheParliamentary Commissioner had found that there had been maladministrationwhich required a remedy from the Department, but the Department had refusedany remedy. The Select Committee agreed with the Parliamentary Commis-sioner, considered that the appropriate remedy would be remission of part ofthe additional tax incurred and called on the Inland Revenue to provide thatremedy. The Board of Inland Revenue informed the Select Committee on21 September 1977 that they had reviewed the case in the light of the SelectCommittee&apos;s conclusion and had decided that they would grant the full remedysought in the complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner.13. The Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that it would not be appropriate for him to comment on the circumstances of this particular case,which the Board have unreservedly recognised as a most unfortunate case ofmaladministration. But the Report of the Select Committee raises an issue ofgeneral importance touching relations between the taxpayer and the taxadministration.   The Board of Inland Revenue accept, of course, that they are
under a legal duty to raise the appropriate assessment to tax and that in theinterests both of the citizen and of good administration they should endeavourto raise the assessment within a reasonable time. However, the Board take theview that it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to sec to it that any formaldocuments that may affect his tax position are drawn in such terms that theywill secure the tax consequences he intends. The mere submission of docu-ments to the Revenue does noc discharge that responsibility or safeguard thetaxpayers intention. The tax payable can be determined only by whateverturns out to be their true effect. The Board arc concerned to keep delays tothe minimum, but do not accept as a general proposition that delay on the partof the Department in conveying their view of the tax effect of documents canbe made the basis of a claim that the burden on the taxpayer should be diminished.14. The Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that there is substantialforce in the Board&apos;s view as set out above, and that the Board are justified in continuing to maintain it as a general rule.310342   Dd 291045   KI6 2/78
