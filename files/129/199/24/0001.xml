Document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentI 80cp(78) 24 copy no24 February 1978cabinetPUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIESMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. In May 1975, the Cabinet agreed (CC(75) 25th Conclusions) that theywould discuss their public expenditure priorities when the annual public expenditure Survey was being launched.    This year is exceptional, for two reasons.    First, Ministers have already discussed their priorities during their consideration of the draft North Sea Oil White Paper. Second,virtually nothing in the 1978 Survey will affect actual expenditure within the lifetime of the present Parliament.     Ministers may therefore feel thatthere is, on this occasion, less scope than usual for a general discussion of priorities.2. Nevertheless, the launching of the 1978 Survey gives Ministers theopportunity to discuss the kind of policies which they would like to seedeveloped in the medium and longer term, and to ensure that these are taken account of in current planning.    In particular, there may be areas where more detailed analysis by officials would be helpful:   such analysiswould need to be put in hand now, if it is to be available for Ministers inJuly, when decisions will have to be taken.    This paper therefore provides a background against which Ministers can discuss priorities.GENERAL ISSUES3. The plans in the recently published Public Expenditure White paper were based on the assumption that, given the likely growth in the economy,there was room for modest - but only modest - growth in public expenditure as a whole.    Ministers are likely to face similar constraintswhen they come to consider the 1978 Survey in July.4. Faster growth in the longer term may be possible, if the policies setout in the North Sea Oil White Paper succeed.    But if longer-term prioritiesare based on a realistic assessment of the possible growth of resources, itwill be much easier to maintain them without the kind of sharp fluctuationswhich have played havoc with forward planning in recent years.1
GENERAL QUESTIONS5. There are some general issues which Ministers will need to bear inmind in discussing particular blocks of expenditure:-a. There is only a limited room for manoeuvre;  even when public expenditure is growing, changes can normally only be made at the margin.     In addition, some major programmes which are demanddetermined tend to pre-empt a proportion of the available increasewithout any conscious decision to give them priority, which canfurther reduce the scope for reallocation.b. At first sight, it might seem attractive to give priority torestoring past patterns of expenditure;  but current and future needsare changing, and some of the recent ciit6 exercises have themselvesled to a reappraisal of priorities.    It is important to ensure thatpriority is given to the right place, taking account of future not pastneeds.    For example, the &quot;construction programme&quot; has tended todevelop a life of its own, and has been used as a means of expandingor reducing economic activity in a way not always very closely related to the needs of particular services and areas for new building.    And the size and composition of capital programmes, andtheir relation to current expenditure may need re-examination.c. Changes in the size and composition of the population are posingnew problems for public expenditure, particularly for the social services.    The flexibility needed to cope with substantial fluctuations in the numbers in different age groups requires careful planning, sothat the necessary reallocation of resources can be made as part of the  normal programme.d. Recent policies have given local authorities a considerableamount of freedom in setting priorities within their areas.     It is forconsideration whether this process should be taken further, orwhether to do so would impair Ministers&apos; ability to make their ownpriorities stick.PRIORITIES SO FAR6. In considering future priorities Ministers may wish to have in mind the priorities they have given programmes so far.7. The annex to this memorandum shows the way in which selectedprogrammes have changed as a proportion of total expenditure since 1973-74and how they would continue to change following decisions taken in the lastSurvey.    Chart A shows how programmes have grown or are expected to grow.    Chart B shows the degree of change within programmes over each ofthe years 1973-74 to 1981-82.    Chart C shows how expenditure has changedby economic category.
8. These changes reflect a number of major decisions which have beentaken in the last few years:   notably, the indexing of social securitypayments and the net cost of the introduction of child benefit;  increases in the aid programme;  the maintenance, despite cuts, of real growth in the nealthand personal social services programme;   reductions in expenditure on roads and on other environmental services.NOTES ON PARTICULAR PROGRAMMES9. The following paragraphs attempt to highlight some of the problems and questions which affect particular programmes.10. Economic Programmes.    Future demands for the restructuring ofindustries and for support for employment are likely to be heavy. this raises two kinds of questions:-a. There is about  50 million a year in the unallocated provisionfor future industrial support; is this likely to be enough or should itbe increased ?b. Are labour market measures going to need further funds in the medium term?    Will more resources increase their effectiveness?For example, how far and how fast can industrial training absorbmore resources effectively?11. Housing.    The housing programme has recently been reviewed, butMinisters may wish to consider two points.    First, Housing investment programmes are designed to ensure that resources are used to meet the worst needs:   does the increasing emphasis on rehabilitation suggest that new housing starts can be allowed to fall without causing tco much concern?Second, the proportion of housing expenditure going on transfer payments hasbeen increasing while capital spending has been held back.    Is this balancenow right for future years, or does it need reappraisal?12. Education. The planned pattern of expenditure on education needs to reflect demographic change.    Major changes have already been made. But:a. How far does forward planning take account of the need to cater,cost-effectively, for large possible fluctuations in the school population in the 1980s?b. How far will demographic factors make it possible to switchresources from education to other programmes?13. Health and Personal Social Services.    Ministers will be consideringseparately proposals for increases in this programme in the short term.Looking further ahead, they may wish to consider the priority they wish to assign to these programmes, as against other programmes - including social security.    They might also ask:-3
a. Whether the expansion of preventive services could reducedemands on the existing health and personal social servicesprogrammes.b. Whether forward planning - in particular for manpower - takessufficient account of the probable changes in the pattern of demandfor these services, which result from the changing populationstructure.14. Social Security.    Statutory obligations mean that social securitypayments are likely to continue to absorb a proportion of the growth in public expenditure.    The effect of the obligations is that, for mostpayments, each increase provides a higher base for subsequent increases.This constitutes, implicitly, a built-in priority for social security, which ministers need to bear in mind when considering priorities more generally.Ministers are already committed to an increase in child benefit in April1979, and will be examining shortly proposals for an additional increase inNovember 1978.    They may then wish to consider the balance of resourcesgiven to family support through the social security system against that made through other programmes providing services in kind direct to families.15. Defence.    After a period without substantial increases, ministers have given commitments to NATO about future growth.    Plans from 1980-81are subject to review by Ministers.16. Inner Cities.    Ministers have agreed a higher priority for innercities, and have decided that this should be given effect mainly byreallocation of resources within main programmes.    Are they satisfied thatthis reallocation will be effectively achieved and monitored?CONCLUSIONS17. In the light of the above, Ministeis may wish to consider priorities,both between and within programmes.    Possible questions include:-a.      Given that switches in expenditure take time, and that thesustainable rate of growth of total public expenditure will be limited,are there particular areas on which Ministers would like to seeresources concentrated?b. Do Ministers consider that the balance of priorities as betweecash transfers - in particular social security and housing subsidies and expenditure on goods and services is right?c. Are there policy areas which might repay further analysis - elonger-term planning for demographic change, the balance betweencapital and current expenditure, and its relation to the construction industry etc ?4
d.       Does more consideration need to be given to ways of ensuring that the priorities which Ministers set are in fact adhered to? this could be relevant both for the question of whether the present degreeof discretion given to local authorities generally is right;  and, morespecifically, for the inner cities initiative p.Cabinet Office24 February 19755
