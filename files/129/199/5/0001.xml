&quot;MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)5 COPY NO 8024 January 1978CABINETFUTURE PAY POLICYMamarandttin by the chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for employment- Wh-n Cabinet discussed on 22 December the outlook for pay negotiations in the remainder of the current round we were invited to putforward a paper on possible approaches to longer-term policy, includinginstitutional possibilities (CM(77) 41st Conclusions).2- The policies in each of the past three years were presented as temporary expedients to meet the particular circumstances of the time.Their success in meeting their limited objectives - assuming the presentround holds as well as it has done so far - along with our other economic measures enables us now to reconsider our longer-term aims with regardto Pay, where we want to get to over the next few years and how we mightget there, although in the event we may have to settle for an agreement forone year on which we could build later.l&apos;        In this paper we examine the options, starting from the practicalPosition we expect to be in at the end of the current round in July of thisYear.THE CONTEXT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONGER-TERM policy.As we approach the end of the current round the economic position isiy faire.Pay^kely to be racjicaiiy different from that of a year earlier.     With sterlingCUre, commodity prices reasonably stable and the benefit of last year&apos;sjj^^^raint feeding through into prices, the year-on-year Retail Price^  x should have fallen dramatically, perhaps showing signs of levelling out1q     o 8 per cent.    Average earnings will have edged up somewhat over^e^er Cer*t and, depending partly on the extent of self-financing productivityrne S&apos; Perhaps nearer to 15 per cent.    Taking account of the Budgetarys   asures of last November, those already promised for April and the likelybe      *0r *urtner action then, real standards net of tax will for most people8ubstantially higher than a year earlier.
5. On the other hand unemployment is likely to be still aroundH million.    Some commentators will be predicting, particularly if earnings are at the higher end of the expected range, a resurgence of price inflationinto double figures within the following 12 months.    Negotiators, unlessPersuaded otherwise, might seek not only to insure against this but also tosecure in their settlements, ignoring tax benefits, a due share o. the realimprovement that the more buoyant state of the economy would appear tojustify.    Many employees, moreover, may be less conscious of their realgains in absolute terms than of thsir relative losses through compression ofdifferentials, outstanding anomalies ana relativity claims, frustrated plans for restructuring etc about which nothing could be done for two years under*e  6 and 5 per cent policies and less than we originally hoped in the presentWad.    Many might well be unwilling to wait until normal annual settlementdates to rectify these.THE BASIC OBJECTIVES: INCREASED EMPLOYMENT AND HIGHER REALLIVING STANDARDS. REQUIRING MODERATE PAY SETTLEMENTS6- In this situation the Government must clearly emphasise as the objective over the next two or three years and beyond a significant increase to the level of employment as well as improveme nt in the real living standards of those in work, of pensioners and of the community generally.7- A sluggish recovery in world activity and underlying structuralGanges in the industrial economies would make more ambitious manpowerPolicies necessary and may also make it necessary to continue short-termemployment measures longer than we believed.    But on whatever hypothesis*e have the necesrlty of improving our relatively low levels of productivity in many areas and this in turn has much to do with improving investment as**th improving working practices and management.    But that takes time.V-eanwkile it will only make our competitive position worse if moneyCreases in pay substantially exceed the increase in production actuallyachieved;  and the effect of this on confidence will tend to discouragelnvefitment, so compounding the problem.Since the increase in productivity is unlikely to be sustained at moreth&apos;** 2 or 3 per cent per annum over the next few years, this points to a desirable level of settlements of aiound 5 per cent.THE JIRST OPTION FOR PAY:  FREE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING9.We have presented our policies since July 1975 as temporarycj   rruptions in the otherwise natural order of things (though we madereear *rorn the start it would be a matter of years before it could be fully0v8to*ed).    The Trades Union Congress (TUC) last September called by anrwbelming majority for an orderly return to free collective bargaining in*m ^    i.iound, as each group came to its due date under the 12 month
^*        There is a theoretical argument that only free collective bargainingcan determine the just level for pay in a market economy.    Perhaps moreCogfcntly, many of those with practical experience of pay negotiations -whether trade unionists, employers or independent third parties - argue that0nly free collective bargaining can sort out the enormous variety of practical problems of adjustment of pay structures that inevitably arise from time totlrne, quite apart from the effects of the rough justice of an inflexible payPolicy.Yet to leave pay determination to the vagaries of the market place^th no guidance whatever carries great risks in our oconomy.    It isj     Clut to see how one can - for any european length of time - have the advantages ofee collective bargaining if one is not prepared to accept the marketCQnsequences in terms of inflation and unemployment, when bad bargains are8t*&quot;Uck.    There will always be a risk of a high going rate of settlement getting^stablished by bad bargains, because of leapfrogging and ratchet effects.0r 1978-79 this risk could be high, given the level of expectations describedParagraph 5 abeve.     Moreover there is a growing recognition inside theae union movement itself that unless some framework is established whichermines the scope for collective bargaining it will be difficult to meet theneeds of social justice or the nation&apos;s economy.SpEClAL PROBLEMS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR8e&quot;       ^ree collective bargaining raises particular problems in the publicc ctQr*    Traditionally these problems have been met by some form of1^iparison with the levels of pay, or amounts of increase, negotiated in theand^6 8ector (eS pay  Research Unit, the Wilberforce settlement for minersmore recently the forward commitment for firemen).8yst     There are, however, a number of difficulties in operating such aan  em within a general policy of totally free collective bargaining. First,ievelyStem base(* 0x1 &quot;2atch-up&quot; has an element of delay.    Thus when theare   ot&quot; PaY increase in the private sector is escalating, the public sectorinc a^arently condemned to trailing behind;  when it is de-escalating,increa8eS *n       nuklic services will still be reflecting the earlier, highergro   a8es *n the private sector, which may then attempt to recover the &quot;lost&quot;fQr      &apos;    *n 1978-79, in particular, such an approach could mean settlementsto 1lroups settling early in the round, such as local authority manuals, of up*0ok&apos;       cent a* a time when as indicated above the Government would beSeCQln^ to *he private sector for settlements well within single figures.renl n(^y* no index linking or other system of comparisons can entirely^atur      argaining in the public services to meet changes over time in the^ ot&quot; *he work or a local situation.    The private sector comparisonstopt    !lr^0re tend to set a floor with additional increases for some groups on pay      nirdly, public sector pay tends to be fixed by reference to averagearicj he    8 e*sewnere.    Because public service pay levels are nationwide,ause they attract widespread publicity, they appear to be setting the
pace for all private sector groups paid below average.    Yet if these groupsmove up, those paid above the average are likely to seek corresponding increases to maintain their differentials.    All three of these factors tend tocreate a situation in which, even under a system of factual comparisons,public sector pay is often seen to be setting the pace and fuelling inflation.14. The ideas recently put forward by Mr Basnett, General Secretary,General and Municipal Workers Union, presented as they are in the context of free collective bargaining, arc open to these objections.    But hisinitiative is an interesting one.    It could be well worth pursuing on the basisof some view as to the general level of settlements that should prevail ineach current round.    But to avoid unfair discrimination against the public services there would also have to be an indication which applied to negotiations in the private sector.    This forms the basis of the second mainoption.THE SECOND OPTION FOR PAY:  AN INDICATIVE POLICY15. The essential characteristic of an indicative policy is some centralguidance as to the generally desirable level of pay settlements and the inter-val between them; indications might also be given of any general grounds for higher increases (eg productivity or low pay);   some arrangements would be needed for identifying groupa with wholly exceptional claims.    It is m effect&apos;ree collective bargaining within voluntarily accepted constraints consistent with enlightened self-interest.16- The West German system of &quot;concerted action&quot; is, of course,essentially of this kind.    Its effectiveness is enormously dependent on theeconomic circumstances in which it is introduced and operated, asillustrated by experience in the United Kingdom with somewhat similarar*angem-nts.    It is now advocated by the Confederation of British^dustry (CBI)     But it clearly could not work without the positive supportof the TUC (and at least the acquiescence of all the major unions).    Ji thiseould be achieved - and we think it is possible in the longer term if not^mediately - this would in our view probably be the most attractive of alltne options open to us.17- It might help to get such a policy established if the timing of some ofthe major negotiations could be synchronised near to the beginning of thero*nd, so enabling an acceptable &quot;going rate&quot; to be established early on andMinimise the risk of leapfrogging.    We understand that something of thiskind operates through two major settlements in West Germany. Theessential point, however, is that negotiations should be synchronised;Merely to bring settlement dates closer together in breach of the 12 monthrule might be costly and insufficient.    This could be an idea worth exploring**th the TUC generally, and perhaps particularly with public sectorrepresentatives.
INSTITUTIONAL POSSIBILITIES18.        Such a policy would probably require the evolution of variousinstitutional changes.    The indicative statement might conceivably take theform of a joint Government/TUC initiative accepted by the CBI (as in 1974- fSbut in more favourable circumstances).    Or it might be a Government policyendorsed by the TUC and the CBI.     Or it might emerge from sometripartite body, possibly the National Economic Development Council but more likely an ad hoc grouping initially from which some new institutionmight develop.1Q.        There is bound to be considerable difficulty in dealing withexceptional cases.    There is a problem of finding or establishing an institution whose judgmente an to the exceptional nature of such claims would command sufficient acceptance to persuade others to remain content with thelower general level of increase.    It might help if the function were splitbetween purely fact-finding (by a body on the lines of the Civil Service pay research Unit or the Office of Manpower Economics which services theexisting Review Eodies) and adjudication (which might be undertaken by a tripartite or even whollv TUC body).    There is also a problem of case loadbut there might be scope for some of the minor cases to be dealt with, alongmore defined lines, by the Central Arbitration Committee of the AdvisoryConciliation and Arbitration Service which already has somewhat similarfunctions under Schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act and its generalarbitration role.    The chances of such arrangements proving effective areagain depe ndent on the extent to which the TUC would co-operate.20- The question inevitably arises, however, as to what to do if wecannot immediately get a sufficient degree of TUC support to make a purelyindicative policy a viable option, or if, having embarked upon such a policy,it is openly flouted by some significant group or section of the community,fQr example when salaries are individually negotiated or in small firms.Fcr this reason we also need to consider, as a third option, now such aPolicy might be sustained - at least to begin with - by other mears.THE THIRD OPTION FOR PAY: A POLICY BACKED BY DISCRETIONARYpOWERS21- This has much in common with the second option, but requiresmeans to enforce the policy.    It is hard to envisage the successfulContinuation of such a policy beyond the current round without at least the^cit acquiescence of the TUC (sufficient to effectively deny support to any^dividual union taking industrial action against the policy), though suchacquiescence might have to emerge as the policy progressed rather than be8tated in advance.5
Apart from this obvious difficulty a problem with this option is thatthe present kind of discretionary powers can only be applied where thepolicy requirements are reasonably clear-cut.    This makes it difficult toprovide adequate flexibility with the general terms of the policy, and would put considerably greater pressure on the mechanism for dealing withexceptional cases.    This option cannot be regarded as a stable long-termarrangement but might provide a means of transition to option 2.THE next STEPS23. The conclusion of this analysis is that we should seek an indicativepolicy - the second option.    But the prospects depend heavily on the extent and fcrm of TUC co-operation.    The best chance of securing suchco-operation is to include this subject in discussions with the TUC about thewhole range of our economic and social policies.    The next steps must be to explore these matters with the TUC.    The CBI can be brought in later. Theagenda for this part of the discussions with the TUC might progress along thefollowing lines:-a. Assessment of forward economic position, and examination ofTUC ideas as set out in their forthcoming &quot;Economic Review&quot;.b. Assessment of implications of a free-for-all.c      Issues such as the 12 month rule, which might not prove toodifficult to negotiate.d. Approaches to the public sector problem and to the problems of low pay and differentials.e. Can we reach any understanding on the handling of special cases ?f. Can we get a consensus on the general level of settlement and how do we set about it, particularly as regards timing?24Time is short since some indication of the way things might go will beeeded by the time of the Budget, and in o^der to start influencing negotiators-  Potations before the commencement of the union conference season whichmediately follows and runs through to July.Inclusion25-        ur .jt we invite our colleagues views on these somewhat tentative ideas.a ^Sht perhaps be helpful to order our discussion round the suggestedda for talks with the TUC and CBI listed in paragraph 23 above.D &quot;W H23rTSUry Chambers A BJanuary 1973
