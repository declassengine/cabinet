Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(78) 216 January 1978cabinetMEMORANDUM FOR LIAISON COMMITTEE ONEXCHANGE CONTROLNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer at a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategyin December I was invited to put to the Cabinet an information paper onexchange control which could be circulated to the Parliamentary Labour Party/Trades Union Congress Liaison Committee.    I attach a memorandum for thispurpose which is intended to describe briefly why our exchange control regimedeveloped in its present form;  to explain the reasons for the limited changes made recently;  and to outline the arguments which are being advanced for and against further changes in terms which will not unsettle the markets or pre-empt Cabinet discussion by appearing to imply the direction of future government policy.    I should he glad to know if my colleagues agree that thisis a suitable paper for discussion by the Liaison Committee at their meetingon Monday 23 January.    I would propose also to circulate as background tothe Liaison Committee the Treasury Economic Progress Report ofSeptember 1976, containing an article on the economic impact of foreigninvestment, &quot;International Investment and the Balance of Payments&quot;, a copyof which I also attach.COPY NO80D W treasury Chambers*6 January 1973CONFIDENTIAL
UK EXCHANGE CONTROLGeneralThe broad objective of exchange control is to conservethe.UK&apos;s holdings of gold and foreign currency, and to assistthe balance of payments.    Its purpose has been to protectour external position rather than directly to influence the domestic economy.2. Exchange control was first introduced in 1939 under defence Finance Regulations.    It has remained a feature ofthe British economic scene ever since, under the 19^7 exchange control Act, which was amended in minor respects in 1968 and1977.    The Act prohibits a wide range of transactions in gold,foreign currency, and securities, except with Treasury permission,and empowers the Treasury to make orders and give directions.3. The powers under the Act have been used with varyingAgrees of severity, reflecting changing economic needs, duringthe 30 years since 19^7-    Because they have been extended tothe sterling area, and because exchange control has been appliedto the use of sterling in third country trade since 1976, the controls as a whole are still more stringent than at any timein the 1960&apos;s, even after the changes announced in october and December 1977.7.     The administration of the control has been largely delegatedt0 the Bank of England, to be carried out in accordance with the^policy of the Treasury at the time, and the Bank in turn devolvefunctions to authorised banks, and to authorised depositariesin respect of securities.    The aim has to be to enable millions of individual transactions, whether for trade, or investment,0r Personal affairs, to take place with the minimum of friction
consistent with protecting the balance of payments. Thecontrol must rely on the co-operation of those it affects, androust be intelligible and credible, as well as seen to be administered fairly.What the controls are5.     Current payments - ie for imports of goods and services -are generally unrestricted, as they have to be for the freeflow of trade.   But they may be monitored to check that theyare not being used as channels for unauthorised capital movements.    And there are controls which try to secure that money which is due from abroad is made available to the reserves in good time, and that payment for goods and services fromabroad consists only of what is due, and is not made too soon.6-     The control therefore applies mainly to capital transactions(a) UK residents cannot use official exchange to add to the global stock of portfolio investment in foreign currency securities;(b) direct investment overseas, with some exceptions,is not allowed to be financed with officialexchange;(c) a variety of personal transactions is controlledlargely to prevent their use for capital exportswhich would otherwise not have been permitted.7.In addition, the foreign currency required by institutionsn the private sector like banks and insurance companies,SuPplied only in accordance with rules laid down from timeto time.
8.     The purpose of the controls on outward direct investment is to ensure that it is financed in a way which minimises oreliminates the initial cost to the reserves.   The finance canbe found from borrowing in foreign currency or from profitswhich companies are allowed to retain abroad.   Official exchangeis provided only under the so-called &quot;super-criterion&quot; scheme,which ensures that an equivalent amount of foreign exchange isremitted back to the UK within a prescribed short period, andthat there is a continuing return in foreign currency.9-     UK residents cannot buy foreign securities at the expenseof the reserves.    Generally speaking they can obtain them only if another UK resident is prepared to dispose of such securitiesSince the effect of that is a fixed stock, a buyer must beready   to pay a premium - the investment currency premium - to persuade another resident to make a disposal.
Recent changes10.   The improvement in our external accounts in 1977 made it possibleto raake some changes, particularly in areas of exchange control whichwere introduced to meet a crisis and brought short term benefitto the reserves at a cost to the economy as a whole; and in somecontrols on personal transactions which were no longer necessaryto protect our reserves and which affected individuals unfairly.U.   For example, on 26th October, 1977, we made a change to encourageforeign investment in Britain.    Instead of insisting that suchinvestment should be financed in part by bringing in foreign exchange, we permitted all non-resident controlled manufacturingcompanies in the UK (instead of only some, e.g. from the e.c.) to^borrow sterling in the UK for their UK business without restrictiona* to the amount, or to the region in which they were investing.12-   To help our insurance companies and banks to compete for foreignbusiness on equal terms and thus increase our invisible earnings,&quot;e made some relaxation in the rules governing the working balancesv&apos;hich insurance companies, banks, and merchants, could hold inf^eiEn currency instead of sterling, in relation to their foreign currency business.!3-   In addition, certain limits on personal transactions were raisedt0 make some allowance for inflation and depreciation.l&quot;.   Other changes were announced in December to take effect from 1st january 1978 in order to secure the necessary e.c. authorisationsfQr continuing the main structure of our exchange controls; theyWere designed to help our economy by meeting the objectivesAscribed in paragraph 10.   Besides raising the limits for somePersonal transfers within the e.c., we decided:(a)   To lengthen from 18 months to 3 years the period during whichequivalent   foreign exchange must accrue under the&quot;super-criterion&quot; and to increase the limit permitted )erProject from    250,000     to  500,000.      This relaxat:&apos;should help British firms - particularly smaller ones - toHCONFIDENTIAL
to penetrate e.c. markets and thus create more jobs at home;(b)   To end the rule under which 25 per cent of the foreign currency receipts from sales of foreign currency securitiesmust be sold on the financial market.   This arrangement washelpful in times when the reserves were under great pressure.But there is no longer any need to enforce a transferof about  200 million a year from private holdings to the reserves, especially as the rate of return we can earn onthe reserves is not as high as we can earn abroad. UKholders are now free to switch from less profitable to moreprofitable overseas securities without incurring a.   substantial penalty in doing so.    This will add to thetotal of UK assets abroad and increase our future income from them. hg^ future15. Any further changes in exchange control will have to be related not only to the development of the current balanceand the reserves but also to the needs of the economy as a&quot;hole, as determined in particular by the course of the exchange rate and the level of economic growth at which we aim.    It isimportant that the balance of advantage from any changes shouldiie with the UK.16. One issue under current discussion is the effect which theexistence of exchange controls may have on the level of theexchange rate.   Other countries with strong external positionsdo not have major controls against outflows.    It is argued thatthese controls by limiting the supply of sterling in relationto the. demand for it may produce a higher exchange rate - as .in eeis their purpose when sterling is under pressure - and that ifaterling rises beyond a certain point it will reduce ourcompetitiveness and increase unemployment.    A number ofarguments are adduced on the other side - that the impact on theexchange rate is only marginal, that the appreciation of sterlingby reducing inflation will improve our economic performance, thatwe cannot yet be confident that we shall maintain our ci
account surplus through the eighties, and that because the UKeconomy and financial system are exceptionally open such controlsare more necessary here than in some other countries.17. . Another-issue is the effect on outward direct investment on investment and jobs in the UK.    It is argued on the one handthat a high proportion of direct investment overseas is likelyto have a positive net effect on UK exports, and thus to improvenot only the balance of payments but also employment at home.In addition, UK investment overseas will increase the flow ofinvisible earnings and support our economy in the future. Onthe other hand it is argued that investment at home must increasejobs more directly and produce a higher social return than investmentoverseas.18. This raises the question whether withholding official exchange for outward direct investment does in fact produce higher investmentat home.   The 1967/8 Reddaway Report came to the conclusion thatinvestment abroad from 1955 to 196* led to an increase in exports.In conditions of less than full employment this implies some increase in jobs and probably in investment inside the UK.Evidence so far available on the situation today does not throwlight on the extent to which decisions to invest at home oroverseas are, in practice, alternatives, or are conflictingor complementary.    We hope that the work being done in sector^king parties under NEDC as part of the Industrial Strategy will -throv; some further light on this.
No. 78 SEPTEMBER 1976Prepared by the Information Division of the TreasuryInternational investment and thebalance of payments for many years now (here has persisted an undercurrent ofpublic concern about the effect of UK investment overseas onthe balance of payments. Despite the exchange controls atpresent in force, some critics continue to argue that the UKis &quot;exporting capital41 on a massive scale, to the detriment of the official reserves, the balance of payments generally orthe exchange rate, with the result that the Government isforced to run the economy at a lower pressure of demand,and higher level of unemployment, than would otherwise benecessary. In fact, criticisms cn these lines are usually basedon misunderstanding.The net additions to our overseas investments in recentyears have been financed in such a way that the reserveshave been fully protected, and the net effect on the balanceof payments of all the identified items connected with international investment - past and present - has been bothfavourable and massive, averaging some  21 billion a year over the Ja*i three years. Such an outcome is virtuallyguaranteed by our exchange control rules.This article begins by explaining briefly the effects of thepresent exchange control rules. It then shows how a quickreading of the normal balance of payments accounts canlead to misunderstandings. Final!)-, it presents the figures in a new way which brings together all the identified items in the balance of payments accounts relating to inter-national investment.Effect of present exchange controls the authorities do not restrict overseas investment assuch, but they do restrict the ways in which companies canfinance it. The main features of the current rules on direct investment are as follows.i. Companies are allowed to finance only a very small proportion of investment with foreign currency out ofthe official reserves: the only projects which canbe so financed to a limited extent arc those whichmeet the &quot;super-ciitcrion&quot;, that is to say projects which directly promote exports of goods and servicesand will bring benefits to the balance of paymentsequal to the cost of the original investment within aperiod of eighteen months, and continuing thereafter.ii. Other direct investments must be financed in ways which minimise or eliminate the cost to the reserves.In practice, almost all such investment is financed by borrowing foreign currency (either direct from over-scas banks or through UK banks) or out of profitsretained overseas, and in neither case is there any netoutllow across the exchanges.iii. When companies finance their direct investment by foreign currency borrowing this has to be repaid in dueMONTHLY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTThe Treasury&apos;s latest monthly report on theeconomic situation is published on page 5.course. To protect the reserves, the regulations require that the amounts repaid out of official exchange do notexceed the inflows of funds resulting from the invest-ment.iv. The UK controlled subsidiaries and branchesoverseas are required to remit to the UK a largeproportion of their profits. The general rule is that atleast two-thirds of net taxed earnings must be remitted,although detailed arrangements vary with the type of company and host country regulations. The statisticsin balance of payments publications do not appear tobear this out (eg &quot;unrcmitted profits&quot; amount to morethan one-thii d of total direct investment earnings). Hutthis is largely because exchange control applies onlyto companies where voting comrol lies within the uk, whereas the balance of payments statistics in-cludc also figures for earnings of overseas companieswhere the UK interest is a minority; and becauseremittances of rojallies, management fees and certain other earnings count towards the two-thirds requite-ment, while stock appreciation is generally disregardedin calculating earnings. In practice, many UK-controlled companies remit much more than two-thirds of their net earnings.The broad effect of rules (i) - (iii) above is that &quot;new&quot;overseas investment (net) by UK companies cannot cost the reserves a significant amount. Rule (iv), on the otherhand, ensures a substantial and continuing inflow of funds to the UK from our existing overseas investments.As far as portfolio investment overseas is concerned, thistoo is regulated by exchange control and may be under-taken, with permission, in only two ways - cither by foreign currency borrowing as above or through the use of &quot;in-vestment currency&quot;. The investment currency market is primarily a mechanism to enable portfolio investments inforeign currency securities to be transferred among UKresidents. In addition, the requirement to surrender 25 percent of the sale proceeds at the official rather than at the investment currency rale ensures a continuing benefit tothe balance of payments.Sources of misunderstandingDespite the rules just described, the impression remainsquite widespread that wc arc exporting capital on a

The only direct effect on the reserves is the  1,000 of remitted profits, but the accountswill show:massive scale for investment overseas. How docs themisunderstanding arise ?It seems to arise in part from the item in the capital account of the balance of payments called &quot;private invest-mcnt overseas&quot;, which typically carries every&apos; year a verylarge negative entry, or an &quot;outflow&quot; in balance of pay-ments terms. It is often assumed that these &quot;investments&quot;can be compared with investment in machinery, plant and buildings in the UK and that they are diaining away the reserves.In fact, both assumptions are false. &quot;Overseas invest-ment&quot; includes not only fixed investment of the kind just mentioned but also stcckbuilding, stock appreciation andother transactions of a financial nature such as additions to or repayments of working capital, other loans and tradecredit and transactions in securities. On the other hand,the figures are expressed net of disinvestment. It is thusquite wrong to compare &quot;investment&quot; figures in thebalance of payments accounts with &quot;gross domestic fixed capital formation&quot; figures in the national income accounts,which correspond to one of the popular usages of the term&quot;investment&quot;.The second assumption - that the entries under &quot;private investment overseas&quot; show the effect on the reserves of overseas investment - is likewise mistaken. To assess the overall effect on the balance of payments, it is necessary totake account of a number of entries in the balance ofpayments accounts, relating to the financing of overseasoperations - notably borrowing in foreign currency for useoverseas and profits etc retained overseas (or &quot;unremittcd&quot;profits). When this has been done, it can be seen that the statistics confirm that the exchange control rules are indeedfulfilling their intended function of protecting the reserves and promoting a substantial annual inflow of income frompast investments.A hypothetical example simple example may help to illustrate the inter-relationship between the various balance of paymentsentries just mentioned.Let us suppose that an overseas subsidiary remits  1,000of profits to the UK, thus increasing the official reserves bythis amount. The figure of  1,000 will not appear as suchin the summary balance of payments accounts. Instead, thetotul profits earned overseas (say  1,500) will be entered asa credit under &quot;interest, profits and dividends&quot; in thecurrent account and the unremiited element ( 500) willappear as a contra-cntry in the capital account under&quot;private investment overseas&quot;. There are in fact good reasons for presenting the accounts in this way, which follows accepted international practice.Matters become more complicated if in addition the UKparent has borrowed (say)  750 of foreign currency from aUK bank to finance its overseas operations. In that event the &quot;outflow&quot; under &quot;private investment overseas&quot; willappear even larger ( 500 phis  750 equals  1,250),although there will be an offsetting &quot;inflow&quot; of  750elsewhere in the capital account under &quot;foicign currencyCurrent accountPrivate investment overseasForeign currency borrowing by UK banksTOTALC4-1.500-1.250* 750-f 1.000If the reader of the accounts is unaware of the relatedentries under the current account and foreign currencyborrowing by UK banks, it is quite understandable that hemay interpret the  J,250 under private investment over-seas as a &quot;capital outflow&quot; or &quot;export of capital&quot;.The example just described, and the effect on the reserves, can be shown more fully as follows.Current account itemsEarnings of interest, profits, dividends etcof which.-unremittcd profitstherefore: effect on reservesCapital account itemsPrivate investment overseas (net)of which.-financed by unremitted profits and trade creoit**therefore: ether investment to be financedForeign currency borrowing to finance investmenttherefore: effect on reservesOverall effect on the reserves* *assumod to be zero in this example1.5005001.000-1.250-500-7507501.000A new presentationIt might be asked-why not score in the current accountonly remitted profits, and not total profits? There wouldthen be no need for the.negative contra-enlry in the capital account, which apparently causes misunderstanding. Suchan approach, however, would not be consistent with theform of accounting recommended by the IMF and wouldbe open to serious objections. It would misallocate itemsbetween the current and capital accounts and would leadto an understatement of both the invisibles surplus andgross national product.An alternative way of showing more clearly the effect onthe balance of payments of international investment is toleave the main accounts as they are but have an additionaltable on the lines of that used in connection with the example discussed above - a table which brings togetherall the identified items in the balance of payments accountswhich relate to international investment, and shows the combined effect of these items&quot;. Such a table would not, ofcourse, show the total effect of overseas investment on the reserves: for this purpose it would be necessary in additionto estimate the effects of overseas investment on UK trade(a problem tackled in the Reddaway Report), tand pos-sibly to allow for effects on the exchange rate. With thesequalifications, however, a table which brings together all* Table 20 or the CSO&apos;s UK balance of payments 1965-75 (the &quot;PinkBook ) already shows much of this material.,t W. B.

Excluding sterling borrowing from UK banks by overseas companies for investment rn fha UK. which it generally prohibited by Exchange Ccntrot. The amount ofthis borrowing is thought to be small.the relevant identified flows in the accounts ought at least to prevent the misunderstandings which result from un-familiarity with the accounts.The table above has been constructed on these lines and gives figures for the last three years. The upper part ofthe table corresponds closely to the second of the tablesillustrating the hypothetical example discussed earlier. Thefirst section of the table, headed &quot;Current (invisibles)account items&quot;, gives the total earnings on our overseasinvestments and then shows the amounts remitted to the uk (line 6). The second section, headed &quot;Capital accountitems&quot;, shows the net additions to our investments duringthe periods in question and the extent to which theseadditions were financed without call on the official
reserves - from earnings retained overseas, trade creditfrom parcnl companies, foreign currency borrowings etc.The residua! item in line 12 then shows the extent of anyCQst, or benefit, to the reserves. Because investment is calculated net of disinvestment, the overall effect as shown,n this line may actually be favourable. The lower part olfoetobleshows comparable figures lor overseas investment&quot;HhcUK private sector.As can be seen, the table immediately highlights the factlhat if one looks at all the identified balance of paymentstransactions associated with UK private investment ovcr-seas, the net effect on the balance of payments has beenboth favourable and massive- averaging over  1billion ayear in the last three years. Moreover, this benefit to the reserves becomes still larger averaging some  2] billion ayear over the same period when account is taken of overseas investment in the UK private sector. The tablealso brings out clearly how unremitted profits, or profitsretained overseas, contribute to the financing of overseas investment, and in particular how in the last three years thenet additions to our overseas investments have beenfinanced in such a way that the overall effect on the reserves has actually been favourable.
