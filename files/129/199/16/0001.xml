D0CTJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S government cp(78) 166 February 1978COPY NOCABINETBENEFITS OF NORTH SEA OILNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI attach a revised draft of the White Paper on the benefits of North Seaoil.Signed    JOHN hunt cabinet Office6 February 1978
THE CHALLENGE OF NORTH SEA OILNorth Sea oil provides a unique opportunity for Britair to improve her economic performance, raise her living standards, move forward to full employment, and develop as a socially just society.    It will also put her in a stronger position to discharge her international responsibilities, not least inrelation to developing countries.2. Fcr too long, Britain had a weak balance of payments and xtlcwproductivity growth.    This weakness has many and complex origins, but the inadequacy and ineffectiveness of investment in a number of sectors ofUnited Kingdom industry has been a major factor.    The deep world recessionof recent years has added greatly to our longer-term problems. following the fivefold rise in oil prices, and the heavy additional cost of importing oil,Britain borrowed heavily abroad to finance the balance of payments deficit.In addition, we suffered dangerously rapid inflation.    The recession hashighlighted the longstanding uncompetitiveness of some of our majorindustries, which have required substantial Government assistance.3. As a result of this long period of decline, our living standards, whichwere among the highest in Western Europe a quarter of a century ago, arenow among the lowest.    Governments have tried repeatedly to alter theseunfavourable trends.    The present Government, despite a difficult inter-national economic environment, hat   already made real progress in turningthe situation round.4. In the past year the country&apos;s financial position has substantiallyimproved.    Sterling is stronger.    We are no longer borrowing abroad: andwe are beginning to repay debt.    The rate of inflation has beer dramaticallyreduced - thanks to the remarkable efforts of the whole British people andparticularly to the co-operation of the trade union movement in a voluntaryincomes policy.    Unemployment is still unacceptably high in Britain as inother countries:  and it is only the financial support given by the Governmentto a number of firms and industries that has stopped it from beirg much higher.5. The next task is to get production moving and to reduce employment.6. North Sea oil gives ue a great opportunity to achieve this. Sensiblyused in pursuit of the policies laid out in this White Paper, it can enable us tore build the industrial strength of the nation, to the benefit not only of thisgeneration, but of our children and our grandchildren.     To change and improve our national performance now and in the years immediately ahead,even with North Sea oil, will not be eaay;  but we shall never have a better chance.** North Sea oil therefore presemts us with a great challenge.    But it*s not a panacea;  and as a nation we have to decide how best to use thebenefits it brings.    It would be all too easy for Governments to use the extrarevenue simply to finance a quick improvement in living standards throughtax reductions and increased social benefits to an extent which would leave1
insufficient room for increased productive investment.    Such a policy w*uldinvolve cleai and unacceptable dangers.    First, it would entail balance ofpayments risks, making higher living standards difficult to sustain in the longer-term.    Second, we would have done little to develop nuw sources of energy to replace declining output of North Sea oil.    Third, we could weilfind, as the flow of oil starts to slow down, that too little had been done toimprove our industrial efficiency and our general economic performance.8. It would be wrong to fritter away the benefits of North Sea oil in thisway.    It will be recalled that a useful balance of payments surplus was built up in 1969-70;  but this was rapidly dissipated in a short-lived consumerboom in the early seventies leaving no permanent improvement in our economy.    It would be a tragedy for the nation if such irresponsible wastewere to be repeated in relation to North Sea oil.9. Oil is one element in what must be a continuing and long-term pro-gramme for national recovery.    The Labour Government will place industrialdegeneration, and a permanent return to full employment, at the heart of this programme.    Part of the revenues flowing from Norxh Sea oil will bechannelled into industrial development by way of an effective framework ofnational and regional investment incentives;  by direct selective assistance;and through the National Enterprise Board and the Scottish, Welsh andHorthern Ireland Development Agencies.    High priority will also be given toencouraging research and development in*o new projects and processes, andto investment in new energy sources and in energy conservation.10. Sustained economic growth, and a return to full employment, wouldnot be possible if our investment strategy were to fail.    Equally, however,we recognise that no programme designed to stimulate investment cansucceed unless the economic background encourages industrial expansion.Higher growth and higher investment must go hand in hand.   Each willstimulate the other - and the economic benefits of a soundly-basede*expansion will enable the Government to reduce taxation on the private sector, and undertake a programme of selective improvements in the public services.*1.       In this White Paper, the Government sets before the British people*ts view of the likely size and duration of the oil revenues, and its ownpriorities for making use of those revenues in order to regenerate the economy and build a prosperous and just society.    But what the government can do by itself is strictly limited.    If the strategy is to succeed, it willrequire the co-operation and effort of management, workers and theBritish people as a whole.    We seek the support of the whole nation in thattask.2
NORTH SEA OIL:  A NEW DIMENSION12. In 1977, North Sea oil production was already equal to cbout half theUnited kingdom s total consumption;  and the balance of payments gained bysome  2 billion.    Without it, the financial turn-round of 1977 would havebeen more difficult, and would have taken longer.    By 1980, we expect to beproducing as much oil as we will consume;  and we can expect to be a netexporter of oil at least for some part of the 1980s.13. The first benefits of North Sea oil have thus begun to flow and theLabour Government has already taken steps to safeguard the national interest in this important resource.    The British National Oil Corporation(BNOC) was oet up in 1976 to hold the Government&apos;s interests in commercialfields and new licences, and so far participation agreements have beanreached with 42 oil companies.    BNOC will also be able to undertakeexploration and production on it3 own once it has acquired the necessarypersonnel and expertise.    These measures will reinfcrce the Government1 power to control the pace of development, both in securing development ofthe marginal fields and in operating a wise depletion policy.    We have alsointroduced  the Petroleum Revenue Tax which, with a royalty charge andCorporation Tax, should bring X per cent of net revenues to the UnitedKingdom Exchequer and therefore available to tne nation for the attainment of wider economic objectives.14. How much is North Sea oil likely to be worth?    We can look at thebenefit in three different ways - the increase in the national income, theincrease in Government revenue, and the improvement to the balance ofpayments.    Assuming that the real price of oil remains unchanged, andvaluing the benefits at 1977 price s:-a. It will increase our national income, the Gross national product.    The United Kingdom income arising directly from oil production in the North Sea is expected by 1980 to be about 4 billion (at 1977 prices) or rather more than 3 per cent of present GNP.    By the mid-1980s, this direct contribution shouldrise to about  6 billion a year.b. It will contribute to Government Revenue,    To start with,receipts will be small, because development costs will be set againstprofits.    But later on they will become quite a substantial source ofrevenue.    Estimates for the mid-1980s (referring to both oil and gasproduction) suggest a total yield *f about  4 bill?on (at 1977 prices).c. It will help the Balance of Payments.    Just how large this benefit will be depends very much on the use we make of the opportunities itcreates.    Estimates of the potential gain have been made on theassumption that neither the exchange rate nor the level of domesticactivity is affected.    On those assumptions the total balance ofpayments will be better than it would otherwise have been by about 5^ billion in 1980 (at 1977 prices) and about  8 billion or  9 billionin the mid-1980s.3
15. We must keep these gains in perspective.    As these figures show,North Sea oil represents only a relatively small addition to our total national resources, but it adds substantially to Government revenue, and it is a majorhelp to our balance of payments.    These benefits will be at their height for adecade or so;  thereafter, they are likely to decline and we may become netoil importers again in the 1990s.    So the question is how we nae this ouce-and-for-all opportunity to build on the policies which the Government is alreadypursuing to strengthen the British economy fundamentally.16. North Sea oil has, in fact, already created direct industrial benefits in the oil and oil-related industries.    Through the Offshore Supplies Office(OSO) the Government is actively encouraging United Kingdom industry toobtain an increasing share in important technological areas such as pumpingand power generation equipment, hydrographio and soil testing, and theMaintenance of offshore installations.    As a result of these efforts and the enterprise of many British firms, United Kingdom industry&apos;s share oi thetotal domestic offshore supplies market rose from 40 per cent in 1974 to57 per cent in 1976.    In employment terms, this market was responsible for over 100, 000 jobs in 1977, a large proportion of them in Scotland and theNorth of England.    Although employment has new passed its peak and isexpected inevitably to decline, further jobs will be created in the production,drilling, inspection, maintenance and repair phases of oil field development.Still more important, however, are the indirect effects. BecauseNorth Sea oil will greatly reduce our import bill, the balance of paymentsconstraints on expanding the British economy will be much relaxed.    As aresult, the prospects of steady, sustainable growth are greatly improved.What we need are the right policies for industrial investment, so as to use this opportunity for expansion to bring about a permanent improvement inQur economic efficiency.THE OVERALL FRAMEWORKThe Governments general policies will be designed to create theconditions in which its plans for the sensible use of North Sea revenues can best be achieved.^9.       First, the Government aims to promote the expansion of economic^emand and activity, and get the economy moving forward to fidl employment.This will be much easier to do if other major industrial, countries take similar expansionary action;  and the Government will continue - as it did in*977 - to urge on other major countries the need for effective action to bringthe world economy out of the present recession.    But, even if the world economy does not recover rapidly, the United Kingdom can take advantage *fimproving economic position to start expanding the economy throughaPpropriate fiscal and monetary policies.    In doing this the Government will^Q everything it can to manage the balance of payments and the phasing of debtrepayment so as to ensure that the exchange rate   leaves industry competitiveln terms of price and is compatible with the aim of returning to full employ-^ent.
20. second \, it is important that, i&quot;i the process of expansion, we maintain and improve the international competitiveness of our industries. Otherwisewe shall lose export markets and suffer increasing import penetration. Acrucial requirement for such an improvement in our competitiveness is toretain the upper hand in the battle against inflation:  prices and incomes mustttot again accelerate out of control.    Furthermore, with the flow of oilbenefiting the balance of payments by  Y billion a year, the market rate forsterling may be stronger than would otherwise be justified by the underlyingcompetitive position of United Kingdom industry.    It may therefore sometimesbe difficult to manage the exchange rate ao as to offset any deterioration inthat competitive position.    Consequently, it will be even more vital than before to attack the problem of competitiveness at its roots. TheGovernment1 s emphasis on the United kingdom s industrial performance -keeping down the costs of production - is intended tu do this.21. Third, industrial efficiency goes beyond price competitiveness. Thisis why the Government intends - as it indicated in the White Paper on industrial Strategy - to give industry first priority in the whole range of itspolicies.    The wider implications of the industrial strategy for other policiesare being examined, and the need for changes in direction or emphasis arebeing identified.    Many of these will need time to take effect, but theGovernment will pursue them vigorously.22. Fourth, a new approach to industrial relations will also be required:Qne which replaces attitudes of confrontation with democratic participation.In contemporary society, workers need to understand the problems whichface the firms for which they work and to share in decisions to improveperformance.    Certainly Britain needs more and better investment;  but the potential benefits of new machinery and more efficient techniques may neverke realised if the whole-hearted co-operatior of those involved is lacking.For this reason, the Government will continue with its efforts to promoteindustrial democracy in both the private and public sectors.    Without the active and sustained co-operation of the woikforce, it will be impossible to achieve continuity of production, realistic manning levels, prompt deliveryand quality control.    These factors are. crucial in winning markets and improving production;  and unless we strengthen these aspects of ourManufacturing performance, no amount of investment will be enough.^3.       Fifth, the Government aims to provide as much stability as possibleil its economic policies and measures.    Sudden changes in policy discouragelr*dustry from branching out into new fields, and the greater freedom broughtW North Sea oil can be used to avoid such lurches in policy,.THE USE OF NORTH SEA RE&quot;\E NUES TO ASSIST NATIONAL RECOVERY^*       We could use the temporary bonus of North Sea oil to go on a nationalspending spree, awarding ourselves increases in private and public consump-kon, which would last only for the duration of the oil flow.    But when the oilrevenues began to decline, the economy would then be left with an extremely^pleasant period of adjustment to lower living standards.    We would have^ene virtually nothing to prepare ourselves for the time when we will not have^c revenues and may need to import energy once more.5
25. The nation must not allow the benefits of North Sea oil to be misusedin this way.    Instead, we should aim to convert the sliort-term benefits of north Sea oil into a permanent improvement in our economic and industrial efficiency, and consequently in our national standard of living. Bychannelling part of our oil resources into industrial investment, into produc-*.ive capacity, both public and private, and into essential infra-structure,strengthening British industry tnrough new investment and additional capacity,and by modernising our essential public services, the Government strategywill help to increase the United kingdom s economic strength both while the oil is flowing and after it runs out.    By devoting resources to energyconservation, and to the expansion of alternative energy sources (bothconventional and new), the Government strategy will help to save foreign currency and to reduce our reliance on imported energy when our own oil isexhausted.    By cutting taxation, the Government strategy will improve the incentive to work, and will help to ensure that the potential improvements inour growth rate, made possible by higher investment, will in fact berealised.    Such an improvement in our national performance   will provideextra resources to improve our public services.26. The Government believes that it must be a deliberate and statedobjective to make direct use of our oil resources to improve our industrialperformance, so that the nation can enjoy the indirect benefits of oil - highergrowth, and more public and private consumption - for many years after the oil supply itself is exhausted,INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRY27. Substantial increases in investment will be essential if the strategy isto succeed.   Despito some major successes there are still too many examples of poorly planned and inefficiently employed investment which have keptUnited Kingdom productivity and profitability far below that of our maincompetitors.    Modernisation and much higher levels of productivity are needed in many firms and industries.    Some firms will be able to take on more labour;  others will be producing more but with a smaller workforce;elsewhere, workers will be moving out of declining sectors.   To raiseProductivity and to create new jobs will require a quite different scale andniuch higher quality of industrial investment and output than we have seensince the war in a number of industries.^*       At present, one reason why investment is low is because demand isIndustry is uncertain whether new investment would earn an adequateReturn.    If industry is to flourish it needs a stable environment.    It alsoneeds confidence in a steadily growing market for its products both at homeand abroad.    It needs the prospects of a satisfactory return on its invest-^ent.^9.       North Sea oil gives us greater freedom of manoeuvre to meet these**eeds of industry.    With less constraint from the balance of payments, wecan use this freedom to pursue policies which offer the prospect of steadiergrowth of demand at higher levels than would otherwise have been possible.*n the first stage of recovery, increased personal consumption will contributelrectly to creating a favourable climate for industrial expansion.    As the
recovery proceeds, more caution will be needed, to ensure that resources which, on a longer term view, should be devoted to industrial investment and infra-structure, are not pre-empted, as has often happened in the past,by unsustainable increases in consumption.30. Investment can be planned and executed only within industry itself.But in partnership with both sides of industry, there are ways in which theGovernment can help directly.    For a start, the Government can guaranteea stable framework of assistance.    Although Britain&apos;8 system of generalinvestment incentives is already comprehensive and generous, the availability of North Sea revenues brings an important extra dimension.    For it should give industry confidence in the Governments intention that the system will bemaintained even when recovery has begun to put pressure on resources.Without assurance of stability, much of the incentive value of the system maybe lost - particularly for those parts of industry which need time, persistenceand resources to develop appropriate high investment strategies.31. North Sea revenues will also allow an expansion of selective assistance,The normal test for most investment projects will, of course, remain thatthey can attract commercial funding in competition with other investment projects.    But experience has shown that the capital market needs to be supplemented by selective intervention - where the risks are high and worthtaking or where the pay-off is long term.32. The National Enterprise Board will continue to play a vital role in the selective promotion of worthwhile investment - either directly, or in partnership with private industry.    It will be particularly important in tworespects.    First, it will continue to exercise entrepreneurial initiative in promoting or assisting the reorganisation of an industry.    Second, it willconcentrate especially on providing worthwhile investment and employmentJn the areas of high unemployment.33. The tripartite industrial strategy points the way forward by steadilybuilding up. sector by sector, a detailed picture of the opportunities ahead and the action needed to seize them.    There are many areas where UnitedKingdom industry has strengths on which we can build.    There are newProducts and processes to be developed and exploited.    The Government will do everything possible to further the industrial strategy through the Sectorforking Parties and to encourage the firms and unions concerned to see thattbe conclusions of the Working Parties are translated into positive action intbe board room and on the shop floor.    Planning Agreements will provide a^enas of concerting action by Government and individual firms, as willdiscussions between firms and their sponsoring Departments, linked with theindustrial strategy at sectoral level.34. Despite the relative improvement in the position of the assisted areasver the last ten years as a result of regional policy, much remains to bedone, especially in the older conurbations.    The Government intends thatsome part of the North Sea oil revenues should be used to tackle the long-standing problems of Scotland as well as the other assisted areas. Thetegional policies already in operation, together with the activities of the
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Development Agencies and the NEBwill continue, both directly and in pax tnership with private industry, but theGovernment believes that more needs to be done.    The emphasis will be onprojects or schemes aimed at the expansion of industry in thee regions andon ensuring that they are well placed to benefit from the industrial strategy.This will require not only funds for industrial investment, but expenditureon improved infra-structure, particularly in tackling the deep-seated problemsof the Special Development Areas, thereby creating conditions for growth,high employment and an improved quality of life.ENERGY35. Two further areas where the Government intends to use the oilrevenues to enable more to be done than would otherwise have been the caseconcern the production and conservation of energy itself.36. The first is investment in alternative energy sources to meet theneeds of our economy in the medium -term and then to assure our supplieswhen North Sea oil and gas begin to run out.    On current forecasts, UnitedKingdom primary energy demand is expected to rise from a total of200 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1975 to perhaps 240 million tonnes in1985, to some 330 million tonnes by the end of the century, and to go onrising thereafter.    During this period, North Sea oil production is likely torise to a peak of 100-150 million tonnes in the middle 1980s, and then to decline to rather less than 100 million tonnes by the end of the century andprogressively to decline thereafter.37. Investment in new energy sources will therefore be needed if oursupply objectives are to be met.    Our main need will be for very substantialinvestments in conventional energy sources - coal, gas, oil and nuclear power.    But in addition to these investments in conventional energy, we shall require a growing expenditure both on new and unconventional sources of fuelsupply and possibly on the conversion of primary fuels (e. g coal) into moreUsable forms of energy (e.g. gas).    As well as this, more effort can be putinto work on renewable forms of energy - solar, wind, wave, tidal and geo-thermal power, where projects are at the moment only in the early feasibilitystage;  while it is unlikely that such projects will produce very large amounts of energy, they could be a useful supplement to conventional sources. TheGovernment has already published a Green Paper on Energy Policy whichoutlines important possibilities in the field of energy research anddevelopment.38*        Directly linked with this is the need for more energy conservation.Conservation policies have saved us approximately  2, 000 million over thelast four years:  and new policies announced at the end of 1977 aim at ana*inual saving of 10 million tons of oil equivalent worth some  700 million.Reserves of sources such as oil, natural gas and coal are finite, and world demand is increasing.    By the end of the century, energy could cost two orthree times what it costs today.    Further development   of energy conserva-kon measures will therefore be an integral part of energy policy, both todeduce costs and to provide more time to develop and introduce thetechnologies that must ultimately replace existing fuels.    A long-term8
conservation scrategv may well need to include measures other than public investment,  such as pricing policies or  fiscal action.    But investment inthis area will remain important, not least because it can have short leadtimes, tends to be labour-intensive and in some instances offers very highreturns.    The Governments aim will be to achieve the maximum saving3and energy use which can be economically justified.39. Investment of the oil revenues in replacement energy and conservationis a way of spreading the benefits of North Sea oil forward so that futuregenerations may enjoy the security of energy supplies which we have today:and it may be one of the most productive ways in which they can be invested.It is likely to enjoy a high rate of return in its own right.    And by reducingand postponing the need to import energy, it will both improve the balance ofpayments and increase the security of our energy supplies.TAX REDUCTIONS40. The Government sees scope for a considerable reduction in taxationin the next few years.    However, a programme of major tax reductions, with no direct provision for any expansion in the economy&apos;s productive base, might increase national living standards only temporarily.    Of course, in the future,with North Sea oil helping the balance of payments by up to  X billion a year,it is possible that we might be able to sustain a consumer-led boom for longer than we have managed in the past;  fur the--more, reductions in taxation will certainly be needed to start the process of expansion.    But unless accompan-ied by other permanent improvements in our economy, expansion of consumerdemand might well benefit foreign rather than domestic suppliers and wouldnot be sustainable in the long run.41. In the Governments view, increases in investment and in living standards are mutually reinforcing.    With the investment strategy revitalis-ing the United Kingdom&apos;s economic performance, faster economic growth willenable the Government to continue with, its programme of reducing the burdenof personal taxation.    This would not only improve work incentives,strengthening the economic recovery and making a return to xull employmentsaaicr; it will also ensure that real take-home pay can be increased without1I*flationary rises in money wages, thereby reducing labour costs and improving competitiveness.PUBLIC SPENDING AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT42. The measures discussed above to increase industrial investment, toproduce and conserve energy, and to increase the general level of economic activity, will lead to a faster growth in the economy.    There are those whoargue that the fruits of that growth should go entirely to private consumption. .For the reasons given above, the Government rejects that view.    In acomplex, modern society, both public and private spending have a part to play,each supplementing the contribution of the other in our mixed economy.    It is*or the nation to strike a balance between the two, recognising that the required growth in public investment and services will need to be related to*ne growth in the economy.9
43. In striking the balance in the 1980s, the Government will need to payparticular attention to the problem of ensuring that more jobs are available.In the early stages at least, the process of modernising cur manufacturing industry will often involve a slimming-down of the workforce.    New technologyoften means less jobs, not more.    Jobs for the workers displaced will have tocome in part from the service sector, including public services.44. The Government intends to retain a firm control over public expendi-ture so that it remains within the limits set out in the annual public expenditure White Papers and does not absorb too high a proportion of thenation1 s resources.    However, certain areas of the public sector can be identified where it would be in the national interest to devote some of theNorth Sea revenues.45. The investment plans of the nationalised industries will need tonoatch the expansion of the economy: expenditure on essential communications.,docks, harbours, etc. mii3t keep pace.46. The problem of our inner cities is also urgent.    The Government hasalready given priority to its plans for reinvigorating the inner areas ofcertain specified conurbations.    The better economic performance that we expect will enable this programme to be pursued with continuing vigour in theyears ahead.    In these areas, what still remains of the social fabric of theVictorian era - the run-down houses, the hospitals and schools which all sections of the community use - is collapsing and must be made new.4 7.       We shall also need a more ambitious training and retraining pro-gramme in industry, in educational establishments, and in training centres,to develop industrial and commercial skills in our working population. Ourmanpower is our most valuable enduring national resource, and, during muchof the period when the oil revenues are flowing the number of young peoplecoming into employment will be falling.    Two things follow.    The preparationof young people for the world of work must be the best we can give them,developing fully their potential talents.    Secondly, there will be the need andthe opportunity to make it possible for more men and women to continue their education and to be trained and retrained throughout their working life.In all this, the emphasis must be on quality, relevance and adaptability,since North Sea oil creates both the need and the resources in our people and1X1 the skills to safeguard our future.48.       A growing economy would enable us to do more to build a fairer anda more compassionate society.    Thanks to the expansion of our public services, the lot of the disadvantaged has improved.    But our provision for old, the 3ick, the disabled, mentally as well as physically, and theinadequately-housed, still falls short of what we should all like it to be. Itls fundamental to the Governments philosophy that these groups should share111 the additional resources which a more efficient economy will provide.10
A NORTH SFA OIL FUND49. This is an ambitious programme.    It includes of course things whichwe would ha\e undertaken without North Sea oil.    The latter however givesus additional resources and reduces the constraints.    The Governmentbftlievie that this augmented programme is fully capable of achievement. Itwill however, take years of determined effort as the Government revenue from North Sea oil builds up from  1^  billion in 1979 to about  4 billion ayear in the mid-1980s and is channelled towards transforming our economicand industrial performance, securing our energy position in the longer-term and improving our economic and social infra-structure.50. Moreover the relative weight to be given to our various objectiveswill change as the economy gains in strength.    Priority at first must be givento getting the economy expanding fast enough to reduce unemployment. Asthe recovery gets under way, the emphasis will need to shift to investmentboth in industry and energy supplies.    Precisely because it is a long-term programme that has to be set in a wider context, it will need to be implement-ed flexibly.    This makes it the more necessary to set objectives andregularly to monitor progress towards them.    Only in this way can wecontain the risk of dissipating the advantages which North Sea oil can give us.51. The Government has considered whether this need to monitor andaccount for the use being made of the North Sea revenues can best be done byrneans of a special Fund or by regular White Papers setting out the progress made in achieving these objectives /or both/./Alternative Paragraphs52A.     The Government believes that the existence of a special Fund is more likely to safeguard the oil revenues coming into tho budget from the competing claims of other needs which may be desirable and pressing, but of less long-term value to the country&apos;s future.    A special Fund will also give the nationconfidence that the priorities set out in this paper will be met and those concerned will be able to plan in confidence that substantial resources will beavailable over a period of years.53A.     From a psychological point of view, a Fund would help to concentrateQur mind on the once-and-for-all nature of our North Sea wealth, and theneed to use it in the interests of the whole nation.    In particular, we need toensure that to the maximum extent possible, the use of the oil revenues willbe visible and accountable.    We have therefore decided to set up an Oil fund which will focus attention on this new source of revenue and which will help to ensure that the revenues are not dissipated unwisely.    The government believes that both Parliament and the public will welcome the opportunity^bich the Fund will provide for continuing informed discussion about thedistribution of a precious national asset.11
OR5EB.     The main argument put forward for a Fund is that it would avoid the revenues being dissipated unwisely and would provide the medium for continued informed discussion about the distribution of a precious nationalasset.    A Fund in the technical sense would, however, only be practicable ifthe oil revenues were being devoted to an identifiable project or projects oractivities which would not otherwise have been undertaken and which werefinanced solely or mainly in this way.    The Government&apos;s intention is,however, to use the benefits of North Sea oil as one element in a widerstrategy for national recovery.    This means that there would be no way ofshowing with any conviction what expenditure on, eg industrial investment,energy resources or infra-structure, was part of the Governments ordinaryprogramme and which was additional as a result of North Sea oil.53B.     The Government does not therefore propose to establish an Oil Fundas such.    But it is essential that progress towards the objectives set out inthis White Paper should be properly and publicly monitored. TheGovernment intends to make an annual report to Parliament on the progress made towards its objectives for the use of the North Sea revenues. Thiswould allow account to be taken of the wider benefits which the North Sea willprovide in the running of the economy which could not, in any case, form partcf an Oil Fund.JCONCLUSION54. For the next decade we shall have the considerable revenues of north sea oil and fewer balance of payments problems than we have had since thewar.    The Government intend to use this time as an opportunity to securelasting national economic recovery.    This means setting clear priorities forthe use of North Sea benefits.55. The Government is confident   that the strategy described in thisWhi te Paper is the right one.    The Government will set the framework andPlay its own part:  we are committed to increasing economic activity andemployment.    Better living standards should follow from that and from the tax reductions which can be genuinely afforded.    Investment in both thePrivate and public sectors is an essential part of the strategy.    But invest-ment - whether in manufacturing industry, in the energy industry, or inessential social infra-structure - is not enough.    As a people we have beengiven the chance to harness our talents and energies to a programme ofNational Recovery, that will rebuild Britain&apos;s prosperity and greatness.It is in that spirit that the Government invites the nation to use the decade of opportunity presented by North Sea oil.12

The extent of possible variations is roughly indicated by the ranges shown.*   The production profile shown for oil is consistent with recoverableoil reserves in the range 3,000 to ^,500 million tonnes. Thisbroad range reflects the difficulty of estimating reserves. Ifreserves toward the upper end of the range prove to be recoverablethen the level of production in 1990 and thereafter would beincreased accordingly.&apos;   The projections of UK gas production are based on the 1977 BrownBook (Table 3) estimates of total UK reserves 51 trillion cubicfeet (tcf).   The specific profile shown, which is only one amonga range and is subject to decisions about depletion policy, is consistent with that assumed in Energy Commission Paper   Number 1.&apos;   Based on the point estimates for oil production.i%   The valuation of gas production is based on the contract pricesPaid by the BGC.8,to uncertainty about the 6ize of future discoveries and thelevel of costs no meaningful estimates can be made for 1990.
