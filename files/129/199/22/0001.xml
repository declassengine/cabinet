DRAFTELEVENTH REPORT FROM THE EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE, SESSION 1976-77:THE CIVIL SERVICEGENERAL OBSERVATIONS1. In its Eleventh Report for the Session 1976-77 (HC 535),&quot;the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons made a wide range of recommendations &quot;designed to help the Civil Service toa good Job better&quot;.2. The enquiry by the General Sub-Committee of the expenditure committee was the first review of the Civil Service by a Select-Committee of the House of Commons since 194-2 (16th Report of theSelect Committee on National Expenditure, Session 1941-42(HC 120)).   More recently, however, following a recommendation inthe Estimates Committee Re-ort on Recruitment to the Civil Service1964-65 (HC 308), a comprehensive review of the structure,recruitment and management of the Civil Service was undertaken by the Fulton Committee.   The acceptance of that Committee^Report (Cmnd 3638) in 1968 resulted in a number of radical changesin the organisation and management of the Civil Service. TheGovernment recognise the value of the contribution of theExpenditure Committee&apos;s Report to the further discussion of subjects which are of great importance to the Government,parliainent and the public;   and they welcome the opportunityafforded by the Report to assess the way in which the Civil service has developed since 1968.   This assessment has to reflect the longstanding objectives of Civil Service management:    namely toPromote efficiency and reduce administrative costs and to securethe co-operation of the staff in achieving this.CONFIDENTIAL
confidential.     The Government agree with many of the Expenditure Comm1recommendations;   where they do not, their reasons are fully seout below.    Throughout, they have considered the recommendati0against the background of their belief that the interests ocountry will continue to be best served by a non-political?permanent civil service working under the close policy superviof the Government of the day.    They distinguish between theresponsibility of the Civil Service to the Government and theresoonsibility of the Government to Parliament. ministers of tteare responsible to Parliament for policy, and any extension* ridin&amp;accountability of civil servants must recognise the over-a responsibility of the Departmental Minister for the work and efficiency of his Department.    The Government do not theref01&quot;favour developments which would detract from the principle^e ^the advice tendered to Ministers by civil servants should beconfidential and objective, or require civil servants raw-Ministers to defend Government oolicies before ParliamentaryCommittees.   Within this framework however the Governmentthe great importance of enabling Ministers to ensure, and parliament to check, that public expenditure is properlyefficiently deployed.andINTRODUCTION4.     In the introduction to its Report, the Expenditurerecommended:of tbeRecommendation (1):    &quot;In future the various aspectsCivil Service should be regularly reviewed by apPr0Pcommittees of the House.&quot;The Government take note of the views of the Select Commithe various aspects of the Civil Service should be reviewedregularly by appropriate Committees of the House.CONFIDENTIAL
CteR II: RECRUITMENTRecommendation (2):    &quot;The Civil Service commission should keep, assess and publish statistics showing the type and class of decree of applicants and recruits interms of type of school and university attended, inorder to ensure, and to be able to show, that equallyable university graduates have equal chances of entering the service.11Recommendation (3):    &quot;The Civil Service Commission of four civil servants seems rather inbred and should be expanded by adding outside part-time Commissioners tothe existing full time civil servant membership, sothat these outsiders form a majority of the new commission.&quot;Recommendation (4):    &quot;It would be worth the new commission considering widening the membership of theFinal Selection Boards.&quot;Recommendation (5):    &quot;The new Commission should alsoreassess and change the Method II entry system to theService.&quot;The Commissioners agree to collect and publish statistics to showcvPe and class of degree of applicants and recruits in terms ofOll0ol and university attended.    Such statistics will provide usefulNation on the background of Administration Trainees (ATs). Butgovernment do not accept that academic performance ia the only02? to bo taken into account in recommending candidates forOintment in administration.-&quot;-ne Government agree that the addition of some part-time&quot;-^loners from outside the Civil Service would enlarge thet-ncuse of experience on which the selectors could draw, and will0o*nmend the appointment of tv/o such Commissioners.?; TAI* all the recruitment carried out by the Commission the^proportion of interviewers from outside the Civil Service is highsome of the stages outsiders are in the majority.   Appendix AUe Commission^ Annual Report for 1976 lists 720 people who
CONFIDENTIALserved as chairmen or members of selection boards during the year*of these, 383, or 54$, were not and had never been employed inCivil Service.   And of the 234 examiners listed in Appendix B,226, or 97$, had not been in the Civil Service.   These included the examiners who mark the written Qualifying Tests that candid&amp;&quot;fcefor Administration Trainee appointments have to pass if they areto be invited to attend the Civil Service Selection Board (CSSB)-In these written tests, where candidates are anonymous tothe examiners, candidates from independent schools are more successful than those from maintained schools9 and candidatesfrom Oxford and Cambridge markedly more successful than those from other universities.   Of the 117 assessors on CSSB, 40, or34$, are outsiders engaged by the Commission on a part-time basis&apos;ral8. The Final Selection Board (FSB) normally comprisest^the First Commissioner (or one of his colleagues) 111chair, two serving civil servants and two outsiders.   One ofoutsiders is an academic and the other is drawn from a genemany of whose members have extensive experience of industrial ^A tO &amp;commercial management or of trades unions.    Intervlewers need.ded ^something of the work done and the qualities of the staff ^eegovernment departments;   how far thi.3 is compatible with a v/3.of outside membership will be discussed with the new part-timeofCommissioners, as recommended.   The suggestion in paragraph 1^tba11Report that there should occasionally be more outside memberscivil servants will be implemented in the 1978 recruiting season
CONFIDENTIALh    Setting aside the question of whether the CSSB procedure(formerly known ao Method II) is or is not satisfactory as a meansof selecting the most meritorious candidates, the Committee consideredtb*t it was almost bound to inspire criticism, since it depended&quot;**e on interviewing applicants than on written examinations&quot;.believed it should be modified in order that it could be8ee* to be fair.l0.   In fact, the CSSB procedure depends more on written examinationsth** on interviewing.   It is an extended procedure developed inCognition of the limitations of the traditional interview as* method of selection, and in the process of selecting an AT, which0c*upies rather more than 18 working hours, only 14* of the time ison interviews.    If the group discussion and the committee$ItNoises are included, the figure rises to 24*.   In other words, ataet three-quarters of the procedure consists of written tests andseises.    But this is certainly not to say that the oral work and*.i.:*e*views are of secondary importance.   The CSSB system is a blendral and written work, based on experience over more than thirty**ar*and the professional advice of occupational psychologists, andi80ne that has been widely copied by outside organisations.ft;The Commies!oners will nevertheless reassess  the extendedection procedure, both in its substance and appearance. InXil8 Qo, they will also wish to take account of any observationscn the committee which is now reviewing the AT scheme may make^ rQspect of the procedures for selecting Administration Trainees8uch special intakes of graduates as might be required if theII confidential
present scheme were to he abolished.   But they would not wish topre-,judge the outcome of their reassessment by committing themselveat this stage to changing the procedure.   They have pointed ou^the selection procedure was scrutinised in detail as recently 8Sby a Committee of Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Mr J G Vf Da^eOBE, whose membership of five included   three professional selecand psychologists and only one civil servant (an administrator)(Cmnd 4156).   The procedure examined and approved by the DaviesCommittee, and subsequently modified in a few particulars to take account of their recommendations, is the procedure in use today-
CHAPTER Hi: TRAININGRecommendation (6):    &quot;The CSD should take additionalsteps to assess and monitor departmental trainingschemes and urgently consider whether work currentlydone by the Civil Service College could not be doneby Departments or non-Civil Service educationalinstitutions.&quot;12-   Central monitoring of departmental training has been increased inrecent years following the Heaton-Williams Report.   The proposal that some training currently done at the College should be doneelsewhere will be examined in the context of the Committee&apos;s other^commendations concerning training, especially their proposal fora development programme for higher management.Recommendation (7):    &quot;The existing AdministrationTrainee scheme should be abolished.   Graduates with good degrees should still be recruited and givendobs in the service so that their abilities S*herthan solely academic ones can be assessJ** *h2  *Mthen comoete on even terms with others in the service,graduates and non-graduates, for entry to a new highermanagement training course.l3&apos;   In recommending that the existing Administration Trainee (AT)8ci*me should be abolished, the Expenditure Committee went on to state(pa*a graph 20 of its Report) &quot;That graduates with good degrees shouldbeRecruited we do not, of course, dispute and it may be that therekQuld be some special recruitment grade for them in addition to theflrp oiSo recruited.    We do howevercutive grades at which graduates are also reciuxWn , ^   ^^-^tPfi bv a different method as weuelleve that they should be recruiteci oy *^ recommended in paragraph 15 above.&quot;^   The Expenditure Committee is already aware, and has mentioned atSeraph 19 of its Report, that the working of the AT scheme is at^sent beins reviewed by an inter-departmental committee.   The AT^iew Committee will be considering not only the question of
CONFIDENTIALgraduate recruitment into the Administration Group but alsorelated aspects of the identification and development of kigbpotential among those already within the Service.    In its deliberations and in framing its recommendations, it will ^a^efully into account the views expressed by the expenditure committee, including those quoted in the preceding paragraphRecommendation (8):    &quot;The normal practice should be *nano one will be promoted beyond the rank of assistant secretary or equivalent unless he or she had complete^the new higher management training course.&quot;Recommendation (9)&apos; &quot;The new course should consist ofacademic courses, &quot;on the Job&quot; training, seminars, aoaproblem-solving case studies.&quot;Recommendation (10):    &quot;NHS, Local government staff&apos; ???ed t0civil servants in the foreign service should be adca11the new course.&quot;15*    The Government endorse the general principle of mia-^developmental training for both specialists and generaliseexpected to go to the highest levels in the Service. -neinent will also consider how any new developments in mid-ocltraining might provide opportunities to improve Civil Servic ^* prirlCknowledge of outside sectors, and vice versa.    With these *in mind, the Service will be developing proposals for mio-nle ^training.  In this it will wish to take account of the roj-could usefully be played by other training institutions.16.     For some officers, there may be forms of mid-career 03qother than formal training courses which would be more apPr0pSelection for any special programme would always need to ta*6 Jaccount of individual circumstances, and it would be wrong fmuch reliance on written examinations.    This would be a true in respect of specialists, for whom any new trainingill ^would be of great importance.    Initially, therefore, i* *necessary to concentrate on those most likely to benenu ,III confidential
c*reer training.    These will tend to be the young potential promotees,a0Q all disciplines.    The Government do not believe that it isirable to make the completion of a higher management training4esCourse a necessary condition of promotion beyond the rank of AssistantSec]^ecretary.    This would be too expensive in resource terras and veryto many able and experienced civil servants who achieve andtheir^U^y justify promotion to this level in the Service only late incareers.&quot; The Government&apos;s underlying objective is to develop the talentsnd improve the skills and performance of the upper reaches of the^-ce - and to do so as quickly as the necessary training resourcesn^n be made available, bearing other demands in mind.    Both the absenceauty of senior officers while undergoing lengthy training and theVision of the training itself are very expensive in resource terms:cost of building up a system to an optimum level would be*Ub*tantial.Ill confidential
CONFIDENTIAL jCHAPTER IV:      CAREER MANAGEMENTsRecommendation (11):    &quot;The unified grading of the openstructure at the top of the Civil Service should be extencedownwards to Assistant Secretary as speedily as possible.Work should begin on a further extension to Principal leveJ-at least.&quot;18.    The Committee finds the Fulton Report1s arguments for a fullunified grading structure as valid now as 10 years ago.    At thattime an extensive review, which included outside consultants inreview team, did not produce proposals for effecting unificationthat case, down to Senior Principal and equivalent levels) which ,acceptable to management and the unions.    The Government are not ^a . orprepared to impose/unified grading structure on unwilling unions, ^to pay a high price in terms of additional wage costs in order tosecure their agreement. ^19*    In order to develop the best available talent and use it Pr0?management must always be prepared to give individuals the necessrange of experience.    It is, of course, necessary to have a gradiD&amp; 23structure which does not inhibit this process.    As the Committeerecognises, some progress has been made through simplifying the (5ra pe:structure of the Service in the wake of the Fulton Report, andand departmental &quot;classes&quot; are now roughly one third the number ^were in 1968.20.   Nevertheless, in view of the Committee1s endorsement of tneFulton Committee^ arguments, the CSD and departments will exaininefurther, with the National Staff Side (NSS), the extension of uni, Thigrading down to the Assistant Secretary and equivalent levels,examination might entail the need to draw on outsideconsultants at some or all stages.IV 1rnwFinFWTiAf
21. In the light of any lessons learned from that examination, theCSD will consider further extension downwards, to the Principal level,as the Expenditure Committee recommends;    although as the level goesdown, the difficulties will be likely to grow, not least for theindividual unions in the NSS.22. Throughout this approach, careful attention will be paid toresource costs.    It will be necessary to prescribe both that the totalcost of any new unified structure resulting from the examination shouldnot significantly exceed (and preferably, indeed, be less than) thatOf the structure it replaces, and that it should be capable of with-standing the pressures imposed on it by the need to reconcile internalrelativities, as determined by job evaluation, with the external payrates, as determined by the market.Recommendation (12):    &quot;There is merit in showing annual reports to and discussing them with the individuals concerned.&quot;The Government agree with the Select Committee that individuals^ould be told by their superiors of the latest assessment of theirPerformance so that they may know clearly where they stand and takes^eps to remedy any weaknesses which have been identified.    On theother hand, experience indicates that confidentiality in the context0f annual reporting be.ets impariality and honesty:    to show peopletbeir annual reports tends to result in reports becoming less specificAssessments of performance and future potential.   The system of annualtridential reports is very important in personnel management:Owning which blurs the sharpness of the picture drawn by reports**kos it more difficult to differentiate between individuals, and^e^efore damages the standards of staff development and selection for^ansfer and promotion.IV 2rnMnncMtiAi
24.   Partly in order to help individuals know how they are progressionthe Job Appraisal Review .in their present job,/(JAR), an annual discussion between the indiviand the officer countersigning his report, has been widely introduced in the Service since 1971.   Yftiere it has not been possible to introa full JAR system, as much interviewing as possible is arranged to fleethe same ends.   Criticism and encouragement are both conveyed to pooP*more sensitively by word of mouth than by the written word, and thefeis evidence to suggest that JARs are leading to a valuable frankness 0both sides in discussions of performance.    But, although they are1*1generally required to express their views on promotability and P0&quot;6 .in annual reports, the line managers who write reports and conductare not in a position to impart this view to the individual withcauthority since it requires a wider knowledge both of the individual ^and of standards prevailing across the department.   Career interviealready widely available on request, are conducted by staff with ^relatiHi, ioI1necessary knowledge about the wider departmental position/to prom ^-prospects. ^li25.    The Government believe that, as confidence grows in JARs, the ^broad aim which the Committee endorsed can best be met by encouF8^ athe disclosure of certain parts of the annual report orally with3-11      . ,Pro?&apos;5&apos;framework of discussion offered by the JAR or other interviews,are now under discussion aimed at making further progress on thesRecommendation (13):   &quot;Some means of reporting onprospective top Civil Service managers is alsoneeded.&quot;26*   Such arrangements already exist.   Written reports or assesshave long been made annually on almost all non-industrial civi-1-The standard report form, which is used generally for staff
\% . CONFIDENTIALAssistant Secretary level and below, provides not only for detailed^formation to be given about performance in the current job but also for an indication of training needs and of future potential. Reportset   0a staff in the Open Structure (ie Under Secretary level and above)are less formal but cover as much of the same ground as is relevant.la0u   ^*   These basic reporting arrangements are complemented by a standing^ocedure, which began some years before Fulton and which has since been^eveloped, for the early identification and progressive assessment ofp   Prospective top Civil Service managers.   Departments are asked by theC^D each year to carry out a special exercise to identify and report only*aff with special potential, ie likely to become top managers in thelf    Se*Vice.   The procedure applies equally to administrators and specialists,^&quot;t in the latter case Departments identify both those who are deemed$   *0 have the potential for promotion inside their particular specialism,^ those who could perform well in a wide range of posts, eg general^encouragement  or in administrative posts.   Thi3 information, supported bydividual assessments, is held within CSD and is used for career,    *ev&amp;development  and succession planning.    It forms the basis of discussion16   ^ing annual visits arranged for these purposes by senior CSD officialsjo^ *0 all Heads of Departments.
Recommendation (14-):    &quot;We anticipate transfers in and (out of the Civil Service but suggest that the Government concurrence should be required contractually or by legislatewhen ex-Civil Servants are appointed by companies to jobswith close financial links with Government.1128.   The Committee referred to the existing rules which already requireall officers of the rank of Under Secretary (or, in the diplomatic service,    Counsellors) and above, and of equivalent ranks in HM For0to obtain the assent of the Government before accepting, within   Jof resignation or retirement, offers of employment in business or 0bodies.   The rules cover business or other bodies:a. v/hich are in contractual relationships with theGovernment;b. v/hich are in receipt of subsidies or their equivalentfrom the Government;c. in which the Government is a shareholder;d. which are in receipt from the Government of loans,guarantees or other forms of capital assistance; ore. with which Services, or departments, or branches ofGovernment are, as a matter of course, in a special relationas well as semi-public organisations brought into being by theGovernment or Parliament.    In addition, there are posts of a sped8or technical nature below the rank of Under Secretary to which depments must apply a similar requirement.lid 3529* The Government are advised that agreements which restrict theright of an individual to take up employment are normally inva
1CONFIDENTIALkeing in restraint of trade, and that it cannot be said that a contractual condition requiring a civil servant to obtain the Govern-^nfs assent before taking up new employment falls within any of the^cognised exceptions.    Furthermore, even if it did, enforcementv,&apos;0uld often be impracticable if the person concerned, had already,e,   eritered into a contract of employment with a new employer. Legislationjrs - Vould therefore seem to be necessary before an effective legal obligationjeT  0ould be imposed on an officer to obtain such assent.In practice, disciplinary action could not be applied to a civil8et*vant who had resigned or retired.   The present statutory provisions for forfeiture or abatement of pension could not apply to a refusalV a civil servant to accept the withholding by the Government of assent^0 a business appointment,j. alternatively,-*   The Committee drew attention,/to legislation to penalise employers^Pointing former civil servants without obtaining any necessary0vernment assent.   However, the Royal Commission on Standards of?i.   0^uct in Public Life (Cmnd 6524, July 1976; paragraphs 204, 205),^Sued against the application of the criminal law in such situations.*eover, there could be difficulty in prescribing appropriateNaties.r*   The Government will continue to watch how the existing rules,have only recently been changed, are working.IV 6CONFIDENTS
CHAPTER V: PAYRecommendation (15) :    &quot;The Pay Research Unit should be made responsible to a board which, though it might well includethe present members of the Steering Committee of the NationaVhitley Council, should also include outside appointees. .the new board should recommend their choice of Director to prime Minister and both the Director and some of his staff should not in future invariably be civil servants.&quot;Recommendation (16):    &quot;Anonyraised PRU reports should be vi5oV5published in agreement with the firms with which pay compa?-Jare made.&quot;Recommendation (19) (Chapter VI):    &quot;The PRU should bereactivated as speedily as possible.&quot;33.   The Government have agreed to reactivate the Pay Research(PRU) as soon as possible.    Negotiations with the Civil Service union were begun in July 1977 with a view to effecting changes in the Pa^research arrangements very much along the lines recommended by theCommittee.    The results of these negotiations were announced inParliament on 21 November 1977*34*   The agreement included the proposal to establish a Pay ReseattksUnit Board, with an independent Chairman and members.    Subject &quot;toobservance of certain restrictions on con.fidential.ity, it was al^0agreed that there would be greater openness about the work of the through the publication of an annual report by the new Board. *that raddition, it was agreed /tuture appointments to the post of Directofwould be on the basis of the best candidate available regardlesswhether he or she was a civil servant, and that the remaining stated-the Unit should include a proportion of non-civil servants. ^nat&apos;basis of this agreement, the Government have authorised the restotoof pay research for the settlement due from 1 April 1979 subjectany requirements of incomes policy at the time.    This is the fir
which it is technically feasible for full pay research evidence tobe collected and made available by the PRU.Recommendation (17):    &quot;Top civil servants should be paid the rate for the job and the Top Salaries Review body should compare them with top executives in other organisations to determine what their pay should be.    It should not cutdown on the levels it believes fair but leave that to governments to do if they feel it necessary.&quot;Recommendation (18):    &quot;When new higher rates are introduced the CSD should review all relevant posts to ensure they arecorrectly graded.    We also welcome the TSR3fs intention toconsider range pay for these grades.&quot;rtf    350   The Government recognise that much in these recommendations isErected to the independent Review Body on Top Salaries, which has the*esPonsibility for advising the Prime Minister on the remuneration of8snior civil servants.    For their part, the Government have undertaken^0 accept the Review Bodyfs recommendations unless there are clear andspelling reasons for not doing so.    The Government will be ready toCo&quot;*operate in any examination of range pay which the Review BodyWiQhes to undertake.    The Government have always accepted the need forContinuous scrutiny of the grading of open structure posts through^e normal process of manpower control.V 2OOHFiDMTfAL
QO I v;i i- D EN I li J*CHAPTER VI: PENSIONS/The response to Recommendation 19 has been included inChapterRecommendation (20):    &quot;The system of the government actuary alone forecasting future trends should be changed.    The resulting forecasts should be published.&quot;36o   ^ne Government note the Committee^ recommendation on theforecasting of future trends and will ensure that such assistance as can usefully be offered by other Government departments is available^ethe Government Actuary and his Department.   They believe, howeveifthe Government Actuary alone, as an independent professional adviser&apos;must retain the responsibility for making these forecasts accordingthe ethics and disciplines of the actuarial- profession and the speCwide-ranging knowledge of up-to-date actuarial practice that is a^ato him because of his position.    It should be borne in mind thatactuarial forecasts relate to a significantly different timescrfj-those with which other forecasters,  eg Treasury economists, areconcerned, and reflect a different range of factors.    The Govern^nonetheless readily accept that the advice given by the government actuary and the assumptions on which that advice is based should re^published.    It is proposed, as part of the improvements in paymachinery, that in future the Government Actuary should make anreport, which would be published, setting out the advice he has and the assumptions he has made.VI confidential
rsCONFIDENTIALRecommendation (21):    &quot;Public service pensions are ahotch potch which the CSD and the DHSS should considerrationalising.&quot;3?.   The Committee recommended that the CSD and the DHSS should consider0ver a period of years to what extent a greater measure of uniformity^ public sector pension schemes could be achieved.    DHSS has no responsibility in the field of uniformity of public sector pensions.^*   There is an important distinction to be drawn between public servicethemes over which the Government have direct control and publicenterprise schemes in the wider public sector which are not subject tothe same control, such as the nationalised industry schemes referred to paragraphs 62 and 63 of the Report.??*   So far as public service schemes are concerned, apart from the need to cater for retirement at an earlier age and other occupational featuresiji special cases such as the Armed Forces and the Police, there isCousiderable uniformity in benefit provision.    The differences in thefitodancing arrangements,  to which the Committee drew attention, are duereasons which have so far been held to be over-riding However, the5overnment accept that the time may have come to establish whether that^mains the position, ?nd the questions raised by the Committee will bee*^mined by the departments concerned.Funding in the wider public sector field is a separate question.Report of the Post Office Review Committee (Cmnd 6850) examined thisNation and the Public Accounts Committee had already   referred to itln the context of 3ritish Railways in their 8th Report published duringth* 1376-77 Session.    In the light of that Report, this subject is.Gady being considered by the Government.VI confidential
CHAPTER VII:     REDUCING COSTS BY POLICY CHANGESRecommendation (22):    &quot;The Exchequer &amp; AuditDepartment should place more emphasis on checkingthe financial and manpower estimates published v/ithBills against eventual costs and staffing,&quot;41. The Government would welcome any greater emphasis which the comptroller &amp; Auditor General feels able to give to checking out^against the financial and manpower estimates published with Bills*Recommendation (23):    &quot;A programme of regular surveyson the possibilities of reducing costs by policy changes should be inaugurated and Parliament should be regularlyinformed of potential savings from policy changes,. TheGovernment should devise methods by which they could    t fjt&quot;continually report the options in this respect to Parliame42. This is one of several recommendations which bears upon the relationship between Parliament and the Executive and not uponCivil Service.    The business of government entails a constant ser. ns oi b of choices between policies and between various possible versiongiven policy.    Administrative cost is one important criterion for. ^,-t-iv^&apos;policy decisions and economy in administration is a major obj^cuBut it is not the sole criterion or the overriding objective whic^Ministers have to take into account.43. There is a constant process of review of policies, and costfactors feature prominently in all policy reviews.    The Governmedo not believe that there would be much advantage in undertaking aseries of regular special surveys directed at the possibility 01finding policy changes which would reduce administrative costs v;1out regard to the other consequences.    There is however advantagreviewing particular areas from time to time - eg operational. lit ^on which large numbers of staff are employed and where there miC *scope for simplification - with this objective in mind.VII 1rnNF!DENT!AL
CONFIDENTIAL44.   As the Government have frequently stated, their intention andtheir developing practice is to move towards more open government,Publication of the facts and considerations which are relevant toftajor policy decisions which will need to be taken, fall within thelisting practice on Green Papers.    The Governments policy on thePublication of background factual matter on decisions already takenwas referred to in the Prime Minister1s statement of 24 November1976.    Information on surveys in operational areas referred to in thePreceding paragraph can similarly be made available.
CHAPTER VIII:    MACHINERY OP GOVERNMENTRecommendation (24):    &quot;Splitting the Treasury bymerging its public expenditure divisions with the CSDwould be an irresponsible act.    Responsibility both for controlling all expenditure and for securingefficiency should be combined in the Treasury. those parts of the CSD concerned with the control of manpower and the efficiency of the Civil Service should betransferred to the Treasury, the CSD retainingresponsibility for personnel, appointments,recruitment, training, pay and pensions.&quot;Recommendation (35)  (Chapter X):    &quot;Ultimate responsible-ility for monitoring the control of efficiency shouldbe vested in the Treasury.&quot;45.   This is a question of the division of responsibilities between ministers and is therefore a matter for the Prime Minister. Eehas considered this part of the Committee1s Report very careful^&apos;While he welcomes the emphasis which the relevant section of theirReport placed on efficiency, he has not yet reached any view on particular recommendation and will therefore continue to study ^eissues involved.
0 0 m! F10 E l\l Tl A \*CHViPTER IX:      ORGANISATION FOR EFFICIENCYRecommendation (25):    &quot;Hiving off diminishesministerial control and proper control mechanismsfor hived off bodies should be developed,&quot;46*     The Government agree that within the present constitutionalframework most areas of government activity are unsuitable forhiving off;    and that, where hiving off is possible, care has to betaken to strike a correct balance between the degree of freedomof action given to the new authority and the degree of controland answerability retained by Ministers.4-7.     In all recent cases where departmental functions have beenhived off to new public bodies, and where new public bodies havebeen set up to take on a new acitivity, particular care has beentaken to ensure that the apjjropriate degree of ministerial control is set out in the enabling legislation (or other instrumentestablishing the new body - eg the Employment and Training Act1973, and the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1976.    Within thelegal framework of Ministerial control powers, close attention is always given to the administrative mechanisms for determining the allocation of resources to the body concerned.    It is alsoessential to monitor expenditure;    arrangements for doing this are given close attention and will, if necessary, be strengthened.Here too there is a need to balance the maintenance of adequateMinisterial control with the degree of independent managementaction which the establishment of a separate non-Ministerialbody is bound to imply.Recommendation (26):    &quot;There should be a determineddrive to introduce accountable units in all areas of executive work and, where possible, in administrative work.    They should be scaled down to the size mostconducive to effective control.&quot;IX confidential ______
Recommendation (27):    &quot;The advantages of acomplete reconstruction of the present system ofaccounting to Parliament would, outweigh the disadvantages.    In particular the accountspresented should correspond with the accountableunits.n4-8. The Government agree with the emphasis the Committee has put 0accountability:    the need to inculcate at every level of managemerit *concern for clear objectives and priorities;    the effective and econ0control of resources;    and the importance of monitoring and improve the levels of performance achieved with the resources over which tbemanager has control.    Every manager should be accountable to hissuperior manager in this sense.    I/inch has been achieved over the laS10 years, but there is still much to do.    One of the most important aspects of this is the development of management information andaccounting systems appropriate to each kind of work, ie systems toprovide the necessary basis for sound decision-taking,  effective &apos;Government will press ahead as fast as resources permit.and the proper assessment of performance.    In the absence of the c0private sector yardstick of profitability, the development of the-&apos;further*ef 5systems needs much care and uses up scarce skilled resources; x&quot;d tne r *progress is unlikely to be fast.    But the aim remains important antflirt I]4-9*   Accountable units are a special case of this general problemimply a form of organisation in which a particular unit of mana ernhas a sufficiently discrete task to make it sensible to isolate 1bl^within the structure and give its manager both clear and raeasuraobjectives and control over the resources needed to achieve the&quot;1,objectives of Government departments are complex and interrelatedway and to an extent which limit the number of tasks to which t 1 ^approach can successfully be applied, although the responsihil1 eindividual managers should always be established as clearly as VIX 2_ lfW,!nn.Fi\!TIA&apos;L
I CONFIDENTIALAs with accountability itself, accountable units can be identified ata number of levels within an organisation.50.   The Committee commented that the present system of Parliamentaryaccounting does not provide adequate management information.    There is,8f*hancial control and auditfand information gathered for othe:Managerial purposes.    No single form of published accounts could providithe information needed by management.    Any attempt to expand the^supply Estimates to incorporate further information of this kind would^-sk making them unmanageable, and departments already publish a gr^at deal of management related information in other forms.    If theCoccnittee considers that there are specific items of managerialformation which Parliament needs in addition to those already published,Government will be glad to consider the Committees suggestions.\t- rpke government note the Committee&apos;s views that the accounts^esented to Parliament should correspond with accountable units. The*&quot;0rm of these accounts has been adapted and developed over time in^esPonse to views expressed by the House and its Select Committees.**J0r reforms in the structure of Parliamentary Estimates and^Propriation Accounts were made in 1973.    Following these reforms,Wllich the Expenditure Committee and the Public Accounts Committeecorned, the Estimates have been presented primarily on a &quot;functional&quot;Programme&quot; basis, in line with the programme plans set out in thei M ^Ual Public Expenditure White Papers.

The Government have, in addition, set up trading funds, underTrading Funds Act 1973, for       PSA   Supplies in theProperty Services Agency, the Royal Mint and the Royal OrdnanceFactories.    Accounts for these funds are presented to Parliament,it is decided to finance other quasi-commercial services throughtrading funds,  the Government&apos;s intention will be to adapt the exi!accounts, and/or present new accounts as necessary, to ensure that parliament is kept fully informed.Recommendation (28):    &quot;The Treasury inconsultation with our General Sub-Committeeshould undertake research into the possibility of presenting analyses to Parliament showing the objectives of individual spending programmes andthe results of past programmes.&quot;53.   The Government have welcomed the contribution made by theExpenditure Committee in its Ninth Report for the Session1976-7/(HC466 ) in directing public attention to the objectives of seieehie x0expenditure programmes.    In general, the Government have been n%&amp;comply with the Committee^ recommendations that additional inforn!should be provided in the Public Expenditure White Paper or ined 0lJdepartmental papers.    The Committee1s recommendations were base

The Committee&quot;aid in that Report that its intention was, over a period of years, tofamine most, if not all, programmes.   The Government welcome thatMention and consider that it offers an effective way of making progre.^ the direction proposed by the Committee in its Eleventh Report.Recommendation (29):   &quot;Common services should becharged to Departments.&quot;In considering the case for charging any given common service toth&quot; departments which use it, the Government have to balance conflicting^derations.   On the one hand, the user mny have a greater incentive to economy if he has to pay for the service, although the strength ofVfte incentive will depend upon the cost, and his ability to chooseb*tween suppliers and between expenditure on the common service and0ther things.   On the other hand, the allied service system, whilelowing for the concentration of expert knowledge in one department,*Vc,ids the administrative and accounting costs of repayment.55&apos;   A case-by-case examination of common services since 1972, carried0u* with a presumption in favour of repayment, has shown that theVj-ance generally depends on the practical considerations relevant to service.    As stated in the Government&apos;s reply to the Committee&apos;s&quot;inth Report, the future basis on which HMSO provides goods and servicesls &quot;nder review.   As regards general office accommodation, the balanceH advantage lies in favour of allied service, because it is mostdomical to have a system under which a single common service depart-^ can effectively manage the estate as a pool from which to meet
the requirements of departments generally.    As long as estate manaSeniendecisions are taken centrally, there is no point in charging the cos sof those decisions to the users.    In some other cases, where these considerations do not apply, the Committee&apos;s objective has been met without the need for extra accounting by charging costs to the userdepartments public expenditure programme while leaving the cashprovision on the common service department&apos;s vote.    This has been doflv/ith specialised accommodation services and some services providedby HMSO and COI.    The allocation of common service expenditure to ^sedepartments and to programmes is, of course, shown annually in supporting Services Tables in the Supply Estimates,56     The Government agree with, the Committee that, in the absence Iof any financial constraint, there would be a risk that resources r jon an allied service, or indeed any other, basis would be used was^eBut there are substantial constraints:    the public expenditureprovisions and the estimates of the allied service departments are subject to scrutiny within the general arrangements for controlli11^public expenditure;    there are controls on manpower and the locatiorlof user departments;    there are maximum standards which are agreed $centrally;    and, where appropriate, there is the application of investment criteria and cost yardsticks.committee I and to the Public Accounts Committee in due course, ^ebalance of advantage as regards other services will also be revas required by changing circumstances;    the result of such revie^5will similarly be made known.tof&apos;1    IX 6I n tke57,   The decision on HMSO goods and services will be reported to
10**1Recommendation (30):    &quot;Cost comparisons-with the;s private sector should be normal practice in whateverareas of the Civil Service they are feasible.&quot;58. The Government agree in principle that the cost of Civil Servicederations should be compared with the private sector wherever useful.itOperations can be divided for costing purposes between the^vision of goods and services and between functional activities.\foere goods are provided to customers who are not obliged to purchase*rom Government organisations, it seems reasonable to assume thatOustomers are satisfied with price, quality and delivery.    Of the   , Factoriesrrading Funds, both the Royal Ordnance/and the Royal Mint sell aboutI half their output against international competition, while about halfI   ne sales under Property Services Agency Supplies contracts are made tohi,u.Vers who could purchase elsewhere but are attracted by the price0^ered.In providing other services, even where the function appears to^e comparable with one performed in the private sector (eg employment^cement), closer examination often reveals that there is no precise^ivate sector analogue.    The Government agency may, for instance, haveAfferent objectives;    it may have little or no scope for selectivityln the fields in which it is required to operate;    and it is generallySquired to give uniform and equitable treatment.    These factors will^ affect costs, and, consequently, cost comparisons with the private*ector may be of limited value.    Where such services are concerned,erefore, departments  efforts are best spent in concentrating directlyOftManaging the task in question as effectively and economically as^0ssible, while using cost comparisons where practicable for monitoring^Poses.
61.    The third area where costs may be compared is where activitiessuch as procurement, printing, reprographics, building maintenanceor transport are common to both the Civil Service and the private s*In these cases much is done as a matter of routine by way of examin^tenders for contracts and by seeking any appropriate yardsticks,for example, it has been established that it is cheaper for theGovernment to use its own passenger cars than to enter into contracthire arrangements.    Similarly, it has been found that specialisedblocks of printing work can be produced more economically withinGovernment printing works than by using contractual resources.IX confidential
CHAPTER X:    MONITORING EFFICIENCYRecommendation (31):    &quot;We concur with the Governmentthat effective cash limits should be fixed beforepay negotiations are entered into,&quot;62.   The Committee&apos;s Report does not correctly interpret the government&apos;s statements about the relationship between cash limits and pay negotiations.   The Government regard cash limits as a formof control over the amount of money to be spent on a wide range ofgoods and services in the year ahead, and not as a substitute fora Pay policy in the public sector.   However, when a.policygoverning pay is in operation, it is to be expected that the cashlimits will reflect that policy and the Government have made itclear that the assumptions used for setting the 1978-79 cash limitswill be framed accordingly.   The relationship between the settingof cash limits and pay negotiations is a complex one, depending on the timing of the settlement and its operative date.   Most cashlimits are set shortly before the beginning of the financial years that account can be taken of the latest available information about the planned levels of expenditure and the prospects for prices in the year ahead.Recommendation (32): &quot;Cash limits should be reviewed in relation to the apparatus of Parliamentary controlof expenditure.&quot;63.    The Government agree that the relationship between cashlimits and Parliaments role in granting Supply needs furtherconsideration.    The Select Committee on Procedure is reviewingthis area of Parliamentary procedure among others.    In their third report for the 1976-77 Session (HC-274) the confidential
I    II l\l H I I E** l\l  I  I f\ public Accounts Committee recommended that the Treasury should exaflineways of assimilating cash limits with a reformed system of Parlia&quot;mentary Estimates and Accounts,   The Treasury/consultation with owdepartments, is giving continuing consideration to the scope forassimilating the two systems in the light of the views which have DeeDexpressed.Recommendation (33):    &quot;Cash blocks must besystematically broken down within the Departmentto coincide with accountable units.&quot;64.    The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s endorsement of the Prlthat the size of cash blocks should provide scope for economicaland effective management while preserving financial control. Theas5Government agree that it is useful, within this broad control, t0the responsibility for controlling expenditure to suitable units wlthe department, including accountable units in the sense used inobservations on Recommendations 26 and 27 above.Recommendation (34):    &quot;Information on Departments1expenditure plans should be public, just asinformation on cash limits is.&quot;65* Information on annual expenditure plans is made public in theEstimates, the Chief Secretary&apos;s Memorandum and in some cases iQ &apos;departmental publications.    The cash limits, and the provisionaloutturn in relation to those cash limits when the year is over,published in White Papers.   Any changes in the cash limits are anfl0during the year.   Monitoring information on expenditure in the firsix months of the financial year, together with the profile forsame period set at the beginning of the year, is nov being publi5^at the same time as the winter Supplementary Estimates.X confidential Immmm A
^/&quot;The response to Recommendation 35 has been includedin Chapter VIII7Recommendation (36):    &quot;Management services should beon the same basis as staff inspection, ie their entry into Departments should be compulsory though not their recommendations.&quot;In concentrating its attention on management services and staffXtispection, the Committee has paid less attention to the CSD&apos;s SupplyAction.   Contrary to the impression created by paragraph 115 of the^ePort, the CSD controls the estimates and cash limits for manpoweradministrative expenditure, and to the extent that, as the CommitteeSieves, cash control gives special leverage, the CSD has thatWerage and uses it.    It is however an over-simplification to say^Paragraph 122) that the central department responsible for the over-8lSht of efficiency should have the power to enforce its proposals,Aether these arise on     matters within the responsibility of theC^ or the Treasury, regardless of the views0f the Departmental Minister.   Under our system of government, majordisagreements between departments can only be settled by ministers collectively.   There is always,therefore, an element of shared decision-.v?king in central-departmental relationships.CONFIDENTIAL
67. The Government agree   with the Committee, however, that strong and effective management services (MS) and staff inspection (Si)are necessary, both centrally and in departments.    Both MS and Si &amp;aVegreatly strengthened in recent years, and the Committee&apos;s Reporttends to underestimate their effectiveness.    Two important questionsbeen raised by the Committee: the authority of MS and SI staff and tkebest method of deploying them.68. The Government agree   that both functions should be staffedby officers of high quality, and that there should be recognisedprocedures for ensuring full consideration of their findings whichshould carry considerable weight.   Attention should also be paid to full and speedy implementation once decisions have been taken after discussion with the Staff Side.    The final decisions, .;here both Siand MS recommendations are concerned, lie with top management; andiin practice, the great majority of recommendations are implemented&apos;69. Central staff inspectors have a well-established and constantexercised right of access to all departments as part of CSDfs manp0control function.   As regards central MS staff, the letter sent to every Accounting Officer when he takes up appointment says thatCSD is responsible for &quot;the overall efficiency of the public serVfor the development of management services throughout the publicservice;    for taking the initiative in the introduction of newment techniques, and for keeping an oversight over the managementDractice in all the departments&quot;.    Consistent     with this stateffieDGo*ecentral MS staff are never refused access to departments and thement agree they should always have it.    Apart from the managemen
Review programme, they have in practice operated mainly by invitationand agreement, but increasingly they too are used in support of manpower control.   The Government will consider the scope for taking this development further.   Departmental SI and MS units normallyhave access to the full range of departmental operations under theauthority of the Principal Establishment Officer.?Q.   The best deployment of SI and MS units depends upon the job tobe done.   Recent improvements have produced a regular cyclical programmeof SI aimed at covering the whole of the non-industrial Civil Serviceabout every 3 years, using sampling methods in appropriate areas.l1s looks more deeply at the underlying organisation and methods of work,a typical MS assignment takes longer than a staff inspectionBering a corresponding area;    it therefore is, and nhould be, moreElective in its coverage, and it will often be profitable to deploy1*8 staff by agreement with, or at the suggestion of, the line managerConcerned.   Joint working between MS staff and staff inspectors canWever be useful, and a joint approach is adopted where management**ob.lems call for it.   Moreover, it is important, as the CommitteeSlied, that staff inspectors and MS staff should be organised as aCerent arm of management, both centrally and departmentally, and5hould wopk in Very close co-operation,.by pooling experience and byalerting each other to problems which need attention, whether in joint0* separate assignments.   Current organisation normally reflects this&amp;ihciple.   There is, however, room for improvement in promoting co-nation and joint working;   and the Government intend to pursue this.X 5pnnicincMT? ah
CHAPTER XI: INCENTIVESRecommendation (37)* &quot;Productivity indices should bepublished,ii....71.    Costing and measurement systems are in widespread use in theCivil Service.    These systems do not conform to a single pattern sincmanagerial requirements vary in different areas of activity.72*    The productivity indices prepared by the US Federal Government(referred to in paragraph 129 of the Committee^ Report) do not pnrP0to be accurate measures of management or staff efficiency as sucn*are primarily of value as trend indicators.    Even for this purpose*however, such indices need to be interpreted with extreme care; arl(*in examining performance and productivity, important questions of quality and of effectiveness fall to be considered.    The use of caselected performance measures can clearly be valuable in indicatingexperienced managers those areas of activity which call for moresearching appraisal and, possibly, corrective action:    it is imp^however, to keep their limitations in mind.73*    The type of cost and measurement system to which the Commit66drawn attention is most relevant to manpower intensive areas (eg s0Csecurity payment;    certain kinds of tax collection) where there aresystems for collection and evaluation of management statistics whicJlenable departments to monitor output on a regular basis.    In these areas, work is commonly costed in manpower terms and staff employ6are closely related to the identified v/ork load.74.   While the detailed management of programme is a matter for operational departments, the Government agree that central departsXI 1^_ TnWCinPMTJAI

(paragraph 50)lJle Government will, as stated above /   - , to be glad to consider anySu2gestions the Committee has for the provision of items of managerial^formation to Parliament.   The Government do not believe, however, thatthe production and publication of comprehensive and linked series of productivity indices would justify their cost.Recommendation (37):   &quot;..... and more research should or be done into the possible relating of pay andpromotion to performance.&quot;Recommendation (38): &quot;The United States system ofspeeding up or withholding of increments should beintroduced as soon as possible.&quot;e&apos;11&apos;&quot; ?5.   The Government accept   that further research is desirable on these to   ^ssueg        when pay policy allows propose   to discuss with the unions,fith whom any changes would need to be negotiated, what research mightt bfl&quot;&apos;    e mounted into the effectiveness of flexible pay systems as a means of^proving performance in the Civil Service.    The possibility of relating^av to performance has been considered from time to time in the past inv      -umber of guises, including &quot;merit pay, Recognition grants&apos;, flongia   8ervice. increments1 and &apos;flexible increments&apos; ( the additional increments^ / in each ofcelerated in relation to performance).    The common theme/these is that paybe more closely related to the individual and what he doesle &quot;the rate for the man&quot; as against &quot;the rate for the job&quot;.   The &quot;rate*0tv the job&quot; is the underlying principle of Civil Service pay, and the^ f Side have been opposed to any change in this principle. The resourceiir. of-Plications/relating pay to performance, particularly any system which^Voiyes appeal arrangements of the kind recommended by the Committee,pose problems, and will be a feature the Government will want to*Plore in any research programme.XI 2.....___CflfUFinFMTuu.
CHAPTER 211:     RELATIONS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTRecommendation (39)*    &quot;A small joint body of senior civilservants and senior local authority chief executives should review relations between the civil service and the localgovernment service and consideration should be given to thisjoint body continuing in being.&quot;76.    The Government agree   with the Committee that relations between central and local government need to be kept underbut not on the machinery for achieving this end.77*    This recommendation stems from evidence submitted by the society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE)*   The Committee did no evidence from the local Authority Associations ; and, perhaps becathis, the recommendation does not reflect one key point about the relationship between central and local government, which is thatcore of the relationship is political.   Local government officerscouncillors, who are answerable to their electors;    civil servantsserve Ministers, who are answerable to Parliament.78.    Although there is everything to be said for close contacts between Chief Executives, other chief officers and .senior civilservants - for which there are already many opportunities - thement    do   not think that a joint body of civil servants and Chie-Executives would be the best instrument to review centraVloca^relations.   There is much more merit in SOLACE1s third recommen1quoted in paragraph 134- of the report, that the Consultative Counc1on Local Government Finance should be developed into a forum for considering the roles of central and local government.   The Consative Council is chaired by the Secretary of State for the Envirand has a membership which includes both Departmental Ministersdati&apos;n&apos;XII 1CONFIDENTIAL4

A*elsh Consultative Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Vales,constitutes a separate forum for the discussion of matters ofParticular interest to V/ales.I in fact, there have already been discussions with local governmentQu the theme of central/local relations, following the Layfield Report0U Local Government Finance and the Government1s Green Paper (Cmnd 6813)Published in May 1977*   And it is proposed, as stated in the Greeni Aaper, to examine with the local authority Associations ways in whichthe Consultative Council and its subsidiary committees can most usefully be developed to facilitate co-operation between central and localgovernment.    In the Government&apos;s view, therefore, the Council is bestQuipped to provide the continuing forum for assessing the central/localNations recommended by the Committee.   This view is shared by the^cal Authority Associations, who have been consulted on this mattero8o*   In Scotland, where the Secretary of State has Ministerial*esPonsibility for practically all local authority functions, and where^e Convention of Scottish Local Authorities represents all types of authorities, regular meetings between the Secretary of State and^Presentatives of the Convention are heid for purposes similar to those0f the Consultative Council.   Within this framework,senior officials0f the Scottish Office and Chief Executives of local authorities meet**om time to time to discuss matters of common interest;   but it ismeetings between the Secretary of State and the Convention which provide the forum for keeping under review relations between central^ local government.   This is consistent with the recommendations forin the Layfield Report and with the Government1s Green Paperonkocal Government Finance in Scotland (Cmnd 6811).XII 2rniucirinuTiA&apos;

It should also be noted that most day-to-day relations between central and local government will continue to be conducted through a variety of channels which are already well-established, includingthe various regional offices of central government.Recommendation (40):    &quot;The new system for capitalexpenditure approvals proposed by the Government inits recent Green Paper, should not require approvalof individual projects within an approved programme,unless the project is so large as to be completelyunusual.&quot;82.

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER XIII:    MINISTERS AND CIVIL SERVANTSRecommendation (41):    &quot;Ministers should normally, afterdue consultation, be able to carry out changes in themanagement of their Departments, the ultimate responsibilityof the Prime Minister and the Head of the Civil Serviceonly being invoked in exceptional circumstances.&quot;Recommendation (42):    &quot;Special advisers brought in by ministers should become an accepted feature of admin-istration and should not be limited to two per cabinet minister.   A Minister should be free to adopt any organisation he thinks fit for the efficient dischargeof business, including a group of advisers, or evenbackbench MPs, without executive authority in the Depart-ment.&quot;$3*    Within the framework of the collective responsibility of theCabinet as a whole, the Minister in charge of a Department is responsible^o Parliament for its policies&quot;, its organisation and its management.?ke staff of a department are Crown servants, the conditions of whoseemployment are governed by many factors, some a matter of law, some*0r*g established conventions and practical arrangements, endorsed eithere*Plicitly or implicitly by successive governments.   Paragraph 143 of0ke Committee&apos;s Report attributes to civil servants powers which they^0 not have;    it also detracts from the role of the Prime Minister,-^he Prime Minister decides senior appointments and machinery ofGovernment questions himself, after consultation as appropriate with hisColleagues and the Head of the Home Civil Service.Soi*e major questions (eg the hiving off. of bodies or the creating of&apos;ev/ ones and pay policy) are normally decided by Ministers collectively.Elective Cabinet authority also governs the expenditure limits andEffing controls which are exercised by the Central Departments andto v/hich the Committee rightly attaches importance.   None of these are^ters on which civil servants take the final decisions, although their^vice will normally be sought when appropriate.
\84-.    V/ithin this general framework, the Minister and his permanent secretary work together in running the affairs of the department.By long-established agreement between all political parties thatthe Civil Service should be a non-political, permanent, careerService, Ministers delegate to their Permanent Secretaries the managing and career development of departmental staff.   The Perfl-anent Secretaries in turn operate within a structure of rules an-guidelines, including conditions of service, which are centrallyprescribed and many of which have resulted from negotiation witnStaff Sides.    For a very few functions, a total independence fr0l!1Ministerial control has been laid down, for example, in order toprevent patronage, the functions of the Civil Service Commissi00-f- *nin selecting and certifying persons for permanent appointmentpractice, Ministers find it necessary for the effective runningdepartments to delegate authority to a series of management leve^-Generally speaking the organisation is tried and tested over aperiod but it is open to the Minister to make changes if he iwith the concurrence of the Treasury or the CSD if there aref i^cien *and economic implications on the one hand, or manpower and ei*implications on the other, and it is the general practicethat the Permanent Secretary consults his Minister about all maof major importance, whether of organisation or staffing.

Theinitiative normally lies with him and in this sense neither he northe Prime Minister is invoked by departments but Ministers incharge of departments are always consulted about such appointmentsin their departments.    The CSD, of which he is the permanent secretary, is responsibile for agreeing the establishment votes of departments, and for seeing that general rules of guidance,including mandatory terms and conditions of service, are observed.86.    The Government agree that special advisers should become an accepted feature of administration.    They work directly to theMinister, and are not career civil servants.     The working rule of the present Administration is that Cabinet Ministers should normally appoint no more than two special advisers, but this rule is not immutable.Recommendation (43):    &quot;Ministers should be paid at thelevel determined by the Top Salaries Review Body.&quot;87.    The Government take note that the Committee recommended that ministers should be paid at the level determined by the top salaries Review Body.XIII confidential
Recommendation (44):-   &quot;The Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition should jointly consider the presentrule that no Administration sees the papers of its predecessor of a different party, to decide whether somemutually agreed relaxation of the rule might not be advantageous to Ministers of successive Governments.&quot;88. The present rule about access to papers of a previous Admin-istration has long been accepted by successive Governments. 1* lSdesigned to ensure that Ministers of an incoming Administration donot see the Cabinet papers of their predecessors of a differentParty, or any papers indicating the views of those predecessors of the  advice they received from their official advisers.89*     On the other hand the rule recognises that the national interrequires some continuity of policy (particularly, for example, infield of foreign affairs) and that an incoming Administration haslegitimate right to factual information in their Departments oralindeed to any other information unless this relates to the interdeliberations of a previous Administration of a different poli^i0^complexion.   The Government is not aware of any evidence that &quot;theoperation of the rule has given rise to difficulties in practice,nor does it believe that the rule &quot;increases the power of the Ci &quot;Service relative to Ministers&quot;.90.     The Government has therefore concluded that the present rule should continue.8*XIII confidential
CHAPTER XIV:    PARLIAMENTARY SURVEILLANCEAUDITRecommendation (45):    &quot;Our system of public audit is out of date and the Exchequer &amp; Audit Department Actsshould be amended and should state as a principle thatthe E &amp; AD may audit any accounts into which public money goes even if such public money is not the bulkof receipts into such accounts.    Where public money isthe bulk of receipts into an account, the E &amp; AD should always audit them, subject only to such specific exceptionsas are made in the amended Act.&quot;91.    If the Committeefs recommendation were adopted without qualification,,eSt Comptroller and Auditor General could take over the audit of localandauthorities, nationalised industries,/other public bodies engaged inderations of a commercial nature, as well as a large number of private sector bodies and companies to which the Government providesI      distance.   The Government do     not agree that such an extension of*be Comptroller and Auditor General&apos;s audit would be sensible. Localauthority audit is dealt with in the reply to recommendation 46.the case of the nationalised industries, the Government believe thattue main question is whether the auditors appointed in accordance withCl*rent statutes possess the professional skill and experience in commercial accounting as well as the independent status for their task;a*d that the answer to this question is -yes&apos;.

It might be suggested that whatever may be the decisionon the extent to which the C &amp; AG should audit the accounts ofvarious bodies receiving public funds, he should -be empowered to have access to the books and records of allrecipients of public funds for the purpose of any specificenquiry.   The Government recognise that to ensure an adequatedegree of accountability to Parliament there may be circumstancewhere it would be appropriate to afford the C &amp; AG access to t&amp;ebooks and records of such bodies.    But the Government doubt whether it would be possible to define in advance the circin which a specific right of access for the C &amp; AG would be appropriate and how it might be secured, and they considereach case must be judged on its merits.    In reaching a decisionon such cases the Government would seek the views of the Comfl1of Public Accounts and of the Comptroller and Auditor General&apos;Recommendation (46):    &quot;The Comptroller and AuditorGeneral should take over responsibility for theDistrict Audit from the DOE.&quot;umstan93.      The Government do not believe it would be right to accept this recommendation.    The District Auditor has a statutoryindependance and the Secretary of State for the Environmenthas no power to influence him in the execution of his duties&apos;      I *94-.     There is no evidence that the independence of the DistrAudit from the Executive is not secured under the present sv^&apos; IUnlike most   civil servants,who carry out duties assigned *0- c **** Iby Ministers, a district auditor is responsible for dutiesiidance $are laid directly on him by Act of Parliament.

95. The Committee did not take evidence from the Government, the comptroller and Auditor General or the Local Authority Associationson this issue, which has serious implications for central and localgovernment.   The Government had already given consideration tosuch issues in the preparation of its response to the Report of theLayfield Committee which was published as a Green Paper in May 1977(Cmnd 6815).    The Local Authority Associations had also commentedupon that Report.96. Changing the responsibility for the District Audit would have very important constitutional implications, a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons takes evidence on the reports of the C &amp; AG.&amp;Ut local authorities are statutory autonomous bodies who areResponsible not to Parliament but to their own ratepayers and electors.powers and duties of local authorities are laid upon them by statute,&amp;Hd it is they and not Ministers who are answerable for how theyZeroise those powers and carry out those dutieB.    The change proposed*ould therefore involve a radical shift in the relationship between0entral and local government, with ramifications much wider thanarrangeraents for audit.    In this context the Committee may wish to note that the Local Authority Associations have reacted strongly to theProposals in the Report, which they believe would represent a substantialderogation of the autonomous powers of their constituent authorities.57.   in the Government1s view, a better way to help secure efficiencyllA local government, which would not derogate from the autonomy of*Qcal authorities, is that proposed in the Green Paper (Cmnd 6813).^is recognises that the responsibility for getting value for money inprovision of local services must remain primarily with the local^thorities themselves.   Nevertheless, the Government believe thatXIV confidential
CONFIDENTIALthere would be real advantages in establishing a new advisory body onaudit which would consider general questions relating to efficiency ^value for money in local authorities.    The Government are satisfied th&amp;the proposed institution should be able to work independently and see no reason why   its    reports should not attract a full measure of Pu^attention.Recommendation (47):    &quot;The E &amp; AD should be empoweredto conduct audits of the management efficiency and effectiveness of all that it audits financially.&quot;98.    The Government welcome   the intention of the Comptroller &amp; AU1General to develop further his operations in the fields of efficiency and value for money, while recognising that this shouldnot take him into policy considerations for which only ministersanswer to Parliament.    The Exchequer &amp; Audit Department Acts donot preclude him from operating in a wider way beyond financialaudit and he has been doing so for some time.    If for example i*appeared as a result of financial audit that expenditure had notbeen cost effective because of shortcomings in management, the comptroller &amp; Auditor General would make reference to this inreports.   Moreover, if he considered that the expenditure althouSproperly committed in terms of an agreed policy, was greater 11it:t.stated \$Thad been estimated, or that it was failing to meet the objective, or that the objective was being met more slowly thanbeen reported to Parliament, that too could become a subjectreport.XIV confidential&amp;1
Recommendation (48):    &quot;The   &amp; AD should change itsrecruitment policy to provide staff capable ofcarrying out these extended audits.&quot;99.    The Government recognise the importance of having a thorough and effective audit service.   Recruitment and training policieshave been changed significantly during the last few years.   And,asthe task of the Exchequer and Audit Department develops, the recruitment policy and staffing of the Department will be kept under continuous review to ensure that it is always appropriately staffedto carry out its task.Recommendation (49):    &quot;The relevant Select Committee of theHouse of Commons (at the present time the Public accounts committee) should be consulted about the appointment of future Comptrollers and Auditors General and other possiblesources of recruitment than the Treasury should be considered.&quot;100.   The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the Sovereignby Letters Patent.   The Prime Minister advises Her Majesty on theappointment and, before doing so, consults the Head of the Home CivilService.   The Governments view is that the best-fitted availableperson, from whatever source, should be appointed.To take account of the Expenditure Committee1s recommendation,the prime Minister intends to arrange, v/hen next the post comes to bethat the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee should be consulted about the experience and qualities desirable in candidatesjnames the Chairman wishes to recommend at that stage will be takenin*o consideration.   At a later stage the Chairman will be shown the*hort list of 2 or 3 names from which the Prime Minister intends toNcq his recommendation to The Queen, and subsequently, before the^ouncement is made, the Chairman will be given in confidence theof the person selected.   Such an arrangement must, however, be^0&apos;ect to the wishes of the Prime Minister of the day, and in givingfinal advice to the Queen he would, in any event, retain a real^etoent of choice.
102. Consultation on these lines is similar to the procedures theGovernment intend,  to adopt when next the appointment of parliamentary commissioner for Administration is made.    This has already been anno(Cmnd 6764), and the Select Committee on the Parliamentary commission,for Administration has   been glad to note it in its Second Reportfor the 1976-77 Session (HC 534).PARLIAMENTARY STAFFRecommendation (50):    &quot;The proposed new House ofCommons Commission should discharge in relation tothe services of the House   the functions discharged by the Treasury in relation to other Estimates,&quot;103. The Government accept   the Committee9s recommendation that *be P1&quot;0^new House of Commons Commission should exercise the role now discha^eby Treasury Ministers in relation to expenditure on the servicesstaff of the House.   This change will be incorporated in legislation which will be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time is availableto implement the recommendations of the Committee under the chain of Mr Arthur Bottomley, MP, which made proposals in 1975 for theadministration of the House of Commons under the new Commission,Recommendation (51):    &quot;The C &amp; AG and the staff of theE&amp;AD should be placed under the House of CommonsCommission and thus become Parliamentary staff so thatit will become clear that they should initiateenquiries if so requested by the House or one of its committees,&quot;104. The Government consider   it to be of cardinal importance &quot;taaComptroller &amp; Auditor General should not be subject to directionsany quarter in the exercise of the duties laid on him by statuteto
undertake an effective audit and scrutiny of the expenditure of theExecutive.    He and his staff are, and should remain, in a differentPosition from that of the staff of Parliament.   The Government donot   accept, therefore, that the legislation referred to in paragraph 103*bove should alter the status -of the C &amp; AG and his staff.PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEESRecommendation (52):    &quot;A comprehensive set ofSelect Committees specifically related to theDepartments of state should be set up with adequatesupporting specialist staff.&quot;Recommendation (53):   &quot;These Select Committees shouldbe required to consider appropriations of expenditurein detail thus enabling the House to regain control ofthe process of appropriating expenditure.&quot;*0,r-.     The Expenditure Committee recommendations would involve a fundamental change in our parliamentary system and in the relationship between the Executive and Parliament.    The Terms of Reference of theSeneral review currently being undertaken by the House of CommonsSelect Committee on Procedure include consideration of the futurestructure of the House select committee system and its methods offorking.    That Committee will no doubt have noted .the ExpenditureCommittee1s recommendations on these subjects.^06.     The Government propose, therefore, to defer any observations0h the Expenditure Committee^ recommendations until the views of theSelect Committee on Procedure are available.XIV confidential
CONFIDENTIAlAPPENDIXRECOMMENDATION 54V/e recommend that an agreed definition of civil servant whichwould continue to be applicable irrespective of such changes inorganisational structure should be worked out jointly by the CSDand our General Sub-Committee.107.The Committee is concerned that there should be a clear andconsistent basis for the Civil Service manpower count.     There isin law no universally applicable definition of &quot;civil servant&quot;or &quot;Civil Service&quot;.     The most important distinguishing characteristis service on behalf of the Crown.     The employees of bodies which do not in law have Crown status (eg local authorities; nationalised industries) are not civil servants.     Political, judicial andother Crown office holders whose terms and conditions of service are separately provided for are distinguished from civil servantsas are the Armed Forces and the Royal Household.108. The Committee has been primarily concerned with the home civil Service.     Its members staff all the main UK GovernmentDepartments under the direct control of Ministers (although theFCO is mainly staffed by the Diplomatic Service) and a number ofnon-Ministerial Departments and Crown bodies.       Its terms andconditions are governed by the Minister for the Civil Service under&quot;the provisions of the Civil Service Order in Council 1969.     It is&quot;the Home Civil Service, together with the Diplomatic Service, which&quot;the published Civil Service manpower count covers.APPENDIX confidential
109. Since service on behalf of the Crown is a fundamentalcharacteristic of a civil servant, if the status of a body isaltered from Crown to non-Crown ( or vice versa) the status of-p&apos;Fec*its staff will automatically be altered too.     Ignoring theof such changes would remove any consistent basis for a CivilService manpower count as it would come to include some who werenot civil servants and exclude some who were.     The government consider   it preferable to maintain the present basis of thecount making clear at the time the effects of any organisationalchanges.110.
