DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIESJULY - DECEMBER 1977Section I. introduction. In accordance with the recommendation of the Select Committee on european Community Secondary Legislation in its second report of the 1972-73session, the Government has presented a regular series of six-monthly reports to Parliament describing major developments in the European Community.The report on the United Kingdom Presidency of the Council of Ministers inthe first six months of 1977 gave a special assessment of developments in thevarious Councils chaired by British Ministers. The present report gives a factualaccount of the period of the Belgian Presidency from 1 July to 31 December1977 in accordance with the form of previous reports. A few main themes are however identified in the introduction.2. In the second half of 1977 the major preoccupation of the Communitycontinued to be the interrelated problems of growth, inflation and unemploy-ment. Following their invitation to the European Investment Bank to increase its capital, the European Council agreed in principle in December that theCommission should raise a loan of 1,000 million European Units of Account to stimulate investment. Close attention was given toward the end of the yearto two industries in particular difficulty: steel and textiles. Special measures were agreed to protect the Community steel industry from cheap imports andto encourage restructuring; and the successful negotiation by the Commissionof bilateral agreements limiting textile imports from the principal supplying countries enabled the Community to agree to the renewal of the Multi-FibreArrangement.3. Elsewhere the Community continued to expand its network of relation-ships. Discussions with the United States and other trading partners have set the scene for the main bargaining phase of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations.The ground was also prepared for negotiations in the first part of 1978 for a trade agreement with China. The Euro-Arab Dialogue continued.4. The Community continued preparations for enlargement. The Spanishapplication for Community membership was received in July and the Commis-sion are working on their Opinions on both the Spanish and Portugueseapplications. Detailed discussions were held with the Greek Government on matters arising from their application.5. Progress was made on several internal Community issues. Of particularconcern to the United Kingdom were the agreement to locate at Culham inOxfordshire the Research Centre for the Joint European Torus; the agreement on how Article 131 of the Treaty of Accession, which governs the contributions of the UK and other new member states to the Community budget in 1978 and79, should be applied after the introduction of the European Unit of Account;and agreement on the phased implementation of shorter drivers&apos; hours for domestic road passenger and goods traffic over 3 years from 1 January 1978.The UK also welcomed the agreement that the next Regional Fund should beof substantial size. The new Community Court of Auditors began its work inNovember.
6. The British Parliament continued its close scrutiny of European Com-munity legislation and the Government undertook to examine ways to improveParliamentary control. Parliament began its debate on the Governments Billto provide for direct elections to the European Assembly; and the House ofCommons voted on 13 December in favour of retaining the simple majorityelectoral system. Further consideration of the May/June target date for directelections will be required in the Community.Section II.  Political Co-operation7. The nine member states have continued to discuss a wide range of foreignpolicy issues and to seek common positions where possible. In particular theyhave co-ordinated their positions in the follow-up to the Conference on security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The Nine have worked closely togetherduring the Belgrade CSCE follow-up meeting. The comments they have made during the exchange of views on implementation of the CSCE Final Act havebeen carefully co-ordinated, and they have together co-sponsored a number of proposals aimed at improving implementation of the Final Act.8. The Nine have adopted a common approach to the problems of africa and the Middle East. A joint Declaration was made by the Foreign ministers on 22 November expressing the hope that President Sadafs initiative in goingto Jerusalem would lead on to a comprehensive peace settlement.9. As part of the policy of using their links with South Africa to promotepeaceful and constructive changes, the Foreign Ministers on 20 Septemberagreed on the text of a Code of Conduct on Employment Practices for companies of the nine member states with affiliates there. The Code seeks to promoteimproved employment practices for all employees irrespective of racial or otherdistinction. It has been brought to the attention of the Governments of otherOECD countries in the hope that they will adopt it or similar guidelines.Further, in support of the cause of human rights in South Africa, the BelgianAmbassador at Pretoria made a demarche on behalf of the Nine expressingstrong concern at the detentions and bannings carried out by the authorities on19 October. The Nine have also made clear their intention not to recogniseBophutatswana.10. Human rights issues in other parts of the world also remain a majorconcern of the Nine and have featured prominently in their discussions ofUnited Nations and CSCE matters.11. Foreign Ministers have agreed on procedures for improved co-ordinationat the United Nations. Preparations were made at an early stage for the 32ndGeneral Assembly, and the Nine have made a practice of regular and thoroughconsultation on United Nations topics. The incidence of common votes by the nine in the General Assembly remained high.12. Another area of active co-operation among the Nine has been the Euro-Arab Dialogue. Further progress has been made in strengthening the Nine&apos;relations with the Arab World. As a result of decisions taken at the thirdmeeting of the General Committee in Brussels on 26-28 October, jointly-financedpractical co-operation projects can now proceed after two years of discussions.Experts continue to exchange views on a wide range of economic matters.
Section III.   External Relations: Trade and AidGATT Trade Negotiations13. The Community continues to play an important and constructive role in the GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTNs). Following the politicalcommitment at the Downing Street Economic Summit in May to achievesubstantive progress in key areas of the negotiations tariffs, non-tariffmeasures and agriculture work has been going on with the objective oftabling early in 1978 an offer on tariff reductions and texts of various codesincluding codes on standards, customs valuation, Government procurementand subsidies and countervailing levies. In parallel with this, the possibilityhas been examined of modifying the present procedures on safeguard actionso that corrective action might in certain circumstances be taken againstdisruptive imports from the source causing the disruption rather than acrossthe board. Work has continued on agriculture in parallel with the negotiations in other areas.14. All this work will form the basis for the substantive negotiations. Asbetween developed countries these negotiations will be conducted on the basisof strict reciprocity. In accordance with the terms of the 1973 TokyoDeclaration, every effort will be made to ensure that the agreements providespecial benefits for developing countries, and especially for the least developedamong them.Textiles15. The GATT Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) and the Community&apos;sfourteen bilateral restraint agreements under the framework of the MFAexpired on 31 December. The Council agreed on 20 December that the Com-munity should renew the MFA. The Council also approved the terms of thenew bilateral agreements negotiated with 31 supplier countries which will now be finalised. The new agreements will provide a greater degree of protec-tion against disruptive low-cost imports than the agreements which have nowexpired. The main features are: overall limits on the eight most sensitiveproducts (cotton yarn, cotton cloth, synthetic cloth, knitted shirts, jerseys,trousers, woven blouses and woven shirts); more quotas with lower growthrates on other products; automatic safeguard mechanism to bring new sources of disruption under control. The Community&apos;s application of the MFA tothose countries is dependent on the signature of these agreements.Generalised Scheme of Preferences16. The Commission^ proposals for the Community&apos;s Scheme ofGeneralised Preferences which provides preferential access for developing countries to e.c. markets was approved by the Council in November 1977.The proposals provide for improved concessions, including increased tariffquotas and ceiling limits for the most sensitive items eg footwear, iron andsteel. A number of new agricultural products were added to the scheme. Theleast developed group of countries have been given especially favourable treatment. For textiles, the arrangements for 1977 will be carried forward forthe first six months of 1978.
Japan17. The Community has continued its efforts to develop a closer relation-ship with Japan and to resolve the current trading problems. On 12-14October the President of the Commission visited Japan where he had discussions with Japanese ministers. The regular e.c./Japan high level consultationswere held in Brussels on 1-2 December to discuss current trade and economic problems. Relations with Japan were discussed by the European council at its meeting on 5-6 December, when it called upon the President of theCommission to continue and intensify his consultations with the JapaneseGovernment. Later in the month, Mr. Jenkins met Mr. Ushiba, Japan&apos;s Ministerfor External Economic Affairs, who was visiting Brussels and Washingtonfor further talks.United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)18. There was continuing consultation in the Community on its position for the resumed UNCTAD Common Fund Negotiating Conference whichwas held from 7 November until 1 December. In October, the Council agree the Community&apos;s opening position for discussion with the other industrialised countries and with the developing countries. At a November Council, member states took stock of developments at the Common Fund Conference, whichwas suspended at the request of the developing countries.Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)19. The first meeting in the Dialogue between the European community and ASEAN took place in Brussels on 29 November. In the course of thediscussion a number of matters covering trade and development were considered.China20. A Commission Delegation visited China in July 1977 to discuss thepossibility of a trade agreement with the Community. In November theCouncil agreed a mandate for the Commission to conduct negotiations, which began in Brussels in December.Yugoslavia21. The present Trade Agreement with Yugoslavia expires in August 1978.The Commission have discussed with the Yugoslavs the possible scope of anew agreement. The Council discussed in December a mandate for the negotia-tions, which are due to begin early in 1978.State Trading Countries22. At a meeting between the e.c. and the Council of Mutual economic assistance (CMEA) delegations in Brussels on 21 September, agreement was reached to enter into negotiations in the first half of 1978. This represented the culmination of a long series of exchanges beginning with the Community&apos;first approach in 1974 and should lead to closer working relationships betweenthe members of the two organisations.
Conference on International Economic Co-operation (CIEC)23. The outcome of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation(CIEC) was discussed at the 31st Resumed Session of the United nations general Assembly on 13-19 September. The Community had prepared its position at the Foreign Affairs Council in July. The General Assembly was unable to agree on an assessment of the CIEC and the Session concluded by taking note of this failure.Lome Convention24. A meeting of the Joint Committee of the ACP/e.c. consultative assembly was held in Lesotho from 28 November to 1 December. The Com-mittee reviewed current progress in the implementation of the Lome Con-vention; and passed a resolution on the situation in Southern Africa urgingall Lome signatories to assist liberation movements.25. The Republic of Jibuti, following its independence on 27 June 1977,applied to accede to the Lome Convention on 7 July. The ACP approved therequest at their Ministerial Council meeting in Lusaka in December. TheCommunity has given its agreement.Mediterranean26. Additional protocols to the Association Agreements with Malta and cyprus were signed during this period and the new arrangements will take effect early in 1978. A new financial protocol to the Cyprus agreement wasalso negotiated, and negotiations opened on a new set of arrangements forCyprus&apos; agricultural exports. The existing e.c./Spain trade agreement hasbeen applied to trade between Spain and the three new member states since1 July, subject to certain technical adjustments and transitional arrangements on horticulture. Agreement has been reached on a mandate to revise andupdate the agreement with Spain.Enlargement27. In July, the Spanish Government submitted an application for Com-munity membership. The Council in September acknowledged receipt of theapplication and asked the Commission to begin work, in close consultation withthe member states and Spain, on the Opinion required under Article 237 of theTreaty of Rome. The Commission are also working on the required Opinion onPortuguese accession. Meetings of the e.c./Greece Negotiating Conference at ministerial level were held on 17 October and 19 December. Meetings atAmbassadorial level were held at monthly intervals. These meetings have continued to be devoted to exchanges of positions and information on particulareconomic sectors, in preparation for substantive negotiations.Latin America28. The Dialogue with the Latin American countries was continued with thesecond biennial session held in Brussels in December.Aid for Non-associated Developing Countries29. The Council on 28 November made progress on several issues. agreement was reached on a programme for the expenditure of 45 million European Units
of Account (MEUA) in the 1977 budget. The Council gave the Commission anumber of guidelines for the 1978 programme and agreed in principle that regulation to govern aid to non-associates on a more lasting basis should beintroduced, if possible in time for the 1978 budget.Section IV.  Agriculture and FisheriesMonetary Arrangements30. In November the Commission put forward revised proposals for reducinggradually Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) by adjustments to greenrates. It was proposed that existing MCAs should be removed by equal stagesover the next seven years. In addition the annual adjustments should eliminateMCAs created by currency movements between price settlements subject to amaximum compulsory green rate change on 5 per cent. The Commission alsopresented a report on the use of the European Unit of Account (EUA) abasket unit of all Community currencies (see paragraph 53) in the common agricultural Policy in place of the European Monetary Unit of Account (EMUA)which is based only on the currencies in the &quot;snake&quot;. This report concluded that,while in principle the EUA would be the right unit to use, the implications of thechange needed further study before a formal proposal to introduce it into the cap was made. No decision has been reached on phasing out MCAs, nor havethe Commission yet decided whether to make a formal proposal on the EUA.The Commission is preparing a report on the economic and social conse-quences of the MRCA system.31. At the Council on 13 September, a proposal to devalue the green kroneby 5 per cent was accepted and at its meeting in December the Council agreedupon a 2\ per cent devaluation of the French green franc.Beef and Veal32. In October the Commission published a report on the relative merits of beef premiums and intervention. It has yet to be discussed in depth by theCouncil.33. At its November meeting the Council agreed to extend for 1978 arrange-ments allowing the import of beef from ACP countries at reduced rates of importlevy. The Council agreed in December to modify the import arrangements forbeef from Yugoslavia to allow preferential access at times when Communityimport levies are operating at a high level.New Zealand Butter and Cheese34. At the September Council the prices paid to New Zealand for imports of butter and cheese under the special terms of Protocol 18 were increased, with effect from 1 October 1977. These changes will not affect retail prices in theUnited Kingdom.Animal Health35. The Council agreed in December on the conditions under which Com-munity aid will be given to accelerated national programmes for the eradicationof certain cattle diseases, and on a proposal to permit the continued use ofcertain immersion-chilling processes for poultry meat. It also agreed that the
three new member states should be allowed to maintain for a further year their national rules for declaring cattle herds free of brucellosis and tuberculosis andon protection against swine fever.Pure-bred Breeding Cattle36. At its meeting in July the Council adopted a directive which facilitates themovement of pure-bred breeding cattle with the Community. At the same time they agreed to set up a Standing Committee on Zootechnics which will be concerned with the detailed implementation of this Directive and those thatmay follow in respect of other species.Sugar37. At the United Nations Sugar Conference in Geneva which ended on 7October, the Community indicated its willingness to join the new InternationalSugar Agreement on terms to be negotiated. The text of the new Agreement,which came into force on 1 January 1978, contains a provision under which theCommunity could so accede.Mediterranean Agriculture38. The Council has begun an examination of the problems of the Mediter-ranean areas of the Community. Detailed proposals for a number of measures,including structural assistance for Mediterranean agriculture and a revisedolive oil regime, have been made by the Commission and will be considered further in 1978.Apples39. Because of the shortfall in this year&apos;s Community crop the Councilagreed on 7 November a reduction of the tariff on fresh apples from third countries from 13 November to 31 January 1978. The need for a continuation ofthis reduction will be reviewed by the Council.Wine40. The Council adopted certain technical amendments to the wine regime.In view of the bad weather in 1977 they agreed measures of assistance to pro-producer member states particularly adversely affected.Fisheries41. During October the Commission produced further proposals on theinternal regime: quotas for 1978, conservation measures, control and enforce-ment and structural measures. These were discussed at two Fisheries Councilson 24-25 October and 5-7 December. Ministers could not reach agreement and agreed to meet again on 16 January 1978 to resume their deliberations. these measures (other than the structural measures) were debated in the House ofCommons on 28 November 1977.42. On specific measures, the Council adopted in July quotas for herringfishing in waters to the west of Scotland and the Irish Sea and agreed a ban onherring fishing in the Bristol Channel and Western English Channel until theend of the year. It was also agreed that a Community ban should be re-imposed
on fishing for herring in the North Sea, replacing the United Kingdom nationalmeasure which operated in United Kingdom fisheries limits during July. Theban was later extended to the end of the year with a small derogation for someFrench local fishermen during November and December.43. A ban on fishing for Norway pout in an area to the north-east ofScotland was agreed by the Council for the period 1 September to 15 October;following the failure of the Council to agree on its renewal, it was introducedthereafter as a United Kingdom national measure.44. On the external side the Community has continued negotiations forfisheries agreements with a number of non-Member States, but in the absence ofagreement on most aspects of the internal regime, it was necessary to continue togrant quotas to non-Member States for periods of a few months at a time.Following the imposition of severe restrictions on Community fishing in theSoviet sector of the Barents Sea the Council declined to roll forward quotas forSoviet fishing in Member States&apos; waters beyond the end of September. Atpresent, vessels of Community states are not fishing in Soviet waters and Sovietvessels are not fishing in the waters of Community States. Agreement on conditions of reciprocal fishing between the Community and the Faroes for1978 could not be reached before the end of December, and such fishing wastherefore suspended from that date although negotiations continued.Section V.  Economic Monetary and Budgetary QuestionsEconomic and Monetary Co-operation45. In July the Council agreed on the guidelines, for the Community as awhole and for each individual member state, relating to the preparation of thenational Budgets for 1978. In September they agreed on a Community position for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington.46. In October the Council accepted an overall strategy proposed by theCommission to deal with the economic situation in the Community and decidedto examine at each of their meetings the implementation of this general strategyby the member states. The strategy included a minimum growth rate of 4 to 4^per cent in the Community&apos;s gross domestic product in real terms resulting from1 per cent additional growth in internal demand without increasing production costs; an improvement in the situation on the labour market by implementinga more dynamic policy in the area of employment and vocational training andthe development of labour mobility; and a reduction in the inflation rate in theCommunity to 8 per cent with a reduction in the spread of rates to a range of4 to 10 per cent.47. In November the Council adopted the annual report on the economicsituation in the Community, containing economic policy guidelines for 1978.They considered a Commission Communication on improving Co-ordinationof the national economic policies of the member states and asked the Co-ordinating Committee on Short Term Economic and Financial Policies, the monetary Committee, the Economic Policy Committee and the Committee ofthe Governors of the Central Banks to examine, each in its own field, on thebasis of the Commission Communication, how the economic and financialpolicies of the member states could be more closely co-ordinated. The Com-
-mittees were asked to submit their reports in time to enable the Finance Min-ministers to take a decision on the matter at one of their first meetings in 1978.48. The Council also agreed on a first Directive on the co-ordination oflaws to facilitate the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions.It requires member states to have a prior authorisation system for such in-institutions, which will have to meet certain qualitative criteria relating to ad-equacy of own funds and suitability of management. The requirements of the directive will be implemented by the legislation foreshadowed in the white paper The Licensing and Supervision of Deposit-Taking Institutions&apos; (Cmnd6584), which will be introduced as soon as Parlimentary time is available.49. The Council also agreed in principle to enlargement of the Community&apos;smedium-term credit facility, available to member states in balance of paymentsdifficulty. They also noted the conclusion of the Central Bank Governors thatsome increase in access to the short-term facility should be agreed, even though no change could be made to the total size of the facility.50. In November the Council received a Commission paper which pro-posed a 5-year action programme designed to make progress towards closereconomic and monetary union of the member states, envisaged greater con-vergence of their economic policies, the achievement of a single market andpromotion of structural and social change, but did not propose a specific date for monetary union. Following discussion at the European Council on 5-6December, the subject is now being examined by the relevant specialist Com-mittees of the Community, which will report back to the Council of Ministers.51. The Council also had a number of discussions on investment in theCommunity, and the subject was considered again at the European Council.The European Council agreed to the establishment, on an experimental basis,of a new Community loan of 1,000 MEUA to assist industrial investment. the requisite finance will be borrowed by the Commission and on-lent and managed by the European Investment Bank.Budgetary QuestionsFinancing the Budget52. On 19 December, the Council adopted a Regulation governing the calculation and paying over of VAT own resources. This Regulation wasnecessary in order to implement the Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax(adopted on 17 May 1977) which made it possible to complete the own resourcessystem through the introduction of VAT own resources. Revenue from VATown resources, at a rate not exceeding 1 per cent applied to a base established in a uniform manner in accordance with the Sixth Directive on VAT will,in place of the GNP-related financial contributions paid at present, finance the residual part of the Budget after the payment of all established agriculturallevies and customs duties (see also paragraph 58). The Council also adopted a Regulation laying down budgetary and financial provisions to govern the accouting, and the availability and use, of the Communities&apos; own resources from 1 January 1978.
Reform of the Budget Unit of Account53. The European Council agreed, on 6 December, that the EUA shouldbe used for the Community Budget with effect from 1 January 1978. The EUAis an accounting unit made up of a basket of specified amounts of each ofthe currencies of member states, the value of which is determined daily on thebasis of the exchange rates of each of the currencies in the exchange markets.The EUA replaces the unit of account previously used for the community budget which was based on gold and converted into national currencies onthe basis of parities declared, in terms of gold, to the International monetary fund.UK Contributions to the Community Budget54. The European Council reached agreement on how Article 131 of theTreaty of Accession which governs the contributions of the new member states to the Community Budget in 1978 and 1979 should be applied. TheCouncil agreed that in 1978 and 1979 each member state will contribute tothe Budget in accordance with the interpretation of Article 131 which is most advantageous to it; the resulting deficit on the Budget will be financed fromextra-budgetary payments by the member States again on the most favourablebasis of each of four alternative methods. These arrangements will leave afinal small financing gap; the means of financing this will be decided later.The 1978 Budget55. The full own resources system for financing the Community Budgetwill be applied by the six original member States from 1978; furthermore, theadoption on 17 May 1977 of the Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax made it possible to complete the own resources system through the introduction ofVAT own resources. The preliminary draft budget for 1978, presented by theCommission in June, took account of these two changes. In accordance witha proposal by the Commission that the unit of account used for the Com-munity Budget should be replaced by the EUA, the preliminary draft budgetwas denominated in EUA.56. The preliminary draft budget amounted to 11,850 MEUA (about 7,716 million) for payments, an increase of some 2,264 MEUA (about  1,474million) on the 1976 Budget. It was debated by both Houses of parliament on 18 July.57. The draft budget was approved by the Council of Ministers on 20 July.The Council reduced the provision in the preliminary draft budget by531 MEUA (about  346 million) to 11,319 MEUA. The draft budget, togetherwith revised estimates of the cost of the common agricultural policy whichwere incorporated in a letter of amendment and which revised the total to11,958 MEUA (about  7,787 million), was then sent to the European Assemblyfor their consideration. On 26 October the Assembly adopted amendmends and modifications to the draft budget totalling 618 MEUA (about  402 million).The Council considered these amendments and modifications on 22 November;following further discussions between the Council and the Assembly, the1978 Budget was adopted on 16 December with a total provision for payments of 12,384 MEUA (about  8,064 million).
58. VAT own resources could not, however, be introduced on 1 January1978 because the Sixth Directive had not been implemented by the requiredminimum of three member states, although the United Kingdom had done so;it will therefore be necessary to use GNP-related financial contributions forthe 1978 Budget. Since the Budget, as adopted, provided for the payment ofVAT own resources, it will have to be amended.Fiscal Questions59. On 19 December the Council adopted the Fifth Directive on tobaccotaxation which deals with the second stage of cigarette tax harmonisation.The Directive provides that the second stage shall run for two and a half years from 1 July 1978 to 21 December 1980. During this period, subject toa temporary derogation for the Irish Republic, the specific element in theduty on the most popular price class of cigarettes must amount to between  per cent and 55 per cent of the total taxation (including VAT). The Directiveprovides for the United Kingdom to have a derogation from the requirementsof the First Directive to permit the imposition of a supplementary duty forthe 2^-year period of the second stage on cigarettes with a tar yield of 20 mg.or above.60. The Commission sent to the Council on 8 August a communicationaimed at giving fresh impetus to a number of draft directives to harmonisethe scope and structure of the excise duties, as a step towards the eventualabolition of fiscal frontiers between member states. These proposals were originally submitted to the Council during 1972 and 1973, but little progress has since been made. The Commission has suggested that the Council lookagain at, first, the proposals for excises on alcohol (including beverage spiritsand fortified wines) and beer, and then the excise duties on mineral oils. Theproposals for a table wine excise duty and the draft &quot;framework&quot; directivewhich seeks to determine which classes of goods shall be subject to excise duties would be left on one side for the time being.61. Also on 19 December the Council adopted a Directive on mutual assistance between member states in the field of direct taxation. The Directiveauthorises taxation authorities of member states to exchange information forthe purpose of preventing evasion or avoidance of direct taxes on income and capital, subject to safeguards to protect the legitimate interests of taxpayers.62. Discussions are taking place on a proposal for a Council directiveestablishing an arbitration procedure in order to prevent the double taxation of profits when the prices paid in transactions between associated companies in different member states are adjusted for tax purposes to conform with theprice which would be paid in the case of transfers between independent enter-prises.63. On 21 December the Commission authorised the United kingdom under Article 108 of the e.c. Treaty to maintain restrictions on portfolio investment due to be liberalised on 1 January 1978 while continuing theirauthorisation, originally given in July 1975, in respect of direct investment and various personal capital movements. At the same time HM Treasuryannounced certain relaxations of exchange control in all three of these categories,to take effect from 1 January 1978.
Section VI.  Regional and Industrial AffairsEuropean Regional Development Fund64. The Commission has produced its second Annual Report on the opera-tion of the Fund. The United Kingdom has taken up in full its quota of  150-37million from the Fund for the three years 1975, 1976 and 1977. The EuropeanCouncil agreed in December on the size of the Fund for the next three years as follows: 1978: 580 MEUA &quot;)1979: 620 MEUA t Total 1,850 MEUA1980: 650 MEUA jThe Budget subsequently adopted for 1978 provides for commitments of581 MEUA. The United Kingdom quota share of the Fund is expected to beabout 27 per cent. Negotiations on the possibility of a non-quota section ofthe Fund, to be administered by the Commission, arc still continuing.Steel65. The Community steel market has continued to deteriorate and the Corn-mission have in hand the strengthening and extension of the measures theyhave taken to counter the effects of the world steel recession, including guidance on prices and deliveries within the Common Market and mandatory prices forcertain products. The Council on 19 and 20 December approved a mandate for the Commission to conclude bilateral agreements involving price disciplinewith the principal countries supplying steel to the Community in return forwhich assurances would be given on quantities. The Council also took note ofthe Commission^ proposed arrangements for a levy on Community imports.The Council gave its opinion on or agreed to draft Commission decisions on a variety of proposals designed to strengthen the Community steel market.Guidelines explaining the Commission^ approach to the problem of restructur-ing the Community steel industry have also been issued. The Government hasdrawn the attention of the Commission to the need for existing modernisation and closure plans to be taken into account during consideration of the restructur-ing of the Community steel industry.Company Law Harmonisation66. Progress was made on draft directives on company accounts, internalmergers, prospectuses, collective undertakings for transferable securities (unittrusts) and the admission of securities to official stock exchange quotation.Insurance67. Following a remit from the Council in February to speed up the ncgotia-tion of directives in the insurance field, discussion continued on co-insurance,the sale of non-life insurance on a services basis and life insurance on an establishment basis. The progress on these directives will be reviewed by theCouncil in March 1978.
Aircraft Construction Industry68. The Commission submitted to the Council of Ministers in October 1975 a preliminary report on, inter alia, the aircraft construction industry in response to a Council Resolution in March 1975 calling for consultation and concerta-tion between member states on industrial policy in this sector. A number of objectives for implementing the March 1975 Resolution were identified andembodied in a Council Statement in March 1977; in particular these called fora coherent strategy with regard to the manufacture of new, large civil aircraft;joint action by European manufacturers towards possible cooperation with american manufacturers; and joint basic research efforts. Member statesthrough both industry and Government are assisting the Commission in thepreparation of a further report on the opportunities for cooperation offered byprojects currently under examination and in joint research programmes.Shipbuilding69. Member States continued to cooperate closely and to pursue their common approach to the world shipbuilding crisis in the OECD. Although no formal international agreement has been reached to ensure the equitable distribution of new orders a measure of understanding was achieved betweenthe Community and Japanese Government regarding the measures whichmight be taken to alleviate the effects of the crisis. The Commission gave itsclearance to the United Kingdom Shipbuilding Intervention Fund and to asimilar Dutch scheme on 1 August 1977. Several other member states have sinceintroduced or announced new aid schemes all of which are designed to enableshipyards to quote competitive prices. The Commission put forward a new draft Directive on shipbuilding aids on 8 November which permits anti-crisisaids but provides for controls to ensure that they do not distort intra-Communitycompetition. They also sent a Communication to the Council on 9 Decemberemphasising the need to adapt to the low level of demand expected in the nextfew years and proposing a contraction by 45 per cent of the Community&apos;sshipbuilding industry; the Communication also suggests various measuresaimed at assisting the restructuring of the industry and alleviating the socialconsequence of contraction.European Investment Bank70.

Work has started on the steps which will be necessary to implement theCommunity Patent Convention when it comes into force. The creation of a community Trade Mark is being considered by a working group on Brussels.The Government has already announced its wish to see the Community TradeMark Office located in London.Removal of Barriers to Trade73. On 12 December 1977 the Council adopted a directive on the approximately-tion of the laws of Member States relating to the colouring matters which maybe added to medicinal products.Section VII.  Environment and TransportEnvironment74. Discussion has continued on a number of proposals arising from thesecond e.c. Environment Programme. At the Council of Ministers&apos; meeting on12 December, agreement was reached on directives on waste from the titaniumdioxide industry and on toxic and dangerous wastes. A proposed directive onthe conservation of birds, which was debated in the House of Commons on17 November, should soon be ready for adoption.Civil Aviation75. The Transport Working Group has begun discussions on closer liaison between the Commission and ECAC (European Civil Aviation Conference)and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation).Transport76. The Council of Ministers on 27 October agreed to amendments to the eec Social Regulation including in particular a &quot;safeguard clause&quot; which willenable the UK to implement the more restrictive controls on drivers&apos; hours inrespect of domestic road passenger and goods traffic by phases over three years from 1 January 1978. The Commission has since issued a Decision on theprogramme for this.
77. The Council also approved a related regulation to bring into force theEuropean Agreement on the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in Inter-national Road Transport (AETR); adopted a Directive on mutual recognitionof formal qualifications in the road transport industry; adopted an amendment to the 1972 regulation on common rules for bus and coach services between member states; adopted a regulation for fixing rates for an experimental period for the international carriage of goods by road between member statesso that member states can continue with compulsory tariffs or use reference(or indicative) tariffs as they see fit; and adopted a regulation designed to makeit easier to compare the financial results of e.c. railway undertakings. TheCouncil also adopted a resolution categorically condemning all forms of airpiracy and terrorism.78. At the December meeting the Council agreed to broaden the Commis-sion&apos;s mandate for negotiations with third countries about common rules for international occasional services by bus and coach; to increase by 20 per cent the Community quota for the international carriage of goods by road; and to add some minor items to the categories of international road transport whichare free of quota and permit control. The Council also adopted an improvedprocedure for consultation on transport infrastructure projects of Communityinterest and took note of the Commission^ Work Programme for the period up to the end of 1980.79. As a possible prelude to infraction proceedings against the UK for non-compliance with the Tachograph Regulation the Commission formally invited the UK to give its observations, which were submitted. Meanwhile the approvalof tachograph calibration centres throughout the UK has gone ahead. Driversof vehicles with tachographs calibrated and sealed by an approved centre maychoose to use tachograph charts instead of log books.Section VOL Social AffairsUnemployment80. As reaffirmed at the December meeting of the European Council, thelevel of unemployment continues to be a major cause for concern in the Com-munity. At the request of the June European Council, Social Affairs Ministersmet on 28 October to discuss a Commission communication on the problemsof youth employment. They asked the Commission to submit proposals for anew category of aid under the Social Fund which would be likely to promoteemployment especially for young workers and which would not fall into theexisting categories of aid for vocational training or occupational mobility. TheCommission^ communication was also considered by representatives of govern-ments and of employers&apos; organisations and trade unions on 24 November atthe Standing Committee on Employment.Social Fund81. At their meeting in October the Council also settled the outstanding issues on the review of the European Social Fund which remained following the agreement in principle reached at their meeting on 28 June. The new agree-ment provides for a greater concentration of the Fund&apos;s resources in backward
regions and regions suffering from industrial decline. Five of the regions in themost severe economic difficulty will benefit from a higher rate of assistance 55 per cent instead of 50 per cent. Northern Ireland is one of these regions.The administrative procedures for the operation of the Fund were streamlinedand provision is made for advances to be paid to successful applicants: 30 percent of the agreed allocation at the start of the operation and 30 per cent at the half-way stage.82. Agreement was reached in December on a scheme of assistance for thetraining of women over 25. (Women under 25 can benefit from the existingArticle 4 scheme for young people).83. In 1977 the UK submitted applications for assistance from the Fundtotalling  155 million. Allocations totalling  85 million have been approved.Social Security84. In October the Council also approved amendments to the Regulationson the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community to bring the procedure for dealing withinvalidity benefit claims where Belgian, Dutch, Irish or UK legislation is involved,into line with that operating in other member states. A claim to a proportionateamount of British invalidity benefit can now be considered when a person who has spent part of his insured life in the United Kingdom falls sick in amember state where the rate of invalidity benefit is directly related to a person&apos;sinsurance record (Denmark, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg).The Poverty Programme85. The Council has approved the extension of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty, agreed by them in 1975 to run for 2 years, to be extendedbeyond December 1977.Illegal Immigration and Illegal Employment86. Following various discussions and after the Assembly had produced its opinion, the Commission withdrew for further consideration its draft directiveon illegal immigration and illegal employment.Meeting of Community Health Ministers87. On 13 December 1977 Health Ministers of the Community met for thefirst time to discuss general problems of current interest. A useful exchange of views took place on the economic aspects of the provision of health care, and information was given on the measures being taken in member states to limitincreases in costs. Ministers also discussed policies for health education andthere was agreement on the need to give a high priority to measures aimed atreducing tobacco consumption. The Commission were invited to convene ameeting of experts from member states to exchange information on vaccinationpolicy. The Commission were also asked to call a similar meeting to examinethe ways in which medical advice could more readily be made available to theCommission by member states and to consider topics for discussion at a second meeting of Ministers.
Section DC. Education88. Progress was made on the implementation of the 4-year cooperativeaction programme designed to complement member states&apos; initiatives and policies in the field of the transition from school to work. The Commissionannounced in November the first phase of a programme of about 20 pilotprojects, including two in the United Kingdom. These projects will start inSeptember 1978 and run for three years. The first of a series of workshops for those taking part in them was held in Harrogate in November. A scheme of grants to enable specialists in vocational education and guidance to make studyvisits to other Community countries in 1978-79 has also been announced.89. The Commission also held Conferences on how to increase mobilitywithin the Community for students and teachers in secondary education; on thedevelopment of a common policy for the admission of students to higher education; on the training of administrative staff in higher education in-institutions; and on the creation of links between non-university institutions of higher education.90. 15 individuals and 22 institutions in the United Kingdom were among those awarded grants for study visits by teaching and administrative staff in higher education and for the encouragement of joint courses of study; thosegrants are for the academic year 1977-78, which is the second year of operationof these schemes.Section X. Research91. The management arrangements and the choice of the site for the JointEuropean Torus (JET) project under the Community thermonuclear fusionprogramme continued to dominate Council discussions in the research field.Controlled fusion power shows the greatest potential among long term sources of energy currently under investigation, though its development is likely to be both long and costly. The Community programme is concentrated on magneticconfinement and heating of high temperature plasma and JET will be thelargest experiment so far attempted in this field in Europe. Member countries were anxious that the organisational structure and site should be chosen both to reflect the Community character of the project and to give it the best chanceof success. At the Council in mid-October, Foreign Ministers agreed the organisational structure of the project and at a Research Council later thesame month, as a result of progress made in earlier discussions, it was decidedthat the project should be sited at Culham in Oxfordshire. The Governmentwarmly welcomed the siting of this important Community project in theUnited Kingdom. Following the choice of site, progress has been made in discussion on the detailed management arrangements for the project.92. The multi-annual research programme of the Joint Research Centre(JRC) for the period 1977-80 was agreed and adopted in July, together witha resolution which provides for a revised structure of management committees to advise on the JRC and other Community research programmes.93. The Council has also adopted the first of a new type of Communityprogramme based upon the exchange of information about Member States&apos;research. The programme relates to the treatment of sewage sludge.
94. In July the Commission forwarded to the Council its proposals for thefurther development of a common policy for the Community in the field of science and technology.Section XI. Energy95. On 25 October, the Council adopted three recommendations on therational use of energy, and reached agreement on Community support measures for technological projects in the hydrocarbons sector, on Community arrange-ments for reducing energy consumption in the event of oil supply difficulties,and on Community surveillance of coal imports from non-e.c. countries.96. On 13 December, the Council considered a Commission Report on community energy policy objectives for 1985, and agreed the objectives of reducing the Community&apos;s dependence on external sources of energy and oil,and reducing the rate of growth of energy consumption. The Council also agreed a directive on the performance, regulation, and inspection of heatgenerators and the insulation of the heating distribution systems in new buildings,and commissioned further work on specialised installations. Ministers werefavourably disposed towards a draft regulation for supporting energy-savingdemonstration projects which they hoped would soon be ready for decision.The Council also discussed proposals for financing of cyclical coal stocks andfor assisting the construction of coal-burning power stations, both of whichwill be discussed at a subsequent Council. The refining situation in the Com-munity was also discussed and it was agreed that work on this would continue.Proposals to support demonstration projects on alternative energy sources,and to support hydrocarbon exploration, were remitted for further study.97. On 20 December 1977, the Council approved the arrangementsnegotiated between the Commission and the Canadian Government to updatethe safeguards provision of the 1959 Canada/Euratom Nuclear CooperationAgreement.Section XII.  Institutional MattersTindcnians&apos; Report98. A report on the developments on Mr. Tindemans&apos; Report on european union in the course of 1977 was presented by Foreign Ministers to the EuropeanCouncil on 5/6 December 1977, which also took note of a progress report onthe same subject by the Commission.Direct Elections99. The legislation necessary for direct elections to the European assembly to be held in this country was introduced in Parliament in November, and is currently going through its Committee Stage. The House of Commons votedon 13 December in favour of retaining the simple majority electoral system forAssembly elections in Great Britain.The European Court of Auditors100. Ratification by all member states of the Treaty of 22 July 1975 settingup a new European Court of Auditors was complete at the end of May 1977,
and on 18 October the Council approved the list of nine members of the Courtnominated in accordance with the Treaty. The Council adopted a Regulationgoverning the members&apos; condition of service on the same occasion. The AuditCourt has now been established in Luxembourg.Right of Establishment101. Proposals concerning architects, midwives, dental and veterinarysurgeons are still under consideration.European Foundation102. The European Council on 5-6 December discussed a report on theestablishment of a European Foundation, to promote human contacts withinthe Community. Further study is to be given to this proposal during 1978.Legal Co-operation103. The United Kingdom has, like the other member states, submittedobservations on the Draft Convention for the Accession of the new member states to the e.c. Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judg-ments. The United Kingdom observations are mainly directed at the provisionsof the Convention which restrict the right of litigants to choose a court byagreement, provisions which have been criticised in the 45th Report of theHouse of Lords Select Committee on European Legislation as tending to beharmful in commercial transactions. Discussions on the Governmental observa-tions will take place early in 1978.European Court of Justice104. In the period under review United Kingdom courts have referred threecases to the Court for preliminary ruling, and the Government has submittedobservations on five other cases which have come before the Court for pre-liminary ruling.Section XIII.   Parliament and the European Communities105. The Government has undertaken to examine ways of strengtheningParliament^ control over European Community legislation, and is consideringin this context how the present scrutiny and debate arrangements in the Houseof Commons might be improved. Ways of increasing the flow of information about the Community to Parliament and the public will also be considered aspart of the process of improving scrutiny procedures. The Lord President ofthe Council confirmed the Governments commitment to such improvements in the debate in the House of Commons on 28 November 1977.106. Parliament was in session for 10 weeks during the period from 1 july to 31 December 1977. During that time, the House of Commons ScrutinyCommittee examined and reported on 355 Community documents, of which 56were recommended for debate. The House of Lords Scrutiny Committeeexamined and reported on 329 documents of which seven were recommended for debate. Debates on 42 documents were held in the House of Commons andon 10 in the House of Lords during this period.
