document is the property of her britannic majestvs government cp(78) 2323 February 1978cabinetBASIS FOR PREPARING THE 1978 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. We need to launch the 1978 public expenditure survey by instructingofficials how to draw up the survey report to Ministers.    The draft instructionsannexed follow the pattern of previous years.    Their purpose is simply to commission the factual material required as background to the decisions on public expenditure which we shall take later in the year.2. The survey report needs to provide a benchmark, or baseline,against which to measure possible changes in expenditure, and an analysis of possible changes which will give us a. wide enough room for choice. the choice of baseline is more straightforward this year than last, since cmnd 7049 already provides a considered though provisional, path for expenditure over the first four years of the new survey period.    The draft instructions provide that the baseline should be the figures in Cmnd 7049revalued to 1978 survey prices, subject to any agreed changes we make inthe period up to mid-May (including any changes we announce in the Budget).3. As last year, the draft provides that the baseline figures for the finalyear of the survey (1982-83, which is covered for the first time in thissurvey), should repeat those for the preceding year (1981-82).    This leavesus free to decide where any increases in rhat year should be allocated; our decisions about that year will in any event be highly provisional.4. Again as last year, the draft instructions provide that the report should set out proposals for additional expenditure, and that savings whichcould be made to offset these additions should be identified.    The instructionsalso provide that the report should show realistic options for reductions(though on a smaller scale than last year):  even when no reduction in ouroverall plans is needed, these enable Ministers to examine choices and priorities within public expenditure as a whole.5. I ask my colleagues to agree that the Public Expenditure survey committee should prepare the 1978 report on the basis set out in the annex to this note.J treasury Chambers23 February 1978COP I NO80
ANNEXBASIS FOR PREPARATION OF 1978 SURVEY REPORTIntroduction1. The purpose of the 1978 survey is to enable Ministers todecide the level of public expenditure programmes as a basis for control  in 1979-80;   and to review the programmes for later years,and extend them into 1982-831   for provisional planning purposes.The survey report prepared by officials is intended to provide thematerial on which such decisions can be taken.     The analysis ofadditional proposals and options for reductions does not imply that Ministers will necessarily adopt  any or all of them,  but isintended to enable them to discuss a wider range of choices and priorities within public  expenditure as a whole.The starting point2. The 1978  survey takes as its starting point the levels ofexpenditure programmes published in &quot;The Government&apos;s ExpenditurePlans:  1978-79 to 1981-82&quot;  (Cmnd 70^9).3. For the years 1978-79,   1979-80,   I98O-81  and I98I-82, thefigures to be included in the survey baseline tables are thosepublished in Cmnd 70^9,   adjusted for:i. revaluation to 1978  survey prices;ii. any changes approved by Ministers up to 19 May 1978, andany offsetting savings agreed in connection with such changes;iii. any reductions in the volume of expenditure agreedduring the examination of 1978-79 Estimates;iv. for 1979-80 and subsequent years,   &quot;good housekeeping&quot;savings agreed with the CSD;v. any approved classification changes.1(confidential)1
k.       For 1982-83,   the baseline figures should be equal  to those for I98I-82,   except where  it  is agreed between the Treasury andthe department  concerned that  some lesser figure is appropriate.Any requirements going beyond the I98I-82 level  should be identified for Cabinet decision.The survey report5*       The  survey report  should provide the  following information.a. The Cmnd 70^9 figures, alter revaluation and classifica&quot;*tion changes;b. agreed changes since Cmnd 70^9;c. the resulting baseline figures for the new survey;d. proposed additions and reduced requirements (seeparagraph 7 below);e. options for reductions (see paragraph 8 below).The items  at  d.   and e.   apply only to 1979-80 and the threesubsequent years.     Proposals for additional  expenditure in 1978-7should not normally be made in the  context of the survey; anysuch proposals will be dealt with as they arise through the yeai&quot;as part of the operational  control of the contingency reserve.6. The  chapter on each programme  should set out the maincomponents of the baseline figures  and describe the implications of keeping expenditure on the  services  concerned within thesefigures.     Each of the items under 5d.   and e.   should also bebriefly described and tabulated.     The description should include an indication    of the  spending authority concerned (xe centralgovernment  department,   local  authority.       or public corporationAny consequences for civil  service or local  authority manpowershould be stated.the. In the case of items under 5d,   the report  should describe/ o fro&quot;1nature of the proposed changes  (eg noting whether they arisechanged economic  or demographic  assumptions or for other reasoIt  should also indicate whether the level  of the expenditureconcerned is governed by existing legislation or regulations or(confide ntjaP)
is within the Government1s administrative control.     Any savingsthat  could be made to offset proposed additions to expenditure should be identified.0.       As regards the options under 5e,   the report  should illustrate the most  feasible reductions in programmes in 1979-80 and later years,   amounting to at least 2-J- per cent  each year. Theseoptions may include the offsetting savings mentioned inparagraph 7 provided that  the latter savings could be made ontheir own,   without the accompanying increases in expenditure.Programme  texts should indicate whether main or subordinate legislation would be required and whether legislation in whichthe change could be included is already planned.     The responsibledepartment  and  spending authority should be  stated,   and the specific  areas where the reductions would fall  should be identified.     As noted above,   the inclusion of options in thereport  in no way implies  that Ministers will  adopt  them,   but itenables them to examine choices and priorities within the overalltotal.9. The nationalised industries will be the  subject of aseparate interdepartmental  report to Ministers on the investment programmes  and financing for each industry,   including appropriateoptions in respect of individual  industries.     The financing figuresfor the nationalised industries as a whole will be  summarised inthe survey report.     If &quot;the proposals  for total net borrowing arehigher than the figures in Cmnd 70^9,   the reasons for this willbe summarised and options for    offsetting reductions will   be setout.     Any changes  in the net government  lending figures whichresult  from changes  in the assumptions on the pattern of netforeign currency borrowing will be explained.10. In preparation for any changes which may result  from thelegislation on devolution to Scotland and Wales,   it  is hoped toinclude  a  special  analysis of expenditure which,   under the proposallegislation,  would be devolved to the Scottish and WelshAssemblies and its financing,   together with the correspondingexpenditure in England.(confidential)
