UMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)21 COPY NO gl)21 February 1978CABINETCAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE DEPENDENT OVERSFASTERRITORIESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. Capital punishment has been abclished in all Dependent overseas territories (DOT) except Belize, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, theCayman Islands, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos and Hong Kong whoselegislatures have resolved not to consider legislation to this effect.    In these territories, as in all the Colonial dependencies for more than 100 years, tnePrerogative of Mercy is delegated to the Governor and regularly exercised by him, but The Queen still retains her residual Prerogative Power.    in allthese territories, the constitutional instruments by which the Prerogativewas delegated contain a formal requirement for the Governor to holdconsultations either with his Ministers or with a special committee beforebe takes his decision.    If the Governor does not exercise the Prerogative,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary does not advise The Queen to intervene, unless there has been an evident miscarriage of justice. Thispolicy, which is based on the theory that the Governor and his advisers arein a better position to judge than the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary would be, was first enunciated by the then Colonial Secretary,Mr Arthur Creech-Jones, in a Parliamentary reply on 11 August 1947(Hansard Volume 441, Cole. 232-3).    Under this policy there have beennumerous instances where the capital sentence has been commuted withoutany prompting from the Secretary of State and some instances wherecommutation has been effected locally in the light of consultations betweenthe Governor and the Secretary of State.2- Since the abolition of capital punishment for murder in theUnited Kingdom in 1965, the death sentence has been carried out on fouroccasions in the DOT: 1966 (Hong Kong), 1972 (British Virgin Islands),x974 (Belize) and 1977 (Bermuda).    In the early part of 19 77, when the8entences passed on the two men convicted in Bermuda were underconsideration, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary raised with hiscolleagues the question of the continued appropriateness of the 1941c*eech-Jones doctrine to the situation of today.    He proposed that consideration should be given to finding means either of abolishing the death
penalty in those DOT where it is still retained or of revising the existingconstitutional procedures so as to ensure that, in all cases where a death sentence had been imposed, there was an opportunity for the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary to recommend a reprieve.3. This proposal was considered last October by a Ministerial Groupunder my chairmanship, which agreed on the desirability of changing thePresent policy which was formulated in circumstances at home and abroadvery different from today1 s.    We recognised that there would be likely to beresistance in the DOT concerned to any suggestion that they should themselves legislate to abolish the death penalty and concluded therefore that any change would have to be made by action in the United kingdom parliament.    We did not however reach a conclusion on whether such action should take the lorm of legislation or abrogation of the Creech-Jones doctrine,We were in any case doubtful about the wisdom of introducing a generalchange in the constitutional arrangements against the background of thecurrent case in Bermuda (which, because it involved the murder of a governor, was a particularly difficult one).    My colleagues will be awareQf the exchanges which took place in the House of Commons following theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement on 5 December aboutthe executions in Bermuda (Hansard Volume 940, Cols. 1014-1024), these and the public disturbances in Bermuda showed clearly that the Creech-Jonesdoctrine was no longer seen as adequate justification for the Governmentto dissociate itself in such cases.    In view of the considerable Parliamentaryinterest I agreed on 8 December that the House should have the opportunityQ* considering the general issue (Hansard Volume 94C, Col. 1662).4* The Group met again earlier this month to consider further how wccould best give effect to our acceptance of the need to change the presentsituation.    We looked first at the possibility of abolishing the death penalty1Ji the DOT by legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament.    We recognisedthat this could give rise to difficulties owing to the special situation in certainterritories.    It would in any case not be possible to find Parliamentary timeln this Session and we all felt that early action was needed.    The alternative^ould be to proceed by way of a Resolution in the House of Commonsabrogating the Creech-Jones doctrine.    If this were adopted, it would haveto be clear that the Prerogative was being exercised, not on the basis of aPredetermined policy of recommendation of reprieve, which would be^constitutional, but on a case by case basis having regard to the specialClr cum stances relating to each case and all other relevant considerations ofa Public and private nature.^&apos; The effect of adopting this procedure would be to introduce a two tier8vstem whereby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would only beSquired to advise The Queen on the use of the Prerogative in cases wherethe Governor had not granted a repiieve.    We recognised the burden whichthis would impose on the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, who in caseswhere he recommended the grant of a reprieve would be publicly revealed as
having gone against the advice of the Governor.    His intervention in suchcases might cause serious local resentment in the DOT concerned.Nevertheless, we concluded that, in all the circumstances, this was thebest way to proceed.6. I attach the text of the proposed Resolution as agreed by the ministerial Group.    Although the Creech-Jones doctrine was announced in answer to a Question we considered it advisable, in view of the length oftime since it was established, to allow a proposal for changing it to be debated and voted on.    vVe also agreed that this was a case where a free vote should be allowed and that therefore a Private member s resolution was more suitable than a Government Motion.    Such a Resolution could beput forward by one of our Members who is successful at the next private members&apos; Ballot, but this could involve considerable delay.    As analternative, therefore, 1 would propose to discuss with the Chief Whip thepossibility of arranging for an Early Day Motion in Government time. TheHouse of Lords will probably also wish to have an opportunity to discuss this question, but the operative Resolution would be taken in the House ofCommons.* - i invite my colleagues to agree:a. on the desirability of changing the present policy basedon the Creech-Jones doctrine; and b. that this should be done by means of a Resolution inthe House of Commons as proposed in paragraph 6.M Fprivy Council Office2* February 19783
ANNEXTHAT THIS HOUSEcalls upon the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonv;eaIth Affairs in future to review any sentence*f death passed and upheld in a dependent overseasterritory and, in considering v/hat advice to tenderto Her Majesty concerning the exercise of the royal prerogative of Mercy, to take account of all the relevant circumstances including any advice tenderedby the Governor of the territory concerned.
