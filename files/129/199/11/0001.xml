defence POLICY101. United Kingdom defence policy is based on the North atlantic alliance, which has worked well for more than a quarter of a century.   The key principle of the North Atlantic Treaty, that anattack on one member is an attack on all, has provided far greatersecurity than any member could have achieved alone.   The UnitedKingdom shares the benefits and the obligations of membership. TheGovernment&apos; s policy continues to be to concentrate our defence effort on the Alliance in the ways that can best contribute tothe strength of the Alliance and thus to our own security.102. Defence policy needs to be seen in the wider context of our international security aims, in the service of which defence is apartner with other aspects of policy.    These include action toremove or alleviate the causes of international tension, and the continuing search to widen and strengthen multilateral armscontrol and disarmament wherever possible.   The various aspects ofdetente and deterrence complement one another in reinforcingsecurity.   The Government is active in each of them, in closeaccord with our North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Allies.DETENTE AND DISARMAMENT103. During the last twelve months there have been some encouragingadvances in arms control prospects, notably in negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban and, as a result of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, on strategic armslimitation.1
Comprehensive Test Ban104. Since July 1977 the United Kingdom has been negotiating with the United States and the Soviet Union towards a ComprehensiveTest Ban Treaty.   Our objective is a multilateral treaty banningall nuclear explosions, with effective verification and the adherence of as many states as possible, nuclear and non-nuclear.The negotiations have made good progress.   We are now working tonarrow the differences on the outstanding issues.   We believeagreement can be achieved.Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT)105. The interim agreement between the United States and theSoviet Union on the limitation of strategic nuclear arms expiredon 3 October 1977* but both governments have said they will continueto act as though it were in force.   Negotiations continue betweenthem towards a new agreement and the United Kingdom Governmentattaches great importance to a successful outcome.Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR)106. Despite constant efforts by the West, progress in the Viennanegotiations on the mutual and balanced reduction of forces in central Europe is disappointing.   The agreed aim of providinggreater stability at a lower level of forces without impairingthe security of either side seems still a long way off.107*   Western proposals remain firmly based on the principle that force reductions should achieve approximate parity between the2
forces of the two sides in the area by establishing a commoncollective ceiling on Eastern and Western manpower.    The Allianceproposes specific reductions on each side in forms designed tocontribute as much as possible to stability in the area.   The Westestimates that in ground forces Eastern manpower exceeds Westernmanpower by more than 150*000* although the East claims thatapproximate parity already exists.   To identify the reasons forthis discrepancy the West has been pressing for a discussion of figures, and in July 1977 put forward proposals for a detailedexchange of data.   Certain problems have still to be resolved,but it is hoped that an exchange can take place soon.108. The MBFR negotiations are of great importance, and theGovernment will continue with its Allies to strive for an outcomethat will genuinely enhance stability in Europe.   The Governmenthas no intention however, in advance of an agreement, of reducingthe forces we maintain on the mainland of Europe in fulfilment of our Brussels Treaty obligations.Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)109. The CSCE follow-up meeting opened in Belgrade in October 1977*following a preparatory meeting in the summer.   The conference is 
considering the provisions of the 1975 Final Act.   The ones of direct military relevance are the confidence-building measures,designed to reduce the risks of military miscalculation ormisunderstanding.110.    Since the signing of the Final Act, NATO countries, andfor the most part the neutral and non-aligned countries also,have implemented these measures in a liberal and forthcoming way-They have notified not only all major manoeuvres involving over25,000 troops but a large number of smaller-scale manoeuvres(whose notification is discretionary).   They have invited observerfrom CSCE participating states, including the Warsaw Pact countrieS&apos;to many of their manoeuvres.   Until just before the Belgrademeeting, the Warsaw Pact countries took a more restrictive line;for example, they refused all invitations to manoeuvres in NATOcountries.    More recently, however, they have begun to accept sueinvitations, and in January the United Kingdom was, for the first time, invited to send observers to a Soviet exercise.    In BelgradeBritish and other NATO representatives have drawn attention tothe discrepancies in the implementation of this aspect of theFinal Act.   They have sought to develop confidence-buildingmeasures further, in particular by strengthening the commitment to notify smaller manoeuvres and movements, and by improving tneconditions under which invited observers can operate.
 eJnited Nations Special Session on Disarmament^   The Government looks forward to the United Nations Specialssion on Disarmament to be held in May and June, and hopes itimprove the prospects for further measures.   The Unitedkingdom has taken an active part in the preparatory work, and is^utting forward some new proposals for action.OthGn a-^L^rms Control and Disarmament Measures*   The United Kingdom continues to attach great value to the^ Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, anci has^tinued its efforts to persuade further states to accede to it,and touo promote other arrangements to reduce the risk of the spreadnuclear weapons.   The Government is playing an increasinglyc-tive part in efforts to achieve progress on arms control in thenited Nations, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD)ande^sewhere.    Many of these negotiations are entering important new Phases.The British draft convention on banning the development,tion and stockpiling of chemical weapons and destroying them,u in the CCD in 1976, has been further debated. FasterSs may be possible when current consultations between thestates and the Soviet Union are completed.   Last May theUnited tt *kingdom signed the Convention on the prohibition of militaryv other hostile use of environmental modification techniques,V;llich nhad been negotiated by the CCD and endorsed by the UN General&quot;977 also saw the first Review Conference of the Treaty banningtlle Pla -Clnc of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction011 theseabed.   The United Kingdom welcomed the Conference^-^mation of the parties1 support for the Treaty.
115. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed in October 1977a treaty on the Prevention of Accidental Nuclear War.   Each partyundertakes to maintain and where necessary improve its safeguards against the unauthorised or accidental use of nuclear weapons,and to notify each other immediately of any incident.   The Treatycame into force on 10 October 19771 and is similar in purpose to existagreements between the United States snd the Soviet Union, andFrance and the Soviet Union.116. The United Kingdom has also, with a public explanation ofits position on them, signed two Protocols to the 194-9 GenevaConventions.   These Protocols extend and bring up to date theprovisions of the Geneva Conventions and the 1907 Hague Rules of warfare.   They significantly improve the protection given to the victims of war.DETERRENCE AND DEFENCE117. The realities of today&apos;s world mean that, however high ourhopes and desires, we cannot responsibly assume that our effortsfor detente and disarmament will be enough on their own to ensureadequate security.   A major defence effort is also needed, and is indeed a precondition of successful political action.   We must therefore continue to make a proper contribution to not&apos;s strategyof deterrence.118. For effective deterrence the Alliance needs to convince anyaggressor that the use of force, or the threat of its use for political ends, carries risks far outweighing any likely advantage*not*s deterrent strategy is based on forward defence and thecapability of flexible response.   Forward defence means that NATO6
is committed to defend the full territorial integrity of its members and to halt any attack at the earliest possible point.Flexible response means that NATO must have a range of militaryoptions wide enough to ensure that whatever form aggression tookNATO would have the ability to meet it effectively without having to face an intolerable choice between conceding defeat and usingdangerously excessive force from the start.   For this purpose NATOdeploys three main levels of forces - conventional, theatre nuclear*hd strategic nuclear.   The three levels are inter-dependent, and successful deterrence requires a balanced combination of them.119.     The Alliance must have a strategic nuclear capability^oadly equivalent to that of the Soviet Union.   Theatre nuclearPapons are needed to deter the use of similar weapons by the SovietU&quot;ion and, through their links with the conventional defence on theQae hand and the strategic forces on the other, to complete thePehge of deterrence by showing NATO&apos;s resolve to respond at whateverXe*el might be necessary.   The use of nuclear weapons would be a0atter for the closest political control, but the knowledge thattQey will be used if necessary to stop aggression is an essentialdement in deterrence.   Finally, without a strong conventionallability the Alliance would be bound to rely heavily on nuclear^Pons, so reverting to the &quot;tripwire&quot; strategy abandoned in the1960s.   such reliance would lower the &quot;nuclear threshold&quot;, andPiously weaken the overall credibility of deterrence.7
WARSAW PACT CAPABILITY1.20.   The forces which NATO needs to implement this deterrent strategymust depend in large measure upon the scale and character of the potential military threat posed by the forces of the Soviet Union 0ndits Warsaw Pact allies.   The capability of these forces is formidableand growing.121.   The assessment of military balance is complex and many-sided,and cannot be reduced to a single neat ratio.   On any view, however *Soviet forces have in many areas been strengthened in size and qu0^ ^on a scale which goes well beyond the needs of any purely defensiveposture.   Figures    1-4   illustrate the substantial growth of soviet forces since 1968 and the current balance of NA^O(excluding French forces) and Warsaw Pact forces in the easternAtlantic and central Europe, two areas crucial to NATO and to theUnited Kingdom.     The comparisons in Figures 3 &amp; 4- canillustrate only a broad trend.   They do not reflect two particul01,factors of concern to NATO, the state of readiness of Warsaw P0ctforces in Europe, which has always exceeded that of NATO forceshas recently been improved, and the continued introduction of enew equipment.   Nor do they take into account geography, deploylogistic support, strategy and tactics, training and morale.i * WeEurope recent developments in Africa, for example,shown that the Soviet Union is ready and able to deploy milit0r^resources rapidly in support of its political interests in the ^World; this demonstration of conventional capability is a furwhich must be taken into account..   d ne*-122* In the last five years Soviet naval forces have receiveclasses of submarines, surface ships and aircraft.

Soviet ground forces have been strengthened by large numbersWt self-propelled artillery, new tanks, infantry combat vehicles,-slicopters (some of them very heavily armed) and missiles of2*advanced design.124. Major re-equipment programmes have markedly increased the?3nge and weapon-load of Soviet aircraft.    Modern swing-wingaircraft such as Fencer and Flogger have entered service, and:8ckfire has joined the Long-Range Air Force.   New armaments and-fitter avionics for reconnaissance, target acquisition and weaponsitting have been introduced.c5.    The East German, Polish and Czech armies are being strengthened^ more and better equipment, mainly of Soviet origin, such as3lr*defence missiles, armoured personnel carriers, artillery andobstacle -crossing equipment.    In addition, East Germany has receivedv0dern assault helicopters and air-defence aircraft.   Poland and^Bulgaria have new swing-wing tactical aircraft, and Hungary more*^ern air-defence aircraft.We do not know the exact amount of Soviet military expenditure.^e Soviet Union does not reveal figures which could be accepted asparable with Western defence budget information, and has not been wiH^0 take part in the UN Secretary-general s proposals for a pilot&quot;^y on standardised reporting of military expenditure. Careful&apos;**tern assessments suggest however that, on the definitions&apos;a$totnary in NATO of what constitutes military expenditure, the9
scale of Soviet military effort could not be sustained without a continuing resource allocation of the order of 11-13% of Sovietgross national product.    It is clear that a very large proportionof the total goes on new weapons systems including an immensehigh-technology research and development programme over the entirerange of military equipment.   The Soviet Union also has very largeresources of trained military manpower, based on universalconscription with a minimum period of two years1 full-time service.12.7.     Much of the Soviet equipment now reaching the front line in such large numbers no doubt derives from decisions taken several years ago.   There is however no sign that more recent developments in the field of detente are leading the Soviet Government toslacken the pace of its military effort.NATO DEFENCE EFFORT128.     There h8s been a clear and collective recognition by NATOmember Governments, at the highest level, of the need for an appropriate NATO response to the continuing growth of the military capability of the Warsaw Pact.   The Alliance&apos;s commitment to the deterrent -strategy of forward defence and flexible response, basedon the triad of force elements, has been strongly re-affirmed,notably by President Carter.129*     The past year has been an extremely busy and productive one for NATO*s defence planning work.   The Ministerial meeting of theDefence Planning Committee (DPC) in December 1976 accepted that further measures would be needed to reverse the unfavourable trends
in the military balance.   All member countries have accordinglyreviewed their defence contributions for specific force improve-ments and commitments to strengthen NATO&apos;s conventional defence,particularly in the fields of anti-armour and anti-submarine warfare and sir defence.    Improvements are in hand in all threefields, and national plans will bring further improvements.150.    In May 1977 NATO Defence Ministers took three importantsteps.   First, they agreed to the terms of the 1977 EPC MinisterialGuidance for 1979 to 1984, the key document for national and NATOplanning.   Member nations were asked to aim at an annual increasein real terms of defence expenditure in the region of 3% from 1979,although it wss recognised that for some countries economic circumstances would affect what could be achieved while present levels of force contribution might sometimes suggest bigger increases.^31.    Secondly, as agreed at the North Atlantic Council meeting ofEeads of State and Government in London in May, the Alliance will^dertake a long-term defence programme to make NATO forces betteraMe to meet the needs of the 1980s.   Studies are being carried0ut in ten priority areas: readiness; reinforcements; mobilisation^reserves; maritime strategy; air defence; communications;Command and control; electronic warfare; rationalisation (including^ter-operability and standardisation); consumer logistics (includingV8r reserve stocks) ;and the modernisation of theatre nuclear forces.* Consolidated report is to be considered by the NATO Summit meetingthe spring of 1978.
132.     Finally, to complement this effort, NATO Defence ministers have agreed on an immediate programme of short-term measures, tobe implemented by the end of 1978, in anti-armour defence, warreserve munitions and readiness and reinforcement.   At their meeting in December 1977 they endorsed significant improvements tobe made in all three areas.   The Alliance will for example increase its holdings of anti-armour missiles by about one third by the endof 1978, and similar improvements in stocks of other criticalmunitions are planned.   The United Kingdom is making improvements in each of the areas.   A second Royal Marine Commando group willbe trained for mountain and Arctic warfare by April 1978, a yearearlier than previously planned, and 41 Commando, Royal Marines hasbeen retained and assigned to NATO.    It has recently been decidedto restore HMS Bulwark to full operational status.   A number of reserve helicopters have been earmarked to NATO for anti-submsrinewarfare and certain Naval communications and training aircraft havebeen earmarked for general maritime support and utility duties.The Army is increasing the number of Milan anti-tank missiles beingdeployed to front-line units in 1978 and raising stock levels ofother anti-armour equipment.    The decision to buy TOW, the helicopter-borne missile,will advance by two years a major improvement in anti-*8^&apos;capability.   Additional armoured, artillery and infantry units areto be made available as reinforcements, and improvements are being planned for reserve mobilisation and the reinforcement of theBritish Army of the Rhine (BAOR).   In addition the rundown in Armymanpower has been reduced by 1900 men to compensate for the effects of continuing emergency commitments, especially in Northern Ireland;this will make it possible to improve readiness and to raise standard3of training in NATO-assigned units.   The Royal Air Force will be
building up its medium-range air-to-air missiles and war reservestocks of sonobuoys, increasing the wartime strength of RAFRegiment field squadrons in central Europe, markedly improving the rates of utilisation of the Harrier, and pre-stocking equipment for selected reinforcement squadrons.    Several of these measures areimprovements or additions to NATO&apos;s proposals.    In addition theUnited Kingdom continues to play a substantial part in the programmeof joint NATO exercises.Alliance Co-operation133. The 1977 BPC Ministerial Guidance stresses that NATO&apos;resources will be employed to the best effect if, in the develop-ment of national plans and programmes, full account is taken ofthe collective needs of the Alliance.   The United Kingdom sharesthis view, participates fully in Alliance collaborative activities,and attaches the highest importance to the efforts the Alliance is making to increase standardisation and interoperability of equipment.134. Working within the framework of the Alliance, the Eurogroupcontinues to provide an important forum for strengthening theEuropean contribution.   Eurogroup sub-groups are making steady progress in co-operation on logistic support, battlefield communica-tions, harmonisation of tactical concepts, training and medical services.   The independent European Programme Group (EPG), which is recognised by all its members as the main forum for equipmentcollaboration in Europe, is also making steady progress. Itmaintains a schedule of member countries&apos; requirements for equipmentover the next 15 years to help identify possibilities for
collaboration, and has set up eleven project groups   to studypossible future projects including tactical combat aircraft,helicopters and anti-tank weapons.135.     Another example of Alliance-wide co-operation is the NATOinfrastructure programme, which covers fixed installations needed for the deployment and operation of the armed forces.   NATO defence ministers agreed in May 1977 to additional funding for the 1975-79period so that a bigger programme will be financed on a NATO basisaccording to the agreed cost-sharing formula.   The main elements of the NATO programme are airfields, including hardened sheltersfor protecting aircraft; communications, including the developmentof the NATO integrated system to facilitate political consultation and improve command and control by the NATO military authorities;the NATO Air Defence Ground Environment, covering the whole of NATOEurope, for early warning of and response to hostile aircraft andmissiles; and an oil pipeline system from Atlantic and Mediterraneanports to airfields and other installations.UNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTION TO NATO13 6.    The United Kingdom contributes to each of the elements of nato&apos;s triad of forces and to each major NATO Commander. our military effort is mainly directed to the four areas where we can best help Alliance defence - the defence of the United Kingdom &amp;and its immediate approaches; the eastern Atlantic and Channel;Central Region of Europe; and NATO&apos;s nuclear capability:
a..     The United Kingdom base provides vital support for British forces assigned to NATO, including reinforce-ments for Allied Command Europe (ACE) and aircraft ofRAF Strike Command available to support operations by all three Major NATO Commanders.    It also provides basefacilities for United States forces stationed in thiscountry or brought in as reinforcements.The United Kingdom contributes by far the largestpart of NATO&apos;s readily available maritime forces in theeastern Atlantic and Channel.    In addition to Nimrod&quot;Maritime patrol, Buccaneer strike/attack, Phantom air-defence and Vulcan and Canberra reconnaissance aircraft,virtually the whole of the Royal Navy - the thirdlargest in the world - is assigned to NATO. .*     In the Central Region of Europe the United KingdomProvides the 55,000 men of BAOR, which can be more than doubled in an emergency.   BAOR is equipped with over600 Chieftain tanks and over 2,000 other armoured fighting vehicles.    In addition, twelve squadrons of RAF aircraft are based in Germany in the strike/attack, tacticalReconnaissance, air-defence and support roles. these forces play a vital role in not&apos;s forward defence.The United Kingdom provides theatre nuclear forcesdeployed by all three Services and also contributes with&quot;the Polaris force to not&apos;s strategic nuclear capability.
137. British forces also make an important contribution to the strategic Reserve of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)including the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF), land and aircontributions to the ACE Mobile Force (AMP), and three regularsquadrons of the Special Air Service.   Royal Marines Commandoforces provide reinforcements primarily for NATO&apos;s Northern Region-138. The equipment of all these forces is being constantlyimproved.   The first of a new class of anti-submarine cruisersfor the Royal Navy, HMS Invincible, was launched in May 1977* anda second is being built.   There is a continuing construction programme of nuclear-powered fleet submarines, with nine now in service, a tenth due to enter service shortly, three more being built, including the first of the new Trafalgar class, andthe second of this class due to be ordered this year.   The RoyslN8vy is the only European NATO navy to operate nuclear-poweredfleet submarines.   The Navy&apos;s older frigates and destroyers arebeing replaced by three new classes, the Type 21 and Type 22 frig0and the Type 42 destroyer, and older minesweepers and minehunters ^Yadvanced Hunt class mine countermeasure vessels. Complementingthese new ship classes are new weapons and equipments includingthe Sea Dart and Sea Wolf guided-missile systems, and Sea Harrieraircraft.139. For the Army, a new 155mm field howitzer, the FH70, is being produced in collaboration with the Federal Republic of Germany 0ll(*Italy, and a self-propelled version, the SP70, is in jointdevelopment.   The Franco-German Milan anti-tank missile is being
**0cured, together with the American TOW for the helicopter-borne^--tank role.   The British anti-aircraft missile systems, Rapierme man-portable Blowpipe, are in service in BAOR. FurtherMovements are being made to Chieftain main battle tank.The main feature of the RAF equipment programme is thec^uisition of 385 Tornado multi-role combat aircraft.    In March^ the decision was taken to develop the Nimrod airborne early8tni^8 (AEW) aircraft, which are planned to be interoperable with, andElementary to, whatever AEW system the rest of the Alliance8*   The maritime patrol Nimrods will be extensively re-equippedbye early 1980s and the Royal Air Force will also get improved-range air-to-air missiles (Sidewinder AIM 9L) and a new anti-snip missile.New medium-range air-to-air missiles (Skyflash)a*e al*-^eady in production.-further details of equipment programmes are given in^ 3.   On the latest NATO figures the United Kingdom spent8 higher proportion of her defence budget (21.8%) on majorquipment in 1977 than any other of the eleven Allies coveredby the survey.   We also maintain a wide-ranging research and0Pment programme, accounting for      13%     of the defence budget.UNITED KINGDOM DEFENCE BUDGETAt the end of 1976 the Government decided that defence musttowards the reductions in public expenditure required tolQrs       en the United Kingdom economy.    The defence budget forWas reduced by  230 million, equivalent to  267 million at
1977 Survey prices.   The Government undertook to consult NATOabout how to make the savings with the minimum adverse effecton our front-line contribution to the Alliance and its essentialsupport.   Detailed proposals were put to NATO in June, and inAugust there were staff discussions between the Ministry of Defendand NATO.    In September Alliance views were conveyed to theGovernment by the NATO Secretary-General.   The Alliance expressed concern at the cumulative effect of successive reductions in thedefence budget, but acknowledged the Governments success in keeping to a minimum the effect of the  267 million reduction onour contribution to front-line forces.14-3*     In reply, the Government welcomed the Alliance&apos;s agreemen to the method of making the saving, and emphasised the largecontinuing contribution made by the United Kingdom to the AllianceAs Figure 5 shows, United Kingdom defence expenditure in 1977accounted for 4.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) at market pricecompared with 5-1% the previous year.   Figure 5 also shows NATOcountries1 defence expenditure in dollar terms.    These statisticSuse market exchange rates, which do not necessarily reflect the true relative purchasing powers of individual currencies and soare not a complete guide to comparative resource allocation to144.     The proposals put to the Alliance for achieving the ^ ^)(reduced to  261M as a result of the 1977 Public Expenditure Sur ^were refined during the course of scrutiny of 1978/79 Estimates- Q^eh8lf of the saving will come from the equipment programme, a&quot;00fifth from works and accommodation stores, and the balancemiscellaneous changes including offset receipts (see paragr8Pn
For the years after 1978/79 the Government proposes to respond^0sitively to NATO&apos;s call for increased resources for defence and to meettlle target set for increased expenditure in 1979/80.   Plans for future6Vels of defence expenditure agreed  in the 1977 Public ExpenditureVey and published in Cmnd   704-9      provide for increases in defence budget of 3% in 1979/80 compared with the previous year,Jurther 3% in 1980/81.   The provision for 1980/81 is subjectto pev.Vlew in the 1978 Public Expenditure Survey in the light of1[Qic circumstances.

FIGURE 6COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE NATO^       Aae Armed Forces also meet the commitments of the United^0ln Government outside NATO, including those which involvethecUrity of dependent territories.   Units of the Army and theA -lr Force provide a garrison for the external defence oft ana a Royal Marines detachment remains in the FalklandJ-n the Far East units of all three Services provide an for the security of Hong Kong and a Gurkha battalion isned in Brunei. In the Mediterranean, British forces are8tati0ned in Gibraltar, in Malta until 1979, and in Cyprus to meet
our commitment to the United Nations Force and to provide forthe security of the Sovereign Base Areas.    Ships and aircraft of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force deploy outside the NA&apos;area from time to time and take part in exercises with othercountries.    In 1977, it was necessary for forces to be deployedrapidly to Belize and to Bermuda.
BAT FORCES, DEPLOYMENTS,OPERATIONS AND EXERCISESNATOROYAL NAVY GENERAL PURPOSE COMBAT FORCES201.     Freedom of the Atlantic is vital to the security of NATOand the United Kingdom.   All the United Kingdom&apos;s major ships andamphibious forces are therefore assigned to NATO and would, intime of tension or war, be concentrated in the eastern atlantic and Channel areas.   In addition to important air-defence and anti-surface ship roles, their task would he to meet the threatfrom the large Soviet submarine fleet, an increasing proportionQf which is nuclear-powered, to ensure that important supply routeskept open and that Allied reinforcements get through. their task also includes meeting the threat of mines in coastal waters and keeping open the submarine deployment routes.   United Kingdom&quot;aval forces are under the command of Commander-in-Chief Fleet, whois also a major NATO Commander as the Commander-in-Chief Channel,ano a subordinate NATO Commander (to the Supreme Allied CommanderAtlantic) as the Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic.202-     The activities of Soviet naval and air forces operatingaround the United Kingdom, in the Atlantic and in the MediterraneanContinue t0 be monitored by ships and aircraft of the Royal Navy9nd the Royal Air Force.    In spring 1977 this task included thes*veinance, in conjunction with our NATO Allies, of the largeSoviet exercise in the northern Atlantic and the Norwegian andBaltic Seas.1
203. Ships of the Hydrographic Survey Fleet have carried outsurveys to meet specific defence requirements, to improve both our own and NATO&apos;s maritime operational capability and to enhancethe safety of international navigation.204. The Royal Marines Commando forces, as a result of thedecision not to disband 4-1 Commando, now consist of a brigade headquarters and four Commandos with combat, helicopter andlogistic support.THE NUCLEAR STRATEGIC FORCE205. The United kingdom&apos;s Polaris submarines, HM3 Renown, RepuiResolution and Revenue, between them maintain a continuous patroland constitute an integral part of not*s strategic nuclear force.ARMY COMBAT FORCES206.     The Army combat forces consist of the Regular Army and,after mobilisation, the Regular Reserves and Territorial and ArtnyVolunteer Reserve (TAVR).   The Regular Reserves comprise ex-SerVipersonnel who are, for a specified period after their return to civilian life, liable for recall in an emergency.   The TAVR cons1of men and women, not necessarily with previous Regular Armyservice, who have accepted liability for mobilisation in anemergency.2
207. Some 70% of the Regular and Reserve army will, in time of*ar, be deployed to the European mainland, and most of theremainder will remain to defend the United Kingdom.   Not onlyis the protection of the United Kingdom of the greatest importance^ itself, but it is vital for the reinforcement and support of forces deployed on the mainland of Europe and as a base from which to conduct maritime and air operations.208. Improved arrangements for the recall of Army Regular^servists are under examination which would significantly reducethe time required for their mobilisation.feitish Army of the Rhine209. First (British) Corps (1 (BS) Corps) is the main combat^ment of BAOR and forms part of the Northern Army Group (NORTHAG)**ich, as part of Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT), isPeeponsible for a vital sector of the Central Region. The^organisation of 1 (BR) Corps referred to in detail in previousSt*tements on the Defence Estimates will have, for the most part,t8*en place by 1 April 1978 and will be complete by 1 April 1979.1 (BR) corps will then consist in peace-time of four armouredVisions, an artillery division and the 5th Field Force (lesscertain elements),^ jin Field Force210-   The Berlin Field Force, some 3,000 strong, is not assignedt0 NATO but fulfils the United Kingdom commitment to the security0f the Western sectors of Berlin.3
United Kingdom Land Forces211.   The reorganisation of the United Kingdom Land Forces (UKLF)mentioned in last ye8r&apos;s Statement on the Defence Estimates willbe virtually complete by 1 April 1978.    The 8th Field Force becameoperational on 1 April 1977 and the 6th and 7th Field Forcesassume their operational roles on 1 April 1978.    The elements ofthe Regular Army based in the United Kingdom, the Regular reserves and the TAVR will then fulfil the following roles: .     Reinforcement of BAOR to its war establishment.The reinforcements include the 7th Field Force;other units stationed in the United Kingdom inpeace-time including certain TAVR units; individual5from the training and support organisation; anda part of the Regular Reserves,b.     Contribution to SACEURfs Strategic Reserve andto SACLANT.    The Army&apos;s contribution to SACEUH1sStrategic Reserve is available for deploymentthroughout ACE and consists of: some 1,800 menas the United Kingdom contribution to the landcomponent of the AMF; the land component of theUKMF, comprising the 6th Field Force and theLogistic Support Group; and the 22 Special AirService Regiment.    In addition the Army providessupport and logistic troops for the royal marine Commando forces assigned to SACLANT.4
 .     Defence of the United Kingdom.   Each Districtwithin the United Kingdom contains forces,drawn from the Regular Army and the TAVR, which,together with the 8th Field Force, have specificresponsibilities for the protection of vitalNATO and national installations and bases.Manpower released from the training and supportorganisation together with the remainder of theRegular Reserves will further supplement these forces on mobilisation.ROYAL AIR FORCE COMBAT FORCESRAF combat forces are organised in two operational commands -S*ike Command, whose Commander-in-Chief also holds the NATO*PPointment of Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Air Forces, andGermany, whose Commander-in-Chief is b^J^JJJ;^ ^***nd Allied Tactical Air Force which is part of allied forces Central Europe.

Emphasis has also again been placed on the^ain -Qlng of Regular and TAVR soldiers from the United Kingdom,and i vjQls year over 40,000 of them trained on the European mainland.ecent measure to improve the value of exercises has been a study7
designed to make better use of expensive resources by integratingnational and NATO exercises.Eastern Atlantic Area217. An important NATO maritime exercise, OCEAN SAFARI 77, w8Sstaged last October in the Iberlant and Eastlant areas and south-west approaches to the United Kingdom.   The United kingdom contribution to this exercise comprised 16 warships, includingHMS Ark Royal,   HMS Hermes and the frigate assigned to theStanding Naval Force in the Atlantic, together with eight RoyalFleet Auxiliaries and 13 RAF squadrons.    The exercise was designto demonstrate NATO&apos;s determination and ability to retain controlof sea lanes vital to this country and to the reinforcement 01Europe.Northern Region218. The 6th Field Force and the United Kingdom contingent 01AMF participated in Exercise ARROW EXPRESS in Denmark in Septem^1977, practising co-operation between the Danish Army and extereinforcements.       Similarly, the United Kingdom will take par^in Exercise ARCTIC EXPRESS in March 1978, demonstrating NATO&apos;sel &amp;ability to reinforce the northern flank.    The Royal Navy, R0?ines, the Army and the Royal Air Force will all be involved,exercising winter warfare techniques which have been practiseNorway previously.Central Region219. BAOR units have participated in three NATO and ten nati011exercises each involving two or more battlegroups.   The annual8
Central Region air exercise, COLD FIRE 77, took place last september.   All RAF squadrons in Germany together with some UnitedKingdom-based squadrons were involved, and the United Kingdom air defence Region was fully tested.Southern Region220. All three Services took part in Exercise DAWN PATROL 77 inthe Mediterranean.   Naval, air and amphibious forces were involvedin the region-wide Exercise DISPLAY DETERMINATION 77 to practiseexternal reinforcement to the region and the transfer of command of naval forces across NATO command boundaries.    In November 1977Exercise AVON EXPRESS, which involved contingents of the AMF fromfive NATO countries, was held on Salisbury Plain.   UKLF provided a comprehensive support organisation including elements of the 6thField Force as exercise enemy forces.Other Exercises in support of NATO221. The United Kingdom has contributed to a wide range of smallerexercises in support of NATO ranging from the western Atlantic tothe northern flank and eastern Mediterranean.   As a means ofproviding maritime training for both our own and NATO forces, theRoyal Navy and Royal Air Force have also conducted a programme of joint maritime courses, well supported by our NATO Allies.    Royal Navymine-countermeasures forces and headquarters concerned with the navalcontrol of shipping have conducted a full programme of exercises,involving also the Royal Nsval Reserve, and the Royal Marines haveexercised with their counterparts in five NATO countries, includingarctic warfare training in Norway and three exercises with sub-units of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps.9
222. Despite the Army&apos;s continued commitment in Northern Irelandsix battlegroups from BAOR and one from UKLF carried out tacticsfiring exercises at Suffield in Canada.   Three battalion groupsfrom UKLF also exercised at Vainwright in Canada, one of themtaking part in 8 Canadian brigade exercise.   Army units hsve sis0exorcised in support of their NATO role in the United States, tbeFederal Republic of Germany, Denmark, Norway, Italy and France.These bilateral exercises have contributed towards better mutual understanding and co-operation, which will lead to improvedoperational efficiency within NATO.223. A RAF detachment of Buccaneer and Vulcan aircraft deployedto Nellis Air Force Base in the United States to use the Americ8n- this*edRed Flag range facilities, gaining valuable training in a simuhostile environment.    21 RAF squadrons based in the United Kingdand Federal Republic of Germany utilised the NATO squadron excb8scheme to improve operating techniques.   RAF air transport unialso held exercises with the American and Canadian air transporforces to practise joint procedures.UNITED KINGDOMOPERATIONSNorthern Ireland224.   The Governments policy for security in Northern IrelsD0*continues to be based on the development of the Royal Ulsterf iswConstabulary (RUC) as the instrument for the maintenance oi
end order.   The Armed Forces, including the Ulster DefenceRegiment (UDR), will remain ss the essential buttress of thisPolicy for as long as is necessary. TheAraed Forces have maintained their high standards of courage,resourcefulness and effectiveness and last year 20 awards for gallantry*ere made to personnel serving in Northern Ireland.225.   In June 1977 the Secretary of Stste for Northern Irelsndbounced measures to increase the effectiveness of the Government&apos;s security policy.   These included an increase in the full-timeestablishment of the UDR, a continuing build-up in the strength ofBUG, a greater emphasis on the acquisition of intelligence and strengthening of the laws against terrorist offences. There^s been a progressive reduction in the general level of violencea*ihg the year, with a marked fall in the number of civilianeasuauies and of shooting and bombing incidents,ana  increasing success in bringing law-breakers to justice.ln 197?   1308     people were charged with terrorist-type offences,deluding     266     with murder or attempted murder.   The securityfopoes found     590     firearms,  52,091    rounds of ammunition and2-?        tons of explosive (including neutralised devices),^ettably there has been no reduction in the scale of security&quot;0pceE deaths since        29    service personnel including 14&quot;e^erg of the ^ have given their lives.225&apos; Ul three Services of the Armed Forces are involved inGaining security, but the Army inevitably bears the main
responsibility for providing assistance and support to the policethough the Royal Marines have also been involved in the infantryrole.       The force level remained at around 14 major units of thecombat arms until early 1978 when it was reduced&apos; to 13.Reinforcements were called in as necessary to meet thesecurity requirements.   A major reinforcement of 3,000 men, inC^u(^ing three     infantry battalions, was deployed primarily by theRAP air transport force at the time of the     United UnionistAction Council (UUAC) strike in May 1977.   A total of 47major units served during 1977* Nine major units have now compIetesix tours of duty there and six units have completed seven tours-Coastal and lough patrols are carried out by the Royal Navy 8ndRoyal Marines to deter the smuggling of arms and the Royal AirForce provides reconnaissance facilities, and ,      together witDthe Royal Navy ,  personnel and logistic air transport support and tactical mobility for the security forces.    The RAF Regime^provides protection for the airfield at Aldergrove and for theradar unit at Bishop^ Court.227- . The strength of the UDR at 1 January 1978, including botbfull-time and part-time members, was 7,812 , of which 7^were women.    In addition to routine operations, the UDR continuto provide a company-size force each weekend for deployment sin the Province.    The UDR now provides immediate militarysupPorfor the RUC, wholly or in part, in     11     Police Divisions th^5
demonstrating the importance of this largely part-time body inthe maintenance of security in Northern Ireland,    In 1977 elements of five UDR battalions benefited from the greater range oftreining facilities available in Great Britain and it is planned to extend such training in 1978.   There were two general C8ll-upsfor the UDR during the year and the turn-out on each occasion was at a gratifying high level of well over 90%.   The actions of theUDR during the UUAC strike last May, in response to a generalcall-up, not only contributed materially to the maintenance oflaw and order during the strike but also enhanced the UDR&apos;sreputation for impartiality and effectiveness.further assistance to the civil power228. During the year Army bomb disposal teams     have continuedto be available to assist    local police forces     in the event of   bomb   incidents inGreat Britain.   A Joint force continues to be held at short notice to support the police in counter-terrorist operations at Heathrow Air-port and, at   the request of the Metropolitan Police,this force has taken part in seven exercises at Heathrow.Fire-fighting .229. On 1&apos;i- November 1977, personnel from all three Services weredeployed to assist the fire authorities in maintaining fire coverthroughout the United Kingdom during the firemen&apos;s strike.    At the peak of the operation, some 20,000 servicemen were involved. Theservicemen remained on duty until   mid-January    during which time they attended        39,612     incidents, and received considerablepraise from the fire officers supervising them for their success intackling an unfamiliar task.    Inevitably, the commitment of so manyman-hours to these duties caused considerable disruption to thenormal programme of Service training, and imposed additionalseparation on many Service families.13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALProtection of Offshore Installations230.    Ships and aircraft are deployed throughout the year forthe protection of offshore oil and gas installations.    They carryout air and sea surveillance and deterrent patrols and, togetherwith other forces in the area, are available to react swiftly toany emergency.    The security of offshore installations and the ability to provide assistance quickly are regularly tested inexercises conducted jointly by the Ministry of Defence and civil authorities.       Five     new Island class ships, ordered specif108for offshore protection tasks, are now in service together witbfour additional RAF Nimrod aircraft.   These can be augmented wnnecessary by other ships and aircraft.   The estimated costs of t erotection of offshore oil and gas installations and other offsDasks are shown in Table 5 of Annex A.Fishery Protection231. Since the extension of United Kingdom fishery limits on1 January 1977 the enlarged Fishery Protection task has beenperformed with considerable success.    In the twelve-mile belt?the Ton class minesweepers of the Coastal Division of the Fisker^a by fiProtection Squadron carry out their traditional task assistedIt **ewing; aircraft and, as necessary, helicopters.    Outside this Detask is now undertaken by Island class vessels and RAF Nimrodsurveillance patrols. The estimated costs of fishery protect!011other offshore tasks are shown in Table 5 of Annex A.Search and Rescue232. During 1977 RN and RAF helicopters participated in 130^search and rescue operations,many of which took place under extremely difficult and dangerconditions.        917     lives were saved and   four     awards for0^
8allantry and       one       commendation   for brave conduct were given0 the officers and men concerned.   The last of the RN Whirlwindlcopters were replaced by Wessex helicopters and plans are wellQced for the introduction of RAF Sea King helicopters for this  -Jjj-litary Aid to the Civil Communitythroughout 1977 all three Services carried out projects ofaB size and complexity.

Since the largest number of fighting unitsof the Army were stationed in Germany it was considered approprio&apos;tefor Her Majesty to review the British Army of the Rhine. Duringthe Review, which took place at Sennelager, Her Majesty was accompanied by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany,Herr Walter Scheel.236.    The centrepiece of Roy8l Air Force Silver Jubilee celebrati0llSwas the Review by Her Majesty at Finningley.    Six Queen1s Colours,68 squadron standards and 838 Service personnel paraded on theoccasion of the presentation of a new Queen1s Colour for the RoyalAir Force in the United Kingdom.    14-1 aircraft took part in aflying display representing the various roles and nearly everysquadron in the Royal Air Force and a further 7^- aircraft incl^di11^several from Commonwealth air forces were on static display. ^yaircraft also took part in a specially augmented Queen1s Birthdayfly-past over Buckingham Palace.237-   &quot;In June Her Majesty reviewed the Reserve and Cadet forces the Services Military Musical Pageant at Wembley.238.

RAF aircraft have also flown out emerbelectricity generating equipment to the Gambia.
Hydrography248. Major surveys are being carried out in Iranian waters onrepayment from the Iranian Government.    The task covers a periodof some three years, and is currently employing three ships ofthe Hydrographic Survey Fleet.   A survey of Marsaxlokk Bay hasbeen completed for the Maltese Government, and further coastalsurveys are taking place in Ghana under the hydrographic assistanceprogramme funded by the Ministry of Overseas Development.Divinp249. In May 1977 a RN diving team working in co-operation withEgyptian naval divers recovered the Gate of Diocletian from thearea flooded by the Aswan     High     Dam.   Further diving to recoverthe ruins of the Temple of Augustus Caesar began in October 1977and is expected to finish in April 1978.   Another RN diving teamassisted by Army and RAF bomb disposal experts has completed anassignment to clear unexploded wartime ordnance in the GilbertIslands and Tuvalu in the western Pacific.Oman250. With the exception of a small training team all direct assistance units were withdrawn from Oman during 1977.   Prior todeparture a Royal Engineer troop completed the road linking Dhofarto Dalquat, which was opened in December 1977.    The number of loanservice personnel in the Sultan of Oman&apos;s Forces is gradually being reduced as Omanis become available to occupy their positions.
EXERCISES251.     The total number of exercises outside the NATO area inwhich the Services participated during 1977 decreased.   While on passage RN groups have conducted exercises with naval forces ofthe United States, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, France,Australia and Brazil, and Royal Marine ship detachments have continued to train and exercise in various parts of the world.Army units have trained in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Brunei,Cyprus, Kenya, the Gambia, Sudan, the Caribbean and the UnitedStates, practising tactics and live-firing in challenging andunfamiliar terrain, and techniques of sea and air movement. Thesecond annual four-month individual exchange of Army personnel toolCplace between the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. 3a&quot;Faircraft from Malta joined the ships of the group deployment en route to the Far East to take part in the CENTO maritime exerciseMIDLINK off the coast of Iran.

301.EQUIPMENTExpenditure on equipment accounts for     approximately 40%of the defence budget, and is expected to amount to      2770 millicniG ^978/79.   By comparison (at the same price level) the expenditureRecast for 1977/78 was      2523 million.       Including associated**8onael and other costs, total procurement expenditure for 1978/79is estimated at     3060 million,     split up as follows:-FIGURE 7PRODUCTION  ^million (71%)research and DEVELOPMENT 876 million  9%)Including R&amp;D support costs e.g. headquarters expenses1
302. The      2184 million     to be spent on production of newequipment and spares can roughly be subdivided into: 31 %on ships, ship equipment and weapons;          26 % on Army equipment*nd vehicles;          34 % on aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and weapons; and         9%       on general support.    Of the 2184     million    ,    over  1900 million will be spent with Britishindustry and the Royal Ordnance Factories.303. Total R&amp;D expenditure at      876   million represents13% of the overall defence budget and compares (at thesame price level) with forecast expenditure of    869 million in 1977/78.        608 million     of the R&amp;D figure will be spentextramurally.INDUSTRIAL AND EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS OF THE EQUIPMENT304.     In 1976/77, the Ministry of Defence spent      2138 millioD0tit?00on defence equipment. Of this about 70% was spent on national cplaced with British industry, about 20% as our share of collab0projects and about 10% on contracts placed overseas.      Of thepayments made   directly by the Ministry of Defence to contractor-45in the United Kingdom the bulk, about  1,600million,    went     to the     38     firms (including the Royal Ordna^cFactories), listed at Annex H 8s each receiving more thanmillion.305.     The defence equipment programme generates directly the equivalent of about 200,000 full-time job opportunities, an0
Ver,seas sales generate about     70,000     more, in the defencen^ustries^   Roughly the same numbers again are generated inndustry generally in support of the manufacture of defencee^puent.The defence equipment programme is therefore large enoughitself to be of considerable economic and industrial signifi-Cance.The nature of the programme tends to concentrate the^nditure   in particular industries.   For instance we estimate at)out half of those employed in the aerospace industry are on military work including work for export, and warship-ln6 accounts for up to a third of those employed in the8kipbui 1 a -AJ.Qing industry.    Defence work v/ill continue to be a major factor ^An sustaining the levels of employment and technologicallse in British Aerospace, British Shipbuilding and other importantiated sectors of industry, notably electronics.Given these substantial effects, the Ministry ofrecognises the need to take the industrial implications0f eq -development programmes into account in making procurementns, though the primary objective of defence procurement musteQsure that the equipment needs of the Services are met inbethetimely and cost-effective manner.50qINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONThe rowing complexity and cost of each new generation ofa^ makes increasingly heavy demands on R &amp; D capacityU(iEets throughout the Alliance.   No European NATO country
con in these circumstances afford to develop from its own resourcesall its armed forces&apos; requirements.   New systems must be built to operate in conjunction with others in NATO, snd in some cases it isdesirable for them to be standardised.    In addition, unit costs arevery high if the production is limited to our national requirement.There       is        thus a continuing need to see how far our ownServices1 requirements can be met through co-operative procure-ment arrangements with our Allies, for example, by collaboration in individual projects, which will ensble us to maintain theessential range of R &amp; D capabilities and to share in the develop-ment of more equipments than we could achieve from nationalprojects alone.309*     International co-operation in this complex field raisesdifficult problems.    Operational requirements and time scales bothneed   to   be agreed; the industrial arrangements need to be satisfactory for each participating country; bal8nce-of-tradeconsiderations arising from reciprocal sales and purchases mustbe taken into account; and the need in the long term to maintainadequate R&amp;D capabilities has to be borne in mind.310.     The United Kingdom is taking a leading part in the efforto overcome the problems and make co-operation more effective,particularly in Europe.   We are active members of the independentEPG which is concentrating on a number of important projects,especially in the aircraft and missile fields.   These offeropportunities for collaboration in the development stage of m0jprojects, co-operation in production, manufacture under licenceand direct sales and purchases.   At the North Atlantic Summit
&quot;meeting in London in May 1977 President Carter welcomed theinitiatives taken by the EPG in Europe, and undertook that theUnited States would seek increased opportunities to buy european defence equipment.   For its part, the EPG has proposed to theUnited States and Canada that they should jointly examine a numberof means to improve the imbalance in trade between Europe and north America in the defence equipment sector, and as a resulttechnical discussions between the EPG and the United States and^anada are under way.PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENTROYAL NAVYfe-     Ships  ******** ertt *e lob-ro no *** ae,a..

This medium-range surface-to-air guidedweapon system is now fitted in three ships, and isexpected to be accepted into operational service this year.   A programme is under way for an improved Sea Dart system and supporting radarsto increase its air-defence capabilities to meetthe expected threat in the mid to late 1980&apos;s.b.     Sea Wolf.   The intensive series of sea trials onboard HMS Penelope proved highly successful and production of both missile and ship system has begun.    The weapon system is in advance of all8
others of its type and will provide the Type 22frigate and other ships with a close-range self-defence capability against missiles and aircraft.A programme of improvements is in hand to main-tain the capability of Sea Wolf in the face ofexpected developments in the threat.Anti-Surface Ship WeaponsSub-Harpoon.   Negotiations were completed withthe United States Government last October for thefull development of Sub-Harpoon, a submarine-launched, air flight long-range anti-ship missilewhich will provide the main anti-surface shiparmament of our submarine fleet from the early 1980s.^*     Sea Skua.   This anti-ship missile is expected toenter service in the early 1980&apos;s.    Carried by theLynx helicopter, it is intended to provide destroyers andfrigates with an attack capability stretching far beyond their horizon.NATO Anti-Surface Ship Missile.

The large majority ofthe surface fleet will be fitted with computer-based action information systems together withdigital data links by the mid-1980s.ARMYArmoured Forces .*     Chieftain.   Work on the planned improvements tomaintain and enhance the effectiveness ofChieftain into the 1980s is going ahead. Inaddition to latest marks of the tank laser sight,units will also this year begin to receive themuzzle reference system.   A number of modifica-tions to improve the reliability of the mainengine are being incorporated into the fleet.
b.     Chieftain Replacement (MBT 80).   The Anglo-Germancollaborative studies on a future main battle tankwere terminated in March last year.   Although therewas a large measure of agreement on the details ofthe requirement, both countries felt that collabor-ative development and production would not bepossible, mainly because the time scales in which each country required the replacement tank becameincompatible during the course of the joint work.National studies on the best way of meeting ourrequirement for a tank to be in service by thelate 1980s are now in progress, and these willmake use of the valuable work carried out duringthe joint concept studies. .     Mechanised Infantry Combat Vehicle.   The second phase of project definition for a mechanisedinfantry combat vehicle, to replace part of thepresent FV430 series of armoured personnelcarriers in the 1980s, began in August last yesr.Project definition has also begun on a series ofvariants.ck     Tracked Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles.   Two moreveriants in the series are now entering service -Striker, which carries the swing fire anti-tankguided weapon system, and the command vehicle,Sultan.

Helicopter-borne Anti-Tank Guided Weapon. following the evaluation of the Franco-German HOT and theAmerican TOW systems, the Ministry of Defenceannounced in August last year that TOW is to beadopted snd will enter service with the Army Lynxhelicopter in the early 1980s.   A substantial psrtof the equipment will be manufactured under licencein the United Kingdom. .     swing fire Long-Range Anti-Tank Guided Weapon.Development is continuing of a thermal-imagingnight sight for swing fire.   Discussions have alsobegun with France and the Federal Republic ofGermany on the requirement for e third-generationlong-range anti-tank guided weapon.d.     Milan Medium-Range Anti-Tank Guided Weapon.    It hasbeen possible to accelerate delivery of the initialbatch of Milan equipments being bought from the franco-German consortium, Euroraissile. deliveries of this batch began last year and will be spreadover two years.       Development of a thermal-imagingnight sight for Milan has begun on a collaborativetripartite basis between the United Kingdom, theFederal Republic of Germany and France.
Other Army EquipmentLip;ht Anti-Armour Weapon.   Froject definition beganlast year on a man-portable anti-armour weapon toreplace the 84mm C8rl Gustav recoil-less rifle andand 66mm M72 rocket.    Discussions are taking place within the EPG on the possibilities of collaboration.h.     Small Arms.    NATO technical trials to select a standard calibre for future snail arms began lastyear, and military tests will begin later this year.The new British 4.85mm weapon system, comprising an automatic rifle and light support weapon, has been entered in the trials and the results should beavailable by the end of next year.Mines.   The Barmine anti-tank mine is new in serviceand work began last year to develop additional fusesto extend its operational application and improveits resistance to countermeasures.   The complementaryoff-route mine and the Ranger scatterable anti-personnel mine system will enter service later thisyear.5.* Electronic Warfare. In July last year, an electronic-warfare regiment took its place in the order of b8ttleof 1 (BR) Corps.    Most of its equipment will be british, although some is being bought from France.Further improvements in our electronic warfarecapability are under consideration.
e.      Lynx Helicopter.    Intensive flying trials of theArmy version of Lynx have been completed, and thehelicopter is expected to enter service in themiddle of this year, replacing the Scout.jf.     Vehicles.   The introduction of a range of low-mobility vehicles - a basic cargo carrier, withtipper,  fuel tanker and recovery variants - is proceeding according to plan.   A main contractorhas been chosen by competitive tender for theproduction of an 8-tonne medium-mobility loadcarrier which, together with its variants, willform the backbone of the Armyfs future logisticfleet. .     Communications.   The Ptarmigan tactical trunkcommunications system, which will replace thepresent Bruin system, has now entered the final stages of development.   Ptarmigan has been designedto conform with standards agreed in the communica-tions sub-group of the Eurogroup, to enable futuretrunk systems to be fully interoperable.h.     Automatic Data Processing; (ADP) System. Trialswill be carried out in BAOR of a new command andcontrol ADP system, V/avell.    If these trials are successful it is planned eventually to equip allformation headquarters in 1 (BR) Corps with Vavellto assist them in data-handling.
i,.     Logistic Landing craft.   Two newly-built logisticlanding craft hsve been launched.   HMAV ArdennesW86 commissioned in December last year and HMAVArakan will be commissioned in August this year.These vessels will provide peacetime logistic support to the Hebrides and logistic support forthe reinforcement of Europe in war.ROYAL AIR FORCENew Aircraft,a.     Tornado GR1.   First deliveries of production aircraft,of which 150 have so far been ordered, are expectednext year.   The variable geometry configuration willconfer great operational flexibility and permit a combination of high-speed low-level flight, goodrange and an excellent take-off and landing perform-ance.   The tri-national flight test programme hadamassed some 1,500 hours by the end of 1977, and testdata indicate that Service requirements will be met.Tornado F2.   The Tornado F2 air-defence variant isnow in full development with the first of threedevelopment aircraft under construction.    It willhave an excellent loiter capability and its armamentwill include Sky Flash medium-range and AIM9L short-
range air-to-air missiles, and cannon. Thefirst phase of the airborne trials of an important new air-intercept radar for the Tornado F2 hasbeen completed and the second phase, to demonstratefull mission capability, will being shortly.Nimrod AEW.   Full development is under way to convert eleven Nimrod aircraft to the AEW role.They will enter service progressively in the early1980s, replacing the Shackleton.    Mission systemavionics will be developed and integrated into a modified Nimrod airframe.   The main features ofthe system will be 8 new radar, electronic supportmeasures, &quot;identification friend or foe&quot; interro-gators, 8n integrated data-handling system andassociated communications equipment.   The aircraft is planned to be interoperable to the maximum extent possible with other NATO airborne early warning systems.The Harrier/Jaguar successor.    Studies of variousdesigns for an aircraft to replace the Harrier andJaguar are continuing with the aim of combininga capability for battlefield attack and for aircombat in one airframe.   The possibility of developing such an aircraft collaboratively isbeing explored with a number of potential partners in the EPG.
Support Helicopters.     It is intended to meet the Army1requirement for medium-lift helicopter support bythe purchase of Boeing-Vertol CH-14-7 Chinookhelicopters from the United States.   The helicopterswould be equipped with British equipment, where appropriate, to ensure commonality with equipmentalready in service with the Royal Air Force. Atthe same time a number of Wessex helicopters wouldbe withdrawn from the front-line and transferredto other roles, or placed in reserve.Sea King Search end Rescue Helicopters.   The first of the Sea King search and rescue helicopters havebeen delivered to the Royal Air Force.   They willenter service during the year and the Whirlwindsthey replace will be withdrawn.Aircraft in ServiceNimrod Maritime Reconnaissance (MR) Aircraft. the major refit of Nimrod long-range maritime patrolaircraft is now in hand and flight trials of theacoustic processor start this year.   The firstrefitted Nimrod MR2s with the processor, the associated active attack and long-range passivesonobuoys, and the Searchwater ridar   are due toenter service next year.   The refit is to becompleted by the mid-1980&apos;s.
Harrier. An order for a further PA aircraft hasbeen placed and deliveries should start nextyear.   The feasibility of fitting a new improvedwing to the aircraft is also under study.c. Jap;uar.   Work is in hand to increase the take-offthrust and the time between overhauls of the AdourIlk 102 engine.   Reconnaissance pods containingBritish infr8-red linescan and camera equipmentare now being fitted.d. Puma.   The fleet will be progressively up-datedby modifications to improve performance and extendcomponent life, and by the introduction of fibre-composite main rotor blades and an ice and snowprotection   system.    Delivery of an advancedtactical navigation system is planned to take placethis year.j3.     Phantom.   Work has begun on a programme to improve the combat capability of the Phantom to maintain 8high level of operational effectiveness until it isreplaced by the Tornado F2 in the mid 1980*s.323.    Aircraft Weapons .     Air-to-Air Missiles.   The Sky Flash medium-rangeair-to-8ir missile, to be carried by the Phantom an
the Tornado F2, is        entering full production.Requirements for future short-rsnge air-to-airmissiles for the Phantom and Tornado F2 will bemet by the procurement of AIM9L missiles most ofwhich, subject to satisfactory negotiation, willbe manufactured by a European consortium of whichthe United Kingdom will be a member.Air-to-Surface Weapons.   Project definition has begun of the British Aerospace P3T anti-ship sea-skimming missile, which will be fitted to theBuccaneer in the early 1980s to replace TV Marteland will later be carried by those Tornado GR1swhich operate in the maritime strike/attack role.P3T will have a considerably longer range thanMartel, will be guided by active radar to provide an all-weather day and night capability and willbe able to penetrate the enemy1s electroniccountermeasures (ECM) defences.    During the yearAmerican laser-guidance kits to improve the accuracy of RAF 1,000 lb high-explosive bombs and laser-designator pods for use on Buccaneers will be delivered.   Agreement in principle has been reached with the United States for the co-operative develop-ment of an advanced airfield attack system. Otherweapons projects include studies of anti-armour and defence-suppression weapons, planned to enter service in the 1980s.
CONFIDENTIAL324.    Ground-Based Air-Defence EquipmentRapier. The Rapier systemsnow in service with the RAF Regiment sre being fitted with the Blindfire tracking radar, DN 181.   A study of further improvements is under way (see para 319a)&apos;The United Kingdom Air-Defence Ground Environment(UKADGE).   The planned programme of improvements toUKADGE, which is receiving NATO funding support, isnow well advanced   and development work will beginthis year.   Work is also in hand to re-equip anumber of early warning stations.325.    Other Electronicsa. &quot;Identification Frieni or Foe&quot; (IFF). Feasibilitystudies are in progress in order to define a replace-ment IFF system with NATO-wide application.b. Communications.   High-speed data communications areplanned for the transfer of information required byfuture command and control systems.   Project defini-tion h8s begun on the exchange of digital d8tabetween fighters, AEV aircraft, ships and UKADGE,and the feasibility of introducing a general purposeground communication system, using digital trans-mission and computer switching techniques, is being investigated.   New very-high frequency (VHF) andultra-high frequency (UHF) airborne radio systems8.b.
are being installed in most RAF aircraft to replaceobsolescent equipment and to satisfy revisedinternational compatibility standards; new VHFand UHF ground radios are also being introduced.Techniques to improve beyond-li:;c-of-sight radiosystems are being studied and the installation ofa new HF radio ground/air network for Strike command aircraft bas begun.        The United Kingdom is co-operating closely with its Allies to ensure that,v/here necessary, future communications systems areinteroperable.Electronic Warfare.   Passive radar warning equipment is being fitted in a variety of combat aircraft and active ECM equipment is planned to be fitted in the TornadoGR1 and the Jaguar GR1.   ECM for the Harrier are 8lsobeing studied,-^ her Development ProgrammesWo?k is continuing on improving engine safety, efficiency and^iabii^&quot;*&quot;Aty and on reducing costs.

RESEARCH327. The defence research programme is carried oat both in R &amp; Destablishments and under outside contracts.It covers a wide range of activities extending from the generationand assessment of new ideas to experimental work and exploratorydevelopment undertaken to the point where an operational stafftarget is formulated against which feasibility studies and full-scale development of specific projects can be initiated.    One ofthe main objectives of defence research, accounting for about two-thirds of the expenditure, is the removal of major scientific and technical uncertainties before heavy expenditure is committed to development.   The remaining one-third of the expenditure isconcerned with maintaining an adequate scientific and technologicalbase to meet future military needs.    In 1978/79 research is expectedto cost      129 million.328. The Ministry of Defence also manages programmes of research and technology on behalf of the Department of Industry and theCivil Aviation Authority.    In many cases these are run as separatecivil programmes; in others, joint programmes aimed at military 8J3^civil objectives are possible.   The total effort involved continue5to reduce.    In each case an appropriate share of the costs is met ^by the civil authority concerned.   In addition,   some of the facil1and capabilities required in establishments for defence purpose^y^c AO0serve the civil research needs of public and industrial concernswork on repayment is carried out on their behalf.   Total receipt^ ^both sources are estimated to be     24     million     in 1978/79*the creation of British Aerospace in 1977, some re-arrangement 0responsibilities, especially on non-defence work, will be requireand the implications, including those for defence R&amp;D estabHsare being examined.f the329. As a result of the Management Review the headquarters 01Controller R&amp;D Establishments and Research (CER) are being ^reorganised.   The main feature is the delegation to R &amp; D establ1^ments of responsibilities for the detailed formulation, mane6enieri
*nd co-ordination of extramural and intramural research programmes,*ith overall policy and control exercised by the reduced and^organised headquarters under CER.530.    Following the announcement in the 1977 Statement on the Defence^timates that a separate defence establishment was not required0* Microbiological research, the Central Policy Review Staff andthe Medical Research Council have carried out studies of theci*il requirements for the Microbiological Research establishment at Porton.   The Government is considering the future of*E as a civil establishment in the light of the studies. any proposals will be the subject of consultations with the staff associations and Trade Unions concerned.ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES331. m,-Ltie Royal Ordnance Factories organisation is now in itsyear of operation under a trading fund.   This method ofailcing, together with extensions to the delegated powers grantede introduction, provides the means for it to continue toilal*ovpmotivation and efficiency and extend the scope of its0p6*atixons.   The organisation continues to meet its financiallve and to make some provision for reserves.   Besides meetingds of the Services over a wide range of defence equipment,
andit is broadening the base of its overseas business both in numberof overseas customers and its range of defence equipment.332. During 1978/79 its cash receipts are expected to rise tosome  370 million, of which well over half will be from exports.Equipment manufactured during the year will include armoured fighting vehicles, both heavy and light, and including main battletanks; the 105       light gun; the combat engineer tractor; small arms; a v/ide variety of ammunition; fuses; explosives and propcomponents for use by British industry; and spares of all kinds.The scope of design and development work also continues to widenin close collaboration with the Ministry&apos;s R&amp;D establishmentswith British industry, and international collaboration in thedevelopment and production of equipment continues to be fostered-333. An increased capital investment programme is to be underta^in order to maintain the standard of plant and buildings requirto introduce new techniques and processes; and to meet requirfor new equipment.   The future computer requirements of theorganisation are also under review, and steps are being taken t0introduce appropriate changes in accounting practice in prepenfor the expected adoption of current cost accounting.334. The size of the overall manufacturing programme is expecto require a slightly increased work force in 1978/79* training will continue to be given strong emphasis, particularly coursesd^relating to management and safety. The number of apprenticestraining is again expected to increase, to meet the requiremeskilled men.ed jetoents
DEFENCE SALESOverseas sales of defence equipment and associated servicesCover a wide range of items produced by British industry and by^ne Royal Ordnance Factories, with the Defence Sales OrganisationProviding support, assistance and advice.   These sales continue toBla^e 6 substantial contribution to the country&apos;s balance of payments.&quot;Shipment sales will probably amount to at least  900 million in1978/79.
4MANPOWERRECRUITMENT, RE-ENGAGEMENT AND WASTAGE, AND REDUNDANCYRecruitment of men and women to all three Services has remainedgenerally   satisfactory      and, with the exception of several key RAF0-^icer branches and certain other specialist areas, requirements havebeen met.    In the twelve months to 31 March 1978 a total of 39,8000^*&quot;icers, servicemen and servicewomen are expected to be recruitedCompared with 40,244 recruited during the previous year. further details of recruitment for the first nine months of 1977/78 and forsame period in the previous year are given in Annex G Table 5.fitment of officers the number of Royal Navy officers entering from civilianhas been generally satisfactory but there are still shortagesengineer officers and medical officers.   The Royal Marines* once again, recruited the required numbers.thegeC]haveRecruitment of Army officers has continued to improve.then7 applicants are of high quality and this has been reflected in*astaward of 43 undergraduate cadetships and 105 bursaries in thehine months of 1977-   A new company, the Rowallan Company,Deen formed at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to provide^-onal leadership training, prior to formal entry into thea^emy, for those officer applicants for whom the Regularssions Board considers it desirable.   Recruitment of qualified1
doctors remains below target but the entry of medical cadetscontinues to be encouraging.404. There has been a shortage of candidates of adequate gusli^to meet the recruiting requirements for the Royal Air Force. 1*has not proved possible to recruit the numbers required for theGeneral Duties (Pilot, Navigator, Aircraft Control and FighterControl), Engineer, Security (RAF Regiment) and Administrative(Education) Branches, in some cases by a substantial margin. ^eUniversity Cadetship Scheme has attracted only half the expectednumber of recruits to the General Duties, Engineer and Adminisw-Branches.Recruitment of Servicemen405. The recruiting requirements for most branches in the RoJ8^Navy will be met but there will be a shortfall of artificers, 8Darea in which certain categories are already below establishmentapplication rate for Royal Marines other ranks remains buoyantand targets should be achieved.for406. Due to the rundown of the Army, the recruitment targetsoldiers for 1977/78 are lower than in previous years and theprospects for meeting them are good.   The recruitment target1978/79 and future years will be higher to prevent a manpowerdeficit in the early 1980&apos;s.407. The 1977/78 airmen target is very similar to the previoUSexceptye8r&apos;s and there have been no serious recruiting problems,in   some support trades.2
Re-encasement408. Re-engagement rates in all three Services remain satisfactory.VastsRe409. There has been a significant increase in the number of trained officers who have applied for premature voluntary release from the Army in the first six months of 1977/78 and the rate ofexit for soldiers has also been high.   The Royal Air Force is exper-iencing an equally substantial rise   in applications from trainedofficers and men, particularly those with considerable skill and experience.No such increase has been evident in the Royal Navy.Redundancy410. In the Royal Navy the limited programme of officer redundancy,involving a total of 50 Commanders, will have been completed by1 April 1979*    The Army&apos;s redundancy programme will be completed in 1979/80; by 31 December 1977 some 820 officers and 3,500 soldiershad been selected for redundancy, all except 7 officers and 134-aoldiers being volunteers.   Redundancy in the Royal Air Force isdearly complete and in the     three     years up to March 1978 728officers and     1,695 airmen will have left the Royal^ir Force.   The scheme has been predominantly voluntary though 271officers     were made redundant compulsorily.WOMEN1S SERVICES^11.    Members of Queen Alexandra&apos;s Royal Naval Nursing Serviceaod the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) became subject to the3
Naval Discipline Act on 1 July 1977*   The Ministry of Defence isalso continuing the policy of providing wider employment forWRNS personnel and some 4-00 RN shore appointments originallycomplemented for RN officers but which could be filled by WRNSofficers on an opportunity basis hsve been identified.    So far4-3 WRNS officers are filling, or have been nominated for, this type of appointment, and members of the WRNS will thus be emplQyedin more of the senior posts in areas of Management, Intelligence,Communications, Operational support, and St8ff duties. Inof WRNS ratings, alterations to the training, role and structure of the WRNS Regulating category have been made to align it witDthe RN Regulating branch so that a greater degree of integretionin employment can be achieved.   A WRNS Physical Training and* st^Recreation category has been set up and will open in 1978*continues into the opportunities for broadening the scope ofemployment of the Women1 s Royal Army Corps in the Army. Membersof the Women1s Royal Air Force (WRAF) ere employed throughoutRoyal Air Force 8t all levels up to Air Rank.    In May 1977 theDirector of the WRAF was elected chairman of the Committee onWomen in NATO Forces for a two-year term.RESERVES AND CADET FORCES412.     The new arrangements since the lapse of the post of Ad^tb 0*Commanding Royal Naval Reserves are working well.   The strengthe Volunteer Naval Reserves on 31 October   1977 was   ^officers and /&quot;        J ratings.    The strength of the Royal
*reserve was /&quot;    J officers and /&quot;    J men. The TAVR hadnother very successful national publicity campaign in the spring of 1977^hParticular needs of Scotland and Northern Ireland wereecognised by mounting publicity campaigns there in the autumn.The strength of the TAVR on 31 December 1977 was /&quot; JQcluding /&quot; Jwomen, compared with a total strength of*104 on 31 December 1976. The Royal Air Force Regular andVoluntersity Officer Training Corps have again proved valuable.60,eer Reserves strength was     3902     on 31 December 1977* The^erthe past year they have increased in size and have producedofficers for the Regular Army and 162 for the TAVR.^he Cadet Forces continue to play an important role indoping amongst young people between the ages of 12 and 20 the8oOal qualities of self-discipline and leadership and tothea8e an interest in the Armed Forces.    Since 1 January 1978ea Cadet Corps has been reorganised into six areas more closely^Sned to the Royal Navyfs geographical areas in the United^Bdom, permitting each of the area Flag Officers to take a moreect interest in the Corps.    The size of the Army Cadet Trainingxs to be increased to enable them to organise adventureainit*8 for the Cadet Forces.   This will enable the Army Cadetain8 Teams to take over one of the tasks previously carriedD* the Army Youth Teams which are to be disbanded by April 1978e interests of economy in manpower and expenditure.   The Venture5\
Mk 2 self-launching glider has now been introduced into service to augment the gliding facilities for Air Cadets.   This usefuland popular activity continues to play an important part inattracting recruits for the Royal Air Force.PAY AND OTHER CONDITIONS OF service pay and Pensions414. In their Sixth Report (1977), the Review Body on armed forces Pay recommended the payment of a supplement of 5% of totalearnings, subject to a cash minimum of  2.50 and an upper cashmaximum of  4 a week, to all members of the Armed Forces within their terms of reference.   Proportionate rates of supplement wer^recommended for junior servicemen and women.   The Review Body a^s0recommended increases in charges for food and accommodation-These recommendations, which complied with the Government1s gui^anon incomes set out in the White Paper &quot;The Attack on InflationThe Second Year&quot; (Cmnd 6507), were implemented with effect froD11 April 1977.of415. The Armed Forces Pension Scheme provides members the three Services with retirement pensions and terminal grantstogether with a range of death, injury and other benefits whictl* atake account of the special circumstances of a Service career,number of improvements to the Scheme have been introduced myears.    In accordance with Government policy for public sectorschemes it is intended that members of the Scheme should becontracted out of the additional pension element of the new6
earnings related State scheme which comes into operation on6 April 1978 and application has been made to the occupational pensions Board for a contracting-out certificate in accordancewith the provisions of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975-Contracting out will have no effect on current benefits but will permit reduced National Insurance contributions and an extensionia the provision of preserved pensions for early leavers.Reparations are in hand to enable accrued pension rights to betransferred both into and out of the Scheme. gaily WelfareThe Naval Personal and Family Service was formallyinaugurated on 1 April 1977-   Tnis brings together, under the overall control of the Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command, theElating Naval welfare and community services and related aspectsof housing.   In each Area a senior officer in the Command structurewiU be responsible for ensuring the co-ordination of thesedevices.   Sailors and Families Advice Bureaux manned by seniorPatin8s have been opened in all the main Naval ports.   The bureauxpPovide a quick and easy information service for Naval personnelana their families on a wide range of welfare matters and areMoving popular and most successful.^Ice VotingH7.The new arrangements for the registration of Service personneltheir spouses, contained in the Representation of the Peopletne(^ forces) Act 1976, are reflected in the Register of Electors7
coming into force on 16 February 1978.   All Service personnel and their spouses are now able to register as Service voters ona once-and-for-all basis and remain on the register for as longas they remain in the Services.Television in Germany418. More than 20,000 members of the Services and their familieSstationed in Germany are now able to receive recorded transmission of British television programmes and this number will be further increased during 1978.DEFENCE STUDIES, EDUCATION AND TRAININGDefence Studies and Education419. The close relationship between the Ministry of defence the universities in the field of higher defence studies stimnl8analysis and discussion of defence matters.    In 1977 two majorseminars were held under Ministry of Defence sponsorship, one 011Soviet Military Power, Capabilities and Purposes organised bySouthampton University and the other on The Southern Flank errby Oxford University.420. The National Defence College course at Latimer has beenreduced in length and the first new style course began in JaD1978.421. The Royal Navy has 166 university cadets and 64 other ^career officers studying for degrees at civilian universitieS*addition, there are 168 officers reading for a first degree 1118
engineering at the Royal Naval Engineering College Manadon. 135Irving Army officers, six undergraduate cadets and three holdersQf undergraduate bursaries are reading for degrees in engineeringana applied science at the Royal Military College of Science. TheW also has 89 regular officers and 160 undergraduate cadetsbuying at university, together with 153 students who have entered under the undergraduate bursary scheme.   There are also226 RAF university cadets pursuing degree courses while 28ether serving officers are attending postgraduate courses atdiversity.TheWeek course intended to provide selected TAVR officers with abasi^3.The Staff College, Camberley has introduced an annual two^8sic knowledge of staff duties and responsibilities.The study of initial RAF officer training mentioned in the^7 Statement on the Defence Estimates has now been completed.St*ps to implement its proposals will be announced shortly.^Sineerinp; Training*S    The comprehensive study of the structure and training of the* Engineering Branch of the Royal Navy has now been completed. TheCba*ees &quot;nich are being made are designed to ensure that0f^ers and ratings of the Branch are hotter trained and organisedt0 d*al with modern weapon and propulsion systems.9
Flying Training;425. A number of Royal Navy pilots are now training with theRoyal Air Force for Sea Harrier flying duties.   After conversionto the Harrier, they v/ill carry out operational flying trainingon the RN Sea Harriers based at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS)Yeovilton.   The Lynx training squsdron formed at RNAS Yeoviltonin January 1978 and is due to remain there until the early 1980&apos;Swhen it will move to RNAS Portland.    Jetstream aircraft are being converted to replace the Sea Prince for basic flying training forRN helicopter observers from 1979.426. There have been three significant developments in RoyalForce pilot training. The Hawk has been introduced into service for advanced pilot training and tactical weapons training; theJetstream has been re-introduced for advanced pilot trainingrefresher flying on multi-engine aircraft; and a new advancedtraining course using the Wessex has been established for helicopters&quot;copter pilots.   Both the Hawk and Jetstream courses make extentuse of advanced simulators.   The first RAF pilots also beganoperational training on the Sea King helicopter at RNAS Culdroselast November.427. RAF Finningley is now the centre for all navigator, 8irelectronic and 8ir engineer training.   Further progress has bee
11,8 de with the redeployment of training units; the major elements0^ the Central Flying School are now co-located at RAF Leeming andQther elements of the flying training task are being distributed betweenthe       College Cranwell, RAF Linton-on-Ouse andRapAs part of the process of rationalising shore training the**ool of Maritime Operations at HMS Dryad is being further^eloped to accommodate related tasks from other training establish-HMS Daedalus will remain at Lee-on-Solent in modernised^o*modation instead of being transferred to the former RAF airfield at Forney Island.   The latter has been transferred to the Propertyervices Agency for disposal.^9.Steps have been taken to increase the number of junior^ular Army officers with a knowledge of a foreign language. Whenthe ^proposed measures are in full operation, it is expected thatthe nnumber of officers trained to colloquial standardNATO language will increase from 100 to 250 annually.of   them will have been trained in German.LsLininjAll three Services continue to play an active part in thes of developing NATO training.   Examples of internationalio&quot;0b^ration in this field are Lance missile training, naval control
of shipping training and a pilot course for long-rangereconnaissance patrols in the context of land warfare.431. The Governments of the United Kingdom and the federal republic of Germany have agreed in principle that a Tornadotraining establishment responsible for aircrew conversion traini0^should be set up at RAF Cottesmore; confirmation of Italian Parpation is awaited.    Detailed planning is under way and, subject tfinal agreement, training is planned to start with the introducof the Tornado into service.432. The possibility of establishing a tri-national WeaponsConversion Unit for the Tornado in Sardinia has had to be abandonbecause facilities on the required scale could not be provided it is now hoped to establish a bi-national Weapons Conversion ^Dat RAF Honington where British and German aircrew v/ill be taughandle the Tornado as a complete weapons system.433. NATO and other countries also use some of the helicopterpilot training and basic observer flying training provided hyRNAS Culdrose.Commonwealth and Foreign Training434. During 1977 about 7,000 military personnel from manyac in commonwealth and foreign countries attended training course the United Kingdom. In addition, the three Services also Prpersonnel on loan and in training teams to assist with localtraining,
5SUPPORT501.     *pne defence support organisation has undergone manySubstantial changes since the unification of the Ministry of^defence in 1964.   The constant objective has been to cut the costofsupport to the maximum extent possible without damaging theSe*vice to the front-line.c*     Over the years major economies have been made including thePationalisation between the Services of the management of some^ ranges of stores and equipment; the setting up of common orIntegrated services, such as the Defence Lands Organisation andtne Claims Commission; the integration of the Ministry of Defence0*ice and the creation of a unified Defence Communications^twork; the amalgamation of the four Admiralty Supply Departments;rationalisation of the Army&apos;s supply, transport, movement andePair functions; a reduction of the RAF&apos;s organisational structure in the United Kingdom from 8 RAF Commands and 9 Groups to 2 RAFOnan-ds and 4 Groups; new working and management techniques; theof overheads and of manpower; and the use of fewerations and the more economical use of accommodation. Since19?4 Defence Review this latter process has been accelerated.Xample, over 100 sites have been, are being or will be givenrent roles, transferred between Services or given up. About50 othner proposed closures or changes have been announced or areVQrious stages of consultation.1
503.      Opportunities for further economies, especially throughcloser collaboration with our NATO Allies and also throughfurther inter-Service rationalisation in remaining areas, willcontinue to be examined closely.   But we do not expect, afterthe achievements of the last few years,  that there will be agreat deal of scope for large further savings in this field.NATO CO-OPERATION IN LOGISTICS504.     In recent years there has been growing emphasis througnoutthe Alliance on making better use, through collaboration, of nato logistic resources.   The United Kingdom plays its full par^in this area, and attaches high priority to collaboration throws11out the logistic field wherever it is militarily and economica-1-advantageous and consistent with political and industrialconsiderations.    The emphasis given to logistic support in the nato programme of short-term and long-term initiatives set inhand following President Carter&apos;s statement to the North Atlanta0Council in May 1977 is particularly welcome.   The United KingdotDalso attaches importance to the work of the Eurolog Committeeand provides the Chairman for both the Eurolog Steering Commiand its Naval Sub-Group.2
Important areas under consideration in NATO logistics andClvil emergency planning studies include the provision of furtherciviiair and sea transport to enable countries, especially the Unitedates and Canada, to reinforce Europe as quickly as possibleill ar^au emergency.   The United Kingdom has for its part made satis-8ctory arrangements for the use of civil sir and sea transportfopour own forces,and arrangements for the support of-&quot;-can lines of communication through the United Kingdom 8receamg satisfactorily.    Other studies of importance concerna^rangements for the provision   and storage of war reservestocksend, in response to the short-term initiatives, the United506.^om is increasing its holdings of some key items.Achievements in collaborative procurement, standardisation,interoperability of weapons and other equipment should also^mit ^greater collaboration in the field of logistic support.lnK principles for the collaborative support of common equip-^ere agreed by Eurogroup Ministers in 1975 and are nowapplied wnerever possible.   As a result, for example, theA^ Ma-Maintenance Supply Agency (NAMSA) undertakes spares supportne FH70 Field Howitzer and CL89 DRONE for the armies of the kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy, asMl for* the Lance missile and NATO Air Defence Ground Environment&apos; air-defence radars.3
507.   There are many further examples of direct bilateral andmultilateral collaboration between the Allies.    Some currentexamples include:-8^.     a comprehensive overhaul and repair facilityfor marine gas turbine engines at the Royal naval aircraft yard at Fleetlands to service enginesof the Royal Navy and other NATO navies;b.     the provision by the Army of support for theBritish and Belgian armies for tracked combatreconnaissance vehicles,and for the British,Danish and German armies for the Medium GirderBridge.    Similar arrangements covering Swingfiresupport for the British and Belgian armies are under consideration; .     the provision by the Royal Air Force of logistic support for aircraft purchased from the UnitedKingdom by the Norwegian and Belgian air forces and the Royal Netherlands Navy. Co-operativearrangements between the United Kingdom, theFederal Republic of Germany and Italy are already in hand for the support of Tornado when it comes into service.       The two-way support arrangement for Jaguar, between France and United Kingdom,has been enhanced by a direct ADP data link between the French computer at Bordeaux and the
Supply Control Centre at RAF Hendon. Progresscontinues to be made on logistic support arrange-ments with the United States Air Forces in Europefor whom United Kingdom industry is to undertakesome depot-level maintenance of F111 aircraft.Collaborative arrangements with the United states for the support of RAF Phantom and Hercules aircraft are working well.    Important studies are continuingon the development of cross-servicing procedures and techniques so that aircraft of one NATO airforce can be operated and maintained from another1sbases.INTER-SERVICE CO-ORDINATION OF SUPPORT508 tJ-n the continuing search for economies m the support area,e Ministry of Defence has initiated studies into the practicalityOf^king a single Service responsible for the supply of electricalJ-ectronic equipment,and hand tools.This follows the earlierUccessful rationalisation of the supply of air stores, motor8!l8port stores, food and other ranges of materiel in common use.^977 has seen the completion of the main p8rt of the inter-toce Project to enable the next generation of supply computerse*change data and rationalise further the support between the5
three Services. The project will be implemented as the newgeneration of ADP supply systems are introduced between now and the mid-1980s.510. The National Economic Development Organisation (NEDO)report on the use and application of standards in engineering industries (The Warner Report) made favourable comments onstandardisation work within the Ministry of Defence. british standards are adopted whenever possible for procurement purposes,supplemented, when necessary, by a wide range of Defence Standards-The Ministry of Defence has also played an important part in establishing the new NATO Committee of Directors of Standardized00which will encourage wider acceptance of standards and componentspecifications throughout the Alliance.    The first Chairman ofthis Committee is the Ministry of Defence Director ofStandardize511. The Ministry of Defence headquarters staff of the threeMedical Directorates will this year be brought together in onebuilding.   Further progress has also been made with the re-organisation of Service hospitals.   During the past year the RAFhospital at Wroughton was reformed 8s a joint RAF/Army hospitalon the closure of the Military Hospital, Tidworth.    The newQueen Elizabeth Military Hospital at Woolwich has been commiss1and has replaced four other military hospitals and will replacea fifth     later this year.       The Joint Services MedicalRehabilitation Unit at RAF Chessington will also be merged withthe RAF Medical Rehabilitation Unit at RAF Headley Court in 1986
CONFIDENTIALHAF Hospital Cosford was closed at the end of 1977 and studies are continuing into the proposal that either RAF Hospital Elyor RAF Hospital Nocton H8ll should be closed.ROYAL NAVY SUPPORT ORGANISATION512. Satisfactory progress has been made in achieving the staffreductions in the Fleet support organisation that were announced in the 1976 and 1977 Statements on the Defence Estimates. Severalestablishments will have closed by the end of the year. TheRoyal Navy has also decided not to retain the former RAF ThorneyIsland, which has been transferred to the Property ServicesAgency for disposal.gavel Dockyards513. There is more than a full programme of work available forgll the Naval dockyards for the foreseeable future.   For theforthcoming year a number of measures hsve already been taken tobring the load into better balance with available capacity,including some increase in the use of commercial ship repairfacilities.   First priority, however, is being given to improvingdockyard productivity as a means of increasing capacity.514. Work on guided-missile destroyers and larger ships will be concentrated at Portsmouth which also has a full supportingProgramme on patrol submarines and other vessels.   The refittingQnd refuelling of nuclear submarines will remain the major tasksfor Chatham and Rosyth in addition to their supporting programmes0f major and normal refits of frigates, other ships and craft,aQd a steady programme at Rosyth on patrol submarines. DevonportwiU make an increasing contribution to the upkeep of nuclear7
submarines in addition to undertaking the major share of LesnderClass frigate modernisations and other support, including, forexample, the new Type 21 frigates.Vessels515. The new Fleet replenishment ship, RFA Fort Grange, will nowenter service during 1978, replacing RFAs Tarbatness and Ret8Jne .&apos;Another ship of the class, RFA Fort Austin, is under construction and will replace      RFA Resurgent.    The RFAsTidereach and Empire Gull will be withdrawn during 1978.   A newRoyal Maritime Auxiliary Service vessel, RMA.S Throsk, was intro-duced into service in September 1977, replacing two old vessels and providing the principal means of coastal transport for navalarmament stores.Automatic Data Processing516. The increasing use of computers in the Fleet supportorganisation is helping to produce greater economy and efficieIlC^for example, as an aid to workshop production control in the P1?and electrical shops of each of the home dockyards.   Pilot scnewill investigate their possible extension to other dockyarddepartments.   Another ADP project now under way is the directlinking of the Royal Naval Air Stations and the Naval AircraftRepair Organisation with the Royal Air Force&apos;s central computedfor air stores at Hendon.e8
ARMY SUPPORT organisation the measures to be taken for the Army&apos;s logistic^structuring, including the concentration and reduction of store-aiding and repair facilities, are progressing well, and theWorld-wide target reduction of 5,400 civilian staff will be madeby -i .April 1980.    Some 45% of the manpower savings have alreadybeen    , .achieved.    Closures in the past year have included the Royalectrical and Mechanical Engineers workshops at Killingworth ina&amp;d Wear and at Coypool near Plymouth,and the regional***Uct^ance depot at York.    There has also been a substantial!on in staff at the regional depot in Hereford.    The Army^xstic Executive formally came into existence in April 1977,8lia i+c*u8 major elements have been established at Andover as theQf an integrated logistic command and control organisation.^uBust 1977 the decision was announced to close the Central8nce Depot, Chilwell as part of the reorganisation of theCentra-, rv.Ordnance Depots.    Stores held at Chilwell will be trsns-in t0 Donnington 8nd Bicester and substantial financial savingcom*o ^0wer and overheads are expected when the reorganisation is-The re-location of Army Manning and Records Offices andCental Pay Offices will progress significantly in 1978 soat aboout 60% 0f the relocation programme will have been achievede end of the year.ne Army has also been conducting a thorough study of its0Qation requirements.   This involves taking account of^e^9
certain contingencies and the distribution of units throughoutthe country, and reviewing all its assets including those taken over from or planned to be taken over from the Royal Air Force.This offers opportunities to make use of better and neweraccommodation and to contribute to the forecast release of asubstantial amount of property in 1978.    Subject to the outcome of consultations with other interests involved, the surplus will-include: Hopton Barracks, Devizes; Norton Manor Camp, Taunton;Chaucer Barracks, Canterbury; Haig Lines, Church Crookham; RoyalVictoria Hospital, Netley; the Roy8l Armoured Corps Manning and records Office, Whetstone; and Sherford Camp, Taunton.    In sddit1a number of miscellaneous, small properties will be put up for disposal.ROYAL AIR FORCE SUPPORT ORGANISATIONEconomy in Support Costs520. The merger of Support and Training Commands was complete0&apos;in June 1977 resulting in the closure of RAF Andover.   The newintegrated organisation, known as RAF Support Command, h8S its headquarters at RAF Brampton.521. Proposals for the rationalisation of ground radio engining tasks are still being considered.    Support Command Signal3Headquarters and the Radio Introduction Unit moved to RAF Bensoin March 1977, enabling RAF Medmenham to be transferred for uby the Ministry of Defence Police Training School.
522. The transfer of engineering tasks from the MaintenanceUnits (MUs) at Aldergrove and Sydenham is proceeding as planned and should be complete by 351 March 1978.   These transfers, togetherwith those reported in last yearfs Statement on the Defence Estimates,will concentrate repair resources at the remaining MUs. Inparticular this will allow the centralisation of previously dispensedfacilities for equipment repair at No 30 MU/RAF Sealand for avionicsand at RAF St than for engines of fixed-wing aircraft and fornechanical components, thus further strengthening in-Servicesupport for front-line aircraft.523. Further improvements have been made in the use of computersto control the supply of expensive assets.   The system for thecontrol of aero-engine supply has been expanded to include allnodular engines for which the Roy8l Air Force are responsible, andthe RAF Supply Control Centre has developed techniques to improveforecasting of spares requirements for Tornado, Nirarod and Hawkaircraft.   A Density Activity Complex was formally opened at No 16IU RAF Stafford on 6 April 1977*    In this complex advanced materialstorage and handling techniques have greatly enhanced the speed and cost-effectiveness of supply.   The complex absorbed a largeproportion of the stock from No 25 MLT RAF Hartlebury allowing thatunit to be closed in September 1977-524. HQ Provost and Security Services (UK) and two subordinateunits were amalgamted 8nd relocated at RAF Rudloe Manor.525. The Officers1 and Aircrew Selection Centre at RAF BigginBill will move to RAF Bentley Priory in 1981, and most of the land8nd buildings still held by the Royal Air Force at Biggin Hill11CONFIDENTIAL
will be sold.   A small enclave, including the Battle of BritainMemorial Chapel 8nd the Officers1 Mess which will accommodate the RAF Chaplains1 School transferred from Amport House, Andoverwill, however, be retained.    This will preserve a link betweenthe Royal Air Force 8nd Biggin Hill which has played such a prominent role in RAF history.LANDS526. The Ministry of Defence has continued to reduce its holdings of land in keeping with its established policy of disposing of a^property for which there is no foreseeable defence requirement.The area of land held on leasehold and freehold was reduced by 8further 4,500 acres in the year ended   30 September 1977, makinga total of 33,400 acres over the five years up to that date,and the process of contraction and redeployment resulting fromthe Defence Review will enable the release of more land in 197^*527. With one exception, all the recommendations in the reportof the non-statutory inquiry conducted in 1975/76 by BaronessSharp into the continued use of Dartmoor for military traininghave been accepted in principle and are receiving detailed consideration.528. Continuing attention is given to the need for conservati00on defence lands.   Nesrly 100 Service conservation groups havebeen formed and valuable links with external organisations enC*societies are maintained.
LIVING ACCOMMODATIONSingle 8nd married quarters in the United Kingdom and0Ver3ees are continuously improved to bring them up to moderns^andards although in certain areas, such as Northern Ireland and&quot;LZei operational considerations constrain the standards that811 be achieved.   Progress is also necessarily affected by widerUl*8etary considerations, and has been slower in the last yearoriginally planned.    It is proposed to begin an extendedpr*08famme of thermal insulation of married quarters, including the^ling of wall cavities where appropriate.The hire of married quarters for all three Services willC08t about  43 million in 1978/79.    Most of the expenditure is^red in West Germany where an increase of about 1,000 hiringsforeseen although the number of hirings worldwide is expectedto &quot;kDe about the same as in 1977/78.531.The number of married quarters in the United Kingdom continuesto hededuced in step with the fall in demand that has been a^a of recent years.   This trend is producing an unavoidable1sturbing level of vacant married quarters.   To keep this level^0 the minimum, quarters are passed to the Property Services Agency^aposal as soon as it is clear that there is no long-term need0r* thnem-   In the year ended   31 October 1977 some 1,600 quarterseclared surplus to requirements.   V/here it is essential to^tainvacant quarters for any significant period against future^9*uipements, temporary uses are sought including leasing agreements^al housing authorities.
WORKS532. About h8lf the works budget is spent on new construction,and priority is given to work required to permit the introductionof new weapons systems and other operational requirements,reorganisation and high priority training.    Thus the majorfeatures of the programme will consist of the continued modernisttion of naval bases and training establishments; the Army&apos;srestructuring and continuous improvement of the Army&apos;s estate;the introduction of the Tornado aircraft; and the rationalisation of the R&amp;D establishments.   The remainder of the works budget is spent on maintenance including some large projects such asairfield pavement resurfacing.533. Next year an additional  8 million will be spent as part government&apos;s measures to assist the construction industry. Thiswill be spent mainly on further projects to improve the Army^s living and working accommodation; projects affectingoperational requirements and safety measures; measures designedto conserve energy; 8nd a large number of relatively small but important jobs to improve the condition of the defence estate.ENERGY CONSERVATION534.   Energy consumption during 1976/77 has continued to be closely monitored and savings of approximately 10%     over consultion of the early 1970&apos;s     have been achieved for the third Je&amp;c
in succession.   At one Royal Ordnance Factory substantial progressnas been made towards a target saving of 25% in steam-raising bymodifying control systems and other means.   One R&amp;D establishmenthas been able to reduce its fuel bill by some 30% by changing the type of fuel burnt and three Ordnance Depots in BAOR have between themsaved nearly two million litres of furnace fuel oil in the last yearby a combination of good housekeeping, technical improvements and better use of buildings.The Roy8l Air Force has replaced thebeating systems in three hangars at a major operational unit andthis should reduce operating costs by 60% enabling the capital cost to be recovered in less than two years.MOVEMENTS535.   The Royal Fleet Auxiliary logistic landing ships and overseasstore carriers fill a major role in meeting the freighting require-fients to and from our Service establishments abroad, including the initial stages of the important task of running down the Maltabase.   In addition they have been engaged in the movements tasksassociated with military exercises.   A logistic landing ship is^ue to start a regular schedule every 4-5 days between MarchwoodRilitary port and continental Europe in esrly 1978 and this will-^&quot;ther improve military container distribution.
536.    Simplified and more economical procedures for the movementof RAF air and surface cargo were introduced during the year,providing substantial cost savings.537*   Fluctuations in force levels in Northern Ireland and the reinforcement of Belize during 1977 have made additional callson movement resources but without detriment to the overallscheduled movement of passengers and cargo by air.METEOROLOGY538.   Although the Royal Air Force, Civil Aviation 8nd the genera1public remain their principal customers, the meteorological office&apos;s services have been expanding in several other areasnotably in support of agriculture and the off-shore oil industry-Special procedures have also been developed to support the routi0operations by Concorde aircraft.   The revenue earned by the meteorological Offioe from all sources now amounts to about onethird of the total expenditure.539*   Two ocean weather ships have been extensively refittedto enable the United Kingdom to maintain observations at one4- Nortkstation in the reduced four-station network of the present *&apos;Atlantic Ocean Station scheme.540.   The further development of the satellite-receiving stati0f ^at Lasham has continued in collaboration with the Royal Airc?8, u8hLeEstablishment at Farnborough.   The station is providing a vaservice for both forecasting and research in the form of d8 8
from existing meteorological satellites, snd will be able toreceive data from future satellites including the Europeanmeteorological satellite METEOSAT.541. Research activity designed to support all theservices provided by the Meteorological Office, has continuedcovering a large number of subjects and in particular special attention has been given to questions affecting aircraft safety, such as windshears at low levels and the icing of helicopters.OTHER SUPPORTManagement Review542. Many of the major recommendations of the Management Reviewof the Ministry of Defence headquarters have now been implementedincluding the proposed reduction in the number of AccountingOfficers from six to two and the closer integration of severalProcurement Executive functions with those of the rest of theMinistry.543. It has been decided not to proceed with the proposal,announced in last year&apos;s Statement on the Defence Estimates, thatthe post of Chief of Personnel and Logistics should lapse. TheChief of Personnel and Logistics will, instead, assume certainresponsibilities previously discharged by the Vice Chief of DefenceStaff.   The post will be re-titled Vice Chief of Defence Staff(Personnel and Logistics), and will carry membership of the defence council.   The post of Vice Chief of Defence Staff will lapse,ijsnpower Savings5H.    The number of Ministry of Defence civilians for whom provision has been made in the Defence Estimates is 269,500 on 1 April 1978 and264,000 on 31 March 1979.    In addition some 23,500 are employed in the^oyal Ordnance Factories; their costs are met from the Trading Fund. In17CONFIDENTIAL
the period 1964 to 1974 civilian strengths were reduced by 114,000 011broadly comparable basis. By April 1979 the number of civilians *0f fin the Ministry of Defence, including Property Services Agency sworking on behalf of the Ministry, is expected to show a reducti011of 40,000 on 1974 strengths after allowance for organisationalchanges which have taken place meanwhile.    During 1978/79 numbers are expected to fall by   5,500,   including headquarters staffs.This is the final st8ge in the achievement of the reduced civile011manpower targets set as part of the 1974 Defence Review and the subsequent expenditure reviews in 1975 and 1976.   The rundownhave been carried through with the minimum of compulsory redun545. The combined Service and civilian reductions in headgnsrstaff arising out of the Management and expenditure reviews shouresult in savings approaching 9 to 10% of 1974 headquarters n^beApril 1979-The intention is to find still further economies byearly 1980&apos;s, including savings in senior posts.Apprentice training546. The Ministry of Defence continues to train significantnumbers of civilian apprentices.   The entry for 1977 was about,000 and there are now some 7,500 young men in training.Ministry thus has roughly one apprentice for every five creicompared with the ratio of one to nine in industry generally&apos;Nevertheless the problem of recruiting skilled men continues?a reflection of the general shortage of skilled men.   The M1therefore intends to expand the apprentices entry in the comin^year.
 jgpersal5^7.    Forward planning to meet the Ministry&apos;s commitments under government-s dispersal programme is going ahead.   The programmeEvolves the dispersal of some 4,250 Ministry of Defence posts to^rdiff by 1983/84 and up to 5,500 to two locations in Glasgow,1.500 posts by 1985/84 and the remainder by 1985/86 - 1987/88.the dispersals, the bulk of the Ministry&apos;s procurement policy**k will be concentrated in the west of England and south Wales,vhUe Glasgow will become another major administrative centre.
