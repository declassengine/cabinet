COPY NO.      /CABINETFARM prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have much sympathy with the general principles underlying the proposals in C.(58) 98.   I am however perturbed by the amount of&quot;new money&quot; which is involved, and by the uncertainty which mustsurround all the figures generally.   I therefore wonder whether it wouldnot be wiser to start the scheme on a rather more modest scale, bymeans of some reduction of the upper limits of eligibility, so that wecan feel our way more cautiously.   My reasons are as follows:-(a) A fresh burden on the Exchequer of some  5 millions a year of new money is something quite new in our thinking since we consideredthe idea at the time of the Price Review.   I do not believe that we couldbe sure of getting any credit, even indirectly, in future Reviews for this sum;  and it is not certain whether we can be sure of getting fully effective credit for the cost of the actual schemes as suggested inparagraph 5.   And there is the cost of extra staff involved, approximately 130,000, which is also new money.(b) The total amount of money which would be expended as a resultof these schemes could amount to some   ISmillions a year, at least forthree years, and to a somewhat smaller but still significant amount fora number of years after that.   In all, this is a considerable diversion ofmoney from larger to small scale farming.   This can only be justifiedeconomically if the economic efficiency of the small farms concernedcan be radically improved.(c) The merit of the scheme will be the Sxtent to which it enablesus to reduce the total value of the guarantees across the board to allfarmers by more than we should otherwise have been able to do at futureReviews, at the cost of paying rather more to a proportion of them.   Thiscost ought to be kept as low as possible, until we can see if we really are getting value for our money.(d) The number of possible applicants given in paragraph 3 suggeststo me that in the early days the administrative burden could quite easilyprove to be insupportable.   It is essential that a scheme of this sort shouldnot break down for such a reason.   I find it very hard to believe thatthe Advisory Services could actually deal with as many as 30,000comprehensive plans in a year, and even more difficult to believe thatthey could also weed out the extra 60,000 potential applicants under thesmall farmer scheme before they got down to business.   The new farm improvement scheme is itself throwing I understand quite a heavyadministrative burden on the Ministry of Agriculture.-1 -C.(58) 10010th May, 1958(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
(e)       There are a great many loopholes for unsatisfactory accountingin the scheme, which are perhaps inevitable on seme scale if theadministrative machine is not to be clogged up with detail.   But the morewe take on in a short time the more haphazard will be the control andthe more we shall have to rely on the judgment of officials working underexcessive pressure.   Even if their judgments are right the possibilityof their being disputed by applicants could lead to still further difficulty.2. For these reasons I consider that these schemes should be started on a more modest scale by way of reduction in the eligibilitytests to the point where the total numbers to be dealt with are not130,000 but perhaps 90,000.   This should be done by reducing, at least for the time being, the man-days criterion and modifying the acreagelimitations.   It is much easier to relax later than to:tighten up once weare committed to the scheme.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.9th May, 1958
