w Annex IRIGHTS OF THE TURKISH CYPRIOT COMMUNITYThis has already been studied in a preliminary way.

(g) Access to the court of law.(h) Arrangements covering laws affecting Turkish-Cypriot affairs.(f) Arrangements for seeking redress in cases of alleged discrimination.APPENDIX BCOMMENTARY1.  There are three important points not covered by the draft treaty at appendix A.(a) International guarantees and supervision of the settlement. The essentialinternational instrument guaranteeing the proposed settlement would bethe tripartite treaty itself. It is for consideration whether as an additionalsafeguard it would be desirable or possible to persuade the United StatesGovernment (and perhaps other NATO Governments as well) to underwrite the treaty in the way that the British and american governments were asked to underwrite the Franco-German Saarsettlement of 1954. Even so, the problem would remain (as with allinternational treaties) of what sanctions could be employed if one partybroke, or was alleged to have broken, any of its provisions. What is really required is some kind of Court of Appeal. A neutral highcommissioner could fulfil this role if it was agreed in advance that his decision would be binding. Alternatively there could be provision inthe treaty for disputes to be referred either to the NATO Council (this,of course, would involve securing the consent of all members of NATOin advance; the recent settlement of the Anglo-German support costsdispute might not be a bad precedent), or to the International Court atthe Hague. Whatever form the Court of Appeal took, it would no doubt have to be empowered to deal with any complaint arising out of thetreaty; but Turkish complaints about Greek treatment of TurkishCypriots would inevitably predominate, and it might perhaps be possibleto establish some kind of International Tribunal of Guarantees in the island to deal specifically and in the first instance with such minoritydisputes.(b) External defence. In C. (57) 184 it was stressed that the problem of the *external defence of Cyprus can only be solved adequately by theretention of full British sovereignty over the whole Island. Under anyother circumstances the question is to seek the least unsatisfactorysolution.The external defence of Cyprus is almost wholly a question of air... defence in both global and limited war. There may be a requirement inTor,defence against small raiding parties or saboteurs.   The british   enclaves would contain almost all the military facilities necessary to the&quot;defence of the Island.   This alone is a strong argument for seekingagreement that the United Kingdom should be given this responsibility.Furthermore, this arrangement would avoid possible friction between
Greek and Turkish interests and would have the added advantage thatthe Cypriot population might accept the presence of British troops more readily if they knew them to be wholly responsible for external defence.Finally this is the arrangement which most nearly allows full freedom toact in support of NATO, the Bagdad Pact or other British interests.It is for consideration whether Cyprus should be included in the nato area. If defence were to become a NATO responsibility therewould be the following disadvantages:  (i) The   arrangement   would   not   necessarily   provide   for   therequirements of Bagdad Pact support, nor for any of the possiblecircumstances in which British and NATO interests were notidentical.(ii) This could not but reduce our influence in the Bagdad Pact.(iii) It might also lead to undesirable pressures arising within NATOitself.(c) Reversion to Turkey of the United Kingdom enclaves in the event of ourleaving the Island completely. The inclusion in the draft treaty of a clause to this effect would greatly increase the difficulty of securingGreek agreement. It is for consideration whether the Turkish reversiontitle would not best be embodied in a separate Anglo-Turkish agreement(perhaps an Exchange of Letters); ideally, if the Turks would agree,this separate part of the settlement might be embodied in aMemorandum of Understanding which would be kept secret. On theother hand the Turks might for prestige reasons insist on an openagreement.2.   Notes on individual paragraphs of the draft treaty (a) Timing (Articles I, IV and V). It is provided in Articles I and IV that within six months of the signature of the Agreement a plebiscite wouldbe held, and under Article V that the Island should be ceded within three months from the date of the plebiscite if there, was a majority atthe plebiscite in favour of this. The Governor will need to be askedwhether either of these limits would leave enough time for what needs to be done. It is possible that six months may not be long enoughbefore the plebiscite. Field-Marshal Lord Harding estimated a yearago, while Governor of Cyprus, that it would take nine months fromthe date of publication of a law empowering the Cyprus Governmentto prepare electoral rolls before their preparation could be completed and elections actually held. A period of months was allowed in therecent British Togoland plebiscite.(b) British sovereign enclaves (Article II) (i) There are many.variants of this proposal. Annex A contemplatesonly one, under which, the United Kingdom and Turkeyseparately retain sovereignty of their enclaves. This would ofcourse involve our retaining responsibility for the administrationof a considerable Cypriot population.(ii) In view of British defence commitments outside the Island we havenot considered any arrangement under which responsibility for theenclaves in the south-east of the Island would be shared betweenthe United Kingdom and Turkey. Such a variant involves all,the difficulties of a condominium, in particular the problem ofgovernment of the shared area in the event of disagreement between the co-domini. Furthermore independent Turkishaction from the shared area could be very embarrassing to theUnited Kingdom.(iii) A variant under which the Turks would have control of the wholeof the south-east of the Island except for the British installations in the area, might appear to the Greeks to be indistinguishablefrom full scale partition, and as such would be whollyunacceptable to them. By the same token it would be the most acceptable of the three variants to the Turks; and it would relieveus of the responsibility for the administration of local inhabitants.
(iv) The British enclave in the south-east is virtually the proposal tomerge the Ayios Nikolaos and Dhekelia enclaves into one area which was rejected in C. (57) 265. The addition of Famagustawould be likely greatly to increase the objections which were thenput forward on the score of difficulty with the local inhabitants.(c) Turkish enclave (Article III). The area of the Turkish enclave is large enough to house the Turkish garrison provided that access to outsidelogistic requirements is available.The civil population of the proposed enclave would be about,000 Greeks and 300 Turks. It is for consideration whether this area is anything like large enough to satisfy Turkish aspirations. If the area was extended westwards as far as (but not including) the main roadrunning south from Lefkoniko to Kondea, the Greek population wouldbe about 10,500 and the Turkish population 800.The cession of the Turkish enclave to Turkey would have to takeplace at least a few minutes before the cession of the rest of the island to Greece; otherwise we should have already lost our title to cede.But this would not, of course, mean that there would be any significantperiod of time during which the Turks would have their enclave while we remained responsible for the rest of the island. In practice theperiod of overlap would probably be something between one and forty-eight hours.(d) Turkish and Greek forces (Articles HI and VI)(i) Any Turkish forces, while large enough to guarantee the securityof the Turkish enclave, should not be of such a size as to constitute a serious threat to the Greek part of Cyprus. Theinclusion of artillery and armoured units would appear such a threat and could not be justified by any legitimate Turkishstrategic requirements in Cyprus. It would also be strategicallyundesirable to allow the Turks to deploy such teeth arms in cyprus where they would be less immediately available for thesupport of NATO and the Bagdad Pact. Similar objectionsapply to the inclusion of naval and air force units, facilities forthe deployment of which do not in any case exist within theTurkish enclave.(ji) Against the assumption of a settled political situation under british sovereignty, the long-term order of battle approved by the Chiefsof Staff provided for three battalions to meet internal security requirements in Cyprus. We assume that the proposed agreement would result in a settled situation and a similar requirement. the greeks, if they were to control the major part of the island, wouldrequire this force; the Turkish force of equivalent size, shown in annex F, would balance the Greek internal security force andallay Turkish fears. The same objections as are given above tothe inclusion of artillery and armour and naval and air force units in the Turkish forces would apply to those of the Greeks.(iii) The essential reason for limiting Greek armed strength in the islandis to counter the Turkish argument that Greek control of Cypruswould constitute a military menace to the Turkish mainland.There is no reason to think that the Greeks would in fact objectto this. They have no reason to want to turn Cyprus into a major military base, and during the Foreign Secretary&apos;s visit to athens in February 1958 the last Greek Government made clearthat they would not object to restrictions on their rights ofmilitarisation.(e) Arrangements for plebiscite (Article IV). It would be necessary, priorto holding the plebiscite, to draw up new electoral rolls. The onlyelectoral rolls at present in being are those covering registration of votersfor municipal elections. It would be necessary to extend the coverageof the electoral roll to the whole Island, to bring it up-to-date, andto ensure that the electoral roll will cover all persons who it may bedecided should be entitled to vote in such a plebiscite.
Decisions will particularly be necessary as to whether the voteshould be granted to all adults over twenty-one, and not merely males,as is the case in municipal elections; as to whether the other chiefqualifications for the vote should be residence in Cyprus and Britishcitizenship. There will doubtless be claims and counter-claims by Greece &quot;and Turkey that Cypriots overseas should also be entitled to vote; thiswould be cumbrous, but since the claims of Greece and Turkey would tend to cancel each other out, it will probably suffice to provide thatit would be necessary to be resident in Cyprus on the date of signature of the Agreement in order to acquire a vote. If it has not been possibleto terminate the state of Emergency in Cyprus before the signature of theAgreement, the effect of confining the vote to persons resident in Cypruson the day of the Agreement will be to deprive exiled persons such asArchbishop Makarios of the right to vote.The plebiscite most recently undertaken by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment was that in the United Nations Trust Territory of Togolandadministered by Great Britain. The plebiscite there was undertakenunder United Nations supervision. There might be claims by cyprus and by Greece that the Cyprus plebiscite should be undertaken under either joint Greek-Turkish or United Nations auspices, and it will need to be decided whether such claims should be resisted.The draft restricts the plebiscite to only two alternatives: Enosisor its rejection. This is in fact a concession to the opponents of Enosiswhose vote will thus not be divided between the various other possibilitiese.g., independence, partition, union with Turkey, status quo ortridominium. It is a concession which the supporters of Enosis could wellafford to make, since they are virtually certain to win the plebiscitewhatever happens. In any case, a plebiscite with more than two alternatives would be considerably less easy to administer, and theoreticalproblems could arise about the possibility of no one solution commandingan absolute majority.(/) Rejection of Enosis at the plebiscite (Article V (2)). The effect of thisclause is that if Enosis is voted down in the plebiscite, no solution ofthe Cyprus problem will have been achieved and we shall be back in animpasse scarcely more promising than the present one. But there isin fact so very little chance of Enosis obtaining anything but a sweepingmajority that it has not been thought necessary to make any moreelaborate provision (e.g., for a second plebiscite on some other solutionor solutions) against the eventuality of Enosis failing at the polls.
