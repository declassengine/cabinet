secret this DOCUMENT LS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1958C. (58) 53 Copy No.27th February, 1958CABINETWAGES policy note by the Prime MinisterAt their meeting on 3rd December, 1957, the Cabinet invited me to arrangefor officials to examine the major issues of wages policy which had emerged duringthe discussion (C.C. (57) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 3).2. I now circulate a Report on this subject which has been prepared by a group of officials, under the chairmanship of Sir Roger Makins. It is necessarilylong, because the subject matter is complex. The group have therefore prepared a summary of their Report which I circulate as a covering note. This sets out themain points which arise on the Report and makes certain comments on them forthe consider at&apos;m of the Cabinet.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,26th February, 1958.
OBSERVATIONS BY OFFICIALS ON THE ATTACKED REPORT on wages AND RELATED matters the attached Report considers the implications of the Government^ objective of stability in the value of the pound, and examines various possible policies on wages, prices and related matters which might help secure that objective.Stability in the Value of the Pound2. Stability in the value of the pound (that is general stability in the price level) does not mean that each and every price should be stable. Some will go up: and others should go down (paragraph 2).3. The Report is concerned primarily with internal prices and the internalvalue of the pound: but the internal and the external value of the pound are infact inseparable. The price level in the United Kingdom cannot be insulated toany great extent from the trend of prices abroad: in particular the price ofimports which constitute between one-fifth and one-sixth of the price cf finaloutput is beyond the control of the United Kingdom. This involves difficulties for any policy of price stabilisation at home, but does not destroy its feasibility orlessen its desirability (paragraph 7).Wages and Salaries4. The table in paragraph 4 of the Report shows that almost half of theprice of total final output consists of wages and salaries. If the rate of increasein these can be kept broadly in step with the rate of increase in the volume of output, other elements in price (apart from imports) should not present great difficulties. Thus wage increases are the primary problem. The rate of increasein basic wages and salaries which, on the basis of post-war experience, might be compatible with price stability is about 2 per cent, per annum, taking one year with another (paragraphs 6, 23 (i) and Annex I).Possible Wage PoliciesCentralised or State Systems of Wage Settlements5. A description of the centralised or State systems in various foreigncountries is given in Appendix II. Adoption of any of these systems in the UnitedKingdom would involve a revolutionary break with tradition. Irrespective of their merits, we do not think that such changes are feasible in present circumstances(paragraphs 18-21).Existing Systems and Policies6. Our existing system of voluntary collective bargaining is deeply rootedin history: it has merits, notably its strike record in post-war years. But it hasbeen associated with persistent price rises in these years. Before 1939, collective bargaining did not usually endanger the price level because unemployment was much higher than it is now, but we do not think that any Government would wishto push deflation so far. We are very doubtful whether the present system even with more intense educational efforts through the Cohen Council and in otherways will in itself secure stable prices, especially when expansion is resumed(paragraphs 9-17).Middle Courses7. Middle courses, involving various degrees of change from existing policies,are:  (i) The declaration of a rate of increase in basic wages which is likely to be broadly consistent with price stability say 2 per cent, per &quot;annum(paragraph 23 (iv)) or a rate of increase related to the cost-of-living(paragraphs 29 and 30). This would not have any legal sanction but would be only a guiding light for all concerned in wages matters andthe public generally.

Irrespective of their merits, we do not think that such changes are feasible in present circumstances(paragraphs 18-21).Existing Systems and Policies6.

But it hasbeen associated with persistent price rises in these years. Before 1939, collective bargaining did not usually endanger the price level because unemployment was much higher than it is now, but we do not think that any Government would wishto push deflation so far. We are very doubtful whether the present system even with more intense educational efforts through the Cohen Council and in otherways will in itself secure stable prices, especially when expansion is resumed(paragraphs 9-17).Middle Courses7. Middle courses, involving various degrees of change from existing policies,are:  (i) The declaration of a rate of increase in basic wages which is likely to be broadly consistent with price stability say 2 per cent, per &quot;annum(paragraph 23 (iv)) or a rate of increase related to the cost-of-living(paragraphs 29 and 30). This would not have any legal sanction but would be only a guiding light for all concerned in wages matters andthe public generally.53075B
(ii) The establishment of a declared rate as in (i) above, as an agreed normwhich all workers might reasonably expect to get, and which shouldbe refused or increased only on approval by an independent arbitralbody (paragraphs 23 (v) and 29).(iii) Long-term contracts providing for regular increments in basic wages(paragraph 24).8. It does not appear to us that any change in wages policy could have mucheffect on the present wage round. But the problem is a continuing one and decisions must soon be taken about the Government attitude to the next roundwhich can be expected to begin in the autumn.9. An attempt to establish an agreed norm for wage rate increases(paragraph 23 (v)) would involve a very high degree of co-operation from the tradeunions and the employers: it would also require a fundamental revision of thearrangements for arbitration (paragraphs 58-68) for which legislation would be needed.   We doubt whether such changes are feasible in present circumstances.Long-term contracts with fixed annual increments have some attractions: butthey would have to be made industry by industry and have to be widespread before they could materially affect the situation, and they would then give rise to manyof the difficulties of establishing an agreed norm (paragraphs 24-26).10. We think that there would be considerable advantages in the provisionof a guiding light as in 7 (i) above. Hitherto the advice given lias been somewhatnegative and imprecise, and this has impaired its effectiveness. A clear lead could hardly fail to affect the claims put forward by the unions and the attitude ofemployers, wages boards and arbitrators. The guiding statement could be to theeffect that there were good prospects for price stability provided that, among other things, increases in basic wages and salaries did not exceed x per cent, per annumtaking one year with another. On present showing the rate might be 2 per cent.,but it would clearly need to be discussed with employers&apos; representatives and unions: and would need to be reconsidered from time to time. If settlements inthe present wage round come out at or below cost-of-living increases, this wouldprovide a suitable lead-in to the proposal. But in principle it would be sounderand more consistent with the objective of price stability if the figure for the futurewas related to increases in national productivity.11. The suggestion in paragraph 10 above does not imply that the existingpattern of basic wages (and, still less, of earnings) should be frozen: for this wouldresult in social injustice and economic damage. The treatment of this problem of wage differentials would, under the guiding light proposal, have to be rather looserthan under the proposal for an established and agreed norm (paragraphs 23 (v)and 58-68). Every effort would have to be made, however, to persuade allconcerned that increases in basic wages beyond the guiding light should be grantedonly in exceptional circumstances and on grounds clearly not applicable to other large sections of the community. This would leave room for changes of statuswhere for one reason or another the basic wages of any particular group of workers had become out of line. As far as earnings (as opposed to basic wages) areconcerned, there would continue to be flexibility through overtime, incentivebonuses, and similar supplements.Pay in the Public Sector12. If the Government agreed, as suggested in paragraph 10 above, on theprovision of a guiding light about tolerable rates of wage increases, it would haveto do all in its power to see that this was observed in areas under its control orinfluence (paragraph 23 (vii)).13. In the case of the Civil Service, the Government&apos;s control over wages is complete (subject to the provision for arbitration), and the main problem is created by its acceptance of the priuciple of &quot; fair comparison &quot; with comparable outsideoccupations. If other employers generally observed the guiding light, there wouldbe no difficulty here: but, if they did not and the Government none the less insisted on its observation in regard to the Civil Service, complaints about breach of faithwould arise (paragraph 38).
In other public services, there is no generally accepted principle for thesettlement of pay claims, and the problem of following the guiding light (if it isobserved by employers generally) is mainly one of control. In the case of theNational Health Service and local services such as Police and Education, ministers might wish to consider securing effective Government control at the negotiatingstage and thus ensuring that the guiding light is observed. Ministers have no powerof control over the pay of the general Local Authority grades, and this should bemade clear. The Fire Service (where the Exchequer contribution is only 25 percent.) might best be treated in the same way as the general Local Authority grades,and this means divesting the Home Secretary of his power to approve settlements.Local Authorities can no doubt be expected to.observe the guiding light wherecontrol is in their hands (paragraphs 41 and 42).Nationalised Bodies14. The position in regard to nationalised bodies could be embarrassing. Ifthey for any reason ignored the guiding light, it would be assumed that ministers were responsible. The Government could no doubt informally encourage these bodies to observe the guiding light in arriving at wage settlements and to resistclaims which went beyond that, at least up to the point of arbitration. Subject tothis, it would be better if the bodies could be seen to be left substantially to managetheir wage affairs, since overt interference is likely to provoke opposition and sofrustrate the Governments objective (paragraph 32).Wages Councils, Arbitration and Conciliation15. In paragraphs 43 to 68 we describe the existing system and the amendments which would be needed under the various proposals in paragraph above. The Minister of Labour is already consulting industry about the questionof continuing compulsory arbitration, at present provided for under the industrial disputes Order (paragraph 53).If the Government decided in favour of a guiding light, no changes would be needed in the machinery of wages boards and arbitration (paragraph 56). This,however, might need to be reconsidered if wage-fixing bodies, operating under government aegis, made awards which ignored the guiding light. The positionof the Chief Industrial Commissioner at the Ministry of Labour would be delicate,since he could not effectively mediate in cases where an ignoring of the guidinglight was contemplated (paragraph 68).Profits, Dividends and Prices16. We consider various suggestions for controlling or limiting profits(paragraphs 70-75), dividends (paragraphs 95-102), capital gains (paragraphs103-104), and prices (paragraphs 76-94). The trade unions would not be preparedto make a substantial sacrifice of their bargaining power without correspondingassurances in these fields. If, however, the proposed change was confined to the setting up of a guiding light, the accompanying adjustments might be modest, as described in the following paragraphs.Profits17. There are strong economic objections to any attempt to control profits(paragraphs 71-73). We recommend, however, that fresh efforts should be madeby Ministers, the Cohen Council, and companies themselves, to create a betterpublic understanding of the role of profits in the economic system, their importance for investment, and their relative smallness after depreciation and taxation(paragraph 74).Dividends18. There are no worthwhile economic arguments in favour of restraint of dividends and some objections to it (paragraphs 95-101). Some form of control,however, over dividends would be economically less damaging than attempts tocontrol profits as such. It might be helpful in securing trade union co-operation ifaggregate dividends were seen not to be increasing at a greater rate than wages. Thepossibilities of informal arrangements to secure this might be discussed with employers&apos; associations (paragraph 102).
Prices19. Price control of even a limited range of necessities would involve a degreeof regimentation of manufacture which would hardly be tolerated in peacetime and.would have disastrous repercussions on our export trade. It would also require legislation.  We do not recommend it (paragraphs 82-86).20. The Government would be under pressure to prevent prices in the nationalised industries from rising. As productivity in most of them rises at lessthan the average rate for the country, this would have to be resisted from thebeginning. Even under a successful wages policy, prices in the nationalised industries are likely to have to rise at little less than the rate of increase in wages.This is, however, not disastrous for general price stability, because on average thecost of fuel, power and transport forms only a small part of the value of manufactured output and of the cost of living (paragraphs 78-81).21. If there is restraint in wages in accordance with the guiding light, theGovernment might not only exhort traders to lower prices, but might also seek theco-operation of the industrial associations in a campaign for lower prices in manysectors (paragraph 87).Retail Price Index22. Circumstances (lower import prices and the fruits of high investment) arepropitious for a fresh attempt to stabilise the cost of living. But governmentalactions affecting the Index have a psychological effect out of all proportion to the size of the movement involved. The further increase due in respect of rents andthe increases which are likely to arise in respect of the prices of the products of nationalised industries make it highly desirable that the Government should endeavour not to increase any further prices by its own direct action, and if possibleseek to reduce them. In this connection, taxation policy can be important(paragraphs 93 and 94).Procedure23. It would be necessary to discuss any proposed changes with the employers&apos;associations, and then with the T.U.C. These discussions should, if possible, becompleted by the autumn and should, therefore, be started as soon as ministers have decided what line they would wish to follow (paragraphs 105-107).17th February, 1958.
POLICIES IN REGARD TO  WAGES AND RELATED MATTERSReport by a Group of OfficialsSECTION IStability in the value of the pound, which is the same thing as stability in thegeneral level of prices, is a primary objective of the Governments economic policies&apos;.We are in this report concerned primarily with the internal value of the pound, butthe internal value and the external value are in fact inseparable.2. The objective of stability in the general price level does not mean that eachand every price should be stable. Variation in price performs a useful and necessaryfunction. Some prices should go up, e.g., to meet increased costs, to elicit greatersupplies, or to meet the requirements of other important policies, such as housing.In these circumstances, general stability is possible only if other prices go down.Some prices have in fact gone down even in the past five years: but not to such an extent as to offset increases in other prices. Reductions in price are possible overa wide field if increased productivity in industries (mainly manufacturing industries),where fast increases in productivity are possible, is not entirely absorbed intoincreased wages or increased profits.3. In view of the many diverse factors involved (some of them outside theUnited Kingdom) it is not to be expected that the objective of general stability inprices will be attained in a precise arithmetical sense. This, however, does notimpair the value of the concept as an objective of policy. In aiming at generalstability, it may be possible at least significantly to reduce the rate of increase inprices, and even that would be a great gain. The measurement of general stability in prices gives rise in practice to some difficulties, which are discussed later(paragraph 92). For the present we take as the objective of policy that the index of the price of total final output* should be stable. This is the most comprehensiveindex of the value of money and includes also export prices.4. The proportion in which the various factors of production enter into theprice of final output varies from industry to industry and from year to year: butthe composition of the price of total final output at present is roughly as follows:  Per cent.(i) Income from employment, mainly wages and salaries ...      49(ii) Income from self-employment    ............(iff) Company trading profits before depreciation  ...... 12(iv) Other trading income and rents............ 5(v) Net Taxes (indirect)       ............... 10(vi) Imports of goods and services    ............ 17Total..................... 1005. In general, a condition precedent (but not the only condition) for stability in the general price level, is that the rate of increase in incomes as a whole (wages,salaries and other incomes) should not exceed the rate of increase in the volumeof final output. The weight of wages and salaries in final output makes it inevitableas a matter of arithmetic that attention should be concentrated on this item in anyattempt to establish the condition precedent for price stability: but neitherarithmetic nor psychology would permit the ignoring of the other items.6. In Appendix I we attempt to quantify the rate of increase in wages andother incomes which is likely to be consistent with price stability over a period. Onthe basis of post-war experience, the average increase in productivity per head ofthe working population might be between 1-8 and 2-2 per cent, per annum, and* Final output is the sum total of the goods and services available for private and public con-sumption, investment and export. It is equal to the gross domestic product, plus imports of goods and services.
an increase of this rate in average earnings might be compatible with stability in theprice of final output. Any wages policy, however, has to be directed at wage ratesand basic salaries and not at earnings, for these form the subject of the mainnational negotiations between the unions and the employers&apos; organisations. Actualearnings are affected by other matters overtime, incentive payments and the like which are not susceptible to centralised settlement, even if this were desirable.The calculations in Appendix I suggest that the increase in basic wage rates andbasic salaries which might be consistent with stability in the price of final outputmight be between 1 -5 and 1 -8 per cent, per annum.7. Item (vi) in the table in paragraph 4 Imports of goods and services isunlike the other items in the table,&apos; inasmuch as the factors which determine theprice of these are for the most part beyond the control of the United Kingdom.Imports may be regarded as constituting between one-fifth and one-sixth of theprice of final output. This is not a very large proportion, but import prices inparticular, and external economic events in general, can exercise a significant effecton the level of internal prices. For example, the upsurge of import prices at thetime of the Korean War led to a complete breakdown in the wage restraint policyof the Labour administration: in 1951 retail prices went up by 12 per cent, andwage rates by 11 per cent. No wage policy can withstand violent fluctuation ofthat kind: nor can the price level in the United Kingdom be insulated to any great extent or for any long period from the trend of prices abroad. These facts canraise formidable difficulties for any policy of price stabilisation and wage restraint and show the need for some flexibility in price and wages policies. Small changesin import prices, however, should be absorbable without too much difficulty: forexample, a 5 per cent, rise in import prices means, other things being equal, a rise of less than 1 per cent, in price of final output.SECTION IIPossible Wage Policies8. There is some ambiguity about the idea of a governmental wages policy.The traditional Government attitude has been one of non-interference with the processes of collective bargaining, and periodic attempts to secure wages restraintby exhortation or by general economic measures have not been inconsistent withthat attitude. In so far as a wages policy is by definition an attempt by Governmentto impose some pattern or exercise some restraining influence upon wage-adjustments otherwise than by exhortation or by general economic measures, thepolicy for many years has been avowedly not to have a wages policy. We consider in the following paragraphs these possibilities:  Continuation of present system and policies.Centralised wage-fixing systems.Middle courses.Continuation of Present System and Policies9. The traditional British system of wage determination is by &quot; free collective bargaining &quot; between workers and their employers, originally by firms or bydistricts and later (as trade union organisation became stronger and employersorganised to meet this) by national agreement for each industry. Approximately450 industry-wide wage agreements are made annually. There is more than onemethod or arriving at agreements (e.g., through Joint Industrial Councils or throughdirect negotiation), but by far the largest part of the field is covered by these agreements. The main exception is industries covered by Wages Boards orCouncils. Conciliation by the Ministry of Labour and voluntary arbitration maybe regarded as extensions of collective bargaining, not exceptions to it, because theycan only be successful if the parties are prepared to accept it, or abide by the results.Compulsory arbitration as under the Industrial Disputes Tribunal is an undoubtedexception, but this is a relic of war-time legislation.10. Collective bargaining is sometimes described as a jungle-law. Each tradeunion puts its own interests first, and its full-time and part-time officials are judged
by their success in doing so and by little else. This attitude produces a certainamount of competition in wage claims. The T.U.C. in propitious circumstances can take a national viewpoint on industrial affairs and for some years was prepared togive a general blessing to wage restraint, but the T.U.C. has no control over itsconstituents&apos; wage policies, and members of its General Council (who are of courseservants of their unions and not of the T.U.C.) can take a statesmanlike attitude togeneral propositions and at the same time a partisan attitude on claims by their ownunion. On the trade union side, therefore, there is a powerful vested interest inthe present system.11. The situation is different on the employers&apos; side. Employers have been rather reluctantly driven to organise by the pressure of trade union strength. their organisation is not so coherent as that of the unions: there are far fewer full-timeofficials and these are much more closely controlled by the members. Employersmight therefore seem more likely to be prepared to look at alternatives to the presentsystem, but they would need to be convinced that any alternative system would yieldbetter results from their standpoint, i.e., not oniy a better control on wages costs,but at least as good an industrial relations atmosphere. It is also likely that theaverage employer would be in favour of returning to something like plant-bargaining rather than merging his individuality in some larger entity still orsubservience to some central wage-fixing body.12. Resistance to change in this field is, however, by no means purely aproduct of conservatism and vested interest. A strong case can be made out forregarding the &quot; British system &quot; as the best system yet evolved for the settlementof wage claims in a free economy. The strike record in this country has been, atleast until 1957, amongst the lowest of large industrial countries. Despiteoccasional outbursts of ill-feeling and platform invective, there is a considerable measure of goodwill behind collective bargaining in this country, and this has bothfostered, and been fostered by, the very considerable measure of responsibility andreasonableness to be found on both sides of the bargaining table. There is,moreover, a danger that any changes which diminished the status of individualunions or associations in favour of more centralised bodies, would weaken influence over individual workers and businessmen.13. The existing system of wages in the United Kingdom has, however, been associated with persistent price rises in the post-war years. There remain thequestions of how far the system inevitably leads to inflationary wage settlementsunder conditions of high demand, and how far adjustments in the general economic climate can influence wage settlements or neutralise their effect on the price level.14. The system of collective bargaining as it exists to-day has grown up overa century under economic conditions which were fundamentally different from thoseobtaining to-day. Employers have little incentive to refuse wage increases unless they believe that by granting them they will not be able to maintain the volume oftheir business or the standard of their profits: but persistent price rises and thecontinuance of a state of high demand have created among employers and workersalike a belief that increased costs can always be passed on without damage to thevolume of business and employment or the standards of profits and living. On theunion side, annual wage claims have become habitual following upon annual unionmeetings: and the settlements have not been confined merely to maintaining thestandard of living of the workers. The position is little, if any, better in regard tosuch wage claims as are settled through arbitration and Wages Councils becauseall these bodies were designed to produce the same kind of answer as collective bargaining would have produced, and by light of the same considerations.15. It is sometimes suggested that the condition precedent for price stabilitycan be satisfied without need for any other change, merely by ensuring that production increases fast enough to equal whatever increases in money wagesthe system produces. The example of Germany, where price stability has beenreconciled with a growth in money wages very similar to that in this country, is sometimes quoted in this connection. There is, however, no justification for believing that, even were every effort being made to push production, rates olincrease^on the scale needed to equal the growth of wages over the past five years or so could be achieved. Post-war experience shows, moreover, that attempts^ toencourage production by excessive stimulation of effective demand at home (whichis susceptible to Government influence through fiscal and monetary measures) areliable to be self-frustrating by bringing on balance of payments crises.
* The Council on Prices, Productivity and Incomes.t In the case of the Netherlands the 22 per cent, increase is in rates: the corresponding increasein wage rates in the United Kingdom would be 24 per cent. It is believed, however, that increases in earnings in Holland do not differ radically from increases in rates-perhaps in part because paymentat rates in excess of those prescribed are illegal.16. It can be argued that the Government has not yet exhausted thepossibilities of changing the trend in wage settlements without any change whateverin the existing machinery of collective bargaining. This argument is based on theview that the campaign for public enlightenment on the effects of wage inflationwhich has been running for more than eight years now, cannot be expected toproduce rapid results: but it may in the end have considerable effect. In addition,some help towards effective understanding of the problems by the public maybe expected from the Cohen Councils Then again, the experience of the presentwage round may show that Government policies of exhortation and general economic measures have had some effect, at least for the time being. For example,wage increases in the next few months might prove no greater than the amount of increase in the Retail Price Index since the last settlements, and unless someextraneous cause resulted in a steep rise in the Index, this would produce, for thetime being at least, a reduction in the rate of wage increases.17. There is also the question whether the Governmenfs present economic policies could be intensified or prolonged, so as to reproduce something like thecircumstances under which the system of collective bargaining previously operatedwithout seriously endangering the price level. If a level of unemployment highenough to give price stability were adopted as an objective, there is no doubtof the Governmenfs ability to create it. But the experience of other countries doesnot bear out the view that unemployment at 3 or 4 per cent, is in itself enough toprevent excessive wage increases, and Ministers have themselves indicated thatthey have no intention of creating mass unemployment. The object of the measuresof 19th September was to disturb the confident expectations, that cost increasescould always be passed on in prices without loss of sales, which had for longnourished the continuing inflation. They have had the effect of slowing down the pace of the present round of wage claims and of causing some hesitancy amongthe unions. But, at some stage, expansion will doubtless have to be resumed: and unless, in the interim, there is a significant change, either in the present system or inthe approach to it by all concerned, there must be seme fear that a repetition of thespiral of wages and prices will take place. These considerations point towards thedesirability of a governmental policy in regard to wages, over and above general policies governing the economic climate if indeed a specific practicable policy canbe found.Centralised Wage-Fixing Systems18. References are made from time to time to the possibility of a national wages policy, by which is usually meant wage-fixing machinery of the kind nowextant in the Netherlands, Sweden and Australia and of the system current inthe United States in the war and early post-war periods. A detailed commentaryon these systems is given in Appendix II.19. We have examined the question of how far the systems in theabove-mentioned countries especially in Europe have contributed towardsstability in prices. It must be said at once that in none of the three countries hasthe value of money been stabilised for any prolonged period. Between 1952 and1956 consumer prices rose by 9 per cent, in the Netherlands and 11 per cent, in sweden and earnings in manufacturing by 22 per cent, and 20 per cent.t InAustralia, the increases were 15 per cent, and 26 per cent. The experience of theNetherlands and Sweden has, nevertheless, been better than that of the UnitedKingdom: over the same period, consumer prices here rose by 15 per cent, and earnings by 31 per cent. The range was equally wide for wage-costs in manufacturing, which remained virtually stable in the Netherlands, rose by 6 percent, in Sweden and by 14 per cent, in the United Kingdom.Such comparisons cannot themselves demonstrate that it is the differentinstitutional arrangements for determining wages which have caused the record tobe better in the other countries.  The facts which influence wages and prices are
many and complex, and there have certainly been other differences in thecircumstances of the different countries which have influenced the outcome. Thereis, nevertheless, perhaps some presumption that the institutions have heiped. Thispresumption is strengthened by the particular experience of the Netherlands during and after the Korean boom. When the boom began, general agreement wasreached that wage policy should be framed explicitly to lower real wages by asmuch as 5 per cent. Real wages, in fact, fell considerably below the 1948 leveland it was not until 1954 that they were restored to that level. Such an example of self-discipline is difficult to parallel anywhere. Perhaps the most remarkabledifference between these European countries and the United Kingdom lies, however,in the degree of public understanding of the price problem. The arrangements in the Netherlands and Sweden are based on a recognition (by trade unions aswell as others) of the fundamental role of wages and of the need for governmentalor centralised action. While it may be argued that this greater degree of understanding is a cause rather than an effect &quot;of the difference in institutions, itis difficult to believe that the institutional arrangements have not also helpedunderstanding.20. All the systems described in Appendix II, apart from the United Statessystem, have characteristics which are fundamentally different from free collective bargaining as it has grown up in this country with its large number ofindustry-wide agreements, its absence of strong centralised authorities among theunions or employers&apos; organisations and the long history of its development. Evenif the systems in other countries e.g., the Netherlands and Sweden were accepted as more effective in helping to produce price stability, it does not follow that they would be suitable for imitation in the United Kingdom.The Netherlands system is, in substance, a determination by the State, throughthe College of Arbitrators, of wage increases: the major considerations are theeffect on wage levels as a whole and on the economy. It grew out of the special difficulties in the Netherlands in the post-war period and has been supported by measures of price control.Under the Swedish system agreements are concluded between the nationalorganisations about recommendations on general issues, such cis W3.2C increases,and these recommendations are generally accepted by the constituent members.The system depends significantly on the accepted control of the National TradeUnion Federation and the National Employers&apos; Association over their constituentmembers. The working of the system is no doubt made easier by the generalsocial climate in Sweden and by the very close relations between the trade unions and the Government.21. It is clear that the adoption of any of these systems in the UnitedKingdom would involve a revolutionary break with traditions which have been built up over a century. The feasibility of such changes would depend on acomplete alteration in the present mental climate, and on persuading people thatthe present system was inadequate and that the changes proposed were right and appropriate. Irrespective of the intrinsic merits of these other systems, we donot think such changes are in present circumstances feasible.Middle Courses22. From time to time various middle courses between unrestricted collective bargaining on the one hand and centralised wage-fixing machinery on the other,have been mooted. Most of these have many characteristics in common and much the same issues in terms of practicability, usefulness and acceptability arise in regard to all of them. All are open to objections of one kind or another: butthey must be weighed against the existing and not against a perfectionist system.23.  Proposition A. The main features and variants of this proposition are: (i) Announcement of a tolerable rate of increase in basic wage rates. Thereshould be an announcement of the rate of increase in basic wage rates *and basic salaries* which seems likely over a period to be consistent with price stability.  The calculations in Appendix I suggest that this* For this purpose basic rates include hours of work, and any change in the standard week would be deemed a change in basic rates.
rate might lie between 1 -5 and 1 - 8 per cent, per annum. There would,however, be objections to so precise an announcement. In the firstplace, the figures are subject to a considerable range of error and itwould be desirable to avoid an air of spurious accuracy. Moreover itseems unlikely that any proposal based on a rate of increase of lessthan 2 per cent, a year would command sufficient support. In thecircumstances an increase of 2 per cent, per annum in basic wage ratesand salaries seems to be the best answer which we can provide at present.This would be an increase in real wages in so far as the objective of price stability was secured. The figure might, in the event, prove to be on thehigh side, but not to a serious extent if it were observed throughout the major part of the field.(ii) Period. The declared rate might be for a year ahead only, or preferablyfor a longer period, so as to allow for the inevitable fluctuations in therate of increase in production from year to year. In any case, however,the figure would need to be reviewed periodically in the light of experience.(iii) Method of announcement. There are various ways in which a figure oftolerable increase might be declared. Once the principle was accepted(this large proviso and the possible conditions for it are discussed later)there would not be room for wide disagreement about the figure: butSwedish experience suggests that great psychological importanceattaches to the processes and there is advantage in widespread publicdebate. It would be best if an agreed figure could emerge from a body on which the Government, the unions, and the employers were represented. Other possibilities are that the figure might emerge in areport by an advisory body (e.g., the Cohen Council), or might be proposed by the Government itself.(iv) Declared rate as a guiding light. The status of the figure would vary according to its provenance. If it were put forward by the government or the Cohen Council on their own account it might be no more than aguiding light to all concerned in the settlement of wages. It would, ineffect, be a conversion of the present vague advice into positive guidance to the effect that, in the view of the Government (or the Cohen Council),wage increases of more than, say 2 per cent, per annum were unlikely to be compatible with general price stability. This might be done without any change in the existing machinery, although the effectiveness of the guidance could be undermined if wage-fixing bodies, operating under Government aegis, made awards which ignored the guidance,without showing good cause.(v) Declared rate as an established norm. Alternatively, a stronger status forthe figure might be sought, based on a high degree of co-operation fromthe unions and the employers. The aim would be to get the declaredrate of increase widely accepted as a norm i.e., something which all workers might expect in the ordinary way of business. There could,however, be no question of seeking to freeze the existing pattern of wage rates; and further room for differentiation would exist in regardto earnings, e.g., through incentive bonuses, &amp;c. Differentials in wagesperform a necessary function in helping to attract labour to industries and firms where it is most needed and will do most good to the economy.On the other hand, there may exceptionally be cases where the workerscould insist on the normal increase only at the cost of their jobs, if theincrease would force the closure of the concerns. It would have to be understood, therefore, that there was room for elasticity in the norm,but only where exceptional circumstances were proved. There wouldhave to be agreement that exceptional cases could not be left for settlement between employer and employees only, for they involvea change of status as against other workers and the community as awhole. There would thus have to be provision for reference to arbitralbodies of cases where the workers sought more, or the employer offeredless, than the norm. The changes which would be needed in the present arrangements for arbitration, wages boards, &amp;c, are discussed icSection IV.
(vi) Sanctions. It is not contemplated that there would in any case be a legalsanction for breaches of the rate. The efficacy of the arrangement would depend on self-discipline among the employers and on publicopinion against those who strike without resort to the arbitral bodies orin defiance of an arbitral award. The right to strike would, of course,remain.(vii) Governmental support. However the declared rate was arrived at orpublished, the Government would have to do all in its power to sustain the rate in its dealings with public servants. (This is discussed in detail in Section III.) As far as the nationalised bodies are concerned, theGovernment would be expected at least to encourage them to observe the declared rate as a guiding light or as a norm in arriving at wage settlements.24. Proposition B. Lord Chandos recently expressed the view that when thecurrent struggle was over, employers would have to re-align their whole attitude towage claims. He suggested that industry should aim at wage agreements covering a longish period, say five years, and providing for regular increments, say 2\ pel-cent., in the basic wage for the standard working week. This suggestion has muchin common with Proposition A although, initially at least, there are certaindifferences between them. Lord Chandos apparently contemplated that theproposal would begin on an industrial basis, instead of under central auspices as inProposition A. Then again, initially it could be confined only to industries wherelong-term contracts were negotiated. Lord Chandos also suggested five-yearagreements, and this might involve determination for a longer period than underProposition A (see paragraph 23 (ii)). In practice, however, it is very likely thatProposition B would, as it developed, become more and more like Proposition A.Once it was established in the leading industries it would tend to become generalised.Moreover it gives rise to most of the same difficulties as Proposition A and canconveniently be discussed together with it.25. Both Proposition A and Proposition B are based on the concept that thenation can afford a steady increase in real standards year by year. In so far as thepercentage increase was well chosen, and in so far as disturbing elements were notintroduced by substantial rises in import prices, stability in prices could be securedand the normal annual increments would in practice turn out to be increases in real, as distinct from nominal, wages.26. Would ideas on the lines of Proposition A or Proposition B be likely tosecure agreement or even acquiescence by the main unions and employers?Clearly the variant of Proposition A (paragraph 23 (iv)) under which the declaredrate is only a guiding light would be less difficult for them to accept if only forthe reason that it would be easier to evade. We cannot, however, give a definite answer to the question and indeed we do not think this is possible, except afterconsultation about concrete proposals with the unions and the employers&apos;associations. It is true that the T.U.C. recently issued a statement saying that asolution of the wages /prices problem &quot;can only be achieved if all sections of thecommunity are willing to limit to some degree their freedom of action &quot;: but it isdifficult to be sure how far this represents a genuine change of attitude on the partof the T.U.C. Moreover, even if it does, it must remain very doubtful how farindividual unions would be prepared, in the event, to limit their increases to the expected national increase in productivity, and to agree to the need to prove anyexcess to the satisfaction of a body which was charged with taking into accountwider interest.As far as Proposition B is concerned, there has so far been no official T.U.C.expression of view, but personal views have been expressed by individual tradeunion leaders, some mildly favourable and others critical. The British Employers&apos;Confederation Bulletin has expressed doubts about the Chandos proposal, chieflyon the grounds that his arithmetic would involve an excessive mortgage on thefuture and that it has not yet been established that the troubles we have hadnecessarily imply a need for a drastic change in the present forms of collective agreement.It seems clear that if any ideas on the lines of Propositions A and B are to makeheadway, they would do so only if they are pressed by the Government and backedwith other measures to make them acceptable to the unions. Even if Proposition B53075
* Earnings tend to increase more rapidly than basic wages and more rapidly than can be accounted for by increases in overtime. This divergence between increases in basic wages and increases in earnings is known as. wage drift (see paragraph 3 of Appendix 1).could start at the industrial level, its prospects would not be bright unless the unionsinvolved were satisfied that the cost of living would not continue to rise at recentrates and that other unions would not secure better terms for their members through an annual struggle.27.   Apart from the question of acceptability to  the unions and theemployers, the propositions can be criticised on various grounds as follows:  (a) Whatever rate of increase is taken (and the evidence suggests that it oughtto be rather lower than that mentioned by Lord Chandos) there couldbe no guarantee that output would in fact expand to this degree. Inso far as output expanded on average at a lower rate, increases in personal incomes at the rate indicated would tend to raise prices.(b) Under the various propositions the result is likely to be that less well organised workers would obtain the average national rate and the more highly organised workers would extract a higher rate, so that the totalincreases would exceed the increases in output. In addition there wouldbe strong pressure from workers at present content to receive increasesat intervals longer than one year (e.g., doctors and teachers) to obtainincreases currently every year.(c) It has been suggested that under the existing arrangements some workersdo not obtain annual increments. Under Proposition A, and underProposition B in so far as it was generalised, these workers would expect to obtain increments and so add to the pressure on prices.(d) Both propositions relate only to basic wages. Even if employers as a wholeobserved the rules, many of them might quite well give greater increasesthan would be justified, in order to obtain labour. There would beopportunities for this, and the additional payments could easily becloaked under overtime payments, bonuses or better conditionsgenerally.(e) Under Proposition A (and under Proposition B as it became generalised)there might be grounds for pensioners to claim a share in the increasingnational output, and so increase the burden of the ex-workers uponthe community and of State pensioners upon the Budget.28. There is some answer to most of the objections in the preceding paragraph, which tends to judge the propositions on the basis that the existing system is satisfactory.The objections raised in (a), (b), (c) and (d) in paragraph 27 have to be looked at against the background that wage rates have increased over the past three years at an average of more than 6 per cent, per annum. Even if one assumed aconsiderable margin of failure in any new policy, there would still be a long wayto go between the declared rate and the kind of increases which we have seen overthe past few years. It is true that individual employers might pay more in orderto obtain labour, but that happens already. Under the new propositions, suchwage drift* should at least begin from a much lower level than it otherwise would,although some of this advantage might be lost in so far as the extent of drift thenincreased. In this connection, however, there is the possibility that in a new approach to this problem employers might show a greater sense of solidarity and discipline.It seems doubtful whether there is substance in the objection at (c) inparagraph 27. In 1956 increases in wages were not reported for only 175,000manual workers out of the total of over 13 million manual workers covered by theMinistry of Labour wage rates statistics. There are about 2 million manual workersnot covered by the Ministry of Labour statistics. These are mainly unorganisedworkers and workers whose rates of wages are subject to agreement concern byconcern: there is no evidence to warrant a belief that their wages do not move in which the same way as in those industries for which statistics are available. Nocomparable information is available in regard to the remainder of people in civil
employment-about 8 million in all. It is possible to think of one or two categorieswhere increases have been low and infrequent, but in general it is a fair presumption that salary increases have been going on at much the same pace as wage increases,although in some cases increases may be belated, partly on account of the factthat they are not normally negotiated at yearly intervals.The point taken in regard to pensioners ((e) of paragraph 27) is an important one: but the objection is not insuperable. In recent years the main efforts of pensioners have been to maintain, not very successfully, the real standards of their pensions in the face of rising prices. In so far as the new system made for stability in prices, it would be a great advantage to them. This does not mean that itwould be right for ever to exclude pensioners from participating in the increasingnational product, and the standard of pensions might be revalued periodically in&apos;the light of the experience of any new policy in regard to wages and prices. Itwould, however, be wrong to undertake from the beginning that they should haveincrements: they would have to wait until it could be seen whether or not othermembers of the community, and particularly the active workers, showed willingnessin practice to curtail their own demands, so that this would be possible.29. Proposition C. In paragraph 16 it was suggested that wage increasesover the few months ahead might in the event be no greater than increases in the retail Price Index: this might provide a basis for a continuing policy. the proposition (C) would be that increases which have taken place in the retail price Index should be used as a guiding light or norm for wage increases in much the same way as indicated for Propositions A and B. (In theory falls in the retail price Index should result in falls in wage-rate, but it would be unrealistic to includethis in the proposition.) The main difference in the application would be thatinitially the figure would be higher than 2 per cent, (on the present round it mightbe 4 per cent.) but in successive years it should, other things being equal, taper off.30. The following considerations are relevant to the assessment of thisproposition:  (i) Though wage claims are supported by a variety of arguments, the costof living argument has always been in the forefront, and even if theactual rise in the cost of living since the last claim has been small,subsequent rises are anticipated in the claim. The grant of cost of livingincreases should remove the validity of this argument. It is true thatthis might iead merely to more emphasis being put on the otherarguments for wage increases, but in general these command lesssympathy from the general public.(ii) The basis of the proposition is probably more readily understandable by workers than the basis of Proposition A, for they are fairly familiar withthe notion of the Retail Price (cost of living) Index. There would alsobe some inducement to manufacturers and others to keep prices downsince they would know that this would have a direct effect onmoderating wage and other costs. Moreover, the argument from thecost of living is of universal application and may avoid raising thedifficulties about differences between increases in national productivity and increases in the productivity of particular industries. On the otherhand, the universality of its application has its drawbacks. The increase would have to be available for all workers and salary earners, and itmight be expected that profits, dividends and incomes from self-employment would rise similarly. More serious it would provide a ready-made argument for the yearly increase of pensions and other social benefits which are paid in cash,(iii) Hitherto Governments in the United Kingdom have not looked favourablyon the principle of directly linking wage rates and the cost of living:and experience elsewhere, e.g., in France, shows that in certain conditions such a link can be very dangerous. These conditions existwhen prices are rising steeply, e.g., because of general inflationaryconditions inside the country, or because of steeply rising prices ofimports. In reasonably favourable conditions, however, such a linkdoes not perpetuate price increases to as great an extent as might beexpected. If other elements affecting the Retail Price Index were stable(import prices and rate of indirect taxes) and productivity increased
as is presupposed in Proposition A and Proposition B, then the effectof wage increases in year 1 is very much diminished by year 3. Forexample, if the present round of wage claims resulted in an increaseof 4 per cent, in wage rates (corresponding to a rise of 4 per cent, inthe Retail Price Index) earnings might go up by 5 per cent. In the nextyear, however, the increase in Retail Price Index would be only 1-i- to2 per cent, and in the year following, less than 1 per cent. Even ifproductivity did not increase at all, there would still be a tapering of theeffect of wage increases in any one year on the Retail Price Index in subsequent years.(iv) The main objection to Proposition C is that the rate proposed in it is soobviously a floor. It would probably turn out to be merely aspringboard for additional claims based on the other reasons for wage increases which are usually put forward. In addition, a propositionof this kind is difficult to put forward as a basis for a policy to continueover several years or in the context of economic policies aimed atexpanding production and increasing productivity, in which the workerscan legitimately claim to share. Proposition C might, however, standby itself for a time and be regarded as a prelude to other policies, e.g.,those envisaged in Propositions A and B. Once, however, cost-of-livingclauses were built into wage agreements it might be difficult to removethem, and claims would no doubt be put forward eventually on a cost-of-living-plus basis.(v) The rate under Proposition C unlike Propositions A and B would automatically reflect (though after a period) changes in import prices.In this way Proposition C would provide a flexible method of dealingwith minor changes (particularly increases) in import prices, providedthat these could be passed on in export prices without damage to thebalance of payments objective. A sharp rise in import prices, however,would certainly make it necessary to revise the formula, especially if acorresponding rise in export prices could not be secured consistently with a sound balance of payments. Such revision would probably benot at all easy to secure.SECTION IIIPay in the Public Sector31. The public sector is regarded for the purpose of this memorandum as including the Civil Service (industrial and non-industrial), the National health service, and local authorities.32. For present purposes the public sector does not include the nationalised industries. These industries are in a special position. Ministers may informallyinfluence the policies of the management in regard to wages (and prices) but directintervention in wages settlements in these cases would certainly provoke strongtrade union opposition. In addition, the capacity of Ministers to influence thedecisions of management in these cases varies from industry to industry, and is rather greater where, as in the case of the railways, the Government is meetingcurrent losses. In the main, methods and criteria for settlements in the nationalised industries are akin to those in private industry and, in relation to the various proposals in Section II, wage problems in these industries would be better left for settlement as in private industry, subject to such informal influence as Ministerscan exert.Non-Industrial Civil Service33. All pay claims are negotiated between officials and representatives of thestaff. The officials represent the appropriate Minister; and since they take their instructions from him, any offers they make are within limits which the Governmentis prepared to approve. If agreement is not reached in negotiation, pay claimsup to the salary level of  2,050 may be referred to the Civil Service arbitration tribunal; and the awards of this tribunal are accepted as binding on the Government.
34. The Priestley Commission recommended that the primary principle forthe settlement of Civil Service pay should be fair comparison with the currentremuneration of staff in other occupations employed on broadly comparable work.This principle has been accepted without qualification by the Government, and aPay Research Unit has been set up to collect material about outside employmentsand to assess comparability. The Priestley Commission stressed the importance of comparison with current outside rates. It definitely rejected the idea of payadjustments on the basis of &quot; trends; &quot; and it dismissed the idea of adjustments in line with the cost of living as &quot; clearly unfair to the community.&quot;35. For the Civil Service above the arbitration limit, the Priestley Commissionrecommended an Advisory Committee, and the Government has set this up underthe chairmanship of Lord Coleraine. The Committee has no formal terms ofreference other than the Priestley Commission^ report, but it is clearly animplication of the latter that again the primary principle guiding the Committee&apos;sdeliberations should be &quot; fair comparison.&quot; The recommendations of theCommittee are not binding on the Government.Industrial Civil Service36. For the industrial Civil Service, the Government has accepted the fairwages resolution of the House of Commons; it is therefore committed to applyingin the Government Service the wage rates determined for the comparable trades in industry generally by national negotiations and arbitration. In this field also,therefore, the Government is firmly committed to following outside paymovements; the only difference is that in the industrial field it is wage rates withwhich comparisons are made, whereas the Priestley Commission accepted somecomparison with earnings for the non-industrial Civil Service.The Civil Service as a Whole37. The pay of the Civil Service is under Government control, subject onlyto the provision for arbitration for the middle and lower grades. The Cabinet has agreed that in present circumstances the principle of fair comparison must continueto be applied in pay negotiations; but the Official Side are instructed that they mustnot go beyond the bare minimum which can be regarded as consistent with this principle, and as a result arbitration may be resorted to more frequently than inthe past. In implementing any pay settlements reached either by negotiation orarbitration, the Government are insisting on their cost being offset by correspondingeconomies.38. A difficult problem will arise if the Government decides to adopt a new national wages policy and to use its control of Civil Service pay to establish the pattern required by that policy. Until such a policy has been generally accepted theGovernment cannot, without a breach of its commitments which would be bitterlyresented, abandon the principle of fixing Civil Service pay by fair comparison.And before the new policy could be applied to the Service, it would be necessary-to give notice to the Staff Side of the Governments intentions, and preferably toget their agreement to its adoption as part of policy applied to all occupations. if all went according to plan, and the pattern required by Government policy were successfully established on a national basis, its application to the Civil Service would still be consistent with fair comparison. Even so, there might still be cases wherefair comparison suggested something better; the Staff Side would have to accept thatsuch better terms could only be secured after reference to arbitrators, who wouldbe subject to the general injunction to give such treatment only in the exceptional circumstances contemplated in the new policy.Other Public Sector39. The table below sets out the employments included in this field, and theExchequer contribution towards the cost of their pay. .National Health Service StaffNew Towns Staff......TeachersPolice .........Probation Service StaffFire Service Staff   ......Local Authority General Grades%10010060505025Variable
For all these services, there is a regular procedure of the Whitley type for the negotiation of pay adjustments; the negotiations take place in councils composedof Management and Staff Sides. Agreements reached in these councils requirethe endorsement of Ministers in all cases except those dealing with Local Authoritygeneral grades. The extent to which representatives of the Ministers join in thediscussions on the councils varies from case to case; sometimes the Minister isunrepresented, sometimes his officials attend as observers, and sometimes thoseofficials have voting and speaking rights. But in no instance are the Ministersrepresentatives in a majority on a council. If disagreement is registered in a council, there is provision for arbitration, except in the case of teachers in Englandand Wales; in most cases this is by the Industrial Court or the Industrial DisputesTribunal, but the police and teachers in Scotland have their own abritrationmachinery.40. There are no clearly recognised principles for settling pay in this field.Both Staff and Management Sides use whatever arguments suit their immediatepurposes for example, what is being paid in comparable occupations, what is needed to improve recruitment, what is needed to &quot; keep up with the Jones&apos;s,&quot;what is needed to offset rises in the cost of living, and so on.41. The Governments control of pay settlements in the last-mentioned sectoris not satisfactory. It relies entirely on the Ministers power to approve or rejectagreements reached in negotiating councils; and if these powers are used otherthan exceptionally, negotiations in the councils will become unreal and the StaffSides will wish to conduct them direct with the responsible Ministers. Onesolution, to which the appropriate Departments are already feeling their way inthe case of teachers and New Towns staff, is to use the Ministers power as asanction to assert his authority over the Management Sides of the councils. If,by this means, a clear understanding is reached that Management Sides mustagree beforehand with Ministers what offers they can make, and keep within thelimits thus set, the control will be much more satisfactory.42. Reform on these lines is clearly not possible in the case of the LocalAuthority general grades, where there is no Ministerial power of approval andno Ministerial representation on the appropriate councils. Nor would such reformappear to be appropriate in the case of the Fire Service; again the Minister is not represented on the negotiating council, and the Exchequer contribution is now only 25 per cent, and will shortly be absorbed into the general grant. If it is accepted that the Local Authority general grades and the Fire Service staffs are outside the sphere of Government control, this ought to be made clear; and theHome Secretary should no longer be required to endorse agreements reached forthe Fire Service. Over the rest of the field, satisfactory control could be achievedon the lines suggested; this would, however, involve difficult negotiations with theLocal Authorities, particularly in the case of the police and the probation service.Given effective control, there are no principles to stand in the way of the application by the Government of a national wages policy in this sector.SECTION IVWages Councils, Arbitration and Conciliation43. Broadly speaking all these wages councils, arbitration and conciliation are part and parcel of the machinery of voluntary collective bargaining. Werefer later to the exceptional case of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal. arbitration and conciliation come into play when the parties cannot reach an agreement andthe services of a third party are thought to be desirable in order to devise an agreed settlement. Wages Councils are designed to produce the same results asvoluntary collective bargaining in industries which are not yet well enoughorganised to provide that machinery for themselves, though their recommendations are given statutory force.
Wages Councils and Boards44. Wages Councils and Boards are set up either under the Wages CouncilsAct, 1944, or under specific legislation relating to particular industries, e.g., cateringand agriculture. They had their origins in the agitation in the early part of thiscentury against sweated labour. Wages Councils submit to the Ministers their proposals for wages, &amp;c. in the trades under consideration. Statutory force isgiven to their recommendations and enforcement is supervised by Governmentinspectors. It might be thought that the need for protection of workers wouldhave much diminished in times of full employment, and indeed in regard to sometrades the Wages Boards do little more than rubber-stamp agreements arrived atoutside, between the employers and the workers.45. There are at present 66 Wages Councils and Boards in active operation including two Agricultural Wages Boards. They cover about million workers,or more than 20 per cent, of the manual labour force. The membership of theseboards generally consists of three independent members, and two membersrepresenting respectively the employers and the employed. There are about 70appointed independent members who occupy about 200 seats on the variouscouncils. Some community of outlook and consistency in decisions derives fromthe fact that most members hold more than one appointment, one or twoexperienced members hold as many as 10 appointments, and several hold five or six.46. Wages Councils and Boards have the effect of compelling wage increases in sectors where these might otherwise not take place. Indeed it is what they were set up to do. But they operate, for the most part, in the less well-paid industries and tend to follow rather than to fashion the wages pattern. The main criticism ofthe existing machinery is first that, owing to the domination of the employers&apos; side by the larger employers, the rates settled are often a severe strain upon the smallerman and secondly that the system of keeping up with outside rates tends to obtainfor wages council industries equivalent increases to those extracted in otherindustries by powerful unions or by workers who have special claims.47. Whatever the merits or demerits of the existing system there is little that can be done about it under the present dispensation. An attempt by the Ministerof Labour in 1948 and again in 1952 to influence wages councils by drawing their attention to Government publications in favour of moderation in demands for increases in personal incomes, had no useful results. There is no other possibility of limiting the action of wages councils by administrative action. Though the Ministercan refer back proposals of wages councils (even this is not possible in the case ofthe Agricultural Wages Board) he cannot alter, nor can he indefinitely postpone his assent to such proposals. In some cases these boards may have outlived theirusefulness for their original purpose, but there would be very great difficulties inpractice in seeking to abolish them in the face of substantial objections fromorganised workers and employers, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that there isno further need of them because there is adequate voluntary machinery. In the caseof the Catering Wages Boards the same general considerations apply, but any initiative for discontinuing them would lie in the hands not of the Minister, but ofthe Catering Wages Commission. Legislation would be necessary if it were desiredto abolish the Agricultural Wages Board.Arbitration48. The main Government-sponsored arbitration bodies are the industrial court, the Industrial Disputes Tribunal and the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal.Single arbitrators are also sometimes appointed by the Minister to act in individualdisputes. Independent members of the standing arbitration bodies, together withthe most frequently employed single arbitrators number 26. They are responsiblefor a large number of cases, and the yearly number of their awards averages over200.49. The amount of the wages field covered by arbitration varies substantiallyfrom year to year. Resort to arbitration may well increase if there is greaterresistance by employers to wage increases.50. The function of the arbitrator, as expressed in legislation, is to settledisputes. The arbitrator is not given any rules for his guidance, and he is notrequired and does not in practice generally give reasons for his findings. Arbitrators
Conciliation54. Legislation enables the Minister of Labour to provide a conciliationservice to assist in the settlement of industrial disputes a very large part of whichare unconnected with wage questions. Long practice makes the provision of this service almost inescapable. Conciliation does not involve determining the rate atwhich a settlement is reached, but is merely a process for assisting the parties toreach a voluntary agreement. In the present circumstances, however, when strikesmay be more tolerable than a continuance of inflationary wage settlements, it isclear that the Government must refrain from even appearing to exercise pressure upon the employers&apos; side to make concessions.Position Under Various New Propositions55. There remains the question of how far adjustments in wages councils,arbitration and conciliation arrangements would be necessary under the variouspropositions discussed in Section II.seem to have regard not only to the acceptability of their awards, but also to the capacity of the industry to pay, relativities in comparable trades, movements in thecost of living and increasing productivity in the industry in question.51. Various objections have from time to time been raised in regard to theoperation of arbitrators, and in particular the objections that they tend to set orconfirm the pattern of excessive wage increases, that they do not have regard to theeffect of their decisions on other industries, on prices and on the general economicsituation of the country, and in particular that the interests of the consumer are not adequately represented in consideration of wage claims.There is no evidence to establish the view that arbitration bodies tend to set the pattern of wage settlements: although an arbitration award in some cases, e.g.,engineering or railways, could do so. Even, however, if such cases do arise, the Arbitrator would, under the present system have an adequate answer by saying thathis award was the minimum at which the particular dispute could be settled withoutcostly stoppage. In regard to the second point, the arbitrator would probably saythat in so far as such information is made available to him he does have regard toit, but that (as the Morris Courts of Inquiry pointed out in 1955 and the Jack courts in 1957) it is not even possible to evaluate the effects of wage increases in singleindustries, such as in engineering and shipbuilding, let alone on the whole economy.Under the present dispensation, any attempt to secure direct representation of consumer interests at arbitration tribunals would encounter the objection from thetrade union side that it would upset the balance of arbitration boards and tend toweight the scales unduly against the workers&apos; side.52. The Government, in the Debates on the Economic Situation at the end oflast year, made clear their view that arbitrators in general should have regard to thenational interest in adjudicating on wage claims. It is very much a matter of judgment how far Government utterances of this kind can be pushed or should beoft-repeated. If, as under the present system, the arbitrator^ job is to produce asolution acceptable to both sides he may be expected in present circumstances to givethe workers at least something. He has to go with the main stream of wage settlements. The danger is that under the present system any attempt to influencehim contrary to the main stream of settlements would lead to evasion of arbitration and reduce the arbitrator^ usefulness in the peaceful settlement of disputes.53. Before leaving the subject of arbitration, mention should be made of theIndustrial Disputes Tribunal. This is somewhat of an oddity under the present arrangements in so far as it provides for arbitration at the wish of one party only and its decisions are binding. It is a relic of wartime legislation under which theright to strike was curtailed. The Industrial Disputes Order, under which thisTribunal operates, is dependent on Defence Regulations and would, in the absenceof any other action, disappear with them. The Minister of Labour is in consultationwith the Trades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederation on thequestion of whether compulsory arbitration should continue in any form. In theabsence of Defence Regulations legislation would be necessary for this.
Machinery under the guiding light proposal56. If the declared rate (whether based on expected increases in national productivity or increases in the cost of living paragraph 23 (iv) and paragraph 29)was merely a guiding light, the existing machinery in regard to wages councils and arbitration might be left to operate much as it does now. In effect, the guidancewhich has already been offered to the public, including arbitration tribunals, &amp;c,would be made more positive, and this would no doubt have some effect onarbitrators and independent members of wages councils, especially if the proposal was backed by both sides of industry.Machinery under long-term contracts proposal57.   The introduction of long-term contracts of the kind envisaged underproposition B would, in itself, require no change in the existing system.Machinery under established norm proposal58. The establishment of the declared rate as a norm (paragraph 23 (v))pre-supposes a high degree of co-operation from workers and employers. given that support, there would almost certainly be considerable resort to appeal byunions who claimed more than the declared figure and had not been able to get it, as well as by unions who had not been able to obtain even the proposed figure. Ifthe policy were to be successful, it would be essential that the award of a higherthan normal rate of increase should be quite exceptional. This could not beexpected to flow from the present system. This system is based on the view that employers&apos; and workers&apos; interests conflict and that a settlement somewhere between these conflicting views will produce a tolerable result for the rest of the community.This is not necessarily so under conditions of high demand, when employers are able to pass on increased labour costs in increased prices. The main function ofthe appeal body under the new system would be rigorously to restrict increasesabove the norm in wage rates and not only to produce a solution acceptable to immediate parties to the dispute.59. New arbitral bodies. It would, therefore, be necessary to set up specialbodies for determining such variations from the norm, and legislation would be needed for this. Existing arbitration bodies would need to be retained for dealingwith disputes and issues other than straightforward wage claims,* but they could hardly be expected to deal with the new task, which involves a radical change fromthe present conception of independent industrial arbitration. Wages Courts mightbe a suitable name for these special bodies. They might consist of an independent chairman, a representative of the workers and a representative of the employers.The chairman might be regarded as providing adequate representation of the public and consumers&apos; interest. If the bodies were to include a specific representative of consumer interests with voting powers, the unions would no doubt claim that theworkers&apos; side should be numerically equal to the employer and consumerrepresentatives together.60. Reference to, and awards of, Wages Courts. There would be difficult problems about the nature of reference to and awards by such Courts. Both partiesunder the proposal would be expected (but would not be legally obliged) to resort to the Court in respect of variations from the norm (paragraph 23 (v)) and itwould be clearly desirable to allow reference by one party only. This might not be acceptable to the employers, in so far as one can judge from their present attitudetowards the compulsory arbitration powers of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal.Then again, it is contemplated that there would be no sanction for the awards ofthe Court other than public opinion (paragraph 23 (vi)). The trade unions might,however, claim that there should be binding awards as a logical extension to arbitration at the request of one party only, and the employers, on present form,would oppose this.61. Amount of work for Wages Courts. There is a danger that in nearly all industries there would be demands from one side or another for variationsfrom the norm. This would, however, depend on how firm the backing of theemployers and the workers was in the beginning, and without full backing the* Among straightforward wage claims would be included claims for a reduction in hours withoutreduction in pay.
scheme is unlikely lo start at all. Even with a high degree of co-operation, there might well be a large amount of work for the Courts in view of the fact that thereare now about 450 wage agreements on a national basis and a much larger numberon a district or firm to firm basis. A considerable staff might be required by theCourts, but no estimate of the cost of such a scheme or of the staff required hasbeen made.62. Criteria for Wages Courts. The objections to &quot; guidance &quot; applicable topresent arbitration bodies would not apply with the same force to Wages Courts,and it would be appropriate in the new circumstances to give them some measureof guidance which, while not derogating from their ultimate independence of decision, would suggest certain criteria which they should employ in reachingtheir decisions. This would have to be done with the agreement of the two sides of industry, but the guidance would probably take the form of indicating the specialcircumstances which might justify variations from the norm. Among these mightbe:-(i) Is the industry or occupation under-manned?(ii) If so, how serious are the consequences of the under-manning for thebusiness and for the community?(iii) Have all practicable steps been taken to meet manning difficulties by increasing the supply of labour (removal of restrictions of entry and work); by increasing the efficiency of labour (by investment, worksorganisations and removal of restrictive trade practices)?(iv) Will increased wage rates cure under-manning or merely raise the priceof the existing labour supply?(v) Are wages out of line with those in similar employment in other industries and occupations?63. Comment on criteria. Criteria (i) to (iv) are largely self-explanatory.The object of criterion (v) is to help rectify anomalies which exist or may creep intothe wages structure. It must be assumed that the present wages structure, whichhas been evolved in the course of time out of collective bargaining, has more right in it than wrong: but there will, none the less, be some cases which need rectificationeven now. Then again, the effect of prescribing a norm for wage rate increases mayover a period give special advantages to workers in those occupations which, fromtheir very nature, are more subject than others to wage drift: this could have theeffect of altering the status of some other workers (e.g., civil servants) and therewould be need, as now, for periodic reviews in order to bring them into line again.As was indicated in paragraph 23 (v) of Section II there could be no question offreezing the existing wage pattern. Elasticity would be left in the system not only through the sanctioning by arbitrators of departures from the norm in exceptional cases, but also by reason of the fact that concerns would, of course, be free to adjustbonus and incentive payments, as well as other benefits, in accordance with theirexisting practices. Criterion (v) would, in effect, preserve the existing criterion offair comparisons in the public service.There would doubtless be difficult problems in the application of these criteriato particular cases, although arbitration bodies are thought to take some of the criteria into account even now. In this connection Wages Courts might find itnecessary also to seek evidence from other bodies in addition to the immediateparties to the case.64. Exclusion of profitability from criteria. Much is made in wage claims ofthe profits of an industry if these are notably large, though nothing is said by the claimants about losses (e.g., in the railways). In the new circumstances the argumentfrom profitability is both irrelevant and dangerous because, if it were successfullypleaded, industries in a position to pass on increased costs would be able to break the pattern with ease and still maintain their profits. For these reasons the test ofprofitability is not included among the suggested criteria. This omission mightwell give rise to difficulty with the unions. It would be desirable therefore to takewhatever practicable steps can be taken to dissuade employers from taking advantage of labour costs being lower than they might have been under a completely free system to increase profit margins. This point is discussed inSection V on prices and profits.
65. Exclusion of productivity from criteria. The exclusion from the criteriain paragraph 62 of any reference to productivity in the industry in question may bedebatable. In many industries and occupations, there is no measure of productivity,and it would be unfair to allow those industries in which productivity can be measured to get ahead of the norm for that reason. Moreover, the possibilities of increased productivity vary enormously from industry to industry and have oftenlittle to do with the efforts of the workers. Sometimes, for example, large increases in productivity arise out of the injection of large amounts of capital, which have tobe provided from outside the industry: and there is no reason why the workers inthe particular industry should have any special benefit from it. The capital has tobe serviced and the remaining benefit ought to be spread around in the form of reductions, or the avoidance of increases, in prices. Moreover, increases in productivity are, in many cases, automatically rewarded by increased piece-workrates, bonuses, and the like, which are only infrequently reflected in basic wage rates.66. Publication of grounds for awards. Under the existing system,arbitrators do not generally give any explanation of how their awards are arrivedat: there may be much to be said for this when cases are being dealt with on an ad hoc basis, for there is always a danger that publication of the reasons for an award may dissatisfy the disputants in the particular case and prompt other claims on the grounds which the tribunal has accepted in any particular case. Theposition would probably be different, however, where an application to a WagesCourt is for a departure from the norm, that is, for exceptional treatment. Theground of exceptional treatment to any section of the workers ought to bemanifestly justified, and there seems no way of doing this without publishing thereasons for the award. In addition, such publication might tend more readilytowards the building up of case law and precedent, and to the establishment of acommon approach to cases.67. Wages Councils. Consideration would have to be given to the positionof Wages Councils under the new conditions. In so far as they continued to operate,they might not only confirm normal increases, but also adjudicate in the light ofthe criteria in paragraph 62 on proposals for variations from the norm and make recommendations accordingly to the appropriate Ministers.Conciliation under the New Proposals68. The position of the Ministry of Labour conciliation service would be oneof some embarrassment. Once a guiding light or a norm had been established withthe support of the Government and at least a high degree of support in industry, itwould be impossible for a Government conciliator to mediate in the normal mannerin a dispute in which the trade union is claiming more and has refused to take thecase to arbitration or to the Court. The mere act of calling the parties together insuch circumstances could be represented as encouraging an unjustified breach ofthe guidance or norm, and even if the conciliator exerted no pressure whatever uponthe employers&apos; side (as he certainly would not) he would not escape blame if theultimate settlement were beyond the guiding light or the norm. In thesecircumstances the most the conciliator will be able to do will be to try to persuade the parties to accept reference to arbitration or to a Wages Court.SECTION VRelated Matters and Policies69. The greater the change from the existing system of wage settlement, thegreater will be the difficulty of securing the co-operation or acquiescence of the1 unions. Adequate co-operation from them may not be forthcoming in any case,but it will almost certainly not be available unless the Government is able to give assurances in regard to profits, prices and dividends. This raises some formidabledifficulties.Profits70. In paragraph 4 we indicated the relative weights of the various elements(including wages and profits) entering into the price of final output.  The bulk of
profits and wages, however, arise from companies and public corporations. It istherefore appropriate that in consideration of profits questions attention should befixed on these. The profits of companies and public corporations beforedepreciation and taxation account for about 14 per cent, of the price of final output:after allowance for capital consumption, but before taxation, the amount is about10 per cent. So these profits, after capital consumption are only about one quarteras important as wages in amount. But the size and growth of profits are a matterof continuing concern to the trade unions.71. It may be argued that, just as a norm is proposed for wages, there shouldalso be a norm for profits or profit margins, so as to provide a similar restraint inthe growth of these. There are two grounds for this kind of argument: first thatin the absence of such arrangements reduced costs would be absorbed by higherprofits: second that, even if prices were held stable under the arrangements, theymight alter the division of the fruits of production between wages and profits.Apart from this, unions from time to time express the view that profits are insome absolute sense too big even now and ought to be cut back.72. The conception of a norm in regard to increases in profits or profit margins is quite inappropriate for the following reasons. Profits, being a residualitem (the difference between prices and costs), are inevitably subject to considerablefluctuations, both from year to year and from trade to trade: wages and wage ratesdo not fluctuate in the same way, and in particular wages have little downwardelasticity. Variation in the rate of profits (or losses) from industry to industry andfrom year to year are even more important than wage differentials for a properworking of the economic system: the existence or expectation of profit is the drivingforce which makes for economic expansion in those areas where it is economicallyjustifiable, and any attempt to freeze or standardise profits or profit margins would lead to the fixing of the pattern of industry in a highly damaging way. It wouldbe impracticable to fix sensible standards of profits for the whole range of industryand commerce. As far as profit margins are concerned, these are dependent also on the amount of turnover which cannot be firmly predicted.73. Even if the unions could be persuaded that profits and profit marginscould not and should not be regulated, they might still claim that the acceptance ofa norm for wage increases might be used by employers as a means of increasingprofit margins, and so affect the distribution of the fruits of production as betweenwages and profits. Over a period the proportion of domestic incomes which goes tocorporate profits is remarkably stable: it was 19 per cent, in 1948 and it was still19 per cent, in 1956. The effect of continuous wages pressure has not been to alter the distribution of national income as between wages and profits, for employershave been able to maintain profits and profit margins at the figure which theyconsider requisite by putting up prices. This does not prove that, if wages pressurewere relaxed, employers would not merely take the opportunity of increasing profitsinstead of reducing prices. The available evidence suggests, however, that profitsthemselves do not play a dynamic role in relation to prices: they tend over a period to follow the movements in other elements of costs. There may from time to time be a case for adjusting the distribution of income between wages and profits, but under conditions of high demand this cannot be done through wages pressure.Taxation is a powerful instrument for affecting distribution of income: and therate of tax on undistributed profits is already at a high level about 45 per cent.Even at the present level of taxation there is a tendency for prices to be put up tocover increased taxes, and this danger grows with the height of taxation. Moreoverin considering adjustments in profit taxation. Governments have to bear in mind the fact that corporate profits since World War II have become a very importantsource of finance for investment and development, and now provide about half ofthe total of such finance.74. There is a clear need for better public understanding of the role of profits in the economic system, their importance for investment, on which increases in production and standards of life significantly depend, and their relative smallness,especially after depreciation and taxation. Ministers might spread enlightenmenton this subject through their public speeches. The Cohen Council might be askedto deal with this problem in their reports. Companies generally might be encouraged to publish commentaries, as some of them do even now, on their ratesof profit.   We have considered whether understanding about profits and profit
margins might be improved if companies were under statutory obligation to publishwith their accounts a statement of the profit per unit of turnover or per pound ofcapital employed. Such an obligation would require legislation and would raiseformidable&quot; practical difficulties. In any case, However, we have come to theconclusion tiiat it would not be helpful, because profit margins inevitably showsubstantial variations from year to year, and it would not be practicable to find any year which could be regarded as normal.75. It would be better for all these reasons to make it clear that theGovernment do not think it practicable or desirable to attempt to standardise orregulate profits or profit margins. The main way of affecting the level of profits isthrough prices. The operation of competition ought to ensure that prices arereduced when costs go down and that margins are not increased, but as we shall seecompetition is imperfect.Prices76. It seems inevitable that under any system of wage restraint on the linesof propositions A, B and C, the Government would be expected to take moreinterest in prices generally and in the cost of living in particular.77. There is at present no general system under which prices are fixed. TheGovernment control a very few prices and may influence some others, e.g., thoseof the nationalised bodies. Generally speaking, however, prices are settled by the manufacturers or distributors individually or collectively at irregular intervals on no common criteria, and in the short run without any precise relationship to costs.In general, however, it seems that manufacturers and distributors aim to obtainwhat they think is a proper margin on their sales.Prices in the nationalised industries78. Prices in nationalised industries are likely to present special difficultiesin any campaign for price stability because labour productivity in several of these industries rises slowly much more slowly than in manufacturing industriesgenerally.  In this context, the coal industry is specially important.79. In the National Coal Board&apos;s publication &quot; Investing in Coal &quot; it was estimated that output per man year would improve over the 10 years to 1965 atan average rate of 1-4 per cent, per annum. In the seven years to 1956,productivity in the coal-mines increased at a rate of only about 1 per cent, a year:in the second half of 1957 it fell. Even if general wage increases are kept downto, say, 2\ per cent, per annum (i.e., corresponding with the norm of 2 per cent,increases in wage rates), and even if the increases in the wages of coal miners couldbe kept down to this figure, it seems inevitable, on the basis of past experience and the present attitude towards coal mining, that the relative price of coal would go up perhaps by about 2 per cent, per annum, of which wage costs might account for 1 per cent, or more and increased capital and other costs account for the balance.No doubt the closing down of uneconomic pits and the sinking of new pits will helpincrease productivity, but they cannot significantly affect the overall picture as faras the next four or five years are concerned.Increases in the price of coal significantly affect other nationalised industries.In gas, labour productivity rose 10 per cent, in the period 1949-1955, or 1-6 percent, per annum on average. Unless there were a great improvement in productivity in gasworks, increases of 1\ per cent, per annum in wages would inevitably resultin some increases in the price for gas, despite the fact that labour costs are a relatively small proportion of total costs, and so would the increase in coal prices.It would be imprudent to assume that increases in prices would be significantlyless than increases in wages. Electricity helps the general overall fuel and powerpicture, because (as in gas) labour costs are relatively small and there have beengreat increases in efficiency partly through massive investment, partly throughstriking economies in fuel utilisation, and partly through rapid expansion in output.As jl result, electricity prices rose only 14^ per cent, in the six years 1949-1955,i.e., at rather less than half the rate of increase in prices generally. Even with anincrease in the price of coal on the lines above and an increase in wages of say2-1 per cent., it might be possible to avoid increases in electricity prices. Much,however, would depend on how far the electricity authorities are required to financetheir own development out of profits and on the long-term rate of interest.
Over the whole field of fuel and power it seems likely that, even under a successful wage policy, prices would have to rise at little less than the rate of increase in wages.80. It is much more difficult to measure increases in productivity in transport,which would be affected by increased fuel costs. In some cases, e.g., bus drivers,increases in productivity can come only out of more economical running which means generally reduced services. In regard to railways, however, it may be possiblefor the massive investment which is now taking place, coupled with increased efficiency, to keep fares and freights from rising steeply and yet make the railwaysself-sufficient.81. In view of the above it would be a mistake to launch a campaign forgeneral price stability on the basis that prices in these nationalised industries wouldbe prevented from rising unless the Government were prepared to contemplatesubsidies with their distorting consequences for the economy and their burden onthe taxpayer. The private sector as a whole is wont to claim that it cannot beexpected to hold its prices stable if the prices of the nationalised bodies are increased. It is essential to combat this view. Some private industries, wherefuel and power and transport costs are large in relation to their total costs and productivity rises slowly, could not be expected to absorb increased power andtransport costs. But the cost of coal, gas and electricity is only about 6 per cent,of the value of manufacturing output generally, so that an increase of 2\ per cent,in the price of fuel and power need occasion only an increase of 0-15&quot; per cent,in manufacturing costs an amount which it should be possible to absorb without difficulty. Small increases in prices of fuel and power ought not to be accepted as an excuse for increasing prices generally. In regard to the freight and passenger services provided by B.T.C., it should be noted that these account for only about per cent, of total final output, so that every 5 per cent, increase in freights andfares increases the cost of total final output by 0-15 per cent. Admittedly theeffect in particular cases (e.g., commuters) may well be noticeable and the psychological effect tends to be made greater through exaggeration. The important point is that general stability in prices can be secured even if the prices of the nationalised bodies are raised, for other prices, and especially those of manufacturedgoods, ought to fall.Price Control82. It might be suggested that the Government should, in return for theacceptance by the unions of a norm for wage-rate increases, institute control overa wide range of prices, and in particular those which affect the cost of living.83. The main powers under which price control was exercised during thewar and in the post-war period have been been revoked, but under Regulation 55AB certain Government Departments, still have powers to regulate the prices ofa small number of commodities. New powers would have to be taken by legislationif a general system of price control were to be reintroduced.84. Control of food prices may appear easier than control of other prices in as much as foodstuffs are more homogeneous. Food prices, however, tend to reflect more quickly and more fully changes in the price of raw foodstuffs whichare largely imported, and it is doubtful whether any effective system of control could be devised without resort to wartime techniques of bulk Government purchase and subsidies or similar arrangements.85. In regard to textiles, clothing, and household goods generally, the variety of types and qualities is such as to make effective price control in normal timespractically impossible. It is little use fixing a price except for a defined article:and unless there is control over manufacture, with detailed specification of the types to be produced, it is easy for manufacturers to evade price controls by slightlyvarying the quality or design of the articles they make. This was one of the main reasons for the elaborate Utility schemes for clothing and furniture during the war.But even if price control specifications could be introduced they would not be madein preference to more profitable uncontrolled goods unless the manufacture of thelatter were severely restricted or prohibited.86.  To secure reasonably effective control of the prices of even a limitedrange of necessities a degree of regimentation of manufacture would therefore be
necessary which would hardly be tolerated in peacetime and would have disastrousrepercussions on our export trade. Further, the enforcement of any such control,especially on manufacturers, is extremely difficult and depends on a widespreadrecognition by traders that it is necessary and just. Without such general consentthe control would soon break down and the law be brought into contempt.Business men would also no doubt take the point that there is no suggestion forstatutory control of wages.Possible Action Short of Price Control87. Ministers have already exhorted manufacturers to lower prices wherever they can, and in particular not to refrain, because of trade arrangements, frompassing on reduced costs in lower prices. This exhortation arose in part out of reduced raw material prices and increased investment which might be expected toreduce costs. There are some dangers in exhortations of this kind under presentcircumstances. Lower raw material prices are not likely to have a significant and rapid effect upon prices of goods in the shops because of their relative unimportancein total costs and the time which it takes any changes in import prices to percolatethrough the system. Then, again, much of the investment which has taken placemay result in expanded rather than in cheapened output. The position would,however, be different under the various propositions which have been put forward for limiting increases in wage rates, because labour costs have an immediate andsignificant effect on total costs. In the new circumstances it would not only be right for the Government to exhort traders to lower prices but to seek the active co-operation of the main industrial associations in a campaign for lower prices inmany sectors. The precise form which this co-operation might take would need tobe discussed with these associations.88. The main governmental action which should help to ensure that lowercosts issue in lower prices is the encouragement of competition in the home market.It is essential to avoid running the economy flat out and thus creating excessivedemand which weakens competition. It is also desirable to reduce restrictive trade practices and arrangements, whether formal or informal, which impede price reductions.   Some steps have already been taken in this direction.89. The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, provides comprehensivemachinery for critical examination of collective agreements between firms on prices,discounts and other trading terms. Public registration of all such agreements iswell on the way to completion. Participants in registered agreements have to showbefore the Restrictive Practices Court that the agreements are in the public interest.The Court will shortly begin hearing the first cases. So far as single-firm monopoliesare concerned, the Board of Trade can ask the Monopolies Commission to reporton them. The Commission are at present inquiring into the monopoly aspect of four industries, which is about as much as they can handle at one time. Even inthe absence of registrable restrictive trade practices or monopolies, inertia or priceleadership* among manufacturers may impede justifiable price reductions. Howserious this would be remains to be seen: but there might be demands for provisionof machinery to investigate complaints (by trade unions or bodies representative of consumers) that prices in particular industries were continuing at an unduly high level having regard to the movement of costs and, in particular, labour costs.90. It is, moreover, for consideration whether the practice of individualresale price maintenance should be weakened, or, even, made unlawful. The1956 Act banned collective methods of enforcement of resale price maintenancebut gave individual manufacturers an extended right to seek injunctions againstdealers who do not sell at notified retail prices. Some manufacturers are now taking advantage of this provision and there has recently been comment in thePress and in Parliament to the effect that on the one hand the Government areurging traders to reduce prices while on the other they have put into the handsof traders a weapon which enables them to keep up prices whatever may be theinclinations of retailers themselves. A considerable proportion of goods sold inshops is subject to resale price conditions and the abolition of the system wouldbe likely to have a noticeable effect on the prices of a wide range of goods althoughit would not affect very significantly the goods which enter into the cost-of-living* The practice under which the price level is set by the leading firms in the industry and othersfollow.SECRET53075 E
index. The provisions in the 1956 Act were, however, a compromise and any modification in the law on resale price maintenance would cause difficulties ona number of fronts (for example, Women&apos;s organisations support the systembecause they think that it is a safeguard against degrading of quality) andespecially among a section of the Government^ own supporters. It might,however, be practical politics to change the law as part of a series of relatedmeasures on prices and wages.91. Liberalisation of trade (removal of quotas &amp;c.) is in our interests asexporters and has a beneficial effect on our prices at home. The more we can do, so as to force our manufacturers to be competitive in the home market, the better for our price level. On the other hand we cannot afford a substantial increase in our import bill until we have a stronger external monetary positionand the world trade outlook is more assured. The pace of trade liberalisationmust therefore be set by considerations relating to our external monetary position.Further liberalisation will, however, play an important part in keeping our economy competitive and the policy should be pushed forward as and when such considerations permit. The Free Trade Area, when it comes into being, shouldalso increase competition in the United Kingdom and help keep prices down, butthe movement towards that has its own momentum, which cannot be varied tomeet the requirements of a wages and price policy at home. In any case, it wouldbe some years before the full effect is felt.The Retail Price Index92. In paragraph 3 we mentioned that measurement of variation in prices(or the value of the pound) gives rise to some practical difficulties. We havehitherto in this memorandum been speaking about the price index of final output,but this is a concept unknown to the man-in-the-street. In Parliamentary answers,changes in the value of the pound are measured by changes in the ConsumerPrice Index. For the population as a whole, however, and for the purpose of wage agreements, the value of money is measured by the Index of Retail Prices.In the past there has been a substantial difference in the rate of increase in thevarious indices the Retail Price Index rising faster than the other two. To someextent this was due to special factors which are discussed in the following paragraphs.Between 1949 and 1956 retail prices rose at an average rate of about 5 per cent,a year. The main causes of rising prices in the post-war period have been risingmoney wages, the ending of rationing and subsidies, and higher import prices.Over the period the rise in food prices played a predominant role: increases inthe prices of the products of nationalised industries accounted for a substantial amount of the increase, as did the increase in rents. The average price of manufactures, however, has risen relatively little over the period much less thanwages have risen and this is mainly because productivity in this sector hasincreased quite rapidly.Outlook for 195893. It is reasonable to hope that, even if wages were to go up the same amount in 1958 as in 1957, there would be some slackening in the rate of increasein the Retail Price Index. The reductions which have already occurred in import prices should begin to have some effect (there is probably at least a six-month lagon average, though somewhat less for food prices). Whether the effect willactually be to lower prices depends on the size of the present wage round. Asfar as can be seen, therefore, circumstances are propitious for a fresh attempt tosecure restraint in wages and prices.94. Governmental actions which affect the Index of Retail Prices tend tohave psychological consequences out of all proportion to the size of the movementinvolved. It seems inevitable, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs 78 to 81that over a period of years increases will be required in the prices of fuel andtransport: and these are generally considered to be subject to influence by theGovernment. Then again, the decontrol of rents has still to become fully apparentin the Index. It appears desirable that the Government should if at all possiblebe seen at the same time to be making a positive contribution towards loweringthe price of some of the items in the Index.   In this connection, indirect taxes
are of special importance. Past experience suggests that benefits conferred uponthe workers through reductions of direct taxation or through increase in benefitssuch as family allowances, are not taken into account in wage demands. As faras wage policy is concerned, it would seem better to give any concession whichcan be afforded through the relief of taxation on items which enter into the retail Price Index.Dividends and Capital GainsDividends95. Proposals for a wages policy on the lines of the various propositionsdiscussed in Section II are certain to evoke on the trade union side proposals for the restraint of dividends. There is little or no economic argument in support of sucha proposal. Dividends have no causal effect on the level of prices: and as a matterof arithmetic they form a tiny proportion of personal incomes. The proposal fordividend limitation, however, is not so much based on economic arguments as onnotions about requiring equality of sacrifice from the wage-earners and the owners of capital. They cannot, therefore, be disposed of simply by economic arguments.96. The total amount distributed by United Kingdom companies in dividendson ordinary and preference shares has increased from  457 millions in 1948 to 800 millions* in 1957. The percentage increase of last year&apos;s figure over the figure for 1948 is 75 per cent, as against an increase from  2,172 millions to  3,670millions^ (68 per cent.) in companies&apos; total income during the period, and an increase from  6,185 millions to l 1,700 millions*(89 per cent.) in wage and salary payments tduring the period. Very little increase took place between 1948 and 1952 (duringmost of which period the Labour Governments informal dividend limitation policy was in effect) since 1952 there has been an increase in each year, particularly sharplybetween 1954 and 1955. The rate of increase has been less sharp from 1955 andonwards, and the recent general decline in profits may point at least to a furtherslackening in the rate of increase in dividend payments in the near future.97. There are already some factors at work to restrain distribution of profits.The rate of taxes (income tax and profits tax) on distributed profits is now 72-V percent., as compared with 58J per cent, in 1947 and 73J per cent, in 1951. There isalso pressure upon companies to retain adequate funds for development. Inaddition, Ministers have from time to time urged restraint in distribution. On theother hand, the directors of companies have to have regard to the proper claims ofthe shareholders, the need to make the equity attractive to potential investors(especially if recourse to the market for new capital is impending), and the danger that unduly low rates of distribution may reduce the market valuation of the concernbelow the real value of the assets and so facilitate take-over bids.98.   The possibilities of further action to restrain dividends appear to be:  (i) A higher rate of tax on distributed profits.(ii) Statutory limitation of dividends as was proposed in the White Paper in1951.(iii) An arrangement with the employers&apos; associations for voluntary limitationof dividends, as in the late 1940s.99. The question of a higher rate of tax on distributed profits can properly beconsidered only in the context of fiscal policy as a whole. The existing rate of taxis, however, on any reckoning very high and there would be clear dangers in pushingit further. It might have no effect at all on the amount of distributed profits, butonly on the amount available for ploughing back into the business. Alternatively,it might result merely in companies increasing prices so as to have the same netfunds available to them both for investment and distribution. Moreover, the taxtends to penalise equity capital, which has an important role to play in industrialdevelopment generally.100. It is difficult to find any economic justification for the limitation of dividends, whether under Statute or by voluntary arrangement. Indeed, there are* Provisional figure.t The figures exclude employees&apos; contributions for national insurance and for superannuation.
some positive economic disadvantages in seeking to control them. Measures of thiskind may achieve their object for a time. Thus, dividends in the years 1948 to 1950were kept stable under the arrangements made between the then Government andthe employers&apos; representatives. Immediately thereafter dividend distributionsincreased when there was a breakaway in prices and wages. The main objectionsto dividend limitation are the discouragement to expansion, investment and savingwhich there must be when rewards for investors are held down, and the impossibility of ensuring that any limitation scheme works in a reasonably equitable fashion. the artificial nature of the arrangements makes it inevitable that they should breakdown after a time, and in the interim they offer a happy hunting-ground for thespeculative take-over bid.101. Any formal scheme of dividend limitation would give rise to the most formidable practical problems. Flexible schemes for dividend limitation, that isthose allowing for some increase of dividends, have been considered in the past but have, on the whole, been thought too difficult and complex to work and likely to involve unfairness to companies whose profits or dividends were low in the selectedbase period or to be over-burdensome in the working of any system for theindependent assessment of fair distributions. Any scheme, whether statutory orotherwise, would depend for its effectiveness on the co-operation of the employers,and they would have to be persuaded that it represented equality of sacrifice ascompared with what was being done in the wages field. In this connection,employers would not be slow to take the point that in regard to wages there is noproposal for statutory control or for freezing.102. Some form of control over dividends would be economically lessdamaging than attempts to control profits as such. It might be helpful in securingtrade union co-operation if aggregate dividends were seen not to be increasing at agreater rate than wages, and if increases greater than the normal in particular cases were accompanied by explanations. Any scheme of this kind would, however,have to be worked out in agreement with the employers&apos; associations and wouldhave to be of an informal kind, leaving flexibility in particular industries. It mustbe recognised that if in practice employers took advantage of restraint in labour costs to increase profits, including distributed profits, so as to change significantlytheir share in the national income, then strong pressure would develop for theGovernment to take counter-action by increasing the rates of taxation on suchprofits.Capital Gains103. The trade unions may argue that even if dividends are restrained andany excess profit that may be made is ploughed back into the business, theadvantage of this will accrue in the end mainly to the benefit of the equity holderin the form of capital gains. It can be argued that the ploughing back of profits,however, advantage also the worker, who will benefit from the increased labour productivity which thereby becomes possible. It is, however, very doubtful whetherthis argument would satisfy the trade unions who would maintain that these capital gains are nothing more than deferred increased dividends and offer a means ofescape from dividend restraint.104. Capital gains are an inevitable feature of a society in which free dealingsin securities can take place: they are in their very nature not suitable subjects for control. The only method whereby the amount of capital gains can be reduced isthrough the taxation of such gains or through a capital levy. There appear to be nostrong economic arguments against taxing capital gains, although the majority ofthe Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income did not consider thata Capital Gains Tax would have advantages over the taxes on profits and incomes,nor did it think that realised capital gains added significantly to inflationarypressures. It seems, therefore, that any measures to tax capital gains, as such, ifthey were undertaken would be undertaken not for economic reasons or on fiscalgrounds, but for presentational and psychological reasons.
SECTION VIProcedure105. Even with goodwill all round it would take some time to make anyinnovations in wages policy effective. Some changes would take longer than others.For example the suggestion for an established norm for wage rate increases(paragraph 23 (v)) would involve radical alteration of the arbitration, &amp;c,arrangements (paragraphs 58-68) for which legislation would be required: thesuggestion for a declared rate as a guiding light (paragraph 23 (iv)) could be more quickly introduced. Any decisions which may be taken, however, can have but little relevance to the present wage round, although the outcome of that roundmay well affect tactics in regard to any proposed changes. At the earliest, any changes that may be made could affect the next round, which may begin to appear in the autumn.106. Ministers will no doubt wish to consider against this backgroundwhether any of the new policies discussed in Section II are feasible and what kindof action in regard to prices, profits and dividends (Section V) they might beprepared to contemplate to secure the co-operation of industry in any new policy.This would enable officials to develop specific proposals further.107. The adoption of any of the suggestions in Section II even the mostmodest would require consultation with industry. Once Ministers have decided in principle the line they wish to follow, one or two Ministers could have informaland confidential talks with representatives of the employers, on the basis of a document prepared for the purpose. If the prospects seemed favourable, similartalks might then be held with representatives of the T.U.C. If in the end it was thought desirable to push forward with changes, especially changes of a radicalkind, a White Paper might be needed to expose the problem and the solutions whichthe Government have in mind. Whatever policy is adopted, it might be hopedthat the Cohen Council would, through its reports, do some useful educational workin support.
APPENDIX ICALCULATION OF NON-INFLATIONARY WAGE INCREASES ANDCOMMENTARY ON OTHER ITEMS ENTERING INTO THE PRICEOF FINAL OUTPUT.Wages and Salaries1. In considering what increases in wages might be consistent with price stability, we have to rely mainly on the evidence of the post-war years. although these are abnormal in some respects, this is the only period in which we have hadexperience of consistently high levels of employment and activity.2. Total output in the United Kingdom at fixed prices, increased at a rateof about 3-2 per cent, per annum over the years 1948 to 1956. In the same period the number^ of wage and salary earners increased by 7-4 per cent., so that theincrease in output per head was, in the aggregate, 19 per cent., or 2-2 per cent,per annum. In some ways, however, the period from 1948 to 1950 might beregarded as too much affected by post-war circumstances to afford even a roughguide to the future. The picture is different, but not radically different, if one looksat a more recent period. In the five years to 1956, output rose by 14 per cent., or  - 7 per cent, per annum. As the number of wage earners rose by 4 per cent, in thisperiod, output per head rose by 9-5 per cent., or 1-8 per cent, per annum. On asimplified view of past experience, therefore, one might conclude that a rate of increase in average earnings of 1-8 per cent, to 2-2 per cent, per annum wouldbe compatible with stability in the price of final output.3. Any wages policy, however, has to be directed at wage rates or basicwages and not at earnings. Basic wages, together with hours of work, &amp;c, which affect wage costs, form the subject of the main national negotiations between theunions and employers&apos; organisations, and they are reflected in the Ministry ofLabour Index of Wage Rates. Actual earnings are affected by other matters overtime, incentive payments and the like which are not susceptible to control,even if this were desirable: and, indeed, to attempt to do so would introduce an excessive rigidity into the whole wages system. In practice, average hourlyearnings have, since 1947, shown a persistent and almost uninterrupted tendency to rise more rapidly than wage rates and basic wages. Between 1948 and 1956,the wage rate index rose 55 per cent., while average hourly earnings rose 71 percent. A full explanation of this variation wage drift is not available. A small proportion is accounted for by increased overtime and changes in the pattern ofemployment. Another factor is that piece-workers may earn more as a resultof better machines or improved methods of work while the rate for a given job(which is all the Wage Rate Index can measure) remains constant. On top of all this there is the fact that particular firms may pay higher than normal rates in competition for scarce labour. It is very much a matter of guess-work whetherthe extent of wage drift increases when increases in basic wages and rates arekept low. If, however, wage drift continued in the future at the same rate as inthe past, then the increase in wage rates which might be consistent with price stability would be between 1 - 5 per cent, and 1 - 8 per cent, per annum.4. The calculations about wage drift in paragraph 3 are inevitably tentative.Moreover they are based on the wage rates and earnings of manual wage earners,who comprise only about two-thirds of the total number of employed persons.Similar information about basic salaries and earnings of the salariat is not available.It seems likely, however, that salary drift would be less pronounced than wagedrift, if only because the employees of central and local government form a large part of those classed as salary earners, and these classes do not generally receivebonuses, &amp;c., in addition to their basic remuneration. On the other hand, thereis probably a tendency for the earnings of the salariat over a period to be adjustedin relation to the earnings of the rest of the employed population rather than by* This covers all employed persons, including members of the Armed Forces.
reference to wage rates elsewhere. In these circumstances it would not be unreasonable for present purposes to assume that a tolerable rate of increase in basic salaries would be much the same as the increase in basic wage rates calculated in paragraph 3.5. The calculations in paragraphs 1-4 are based on certain assumptions about the trend of growth in national production and in the rate of growth ofand profit on capital employed. Reality may differ from these assumptions,especially since there are fluctuations from year to year. It is necessary therefore to examine the consequences of variations in them.Assumptions about Growth of Production, &amp;c. -6. It might be argued that even an average annual increase in productionof between 2-7 per cent, and 3-2 per cent, (paragraph 2) may prove more than we can achieve consistent with a sound balance of payments. On the other hand,if the increase in production over a period of four or five years were, on average,less than this, we would be falling behind other countries, and we would have something like stagnation, which is unlikely to be acceptable as a basis of policy.Moreover, even on a very unfavourable assumption about future increases in production, wage increases based on the assumption that production would increase at a rate between 2-7 per cent, and 3-2 per cent, would be no moreinflationary than the wage increases which we have had in the light of the actualincreases in production which we have had. Then again in projecting the averageof the increase in national production over the post-war years up to 1956, thereis an assumption that production increases regularly. This is, of course, not so:in some years we have little or no increase in production, and in other years agreater than average increase. It would be reasonable to assume that, even ifthe average postulated is maintained, year to year irregularities in the patternare likely. It follows that any arrangements which were designed to link wagesor other incomes to national production would be more defensible if they were for a period of years. This might discourage people from claiming additionalincreases in the years when the going was good, for they would almost certainlyseek to avoid nil increases or reductions in years when the going was bad. Onthe other hand, profits can be expected to exercise their traditional role ofabsorbing the results of fluctuations in national output. As long as thesefluctuations are not too violent, past experience suggests that they are in factabsorbed entirely by profits. Thus, in 1952 and 1956, when output rose very littleand wages rose a great deal, there was no exceptional rise in prices. In the shortrun it seems that prices are based by industry on the expectation that their output and turnover are going to vary in a particular way: profit margins are squeezedwhen turnover rises less than expected, and are expanded when turnover risesmore. This capacity of profits for absorbing fluctuations depends, of course, onthe fact that fluctuations in national output have not been very marked, nor havereductions in output persisted for a long period.Commentary on Other Items in the Price of Final Output7. If the wages and salaries element in the price of final output is to increase at the same rate as national output, then it follows that, if prices are to be stable,the other elements which go to make up the total price of final output must not increase at a greater rate.Income from Self-employment8. Income from self-employment is a minor item (7 per cent, of the total)in the make-up of the price of total final output. It consists of the incomes of professional people (about 15 per cent.), farmers (about 24 per cent.), and soletraders and firms (about 61 per cent.). There is no reason to suppose that theseelements in the price of final output would move in such a way as themselves to disturb general price stability. Professional incomes tend to move with otherpersonal incomes and with prices, though perhaps more slowly. Aggregate farmincomes are determined largely by the level of subsidies: they have little dynamiceffect on the level of food prices which are in the main determined by the priceof imported food. Sole traders and firms (mainly distributors) tend to work onfixed percentage margins on wholesale prices.   It might be argued that the
incomes of the self-employed, however, include an element of payment for thelabour of the proprietors and are generally regarded for statistical purposes as a combination of wages and profits which it is not practicable to segregate. In any event, as explained above, they are not of great significance because of their relative size and nature.Profits9. The question is whether margins (as a percentage of cost) are liable to change (other than the short-term absorptive changes referred to in paragraph 6)and so exercise an independent influence on the course of prices. Such a changecould result from either a change in the importance of capital in the productiveprocess, or a change in the rate of profit on capital employed. Historical evidence,and data for other countries, although difficult to interpret, give no reason forexpecting any marked change in the ratio of capital to output. There are many different views on what determines the rate of profit on capital, but historicalevidence again suggests a considerable degree of long-period stability. the likelihood is, therefore, that profit margins will themselves be stable. this conclusion is consistent with the experience of the last five years, during whichthe average annual increase in company profits has been 7-5 per cent, as against an increase of 8-5 per cent, for wages and salaries in the company sector.Imports10. Though quantitatively small, this element could be so important for any policy of price stabilisation that we have considered it desirable to commentfully on it in the body of the Report (see paragraph 7).Exports11. Among the components of the index of final output price, are export prices. In so far as import costs and home costs were stable or fell, export pricesalso could be stable or perhaps even reduced. Whether or not they need to bereduced depends on the trend of world export prices and how much success weare achieving in securing our balance of payments objective. Clearly one wouldnot wish to continue to maintain stable export prices over a long period if, infact, higher prices could be charged without detriment to the balance of paymentsobjective. Over a long period it would not be possible to preserve a markedvariation between the price of goods at home and abroad, and it might over aperiod of years become necessary to allow home prices to rise rather than to face the problem of an upward valuation of the currency. This possibility, however,is not one which we need worry very much about in present circumstances.Indirect Taxes12. The remaining element in the price of final output is indirect taxes. In theordinary way, and apart from variation in the rate, the tax yield would increase at approximately the same rate as increases in national output on the assumptionthat the increased national output would be distributed proportionately among thetaxed and untaxed categories. The question as to whether the tax element in priceof final output varies is therefore substantially a question of fiscal policy. broadly speaking, a reduction of 10 per cent, in the rate of tax would reduce the price of final output by 1 per cent.Price Indices13. We have been speaking hitherto about the price of final output. This is,however, a concept unknown to the man in the street. The value of the pound, asfar as he is concerned, is measured by the Index of Retail Prices. In Parliamentarystatements, the value of the pound is measured by reference to the Consumer price index. The Retail Price Index has in recent years risen faster than either theConsumer Price Index or the Price Index of Final Output because, among other things, of the greater importance given to food prices in the Retail Price Index.Between 1948 and 1956 the Retail Price Index rose by 45 per cent., the ConsumerPrice Index by 36 per cent., and the Index of the Price of Final Output by 39 percent. There have been some special factors at work in these years to accelerate theincrease in the Index of Retail Prices e.g., the removal of subsidies and rent increases. These may now be regarded as past or passing, but even so movementof the three indices may well diverge. As far as public opinion is concerned, there
seems to be no hope of escaping from the view that the value of money will be measured by the Retail Price Index, and, indeed, this is the index which is used forcost-of-living variation clauses in wage agreements. So stability in the price of finaloutput would not necessarily mean stability in the Index of Retail Prices, and itmight be necessary for the Government to take action, e.g., fiscal action, from timeto time to help bridge the difference.Conclusions14. Our conclusions, as far as wages and salaries are concerned, are asfollows:It seems likely that increases of 2-5 per cent.&apos;per annum, as suggested by LordChandos, would be excessive. The yearly rate of increase in basic wages and salaries which might be consistent with general price stability would, on the basisof post-war experience, be between 1/5 per cent, and 1-8 per cent. Thecorresponding increase in earnings would be between 1 - 8 per cent, and 2-2 per cent,per annum. This would be, of course, an increase in real wages, for the assumptionbehind it all is that the general level of prices would be stable.The figure ultimately chosen as representing a tolerable rate of increase in basicwages and salaries cannot be predetermined on a precise arithmetical basis as above: and it would need, in any case, to be reviewed periodically in the light of experience. The initial figure could be settled only after discussions with the unions and the employers: and the amount may be affected by the average figure of increases emerging from the present wage round and by tactics in the discussions(this is discussed in paragraph 10 of the Cover Note). No doubt the unions wouldbe inclined to take a more expansive view of the future than would be justified ona mere projection of the past: but even so there ought not to be a wide range of views.On present showing a tolerable rate of increase in basic wages and salariesmight be 2 per cent, per annum. A round figure of this kind avoids an airof spurious accuracy. It might, in the event, prove excessive, but not seriously so if it were observed throughout the major part of the field. Anything less seems unlikely to secure sufficient co-operation from the unions. It is perhaps worth noting that 2 per cent, is the rate of increase which has been agreed by the central organisation of workers and employers in Sweden for the next two years. Such separately of increase would not be seriously inconsistent with the notion of doubling thestandard of living in 25 years. An increase of 2 per cent, per annum in basic wagesand salaries probably implies an increase of little less than 2-5 per cent, per annum in earnings and in output per head of the working population. On this basis,earnings and output would be doubled in about 29 years. The concept of doubling the standard of living, however, is somewhat imprecise. Earnings are only one,though an important, element. Standards of living may, for example, be increasedthrough a reduction of the proportion of the national income taken in taxation andexpended on goods and services which do not augment living standards, e.g.,defence. In any case, however, with success in the earlier part of the period, therewould be some prospects for a higher rate of increase in later years.Whatever the figure, it would have to be made clear that it was on the basis that import prices would be at least relatively stable and that the economy and living standards cannot be immunised against fluctuations in the external fortunesof the country.
APPENDIX IIWAGE SYSTEMS IN SOME OTHER countries. References are made from time to time to the possibility of a national wages policy, by which is usually meant wage-fixing machinery of the kind nowextant in the Netherlands, Sweden and Australia and of the system current inthe United States in the war and early post-war periods.The Netherlands2. Wages policy in the Netherlands is based on a measure of State controldeveloping out of the chaotic post-war situation. The wage-fixing machinery isbriefly as follows:  (a) Negotiation of a collective agreement  by workers&apos; and employers&apos;representatives for the industry in question.(b) Submission of the agreement to the Foundation of Labour for an opinion and recommendation.(c) Subsequent submission to the College of State Arbitrators for approval,which approval gives the agreement force of law, and makes illegalthe payment of wages higher or lower than the rates laid down in theagreement.3. The Foundation of Labour is a central organisation for voluntary-operation between both sides of industry, and it acts as an advisory body tothe Government on all labour and social problems. The College of StateArbitrators is comprised of six independent members appointed by theGovernment, each of whom is responsible for the oversight of one group ofindustries. In general terms, the College is required to ensure that the wagesproposed in a collective agreement are reasonable, and not likely to produceinflation or set up disturbance of the general wage levels. The College is inclose consultation with the Foundation of Labour, and is subject to guidance fromthe Government: an inspectorate enforces the decisions of the College, and thereare legal penalties for making payments other than at the rate approved by the college. There is little rigidity in the direction of the College, and specialcircumstances receive special consideration. This degree of State control of wageshas had the full support of all the workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations except the Communists, but it is understood that there is some restiveness at present onthe workers&apos; side due no doubt to the rise in prices at the end of 1956 and beginningof 1957.4. Wage control in the Netherlands is supported by price control legislation:but this is limited in its application. In return for restraint on wages, employers are said to be generally willing to keep prices steady. Manufacturers may increase prices if the Government think this is justified: if not, the Government controloperates. Occasionally the Government have intervened to prevent wholesaleprice increases being wholly passed on at the retail level: recently employers werenot permitted to pass on in the form of higher prices an increase in wages whichwas allowed to offset part of an increase in rents. There is thus some control of profits through prices, but there is apparently no control of profits as such nor of dividends.Sweden5. In Sweden wages are fixed by agreement between the trade unions and employers&apos; organisations in the main industries. But the national organisations of unions and employers have functions of co-ordination and control (including a measure of financial control) over their subordinate bodies and thus exercise a significant role.6. Each autumn, each side of industry holds a conference, at which a certainline of policy in regard to wage increases is agreed upon. Negotiations thenbogin between the employers and workers in the different industries on the basisof recommendations which have been made to each side by the autumnconferences. The industrial negotiations naturally lead to disagreement, and much
publicity and debate is given in the Press and on the radio to the issues at stake,that is, what the increase of productivity has been and is likely to be, and how the benefits should be shared. Eventually an agreement is usually concludedbetween the national organisations early in the New Year on recommendations on general issues, such as wage increases to be made to their constituents. these recommendations are generally accepted. The figure of wage increases eventuallyconceded always bears a curious resemblance to the forecasts made by informedobservers when the battle first begins in the autumn. Nothing much is gainedas a result of the negotiation and the exchange of views, except that the facts ofthe case are brought home to the people as a whole. It seems that the majorityof workers and employers are satisfied when they hear the final recommendationsof their national organisations that justice has more or less been done. In the1957 wage negotiations, the national organisations eventually arrived at a recommendation that the increase in basic wages should be 2 per cent., and thathas been accepted as the basis for settlement inside the individual industries.Agreements once made are legally enforceable in labour courts, and employersand workers may not resort to direct action during the currency of an agreement.7. The Swedish machinery seems to work reasonably smoothly andrepresents a compromise betv/een negotiations based on complete freedom for individual unions and associations and central negotiation covering all workers and employers. Concern is, however, expressed from time to time about theextent to which increases in actual earnings exceed increases in wage rates. Theoperation of the system owes much to the accepted standing of the centralorganisations, the social climate, and the close connection between the tradeunions and the Government. There is apparently no legislative control overprices except that there are agreed prices for farm products, nor is there any evidence of control of profits or dividends. It may be that price stability in sweden is helped by the intensity of competition, including international competition (tariffs are lev/), and the influence which higher prices would have on subsequent wage claims.Australia8. Wage rates in Australia depend directly or indirectly on decisions of theCommonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. There is nothing toprevent employers and trade unions from freely concluding a collective agreement on wages and other matters. Failing agreement, however, their differences mustbe referred to the Arbitration Court. References of this kind are frequent andthe bases of wages thus tend to be determined in practice by decisions of theCourt, which adjudicates on industrial disputes affecting more than one State.By virtue of court decisions extending over the past 50 years, v/age rates havebeen built up in a complex manner. There is a basic element common to all industries, and various secondary elements for conditions peculiar to individual industries, occupations, levels of skill, &amp;c. All claims for variation in wage rates are referred to the Court as disputes, whether as between individual employersand trade unions, between unions and employers on an industry-wide basis, oron a national basis. Decisions of the Court are legally enforceable, and sanctionsare provided for breaches, in particular sanctions against unions striking in defiance of awards. Apart from action arising out of specific disputes, the Courthas periodically held major enquiries into the adequacy and effect of existing wage rates. State arbitral bodies have followed the example of the CommonwealthCourt and established a method of wages fixation similar in operation and value,but these bodies are less important than the Commonwealth Court, the decisionsof which are overriding.United States9. There are not now in the United States centralised wage-fixingarrangements of the kind found in Europe. During the war, however, the UnitedStates Government set up the &quot; War Labor Board,&quot; appointed from amongprominent trade union leaders, employers and independent persons. The Boardcombined the duties of conciliator, arbitrator and general regulator of wageadjustments, and for the purpose of carrying out its duties required all changesin collective contracts to be submitted for prior approval. The prime object^ofthe Board at that time was to stabilise wages with &quot; due consideration toSECRET53075 G
inequalities and sub-standards of living.&quot; We have not thought it necessary toconsider the operations of the Board in any detail, since a great deal of itseffectiveness derived from acceptance of the fact that regulation of wages wasnecessary in time of war and since it proved impossible to carry on into peacetimethe effective and systematic regulation of wages. It is, however, noteworthy thatduring the period when the Board did operate, it refused to recognise the stateof a particular firm&apos;s or industry&apos;s profits as a justification for either high or low wages.10. There are, however, two features of the current system of wage negotiations in the United States which are worthy of note. American labourcontracts give prominence to fringe benefits of which the so-called &quot; guaranteedannual wage &quot; is notable. In addition, there is a growing practice of makingcollective agreements operate over a longer period than one year. In the lateststudy made (in 1956) of a random sample of some 900 contracts, about 56 percent, were for more than one year.  This figure was made up of:  1 to 2 years     ............... 10-52 years.................. 28-03 years.................. 14-4More than 3 years     ...      ...      ...      ... 3-055-9These contracts provide for an annual increase in real wages related to the expectedimprovement in productivity. Almost all of them contain provisions foradjustments of the rate to meet the increased cost-of-iiving as measured by thecost-of-living index there. It seems that trade unions, which were lukewarm atfirst, are now increasingly demanding more and longer-term contracts. some employers on the other hand have managed to get the period reduced on secondor third round: others have had to concede longer periods, sometimes after astrike in which the length of period has been an important issue.11. The upward trend in the number of long-term contracts has coincided with comparative price stability in the United States, but there is no evidencethat there is any connection between the two. During the period of contractno industrial disputes ought to occur, at any rate as regards wages, but muchagitation is worked up to secure increases for the next term long before the dateof review, and strikes have not infrequently occurred. It is not possible to drawany conclusions about the effect of long period contracts on industrial peacegenerally, as the total days lost through strikes vary considerably from year to year. The American system of long-term contracts is no doubt the origin ofLord Chandos&apos;s suggestion, but in their case the contracts are linked to the productivity in the particular industry, and not to the national increase in productivity.12. We have examined the question of how far the systems in the above-mentioned countries especially in Europe have contributed towards stability in prices. At the end of this Appendix we give a statement of variations in price and wage indices between 1952 and 1956 in Sweden, Holland and Australia, inso far as these are available. We have selected this period so as to exclude theimmediate post-war years and the unsettled period of the Korean War, but thegeneral picture, even if one goes back to 1948, is not radically different.13. It must be said at once that in none of the three countries has the valueof money been stabilised for any prolonged period. Between 1952 and 1956,consumer prices rose by 9 per cent, in the Netherlands and 11 per cent, in sweden and earnings* in manufacturing by 22 per cent.* and 20 per cent. In Australia,the increases were 15 per cent, and 26 per cent. The experience of the netherlands and Sweden has, nevertheless, been better than that of the United Kingdom: overthe same period, consumer prices here rose by 15 per cent, and earnings by31 per cent. The range was equally wide for wage-costs in manufacturing, which remained virtually stable in the Netherlands, rose by 6 per cent, in Sweden andby 14 per cent, in the United Kingdom.* In the case of the Netherlands, the 22 per cent, increase is in rates: the corresponding increasein wage rates in the United Kingdom would be 24 per cent. It is believed, however, that increases in earnings in Holland do not differ radically from increases in rates perhaps in part because paymentat rates in excess of those prescribed are illegal.
14. Such comparisons cannot themselves demonstrate that it is the differentinstitutional arrangements for determining wages which have caused the recordto be better in the other countries. The factors which influence wages and prices are many and complex, and there have certainly been other differences in thecircumstances of the different countries which have influenced the outcome.There is, nevertheless, perhaps some presumption that the institutions have helped.This presumption is strengthened by the particular experience of the Netherlandsduring and after the Korean boom. When the boom began, general agreement was reached that wage policy should be framed explicitly to lower real wages byas much as 5 per cent. Real wages, in fact, fell considerably below the 1948 leveland it was not until 1954 that they were restored to that level. Such an example of self-discipline is difficult to parallel anywhere.15. Perhaps the most remarkable difference between these countries andthe United Kingdom lies, however, in the degree of public understanding of theprice problem. In the Netherlands and Sweden, it is generally recognised (by trade unions as well as others) as fundamentally a wage problem and as onerequiring Government or centralised action. While it may be argued that thisgreater degree of sophistication is the cause rather than the effect of the difference in institutions, it is difficult to believe that the relation is not reciprocal.Summary16. All the systems above, apart from the United States, have characteristicswhich are fundamentally different from free collective bargaining as it has grownup in this country. The Netherlands system is, in substance, a determination bythe State, through the College of Arbitrators, of wage increases: the majorconsiderations are the effect on wage levels as a whole and on the economy. TheSwedish system depends significantly on the accepted control of the NationalTrade Union Federation and the National Employers&apos; Association over theirconstituent members. In the case of Australia, wage rates are fixed substantiallyby the State through the Court.
