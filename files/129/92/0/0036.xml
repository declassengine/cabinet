ANNEX ADRAFT COMMUNICATION TO THE GREEK AND TURKISHGOVERNMENTSHer Majesty&apos;s Government have all along sought a solution of the cyprus problem which could be accepted by the three Governments concerned as wellas by both Cypriot communities. None of the solutions so far put forward hasin fact proved acceptable to all three Governments, because of the incompatibilityof certain of their present demands. It is therefore clear that it will be necessary,if any solution is to be reached, for each Government to make some sacrifice of its present position. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to set an exampleby renouncing their sole sovereignty over Cyprus, if the Greek and turkish governments will match this sacrifice by renouncing their respective demands for unitary self-determination and the partition of the Island.2. These three major sacrifices would open the way for an imaginative and quite new solution, designed to suit the altogether peculiar circumstances of cyprus, viz., a scheme for sharing the Island&apos;s sovereignty between the three governments in a triple Anglo-Greco-Turkish condominium, as a form ofpartnership within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). It would cover the whole Island except for certain small military enclaves which, in thecommon defence interest, would be retained under sole British sovereignty.3. The details of the scheme would have to be carefully worked out betweenthe three Governments. Briefly, it is suggested that they should be on thefollowing lines:  (a) The Cypriots should be given the opportunity of acquiring Greek orTurkish nationality in addition to their present British nationality.(b) A Governor of Cyprus should be appointed jointly by the three co-domini,to whom he would be responsible for the discharge of all his functions.His selection (as opposed to his appointment) might be left, if theco-domini failed to agree, to the members of NATO other than theco-domini.(c) The Governor would administer the Island under a new constitution which would provide for him to be advised by elected Ministers, andfor the full protection of the rights of the Turkish Cypriot community.(d) The three co-domini would have representatives, resident in Cyprus, withthe right of direct access to the Governor; these representatives would act as the channel of communication between the Governor and theco-domini.(e) The normal machinery for consultation between the co-domini would bea three-Power Council, meeting at regular intervals in each of the threecapitals in rotation.(/) There would be three reserved functions which would not come within the purview of the elected Ministers :  (i) External relations would be handled by the co-domini, or delegated to the Governor acting in consultation with the representativesof the co-domini.(ii) External defence might perhaps most conveniently be entrusted tothe United Kingdom alone, or alternatively might be made aNATO responsibility if the members of NATO were willing toinclude the Island within the NATO area.(iii) Internal security would be the responsibility of the Governor,acting in consultation with the representatives of the co-dominiand on instructions from the co-domini; if in any circumstances he were unable to obtain unanimous instructions, he would have authority to take essential decisions on his own; he would be assisted by a joint police force and also by a military forcecomposed of equal contingents of British, Greek and turkish troops.(g) Other details, e.g., economic arrangements, would have to be settled byagreement between the three Governments.
ANNEX BSTUDY OF THE CONCEPT OF TRI-DOMINIUMThe following are our detailed comments on the proposals outlined inparagraph 3 of Annex A.2.   Nationality (paragraph 3 (a) of Annex A)The tri-dominium treaty could lay down that any Cypriot would be entitledto apply for Greek or Turkish nationality in addition to his present british nationality. The Greek and Turkish Governments would presumably have tohave the right to reject unsuitable applications; in these cases, or, where no application was made, British nationality would be retained alone. It would be undesirable automatically to impose a second nationality on anyone, or to allow any Cypriot to held both Turkish and Greek nationality. A Cypriot obtainingGreek or Turkish nationality would no doubt be entitled to resign his british nationality if he wished. The condominium precedents are not helpful. natives of the New Hebrides (Anglo-French condominium) have no nationality. natives of the Sudan during the Anglo-Egyptian condominium held neither British norEgyptian nationality but had the &quot;status &quot; (not nationality) of Sudanese citizens;they travelled abroad on Sudanese passports issued in the Governor-General&apos;s Name, and they were entitled at will to either British or Egyptian consular protection.3.   The Governor (paragraph 3 (b) of Annex A)There is no reason why the Governor should not be a national of one of thetri-dominium Powers if one acceptable to all three Powers can be found. Inpractice he would almost certainly have to be a national of some other country,533534. Her Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly commend this plan to the Turkish/Greek Government, as representing what may well be the last chance of securing an agreed solution to a problem which has too long bedevilled relations between three allied and friendly countries and has led to unrest and bloodshed in the Islanditself.The above communication might well at the same stage be published. Thefollowing points, not for publication, might be made orally when the communicationis delivered:  [To the Turkish Government only]Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that, from the point of view of theTurkish Government, this plan will confer all the essential advantages whichwould have been available under partition without incurring any of partition^practical drawbacks. It will safeguard the Turkish Governments two principle interests: the welfare of the Turkish Cypriots and the security of theTurkish mainland. In an Island under partial Turkish sovereignty it will never be possible either to persecute the Turkish minority or to mount militaryoperations against Turkey. The danger of the administration of the Islandfalling under Communist domination would be removed. The TurkishGovernment will have the stake in the Island&apos;s future to which they have all along attached the greatest importance.[To the Greek Government only]Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that, from the point of view of theGreek Government, this plan represents much the best solution, given thatEnosis is unobtainable. The only practicable alternatives are probably eitherpartition or the grant to Turkey of a military enclave so large as to amount ineffect to partition; the present plan should be far more acceptable to Greekopinion that either of these. The plan will give the Greeks an equal share inthe Island&apos;s Government. It will remove any danger of the Turks resorting to violence. It will enable those Greek Cypriots who wish to become Greeknationals to do so while retaining certain economic and practical advantages of British nationality. It will enable the Greek flag to fly in Cyprus asa symbolic fulfilment of the Greek Cypriots&apos; national aspirations.
preferably a NATO country. It seems essential that the Governor should have some power to act on his own discretion in cases where the co-domini cannot agree on his instructions. Such circumstances would be most likely to arise inconnection with the maintenance of internal security. There would have to be careful definition in advance of the extent of this power, the circumstances inwhich it could be called into operation and the length of time for which it couldbe exercised in each case. These problems would fall to be negotiated betweenthe three co-domini in consultation with the Governor designate at the timeof the drawing up of the Constitution. The power would presumably be confined to real emergencies. Any wider power could involve a risk of one or more ofthe co-domini losing confidence in the Governor, if indeed it did not render thewhole plan totally unacceptable to the Greeks in the first place. By contrast theGovernor-General of the Sudan had absolute power to govern as he chose in all matters, subject only to the right of the co-domini to dismiss him.4.   The Constitution (paragraph 3 (c) of Annex A)Officials first reported on this subject in Appendix C of C. (57) 178. It was assumed last year that the Radcliffe proposals would form the basis of theConstitution, under tri-dominium. The Governor has since commented that the radcliffe plan was designed for a regime of undivided British sovereignty andwould have to be radically altered to fit tri-dominium; he adds that anythingreminiscent of the Radcliffe Constitution would be opposed by the Turkish Cypriotsat least as vigorously as by the Greek Cypriots. The Governor has accordinglyput forward ar alternative constitutional plan which differs from the Radcliffe pfanin providing for a separate Assembly for each of the two communities, whereasLord Radcliffe provided only for a single Assembly. Since the beginning of thisyear, the Turkish Government have insisted, as part of their propaganda forpartition, that the two communities can no longer live together; this argumentshould certainly incline the Turks to oppose a Radchffe-type constitution even ifpresented as part of a tri-dominium plan. But the other aspects of tri-dominiumare distinctly more acceptable to the Turks than to the Greeks, and the Governorssuggestion for separate communal Assemblies might be regarded by the Greeks asfavouring ultimate partition. Given that the main difficulty about tri-dominiumwould be securing Greek agreement, it would therefore seem better to retain the radcliffe concept of a single Assembly, which the Greeks would presumably prefer.If the problem of further adapting the Radcliffe constitution to tri-dominium is tobe pursued there would be advantage in consulting Lord Radcliffe himself. for purely presentational purposes, however, it would be as well to avoid publiclymentioning Lord Radcliffe&quot;s name in connection with any constitution proposed under tri-dominium.5.   The Representatives of the Co-domini (paragraph 3 (d) of Annex A)In theory, these representatives would no doubt be entitled to offer advice tothe Governor on all subjects, since he would have an overall responsibility to theco-domini for the discharge of all his functions. In practice, however, therepresentatives would only need to advise him on either his reserved powers ormatters relating to the Turkish community; in other fields, he would presumablybe obliged by the Constitution to act on the advice of his elected Ministers withwhich there would be no cause for the representatives of the co-domini to quarrel.As regards matters relating to the Turkish community, it might be possible toarrange for the representatives of the co-domini to have the right to suspendenactment of any legislation on the grounds of its being discriminatory, subject tothe final decision resting with the Governor. But it seems preferable to use thedevice of an internal Tribunal of Guarantees, as proposed by Lord Radcliffe, inorder to avoid discrimination; and to make necessary the consent of two-thirds ofthe Turkish Cypriot members of the Assembly to any legislation affecting theircommunity.6.   The Three-Power Council (paragraph 3 (e) of Annex A)The purpose of this would be to formalise relations between the three Powerson duatters relating to Cyprus and to provide a regular forum in which their viewson the subject could be exchanged. Otherwise, there would be a danger of Cyprusproblems dominating and damaging the normal relations of the three Powers with each other.
7.   External Affairs (paragraph 3 (/) (i) of Annex A)There would of course be no question of any foreign representation for the cyprus Government. Equally, Cyprus would not belong to any major international organisation, although it might be necessary for her to have at least some associaterelationship with certain technical organisations, e.g., the International Postal Union.8.   External Defence (paragraph 3 (/) (ii) of Annex A)Since the system of military enclaves remaining under full British sovereigntyis an integral part of the plan, it follows that we should have to retain within ourenclaves all the military facilities necessary for defending them. This alone is astrong reason for the United Kingdom accepting responsibility for external defence on behalf of and with the agreement of the other two co-domini. If, however, thisshould not prove acceptable to the Greeks or the Turks another possible, but lessdesirable, solution would be to invite al! the members of NATO to agree to thejuridical extension of the NATO area to include Cyprus. This might lead to NATOasking for facilities, either within or outside our enclaves. In the former case thematter would be one for agreement between ourselves and NATO; in the latter itwould be for agreement between NATO and the three sovereign Powers. Thearguments for sole British responsibility or for NATO responsibility are set forth in the Appendix to C. (57) 184.9.   Internal Security (paragraph 3 (/) (iii) of Annex A)The Governors powers in an emergency have been considered in paragraph above. The nature of the internal security force at his disposal was considered inparagraph 11 (b) of Appendix C to C. (57) 178.The internal security force would be composed of equal contingents of British,Greek and Turkish troops and would be under a single command. The commanding officer would be appointed by, and responsible to, the Governor. He would be selected by the three co-domini or, failing agreement between them, by NATO.It would be possible to assess the total size of force required only when a fairlyclear picture of the internal security situation likely to follow the introduction oftri-dominium can be formed. Against the assumption of a settled political situation under British sovereignty, the long-term Army order of battle approved by theChiefs of Staff provided for three battalions to meet internal security requirements in Cyprus. If following tri-dominium this requirement were considered to be adequate, the force could consist of one battalion from each of the three co-domini.10.   Other Details (paragraph 3 (g) of Annex A)The economic implications of tri-dominium are fully set out in C. (57) 275.11. The draft communication makes no mention of three possibilities whichwe have at various times considered :  (a) The suggestion of limiting the period of tri-dominium to, e.g., twenty years,at the end of which the whole position would be reviewed. In theory,this might make the whole plan more attractive to the Greeks who couldclaim that they had not finally abandoned their demand for self-determination. But in practice, once the Turkish Government had beengranted a stake in the Island it would never be possible to get them out;and the Greeks could not fail to realise this. Indeed, a review clausemight well serve only to increase Greek fears that tri-dominium was no more than a first step to partition. The Turks, for their part, wouldprobably dislike a review clause as providing an opening for continuedagitation by the Greek Cypriots. A limited tri-dominium, in fact, wouldbe less stable than a permanent one without having any more realattraction for any of the Parties.(b) The question of granting the Turkish and/or Greek Governments separatemilitary bases in the island as distinct from the integrated military facilities available to them under the main tri-dominium plan. Aseparate Turkish base would certainly appeal to the TurkishGovernment. But it would be the Greeks and not the Turks whowould constitute the main obstacle to the acceptance of tri-dominium;and the Greeks would neither want a base of their own nor be able toaccept the idea of a Turkish base in addition to a Turkish share in the island&apos;s sovereignty.
(c) The idea of associating the United States and possibly another Power withthe co-domini, both as guarantors of the tri-dominium treaty and inorder to constitute a final court of appeal to settle disputes between theco-domini. Some machinery for settling disputes would obviously bedesirable. But there is little evidence to suggest that the americans would be willing permanently to involve themselves to this extent in the cyprus problem or to accept the potential unpopularity which the role of arbitrator would inevitably carry with it. In any case, anarrangement involving the United States would probably be unpalatableto the Greeks as representing further foreign intervention in what they regard as an essentially Greek problem..12.   Presentation(a) Even apart from any proposal for their formal involvement in a tri-dominium treaty, the United States Government should be consulted about the tri-dominium plan before it is put to the Greeks or Turks.They took an adverse view of tri-dominium when it was outlined tothem last autumn, on the grounds that it would be totally unacceptable to the Greeks and therefore unworkable.(b) It would be important to present the tri-dominium plan to the GreekGovernment and to obtain their reaction before any approach is madeto the Turks. We have suffered too much in the past from making proposals to the Turks which were subsequently rejected by the Greeksbut to which the Turks continued to regard us as committed.13. In conclusion, it must be recognised that tri-dominium cannot be imposed.It would require not only the acquiescence but also the positive co-operation of boththe Greek and Turkish Governments for its continued working.April 1958.
