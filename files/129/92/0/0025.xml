in(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BPJ.TMNIC MAJESTY^ GOVEHNT/IENT)C.(58) 75 COPY HO. O ]2nd April, 1953CABINETLOCAL LNPJJPLCTxl/IENTMemorandum by the Chancellor^of the Ejccjie^uerThe attached table lists the places in which registeredunemployment at 17th February was 5 per cent or more.   The average for Great Britain at that date was 1.9 per cent.2. This is a continuously changing picture, but at thattime the distribution v/as. rather striking.   Apart from holidayresorts, where high unemployment is normal in the winter,   the rev/as hardly anyvhere in England which could reasonably he described as a serious pocket of high local unemployment;    in Wales, therewas West South Wales, spreading to Milford Haven and Pembroke Dock,and some parts of North Wales;   in Scotland, Greenock, Linlithgow,Dundee and the Highlands Development Area are in the list, togetherwith many places at the extremities of the country.3. It is noteworthy that the existing Development areas are not a reliable guide to the location of the &quot;soft spots&quot;.l+o The position in Northern Ireland is clearly of adifferent class of intensity to that in virtually any part ofGreat Britain;    there may well be more unemployment in NorthernIreland than in all the &quot;soft spots&quot; in Great Britain put together.5. No doubt in the last month, the position in the holidayresorts has improved, and no doubt other &quot;soft spots&quot; have developed and many apprehensions relate to the future and not to the present.6. But it docs look as if the real social problem is likelyto be a narrow one.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.2nd April, 1958
