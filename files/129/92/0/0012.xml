SECRETfHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC iMAJESTY&apos;8 GOV E-RNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1958C. (58) 62 Copy No.24th March, 1958CABINETWAGES POLICY: NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of health the National Health Service Administrative and Clerical Whitley council have been negotiating pay scales to fit the new grading structure recommended bySir Noel Hall. The negotiations began with the general grades (present salariesranging from  206 per annum to  1,092 per annum) and for these grades agreement has been reached on scales, with the exception of the upper part of the scale forthe basic clerical grade. This issue may still be a breaking point, but the staff side have agreed to continue discussions on other questions which affect these general grades. If we wish negotiations to continue we must, as a next step, tableproposals for putting the existing staff into the new pay and grading structure.This raises difficult issues.2. The existing structure contains nine grades which, under the new scheme,will be reduced to four. The first step is therefore to settle which of the existinggrades are to be compared with each of the proposed new ones. We have assumed that staff in an existing grade would be put on assimilation into the lowest of theproposed new grades into which they could reasonably be assimilated. But it islikely that in due course, after the immediate assimilation, there will be a regradingof a number of the posts.3. Having determined into which new grades the existing staff will be put,we still have to decide in what way the pay scale of the new grade is to be appliedto them. The new scales represent a substantial increase over the existing scales;the minimum salary goes up by just over 10 per cent, and the highest salary inthe general grades by over 20 per cent. I believe that in present circumstances it would be impossible to give an immediate increase in pay of the order of10 per cent, or more, which would be the result of applying something like thenormal corresponding points method of assimilation, without repercussions onthe Governments general wages policy. I therefore propose that the initialassimilation arrangements should give substantially less than this.4. It is desirable that any assimilation arrangements should be reasonablysimple: that the existing staff should be placed either on a point in the proposed new scales or in some defined relationship to them, so that we can be seen to bebringing the new structure into effect; and that the proposed arrangements shouldbe reasonably fair and defensible. In addition, I believe that, having regard to thehistory of their pay claims, any scheme which gives less than an immediate3 per cent, increase to the staff at this level would be completely unacceptable tothe Staff Side. The assimilation proposals in scheme A, as set out in detail inthe annex to this memorandum, are in my view a reasonable method of meetingthese requirements.5. The basic feature of scheme A is that the staff are assimilated to a pointon the new pay scales or to a point on a short notional scale which is an extensionor modification of the lower part of the scale. These points have been deliberately53193b
chosen so as to limit the amount of increase that will be received on assimilation.Existing staff going into the proposed new grades would get on to the new scaleswithin five years. In the interim period there would with the exception explained in paragraph 6 be only one transitional scale of pay for each new grade. (Thisis not the case with scheme B.). 6. A special arrangement is proposed for existing staff in grade B. sinceon any ordinary basis the staff in this grade should receive no increment at allon assimilation. They were however within the Whitley recommendation for a3 per cent, increase. It is, therefore, proposed that they should receive animmediate 3 per cent, increase but that their next increment should be correspondingly reduced to a few pounds so that they would not achieve a higherposition on the new scale than would be justified on an age basis.7. Under scheme A, the amount of increase in pay received by existing members of the staff on assimilation would vary, some individuals getting less than3 per cent, and some more, but the average would be of the order of 3 - 7 per cent.I believe that an increase of this order could be defended on the grounds that thisis a revaluation designed to improve the staffing structure and to bring the pay ofhealth service employees into a fairer relationship with the pay of correspondingemployments elsewhere so as to improve the quality of recruitment. Indeed, in my view it is essential that this re-grading operation should be treated as somethingcompletely different from a cost-of-living claim.8. If it were considered essential that no category of staff should receive morethan 3 per cent, increase in pay on assimilation, I believe that the best wayof achieving this would be by scheme B (see annex). Under this scheme, each member of the existing staff would receive an increase of pay precisely equal to3 per cent. His resulting salary would not then coincide with one of the new scalepoints. Thereafter he would receive annual increments relating to the incrementalpattern under the new scales but his salary would not correspond to the scale until he reached the maximum of his new grade. Under this arrangement there would beno less than 28 scales of pay in existence for the clerical grade alone and the workof the 600 separate hospital and Executive Council pay sections would become very complicated. Moreover, except for new staff, it would take many years before theproposed new pay structure could be said to be in effect, since the majority of employees would not be paid at scale rates and only the incremental pattern andthe ultimate maximum of the grade would be applicable to them. Some staff would still be off the scales under this arrangement in fifteen years&apos; time. It would bedifficult to describe such an arrangement as assimilation in the sense in which thisterm is normally understood.9. Scheme B can be justified only if it is considered that the need to avoid anincrease of pay at any point of more than 3 per cent, overrides all other considerations. Moreover, even though the designated grades (broadly speaking,those over  1,200) are not dealt with in this memorandum, one cannot overlook theeffect which scheme B would have when we later have to deal with them. Anincrease of precisely 3 per cent, on assimilation for the general grades (i.e., those under  1,200) obviously calls to mind the Whitley agreement of last October wherestaff under  1,200 received a 3 per cent, increase which was disapproved for thetime being and staff over  1,200 received a 5 per cent, increase which was approved.If the implication is that the general grades should receive nothing more onassimilation than the increase they would have received last October but for the withholding of approval then it seems to follow that the designated grades wouldbe entitled to no increase because they received one of 5 per cent, last autumn. Butthe hospital employing authorities consider that there is an exceedingly strong case for paying the designated grades much higher salaries than they receive at presentand the new scales themselves are likely to be substantially higher than the old. Itwould be most difficult to justify committing ourselves now to arrangements forthe general grades based on principles which, when applied to the designatedgrades, would mean that existing staff would be affected by the new scales onlyin so far as they had higher maxima. I consider, therefore, that it is most desirablethat a scheme on the lines of scheme A should be adopted in order that the actualamount of increase should not appear to be limited to movements in the cOst-of-living index.
Ministry of Health, W. 1,21st March, 1958.5319310. On either basis, the proposed amount of pay increase on assimilation is substantially less than the Staff Side might have a right to expect having regard to normal assimilation procedures in the Civil Service and elsewhere. In particular,where pay is linked to age, staff would not be assimilated to the correspondingage point on the new scales. We should not therefore wish to close the door finallyon the possibility of a further instalment of assimilation increase at some later date when economic circumstances have improved. Clearly, no promises can be madebut we think it would be helpful to indicate that such a step is not necessarily ruled out.11. When the negotiations reach their final stages, if there is no breakbeforehand, it will be necessary to agree a date from which implementation should start. It is reasonable to offer a slight measure of retrospection since these negotiations have been going on for quite a long time. On the assumption that agreement could be reached not later than end April or early May, I would recommend 1st March as the date of implementation.12. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to the adoption of scheme A with effect from 1st March.13. The Secretary of State for Scotland agrees with this paper and with therecommendation in favour of the adoption of scheme A.. sD. W-S.
AnnexADMINISTRATIVE AND CLERICAL STAFF ASSIMILATION TO NEWGENERAL GRADESThe attached tables illustrate two alternative schemes of assimilation. Bothare deliberately designed to keep the actual increase in pay received by existing staff to the order of 3 per cent.2. Staff other than those in Grade B would be assimilated from points in theirpresent scales to points on the new scales which would give them an increase of asnear as possible to 3 per cent, (but in no case less than 2 per cent.). The new scaleshave been extended downwards in order to avoid higher percentage increases atthe minima.On assimilation to actual or &quot; notional &quot; points on the new scales, staff will proceed to the maximum by normal annual increments.Grade B staff would be given a straight 3 per cent, increase (rounded to the nearest  5) and at their next annual incremental date they would proceed to thenext highest point on the new scale. Thereafter they would go up the scale in thenormal way.The average percentage salary increases under scheme A would be:  The &quot; weighted &quot; average percentage increase for all grades throughout the health Service would be 3 - 7.3. All grades would be given a straight 3 per cent, increase on assimilation,and would thereby be put on off-scale points. The figures shown in the tables under scheme B do not represent incremental progressions up the scales, but merely the salary figures which would be produced after a 3 per cent, increase on each existingscale point.If this scheme were adopted, staff would remain on off-scale points until they reached their maximum. (Their yearly increments would be of the amountappropriate to the nearest incremental point.)The percentage increase under scheme B would be exactly 3 for all the gradesand at every point in them.Scheme AGrade Al-5-0Grade B -3 0Grade D -4-3Grade F -3-9Grade A2 3-4Grade C -4-4Grade E -4-0Grade G  4-8Senior Administrative Officer 3-9Scheme B
