secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1958C. (58) 98 Copy No.9th May, 1958CABINETFARM  prices memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food on 11th March the Cabinet agreed to include in the White Paper on the annual review of farm prices an indication that the Government had taken the initiative in formulating proposals to assist the small farmer (C.C. (58) 22nd Conclusions).Proposals have now been prepared. These have been considered by the ministerial Committee on Farm Price Review and the Chancellor of the exchequer has asked me to report to the Cabinet. I seek authority to put these proposals to the Farmers&apos; Unions.General Nature of proposals.   The proposals are in two parts:  (i) A Small Farmer SchemeThis is quite new. It is to help those with small farm businessesthat are fundamentally sound economic propositions. Applicantswould be required to submit comprehensive proposals for improving the economy of their farm businesses over a three to five-year period.Special grants, amounting on average to about  175 a year over fouryears, would be payable on the carrying out of the approvedimprovement proposals.(ii) A Supplementary SchemeThis is intended to be a temporary scheme.(a) instead of the existing marginal production schemes (which expirein August, but should be continued until the new scheme starts),to assist those whose businesses are not large enough to beviable in the foreseeable future;(b) to provide stop-gap assistance for small farmers with viable farmbusinesses for whom a comprehensive improvement programme is not yet practicable e.g., because they are not ready or because it is not possible to handle their applications for the time being.Assistance under this scheme would be given by specially high ratesof grant under the ploughing, lime, fertiliser and ditching subsidies inEngland and Wales and in Northern Ireland and by cropping grants in Scotland.3. It is estimated that there would be in the United Kingdom some 130,000small farm businesses eligible for assistance under these proposals, or roughlyone-third of all farmers. About 90,000 would be eligible for the small farmerscheme and 40,000 for supplementary assistance only. It is estimated that after a preliminary sorting out perhaps 30,000 of those eligible for the small farmer53426
scheme would be found ready to undertake acceptable comprehensive improvementprogrammes during the first year of the new scheme. The other 60,000 in this group (together with the 40,000 eligible for supplementary assistance only) wouldhe eligible for supplementary assistance instead for the time being. The best ofthese would come forward with comprehensive improvement proposals in thesecond and third years.Financial Cost4.   The probable cost of the new grants is:  :Small farmer scheme. About  5 to  6 millions in a full year once the scheme has got going;Supplementary scheme. About  44- millions a year (in place of about  3millions on the present marginal production schemes).5. Direct credit would be taken in the 1959 Annual Review determinationsfor  64 to  74- millions, comprising  5 to  6 millions for the small farmer schemeand the  14 millions additional expenditure under the supplementary scheme ascompared with the existing marginal production schemes. The intention is thatthis would be offset by reductions in the level of the price guarantees, so as notto add to Exchequer liability.6. The new grants would encourage more ploughing up of grassland and greater use of fertilisers and lime. This is necessary if the small farms are to bemade more economic. But it means additional expenditure, estimated at some 5 millions a year, under existing production grants. This kind of change in expenditure, sometimes up and sometimes down, arising out of greater or lesseruse of a production grant as opposed to a change in the rate of grant, is not eligible,on existing conventions, to be taken directly into account at the Annual Review.On the other hand, this new burden on the Exchequer could well be offset by reducing the price guarantees by more than the value of the new grants. this could be defended because the new grants would make it less necessary to help the small farmer through high prices for milk, pigs and eggs.Effect on Production7. The help given may lead some small farmers to increase their output ofthese products. But as a group those within the new scheme produce no morethan 15 per cent, of total output of milk, pigs or eggs. In any case, the new grantswould be counterbalanced by reductions in the guarantees and this should lead toa squeezing out of the highest cost production on all types of farms, but especially on the larger farms. The new grants would also encourage the smaller farmers to make greater use of grass and other home-grown feed, and so increaseprofitability without increasing the output of end products.Advantages and Disadvantages of the proposals.   The main drawbacks are:  (i) The additional expenditure on existing production grants which isnecessary if these small farmers are to be got on to the right lines.(ii) The need to help temporarily many small businesses that are not evenpotentially viable farming units; but this would be reviewed in threeyears&apos; time.(iii) The fact that, except in Northern Ireland, the proposals would be unpopular with the Farmers&apos; Unions and with many individual farmers,especially the larger ones; this was always to be expected.(iv) The strain on staff resources, which may mean a slower start than wewould wish and some arrangement for limiting the number of applications in the early stages; this will have to be assessed more closelywhen we have discussed with the Farmers&apos; Unions.9.   The main advantages are:  (i) The present system of guarantees tends to favour financially the largerfarmer.   These proposals will go some way to redress the balance.
(ii) Many small farmers would be put on a sound basis over a relatively short period as a result of redistributing less than 5 per cent, of total subsidies.(iii) More of our financial and technical resources will be devoted to the smallerfarmers most in need of them.(iv) A major Farmers&apos; Union talking point at Annual Reviews will be met andthis will improve the prospect of getting down the general level of the guarantees, and particularly the guarantees for milk, pigs and eggs.Long-Term Prospects10. The new schemes should help to make production generally more economic, by lowering costs on the smaller farms and by making it easier to influenceproduction in the right directions by reducing the guarantees on products in amplesupply.11. Many individual businesses will be put on a sound footing and no specialnew measures should be necessary to keep them there or to prevent them fromdisintegrating later. On the other hand, those applicants whose resources are too small to enable them ever to earn a sufficient livelihood will have been identified,this should create a greater readiness on their part to make way for better farms tobe created or for better farmers to take over and to accept policies for the encouragement of such developments, e.g., by further assistance towardsamalgamations.Conclusion12. 1 am sure these proposals are on the right lines, though there are boundto be problems of administration and presentation. They are acceptable lo theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland and I invite the Cabinetto authorise us to put the proposals to the Farmers&apos; Unions.J. H.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,8th May, 1958.
