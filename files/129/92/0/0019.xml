COPY NO. S (oCA3T.NETLOCAL, UNEMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have discussed the problem oflocal unemployment, on which public and Parliamentary attention isbeing increasingly focussed (E.A.(58) 7th Meeting, Item 2).   The currenttendency is for the general sleekening of demand for man-power to showup more sharply, not in the country at large, but in those areas where unemployment has for long been substantially higher than the national level.   Attention thus tends to be concentrated on the disparity betweenthe general unemployment level and that in these particular places.2.        The Committee feel that we must take all the action wereasonably can to deal with this problem;  and, equally important, wemust be seen to be doing so.   Otherwise,,we shall come under increasing pressure to take premature action in the direction of general &quot;reflation&quot;and re-expansion, which would lose us the benefits which our present policies of restraint and restriction are winning for us.   Such action might well lead to renewed inflation and would undermine sterling both at home and abroad, with consequences which could be far more serious than any we have suffered hitherto.3.        This problem of local unemployment - the so-called &quot;soft spots&quot; -is in any event only very partially bound up with employment levels as awhole.   There is little reason to think that general measures to stimulateemployment would have even a proportionate effect on it.   The slighteasing of over-full employment in recent months has somewhat intensifiedit;  there is, however, no reason to believe that a return to previous generalemployment levels would solve it.4.        Generally speaking, these pockets of unemployment are caused bya decline in individual industries arising from inevitable changes in demandbased often on technological progress.   Where this is so there are only-two kinds of solution possible:-(a) bringing new work to the localities;(b) facilitating transfers of population.There are severe limits on what can be done (save over a long period)under the second of these heads.   We should nevertheless pursue both.-1-C.(58) 6928th March, 1950j(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5.        The problem at issue here concerns only areas of presentunemployment (some of which are within the development areas and someoutside) and not the development areas as such.   It is indeed only in thecase of Scotland that the present development area is almost entirely a&quot;soft spot&quot;.   Much of the rest of the development areas are nowprosperous, though there are small &quot;soft spots&quot; contained within them.Where the present areas of local unemployment are contained in or(in the case of Scotland) comprise an existing development area, theBoard of Trade and other Departments already have powers to takeremedial action.6.        How best can we take action to assist those &quot;soft spots&quot; whichare outside the present development areas?   The Committee consider thatany action should not be based on extending the schedule of development areas.   Experience has shown the harmful rigidity of the schedulingprocess, since we seem unable to de-schedule an area, once scheduled,however completely the problem of unemployment in it may be solved(the only practicable method of cie-scheduling appears to be by admini-strative action, i. e. spending no money on new factories in those areas,or parts of areas, which we judge to be no longer in special need).Moreover, many of the existing powers are inappropriate to most of thesmall and scattered &quot;soft spots&quot;.7.        It is the view of the Committee that an effective solution to theproblem might lie in the Government taking new powers to give financialassistance to industrial undertakings in respect of places outside thedevelopment areas.   This assistance could take the form of loans made inaccordance with recommendations of an advisory committee, onpreferential terms to companies undertaking new projects, or extensions to existing projects, in cases where the Government was satisfied thatsuch lc:.tn8 would help to provide employment in places where substantialunemployment both existed and was likely to continue.   It would probablybe both impracticable and undesirable to attempt to fetter these powers by too close a definition either of the areas or of the projects which wouldbe eligible for assistance of this sort.8.        Such a scheme would not cover Northern Ireland which already hasspecial arrangements of its own administered by its own Government forattracting new industries.   We should have to consider whether or not thescheme should operate in &quot;soft spots&quot; within, as well as outside,existing development areas.   We already have similar powers (not nowbeing actively used) which apply to the development areas.   If the newpowers were to be limited in operation to places outside the development areas, we should have to be prepared to exercise the existing powers in&quot;soft spots&quot; inside those areas.   It seems likely that it might beinconvenient, and confusing, to have parallel powers in operation indifferent parts of the country.   For this reason we might well conclude that the new powers suggested in this paper should be available throughout great Britain, though of course they would be used only where theemployment situation justified it.-2-
9.        The Committee recognise that a proposal on these lines wouldrequire legislation, and that the legislative programme for the rest of thecurrent session is already very congested.   But the Bill should be short and relatively uncontroversial;  and if the Government are to retain theinitiative a very early announcement of our intentions should be made,the introduction of the Bill following shortly thereafter.10.      I should be glad to know if the Cabinet share the view of theEconomic Policy Committee that action on the lines sketched out inparagraph 7 above should be set in hand.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.28th March, 1953-3-se.....:ret
