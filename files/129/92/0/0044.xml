secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1958C. (58) 94 Copy No.2nd May, 1958CABINETAIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 1st August, 1957, the Cabinet invited my predecessor to arrange for an informal enquiry into the future of the aircraft industry in this country (CC. (57)60th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. I attach the first report by the Working Party of officials set up to undertake this enquiry (Appendix A). The report considers the effect on the industry of thereduction in military requirements for certain types of combat aircraft and thequestion of Government financial support for aeronautical research anddevelopment.3. The conclusions of the Working Party are set out in paragraph 61 on pages11 and 12 of the report. There are three main recommendations:          ^(a) that the Government should continue for the present to support a programme of aeronautical research adequate for both military and civil purposes on condition that the industry reorganises and strengthensitself to the extent necessary to meet the changed conditions with whichit is now faced; and in the expectation that, in the course of time, theindustry will progressively take over the cost of research not requiredfor defence. This research programme should be kept in continuous review;(b) that in the field of civil development, where substantial government assistance may be required in respect of a future generation of aircraft,such as a supersonic transport or those with vertical take off or landingdevices, the Government should at this stage do no more than state their readiness to consider applications for such development assistance on their merits, with due regard to the general financial situation; and(c) that an early statement should be made in Parliament on the question ofGovernment support for aeronautical research and development on thelines of the draft set out at the end of the conclusions.4. The Economic Policy Committee have considered this report and thefollowing is a summary of the Committee&apos;s views :  (i) In general, the Committee agree that, if efficiently organised, the aircraft industry can continue to make a valuable economic contribution to thenation. Government policy should therefore be directed towards urging the industry, in the difficult transitional period of reduced militaryorders and fiercer overseas competition, to concentrate into fewer andstronger units. The Committee considered, and dismissed, thepossibility of withdrawing all Government support from the industry.This might well lead to its collapse. Apart from its defenceimplications, such a policy would be unacceptable in respect of a majorindustry in a modern and expanding field in which the Government hadalready invested heavily and which could, as a result, be expected tomake a substantial contribution to the country&apos;s prosperity and prestige.SECRET53389 B
(ii) The Government should therefore continue not only to sponsor and finance, as necessary, aeronautical research and development to meetdefence requirements, but also to make a substantial contribution tothe finance research on civil air transport. This latter aspect of the government&apos;s support should, however, be kept under review, sincethe ultimate objective should be for the industry to take over the costof research not required for defence. Consideration should be givento the possibility of instituting a small levy on all civil aircraft, engines and spares produced for sale at home or abroad, the proceeds of whichwould be used to help in defraying the costs of basic research. Itwould probably be undesirable to make such a levy in the immediatefuture; but it should be further examined by the Working Party of officials, particularly in relation to the existing development levy.Although its yield might be small, such a levy would reduce theGovernments net expenditure on basic aeronautical research, would establish the principle of financial participation by the industry, andwould help to disarm foreign criticism that the United kingdom industry received a form of export subsidy. In this last connection,the references to the export prospects of the industry in the proposedpublic statement should not lend support to such a charge. On theother hand, the Committee took note that the industry has asked forspecial export credit facilities in order to help it in meeting subsidisedcompetition, particularly from its United States rivals. This requestis being examined by the Working Party of officials.(iii) As regards development expenditure, the industry should be ableincreasingly to finance, the development of new civil projects without government assistance. But the Government should be ready toconsider applications for such assistance in particular cases, e.g., inconnection with a future generation of aircraft and development flying.While there would be some attractions in the Governmenfs coming forward with a programme setting out the scale on which they proposedto support the industry, this would lead to an increasing outlay ofGovernment funds on the industry, contrary to recent policy, and would tend to discourage the industry from taking its own steps towardsrationalisation. It might, moreover, provoke criticism from otherindustries, some of which feel that the aircraft sector already enjoysan undue degree of Government support.(iv) The natural pressures tending to force the industry in the direction offewer and stronger groupings should continue to be supplemented,where possible, by Government action, since progress towardsintegration is likely to be slower than is desirable. The main perhaps the only weapon which the Government can use is the power of contract. Opportunities for using this weapon may not in the future be very frequent; but it should be employed with the maximum effect as occasion offers.(v) The estimate, in paragraph 17 of the Working Party&apos;s report, of the run-down of the total labour force in the industry from its present levelof 350,000 to a level of 90,000 in 1964 (a drop of 74 per cent.) might prove to be pessimistic. This estimate is based on present militaryprogrammes and known civil and export orders; it takes no accounteither of possible developments in these unpredictable fields or ofknown enquiries. There are good grounds for believing, however, thatthe industry, by 1964 if efficiently organised on the basis of only three major air frame companies and two major engine companies should beable to make a full and effective contribution to the national economy.(vi) Difficult employment problems will arise if there is a contraction of theindustry on anything like the scale envisaged by the Working Party.The industry might usefully be asked to give the Government advance information of any intended closures of plant so that, where feasible,employment considerations might be taken into account. some reference to the redundancy problem should be made at the time ofthe projected public announcement, perhaps by way of answer to supplementary questions.
(vii) The existing arrangements for formulating and supervising government policy towards the aircraft industry namely the Working Party of officials and the existing structure of Ministerial Committees seemadequate. The further reports under preparation by the working party will be considered by the Economic Policy Committee as theyare produced. The public statement should refer to the fact thatstudies of other aspects of Government policy in this matter are inhand.(viii) A revised draft of a Parliamentary statement, taking account of thepoints made by the Economic Policy Committee, is also attached(Appendix B). It supersedes that on page 12 of the Working Party&apos;sreport. The Committee suggest that the Minister of Supply shouldbe authorised to make a statement on these lines at the earliest possible opportunity.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,2nd May, 1958.
APPENDIX KSECRETTHE  FUTURE  OF  THE  AIRCRAFT  INDUSTRY :   aeronautical research AND DEVELOPMENTFirst Report by the Aircraft Industry Working PartyIntroductionAt their meeting on 1st August, 1957, the Cabinet invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to arrange for an informal enquiry into the future of the aircraft industry in this country (C.C. (57) 60th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. It was originally proposed that this enquiry should be undertaken by an informal body, consisting partly of industrialists and partly of senior officials of the Treasury, Board of Trade, Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, AirMinistry and Ministry of Supply. Subsequently, it was agreed that the studyshould be made by a Working Party consisting of officials only: the members arelisted at Appendix I.Scope of the Enquiry3.   The main questions which we were asked to consider were:  (a) What reduction will there be in the size of the aircraft industry, by reasonof the new defence policy and what is the time factor involved?(b) Should the reduced industry be re-grouped into a smaller number of units; how is this to be brought about and is it possible to determinewhich of the existing units should be retained?(c) Is it in the national interest that the Government should continue, toprovide financial support to the aircraft industry, and, if so, on whatscale?4. In this first report we consider the expected run-down in the size ofthe industry as a result of the reduction in the military requirements for combat aircraft, the need for a re-organisation of the remaining units in the industry, andthe question of Government support for aeronautical research and development:other factors affecting the future of the aircraft industry will be covered in a subsequent report.The United Kingdom Aircraft industry. For the purposes of our enquiry we have taken the aircraft industry toinclude establishments predominantly engaged in the manufacture of airframes,aero-engines, propellers, undercarriages and guided weapons (excluding electroniccomponents) as well as associated activities such as research and development,repairs and modifications.6. On this definition, there were in the industry, on 31st July, 1957, 89companies in the United Kingdom, employing 255,500 persons; a further 13,000were employed in Government Research Establishments and Service Repair Units.The bulk of the aircraft and aero-engine work was concentrated in 21 companies of which 5 were designing and manufacturing both airframes and aero-engines,14 airframes alone and 2 aero-engines alone.7. It is not possible to segregate the sections engaged on aircraft work ofall the industries which contribute to the making of a complete aircraft; but it isestimated that, excluding electronic work and semi-fabricated materials, theyemploy about 88,000 additional to the numbers given in the previous paragraph.The total labour force in the aircraft industry on 31st July, 1957 was thereforebetween 350,000 and 360,000.Present Nature and Extent of Government Support8. Since the war the aircraft industry in this country has been occupiedprimarily in meeting defence requirements: its size and shape has been dictatedlargely by the military orders for aircraft and more recently for guided weapons.The Government have therefore been the industry&apos;s main customer. For example,
in 1956-57, the total value of the aircraft industry production to meet UnitedKingdom needs was about  244 millions of which about  218 millions was inrespect of military airframes, engines and equipment. The comparable figuresfor 1957-58 are estimated to be  286 millions and  240 millions respectively.Since 1951, the Government have invested  50 millions in capital equipment for research and development purposes. In 1956-57 the Government spent about 103 millions on aeronautical research and development. The estimate for 1957-58was about  119 millions. Between 1951 and 1956, the Government providedcapital assistance to the aircraft industry amounting, at cost, to about  100millions to meet the need for increased production cf military aircraft as a resultof the Korean War. The Government still own the great bulk of the facilities provided by this capital assistance. These figures serve to illustrate the recentnature and extent of Government expenditure on aircraft.Government Help in the Development of Civil Aircraft9. Hitherto civil aviation has benefited from the research and development work undertaken for military purposes. The military need for the most up-to-datetypes of combat aircraft has made it necessary to cover the whole pure researchspectrum and technological advances evolved originally to meet military requirements have subsequently been adopted for civil aircraft.10. By agreement with the United States the United Kingdom deliberatelyabandoned the development and production of transport aircraft during the war to concentrate on that of combat aircraft. Without Government action and finance immediately after the war it would not have been possible for the civilindustry to re-establish itself and in the first place to re-equip the operatingindustry at home and later to gain a share of the rapidly growing world market.The alternative would have been to leave the manufacture of civil aircraftindefinitely to other countries. It was judged preferable to re-create this side ofthe industry for economic and war potential reasons. Government policy was set out in the White Paper on British Air Services (Cmd. 6712), published inDecember, 1945. (Copies of the relevant paragraphs are attached at Appendix 2.)11. This side of the industry has therefore also grown up largely at government expense: generous financial help was in fact given. In the immediate post-war years this took the form of payment of all costs of development for a wide range of interim or conventional types of civil aircraft, even though it was recognisedthat we could not hope to recover their cost. Later, more advanced aircraft usinggas turbine engines were developed largely at the Governments expense. Then,against the background of the growing success of the Viscount and of the Comet Iand also of the industry&apos;s growing military income under the Korean rearmamentprogrammes, the pre-war practice of private venturing was revived. The nextobjective was to limit any Government investment to cases where a reasonable prospect of a return was demonstrated and the starting of the project depended uponGovernment help. The principle of fixing an upper limit to any risk undertaken bythe Government has been firmly established for new projects. More recently, as theindustry has established a foothold in world markets, companies have been induced to take over much or all of the cost and risk of development. Vickers are paying the whole cost of developing the Vanguard for B.E.A. and of the V.C.10 for B.O.A.C.The new joint company, air co-operation , are developing at their own expense the D.H.121,the new jet for B.E.A. The Government are finding only part of the cost of developing the Rolls Royce Tyne engine for the Vanguard, and Rolls Royce arepaying the whole development cost of the new engine for the D.H. 121. But all these projects rest in great measure upon the research programmes which have been undertaken in the past or are still being undertaken by the Government.12. The main hope underlying Government policy in the civil field during thisperiod has been that most of the current main types of aircraft and their parentcompanies would be established in foreign esteem and that their success would create a demand for replacement aircraft and provide the finance to pay for thesereplacements increasingly as private ventures.Other Aspects of Government Support13. Besides meeting the needs of civil aviation, Government expenditure onaeronautical research and development for military purposes has provided the
necessary background of technical knowledge to enable the Air Registration board to discharge their responsibilities in respect of the airworthiness of civil aircraft andthe preparation and implementation of airworthiness rules. Where any additionalresearch or development work has been needed for this purpose and so far thevolume of such work has been small the cost has hitherto been borne on theMinistry of Supply Vote.14. The aircraft industry has been in the van of technological progress. Itsachievements have provided considerable benefits to other industries, not only in thefield of engineering. Aerodynamic discoveries, new systems of propulsion developed for aircraft, new techniques and materials designed to reduce the weight and increasethe strength of aircraft structures have been profitably used in many forms oftransport on land and sea. An assessment by the Ministry of Supply of the technological impact of the aircraft industry on other industries is given inAppendix 3.Reduction in Military Requirements and its Effect on the Industry15. Current defence policy, as announced in the White Paper of April 1957,is to rely, in the long term, increasingly on guided weapons rather than mannedaircraft. Nevertheless, the Services will continue to have requirements for a variety of types of manned aircraft, some of which may well involve novel techniques. But,the reduction in the future demand for fighters and bombers has sharply andsuddenly reduced the Service Departments&apos; requirements from the aircraft industry.16. On the basis of defence requirements so far approved the effect on thelabour force of the aircraft industry will be severe. Compared with the figure of268,500, given in paragraph 6 above, the level of employment by March 1961 islikely to be about 160,000 (about the level at the outbreak of the Korean War). BvMarch 1964 it could fall by a further 100,000, Le., to 60,000 (of which, after deducting those engaged on guided weapons, repairs and spares, &amp;c, only 20,000would be engaged on aircraft production). Further details of this estimated declinein the labour force over the next seven years are given in Appendix 4.17. The figures given in the previous paragraph make no allowance forredundancies among the 88,000 employed in the ancillary and equipmentcompanies. No more than a broad estimate of the decline to be expected in this field is possible. When orders are falling main contractors tend to reduce theirsub-contracts more sharply than their own work. On the other hand, the presenttendency is towards an increase in the amount of specialised equipment in anaeroplane. We consider that a reduction of about 100,000 in the labour forceemployed in the main aircraft industry would lead to a reduction in the associatedindustry of about 30,000. On the basis therefore of the present military programmes and the known civil and export orders, the total labour force in the aircraft industry of about 350,000 will be reduced to about 220,000 by 1961-a reduction of 37 percent: and to about 90,000 by 1964 a total reduction of 74 per cent. It must berecognised that these estimates make no allowance for such additional defence work as may be required, though not yet authorised, or for any expansion in civil business.But, even on a more optimistic assessment of the possibilities of new work, the total labour force in 1964 seems unlikely to be much in excess of 150,000.18. The volume of work in the shops of some companies may be larger at theend of 1962 than it was at the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. But this gives a misleading picture. The cycle of development and production of a new aircraftmay be as long as ten years. Although there are still a number of policy issues tobe settled before a full assessment can be made of future military demands on theaircraft industry most companies in the industry already require or soon will requireto develop a new type of aircraft if they are to continue in the industry as maincontractors, i.e., as designers. Whatever the volume of work which is scheduled tobe in its production shops at the end of 1962, any company which does not in thenear future hold a Government development contract or has no private venture ofits own will know that its days in the aircraft industry are numbered. The designteams will soon disperse.19. The programmes so far authorised for guided weapon development and production will not absorb much of the resources likely to become surplus inthe aircraft industry as a result of this reduction in aircraft work. Only about15,000 of the 260,000 at present employed by the main aircraft contractors are
currently engaged on guided weapon work. This guided weapon labour force isexpected to increase by about 10,000. Foreign orders for guided weapons are not expected to have any very significant effect on the labour situation. Such orderswould provide an additional source of finance for the industry but the mainbenefits on this account would accrue to the electronic industry.20. After 1962-63 the military sector of the industry by itself would rapidlycease to be viable if its present structure remained unchanged, since the remainingwork would be unevenly distributed in small amounts throughout the industry.The full consequences would not be felt in all cases for a year or two owing to demands for spare parts and possibly additional exports; but most firms would no longer be in a position to undertake the development and manufacture of new aircraft, and the cost of production of military aircraft products would rise greatly,largely at the expense of the Government.21. It is clear therefore that the aircraft industry is facing a very difficult period during which there will be a decline in the volume of military requirements for aircraft which will not be compensated for by the programme for guided weapons at present authorised nor significantly affected by an overseas demand forguided weapons. This decline in Government orders is occurring at a time whenthe industry has accepted the full costs involved in the development of the mainnew civil aircraft and before the industry has established itself permanently inthe export field for civil aircraft.Diversification22. In these circumstances one of the possible courses open to the aircraftcompanies is to diversify their business and to convert their facilities from aircraft to non-aircraft work.23. The extent to which the aircraft industry is already diversifying its business is set out in Appendix 5. There are five groups Vickers, english electric, Hawker Siddeley, Hunting and John Brown (Westlands) whose business is diversified to a substantial extent. Only one of these five Hawker Siddeley started life primarily as an aircraft firm: the main interests of the others (and now also of Hawker Siddeley) lie elsewhere.24. .Almost without exception companies in the industry are at presentexploring the possibility of diversifying their business either by acquiring an interest in some other company which is engaged in other kinds of work or byfinding new non-aircraft projects which they can make in their existing factories.The first method is beyond the financial resources of any but a few companies.The second method requires spare managerial and technical capacity of the rightkind. Many companies are qualified to diversify their business in this way butthey are experiencing difficulty in finding products which they can make andothers want to buy. In any event, this process takes time. Moreover, there arephysical limitations on the scope for further diversification. The premises usedfor aircraft assembly are seldom suitable for other forms of production becausethe size of an aircraft demands greater height and space than is needed for most other engineering products.25. It is, however, reasonable to assume that the companies will do everythingthey can to protect themselves from loss and to put their surplus facilities to gooduse. But this course will provide at best only a very partial solution to the problems with which the industry is faced.Work on Civil Aircraft26. The obvious alternative to going out of business for those firms for whichmilitary work is no longer available is to turn increasingly to the development and production of civil aircraft.   All companies are exploring this possibility.Future Prospects for Civil Aircraft Production27. A number of recent assessments have independently led to the conclusionthat there will be a large increase in world demand for air passenger and freight traffic. On a conservative estimate world traffic is expected to double between1955 and 1961 and double again by the end of 1967.   Estimates of the number of
civil aircraft required during the period 1958-70 vary between 3,000 and nearly8,000, representing a volume of trade, including spares, of between  5,000 millions and  11,000 millions. The development of new techniques for vertical or shortlanding and take-off would eliminate the present need for long and expensiverunways at airports: it would thus be possible to use air transport in areas of theworld at present inaccessible to aircraft and, in some cases, served only by primitiveforms of transport.28. The extent to which the United Kingdom industry will be able to takeadvantage of these opportunities will depend on the competitive power of Britishairlines and of the British aircraft manufacturers; and in particular on the ability of the latter to judge the right projects on which to embark and the right moment to start them, as well as on production at competitive prices and on effectivemarketing.Particular Factors Affecting Export Prospects of British Aircraft29. British manufacturers have already established a pre-eminent position inthe field of aero-engines. A comparable status has not yet been won for british civil aircraft. Nevertheless, the percentage of British civil aircraft in service withscheduled airlines is at present about 14 per cent. Deliveries of British civil aircraft for scheduled services for the year 1956-57 represented 42 per cent, of the totaldeliveries in that year and outstanding orders at that time were about 23 per cent.When the Comet IV comes into service at the turn of the year to join the Viscountand Britannia, the three most advanced types of civil aircraft in the world maywell, for a short time, be British. The Viscount is as yet the only one of these whichhas been a substantial success. The Comets and the Britannias have been doggedby ill luck, which have delayed their entry into full use with the result that it willnot be long before the new American jet airliners will be available for commercialoperators. Certain British companies on which future exports would have to depend have still to establish their reputation as manufacturers of civil aircraft.The hope of the British industry rests on the success of the new generation of airliners such as the Vanguard, V.C.10 and D.H.121, the last two of which will bemore advanced types than the new American jets, such as the Boeing 707. It isnot possible to predict what success may be achieved in smaller types, but there could be quite a large market for such aircraft in years to come.30. In its efforts to establish itself in the transport aircraft field, the british aircraft industry will have to contend with severe foreign competition. At present by far the major competitor is the United States aircraft industry, but competition from the French industry in some fields is already growing and in future the russian aircraft industry is likely to enter the export lists.31. Compared with their United States competitors, the British manufacturerswill always be at a disadvantage in having only a small home market for their products. The procurement policies adopted by the British Airways Corporations,the R.A.F. Transport Command and possibly, the independent companies, are ofcrucial importance, since:  (a) the most critical factor which influences a manufacturer^ decision whether to develop a new aircraft as a private venture is the size of the initialorder; and(b) the chances of selling aircraft (and also engines, though perhaps to a lesser extent) overseas are greatly reduced unless they have been selected bya home operator.32. Unless they receive a substantial order, preferably from a home user,few companies will be prepared to finance the development of any large aircraft.Recent experience suggests that in the case of a large airliner an order of about35 aircraft is necessary.33. The cost of development of an engine and the long period over which its development expenditure has to be recovered are on the whole greater than thoseof an airframe. An initial order of rather more engines than is appropriate toan order for about 35 aircraft may therefore be needed to induce a private venture.34. It does not, however, follow that in the case of either aircraft or enginesthese conclusions will necessarily hold good in the future, since it is impossible
at present to foretell whether the aircraft of the 1970&apos;s will be supersonic or subsonicor whether they will make use of special take-off and landing techniques. It is,however, evident that in any case there will be, in the next few years, a bigtechnical step forward in aircraft design, comparable to the change over frompiston engines to jets and turbo-propeller engines. The technical and financial risks involved in developing aircraft of these novel types will therefore be large.35. It has now been accepted that the passenger transport requirements ofthe Royal Air Force should be satisfied, wherever possible, by aircraft developed to serve a civil purpose as well and it may be possible to extend this practice tocover at least some types of freighters. The requirements of the Royal Air Force,and civil users are co-ordinated by the Transport Aircraft Requirements Committee.When Transport Command has completed its present Britannia re-equipment programme it may be some time before it again becomes a big buyer of new types.Although there may well be some specialised military requirements there are goodgrounds for hoping that the future requirements of the Corporations and ofTransport Command will on occasions be aggregated to provide an order large enough to enable the manufacturer to undertake the development of a new typeof aircraft as a private venture. But it is unlikely that many projects can be launched in this way for several years. It will be necessary therefore to lookincreasingly to overseas buyers to provide a balancing requirement.36. In short, it must be recognised that apart from the technical and financial risks inevitably involved in the development and successful commercialexploitation of a large new aircraft, the aircraft industry in this country has to contend with a number of special difficulties before it can count on a worth-whileshare of the prospective increase in the world export market for transport aircraft.Possible Courses of Action37. On the basis of the current defence policy, and in the light of the knownrequirements for civil aircraft during the period up to 1964, there will not besufficient projects to maintain a viable and healthy aircraft industry at anything like the present level. Contraction of the industry is inevitable and many companies will have to wind up their aircraft activities. But since there will still be a continuing need for a variety of military aircraft, the Government will have adirect interest in ensuring that the industry is re-organised efficiently to meet the changed conditions so that these continuing military requirements are met, andmet economically.38. The costs involved in the development of new types of civil aircraft area further reason for strengthening the manufacturing units. It may take anythingfrom four to ten years, depending on its type, to develop one of these new aircraft.The unit cost of large aircraft is already between  1-2 millions. Moreover, theexpenditure is heaviest during the initial stage and the costs of establishing a production line are large. Thus, up to the time when a project may be expectedto demonstrate its commercial success, sums of up to  20 millions may be at riskfor varying periods of up to ten years. Companies will not be able to raise on themarket the sums of money likely to be required unless they are seen to be technically and financially sound.39. For reasons of history and because of the multiplicity of the military requirements which have hitherto been its main business, the aircraft industry atpresent consists of many units, most of which are too small and too weak to carryunaided the great costs and risks in the development of large new aircraft.40. If follows that if the United Kingdom is to retain a healthy industry, oneof the necessary conditions of success is that the technical, commercial and financial resources of the industry should be concentrated in a smaller number of strongerunits.Rationalisation of the Aircraft Industry41. The Ministry of Supply have been making efforts for over a year to rationalise the industry and to concentrate its resources in fewer but stronger units.The means open to them (with an abruptly diminishing number of government contracts) have been limited. The number of manufacturing units which the future military programmes and civil programmes discussed in this report need for their
efficient implementation cannot and need not be exactly defined. But it is theview of the Ministry of Supply that in the long term they will not call for morethan three airframe companies and two engine companies and Ministry of Supplypolicies have been directed towards such a solution.42. With Cabinet approval, the contract for the purchase of a jet airlinerby B.E.A. was recently used to carry forward this policy of rationalisation; thisled to the creation of a joint company, air co-operation , which it is hoped will take overgradually the aircraft business of de Havilland (and their associate Saunders Roe),Fairey and Hunting, and also to the establishment of a close association betweenthe Hawker Siddeley Group and Bristol, which may possess the seeds of furthergrowth.43. The three airframe groups of the future, as envisaged by the Ministry ofSupply, are likely to include one with Vickers in the civil lead (perhaps in association with English Electric and Shorts). Assuming that the award of theB.E.A. jet contract to air co-operation  is confirmed, this company will form the nucleus of a second group concerned with transport aircraft. It is still an open questionwhether there will be room for a third aircraft group and, if so, which companies will form its nucleus; if the Bristol/Hawker association survives the loss of theB.E.A. jet order, that consortium will be the obvious candidate. The two enginegroups are likely to include one with the present Rolls-Royce company in the lead. The second engine group is likely to include the Bristol facilities becauseof their excellence, even though the Bristol Company may not itself be in the lead.44. We think that if it proves possible to retain two engine groups on aneconomic footing, competing with each other, this would be advantageous in tworespects. First, the need to compete for the British home and export marketrather than to exploit it as a monopoly would provide Rolls-Royce (the only possible monopolist) with a useful spur to technical development. Secondly, thecost of meeting both direct Government requirements and the needs of the british airways Corporations, in which the Government also have a financial interest, willbe lower if they are satisfied by two groups in competition rather than by a monopoly.45. The reshaping of the aircraft industry and the amalgamation ofparticular companies in it raise questions of a delicate commercial nature. We donot think that it would be practicable for the Government to determine in detailwhich companies should be amalgamated and to some extent it is immaterialwhether certain of the smaller companies which are not engaged on civil aircraftamalgamate with the leading civil companies or go out of the industry. TheGovernment should use all forms of influence at their disposal, including the placing of contracts, to bring about a reorganisation of the industry on the lines suggested above. The continuation of any Government assistance for the industry should be made conditional on the industry carrying out, to the satisfaction of theGovernment, the necessary degree of reorganisation..Requests for Government Action by the Industry and Others46. The aircraft manufacturers are concerned lest the reduction in military requirements for aircraft will be followed by an abandonment of government support for research and development. The Society of British Aircraft Constructorshave represented:  (a) that Government support for aeronautical research should continue;(b) that the Government should continue in specific cases to sponsor thedevelopment of advanced types of transport aircraft even though theremay be no military requirement for them;(c) that to overcome the handicap of the small domestic market for civil aircraft in the United Kingdom, the Government, should be prepared to underwrite production in advance of firm export orders, perhaps as analternative to contributing towards the costs of development; and(d) that better, and in particular longer term, credit facilities should be madeavailable by the Export Credits Guarantee Department in respect of aircraft exports.47. The Air Registration Board and the British Overseas Airways corporation have also made representations about future Government support for aeronautical research and development.   The Air Registration Board have emphasised the
importance of continued Government support for aeronautical research forairworthiness purposes. The British Overseas Airways Corporation would likeaeronautical research and development to continue over a wide field so that theycould have a choice in deciding how their future requirements should be met.They have also suggested that Transport Command should be used to test newcivil projects before the aircraft are introduced into commercial service. these and other matters affecting the determination of the civil aeronautical research and development programme will be considered in a further report.The General Case for Further Government Support48. The extent of the support which the Government will need to give tothe industry because of the continuing military requirement cannot be foreseen.But we are satisfied that, on current defence policy, if no support beyond what isrequired for this purpose were to be given from now onwards the industry wouldafter a time cease to exist as a producer of major civil aircraft for home use andfor export. If this were to occur it would, in the long run, prove difficult and perhaps impossible to maintain an efficient industry solely devoted to the fillingof military needs. We might well find that by withdrawing from the civil fieldwe had also rendered ourselves incapable in the end of filling our military needfrom cur own resources (save at prohibitive expense) and thus made ourselvesdependent on foreign production for defence purposes.49. Engineering products make up a large proportion of our exports. Inthe past, we have been in the lead in developing new forms of transport, such asrailways, shipping, motor vehicles and aircraft, and advanced engineeringequipment and techniques. Our future prosperity depends on the efficiency and progressive expansion of our engineering industry and its ability to develop andexploit new products, new techniques, and new materials. To achieve this we must remain in the van of technological progress. Aeronautical engineering has inrecent years been a major contributor to this process and Appendix 3 indicatesthe benefits that have accrued to other industries from new developments in theaeronautical field. Aeronautical engineering can be expected to continue to makea contribution of this kind to further progress. It must be open to question whether we could maintain our position as one of the major exporters of engineering products, if we abandoned the development and manufacture of aircraft whichis the most advanced and rapidly progressing form of modern transport.50. Having regard to what we say in paragraph 27 above about the probablefurther world demand for civil aircraft we have made (through a Sub-Committee)a special interdepartmental survey of the possible British share in the filling ofthis demand in the future. There is inevitably much uncertainty about this.Future world demand itself though it will certainly expand rapidly is veryvariously estimated and the range between minimum and maximum expectations isvery great. The possible British share in filling this demand is more uncertainstill. It follows that any forecasts of the future economic benefit of the aircraft industry to the national economy must inevitably be speculative; the answers differwidely according to the assumptions that are made. The critical issue is whetherthe British aircraft industry can produce a series of successful types of major civil aircraft. If it can, the industry could be both efficient and profitable, the amount and duration of Government support would be limited, and the granting of this government support could be justified by ordinary economic criteria. In thesecircumstances, it can also be presumed that the balance of payments would be favourably affected by the existence of the industry. Thus an efficient and profitableaircraft industry would be a good national investment. On the other hand, anunprofitable industry producing mainly uncompetitive aircraft, would be a poorinvestment and even if it could be shown which would not be easy that thebalance of payments might suffer from its disappearance, this could not be regardedas a decisive argument in its favour.51. In considering whether the continuation of Government support for theaircraft industry would lead to a sensible and efficient use of national resources, thepossible long-term effect on the balance of payments must clearly be taken intoaccount. It is not, however, the sole, nor even the main aspect to be considered,since the achievement of a surplus in the balance of payments is only a means to theultimate aim of policy which is to maintain and improve the standard of living.
On the other hand, the aircraft industry is one of a small group of industries (e.g.,chemicals, petroleum, atomic energy and electronics) whose prospects for expansionappear very good, and it may be that the aircraft industry has better prospects than any. On this view it would be inadvisable to abandon one of the best possibilitiesof using economic resources to the best purpose (and thus benefiting the balance ofpayments) in favour of other possibilities which cannot as yet be defined. It must,of course, be an important objective of policy to see how this can be done withoutdenying the skilled research requirements of other major industries, such aschemicals, atomic energy and electronics.The form of Government SupportResearch52. Of the proposals listed in paragraph 46 the aircraft industry attach mostimportance to the first i.e., the continuance of Government support foraeronautical research. This is not because assistance of this kind provides a directsource of income for the industry (except marginally, e.g., through research work done by companies on Government account) but because the continuance of a forward-looking programme of research is an essential pre-requisite to the continued existence of an efficient and viable aircraft industry. Because of the cost of sucha programme, of the very long time cycle before investment in it will yield itsreward, of the uncertainty of the size of that reward, and finally of the present difficulties which beset the industry as a result of the changes in defence policy, it isclear that the industry will be unable to finance such a programme itself for a longtime to come.53. Such a programme will not be worth while unless it is wide in character and omits no major aspect of aeronautical development. The pace of development in the field of aeronautical science is still increasing rapidly: and the area of researchwhich must be covered is still growing. It took 50 years to reach the speed of sound.In the last five years speeds several times as great have come within reach. To have any certainty of obtaining useful results, the programme must cover the spectrum.To exclude some area of research for a reason which, in the light of currentknowledge may seem conclusive, is to risk nullification of the work through the emergence later of an unexpected development. One illustration of this may begiven among many: in the 1930&apos;s it was proved conclusively that aeroplanes couldnot be made to achieve supersonic speeds because piston engines could not produce the necessary power. On this ground research into supersonic flight was held to befruitless. But this view failed entirely to reckon with the revolution which was laterbrought about by the development of jet propulsion.54. There are other reasons why Government support for the aircraft industry should in the first place take the form of the provision of research;(a) Nearly all aeronautical research has hitherto been financed in othercountries as well as in the United Kingdom for military purposes; andforeign companies engaged on the production of transport aircraft havehad a large military business. Our foreign competitors will presumablycontinue to enjoy these advantages.(b) It is not possible to draw a hard and fast line between research for civil purposes and that which will continue to be required to meet military needs, both for aircraft and for guided weapons. But by extending theprogramme of future research beyond the minimum required for military purposes, the Government will not only provide a continuing basis for civil production but will increase the effectiveness of the militaryprogramme.(c) The continuance of a wide programme of aeronautical research should enable the aircraft industry to maintain its stimulus to advancedtechnological development in other fields of engineering.(d) The physical resources necessary are so large and so expensive and already exist, in the main, in Government Establishments.55. These arguments lead us to the view that the Government should decide to continue for the present to support an adequate and broadly based programmeof aeronautical research. They do not lead us, however, to suggest a long-termcommitment free of conditions or that even on conditions the Government should either commit itself publicly or even decide upon the size of the programme or thelevel of expenditure for a long time ahead.   Though, as we have said, the
programme should adequately &quot; cover the spectrum,&quot; it should have regard to thelimits within which it is reasonable and advantageous to commit both financial and technological resources in the support of this one industry. It should therefore bekept under continuous review with regard to these factors and to the economic andother advantages which seem likely to derive from it in the future.56. Hitherto almost the whole cost of aeronautical research in this country has been borne as an item of defence expenditure. In the present financial year asum of  27 millions is being thus provided. For accounting purposes some 7 millions of this is regarded as &quot; civil,&quot; though there is still a military interest inthe whole of the existing programme and this interest seems likely to be sustained atany rate for some years. It is estimated by the Ministry of Supply that in the nextfew years the direct military justification for aeronautical research may fall to an extent which would leave a requirement of perhaps some  10 to  12 millions a yearto be undertaken on civil account if the total programme is to remain adequate toenable the civil side of the industry to remain viable and effective and to make the contribution to the filling of world demand which it should be possible for it to achieve. It is not possible for us as a Working Party to form any consideredjudgment of this estimate for any length of time ahead; and in view of theoverlapping civil and defence interests which will continue for many years it isscarcely necessary to do so. It is right for us to point out, however, that if as we contemplate a programme of this nature and this order is to be continued for someyears on Government account, it will involve a level of research assistance to thisparticular industry which outside the field of defence is afforded to no other industry with the important exception of atomic energy. Comparative figures are given inAppendix 6.57. Although research is the form of Government assistance on which theindustry have laid most stress, it is by no means the only form of assistance for whichthey have asked. This Report is, however, directed only to Government assistance on research and development; we shall make a further report on other matters, suchas the possibility of additional assistance in relation to export credits.58. In the field of development the Government will need to continue to meetmost of the cost of projects arising from military requirements. Where civildevelopment is concerned, Government expenditure on the present generation of aircraft is expected to decline in the next few years from the present (1958-59)figure of  8-5 millions. The reason is that the manufacturers have acceptedresponsibility for the development costs of the majority of the new major civil aircraft projects. As stated above (paragraph 46), however, the industry would likean assurance that the Government will be ready, in specific cases, to sponsor thedevelopment of advanced types of transport aircraft.59. As far as we are able to judge, the development of a future generation of aircraft (e.g., supersonic transports or those with vertical take-off and landingdevices) may be able to take place only if substantial Government assistance is madeavailable. Such aircraft would represent so big a technical step forward that therisk, even if there were a good initial order, may be greater than the manufacturers would be prepared to carry, or their bankers to finance. At this stage, however,we consider that the Government should do no more than state its readiness toconsider applications for development assistance on their merits, with due regard tothe general financial situation. The Government should not, in our view, enterinto any commitment to provide a given annual rate of expenditure on development.Statement of Government Policy60. The industry needs to know where it stands in regard to future government assistance, particularly in relation to Government support for research and development. There has been much pressure for a clear statement of future government policy and the Minister of Supply has undertaken to make such astatement to Parliament as quickly as possible. We recommend that a statement should now be made on the lines of the draft which immediately follows our conclusions below. As will be seen from that draft we consider that such astatement should not only make continued Government assistance for research (andin special cases for development) dependent on a satisfactory reorganisation of theindustry but should declare the expectation that in the course of time the industry
itself will progressively take over the expenditure required. It should not involvea specific commitment to expenditure at any given level; and the scale of theprogramme should be kept under review with regard to the demands which it makeson national financial and technological resources, to the progress of the industryin relation to world markets, and to the prospects of advantage to the balance ofpayments as well as to the size and nature of the research and development programmes which continue to be necessary for defence purposes.Conclusions61.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows:  (1) Notwithstanding the fact that the military demand, which has hithertoprovided the main business of the aircraft industry, will.be smaller than in recent years, we shall continue to need an efficient aircraft industry for defence purposes.(2) The change in defence policy has already resulted in a decline in newmilitary projects which has affected the demand on the design and long-term planning resources of the industry. In a few years this change will also result in an increasing diminution in the demand onthe production facilities and in the size of the labour force.(3) The progressive expansion of our engineering industry on which our future prosperity depends requires that we should remain in the vanof the development, production and export of as wide a range aspossible of advanced engineering equipment. If, therefore, we wereto abandon the development and manufacture of aircraft, which isthe most advanced and rapidly progressing form of modern transport,it is doubtful whether we should be able, in the long run, to maintain our position as one of the leading exporters of engineering products.(4) In the aircraft industry we have built up an economic asset. There will,in future, be a big increase in the world demand for transport aircraft,and if we can successfully exploit this potential increase in civilbusiness, the economic value of the aircraft industry will increase.(5) At present there are not enough new projects (civil or military) in trainor contemplated to keep the United Kingdom industry sufficientlyviable and healthy so that it can compete effectively in the longer termin the prospective export markets without, first, some measure ofGovernment support, at least for the time being, and, second, a concentration of its technical, commercial and financial resources ina smaller number of stronger units.(6) The continuation of Government support should, therefore, be on thecondition that the aircraft industry does so reorganise and strengthenitself. The progress made by the industry to this end should be kept under review.(7) The primary requirement in the way of Government support arises inthe field of research. Hitherto, almost the whole cost of aeronautical research in this country has been met by the Government as an item of defence expenditure, but it is likely that in future the militaryresearch programme will progressively fall short of the needs of civilaviation. Nevertheless, no hard and fast line can be drawn, at anyrate at present, between military and civil research requirements. TheGovernment should therefore support a programme of researchadequate for both military and civil purposes in the expectation thatin the course of time the industry will progressively take over the costof the research not required for defence. In a further report, themachinery for determining the programme of such research will be examined.(8) In 1958-59  27 millions is being provided from the Exchequer foraeronautical research, of which for accounting purposes some 7 millions is regarded as &quot; civil.&quot; It has been estimated that thecivil element in the total research programme may amount in future to about  10-12 millions a year. The Government should not however commit themselves to any given figure in respect of financial support for civil research.(9) If the industry is properly organised and the projects on which it embarksare sound, the new stronger units ought to be able to find sufficient
DRAFT GOVERNMENT statement the Government have had under consideration, in the light of the currentdefence policy, the future of the British aircraft industry, and in particular thefuture scale of Government support for that industry.Despite the reduction in demand for certain types of manned combat aircraft,there will still be a need for an efficient aircraft industry to meet the Services&apos;requirements for aircraft and guided weapons. The Government will therefore continue, as necessary, to sponsor and finance aeronautical research anddevelopment to meet these defence requirements.In addition to its important defence role, the aircraft industry has been making,with Government assistance, a valuable contribution to meeting our needs for civil aircraft, to technological progress over a wide field of industry and to our balanceof payments through the growing exports of military and civil aircraft, aero-engines and ancillary equipment. So long as the progress of the industry in relation to world markets justifies the expenditure of the public money involved, theGovernment intend to continue to finance aeronautical research in the civil transportfield, where this is not already covered by the research necessary for defence purposes, on a scale adequate to enable the industry to command a worthwhileshare of the expanding world markets in the future. The Government have taken this decision in the expectation that in the course of time the industry itself willprogressively take over this Government expenditure on civil research. In the government&apos;s view, however, it would be fruitless to continue this expenditureunless the industry reorganises and strengthens itself to the extent necessary tomeet the changed conditions with which it is now faced. The Government will,therefore, watch the progress made by the industry to this end.As regards development the Government consider that, provided the necessaryreorganisation is carried out, the aircraft industry should in general be able tocontinue to finance the development of new civil projects without government assistance. It is recognised, however, that in certain cases some measure ofGovernment support may still be required. Such cases will be considered ontheir merits.(Signed) T. PADMORE,On behalf of the Working Party.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th April, 1958.resources on the market to finance, without Government assistance,the development of most of the civil transport aircraft required.Nevertheless, there may in special cases be claims for government assistance on development. Any such claims should be considered on their merits.(10) Other possible forms of Government assistance for which the industry has asked (e.g., production guarantees, special credit facilities) will bedealt with in a further report.(11) The industry are entitled to guidance on future Government policy inrelation to aeronautical research and development. There has already-been pressure for clarification of the Governments attitude and anearly statement has been promised to Parliament. We recommendtherefore a public announcement on the lines of the draft set out belowshould be made at an early date.

It will be the general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to require the corporations to use British aircraft types. As a result of wartime policies agreed with our Allies, transport aircraft were not produced in this country during the war,and the development of British civil aircraft has been interrupted since 1938. Atthe moment we are, on this account, placed at a grave disadvantage. Civil air services in the immediate future must, therefore, be built up on aircraft which havebeen developed from basic military types. These will be followed by aircraftmainly based on types recommended by the Brabazon Committee. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are taking all possible steps to accelerate the production of civil aircraft both for the equipment of British air lines and for the export trade.28. Research and. Development, and Design of Aircraft. Air line operationdepends for its advancement on technical progress, for success or failure is moredependent on the type of equipment used than on any other factor. Creativeresearch and development, therefore, is indispensable to advancement in an industry of which technical progress is the life blood. An air line, equipped with outmodedaircraft, no matter how efficiently its operations and business are conducted, will soon be outdistanced by another using aircraft of superior and more economicalperformance. The fullest emphasis will therefore be laid on research anddevelopment connected with air line operation. It is not proposed to set up aseparate research department for Civil Aviation, but Civil Aviation is receivingequal status with other claimants in aeronautical research fostered by the State.Arrangements have already been made for representatives of the Ministry of CivilAviation to join on an equal footing with representatives of the Services in theM.A.P. Committees which determine the allocation of design resources and the priority of development projects.
APPENDIX 3THE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT industry note by the Ministry of SupplyThis Appendix gives examples of the part the aircraft industry has played inthe technological advancement of United Kingdom industry.Materials1. The stringent design and performance requirements of the aircraft industryin metallic and non-metallic materials have greatly influenced the rate of progressin this field.(i) Metallic MaterialsAluminium alloys which were developed for aircraft are now used in the formof castings, sheet, plate, forgings, tubing and extrusions throughout the engineering industry where strength and lightness are required, e.g., in road and rail transport,cranes, bridging.Titanium, a metal possessing qualities of lightness, strength and heat resistance,is still in the early stages of development for aircraft purposes, but non-aircraft usesare already beginning to be found in other fields such as chemical engineering.The Nimonic series of alloys, developed for gas turbine blades and othercomponents, now has a wide commercial application in the chemical and electricalindustries.The heat resistant steels developed for gas turbines are now used extensively inother fields such as atomic energy.Ultra high strength steels have been required for advanced aircraft structuresand new techniques, including vacuum melting, which were developed to producethese steels, are affecting other engineering designs.Special bearing materials originally developed for aero-engines of the thin walllead-indium/iridium shell type are now widely used for internal combustionengines.(ii) Non-Metallic MaterialsPerspex, a thermoplastic transparent material developed for use on aircraftcanopies, &amp;c, now has many other uses such as corrugated roofing lights, road signs,contact lenses, surgical instruments, artificial legs and wind shields.Resins reinforced with glass or asbestos fibres which were developed for use in aircraft for intricate ducting, radomes and drop tanks, are now used throughout industry in, for example, motor-car and bus bodies, caravans, boats&apos; storage tanks,roofing materials and large radar scanners.Certain types of nylon, especially in the high strength grades, which weredeveloped for specialised applications such as parachute materials, cordage, air /searescue dinghies, Mae Wests, lock nuts and aircraft tyres, now have applications inother industries.Certain compounds of synthetic rubber such as Silicone rubbers, Neoprene,Thiokols and Butyl rubbers, which were developed to withstand different levels oftemperature, ageing, attacks from fuels, lubricants and coolants in aircraft, are nowused extensively in many industries.Special adhesives such as Araldite, Redux, Hidux and Bostik and synthetic resinglues (Kaurit, Beetle, TEGO), are now widely used outside the aircraft industry.Heat and sound insulation properties required in aircraft have resulted in thedevelopment of glass-type silica fibres and these are now extensively used in industry.The development of optical quality toughened and curved glass for aircraft hashad a beneficial effect on the production of windscreens for the motor industry.
Production, Development and Inspection2. Many methods and techniques of development, production and inspectionthat were devised by the aircraft industry have been adopted by other sections ofindustry.(i) Casting and Foundry work  the development of resin bounded sand moulds for aircraft use has enabled the foundry industry to produce castings, particularly those featuring thin walls, ofa higher degree of accuracy and more rapidly than before.The demand for gas turbine blades caused the rebirth of the technique ofprecision casting to replace complex machining operations in &quot; difficult &quot; materials.Thousands of intricately shaped medium sized parts that iequire little or no furthermachining, such as gears, milling cutters and sewing machine components, are now made by this process.(ii) Welding MethodsThe high quality of weld required by the aircraft industry encouraged theadoption of inert atmosphere welding (helium or argon gas shielded electrodes), andthe establishment of non-destructive inspection techniques including the use ofgamma rays. These are now widely used in the engineering industry.(iii) Machining Methods and Metal FormingThe use of high strength steels for aircraft demanded improvement in theruggedness and effectiveness of machine tools. Special cutting steels and carbidesand cooling methods (carbon dioxide) were accordingly developed with benefit toother industries.The rubber die press technique and subsequent developments incorporatinghydraulic cushions, which originated in the aircraft industry, are to-day replacinghand formed sheet metal parts in other industries.The large number of precision dies required for turbine blades have promotedthe development of new die making methods such as die hobbing, chemical etching,ultrasonic and spark machining and ultra high speed die finishing equipment. Allthese methods are being applied in other industries.(iv) InspectionImproved methods of inspection, such as radiographic inspection of light alloycastings, were devised to match the development of new materials and techniques and the demand for interchangeability and for general quality control.Radiography is to-day universally applied to castings of all types in foundriesof repute and the techniques are also used in other fields such as welding, plasticmouldings and inspection of assembled articles.Non-destructive methods of flaw detection by ultrasonic, penetrant andmagnetic flaw detection techniques developed for aircraft are now widely usedin industry, e.g., in the inspection of railway tracks, railway rolling stock and bridges.Optical tooling measurement apparatus developed for the aircraft industry for measurement of large jigs and fixtures have found wider application in thecivil engineering fields where alignment telescopes are now used as for example in the B.E.P.O. pile (British Experimental Pile, Zero Energy) at Harwell.Machine Tools3. The demands of the aircraft industry have led the machine tool and thegauge and tool industries to develop special machine tools, frequently utilisingnew techniques in the application of fully automatic/electronic controls.Developments now being undertaken by such firms as E.M.I., Ferranti, ElliottBros, and others in tape and punched card control of machine tools are in thefirst instance for the aircraft industry.Electronics4. The aircraft industry&apos;s demands for (advanced and complex) componentscapable of being interchanged and of great reliability have given the electronicsindustry an impetus towards precision engineering which has benefited a wide range of its products.
Instruments and Watch industry. The high precision small size, ruggedness and reliability demanded of aircraft instruments has had a direct effect on the quality of the commercialproducts offered by these industries.Management Skill6. The intricate nature of aeronautical products demands close attentionto planning techniques and production/quality control. Standards set by theaircraft industry have been adopted by other industries as have some of itsmethods, e.g., the use of electronic computing machines. The close technicalcollaboration between groups of firms making analogous products sets a modelfor others.Education7. The aircraft industry makes a direct contribution to technical education.Comprehensive apprenticeship schemes are operated by all the main firms andtechnical colleges are also run by de Havilland, Bristol and the Ministry of Supply&apos;royal Aircraft Establishment. Degree courses in aeronautical engineering areoffered at London, Bristol, Cambridge, Southampton, Glasgow and BelfastUniversities. The College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, provides advanced specialisttraining.   Power Jets run courses on gas turbine technology.Miscellaneous8/ (i) Development of hydraulic equipment for aircraft led to the use ofhydraulic pit props for mines and wagon buffers for railways.(ii) Hydraulically operated lifting gear and actuators now employ techniquesdeveloped for aircraft.(iii) Many aircraft general stores, including proprietary lock nuts (pioneeredby the Simmonds nut), fasteners, electric connectors and wiring parts, flexiblehigh pressure hose and flame-proof hose, hose couplings (the Jubilee clip), specialtypes of rivets, particularly those for blind applications have found ready application in general engineering.(iv) Standardisation of common components was pioneered by the aircraft industry during the war and the methods have been adopted widely in industry,saving considerable productive effort.(v) Paint standards and properties, particularly for the protection of metalparts, have been greatly improved to meet stringent aircraft specifications.(vi) Advances in packaging of finished parts and sub-assemblies and inparticular the method of cocooning used by the aircraft industry have been givenwider application in export markets where the effects of humidity have hitherto been serious.9. Aircraft will be required in future to fly faster and higher and to takeoff and land vertically or in a short distance. Structures built to closer tolerances,materials to withstand the effects of kinetic heating, high energy fuels, and improvedancillary equipment will be needed. And these in turn will call for new techniquesof development and production. In mastering the new demands it is open to theaircraft industry to make a further contribution to the technological advance ofother industries.

APPENDIX 6RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenditure . Total United Kingdom Research and development in 1957-58 total Research and Development expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is expected to be some  310 millions, including  53 millions by the atomic Energy Authority.An estimate for Research and Development expenditure by industry made in1956 put the total in 1955 at  80 millions.The total, Government and non-Government, is probably therefore of theorder of  400 millions.2. Government Research and development expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for 1957-58 has been estimated as follows:  Defence   millions&quot; Defence Budget &quot;..................      223*(including aeronautical        ...        107 millions)*Atomic Expenditure not at present included in &quot; defence budget&quot;        ..................       20Total       ......       ...........      243 millionsCivil   millionsAeronautical ............-......       12.

Appendix draft STATEMENT ON THE AIRCRAFT industry the Government have had under consideration, in the light of current defence policy, the future of the British aircraft industry and in particular the future scale and nature of Government support for that industry.2. The aircraft industries of all countries, including our own, have from theirearly days been supported by work done in Government Establishments, and theyhave grown up with the help of Government contracts for research, development and production. Although some contraction in the present size of the Britishindustry is inevitable, the cessation of Government support now might well be thefirst step towards the end of the United Kingdom as an aircraft manufacturingcountry.3. Despite the reduction in demand for certain types of manned combat aircraft, there will still be a need for an efficient aircraft industry to meet theServices&apos; requirements for aircraft and guided weapons. The Government will therefore continue, as necessary, to sponsor and finance aeronautical research anddevelopment to meet these defence requirements.4. In addition to its important defence role, the aircraft industry has been making a valuable contribution to meeting our needs for civil aircraft, and totechnological progress over a wide field of industry. It has been helped in this by government research work undertaken for defence purposes. So long as the achievements of the industry justify the expenditure of the public money involved,the Government intend to continue to make a financial contribution to aeronautical research in the expanding field of civil transport, where this is not already coveredby the research necessary for defence purposes; such finance will be on a scaleadequate to enable the industry to maintain its leading position. The Governmenthave taken this decision in the expectation that in course of time the industry itselfwill progressively take over this Government expenditure on civil research. In the government&apos;s view, however, it would be fruitless to continue this expenditureunless the industry reorganises and strengthens itself to the extent necessary tomeet the changed conditions with which it is now faced. The Government will,therefore, watch the progress made by the industry to this end.5. As regards development, the Government consider that, provided thenecessary reorganisation is carried out, the aircraft industry should in generalbecome increasingly able to finance the development of new civil projects without government assistance. There may be special cases, however, and these will beconsidered on their merits.6.   Other problems affecting the future of the industry are still being studied.53389G
