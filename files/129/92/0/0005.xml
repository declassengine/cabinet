CABINETEGYPT - FINANCIAL negotiations memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the talks with Egypt have again been adjourned, and my colleagues may like to know the background.2.     The talks were resumed at Rome on 25th February, after a previous adjournment to enable the Egyptian negotiators to seekinstructions from their Government on a draft Agreement that was handed to them by our delegation without commitment.   The mostdoubtful points were whether the Egyptians would object to -(a) arrangements for neutral assessment, where necessary, ofthe value of United   Kingdom property that has beenEgypt ianised;(b) our proposal that they should write off their claim for compensation for &quot;war damage&quot; against our claim forGovernment property in the Suez Canal Base.3.      They apparently decided not to raise any question of principleover (a) - though they suggested limitations which need further discussion - but they pressed (b).    They argued that their war damageclaims exceed the value of the Base by some  30 millions.    If they wereto maintain this position it might destroy any prospect of agreement.There would be general objections to conceding any liability on our partfor &quot;war damage&quot; but, apart from that, a further concession of anything like  30 millions would destroy the balance of the proposals on which wehave been working.     The Egyptians were told, therefore, that the onlysolution likely to be acceptable to us on this point would be to drop theproposal for an exchange of notes agreeing to a mutual cancellation ofGovernment claims and revert to an earlier proposal that such claimsshould be postponed for discussion at a later stage.    (We have consideredthe risk that they might then take their &quot;war damage&quot; claims to theInternational Court, but they would not be able to do so, at any ratewithout our consent.)4.     The Egyptian delegation were unwilling to refer this suggestionback to their Government unless they could couple with it modifications ofthe agreement in certain other respects.    But the modifications that theywere prepared to consider had some advantages as well as disadvantagesfrom our point of view.5.      The broad features of the draft agreement were:-(i) A payment by the Egyptians as a pledge that they would pay compensation for Egyptianised property, the value of theproperty to be assessed in cases of dispute by a neutralC.(58) 554th March, 1953(THIS DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.
assessor. (We expected the advance payment to be 30 millions, though as a matter of tactics we were still asking for  34 millions. )(ii)   The return of  property that has been sequestrated andis still under Egyptian Government control.(iii) The reservation for later discussion of our claims inrespect of sequestrated property restored in impairedcondition.(iv) A right for owners of sequestrated property who do not wish to return to Egypt to dispose of their property andto transfer the equivalent of at least  5,000 of the proceeds into sterling.(v)   Owners would have the right to appoint agents (eitherEgyptian firms or representatives sent out from here,e. g. , by arrangement between several owners actingjointly) to negotiate the disposal of their property andto pursue any claims in respect of damage,(vi) A resumption of trade with Egypt (on broadly speakingpre-Suez terms).(vii)  A release of sterling to Egypt on a formula estimated togive her  23 millions out of which she would be due topay out to the United Kingdom firms something like 6 millions in respect of pre-Suez contracts.6.      Under this plan we should, of course, have had to hold on to asubstantial part of Egypfs sterling balances until we could see how thenext round of talks went in regard to (iii).     The Egyptians do not like that feature of the draft agreement and they showed themselves readyto consider:-(a) an advance payment of  30 millions in respect ofEgyptianised property (as before);(b) an additional deposit of  X millions (our own delega-tion had in mind  5 millions) to be earmarkedagainst compensation for sequestrated property -the amount of this compensation to be assessed by negotiation between the Egyptian Government andthe British owners.(c) compensation for damage to sequestrated property tobe paid in Egyptian pounds;(d) pari passu releases from the  X millions deposit tothe No. 2 (blocked) Account in the first instance;(e) a procedure under which further releases of sterling would be made to Egypt once the compensation forEgyptianised property had been assessed and paid.(The United Kingdom would also be willing toconsider earlier releases in the light of progress
made in the assessment of compensation forEgyptianised property. )In addition the delegation recommended that to try to reach agreement we should concede two other points, which are only subsidiary matters to us,but to which the Egyptians attach importance.(f) The whole of the advance payment should be insecurities instead of - as we have been asking - 8 millions in cash and the rest in securities.(g) We should be prepared to hold the securities for upto one year before selling them, compared withour present proposal to hold  8 millions for sixmonths and the rest for a year and Egypt&apos;s counterproposal for two years.(Taking into account the cash release to Egypt of  23 millions - out ofwhich she has to meet  6 millions for pre-zero contracts - and thepayment in respect of compensation of  35 millions, there would thenremain blocked in the No. 2 Account approximately  20 millions.)7.      The position thus reached in the negotiations was discussed at ameeting of Ministers specially concerned.     It was felt that we shouldnot be giving up anything fundamental if we were to accept thesemodifications of the draft Agreement, and that we should not be justifiedin taking the risk that failing progress on these lines the negotiations would be likely to run into heavy weather.     Proposal (a) in paragraph 6would represent no change.     Proposal (b) would give us a pledge thatwe had not expected to secure.     Proposal (c) reflects a contention bythe Egyptians which we have thought we should have to admit, i. e. that compensation to cover the cost of making good United Kingdom propertysituated in Egypt should be paid in Egyptian currency (the remittancerights referred to in paragraph 5(iv) above will therefore be all themore important).     Proposal (d) is consequential on (c).    We have expected that we should have to concede something like (e) -supplementary releases from the remaining Egyptian sterling balancesonce Egypt has met our claims.     This proposal would, indeed, giveEgypt some incentive to dispose of our claims quickly and satisfactorily.Proposals (f) and (g) involve some complications of financial procedure which, however, we should be prepared to accept.8.      It is a necessary part of this scheme that Shell&apos;s claims shouldbe negotiated separately by the Company.     The reason is that these claims are so large that they would swamp any scheme designed to suit the rest.    But Shell have already been in touch with the egyptian government and are confident that they can come to terms.    Therewould be a suitable reference in the inter-governmental agreement tothe settlement reached between the Company and the Egyptian Govern-ment.9.      On the other hand we felt that:-(a) our proposals taken together might be regarded asweighted in favour of the owners of Egyptianisedproperty (mainly but not wholly large concerns)
compared with the owners of the sequestrated propertywho command greater sympathy;  and(b)    the terms on which Egypt is ready to accept neutralevaluation - only for claims exceeding  500,000 andin cases where the difference between the British and egyptian assessments is more than 15 per cent -are unduly restrictive.As to (a) - the delegation had themselves suggested that they should try to get the Egyptians to agree that a total payment of, say,  35 millions should be allocated in the proportion of,   say,  25 millions in respect ofthe Egyptianised property and  10 millions in respect of damage tosequestrated property rather than  30 millions to the former and 5 millions to the latter.    As to (b) we thought the delegation should press for better terms.10. The delegation were therefore given authority to explore, without commitment, the possibility of an agreement including the modificationsset out at (a) to (g) in paragraph 6 above, subject to trying for:-(a) the allocation of a larger part of any total payment by the Egyptians to sequestrated property, e. g. , 10 millions instead of  5 millions;   and(b) less restrictive limits on the claims which will besubject to neutral evaluation.11.     The new proposals were put to the Egyptians at a meeting on1st March.    They were told that the whole must be regarded as apackage in which our concessions balanced what we were asking from them.    A copy of a paper handed to the Egyptians is attached.     the egyptians did not raise objection except about the extent of the&quot;supplementary releases&quot; of sterling.     They said, however, that theproposals would have to be put to President Nasser personally.    the talks were adjourned for that purpose.12. The United States authorities are being kept informed.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S. VV. 1.3rd March, 195G.
SECRET .ANNEX *A-VIESTOMDNTS TO DRAFT AGREEMENTNote by the United Kingdom DelegationThe United Kingdom delegation are submitting this paper as &quot;before without commitment for the purpose of clarifyingcertain comments and proposals made in discussion.Draft Exchange of Notes on Governmental Claims2.      The Egyptian delegate has said that the Draft Exchangeof Notes is not acceptable.      In view of this the UnitedKingdom delegation are prepared to withdraw it and to re\ertto their previous proposal that Governmental claims should &quot;bediscussed at a later stage.Comnensatj on for damage to sequestrated -property and supplementary releases from the Egyptian. No.  2 Account3*      The Egyptian representative has criticised the draft agreement on the ground that in its present form it would leave  the sum of approximately  20 millions blocked in theNo, 2 Account until a final settlement has been reached coveringevery claim by British ov/ners of sequestrated property.     he asked that the agreement should contain specific previsionsproviding for supplementary releases.I4.,      To meet this criticism the United Kingdom delegation have proposed the following alternative -(a) Article III of the Agreement should include a provisionunder which the Egyptian Government would enter into discussions with the British owners of sequestratedassets with a view to reaching agreement with them onthe steps to be taken to make good or pay compensation in respect of injury or damage suffered as the resultof the measures of sequestration and control referredto in sub-paragraph if a)  of that Article.It is to be hoped that once the British owners of thepropertjr have returned to Egypt or have had anopportunity of ascertaining the condition of their assets, a settlement can be reached by agreement betweenthem and the Egyptian Government without difficulty.If necessary however it would be prossible for particular cases to be further examined in discussion between the two Governments.(b) rlitherto the Egyptian representative has proposed an advance payment of  30 millions in respect of compensationfor Egyptianised property while the United kingdom delegation has proposed a payment of  3h. millions.The United Kingdom delegacion now propose that thereshould be a payment of  35 millions of which  25 millions would be an advance payment in respect of Egyptianisedproperty, while the remaining  10 millions would represent a deposit to be held by the United KingdomGovernment pending a settlement of compensation forsequestrated property.      Of the total sum of  35 millions, 20 millions would be paid from the No. 1 Account and 15 millions from the No. 2 Account.-1-SECRET
, . SECRET(c) As and when the Egyptian Government pays compensation for damage to sequestrated property in Egyptian pounds, thereshould be released from the deposit to the No. 2 Accountequivalent amounts in sterling up to the maximum of 10 millions.     When all claims for compensation inrespect of sequestrated assets have &quot;been settled^ anybalance of the deposit remaining should similarly be refunded to the No. 2 Account.(d) Supplementary releases from the No. 2 Account would be governed by two main provisions -(i)    the question of such.releases should be examined bythe two Governments from time to time in the lightof progress made in the assessment of compensation payable in respect of Egyptianised property.     Inthis examination Her Majesty&apos;s Government will givefavourable ccnsideration to the melting ofsupplementary releases as claims are assessed and paid,  to the extent that the amount likely to berequired to settle the remainder of the claims is less than the balances available for this purpose in the Compensation Accourrc and the No, 2 Account;(ii)    on the completion of the final assessment and payment of such claims, the arrangements forsterling releases under the Sterling ReleasesAgreement would resume their normal operation.The Egyptian Government world be entitled to animmediate release from the No. 2 Account of thatproportion of the advance payment which hadoriginated from the No. 1 Account ( 20 millions)they   would also leceive a further release of upto  20 millions on 1st January, 1959 from thefluids remaining in the No. 2 Account.5.      The United Kingdom delegation also propose that theEgyptian Government should resume discussions with the shell company and that the two Governments should take note of theresult of those discussions in an Exchange of Letters to beannexed to the inter-Governmental Agreement.OTHER POINTS6.      In addition to the main points outlined above, theUnited Kingdom delegation made a number of other comments setout below.      They emphasised that these comments should betreated as a single proposal which must be taken as a whole.Article IV     It is agreed that no portion of the advance paymentneed be made in cash.Article V       The period of one year&apos;s delay shall apply to the&apos;sale of all securities and not as at present toa portion.Article VI     The references to &quot;satisfactory settlement of outstanding matters&quot; should be deleted.
Article Till    Sub-paragraph (&quot;b) will be deleted and replaced&quot;by a clause that for amounts over  5000 thenormal exchange control rules shall applywithout discrimination.Article X Sub-paragraphs (b)  and (d)  shall remain but inthe latter the word &quot;authorise&quot; shall be deleted and replaced by &quot;shall give favourable consideration to&quot;.Article XI       The United. Kingdom are not willing to givea reciprocal guarantee.Article XII     The United Kingdom delegation understand thatthe facilities in this article will apply toclaimants themselves and to agents appointedby them.Annex A Further details will be provided by the UnitedKingdom delegation of what is implied by&quot;rights and interests&quot;.Annex B, Paragraph 6.    The maximum period of delay shouldbe one year in vier/ of the difficulties of owners -who- are now scattered in all parts ofthe world.Paragraph 7*      The introduction of adeseyuestrauion charge is unacceptable.      It isa new feature of the negotiations,  involving a considerable amount of money and would raiseconsiderable difficulties as to who shouldvalue the assets.Net income should be defined so as to remove any amb i gui ty.A charge of 5 per cent is not reasonablefor management of bank balances. The charge should not exceed 5; per cent.Annex G Paragraph 1.      The United Kingdom delegationregard it as important that recourse to neutralassessment should be open to these with smallclaims even though they are unlikely to make use of it.      In practice such claims are likelyto be settled in the earliest stages of negotiation provided for in the Annex.      Thereshould therefore be no limit in respect of theamount of the claim.      The United kingdom delegation are prepared however to limit recourse to neutial assessment to cases where the Britishand Egyptian assessments differ by more than10 per cent of the latter.Paragraph 5,      The United Kingdom delegation feel strongly that it is inequitable to require theappellant to bear the cost of neutral assessmentwithout regard to the result of the assessment.They consider that since the United KingdomGovernment and the Egyptian Government would beresponsible for the oost of the two assessors tobe appointed by them under paragraph 1, the twoGovernments should share the costs of the neutralassessor to be selected by mutual agreementbetween the two Governments.Annex D This will require further discussion.1st March, 1958 -3-S EC RET
