Annex A is a preliminary draft which I had earlier had prepared in myDepartment to indicate the possible lines of a White Paper presenting in anon-committal way the alternative approaches of the August and SeptemberPlans. The earlier parts of the paper were designedly drafted at some length both to avoid any suggestion of perfunctory treatment at this late stage and to appeal for a responsible approach to the problem. The later part of the document is, inthe circumstances in which it was prepared, necessarily even more tentative and indeed incomplete. I invite the Cabinet to read it accordingly as no more thana very rough cock-shy which may help in deciding whether to adopt or reject theWhite Paper method of testing informed opinion.T. A.

ANNEX ADRAFT WHITE PAPER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THENATIONAL INSURANCE scheme. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs study of the wider problems of provisionfor old age, which was referred to in the Gracious Speech at the opening ofthe present Session of Parliament, has now reached the point at which theGovernment considers it appropriate to put their appreciation of the positionand certain provisional decisions before the country.2. Provision for old age is a question of general public concern of theutmost importance to the community as a whole. It has also the personalconcern of each individual citizen throughout his or her life. At present everycitizen has positive obligations and positive rights as an individual under thenational system of provision through National Insurance and national assistance. Many and they are an increasing number have rights and obligations under other forms of provision as well. It is because this questionaffects every individual^ personal interests and arrangements that theGovernment considers that it is dangerous and wrong to treat it from apartisan point of view or as if some doctrinaire solution could be privatelyworked out in detail and imposed on the public.3. There is a further reason for a deliberate and careful national approach to the complex questions involved in making provision for old age. Long-term planning is the essence of such provision. Unless legislation on thissubject commands the widest possible measure of confidence and assent, theprovision on which people rely will be exposed to the constant fluctuationsof political change. It was on such a basis of wide public support, reachedafter deliberate consideration both by expert opinion from all points of view and by the nation as a whole, that the present scheme of National Insurancewas established in 1948. Without such prior debate and acceptance on anational non-partisan basis, plans for further improvement, howeveringenious, will not operate successfully, and the provision they offer will notform a continuous and reliable feature of our national life.4. Much new evidence, showing profound changes in our social andeconomic structure, has become available since the present scheme ofNational Insurance was prepared. The Report by Lord Beveridge, fromwhich the present scheme took its shape, had to be based on a projection ofthe state of the nation as it was before the war. To take one obvious example,no census figures later than those of 1931 were then available. Since the war,the whole economic climate has altered. Full employment is not only a generally accepted object of national policy, but has been attained to an extent which it would have been bold to expect in 1946. The general standard ofliving is higher than any cautious person considering the state of affairs duringor immediately after the war could have dared to hope.5. The Phillips Committee on the Economic and Financial Problems of provision for Old Age, which reported in 1954, provided a valuable interimsurvey, but they too were hampered by lack of information on vitaldevelopments, particularly those relating to occupational pension schemes andI.-INTRODUCTION53232b
the pattern of incomes among older people. The National Advisory&apos;Committee on the Employment of Older Men and Women also drew attentionto these gaps in our knowledge. These gaps have now been filled. On behalfof the Government, the Government Actuary has carried out the valuablesurvey of occupational pension schemes in private industry and commerce the results of which were published on .   this gives us, for the first time, the facts about the remarkable advances which havebeen made in this field in recent years. Our knowledge of the income patterns of older people has also been much enlarged by the Household BudgetSurveys recently published by the Ministry of Labour.6. Adequate information on these issues takes time to collect and to assess. It would have been wrong, in the Governments view, for them toattempt to form even preliminary judgments until this had been done.7. The Government considers that the way is now open for fruitfuldiscussion and debate and they are therefore putting forward preliminaryconclusions before settling, for incorporation in legislation, more detailed proposals which will represent further improvements in the provision for old age. They therefore intend to open discussions on the basis of thesepreliminary findings with those who speak for employers and workers andthose who, as trustees or otherwise, have the responsibility for pension funds.They have no doubt that they will draw valuable help both from these consultations and from the general expressions of public opinion to whichthey hope discussion of the issues raised will give rise.8. This initiative springs from the Governments view of its nationalresponsibilities and is taken in no partisan spirit. The Government hope thatthe invitation to all concerned to express their views freely and frankly in the consultations it is proposed to open will be accepted in the same way. Allexperience is that building to last in this field takes time and that time takenin discussion is well spent. The Government is convinced that it is only onsuch foundations that workable and reliable advances can be made.II.-THE PRESENT position the Problem9. The basic problem of old age in this country has now long beenfamiliar. In 1911 one in 15 of the total population was a man of 65 or over ora woman of 60 or over. To-day the proportion is about one in seven. In 1979it is likely to be about one in five. At the same time progressively greaterprovision has been made by corporate effort both publicly and privately tosecure steadily better standards in old age. These efforts have been made by government action through the development of National Insurance, and byschemes built up by employers in collaboration with their employees, as wellas by individuals and groups through the Life Assurance industry.The National Scheme: an area of agreement10. Since 1926, when contributory pensions were first introduced, it hasbeen generally agreed social policy that the old should, within the resources available, be assured a basic inome through a national contributory scheme.Since the war it has become a natural aspiration that with increases in national wealth this income which old people receive as of right through the state should not only be maintained against inflationary pressure, but should beincreased in real terms as opportunity permits. On three occasions since theend of the war pensions in payment have in fact been increased in this way:in 1946, when the weekly rate was raised from 10s\ (single) 20y. (married) to
26s. (single) and 42s. (married); in 1954, when new rates of 40s. (single) and65s. (married) were fixed; and in the Act which has recently brought into effect the rates of 5G\y. (single) and 80\y. (married). Interim increases were also madein 1951 and 1952 to maintain the real value of pensions in payment.11. Ever since its introduction the national contributory pension has been,in principle, a flat-rate payment in old age, as a return for the payment offlat-rate contributions. Since 1948 this pension at improving standards hasbeen combined with the other benefits of National Insurance into a singlescheme, and contribution for it has been compulsory for nearly everyone ofworking age except married women.12. The basis of financing it has been tripartite, that is to say the costhas been shared between individual employers, individual insured persons, andtaxpayers as a whole through the Exchequer. To the extent that the annual income from the regular contributions provided by law from these threesources, plus the interest on reserves built up, does not meet the annual costof the benefits, there is a deficit. This deficit is underwritten by the taxpayer,who thus has a residual liability for the scheme, as well as a current one.Because the number of pensioners is rising, and will continue to rise for manyyears to come, while the number of contributors will remain about the same,this deficit will undoubtedly have to be met, and in coming years will on thepresent basis amount to very large annual sums.13. That strain on this account has not already begun to show itself isdue partly to sustained full employment, which has meant low expenditureon unemployment benefit, maximum yield in contributions, and a highincidence of postponed retirement from work. But the chief reason has beenthat progressive increases in benefit rates have been accompanied by increases in some cases more than proportionate in the flat-rate contributions paidby employers and insured persons, and the related Exchequer supplements.14. Originally an acceptable basis for fixing the flat-rate contribution wasto take the sum that would produce the benefits if it was paid weekly from theage of 16 and accumulated at interest. That it was not in fact accumulated ina fund did not matter. The calculation was generally accepted as fair, and itclearly linked benefits to contributions so that it could be plainly seen that arise in the rate of one had to be accompanied by a rise in the rate of the other.15. It is obvious, however, that contributions on this basis, even ifincreased on the same basis when benefits were raised, could not provideenough future income if benefit rights earned from the lower contributions of the past were put up at the same time. Those who were already pensionersreceived increased rates although they paid no more contributions: and indeedeveryone over 16 had, at each increase, some improvement in his prospectiverights for which, from an insurance point of view, he would never pay in full.16. As a partial remedy, it has been necessary to make additions fromtime to time to the contributions, over and above the &quot;actuarial&quot; age-16amount appropriate to the current rate of benefit. Even when account istaken, however, of the extra income produced by these additions to theactuarial contribution, the cost to the taxpayer of the present national insurance scheme, which this year will be about  140 millions, may exceed 400 millions a year within the next decade, and may approach  600 millions a year in twenty years&apos; time. In face of this prospect, the Government have accordingly made it one of their objectives to find means of placing theNational Insurance scheme on a sounder financial footing. If the national scheme degenerates from its contributory basis into a substantially tax-
supported system, which would be hard to distinguish from national assistance, the objectives of helping all pensioners to maintain, and if possibleimprove their standards with the march of industrial progress will be thwarted,and the conception of benefit as of right will be undermined.Occupational Schemes: A National Asset17. The movement towards pension provision through employment hasbeen one of the major features of post-war industrial society. In 1936 only just over \\ million people outside the public services were in pension schemesconnected with their work, which was usually of a traditionally permanentkind, such as the railways, the supply of electricity or gas, banking, and insurance.18. The survey of occupational pension schemes recently published bythe Government Actuary, which is the first such enquiry for twenty-two years,shows that a year ago there were more than 6j- million people in industry and commerce who belong to pension schemes, or 4J millions more than in 1936.This is apart from pensionable employees in the public services and localgovernment. If they are included, the total membership of pension schemesother than the universal National Scheme approaches 9 millions, or more thanone-third of the total working population. Of men, nearly one-half of thetotal employed belong to such schemes. One of the most encouraging features of this impressive development is the progressive extension of coverage frommanagerial and clerical to manual workers. This marks a change which isnot only a function of full employment and improved relationships in industry,but has profound social importance.19. Possibly no two occupational schemes are exactly the same in theirrules or their benefits. They have grown up to suit the needs of particular groups and usually represent the outcome of industrial negotiation. In mostthe employees contribute as well as the employer, but many are paid forentirely by employers. Some provide fixed benefits, others relate benefits toaverage salary. Some provide pensions of up to two-thirds of working pay,while others aim at only a modest addition to National Insurance and theindividual^ own resources. Similarly the rules and conditions of schemes are highly variegated to take account of the circumstances in which each scheme has developed.20.   These schemes, however, have three common features:  (1) They provide cover which is more closely adapted to the individual and his employment than any universal scheme can be.(2) They are pledges of an improved and self-supporting standard of livingfor an increasing section of the population in old age.(3) Their funds form a major part of national saving for investment, andthus help to create the real assets on which the future standard ofliving of the old must depend.21. It is clear that occupational schemes now form so important a feature of both the economy and provision for old age, that no proposals inthe latter field can ignore them. It may be that their development has now reached a stage at which more systematic provisions than those which havehitherto allowed them the maximum freedom of growth should be applied tothem. On the other hand such provisions should not be such that their continued growth might be impeded.
III.-THE FOUNDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTAn Alternative Financial Basis for Social Security -22. The above analysis suggests that the present flat rate weekly contribu-tion by itself does not afford a sound financial basis for future developmentof State pension provision and, in particular, there is need for a more buoyantsource of revenue than the flat rate contributions of employer and employedgiving rise to deficits to be met on an ever-increasing scale by the Exchequer.23. Continued reliance on general taxation would amount to drawing ablank cheque on the future. It would also undermine the protection givento the individual by the fact that the benefits he receives are based on thecontributions he personally makes. The principle of guaranteeing benefitsby financing them through funds into which contributions for this particularpurpose are paid is observed by all countries, including even communist countries, where social security has been developed. The Government haveno hesitation in rejecting tax-financed social security, even as a temporary expedient, as dangerous in itself, and likely to be unacceptable to the people as a whole, who believe in paying their way.24. There is thus need for the introduction of a system of graduated contributions by employer and employed (and possibly self-employed) either as an extension or as a modification of the existing flat-rate scheme. Theadministrative problems of such a change from our present system shouldnot be underestimated. The present apparatus of insurance cards and weeklystamps, for instance, with which everyone is familiar, would have to beprofoundly modified. The position of the self-employed and those who atpresent pay contributions, but have no earned income, would have to beconsidered afresh. New types of benefit formula would be needed; and therewould be many other problems. These practical problems have now been sufficiently examined for the Government to be satisfied that from a technical point of view such a change is practicable.25. The Government is, however, convinced that there are importantfeatures of the present scheme of National Insurance which are valuable andmust be preserved. Chief among these is the principle already referred to,that the benefits of the individual contributor should be related to the contribu-tions he has himself made.26. Secondly, the sharing of the contribution for employed personsbetween them and their employers on a broadly equal basis is as readilypossible under a graduated as under a flat-rate system, and should remain a cardinal feature of National Insurance.27. Similarly, the Exchequer should continue to play a clearly-definedpart in the support of the National Scheme by payments from general revenue and to concentrate its support on a basic level of benefit.Occupational Schemes28. The Government is convinced that no changes in the field of national insurance should be allowed to hamper the free and vigorous developmentof independent provision for old age, whether through occupational schemesor otherwise. This form of provision holds out the prospect, on terms suited to the needs and preferences of different workers and industries, of a morecomfortable maintenance in old age for the majority of the working population. Here the Government, has in mind not only the valuable rightsof members of existing schemes, but the future possibilities of development inthis field.   Such schemes are. the joint achievement of the two sides of53232
industry in fruitful negotiation, and the savings they represent are a vitarpart of national capital.Summary of Principles29. The principles therefore on which the. Government considers thedevelopment of National Insurance pension provision should be founded areas follows:  (1) Some graduation of contributions related to earnings.(2) Full safeguards for existing and potential occupational provision.(3) Pension rights related to contribution records on an individual basis.(4) Sharing of these contributions between employers and employed.(5) Concentration of Exchequer support on basic level of pensions.IV.-PROBLEMS TO BE RESOLVED AND POSSIBLE LINESOF PROGRESS30. While, in the Governments view, the above principles represent a framework on which a satisfactory advance in National pension provisioncan be established, there are some points of principle which remain to besettled.  The following paragraphs deal with these matters.The Problem of Dimensions31. It is not, in the Governments view, for the State to compel eachcitizen to contribute for more than an adequate minimum provision in old age. How he spends or allocates his income during his working life in other respects is not a matter in which the State should interfere. An attempt to depart from this would undermine the individual^ sense of responsibility and involve existing occupational schemes and their members in grave diffi-culties. The development of such schemes would be stunted and manyexisting ones, to which their members attach so much importance, mighthave to be abandoned as too difficult to keep up alongside the State scheme.The dimensions of the State scheme are thus of critical importance. the compulsory contribution should be limited to that portion of earnings whichis consistent with a reasonable scale of graduated benefits representingadequate minimum provision, in return for a moderate percentage contri-bution. The limitation of the percentage contribution to earnings up to a figure somewhat- but not very far above average industrial earnings for menand women respectively is probably the appropriate level. Up to this limita contribution of the order of 8 or 9 per cent, shared between employer and employee would provide a satisfactory basic benefit structure. With earnings of  10 a week the contribution for an employed man and his employer onthis basis would be of the order of 9.y. each; and with earnings of  15 a week,of the order of 13$. each. It might be desirable to provide a minimumcontribution.The Benefit Structure for Long-Term Benefits32. Graduated contributions could be used to support flat-rate benefitsbut where widely different amounts of contribution produce the same benefits,such a system might make the connection between the individual^contribution record and the benefits he received too remote. A number of graduated benefit structures are obviously possible. One would be to pay abasic rate of benefit where the average record of contributions reached acertain level say, that required on  400 a year for men or  300 for women;and to provide a scale of graduated benefits for contributions on earnings between this level and say  750 a year ( 650 a year for women) beyond whichlevel further contributions would not be payable.
$ 20633. This scale could be arranged to harmonise with the exchequer support of the basic rate, by applying a part of the contributions made on earnings above  400 a year (men) and  300 a year (women) towards the basicbenefits of these better-off subscribers. The effect of doing this in theindividual case would be that the higher the earnings of the contributor, theless would be the Exchequer subsidy towards his own benefits. Thus a person who consistently earned the highest amount on which contributions werepayable would be paying the full cost of the pension he received, includingthe basic portion.34. It is obvious, however, that such a benefit structure, though it would preserve the contributory principle of relating the individuals benefits to hiscontributions, could not be described as actuarial, nor as comparable to anoccupational scheme of the kind found in industry. It would, in essence,result in a reshaping and expansion of the present National Scheme on a graduated basis in which the contributions and the subsidy provided fromgeneral taxation would be redistributed in favour of those at the lower levels of earnings. For these reasons it would not, in the Governments view, bepossible to arrange for occupational schemes to contract out of any part of ascheme so constructed.35. An alternative arrangement would be to superimpose on the existingflat-rate structure graduated contributions and pensions on earnings betweensay  10 and  15 a week. The. graduated contributions and pensions could then be brought into strict actuarial relationship with each other, and member-ship of this part of the scheme would not have to be compulsory where thecontributor was in employment which carried membership of a satisfactoryoccupational scheme.An Option to Contract Out36. Clearly any extension of the State pension scheme carrying graduated contributions by employers and employees and graduated pension benefitsbeyond those of the existing flat-rate scheme, raises the question whether those already satisfactorily covered by occupational schemes should be left with no way of avoiding additional charges, which may become burdensome, in orderto provide additional pensions which may appear unnecessary, except by cutting down the contributions and benefits of the occupational schemes; orwhether there should not be the alternative of contracting out of the extensionof the State scheme where the occupational scheme satisfies certain conditions.Many schemes in industry as well as of the public services are as sound as any State provision, and, subject to certain adaptations in respect ofpreservation of rights on change of employment could, if the way were left open, be alternatives to an extension of the State provision for those whobelong to them.37. This problem is one to which the Government has devoted a greatdeal of attention.. It has, as already indicated, a bearing on the structure ofthe State scheme. Contracting out, to be feasible, would require a two-tieredState system comprising a universal basic tier on present lines with fiat ratebenefits supported by Exchequer contribution or subsidy and an upper tierunsubsidised by the Exchequer with graduated contributions earning graduated pensions on an actuarial basis. Such a second tier would afford the necessarybasis for comparison with the provisions of occupational pension schemes which wished to be contracted out of it in respect of their members.
- 20?   m-38. The consideration which the Government has given to this mattersuggests that the following arrangements and conditions for contracting out would be appropriate:  (a) Applications. Contracting-out would be on the application of an employer acting with the consent of trustees, if any, of his pensions scheme, to an independent registrar whose duty it would be to seethat the scheme complied with certain broad criteria to be laid down.There would be no individual option on the part of the individual member of a contracted-out scheme to belong to the State graduated scheme.(b) Equivalency. It would be necessary for the employer to show that thetotal weekly contribution (employer and worker together) under the occupational scheme in respect of pensions reached a prescribed levelof, say, 4s. a week, i.e., the graduated contribution payable under theState scheme in respect of a worker in the middle of the graduatedscale. The registrar would have discretion to take account of the con-tributions paid for any long-term benefits, including widows&apos; benefits,and of payments made by the employer to the scheme otherwise thanon a week by week basis, e.g., payments in respect of back servicerights, or to keep the scheme solvent. In other cases, including non-contributory schemes, an alternative test of equivalency of benefits would be applied.(c) Solvency. The registrar would have to be satisfied that the employerwas legally liable to make contributions under the scheme sufficient,with the contributions if any from the employees, to keep it solvent.The contributions would have to be alienated from the employer.Schemes would have to submit periodically returns and valuations toshow that the conditions continued to be satisfied, the precise natureof the requirement depending on whether the scheme was self-administered or insured.(rf) Preservation of pension rights. The occupational scheme would haveto provide, on change of employment, for preservation of that part ofpension rights which had been accepted as equivalent to those of theState graduated scheme. Where more substantial pension provision was made in an occupational scheme the whole of this need not betransferable. It would be open to the employer to adjust his scheme in such a way that during an initial period of service employeesremained covered by the State graduated scheme thus avoiding thedifficulty of preserving rights however short the period of service. Asa transitional measure, pending the development of preservationarrangements in schemes applying for contracting out, an undertakingmight be accepted from the employer that in the event of a workerleaving his employment during, say, the first three years of the new arrangement he would pay a transfer value to the State scheme to givethat worker equivalent rights in that scheme. Contributions due to bereturned to the employee in such a case could be applied for thispurpose.39. The Government have given most earnest consideration to thesequestions and to the many administrative problems which would arise onan option of this kind. That they would be complex is evident from the survey of occupational pension schemes recently conducted by the Govern-ment Actuary. Nevertheless the Government would wish to provide for contracting out and to frame the State scheme accordingly if there were asufficient indication from those concerned with occupational pension schemes
(    juia208fiat such a provision was desirable in the interests of the sound developmentof those schemes. On the other hand, it may be that a single tier universalscheme which, while not able to accommodate contracting out, remainedlimited to the dimensions indicated in paragraph 31, would not seriously prejudice the development of occupational schemes.Problems of Special Classes40. The Self-Employed. A graduated scheme need not necessarilyextend to the self-employed, who could remain compulsorily insurable forminimum benefits in old age in return for flat-rate contributions, as at present.The taxation concessions of 1956 have made it easier than it used to be forthe self-employed to arrange provision in old age for themselves onadvantageous terms. On the other hand the self-employed, particularly those with more modest incomes, might benefit from inclusion in a graduated Stateinsurance scheme.41. Persons not Gainfully Occupied. Under the present scheme allpersons of working age (except married women), even if not gainfullyemployed, are liable for National Insurance contributions, and receive, inconsequence, both the Exchequer supplement paid from general taxation andthe advantage from the public underwriting of deficiencies arising from benefit increases. For the comparatively few persons of independent means who(though of working age) have no gainful occupation, the receipt of aconcealed Exchequer subsidy of this kind may seem a superfluous provision.For the remainder of those not gainfully occupied for instance the student,the unmarried daughter keeping house for her parents, and those who haveretired on modest superannuation for reasons of health before reaching theNational Insurance pension ages the existing scheme recognises that a compulsory contribution may represent real hardship unless it can be excusedon grounds of low income. If the contributions to the State scheme were based on earnings the question arises whether principle would still require that a compulsory contribution should be levied where no earnings are received, or whether in such cases insurance might not be voluntary.[Among other problems which might have to be included in a White paper would be that of the treatment of women, particularly married women.]Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,London, W.C. 2,31st March, 1958.
ANNEX BSuggested Working Document for Informal and Confidential Discussions onContracting OutThe following gives an outline of a possible development of the national insurance Scheme.Contributions2. The existing flat-rate contributions would continue to be payable wherethey are payable as at present.For men earning more than  10 a week there would be an additional ccntri-bution of, say, 4 per cent, a side on their earnings between  10 and  15 a week. for employed women the figures of  8 and  13 might be substituted for  10 and  15respectively.No graduated contribution would be payable by self-employed or non-employed persons.Benefits3. In respect of people not liable for graduated contributions benefits would continue as at present. In respect of the graduated contributions additional pension benefits would be provided on a money purchase basis. Thus, assuming a basis of3 per cent, interest, a man who entered the scheme at minimum age who paid themaximum contributions throughout life [i.e., on  15 a week) would qualify for anadditional pension of  3 a week on top of the existing National Insurance standard rate.Contracting Out4. Men earning more than  10 a week (women over  8 a week) who were in occupational pension schemes which satisfied certain criteria could be contracted out of the liability to pay graduated contributions. Contracting out would be onthe application of an employer acting with the consent of trustees, if any, of his pension scheme, to an independent registrar whose duty it would be to see that thescheme complied with certain broad criteria to be laid down. There would beno individual option on the part of the individual member of a contracted-outscheme to belong to the State graduated scheme.Proposed Criteria for Contracting Out(a) Equivalency5. It would be necessary for the employer to show that the total weekly outlay(employer and worker together) under the occupational scheme in respect of long-term benefits reached a prescribed level of, say, 4s. a week, i.e., the graduated contributions payable under the State scheme in respect of a worker in the middle ofthe graduated scale. The registrar would have discretion to take account of thecontributions paid for any long-term benefits, including widows&apos; benefits, and ofpayments made by the employer to the scheme otherwise than on a week by weekbasis, e.g., payments in respect of back service rights, or to keep the scheme solvent.In other cases, including non-contributory schemes, an alternative test ofequivalency of benefits would be applied.(b) Solvency6. The registrar would have to be satisfied that the employer was legally liableto make contributions under the scheme sufficient, with the contributions if any fromthe employees, to keep it solvent. The contributions would have to be alienatedfrom the employer. Schemes would have to submit periodically returns andvaluations to show that the conditions continued to be satisfied, the precise natureof the requirement depending on whether they were self-administered or insured.
(c) Preservation of Pension Rights7. The occupational scheme would have to provide on change of employment for preservation of that part of pension rights which had been accepted as equivalentto those of the State graduated scheme. Where more substantial pension provision was made in an occupational scheme the whole of this need not be transferable. Itwould be open to the employer to adjust his scheme in such a way that during an initial period of service employees remained covered by the State graduated schemethus avoiding the difficulty of preserving rights however short the period of service.As a transitional measure, pending the development of preservation arrangements inschemes applying for contracting out, an undertaking might be accepted from the employer that in the event of a worker leaving his employment during, say, the first three years of the new arrangement he would pay a transfer value to the State schemeto give that worker equivalent rights in that scheme. Contributions due to bereturned to the employee in such a case could be applied for this purpose.8. It is desired to obtain [from those consulted] informed comment on how a contracting-out option of the kind indicated above would be viewed by those responsible for occupational pension schemes and how far in order to avail them-selves of it they would be likely to adapt schemes.31st March, 1958.
