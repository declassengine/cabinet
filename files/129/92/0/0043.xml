H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,2nd May, 1958.secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC M.\JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
MEMORANDUM  BY THE ECONOMIC STEERING  committee we have considered the attached report by an inter-Departmental working party of officials of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Commonwealth Relations Office,Board of Trade and Ministry of Agriculture on the application made by the NewZealand Government for the imposition of anti-dumping or counter-vailing duties on butter imported into the United Kingdom from Sweden, Finland and the irish republic.   This application was supported by Denmark and Kenya.2. We feel that there is no case, on strictly economic merits, for taking any unilateral action, notwithstanding the finding that exports from the countries concerned have been subsidised and that material injury has thereby been caused to the New Zealand dairy industry. The butter problem is a world-wide difficultyarising from over-production (stimulated by excessive prices to producers) andunder-consumption, and can only be solved by concerted international action.The United Kingdom Government cannot itself, by economic sanctions, correct the world imbalance; this must be done by changes in the policies of supplying countries. International action, in which we have taken our full part, has already made a very promising start in the Organisation for European economic co-operation, and there are grounds for believing that it will lead to a satisfactory solution of the problem. Any action resulting in an increase in butter prices ora restriction of imports into the United Kingdom from New Zealand *s competitorswould be against the long-term economic interests not only of this country butalso of New Zealand. Such action against those countries only might well mean that the butter excluded from the United Kingdom would be directed to othermarkets and thus free additional supplies from, say, Denmark, Holland or theCommonwealth for export to the United Kingdom. Any increase in the price of butter could only encourage a switch from butter to margarine. So far as thiscountry&apos;s interests are concerned, drastic action in this field might have far-reachingeffects on the United KingdoirTs commercial relations, and would tend to increasethe import bill and the cost of living.3. On the other hand, we recognise that it would be impossible, in practice,simply to take no action on the New Zealand request. The problem is a livelypolitical issue in New Zealand; the existence of the Customs Duties (Dumpingand Subsidies) Act is well known there, and it has been represented to theCommonwealth as available for their help in appropriate cases. The NewZealanders feel that they have made out their case for action under it. Moreover,discussions have already started with New Zealand representatives regarding the revision of the Ottawa Agreement. They have made a number of extremedemands for reducing United Kingdom preferences in the New Zealand marketvery sharply. Refusal to help on butter would make it even more difficult to reach a satisfactory issue in these negotiations. Finally, the New Zealand Deputy PrimeMinister, Mr. Skinner, is now in London specifically to negotiate on the butterproblem. It would be very difficult, on political and other grounds, to send himback empty-handed4. It is against the above background that we have examined the proposals set out in the Working Party&apos;s report. We feel that they are all open to weightyobjections, as follows:  (i) Imposing a counter-vailing dutyThere can be no doubt that the Government are legally entitled to take action under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. But to doso in this particular instance would open up the very grave difficulties set outin paragraphs 7-13 of the report. There can be no certainty where thisslippery slope might end, particularly as New Zealand has it in mind to makecomplaints against other countries if her present request gets favourable treatment. Duties cannot be imposed to protect an industry in a third country without the concurrence of the Contracting Parties to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). It would be unwise to underestimate thearduous and embarrassing discussions which would ensue in the GATT,particularly as these might lead to complaints that other countries were usingsubsidies in relation to butter and milk products generally, including NewZealand itself on cheese. The effect on our relations with the Irish Republic not a member of the GATT might be very serious.  Moreover, given the
need to go to the GATT and the inevitable troubles with the Irish Republic,invocation of the Act would not be a speedy process and might not pay anydividends in the negotiations on the Ottawa Agreement.(ii) Export LimitationThis solution is examined in paragraphs 14-18 of the report. Its maindrawback is that, apart from the possibility that it may not be regarded assufficiently generous by New Zealand, there&apos; is no certainty that the countries concerned could be persuaded to agree to a voluntary limitation of their exports. They would need to be convinced that, if they did not accept a voluntary limitation, the United Kingdom would have no hesitation inimposing duties unilaterally. Thus, the final result might be that, after several months&apos; fruitless negotiation with the countries concerned, the UnitedKingdom would be compelled to have recourse to counter-vailing duties. in short, therefore, this is not a true alternative to (i) above, since it involves a clearreadiness on the part of the United Kingdom to take action under the Act.Moreover, because of the length of time which the operations would take, itwould not help in the negotiations on the Ottawa Agreement.(iii) Financial AssistanceParagraphs 22 and 23 of the report examine the idea of the UnitedKingdom Government making a contribution to the New Zealand DairyIndustry Account. This is a fund operated by the New Zealand dairy industry itself, and is used to make up to New Zealand producers the difference betweenthe export price of butter and the price guaranteed them by their Government.The New Zealand Government is under a legal obligation to underwrite the account and to make up any deficiency. At the present rate of expenditure(some  16 millions a year) the Account will shortly be exhausted. A directpayment by the United Kingdom Government to this fund might well havea significant appeal to the New Zealand Government. But for the UnitedKingdom Exchequer to make a direct subvention to a Commodity Board in a commonwealth country might set a damaging precedent. Other primaryproducing countries might interpret the United kingdom&apos;s reluctance toproceed under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act in this instance as showing that the Government were prepared to compound withcomplainants for cash and might accordingly come forward with requests forassistance. Such a payment, by its nature, would impose a burden on theUnited Kingdom balance of payments without giving us any assurance ofbenefit in return, e.g., by way of increased exports. Moreover, Exchequerassistance to an individual industry in a Commonwealth country would be contrary to the pattern established in relation to Colonial primary producingindustries which are in difficulties. Finally, any such payment would require legislation.5. In the light of the foregoing, we decided that the best approach to this difficult problem was to search for the solution likely to be least injurious to thelong-term interests of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. We feel that therecommendation made in the following paragraphs satisfies this requirement. Thisrecommendation is, however, subject to a reservation by the commonwealth relations Office representative, who considered that it would not be adequate tomeet the New Zealand Government^ political difficulties, and that any financialoffer should be linked with the butter problem. He preferred, therefore, a solution on the lines of (iii) above.recommendation. Either (ii) or (iii) above is preferable to (i); but both in our view (subject tothe reservation by the Commonwealth Relations Office) are open to such serious objection as to be unacceptable. We recommend therefore that the New zealand government should be offered a short-term credit under Section 3 of the export guarantees Act. This would have the following advantages:  (a) It would be consonant with recently agreed, and announced, government policy to provide stabilising loans to Commonwealth countries in the sterling area as a means of combining the objectives of assisting both
United Kingdom exports and Commonwealth countries in temporaryforeign exchange difficulties. As such, it would be part of an existing and coherent policy, and would not be a new departure.(b) The credit could be extended quickly with the minimum of formalities; itwould not require legislation. It could therefore be expected to exercise a good effect on the current negotiations about the Ottawa Agreement.Indeed, the provision of the credit might be made conditional upon theNew Zealand representatives in the trade negotiations not pressing theirmore extreme proposals.(c) As the loan would be tied to United Kingdom exports, it could be expectedto pay a useful dividend to this country. It could not, either in form orin fact, be represented as a subsidy to New Zealand producers.(d) Since it would not be linked with the butter problem, but would beprovided to the New Zealand Government for general purposes, itwould not establish a precedent for attempts by other overseas industries in difficulties to extract cash assistance from the United kingdom excequer. On the other hand, there would be no objection to theNew Zealand Government relating it, for their own purposes, to theirbutter difficulties.(e) It would help to tide New Zealand over a difficult problem while she isputting into effect more rational internal policies and while international action on the butter problem is proceeding.7. We recognise that, in paragraph 21 of their report, the Working Party took the view that the objection to this course was that, since the assistance would not be specifically directed to butter, it would not induce New Zealand to refrain from pressing for action on the butter problem. While we agree that this proposal isprobably not as favourable as New Zealand would like, we feel that it has areasonable chance of acceptance if Mr. Skinner is:  (a) given a frank and detailed explanation of the dangers and difficulties of anyother course particularly the imposition of counter-vailing duties both for New Zealand and the United Kingdom;(b) told firmly that the United Kingdom Government is not prepared to contemplate any of these courses;(c) told that the United Kingdom Government would be prepared to extenda credit of, say,  5 millions, as a supplement to the  20 millions loanrecently raised by New Zealand in the London market, in the hope thatthis will enable New Zealand to modify her internal policies in sucha way as to reap the maximum effect from the international action onbutter which is now proceeding;(d) told that a condition of the credit must be that the New zealand government should modify drastically the present proposals whichthey have put forward for the revision of the Ottawa Agreement.Time-table8. This question has aroused widespread attention in the United kingdom parliament and Press, and the timing of any public announcement will need carefulconsideration. From this standpoint the adoption of either course (i) or course(ii) above would present substantial difficulties. Before any announcement couldbe made, prior consultation with the Irish Republic would be inevitable in the caseof (i) while, in the case of (ii), at any rate preliminary soundings would need to betaken of all the Governments concerned. But neither of the other courses (at (iii)above and that recommended in paragraph 6) would involve the same difficulties,once Mr. Skinner had indicated his acceptance.May, 1958
IMPORTS OF BUTTERReport by an Inter-departmental Working Party of officials the application made by the New Zealand Government (and supported byDenmark and Kenya) for the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duties on butter imported from Sweden, Finland and the Irish Republic^ has been examined by the Tariff Division of the Board of Trade. It has been established to the board&apos;s satisfaction that butter exported from these countries is sold to theUnited Kingdom at prices below those ruling in their home market and that theseexports are assisted by subsidies from State funds. The Committee of officialsestablished to consider the issue of material injury in relation to dumping andsubsidisation has also reported that these dumped or subsidised imports have beena contributory factor in causing and threatening material injury to the New Zealanddairy industry within the terms of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies)Act. More precisely, the finding is that if these countries had not sent 50,000 tonsof subsidised butter to the United Kingdom in 1957, the market would have beensteadier and to that exent New Zealand producers would have been better off inthe volume of their sales or in a slower run down in the monies belonging to themin their Dairy Industry Account. A copy of the Committee&apos;s report is appended.2. An application by the domestic dairy industry for similar duties on butterimported from Finland, Sweden, the Irish Republic and Austria has resulted ina finding that there is no material injury to the domestic industry. A separate report on this is being prepared and it will at some stage be necessary to announce the rejection of the domestic application.3. The finding being that exports from the countries concerned have beensubsidised, the appropriate form of duty under the Act would be a countervailingduty. It is now for Ministers to decide whether it is in the national interest toimpose on behalf of New Zealand countervailing duties on butter imported from sweden, Finland and the Irish Republic. Our international obligations under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provide that we must have awaiver before imposing duties on other members of the GATT (such as sweden and Finland) to protect an industry in a third country (New Zealand), but the contracting parties are obliged to grant this waiver for a countervailing duty (i.e:,a duty to offset a foreign subsidy) provided that they find that there is materialinjury, and this kind of duty (as distinct from an anti-dumping duty) may be imposed without waiting for the waiver if the emergency justifies it, subject to theduty being withdrawn should the Contracting Parties subsequently refuse a waiveron the ground that in their judgment New Zealand was not suffering or threatened with material injury. The Irish Republic is not in the GATT. Our commercialagreements with the Irish Republic do not in our view preclude us from imposing a countervailing duty on their butter, though they would almost certainly seek todispute this and would feel seriously aggrieved if we did so.4. In considering the policy issues involved, it is important to have in mind the salient facts about United Kingdom consumption of butter and margarine.These are set out in paragraphs 6-11 of the Appendix. Total consumption of butter and margarine together appears to be remarkably constant. Since decontrol butterconsumption (though still well below pre-war) has increased as more supplies have come forward and as the price has fallen in relation to that of margarine. any significant increase in the price of butter will check this trend.5.  There are four possible courses to be considered. We might (a) take no action at all;(b) impose countervailing duties;* The examination of the New Zealand application in respect of butter imported from Argentinais not yet complete. A prima facie case of subsidisation has only just been made out and the argentine government has been given until May 5th to reply to it. The complaint against Argentina involvesher use of multiple exchange rates. The references to Argentina in this paper assume that subsidisationcan be established.
(c) be ready to act as under (b), but offer the countries concerned an option to limit their exports to us;(d) offer New Zealand some form of temporary financial assistance.Whichever of these courses were followed, we should continue to join in pressing for an international solution to the difficulties which have arisen in theworld butter market. These cannot be solved by our own actions alone; they call for revision of milk production and consumption policies generally in Europe and elsewhere. Remedial action has already been initiated in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.). As examples, Sweden, denmark and Holland have already taken steps to reduce domestic butter prices, and so hasFinland; and the scope of these discussions is to be extended to the Food and agriculture Organisation (F.A.O.) in June.(a) Taking no action at all6. Viewing our interests as consumers of butter, it would suit us best to take no specific action on the New Zealand application, but leave what is a world-wideproblem of production and consumption to be solved by the concerted international action already started. But on political and other grounds, it would seem verydifficult to send Mr. Skinner, the New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and minister of Agriculture, back empty handed. Our Act exists and it has been represented to the Commonwealth as available for their help in appropriate cases.Parliament might expect to see it used, and Mr. Skinner might well argue that evenif action to help him on butter is not the whole answer, it is nevertheless a help towhich he has a justifiable claim. Moreover, discussions have just been started with new Zealand for the revision of the Ottawa Agreement. Refusal to help on butterwould make these negotiations more difficult. If we can help on butter we cangain credit for it in the Ottawa negotiations and reduce the pressures to curtail the preferences we enjoy.(b) Imposing a countervailing duty7. There are substantial difficulties and objections in the way of use of ourAct. Firstly, there are the inherent difficulties and dangers of the concept of actionto offset differences between the prices ruling in our free market and prices in producing countries if this comes to be applied to agricultural products generally.Since these are more or less standardised and produced by a number of countries,there is generally a market price which has to be accepted by any particularsupplier if he is to sell at all. And this price is determined not by the policy of oneseller, but by the interaction of total supply and the capacity of the market. Thusif we use our Act against subsidised butter we would be starting on what may prove to be a slippery slope.8. In the first place, though New Zealand has initially picked on four countries, a case could be made out against many others that the butter theysend to us is subsidised in one way or another, and we know indeed that New&apos;Zealand has complaint against others in mind. The Dutch could not refute sucha charge. The Australians would have a technical defence, which might or mightnot carry conviction internationally. Pressures might develop to extend actionagainst all these countries; and it would be difficult to satisfy the complainants(who might be among the countries against whom we were already acting) thatwe should go no further. Even though we do not export butter, the effects ofour own milk subsidies would be open to attack. Action which would be acceptedif extended to all alike might easily lead to retaliation against our exports once it were felt that we were unfairly discriminating in favour of some against others.Our need to go to the GATT for a waiver to apply countervailing duties would open the way to all these pressures and in the play of accusation and counter-accusation there could be no saying where it might all lead.9. Secondly, butter is far from alone in being subsidised; the position ismuch the same with other agricultural products. New Zealand herself, forexample, could be said, on the criteria she applies to the case of butter, to bedumping cheese. Again, wheat is overtly subsidised both by the United Statesand France; and a precedent on butter might lead to pressure from, e.g., Canadaor Australia for countervailing duties on wheat.
10. The fact is that most countries protect their own agricultural marketsin some way or other, and they often arrange to stabilise their domestic prices.Whether their export prices turn out to be lower (or indeed higher) than thesedomestic prices depends on fluctuations in world conditions and on the particular form of regulation adopted in any given case for the domestic market. Butteritself is in world surplus because so many countries subsidise their producers in one way or another. Our own production of butter is expanding, and thevolume of exports that New Zealand seeks to maintain here reflects the level of guaranteed prices paid to her own producers.11. The one special fact about butter is that it has a powerful rival inmargarine. Apart from considerations of the balance of payments on the cost ofliving, any attempt to raise butter prices significantly or hold them at predeterminedlevels is bound to affect its ability to compete with margarine.12. If Ministers decide that a duty ought to be imposed, the duty may beany amount up to but not exceeding the amount of subsidy. The maximum amountof the duty at present prices would be of the order of &apos;2s. a lb. This would beprohibitive of imports, and this would also be true of any lower duty of significantamount (say Is.) unless the price of butter rose considerably. It is quite impracticable to fix a figure for a countervailing duty which will admit areasonable quantity to the United Kingdom market but no more.13. A level of duty which completely excluded imports from the countriescomplained of would be very drastic action against the background that they are all traditional pre-war suppliers to the United Kingdom market, that othersuppliers subsidise their exports to us and that we subsidise our own producers.Such drastic action against these countries alone would be extremely damaging to our relations with Finland and Sweden and would probably be ruinous for ourrelations with the Irish Republic.(c) Export limitation14. If Ministers decided that it was in the national interest to use the Act,an alternative to actually imposing the duty would be to tell the countriescomplained of by New Zealand of the decision and the amount of duty proposed(say Is.), and give them an opportunity of limiting their exports to the UnitedKingdom to quantities representing a &quot; fair share &quot; of the United Kingdom markethaving due regard to past trade, on the understanding a duty would not then be imposed. If Sweden and Finland were prepared to accept this without challengeno reference to GATT would be required. Offered the option of generous quotas,it is perhaps unlikely that they would seek to challenge in GATT our right toimpose a duty. We cannot however be sure of this and cannot, therefore, be certain this course would avoid the risks which discussion in GATT would entail.We must anyway reckon with the possibility that these countries would press thatin equity we should ask other countries whose exports to us involve subsidies should similarly limit exports to us.15. Under this approach we should envisage asking the countries against which New Zealand has complained to limit exports to 75 per cent, of the averagequantities sent us pre-war or in the years 1955-57 whichever was higher, with the peak figure reached in 1955-57 as a ceiling. This would give the Irish Republica quota at the 1957 rate. Imports from Sweden, Finland and Argentina wouldbe cut to a figure considerably below their 1957 imports. This would cut importsfrom these countries by about 20,000 tons as compared with 1957. The formulamay seem generous, but we have had in mind two important considerations:first the need to avoid reducing imports from the Irish Republic, and secondlythe need for a formula which would allow imports at recent levels if we should find ourselves having to apply it to Australia.16. The likely effects of these proposals on the London butter market haveto be assessed against the background of our latest judgment of current markettrends. As a consequence of the recent increase in butter consumption in thiscountry and of the remedial measures which have already been taken internationally,there is a good deal more confidence in the London market. Indeed, it may be thatdespite increased quantities expected in 1958 as compared with last year from NewZealand (22,000 tons), Denmark (8,000 tons) and our own domestic production(6,000 tons), there will not be sufficient new supplies of butter in prospect to
maintain the present increased rate of consumption. The market is thus set fora rise in price and this could be sharpened by any further significant limitation ofsupplies. This, while increasing the price of New Zealand butter, would checkconsumption of butter in competition with margarine.17. Thus while the proposals are seemingly generous to the four foreigncountries and less than Mr. Skinner might want, they would be more than a tokengesture. They would under-pin the market, help to &quot; hold the ring &quot; fairly for new Zealand and would constitute an outward symbol of our willingness to help.Indeed since there is a real risk that any restrictions imposed on the four countries would have to be extended to others, the United Kingdom would be taking actionwhich would involve risks on the balance of payments and the cost of living.18. If this line of approach were approved our aim would be to get thesequotas implemented by the exporting countries. It is basic to this line that weshould be seeking limitation of supplies against the background of readiness touse our Act in the last resort. The unilateral imposition of import restrictions by ourselves would be quite different and would be open to far reaching objectionson many grounds.(d) Financial assistance19. Before examining this, reference should be made to two proposals whichthe New Zealanders themselves have mentioned we believe they may have others as alternatives to action under the Act. One is a suggestion by Mr. Ormond (a meat and not a butter man; he is in fact Chairman of the New Zealand MeatProducers&apos; Board) that New Zealand might be willing to forgo pressure for actionon butter if we could agree to introduce a substantial preference for meat. We aresatisfied that anything we could reasonably offer on meat would not have this effect.The other is a suggestion by Mr. Skinner himself that we should use the threat ofaction under our Act to force the countries sending us subsidised butter to opentheir doors to butter shipped from the United Kingdom. This would in effectamount to asking them to substitute a free market price as in the United kingdom for their existing &quot; managed market &quot; prices and would represent a radical changein their methods of supplying their farmers which it would be quite unreasonableand impracticable to seek to force upon them.20. Financial assistance could take one of three forms. Long term contractsor deficiency payments are open to many familiar objections. In our view, therefore,the choice would lie between a Section 3 loan tied to the purchase of UnitedKingdom exports to assist the general balance of payments position of New zealand and a contribution to her Dairy Industry Account.21. Whether or not it may ultimately be necessary and appropriate to considera Section 3 loan to New Zealand to aid her general balance of payments position,in supplement to the  20 millions loan she has just raised on the London market,the overwhelming objection we see to any such offer at this stage is that it wouldnot be specifically directed to butter and would not therefore, in our view, induceNew Zealand to refrain from pressing for action on butter. Moreover, NewZealand&apos;s balance of payments difficulties are in large part attributable to her owninflationary policies and further general assistance would raise a new set of issues.22. It thus seems to us that the only practical form of financial assistance would be a contribution by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the New Zealand DairyIndustry Account. This fund is near exhaustion; when that happens, the NewZealand Government is committed by law to making up the difference between theexport price of butter and the price guaranteed to their farmers, which, under existing legislation can only be reduced by a maximum of 5 per cent, a year. TheNew Zealand Government are understood to be considering amending legislation;and a contribution from us would help New Zealand over the transition to more realistic prices for butter in the longer term. We consider that it would have tobe a once for all offer, conditional upon appropriate contributions by the NewZealand Government and the New Zealand farmers. It is thought unlikely that anything less than a contribution of  5 millions from us would be effective.23. The main attractions of an arrangement on these lines are that it would help towards a more enduring solution for New Zealand, would be quick anddramatic, would avoid for us the dangers inherent in applying duties or negotiating
quotas and might be easier to play effectively in the preference negotiations. Onthe other hand it would involve a substantial subvention from the Exchequer when we are reducing subsidies to our own farmers and the need generally for economiesis paramount; we should be asking Parliament to vote a subsidy for New Zealandpartly to offset the effects of our own milk policies and partly to offset subsidisationelsewhere; and it would set a precedent for contributing elsewhere in theCommonwealth to stabilisation funds when commodity prices fall.24. Whatever action Ministers decide to take, whether a countervailing duty,negotiated quotas or a contribution to the New Zealand Dairy Industry Account,we think it would be most important for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to propose totake the lead, with active support from New Zealand and, we would hope, fromother countries, such as Denmark, to organise international action to stimulateconsumption of butter, particularly within producing countries, and to reducehigh-cost production. Action has been started in O.E.E.C., but this is inevitablyon a European scale. What is needed also is world-wide action through the F.A.O.and GATT and a United Kingdom initiative here would serve not only to helpNew Zealand, to the extent that it was successful, but also to establish our good faith in whatever protective measures we might meanwhile apply against particular countries on New Zealand&apos;s behalf.Summary25. It is clear from the foregoing analysis that there are difficulties in any ofthe courses that appear to be open to us; and we have not been able to reachagreed conclusions. On the assumption that something must be done, some of usconsider that the least disadvantageous course would be to negotiate quotas withthe four countries concerned against the background of a decision to apply duties in the last resort, these quota arrangements to be extended to other suppliers ifnecessary. There are far reaching risks in this course, but those favouring itnevertheless consider it the least disadvantageous on balance. Others considerthat in view of the difficulties and dangers attaching to any action based on ourAct, it would be preferable to decide in favour of financial assistance in the formof a once-for-all contribution, on conditions, to the New Zealand Dairy IndustryAccount.Tactics with Mr. Skinner26. Whichever course Ministers decide to take, it is suggested that they would wish to tell Mr. Skinner, in strict confidence, what they have in mind at an early stage, stress the difficulties and disadvantages to the United Kingdom of any actionrelated to butter and impress upon him, and urge him to impress upon his colleagues,the difficulties of explaining and defending the action to Parliament and publicopinion unless New Zealand will in turn refrain from pressing demands for anysubstantial reduction in the preferences we enjoy.Board of Trade, S.W.1.
B01APPENDIXIMPORTS OF BUTTERReport by Officials of the Treasury, Board of Trade, Ministry ofAgriculture and Ministry of power. The ApplicationWe have considered the application by the New Zealand Government, onbehalf of the New Zealand dairy industry, for the imposition of anti-dumping orcountervailing duties on imports into the United Kingdom of butter originating in finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic. The application also named Argentinabut as no prima facie case of dumping or subsidisation had been made out this wasnot before the Committee. The applicants claim that butter from these sources hasbeen dumped into the United Kingdom, that such dumping is continuing, that thishas caused material injury to the New Zealand dairy industry and that it threatensfurther material injury in the future. In addition, they maintain that the dumpingis brought about by Government subsidy schemes in the countries concerned.2. The application has been officially supported by Denmark and Kenya,both of whom maintain that their export trade to the United Kingdom in butterhas been damaged by dumped or subsidised imports.II. Dumping3. The evidence put before us showed that there was a substantial margin ofdumping in the case of imports from all three countries as follows:  Fair market    .        Export prices Margin ofprices in 1957: in 1957: dumping:cost per cwt. cost per cwt. cost per cwt.s. d. s. d. s. d. s. d. s. dFinland         ......             486 5 243 9 to 280 9 205 8 to 242 8Sweden         ......             444 11 224 9 to 278 3 166 8 to 220 2Irish Republic         ...             438 6 247 5 to 275 5 163 1 to 191 1It is the policy of many dairy producing countries, unlike that of New Zealand, tokeep domestic prices of butter high, with the result that home consumption isrestricted. When there is a surplus it is sold abroad. None of the three countriesnamed in the application has denied the facts of actual dumping, although all have sought to justify it on the grounds that they are merely selling abroad for what their butter will fetch on the free market. We have no evidence of deliberateintention to dump in the United Kingdom market, but this does not affect the legal position, which is related to facts and not intentions.4. The applicants claim that the ability of these countries to export buttercheaply is the result either of production or export subsidies; in the case of finland and the Irish Republic, the whole of the difference between their domestic and export prices is met by subsidy from State funds. Swedish producers benefit froma production subsidy, also from State funds. We are satisfied that the existence ofthese Government schemes has contributed to the increased production of milk,with the result that exportable surpluses of milk products have been built up.5. It was brought to our attention that some other countries in addition tothose named in the application were probably sending dumped or subsidised butterto the United Kingdom. We took note of this statement, but considered that itfell outside our terms of reference in that we were considering an application limitedto Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic.III. The United Kingdom Market6. The United Kingdom is the only substantial market in the world to allowimports of butter free of quantitative restrictions. Butter is subject to a specificduty of 15s. per cwt., imposed in 1932 under the Ottawa Agreements Act inimplementation of the Agreements with New Zealand and Australia. Thead valorem incidence of this duty is now less than 5 per cent, compared with anaverage of about 15 per cent, before the war. Butter from Commonwealth countries and the Irish Republic is admitted free of duty.
IV. Imports7. Annex A shows the pattern of imports into the United Kingdom for anumber of years both before and after the war. New Zealand, Australia and denmark are the principal suppliers of the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements. Lesserexporting countries include Finland, Sweden, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands,Argentina, Austria and Poland. Apart from the Netherlands these last-namedcountries have, since the war, provided irregular sources of supply, although some(including the countries accused of dumping) are clearly trying to re-establish their pre-war position as minor but regular suppliers. Over-production of milk in some european countries as a result of Government policies has in recent years led tothe existence of exportable surpluses for which the United Kingdom, with herabsence of import restrictions, is a natural outlet. There were virtually no importsfrom Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic after the war until 1956. In 1956imports from these sources amounted to 11,000 tons or 3 per cent, of all importsof butter into the United Kingdom; the figure had risen to 50,000 tons or over13 per cent in 1957, and has been maintained at or above this level in the first quarter of 1958. Compared with the pre-war position, however, these threesuppliers have not as yet significantly increased their exports of butter to the UnitedKingdom.8. New Zealand was the largest supplier of the United Kingdom marketbefore the war and has subsequently increased her share. Before the war she sentan annual average of 130,000 tons of butter to the United Kingdom (27 per cent,of all imports). In 1956 this had increased to 155,800 tons (44 per cent.) and in1957 was 146,200 tons (40 per cent.). The opening of large alternative markets ismade virtually impossible by the tariff and quota policies followed by mostEuropean and North American countries to protect their domestic producers.Indeed, markets such as Western Germany are at present closing up.V. Consumption of Butter and Margarine in the United Kingdom9. The consumption of butter in the United Kingdom is still well below thepre-war level, whereas the consumption of margarine, although it has been decliningas butter prices have fallen, is still well above that level. The estimated per caputconsumption of butter and margarine in various years is:  1938       1952       1953       1954       1955       1956       1957lb. lb. lb. lb. lb. lb. lb.Butter ... 24-1 10-9 13-2 14-0 14-6 15-6 16-7 (provisional)Margarine      10-0       19-3       17-8       18-3       17-9       16-9       15-6 (provisional)Total ...      34-1       30-2       31-0       32-3       32-5       32-5       32-it will be seen that the total consumption of butter and margarine together is stillslightly below pre-war and has remained at about the same level for the last fouryears.10. Whereas the average landed price of butter in the United Kingdom was 93 per ton in 1938 and  233 per ton in February 1958, the corresponding prices of margarine were  31 per ton and  116 10s. per ton. If allowance is made for thedecline in the real value of the pound, butter has fallen in price by 11 per cent,whereas margarine has risen by 32-  per cent. (The quality of margarine has alsoimproved substantially.) Average wholesale prices of butter in London were rising from 1950 to 1954 and have since been falling. Nevertheless, there has been anincrease in butter consumption per head of the population from 1952 onwards.(Rationing of fats ceased in 1954.) At the present moment the cheapest butter canbe obtained in the shops at a level a little below the price of the dearest margarine.VI.-Stocks11. Annex B illustrates the levels of stocks in public cold stores in the UnitedKingdom from the end of 1955 to March 1958. A major increase in stocks (from,000 to 58,000 tons) took place in January-July 1956, which was the peak year for new Zealand imports. The peak butter stock was reached between March and june 1957 after which there was a fairly rapid decline, only sporadically broken,until the end of the year. Thereafter there was again a steady increase from january 1958 onwards. Stocks in cold stores are the main element in unsold stocks:they exclude butter in transit. The present stock level of 70,000 tons is made up of47,000 tons of New Zealand butter, 16,000 tons of Australian and the balance from
a variety of small sources. Whereas the New Zealand and Australian dairyauthorities own their stocks in the United Kingdom, and release them on to themarket at their discretion, the stocks of butter from other countries are principallyowned by importers and merchants. The main shipping season for New Zealandbutter is October to March and stocks normally tend to rise in the first quarter ofthe year. We were informed that Danish, Swedish and Finnish butter is not of the&quot; keeping &quot; variety and that stocks of it held in cold store in this country were therefore normally very small. New Zealand butter on the other hand can bestored in good condition for upwards of six months.VII. The Butter Industry in New Zealand12. The dairy industry in New Zealand is a very important part of thecountry&apos;s economy, and butter is the most valuable product of that industry. Some90 per cent, of milk produced in New Zealand is processed, and of that 80 per cent,goes into butter. The bulk of this butter is exported, almost all to the UnitedKingdom. Thus, in 1956 New Zealand&apos;s total exports were valued at 270-7 millions, of which dairy produce accounted for as much as  81-5 millions(30 per cent.). This included exports of butter valued at  51-9 millions or 19 percent, of total exports. The United Kingdom is New Zealand&apos;s traditional market and the country&apos;s farm economy is, in fact, geared to supply the United Kingdom.During the war there were bulk purchase agreements between the Ministry of food and New Zealand under which New Zealand&apos;s exportable surplus of butter was almost wholly supplied to the United Kingdom. In 1947 the New zealand government entered into a long-term agreement for the supply of dairy products tothe United Kingdom and during the time this agreement was in force the prices charged for butter and cheese were increased each year. With the decontrol ofdairy products in the United Kingdom in 1954 the bulk purchase dairy contractwas terminated as from the beginning of the 1954-55 season.13. Successive New Zealand Governments have encouraged a high level of consumption of butter in New Zealand itself the per caput consumption is thehighest in the world by forbidding the sale of butter substitutes such as margarineand by means of a consumer subsidy which keeps the internal retail price of butterat a low level. The New Zealand farmers receive a guaranteed price for their products, fixed by the Dairy Products Prices Authority. This guaranteed price is related to a notional figure of cost of production which is fixed jointly by the NewZealand Dairy Board (consisting of elected representatives of the dairy industryand a Government nominee) and the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture. once this cost of production figure has been agreed, the guaranteed price cannot beless than 95 per cent, of it. Furthermore, the guaranteed price may not be reducedby more than 5 per cent, in any one year, although there is no upper limit to themovement of the price. By an Act passed in 1947 it was specified that surplusrevenues accumulated from the export of butter in any one season were to be paid into a reserve fund (the Dairy Industry Account) rather than passed back to the farmer. Under a further Act in 1956 any such surpluses would first have to be usedto equate the guaranteed price to the farmers with the maximum assessed cost ofproduction of butter and cheese for the season if the guaranteed price fell below thismaximum. The intention is that the guaranteed price scheme should be self-balancing, the profits in one year being used to offset the losses in another.However, should declining overseas sales or prices lead to an actual deficit in thereserve fund, the New Zealand Government is under statutory obligation to honourthe guaranteed prices. For dairy produce sold within New Zealand the amountreceived by the producer is made up from Government funds to the equivalent ofthe guaranteed price so that the return to the farmer is the same whether the productis sold for export or on the home market.VIII. Evidence of Material Injury14. The New Zealand Government have pointed out that, although their total exports of butter to the United Kingdom were still considerably higher in 1957 thanthe average for the pre-war years, at a time when butter consumption in the United.Kingdom is still below the pre-war level, the marked reductions in price over thelast few years have seriously affected their dairy industry. Since 1956 New Zealandbutter has been sold to the United Kingdom at prices of up to  100 per ton belowthe return received by the producers in New Zealand. The result is that the NewZealand farmers&apos; own reserves in the Dairy Industry Account (which have been
built up out of monies set aside from returns in previous years, particularly duringthe currency of the bulk purchase agreement with the United Kingdom, whensubstantial profits were made) have been severely depleted. In the year endingJuly 1957 there was a loss to the Dairy Industry Account of  12 - 2 millions, of whichapproximately  10^ millions was attributable to losses on butter. At present prices for butter the New Zealand Government estimate that there will be a further loss to the Dairy Industry Account of over  15 millions by the end of July 1958 and thatthe total of  28 millions which was in the Account in July 1956 and which represented its highest point, will then have been exhausted in two years. At thispoint the Dairy Industry Account will no longer be able to meet the demands madeon it to honour the guaranteed price to the farmers and the Government will haveto take over this obligation. In doing this, the New Zealand Government have pointed out that they will inevitably have to consider taking steps to bring the returns to the dairy farmers more into line with realised prices.15. The Dairy Industry Account represents funds belonging to the NewZealand dairy industry and its depletion can, in our view, be considered as relevant to the issue of injury. While it is true that the purpose of these funds was to offsetlosses in a bad year from profits in a good year, the running down of these funds hasbeen more rapid, and has gone further, than might reasonably have been expectedunder normal trading conditions. Moreover, with every sign that total imports of butter into the United Kingdom as well as domestic production in 1958 will be higherthan in 1957, there is no ground for expecting that the trend in prices will be significantly reversed.16. The New Zealand Government claim that dumping of butter from finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic has been largely responsible for the weakening of prices and to the consequent losses to the New Zealand dairy industry&apos;reserves. The average prices of butter in the United Kingdom over the past threeyears were:  (Cost per cwt.)

The applicants point out that thesefalls in price have had a serious effect on New Zealand&apos;s overseas earnings; whereas the quantity of butter exported to the United Kingdom in 1957 fell by only just over per cent, compared with 1956, by value the fall was nearly 20 per cent. a continuation of such low returns to New Zealand dairy producers will, according tothe applicants, inevitably result in a reduction of capital investment on farms andin factories as well as in reduced expenditure on herd improvement, regrassing and fertilisers. New Zealand&apos;s position as an efficient low-cost producer of butter will then be seriously threatened. A switch to other types of dairy production, such ascheese or milk powder, would involve heavy capital losses on farms, in factories and in transport facilities because of the very different type of equipment needed.In any case the applicants point out that these alternative products are also currentlyin over-supply and that their prices, too, have fallen sharply. The possibilities of aswitch from dairying to meat or wool production are limited.17. In considering these claims by the New Zealand Government we havetaken note of the fact that substantial losses to the New Zealand Dairy IndustryAccount on butter had occurred before Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republicre-entered the United Kingdom market. Moreover, losses themselves cannot beconsidered without reference to the level of the guaranteed price because they could result from the maintenance of that price at an unduly high level. It cannot,therefore, in our view, either be maintained that the whole loss to the New Zealandindustry&apos;s reserves is necessarily the measure of injury or that the loss itself is whollyattributable to the dumping of butter from these three countries. A number of factors have joined together to bring about the reduction in prices to the present low level which is proving unremunerative to the New Zealand industry and which isexhausting the New Zealand farmers&apos; reserves.  In the first place, we have noted
that the production of creamery butter in the United Kingdom has been increasingsteadily since 1955 and is expected to be still higher this year than it was in 1957.It is reasonable to conclude that this increase of domestic production, stimulated by government subsidy arrangements, has helped to bring the price of butter down.In the second place, we have taken note of the effects of New Zealand&apos;s ownmarketing policy in the United Kingdom in the past few years. As pointed out inparagraph 11 above, the stocks of butter held in the United Kingdom arepredominantly New Zealand or Australian. It is a matter for the New Zealanddairy industry&apos;s representatives in the United Kingdom who control these stocks todecide at what point they should be built up and sold, and towards the end of 1956(that is, before imports from Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic had come onto the market on any scale) New Zealand, having built up large stocks in the first half of the year, had run down her cold-store stocks in the United Kingdom verysharply. This was a matter of commercial judgment at the time and was no doubtdictated by the fact that room had to be made for new arrivals of butter from NewZealand. The effect of these large sales was, however, to depress the prices, which did not subsequently recover until the middle of 1957. New Zealand may,therefore, be said to have contributed tc her own troubles to the extent that theNew Zealand dairy industry&apos;s reserve funds were depleted at that time by the lower prices for butter brought about by heavy New Zealand sales from stock.18. We have been informed that in 1958 estimated arrivals of butter from NewZealand will be 160,000 tons compared with 146,000 tons in 1957. In addition, NewZealand would like to see stocks in the United Kingdom run down by 20,000 tonsbelow the level at the end of .1957 (which was 50,000 tons). The import figures forthe first quarter of 1958 indicate that this expectation concerning increased arrivalsmay well be realised. Apart from an expected reduction in imports of butter from australia and Argentina, all other main suppliers seem likely at least to maintain their 1957 level of exports to the United Kingdom and may indeed increase it as aresult of the closure of the German market. In the first quarter of 1958 importsfrom Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic were at an annual rate slightly inexcess of the total from these sources for 1957. We have been informed thatconsumption of butter in the United Kingdom may be some 30,000 tons higher in1958 than in 1957. (Since the total consumption of fats has remained remarkablystatic, it is probable that any such increase in butter consumption will be at theexpense of margarine, thus continuing the existing trend.) It may be, therefore,that the stage of over-supply of the United Kingdom market will be even more marked in 1958, to which New Zealand herself will be contributing.19. In considering the arrangements for the production and marketing of butter in New Zealand, we took note of the fact that exports have for some time been at a price below the guaranteed price and thus below the figure fixed as thenotional cost of production. From the evidence available to us it was impossibleto determine whether this cost of production was fixed at a reasonable level or was too high. We observed that, although the guaranteed price may be reduced by amaximum of 5 per cent, in any one season, it had not been reduced by this full amount for the 1957-58 season when, in view of the obvious price trend and supply position, one would have expected a reduction to the full extent. On the other hand,we considered that, in so far as its policy was directed towards encouraging the domestic consumption of butter, New Zealand, unlike the countries complained of,was to that extent helping herself to avert the consequence of over-supply.IX. Conclusion20. It was not difficult for the Committee to determine that the New Zealanddairy industry was being injured. The great difficulty was to decide whether thisinjury could be described as material, and how much of it, if any, could be attributedin isolation to the dumping of butter by Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic.21. The Committee&apos;s conclusion is that the injury to the New Zealandindustry can reasonably be termed material. Although it is true that the NewZealand farmer himself has not yet been injured in the sense that his actual annual income has been reduced, his reserves have dwindled at a rate which he could not reasonably have expected and this injury is likely to continue.22. As regards the part played by the three countries complained of, it is clearbeyond doubt from the margin of dumping involved that, were Finland, sweden and the Irish Republic not to dump in the sense of selling their butter abroad at a
price below that on their domestic markets, they would sell no butter at all in theUnited Kingdom. To compete at all in the United Kingdom market they mustsell at or below prevailing prices there, and in doing so they inevitably tend to depress those prices still further. It is reasonable to suppose that, had Finland,Sweden and the Irish Republic not sent to the United Kingdom any of the50,000 tons which they in fact exported between them in 1957, New Zealand wouldhave been better off. She would probably have sold more herself in order to reduceher stocks and, even if the running down of New Zealand stocks in the UnitedKingdom resulted in some lowering of the price, this reduction in heavy stocksoverhanging the market would have had some compensating effect. Similarly, ifFinland, Sweden and the Irish Republic sent no butter to the United kingdom in 1958 as they could not do if they did not dump New Zealand could beexpected to improve her share of the market and increase her sales even beyondthe level which she already envisages.23. Had Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic been selling their butter ata time of rising prices, the effect on New Zealand&apos;s exports would have been much less serious. It was the fact that they began to sell on a substantial scale in 1957,when the price on the market was already depressed by New Zealand&apos;s own actions,by the effect of increased domestic production in the United Kingdom, and byother contributory causes, that proved injurious to New Zealand and to otherregular suppliers, particularly Denmark.24. The Committee are therefore of the unanimous view that the dumpingof butter from Finland, Sweden and the Irish Republic is a contributory factor in causing and threatening this material injury to the New Zealand dairy industry.As we have endeavoured to make clear in our Report, there are a number of other reasons for this injury and it is impossible to say the extent to which one factoris ihe cause rather than another. We are satisfied, however, that, had there been no dumped imports from these countries, the New Zealand position would havebeen significantly better than it now is and that this dumping may therefore be saidto have caused, and to threaten, material injury to the New Zealand dairy industrywithin the terms of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act.list April, 1958.
