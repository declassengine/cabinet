(58) 7029th March, 1958CABINETCOMPENSATION  FOR  COMPULSORY  ACQUISITION   OF  land memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy seal the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (58) 6th Meeting, Item 1) have recently approved, subject to decision by the Cabinet, the proposal in the annexed reportby the Lord Chancellor which recommends:  (i) that the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition of land be amended to provide for market value;.(ii) that no change should be made in the compensation payable for planningrestrictions;(iii) that no attempt should be made to provide for recovery of betterment.I need not repeat the arguments in support of these recommendations, whichare set out briefly in the report.2. If we decide to legislate on the lines proposed an important question arises on the timing of the announcement of our intention. During the interval between an announcement and the introduction of the Bill, compulsoryacquisitions already in progress would be prejudiced and there would be demands for the legislation to be retrospective. This would be impracticable and it follows that no announcement of our intention to legislate should be made beforeThe Queen&apos;s Speech and that the Bill should be introduced immediately thereafter.Preparation of the Bill, if we decide to proceed with it, should, therefore, be pressed forward between now and October.3. There remains the question of Captain Corfield&apos;s Bill which seeks alsoto provide the market value basis for compensation for compulsory acquisition and received its Second Reading by a large majority. While Captain Corfieldcannot be given a definite assurance of Government legislation, if that is the cabinet&apos;s decision, I believe that he could be persuaded not to proceed further with his Bill by an assurance that the Government were giving serious consideration to the problem.4.   I invite my colleagues to decide:  (i) that a Bill should be introduced at the beginning of next session to amend the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition, providing formarket value as from the date of the introduction of the Bill; and thatthe work of preparing the Bill should be pressed forward;(ii) that no change should be made in the compensation payable for planningrestrictions;(iii) that no attempt should be made to provide for the recovery of betterment;(iv) that no  announcement  of our  intentions  should  be  made  untilThe Queen&apos;s Speech.R.

COMPENSATION FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LANDReport by the Lord ChancellorIntroduction1.   The Sub-Committee was appointed by the Home Affairs Committee at.its meeting on 17th January (H.A. (58) 1st Meeting, Minute 1) with the followingmembership and terms of reference:  Membership Lord Chancellor (In the Chair).Secretary of State for Scotland.Minister of Housing.Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Minister of Health.Financial Secretary, Treasury.Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Power.Terms of Reference &quot; To give further consideration to the issues affecting a decision tointroduce legislation to adjust the basis of compensation for compulsory purchase, including the impact of any change in this basis on the basis ofcompensation for planning restrictions; to consider the basis, scope and timing of such legislation; and to make recommendations.&quot;Compensation for Compulsory Purchase2. We have come to the conclusion that legislation should be introduced at the beginning of next Session providing that the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition should be market value. The Under-Secretary of state has, however, desired to reserve the position of the Secretary of State for Scotland.3. We believe that the &quot; two-price &quot; system, under which an owner sometimesgets much less from a public authority buying his land than he would get froma private purchaser, can no longer be defended. This is demonstrated by the factthat a Second Reading has been given to the Compensation (Acquisition and planning) Bill, introduced by Captain Corfield, the main object of which is toprovide for market value on compulsory acquisition. Second Reading was givenby 123 votes to 2 despite the advice given to the House by the Minister of Housingthat, while the Government had sympathy with the main object of the Bill, andwere themselves considering how the law might be amended, the Bill would notwork and could not be made to work. But quite apart from that demonstrationthe members of the Sub-Committee are all convinced that market value oughtnow to be made payable on compulsory acquisition.4. The amendment of the law which would be required would not be quitestraightforward; but the Sub-Committee do not think it should be very complicated. The main difficulties would be political, arising from pressure by government supporters to go further than we should wish to do, and from criticismby the Opposition about the gift of &quot; unearned increment&quot; to land-owners. Bothconsiderations are referred to further below.5. The additional cost to public authorities would not be great in total;but there would be individual cases where it was significant. A particular difficultyarises over the increased cost of slum clearance which may result where a localauthority is buying land in the centre of a city which has industrial or commercialvalue. This is being further investigated. When detailed proposals have been worked out there will have to be confidential discussions with the representativesof local authorities. It is not expected that they will be opposed to a change to market value, but they may possibly argue that for some services there should be additional Exchequer assistance. The Minister of Housing does not envisagethat this should be conceded.
Compensation for Planning Restrictions6. We have considered whether a change to market value for compulsory acquisition would affect the existing basis of compensation for planning restrictions(which is limited to the amount of any claims made under the Town and country planning Act, 1947, for development value existing at that date). We do notthink that the change in the one need affect the other; and while we cannot besure that the removal of the grievances about acquisition would not be followedby a demand for improved compensation for restrictions, there is no sign of thatat present.7. We have also considered whether there is any case on merits for improvingcompensation for restrictions. We believe that it is essential to the maintenanceof planning control that the compensation payable for restrictions should belimited; we are doubtful whether any basis for the limitation can be found otherthan that already existing; and we are convinced that it can be defended at anyrate for the foreseeable future. One or two of our members think, however, thatif there were to be a scheme for recovering betterment (on which see below) weshould then need to reconsider the compensation for planning restrictions.8. We conclude that if the Government decide to provide the market valuebasis for compulsory acquisition they should at the same time resolve to stand firm on compensation for planning restrictions.9. The opportunity should, however, be taken to deal with &quot; planning blight &quot;;i.e., buildings which become unsaleable because there is a proposal to acquirethem for a public purpose at some future date.Recovery of Betterment10. A change to the market value basis on compulsory acquisition will inevitably raise once again the issue of betterment. We shall get cases where apublic authority has to pay a high price for land because its own expenditure onthe provision of services and/or the operation of planning control limitingdevelopment to the particular land has increased its development value. In futurean authority will, sometimes, be able to anticipate the increase in value by buyingthe land it will need in advance; and that we must be prepared to approve. but where development has already begun (e.g., in New Towns) the value of the land has already been increased.11. There is an obvious case for recovery of some part of the increase ofdevelopment value, other than increases directly due to expenditure by the owner of the land, and we believe that some of our own supporters might welcome theidea. The Opposition will certainly criticise the absence of any provision forrecovery. We have therefore considered whether a workable scheme could be devised.12. The Minister of Housing has put before us the outline of a scheme whichwould provide that development value should be ascertained at the time that landis sold or leased (by reference to the sale price or rent) and the vendor taxed on hiscapital gain at that time, allowance being made for any expenditure incurred bythe owner in creating the value. The Minister made it clear, however, that such ascheme would have many difficulties and that he did not himself support it. TheBoard of Inland Revenue while agreeing that such a scheme is likely to be the least objectionable that could be devised, confirmed that the practical difficulties wouldbe formidable, and that the revenue likely to be derived from the scheme would hardly justify the cost of collection; and they added that from their point of view the most serious objection was that the plan would constitute, in effect, a limited tax on capital gains. This would, they thought, be indefensible.13. It is plain that no scheme for recovery of betterment could be worked outin time for a Bill next Session. Some of us are very doubtful whether a conservative government will ever wish to introduce such a scheme, but we think that thepossibility might be kept open. That is to say we should certainly not promise towork on a scheme for recovery of betterment, but neither should we declare thatwe are opposed to it.
House of Lords, S.W. 1.19th March, 1958.Retrospection14. Perhaps the most difficult question arising on a change in the basis ofcompensation for compulsory acquisition is that of retrospection. There will almost certainly be a demand for some measure of retrospection from members of ourown Party; and it might be supported by some members of the Opposition. Wethink that the Government must stand firm against this. It is not practicable tore-open past transactions; and retrospection is in any event a mischievous principle.One form which the demand will take is a proposal for discretionary additional payments in &quot; hardship &quot; cases. This too we must resist. What is paid for landmust depend on the circumstances of the land, not on those of the owner.15. A particular difficulty concerned with retrospection is that from themoment it is announced that the Government propose to amend the law in orderto provide for market value, compulsory acquisition on existing terms will becomealmost impossible. Therefore we cannot announce it until we are ready to introduce the Bill; the new basis can apply from the date of introduction but not earlier. Thisis a difficulty over Captain Corfield&apos;s Bill. He would withdraw the Bill if he receiveda firm promise that the Government intended to legislate next Session; but thatis a promise we cannot make and without it he will not withdraw. The Bill would need a Financial Resolution before Report and Third Reading, but not beforeCommittee. Committee stage may be reached on 2nd April. The Minister of housing is conferring with the Chief Whip about this situation.Conclusion16. If it is agreed that the Government should legislate next Session asproposed, we suggest that we should now look at the proposals in detail and reporton them in due course.17.   We recommend (i) that a Bill should be introduced at the beginning of next Session to amend the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition, providing formarket value as from the date of the introduction of the Bill;(ii) that no change should be made in the compensation payable for planningrestrictions;(iii) that no attempt should be made to provide for the recovery of betterment;(iv) that no announcement of our intentions should be made until The Queen&apos;sSpeech;(v) that we should now examine, with the assistance of parliamentary counsel, the provisions to be included in the Bill and report again tothe Committee in due course.K.
