j SECRET 238i(T*KtS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government.(5C) S3 COPY NO.21st April, 195P.CABINETTERRITORIAL WATERSMermrandum by^ the Attorney-GeneralThe First Committee of the International Conference on the law of the Sea voted on 19th April on the various proposals related to the breadth of the Territorial Sea.    I have set out in the Annex a record ofthe voting.    The Conference is likely to consider the territorial sea inplenary session on Wednesday, 23rd April.    It is therefore necessary toconsider what attitude we should adopt in plenary session.The Substantive Proposals/lone of the proposals on the breadth of the territorial seasecured the approval of the Committee, and on this point the Committeehas nothing to report to the plenary session.    Various proposals will,however, no doubt re-appear.-(a) The Canadian proposal for twelve miles exclusive fishingThis does not relate to the breadth of the territorial sea but onlyto fishing rights.    As will be seen from paragraph 2 of the Annex, thisproposal was severed from the complementary proposal that the maximumbreadth of the territorial sea should not exceed six miles, and secured a majority of two in the Committee (it w;. j the only proposal to receivethe approval of the Committee).    Mr. Dean (United States) assured methis morning that he would do his utmost to defeat this proposal.    V/edid consider whether we should move an amendment to it, providingfor fishing by those who have regularly fished the area.    We came tothe conclusion that it was inadvisable to do this, as it was certain thatsuch an amendment would not, in the plenary session, get the necessary two-thirds majority, and as an adverse decision upon it might prejudice the attitude of the Conference towards the American proposal.    our right course, I feel sure, should be to do all we can to prevent theCanadian proposal getting the necessary two-thirds majority.(b) The Mexico-Indian proposal (each State to be free to claim abreadth of twelve-miles territorial sea)This proposal is certain to be revived in plenary session.     Weshould vote against it.    V/e shall however have more difficulty in preventing its acceptance by a simple majority than we did in theCommittee.    Great efforts will be made by its sponsors to add to itsadherents.
(c)   The United States proposal (maximum breadth of territorial seato br six miles:   exclusive fishing rights up to twelve mileswith a reservation of a right to fish the outer six miles for thosewho have regularly fished the waters for the past five years)Although there is no chance of this proposal getting a two-thirds majority, its being tabled may do a good deal to prevent a swing infavour of the Mexico-Indian proposal.    It also has the further advantage that it refers to exclusive fishing while preserving the rights of thosewho have fished the waters for the past five years.    The tabling ofthis proposal might justify some of our friends who really -vould like tosupport the Canadian proposal, in preferring and voting for it instead.Australia, for example, would rather like a cwelve-mile limit for fishing.Among the countries who abstained fron. voting on the Canadian fishingproposal were Austria, Denmark and Finland.    I believe it might stiilbe worth making efforts to get them to alter their attitude:  to oppose theCanadian proposal and support the American.    It might also be worthmaking a special effort with Ghana, because the reservation of existingfishing rights would not adversely affect her.    The effect of theAmerican proposals in Committee has been, in both the American view and ours, to prevent the Mexico-Indian proposal getting a clear majority there.    We have now established very close co-operation notonly with the United States, but with France, Italy p.nd other Europeantountrias.     The fact that we have made efforts to compromise has got us out of the position of possibly being held responsible for theConference breaking down and has put the onus on those who disagieewith us.    I think we should seek to maintain this position and not makeit look as if we had turned sour by withholding our support to theAmerican compromise proposal.To sum up, therefore, my recommendation is that we should oppose the Canadian and Mexico-Indian proposals and support theAmerican proposal.Quertions of Frocedure3.      Saudi-Arabia is going to propose in the First Committee that,as no agreement as to the breadth of the territorial sea has been achieved, the Secretary-General of the United Nations should be invitedto study ways and means, including the convocation of a special conference, with a view to arriving at an agreement;   and that theCommittee should decide to accept a number of principles until such agreement is realised.    Two of the principles are said to be (a) that international practice is not uniform as regards the delimitation of theterritorial sea, and (b) that the extension by a State of its territorial sea to a twelve-mile limit is not a breach of international law.    Weshall fight this Resolution on the basis that any Resolution of this kind is premature before considering the matter at a plenary session.     Buta number of delegations will try to raise this issue later.    I think (andthe American delegation agree) that this would be very dangerousbecause all those who wanted to extend their territorial sea would doso without hesitation or delay.    But we should consider whether weshould not have ready an amendment simply requesting the Secretary-General to study furtht-r ways and means of securing an agreement about the extent of this territorial sea.    I would recommend thiscourse.S1CR1T
5.      Should the Mexico-Indian proposal get a majority in plenary session, even though not a two-thirds majority, the Netherlands, withthe support of other Western European countries and the United States,are considering the advisability of a declaration being made by the maritime Powers on the lines of the draft contained in Geneva telegramMo. 199.    I believe that, should the Conference not reach any agreement,it would certainly do no harm, so far as our future position wasconsidered, if at the end of the Conference a declaration were made byall the maritime Powers to the effect that, while they were ready and willing to discuss with other States proper fishery regulations forpurposes of reservation, etc. , outside the three-mile area, it was theirfirm opinion, to which they had adhered, that the three-mile limit was right lor the territorial sea.     Such a declaration might perhaps detersome from claiming a broader limit and it might aiSo help should theresubsequently be any litigation before the International Court.6.      Each Committee is supposed to recommend the form in which its conclusions should be embodied.    Our estimate is that therecommendation will be for a Convention or series of Conventions.The Conference will decide to which articles it will be permissiblefor signatory States to make reservations.     Should the Canadianproposal about exclusive fishing be adopted, for example, v/e shouldobviously seek to make a reservation with regard to that.    When theConference is concluded, I understand that States participating at theConference will be asked to sign some document as a record of what theConference has decided;  and that then there will be a period, say sixmonths, within which States can determine whether or not to sign theConvention, which would be subject to ratification.&quot;Innocent Passage&quot;7.      It is obviously desirable that Article 24, which provides forpassage of warships being made subject to previous authorisation ornotification, should be blocked if possible.    We are, with the.Americans, taking the necessary steps to this end.     It is doubtful ifwe shall succeed, but efforts will be worth making at least to secureabstention.General Conduct of the Conference8.      There is one feature of the Conference to which I should draw attention.    The line taken by the Afro-Asian group was decided upon attheir meeting on Thursday afternoon.     .Mr. Dean (United States) informed me this morning that certain members of that group on whom the americans had counted for support had told him that they were subjectto tremendous pressure to support the Afro-Asian group; that Nepal,for example, had been threatened with economic sanctions if she didnot do it;  that Iran, upon whom they counted, had also been threatenedand so had abstained;  that Libya, upon whom the Americans counted,and who had promised their support, abstained, and their delegatetold Mr. Dean that he had been under terrific pressure.    The positionseems to be this:  that the Egyptian, Mr. Lutf i, has now securedleadership of the Afro-Asian group in place of Mr. Sen of India whohas now returned to India.    The Egyptians and Saudis, because of
their attitude to Israel, are determined to get a twelve-mile territorial sea and, although India has said that she would he perfectly satisfied,as I believe would also be Ceylon, by the American proposal, to avoid a rupture in the Afro-Asian group, they have followed the lead of the egyptians.    The situation wculd look more ominous in the event offurther recruits to this group, particularly in view of their close co-operation with the Soviet Union.    It is not for me to express any view on the ominous signs resulting from the conduct of the Afro-Asian group and its apparent control by the Egyptians at this Conference, but Ishould perhaps add that it was obvious that Mexico and Saudi-Arabiawere acting in the closest association with the Rissians.    The united arab Republic sit next to the Russians at the Conference so that allwork nicely together.conclusion.      To sum up, I recommend: -(a) that we should, by supporting the United States proposal on the breadth of the territorial sea, try to secure the defeat of the. Canadian and Mexico-Indian proposals;(b) that if, as seems likely, the Conference ends withoutagreement on this point, we should prevent the making of any declaration which implies that international lawrecognises a breadth of territorial sea of more than three miles;  and seek ourselves to establish atleast temporary recognition of the three-mile limit.R.M. -B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C.2.20th April, 1958.-4-
A^HEXTHE VOTING ON SATURDAY, 19TH APRIL, 1958The United States moved that their revised proposal, namely thatthe maximum breadth of the Territorial Sea should be six miles;  thcteach State should have the exclusive rights of fishing in a zone having a maximum breadth of twelve miles, subject to the right of vessels of?ny State which has fished regularly during the past five years in thosewaters to fish the outer six miles, subject to appropriate conservation andto a provision for arbitration for disputes, should be &quot;voted on first.This motion was defeated by a majority of seven (31 For, 3 8 Against,12 Abstentions).2.      Canada&apos;s proposal then fell to be considered.     It was (a) that themaximum breadth of the Territorial Sea should not exceed six miles and(b) that each State should have the right to exclusive fishing up to12 miles.    Mr. Drew, in his speech, stressed that this was only a revision of the original   Canadian proposal, by altering a three-milesTerritorial Sea to a maximum of six miles.    Mr. Bing, representingGhana, moved that proposal (a) and proposal (b) should be voted on-^separately.    There was objection to this but the motion was carried bya majority of eight (36 For, 28 Against, 18 Abstentions).    India, Malaya,Canada and Ceylon, in addition to Ghana, voted for the motion.    Canadadid so despite the assurance by Mr. Drew given both to me and toMr. Dean (United States) that the proposal was a package deal.3.      The first part of the- Canadian proposal (that the maximumbreadth of the Territorial Sea should be six miles) was defeated by amajority of thirty-seven (11 For, including Canada, 48 Against, includingthe United States, United Kingdom, India, Malaya and Ceylon,23 Abstaining).The second part of the Canadian proposal (that there should bea twelve-mile fishery zone) was carried by a majority of two (37 For,including India, Ghana, Malaya and Ceylon, 35 Against, 9 Abstentions).4.      We then voted on the Mexico-Indian proposal that each state should be free to claim a breadth of Territorial Sea of twelve miles.35 voted For, including India, Ghana, Malaya and Ceylon:   35 voted against, including Canada;  with 12 Abstentions.    The proposal was not,therefore, adopted.    Bafore the Chairman announced the result of thisroll-call vote, the Mexican delegate, realising as we all did what theresult would be, rushed over to the Ecuador delegate, held up his armand, amid cries of &quot;Shame&quot; from those who saw what was happening, force&apos;the Ecuador delegate to claim that, in spite of abstaining, he wanted to vote for the motion.    The Chairman refused to let him do so.    Therewas an appeal against the Chairmari&apos;s decision, but it was upheld by alarge majority.5.      The U.S.S.R. proposal that States should as a rule have territorial sea of twelve miles was defeated by a substantial majority.-1-
6.      The Columbian proposal that the sovereignty of a State extend to a belt of sea twelve miles broad was then taken.     Columbia tried to alter this by saying that it meant &quot;not exceeding twelve miles&quot;, soas to attract all the supporters of the Mexico-Indiaii proposal and to try to reverse the verdict on that proposal.     The Chairman, on myobjecting, refused to allow this.    His decision was appealed against,but he was supported by a majority of twenty.     The proposal itself was defeated by a majority of nine (33 For, including India and Malaya;42 Against, including Canada and Ghana;   7 Abstentions).7.      I withdrew the United Kingdom proposal of six miles of territorial Sea with complete passage rights for ships and aircraftoutside three miles.3.      The Swedish proposal for a six-mile Territorial Sea was defeated by a substantial majority.9.      We then came to the American proposal referred to inparagraph 1.     Canada then moved that that proposal should be split upso as to secure a separate vote on the provision reserving rights tofish where there had been fishing during the past five years.     Mexicomoved an amendment to this to seek to divide the United States   proposalinto three separate parts.    All proposals to split the United states proposal were defeated .     The United States proposal itself was defeatedby two votes (36 For, 3 8 Against, including Canada, India, Ghana,Malaya and Ceylon and 9 Abstentions).10.    India then moved that the Mexico-Indian proposal should bere-consi.dered, but this was defeated by a majority of three (36 For,39 Against, 7 Abstentions - India, Ghana, Malaya and Ceylon voting forthe proposal, and Ca.nada against).
