IS DCTHE YEMENNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate the result of an examination of our legal position on retaliatory fire against the Yemen.     This examination was made at therequest of the Defence Committee (D. (58) 7th Meeting, Item 2).2. In the time available it has not been possible to agree this statement of our position with the Colonial Office.S.JL.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.14th April, 1958.COUNTER-BATTERY FIRE AGAINST THE YEMENLEGAL, POSITION OF HER MAJEST Y&apos;S government under the Charter of the United Nations, Pier Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, like all other members, are obliged to try to adjust or settleinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means and, in general, to refrain from the threat or the use of force.    Articles 1(1) and 2(2) of the charter, read in the light of the Charter as a whole, would be taken bythe large majority of members of the United Nations to mean that members should resort to the appropriate organ of the United Nations inany case in which there is a threat to the peace or a breach of thepeace, before they resort to the use of force, unless the use of force isnecessary by way of self defence against armed attack.    If the right ofself defence is exercised, under Article 51 of the Charter, a member isobliged to report to the Security Council whatever measures he takes.2. Legally, therefore, in dealing with breaches of the peacecommitted by the Yemen in firing across the border, Pier Majesty&apos;sGovernment should go to the Security Council for assistance or, if thatis not feasible, should report to the Security Council any action takenin the exercise of the right of self defence.    In fact, we have hithertodone neither of these things.-1-(THIS&quot;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(53) 81 COPY NO. (9 /14th April, 1958CABINET
3. The classic exposition in International Law of the circumstances which justify resort to self defence is that there must be &quot;a necessity ofself defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and nomoment for deliberation&quot;.    It might be difficult for us to maintainconvincingly that on every occasion counter-battery action against the yemen taken at intervals over a considerable period would fall within thescope of this definition.    On balance our action hitherto would probably beaccepted as a legitimate exercise of the right of self defence, althoughour failure to report to the Security Council in accordance with our obligations under Article 51 would be bound to weigh against us.4. Nevertheless, apart from our need to postpone any action in theUnited Nations until we have discussed various policies with the americans, there would be tactical disadvantages for us to bring theissue to the Security Council specifically under Article 51 (even if wehad decided to refer the dispute to the United Nations (since, in the eyes of the public, this would probably focus attention on our counter-measures, not on Yemeni provocation.    We must accept that if theYemenis take the initiative and charge us with aggression in the united nations, and if we have to plead self defence as our only justification, our opponents will be able to score an important point against us by pointing out that we have failed to comply with Article 51.    Even if we were now toreport any action we take to the Security Council, the point might bemade against us that we have already on occasion fired into Yemeniterritory without reporting to the Security Council;  while this might cause us some embarrassment, we are probably in a position to justify our omission to report to the Security Council.5. The position would become much more difficult if a serious incident involving considerable civilian casualties on Yemeni territory should occur.    If the Yemenis were in a position to bring evidence ofsuch an instance before the United Nations it would be very important for us to be able to justify our action on legal grounds if we were toobtain the necessary support even from friendly countries.    In order tobring ourselves within the law, we should have to comply with Article 51and report that we had exercised the right of self defence and we shouldhave to do this with great urgency if it were to appear convincing.Foreign Office, S.W.I.14th April, 1958.-2-
