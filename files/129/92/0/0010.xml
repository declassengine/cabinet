Economic Survey 1958INTRODUCTIONI. There were several promising developments in the economy during 1957but the year as a whole was nevertheless dominated by the crisis of confidence in sterling which came to a head in August and September. In the earlier part of the year the United Kingdom economy appeared to be generally in balance ; the economic results of the closing of the Suez Canal were less serious than had been expected. But by the middle of the year it was clearthat the wage increases granted in the earlier months were greater than the economy could absorb without a further rise in prices. This caused generaluneasiness abroad as well as at home at a time when sterling was seasonallyweak and when there were rumours of world-wide readjustments of exchange rates. These rumours began when the value of the French franc was adjustedand led to an outburst of speculation about the exchange rates of other currencies, especially sterling and the deutschemark. The immediate result was a drastic fall in the gold and dollar reserves: in August and Septemberalone they fell by  185 million a quarter of the total. This developmentthreatened both our own economy and that of the rest of the sterling area.2. On the 19th September, 1957, the Government announced a series of measures to deal with the situation. First, Bank-rate was raised from 5 to7 per cent, both to stop speculation against sterling and to fortify other measures for restricting credit. Secondly, the clearing banks agreed to restrict the level of bank advances during the following year to that ofthe previous year. Thirdly, steps were taken to hold the total of public investment to its 1957-58 level instead of letting the upward trend continue ;(this includes investment by the Government, local authorities and the public corporations). In these ways the Government sought to create an economic climate in which prices would stop rising. In addition the Government itselfgave a lead to industry by deciding that, where it was the employer, anyunavoidable increase in wages and salaries should be offset, wherever possible,by other economies. Following these steps it soon became evident thatconfidence in sterling was being restored: in the last quarter of 1957 the reserves were being rebuilt and the sterling holdings of non-sterling countries were going up. At home, there was growing public understanding of thecountry&apos;s economic difficulties. But the whole process of strengtheningconfidence, both abroad and at home, has to go further if the country is tohave a sound foundation for further economic development; and a number of major problems remain.3. This Economic Survey discusses the background to these developments and some of the problems likely to confront the country in 1958. Chapter Idiscusses first, the changes in the use of resources in 1957, that is in personal consumption, public authorities&apos; expenditure on goods and services, in invest-ment and in exports ; this discussion is in real or &quot; volume &quot; terms i.e. interms of constant prices. Secondly, this chapter looks at the changes in production and imports, also in volume terms, and at employment; thirdly,it examines the changes in money income and expenditure in different partsof the economy. This discussion shows that, at constant prices, total expendi-ture was almost 2 per cent higher in 1957 than in 1956 but that the increase
in actual money expenditure was 6 per cent. The difference reflects theincrease in prices which is, itself, analysed in some detail in Chapter II.Chapter III turns to the external position ; it begins with a short accountof economic developments in the world as a whole, because of theirsignificance for the United Kingdom, and then examines the UnitedKingdom&apos;s current balance of payments, its capital position and the problemof reserves and liabilities. Finally Chapter IV sums up the present position&apos;and considers the problems that lie ahead.CHAPTER IEXPENDITURE, OUTPUT AND INCOMEUse of Resources4. 1957 was a year of moderate expansion, in real terms, total finalexpenditure was  425 million higher than in 1956, an increase of almost2 per cent. This was a result of increases in home investment and in personal consumption: there was a significant fall in public authorities&apos;current expenditure on goods and services in real terms ; and exports ofgoods and services, which had accounted for three-quarters of the realincrease in expenditure in 1956, were virtually unchanged in 1957. Grossfixed investment and additions to stocks both increased by  140 million ;personal consumption went up by  220 million. These increases were met by a rise of just over 1-1- per cent in the gross domestic product and of3 per cent in imports of goods and services, but much of the additional imports went into stocks. These changes in expenditure and supplies in real terms are shown in the table on the opposite page. The following paragraphs discuss the changes in the main components of expenditure and supplies in more detail ; the discussion is in real terms, that is, values aremeasured at constant prices. (National income and expenditure at current prices are discussed in paragraphs 26-36.)Personal Consumption(see Tables 2 and 3 in Appendix A)5. Personal consumption in real terms was 2 per cent higher in 1957than in 1956. (The value of consumers&apos; expenditure went up by 5 per cent see paragraph 27 below.) The main increases were in purchases of durablehousehold goods and, from the second quarter of the year, in the numberof cars bought and in private motoring. This was largely a reaction fromthe sharp falls caused by the hire purchase regulations and by petrol rationing.There were decreases, however, in entertainment and in the use of public transport services (mainly because of the revival in private motoring).6. Apart from these major changes, from 1956 to 1957 there were small increases in consumption of most other goods and services. Consumption ofalcoholic drink increased by 2 per cent, and of tobacco by nearly 3 per cent.Food consumption rose by U per cent: there were increases in meat,poultry, cheese, eggs and butter but a decrease in margarine ; there were also increases in purchases of biscuits and other manufactured foods.Public Authorities&apos; expenditure. In 1957 current expenditure on goods and services by the Governmentand local authorities, together was 3 per cent lower, in real terms, than in

1956. This was a result of the substantial fall in the Governments expendi-ture on defence: the number of people in the Forces was reduced and therewas a decrease in spending on armaments. There were however small increases in Government spending on health and other items, and a con-tinuing steady increase in the current expenditure of local authorities. (TheGovernment accounts are considered in paragraphs 30-32 below.)Fixed Investment(see Table 4 in Appendix A)8. About one-third of the increase in total expenditure went on gross fixed investment which, in real terms, was about 5 per cent higher in 1957 thanin 1956 much the same rate of increase as in the previous year. The rateof growth in private investment was slower than in recent years but that in public investment was faster.9. In 1957 as in 1956 the industries where investment was expanding mostrapidly were those providing transport and communications : investment herewent up by nearly one-quarter. Investment in manufacturing industry, whichhad risen by 12 per cent in 1956, went up by only 3 per cent in 1957. Withinmanufacturing industry the largest rate of increase was again in mineral oilrefining ; investment in m^tal manufacturing also increased rapidly. Invest-ment in chemicals (excluding mineral oil refining), however, increased lessthan in 1956 and there was a decrease in investment by the engineering and allied industries.10. In 1957, in contrast to 1956, investment in plant, machinery and vehicles increased faster than investment in buildings. Investment in buildings(excluding houses) which had increased by over 10 per cent in each of thetwo preceding years, went up by 4 per cent in 1957, and investment in housing fell by 3 per cent.11. These recent changes in the pattern of investment need to be seen inperspective. Since 1953 total private investment has grown by nearly two-thirds while public investment has risen by not quite one-fifth. The mostrapid growth of private investment (excluding housing) took place in thethree years 1953-55 ; since 1955 public investment has risen more than in theearlier years and it increased substantially in 1957. Investment in housingreached its highest point in 1954 and since then has been slowly falling.Within this total there has been a noticeable shift in the relative importanceof public housing programmes and private building : in 1953 public expendi-ture in this field was twice as large as private, but by 1957 about half thehouses being built were for private owners. These changes are shown below.  million, 1948 prices	1951	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956	1957Public sector (&apos;) Private sector (&apos;) Housing         ......	740 591 316	675 619 377	668 688 493	681 803 519	704 946 479	733 1,022 469	790 1,088 453Total	1,647	1,671	1,849	2,003	2,129	2,224	2,331(&apos;) Excluding housing.12. Over the past five years the proportion of the gross national productdevoted to fixed investment has risen from 14 per cent to 17 per cent. not all of the investment that has taken place has represented net additions tothe productive capacity of the stock of fixed capital ; some of the assetsinstalled over the period have simply replaced other assets which have beenscrapped.   There can be little doubt, however, that over the economy as a
whole there has been a substantial increase in productive capacity. More-over, even investment which has taken the form of replacing existing plant and buildings must have improved the quality and thus the productivecapacity of the United Kingdom stock of capital.) Investment in Stocks and Work in Progress13. The value of the physical increase in all stocks in 1957 is estimatedat  370 million. In 1955 and 1956 the corresponding figures were  325 and 250 million. Strategic and trading stocks held by the Government con-tinued to fail during 1957 but increases in stock of mainly-imported materials and foodsluffs held by the trade partly offset this fall. There was also asubstantial increase in fuel stocks. Manufacturers&apos; stocks, which form about half the total, were 8 per cent higher in value at the end of 1957 than atthe end of 1956. In volume terms this represented an increase of 6 per cent.About half this increase represented work-in-progress. Over the past tenyears the growth of stocks in manufacturing industry has at least kept pace with the increase in production, but within the total of these stocks therehas been an increase in relation to output in the holdings of finished products and work-in-progress.Exports(see Tables 5 and 19 in Appendix A and paragraphs 1-9 in Appendix B)14. In 1957 exports of goods and services in real terms were about thesame as in 1956 ; services rose a little and re-exports fell. Merchandiseexports on a shipments basis expanded by only 2 per cent in volume, a smaller increase than in any year since 1953. Merchandise exports on apayments basis were no higher in 1957 than in 1956 ; the difference arisesbecause of timing and coverage adjustments^)- The expansion was confined to the first nine months of 1957 ; there was a marked change in trend inthe fourth quarter when the volume of exports was 2 per cent lower than ayear earlier.15. The increases were spread over all commodity groups except fuel andtextiles ; within the engineering group there was a particularly rapid expan-sion in exports of passenger cars. The check to growth in the fourth quarterof 1957 was also widespread, although engineering exports suffered less than others.Supplies of Goods and ServicesProduction(See Tables 6 and 7 in Appendix A)16. The increases in consumption and investment discussed above were met partly by an expansion in home production and partly by imports. Thetotal output of goods and services in this country (that is the gross domestic product) was 1J; per cent higher in 1957 than in 1956 a slightly larger increase than the one that occurred in the previous year but substantially less than the average annual increases from 1948 to 1955.17. Industrial production, which accounts for about two-fifths of the gross domestic product, was also 1J per cent higher on average than in 1956. Inthe early months of the year^ total industrial production hardly rose at all,(&apos;) See footnote to Table 19 in Appendix A.9
bin in the second quarter there was a .small increase, and this higher levelwas; maintained for the rest of the year. These changes are shown belowui the index of industrial production from which seasonal variations have----_,_._                            Index 1948 = inn			Years	1st quarter	2nd quarter	3rd quarter   j   4th quarter1954 ...... 1955 ...... 1956 ...... 1957 ......	127 135 137 137	129 136 137 139	131                   133 136                   140 136                   136 139                   139i8. From 1956 to 1957 the increase in output came mainly from theengineering and allied industries, though this was mainly a recovery fromthe fall in the previous year ; in 1957 as a whole the output of these industrieswas slightly lower than in 1955. The production of passenger cars recoveredin the spring with the rise in demand both at home and abroad and in thethird and fourth quarters it reached a record level ; for 1957 as a whole the number of. cars produced was 22 per cent higher than in 1956, andthree-fifths of the increase was exported.19. In general steel was no longer a limiting factor on the production ofthe engineering and allied industries in 1957.  The output of steel reachedper cent more than ina new high level of 2i-7 million tons in 19571956. Coal output, too, went up a little in 1957 and consumption wentdown, partly because of the mild weather early in 1957 and partly becauseof increased fuel efficiency. As a result imports of both coal and steel were much reduced.20. The volume of work done by the building industry was the same in1957 as a whole as in 1956. The output of the distributive trades and oftransport and other services increased.21. Agricultural production is expected to reach a new high level in the crop year 1957-58, siightly above that of 1956-57. The yield of most farmcrops was lower in 1957-58 than in 1956-57, mainly because of bad weatherbut this fall is likely to be more than offset by the large increase in livestock products.Imports(See Table 8 in Appendix A)22. Imports of goods and services were 3 per cent higher in real terms in 1957 than in 1956. The volume of merchandise imports landed in thiscountry was 3-i per cent higher but if allowance is made for imports delayedfrom 1956 by the closing of the Suez Canal the increase was only about 2 per cent. In 1957 stocks of imported commodities rose substantially, whereas in 1956 they fell. It is estimated that this change in investment in stocksaccounted for about two-thirds the recorded increase in imports between 1956and 1957.23. Imports of food, drink and tobacco in 1957 were just over 4 per cent higher than in 1956, mainly because of stock changes. Imports of fuel fellslightly ; coal imports were down, and although oil stocks were replenishedafter the interruption of supplies at the beginning of the year, there was onlya slight increase in imports over the year as a whole. Imports of basic materials were 4 per cent higher in 1957. Imports of semi-manufactures were only one per cent higher, but within the total iron and steel imports were
index of industrial ProductionChart 3nearly halved ; excluding them the increase was about 11 per cent. There wasa large increase in imports of finished manufactures both for consumption and for investment; they went up by 12 per cent, continuing the upward movement of earlier years.Employment(See Tables 7 and 9 in Appendix A)24. The increase in output in 1957 was produced with only a small increasein manpower. In industries covered by the index of industrial production,output per man-year went up by l-l per cent. The slight decline in totalemployment which had begun at the end of 1956 continued in the early partof 1957 ; with the recovery of production in the summer the number of people in employment began to go up, but at the end of the year there were signs that it was falling again. The net result over the year was a slight increase incivil employment. Most of this increase took place in distribution and in themetals, engineering and allied industries ; there was a fall in employment in building and contracting, agriculture and government service. The numberof people employed in the manufacturing industries on defence productionfell during the year by nearly 150,000 or by roughly 20 per cent. The greatmajority of the people displaced found other jobs. In manufacturing lessshort-time was worked than in 1956, mainly because of the recovery in the vehicles industry. The amount of overtime worked was roughly the same asin 1956.
25. Although unemployment rose slightly during the year, the average level still remained low, about 14 per cent of all employees. Unemploymentincreased most in Scotland, Wales and South-West England and the mainindustries affected were building and contracting, agriculture and distribution.The number of unfilled vacancies fell from 279,000 in December,1956, to 236,000 in December. 1957. Although this was a smaller fall thanin 1956, the last figure is the lowest since the winter of 1952-53. The numbersof vacancies for skilled engineering workers also fell during the year but less, proportionately, than total vacancies.National Income and Expenditure(See Table 1 in Appendix A)26. So far this chapter has dealt with the changes that took place in 1957in the output and distribution of goods and services, valued at constant prices. The following paragraphs discuss the income and expenditure ofdifferent parts of the economy at current prices ; first, the accounts of persons and unincorporated businesses ; secondly those of companies ; thirdly, thoseof the Government, local authorities and public corporations. From 1956to 1957 domestic incomes rose by over 6 per cent, more than three times theincrease in real output. The two chief kinds, income from employment andgross trading profits, maintained their share of the total, while the incomes ofself-employed persons increased less than the average. In 1956 and 1957these incomes were as follows :  million	1956	1957Income from employment    ............... Income from self-employment(&apos;)     ............ Gross trading profits of companies and public corporations^) Other income(&apos;) less Stock appreciation	12,222 1,697 3,334 852 - 150	12,940 1,729 3,525 886 -75Gross domestic product       ...............	17,955	19,029(&apos;) Before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation.Personal Income and Expenditure(see Table 10 in Appendix A)27. Personal incomes rose by  870 million, or 5 per cent, from 1956 to1957. Wages and salaries, which make up two-thirds of the total, wentup by about 6 per cent mainly because of an increase of nearly 5\ per centin average wage-rates ; rent, dividends and interest rose by 4 per cent;income from self-employment went up by 3 per cent (which includes a rise of about 6 per cent in farmers&apos; incomes). An additional  150 million was paid by persons in taxes and national insurance contributions, making theincrease in disposable incomes  720 million or 5 per cent. Consumers&apos; ex-penditure is estimated to have risen in the same proportion although, as stated earlier, the real increase in consumption was only 2 per cent. Thisleft a balance of personal saving of nearly  1,600 million, or 10 per cent of personal income after tax. This is an extremely high proportion comparedwith most past years ; it was first reached in 1956 when consumers&apos; ex-penditure was checked by the stiffening of hire purchase regulations and

No complete account can be given of the changes in assets correspond-ing to these personal savings in 1957. But it is known that well over  500million went to increase life assurance funds and those of pension schemes ;personal bank deposits less advances, rose by  153 million ; the funds heldin National Savings rose by  70 million ( 41 million lent to the Governmentand about  30 million deposits in the Special Investments Departments ofthe Trustee Savings Banks). Investment by persons in new houses and bysmall businesses amounted to some  650 million.Company profits and investment(see Table 11 in Appendix A)29. Industrial and trading companies as a whole increased their invest-ment nither more than their saving in 1957. Their profits increased byabout  190 million or 5 per cent ; their dividend and interest paymentsrose by  75 million ; although tax payments went up by about  120 millionthere was little change in the taxes accruing on the income earned in each
year. Companies increased their gross investment in fixed capital and in stocks at home by an estimated  175 million.   They also invested abroad.Government and Public Corporations(see Table 12 in Appendix A)30. The revenue of the Government rose by about  350 million or 6 percent in 1957. The main increase was in the yield from taxes on incomebut there was also an increase in the yield from taxes on expenditure.Current expenditure rose by 2 per cent ; the surplus on revenue accountwas  636 million compared with  398 million in 1956. Current expenditureon goods and services, which constitutes rather less than half the total,was unchanged, but the cost of the agricultural price guarantees went up,chiefly because of lower market prices, and there were increases in grants to local authorities to meet the rising cost of education and other social services. These grants amounted to  589 million, nearly as much as the yield of local rates.31. The biggest item in the capital account of the Government is its lendingto public corporations. In 1957 no less than  598 million was advanced inthis way, and a further  63 million was lent to local authorities.  200million was required to meet the Governmenfs own capital expenditure,mainly on the Post Office and atomic energy. Total capital expenditure by theGovernment was thus  862 million ; this was financed partly by the revenuesurplus of  636 million and partly by receipts from other sources, includingsmall savings ; in total these sums exceeded  862 million so it was possible tomake a small reduction in the market debt outstanding.32. Over the six years 1951 to 1957 current expenditure by the Govern-ment. excluding national insurance benefits, has risen by 30 per cent. Thisis about the same as the rise in the general level of prices over the period.As a proportion of the gross national product.

85Monetary Developments(see Tables 14 and 15 in Appendix A)34. Monetary policy was directed in 1957, as in other recent years, to maintaining the value of sterling in international transactions, to keepingche growth of spending at home within proper bounds and to fosteringpaving. It did not prove possible to prevent a considerable increase inthe quantity of bank deposits. The net deposits of the clearing banks roseby  211 million during 1957, the largest increase since 1953. This was mainlyassociated with an increase of  173 million in their liquid assets, although their investments rose by  69 million. Taking the year as a whole, theincrease in liquid assets did not reflect a growth in Government borrowing from the market by means of Treasury bills. As indicated in paragraph 31,the Government on balance redeemed securities to a small extent in 1957.The increased bank and discount market holdings of Treasury bills was accompanied by a decline in the holdings, including overseas holdings, of treasury bills outside the banks. But in the last quarter of the year, whenthe clearing banks&apos; liquid assets rose sharply, by  385 million, there was amarked growth in Government borrowing through Treasury bills. Thiswas largely a result of the seasonal budget deficit, the maturity in Novemberof Serial Funding Stock and an increase in the foreign exhange reserves.The banks continued to follow a restrictive policy on advances. Advancesfell by  32 million in 1957 compared with a rise of  62 million in 1956.The banks agreed in September to try to hold the average level of advancesduring the next twelve months at the average level for the preceeding twelvemonths, subject to the exclusion of medium-term advances guaranteed by theExport Credit Guarantees Department.35. The trend of interest rates including the Treasury bill rate was down-ward when the year opened. Prices of ordinary shares had risen well abovethe low level reached during the crisis in the Middle East in the previousautumn. Gilt-edged prices too had recovered from the losses incurred atthat time and the level reached by early February probably also reflectedan anticipation of a further decline in short-term interest rates. It became apparent that, while economic conditions did not warrant easier availability of credit generally, effective credit and funding policies could be sustained,for the time being, at a lower level of short-term rates. AccordinglyBank Rate was reduced from 5\ per cent to 5 per cent early in February.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasized that this reduction should notbe intepreted as a change in monetary policy.36. The reduction was followed by a further decline in short-term interest rates but not in the yield from medium and long dated stock. Prices ofgilt-edged securities fell considerably from March to September, while pricesof ordinary shares rose. This divergence reflected widespread anxiety aboutthe course of wages and prices and about the international position of sterling. In September, 1957, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announcednew measures to restrain home demand and Bank Rate was raised from5 per cent to 7 per cent. Short-term interest rates rose steeply ; long-termrates only slightly ; the prices of ordinary shares fell sharply. Confidencegradually revived and by the end of the year interest rates were againtending to fall. The higher rates paid on deposit accounts with the banksled to an increase of nearly  300 million in these accounts in the last three-and-a-half months of the year.15
cent.CHAPTER IICOSTS AND PRICES(See Table 16 in Appendix A)38. Although the pressure of demand was further reduced in 1957, costs and prices continued to rise. The average increase in prices was indeedsmaller than in most post-war years but as it came after a long upward move-ment it was more than enough to cause serious concern both at home andabroad. Prices of total final output of goods and services(&apos;) and wholesale prices of non-food manufacturing output were both 3 per cent higher on average in 1957 than in 1956 ; but from 1949 to 1956 they each rose by anaverage of 4-1 per cent per year. There has been a similar movement in retail^rices: &quot;in 1957 they were 3J per cent higher on average than in 1956,which compares with an average increase of 5 per cent per year from 1949to 1956. Export prices were, on average. 4-i per cent higher in 1957 than in1956.Costs and Prices in the Whole Economy39. From 1956 to 1957 about nine-tenths of the increase in the average price of total final output was a result of the rise in home costs. The restof the increase came from a rise in taxes on expenditure (including higherlocal rates) ; the average level of import costs was hardly any higher than in(&apos;) That is, goods and services available tor private and public consumption and invest-ment, and for export.37. This account of expenditure, output and income in 1957 can be broadlysummarised as follows:(i) There were moderate increases in home production and in imports,mainly because of the continuing growth of investment in plant and machinery, the increase in stocks and the revival of consumers&apos;, ,\demand for durable household goods and cars.(ii) These increases do not appear to have strained the economy ; theadditional production was achieved with only a small increase in manpower ; home supplies of coal and steel were generally suffi-cient; in addition, in view of the higher rate of fixed investment inrecent years, there should be capacity available to meet efficientlyincreases in demand whether at home or abroad.(iii) The high rate of personal saving and the Governments large surpluson revenue, account helped to maintain the general balance of the economy.(iv) Exports did not make an increased demand on resources in 1957 ;this is disappointing considering the productive resources availablein the economy at large.(v) But the most unsatisfactory feature in the home situation in 1957was that prices continued to rise ; thus the increase in consumers&apos;expenditure was 5 per cent but the increase in volume of consump-tion was 2 per cent : the increase in the cost of gross fixed invest-ment was 8 per cent but in real terms the increase was about 5 per
1956. The rise in the cost of each component and its contribution to the totalrise in price was as follows:		Percentage change in costs		Analysis of	per unit of output, 1956 to 1957		costs in 1957				Change	Contribution to	  million	in item	total changeIncome from employment ...	12,940	4- 4i	75Gross trading profits and other trading			incomeC)...............	6,174	+ 2$	15Residual error	-85		Total home costs	19,029	+ 3*	90Imports of goods and services    ......	4,395	-	-Net taxes on expenditure ...	2,531	4- 3	10Final output ...	25,955	-r 3	100(&apos;) Made up as follows: gross trading profits of companies:  3,185 million, gross tradingsurpluses of public corporations:  340 million, gross profits of other public enterprises:  140million, income from self-employment:  1,753 million, rent:  831 million, less stock apprecia-tion:  75 million.Home costs40. There was a rise in income from employment per unit of output from1956 to 1957 because wages and salaries went up faster than output. as stated in paragraph 27 above the total wage and salary bill was about per cent higher in 1957 than in 1956 ; real output was 1  per cent higher soincome from employment per unit of output went up by 4i per cent.41. Gross trading profits and other trading income(&apos;) also went up morethan real output ; the result was that per unit of output they rose 2-\ percent. The combined result of these increases in wages, salaries and tradingincome was that home costs per unit of output were 3J per cent higher in1957 than in 1956.Import Costs42. Although prices of imported goods and services(2) fell in the second half of 1957. for the year as a whole the average was about the same asin 1956. Import prices as defined here exclude changes in freights charged by British shipping companies ; if all freights are included, import prices,measured c.i.f., were on average 2 per cent higher in 1957 than in 1956 butthey fell 8 per cent during 1957. Most of this fall took place in the second half of the year ; in the first half import prices were still at the high level which followed the closing of the Suez Canal.Timing43. This analysis is necessarily incomplete because it normally takes sometime for changes in costs to work their way through to final prices. Forimport prices of raw materials, in particular, the average delay is probablyseveral months. Thus up to the end of 1957 final prices were probablystill tending, to reflect the higher import costs during the early part of theyear, rather than the later fall. For wage-rates most of the increase in 1957took place in the first half of the year and had therefore probably workedits way through to final prices by the end of the year.(&apos;) Excluding stock appreciation.(2) This is an average value or currently weighted price index.17
Costs and Prices in ManufacturingC)44 It is possible to make &quot;a more detailed analysis of changes in costs and prices in manufacturing (which contributes about two-fifths of the tolagross domestic product).  The changes in costs of labour and materials andin final prices of manufactured products have been as follows:percentage change over previous year	1953	1954	1955	1956	1957Labour costs Output per man-year...... Annual earnings per employee Costs per unit ot&quot; output	4- 6 4 6	4 6 4 6	4 4 4 S 4 4	- 2 4 8 410	4 2 4 6 4 4Costs of materials Wholesale   prices   of,   basic materials (excluding fuel) ...

45. From 1956 to 1957 the increase in labour costs per unit of output in manufacturing was much smaller than from 1955 to 1956. Average output per man fell in 1956 because in many industries the fall in demand and out-put was not matched by a proportionate reduction in the labour force. by contrast, in 1957 output in manufacturing went up 2 per cent and there was virtually no change in employment.46. From 1955 to 1956 costs of labour and materials per unit of output in manufacturing industries rose more than final prices, so that profit marginsfell slightlyC). On the other hand, from 1956 to 1957 the costs of materialswere substantially unchanged ; labour and material costs combined, per unit of output, probably rose no more than the prices of final output so thatthere was probably little change in profit-margins. These estimates refer to manufacturing industries as a whole ; there may well have been widedifferences in the experiences of individual industries.47. In December 1957, the average cost of basic materials (mainlyimported) used in non-food manufacturing was 7 per cent below the average for the year ; it seems unlikely that there will be an upturn in the immediatefuture. There may. therefore, be scope for price reductions in some industries provided that the lower cost of materials is not offset by increases in labour costs. Already, in the final quarter of 1957, wholesale prices ofnon-food manufactures had ceased to rise. The index of these pricesremained constant at 142 (June 1949=100) after an almost uninterruptedrise since the beginning of 1954, when it was 125.Retail Prices(See Table 17 in Appendix A)48. From 1956 to 1957 the pattern of increases in retail prices was rather different from that of earlier years: prices of food went up less than inmost other years whereas rent and rates went up more. The main changesin retail prices have been as follows:percentage change	Weight in retail prices index Jan. 1956	Annual Average 1949-1956	Annual Average 1956-1957	Jan. 1957 to Jan.1958Food............	35	-i- 8	+ 2-1-	+HManufactures (&apos;)   ......	38	+ 2$	+ 2-i	+ 1Rent, rates, etc.......	9	+ 3*	+ 1	+ 12Other (:)    .........	18	-i- 6	-i- 6i	4-5*All retail prices     ......	100	f 5	+ 3i	4-3*(&apos;) Alcoholic drink, tobacco, household goods, clothing and other goods.(:) Fuel, light, transport and services.49. The increase in retail prices during 1957 was 3-1 per cent thesame as the increase between the yearly averages for 1956 and 1957.Food prices rose by IV per cent on average: in the first few months of 1957they were falling and for a time they were lower than in 1956 ; from may to July, however, they rose quite sharply, mainly because of seasonal factors,(&apos;) In the table in paragraph 44 above, costs are defined in relation to the input pricesruling in the year in question, with no allowance for any time lag between purchases ofinputs and sales of output. Profit margins here arc taken to be the difference between sellingprices and costs so defined, expressed as a ratio of turnover; they are therefore calculatedafter deducting stock appreciation. Gross profits are normally calculated before deductingstock appreciation.19
but after that they fell back, partly as a result of lower import prices. Pricesof manufactured goods, taken together, were only one per cent higher at theend of 1957 than at the beginning. There were, however, material increases in prices of fuel, light and services and in rent and rates, in the second halfof the year.Export Prices50. Export prices of merchandise were, on average. 4\ per cent higher in 1957 than in 1956. but the upward movement, which had been going onsince 1954, stopped in the third quarter of 1957. In January, 1958, the exportprice index at 110 (1954=100) was fractionally lower than in the second halfof 1957 and only one per cent higher than a year earlier. The recent slightdecline mainly reflected a fall in export prices of foodstuffs, petroleum andbasic materials ; the export prices of metals were still rising but prices ofother manufactured goods had ceased to rise. These changes in the UnitedKingdom export price index have been as follows:Indices, 1954 = 100	Manufactured goods				All U.K. exports	Metals	Engineer-ing products	1 Textiles (excluding clothing)	Other	1957-1st half     ......	115	110	101      1	106	no2nd half   ......	116	114	102	107	111October    ......	117	113	104	107	111November ...	117	114	102	107	111December......	117	115	102	106	1111958 January    ......	118	114	102 1	105	110Summary51. This account of costs and prices in 1957 can be summarised as follows:(i) In the economy as a whole, income from employment went upfaster than output so there was a further increase in unit labour costs ; gross profits per unit of output also went up though by a lesser amount.(ii) These increases were the main cause of the rise in the general levelof prices.(iii) Retail prices were 34- per cent higher on average in 1957 than in1956 ; food prices rose much less than in recent years but rent and rates rose more.(iv) Export prices were on average 41 per cent higher than in 1956 ;they were rising in 1956 and in &quot;the first half of 1957; but theystopped rising in the third quarter of 1957.(v) Import prices (c.i.f.) were 2 per cent higher on average in 1957 thanin 1956 but there was a sharp fall in the second half of the year ; themain effect of this fall on retail prices should be felt in 1958.
p..CHAPTER IIIOVERSEAS TRADE AND PAYMENTSWorld Background52. The United Kingdom has an &quot;open&quot; economy : its economic life isclosely linked with the oustide world in many different ways. Developmentsoverseas can have a profound influence upon it. Before examining thebalance of payments in 1957 and the prospects for 1958, therefore, it isessential to consider the broad trends in the world economy as a whole.Three developments were outstanding in 1957. First, the rate of growth in world trade and production showed signs of slowing down ; by the fourthquarter the United States economy was in recession. Secondly, and asso-ciated with the slower industrial growth, commodity prices fell. Thirdly,there was a sharp decrease in the external monetary reserves of most countries, apart from the United States and Germany.-World Production and Trade53. Although world industrial production continued to expand throughout1957 the rate of growth was slower than in 1956. In the United States, asin the United Kingdom, output was only a little higher than in the previous year. In most other Western European countries production rose sharplyin the first quarter of 1957, partly because of the mild winter, but in anumber of the smaller European countries output decreased later on. InFrance, on the other hand, industrial production rose throughout the year.In Germany, although industrial production rose sharply in the first quarterof 1957, the rate of growth slowed down in the rest of the year. In Japanproduction continued to increase rapidly although there, too, the rate of expansion was below that of the previous year. A recession in the UnitedStates began in the fourth quarter : industrial output, after reaching a peakat the end of 1956, had remained virtually unchanged during the first nine months of 1957. but in the last three months it fell to a level about 5 percent below that of a year earlier ; the largest falls were in the productionof metals, motor vehicles and machinery.54. In 1957 as in 1956, world trade rose more rapidly than world pro-duction. In the first half of the year the rate of growth in world trade was as fast as in 1956 but it slowed down considerably in the second half of theyear. The trade of manufacturing countries, which had been expandingrapidly until the middle of 1957, rose by only a small amount in the thirdquarter ; and in the fourth quarter it was no higher than a year earlier.Exports from the primary producing countries also fell off in the last quarterof 1957 but imports into these countries continued to increase.Commodity Prices55. As a result of the slower industrial expansion, the demand for primary products did not rise as much as the supply, and the prices of manycommodities fell during 1957. The largest falls were in prices of non-ferrous metals and wool. Prices of foodstuffs, on the other hand, were more stable ;the exceptions were cocoa prices which increased towards the end of the year,and prices of coffee and dairy produce which decreased. The fall in com-commodity prices caused a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade of several2130824 A 8
overseas sterling area countries. At the same time imports of many of thesecountries rose steeply in the second half of the year. Australia^ balance ofpayments, which had improved in 1956, worsened in the last six months of1957. New import restrictions were imposed by New Zealand at the endof the year. India also introduced import restrictions but, because of herdevelopment plans, the steep rise in imports continued in 1957.Monetary Reserves56. During 1957 many countries outside the United States and Germanysuffered serious losses of external reserves. Holdings of gold, dollars and sterling are the main components of international liquidity, the means bywhich the imbalances of international trade and payments are settled. the adequacy of the total of such liquidity and its distribution are important to the smooth How of international trade. In recent years liquidity has declined in relation to trade and this is making it harder for many countries to meet temporary deficits. Figures for the decline in overseas sterling holdings are given below, but there has been a decline recently in the gold and dollar holdings of the non-dollar world (excluding Germany) as well.In the twelve months from September. 1956 (when the losses began) to september. 1957. the non-dollar world, apart from Germany, lost aboutSI.500 million. Losses would have been larger but for drawings on theInternational Monetary Fund which amounted to $1,000 million in thisperiod. French losses were particularly heavy and were followed by theexchange adjustment in the summer. The large-scale movements of reservesslowed down in the fourth quarter of 1957.57. Many factors were involved in these losses and they cannot easily bedisentangled from each other. The main one was that the build-up ofGerman reserves, which had continued since 1951 (as a result of the persistentGerman trade surplus) coincided with a reversal of the gold and dollaroutflow from the United States. In the five years up to 1956 this outflowhad added about SI.000 million a year to the rest of the world&apos;s reserves.Behind this change was an expansion in the United States&apos; visible tradesurplus and a sharp rise in receipts of short-term funds by the United Statesbecause of a loss of confidence in other currencies. The absorption of reserves by Germany was aggravated in the middle of 1957 by large-scalecapital movements in favour of the mark.58. The main effect of these events on the United Kingdom economy in 1957 was that the current account gained from the fall in commodity prices and the capital account lost through the unfavourable balance ofpayments of the rest of the sterling area and through short-term capital movements provoked by the exchange adjustment of the franc.United Kingdom Balance of Payments(See Tables 5, IS, 19 in Appendix A and paragraphs 1-9 in Appendix B)Current Account59. United Kingdom exports to non-sterling markets continued to risein 1957 though less than in 1956 and exports to the rest of the sterling area revived after a period of little change. As stated in paragraph 14above, the total volume of exports was only 2 per cent higher in 1957 thanin 1956 whereas the increase in the volume of imports was 3% per cent.
Chart 7Terms of trade represent the import price index as a percentage of the export price index; a fall is favourable.But the terms of trade moved 3 per cent in favour of the United Kingdombecause of the steep fall in import prices from May onwards and the risein export prices in the first nine months of the year. As a result the tradedeficit only rose from  568 million in 1956 to  617 million in 1957. Thetrade deficit is the excess of imports (c.i.f.) over exports and re-exports(f.o.b.) on a Trade Accounts basis. Balance of payments estimates aremade on a rather different basis. (Broadly, the difference between esti-mates made on the two bases arises from differences of coverage, timing and valuation ; in particular imports are treated for trade purposes c.i.f.but in the balance of payments f.o.b. ; this is explained fully in the footnoteto Table 19 in Appendix A.) The deficit on visible trade in balance ofp;o-3ents terms was  97 million in 1957,  36 million more than in 1956but still less than in any other post-war year.60. As usual the United Kingdom had a large surplus on invisible transaction-tions and this more than covered the deficit on visible trade. The surplus oninvisibles rose further, from  327 million in 1956 to  334 million in 1957,mainly as a result of higher earnings from shipping and oil and a reductionof net Government overseas expenditure. Oil earnings fell in the first halfof 1957 from tihe already low level of the second half of 1956 because ofthe interruption in Middle East supplies, but they recovered buoyantly in thesecond half of 1957.  Net earnings from interest, profits and dividends were

61. As the preceding table shows, the overall surplus on current account(including defence aid) came to  237 million in 1957 as compared with  266million in 1956. The improvement in invisible income was outweighed bythe increase in the deficit on visible trade, but the result for the year was stillone of the larger current surpluses since the war. (The estimates for thesecond half of 1957 are still provisional and subject to later revision.)62. There were certain special features in the situation. One part of thesurplus was a result of the postponement of interest due on the north american loans. Another part was the result of the improvement in theterms of trade already referred to, and this is likely, if not immediately, atleast in time to reflect upon our exports : the loss of export revenue byprimary producing countries will probably reduce their ability to buy goods from overseas. Moreover, as the events of August and September 1957showed only too clearly, even a current surplus of the above order does notin itself prevent a severe exchange crisis. To explain the reasons for this it is necessary to examine carefully the long and short-term overseas capitalaccounts which were in 1957 of peculiar complexity.Current and Long-Terin Capital Position63. The United Kingdom&apos;s balance of current and long-term capital trans-actions with all other countries has been as follows:  million	1955	1956	1957 (provi-sional)	1956		1957					Jan.-June	July-Dec.	Jan.-June	July-Dec, (provi-sional)Current balance.........	- 69	4-266	4-237	+ 168	4- 98	+ 115	+ 122Long-term investment transaction-tions (net): (outflow -)	-203	-231	-189	- 74	-157	-168	- 21Balance of current transactions and long-term investment	-272	+ 35	+ 48	+ 94	- 59	- 53	+ 101In the 1957 Survey this balance was referred to as the &quot; commercial account &quot;,on the general assumption that the long-term capital transactions included init were of a more distinctly &quot; commercial&quot; or normal &quot; trading &quot; kind thanthe other overseas capital transactions shown in the United Kingdonfsoverseas accounts. In order to appreciate the commercial account in 1957,however, some explanation is needed of several long-term capital movements.64. In the first half of 1957 there was a marked rise in the flow ofcapital into non-sterling securities through free markets in the sterling area.This movement, which was brought under control by new regulations at thebeginning of July, was associated with a weakening of confidence. Inaddition, in the second half of the year, the small size of the usual deficit on long-term capital account arose mainly from Government transactions : first the drawing of  89 million from the Export-Import Bank line of credit; secondlythe arrangements made with the United States and Canadian governments to defer capital repayment on their loans which saved  26 million on long-term capital account (in addition to the interest saving on current account
referred to in paragraph 60).. Apart from these particular transactions it isbelieved that the long-term capital outflow was at much the same levelin 1957 as in other recent years.65. In a year of tighter monetary conditions in the United Kingdom,the traditional flow of private capital to the Colonies was maintained, asfar as can be seen, at a level comparable with that in the past. Assistance ,from the Government to underdeveloped Colonial territories, for whom theUnited Kingdom has special responsibilities, continued and expenditurethrough grants (reflected in the current account) and loans was higher thanthat of previous years. By direct assistance to Colonial territories and indirect assistance through regional and international organisations to otherunderdeveloped countries, the United Kingdom played an important partin their continuing economic progress and development.Reserves and Liabilities66. During 1957 there were complex developments in the overseas monetary position which are shown in the table on the opposite page. It is at first sight strange that, in the first half of the year when the balance of current and long-term capital transactions, as defined above, was in deficit to theextent of some  53 million, the reserves rose by  88 million, while in thesecond half, when there was a surplus on current and long-term capital account of  101 million, they fell by  38 million. A variety of factorsexplain these apparently paradoxical movements.First Half: Improvement67. In the first half of the year the miscellaneous capital and the errorsand omissions item (which balances the accounts) were, taken together,favourable, perhaps partly as a result of the return of unidentified short-term funds withdrawn during the Middle-Eastern crisis at the end of 1956.Moreover, the  37 million of dollars due for the interest payments on theNorth American loans, which were taken out of the reserves and placedin special accounts at the end of 1956 (while negotiations for the revisionof the original agreements proceeded), were returned to the reserves inApril following the completion of new agreements with the United Statesand Canadian Governments. In so far as this sum represents a debt pay-ment which has been postponed and not cancelled, this receipt can beregarded as in a sense a long-term borrowing. Finally, although the sterling holdings of non-sterling countries scarcely changed over this half year,those of the rest of the sterling area increased by  69 million ; one majortransaction, a drawing upon the International Monetary Fund by India,was particularly important.68. Thus, in the first half of 1957 the effect which the current and long-term capital deficit of  53 million might have been expected to have uponthe reserves was more than offset by other capital movements, particularly those described above, so that the reserves went up (by  88 million) insteadof down.

Third Quarter: Deterioration69. In the second half of 1957, however, the course of the reserveswas dominated by the deterioration in the position of the rest of the sterling area and by the pressure on sterling in August and September. In this partof the year, for seasonal reasons, the export earnings of countries in therest of the sterling area are&apos;normally low. In 1957 the seasonal trend wasaccentuated by the worsening of the balance of payments position of mostof these countries, because of the fall in commodity prices and the rise in imports, so that their sterling holdings fell by  226 million over the second half of the year.70. Meantime, during August, a readjustment of French exchange arrange-ments, with the effect of a partial devaluation of the franc, set off an intensewave of currency speculation in Europe. It was believed that the deutsche-mark was about to be revalued and that in a general realignment of paritiessterling might be depreciated. This belief was strengthened first, by the factthat Germany had been for some years increasing her reserves and had apersistently favourable balance of trade and secondly, by growing doubts,here as well as abroad, about the trend in wages and prices in this country.Consequently funds were withdrawn from London very rapidly and on avery large scale. The reserves fell by  185 million in August and September.Large deficits were incurred in the European Payments Union ; the september deficit which, in accordance with normal arrangements, had to besettled in October, cost a further  48 million in gold and dollars in that month.Fourth Quarter: Recovery71. The new policy measures announced on 19th September and theemphatic statements about exchange rate policy made by the Chancellorof the Exchequer during and after the meeting of the International monetary fund, as well as statements by the German authorities, brought the waveof speculation to an abrupt end. In October, even excluding the drawingfrom the Export-Import Bank, the reserves had almost stopped falling ;including that drawing they rose by  86 million ; in November and Decemberthey rose by a further  65 million. (Further large gains in the early weeks of 1958 brought them, by the end of February, to the highest level sincemid-1955.)72. During the last quarter of 1957, the sterling holdings of non-sterling countries (other than those reported to the European Payments Union andsettled month by month through its mechanism) were partly rebuilt, so thatat the end of December they were only  19 million less than they hadbeen at the end of June (though they included  674- million in respectof funds accumulated by the German Government against future debt repay-ments). As indicated in paragraph 64 special measures were taken tostrengthen the reserves: in October by drawing  89 million of the Export-Import Bank line of credit, and in December by postponing the annualservice of the North American loans, which amounted altogether to  63million. In the end, therefore, although the sterling holdings of overseas countries fell by  227 million in the second half of the year, the reservesfell by &quot;only  38 million; on 31st December, 1957, they amounted to  812million.
73. Thus, taking 1957 as a whole, the United Kingdom had a surplus onthe balance of current and long term investment transactions (including thespecial measures referred to), of about the same size as in 1956. Becauseof this and because of receipts of miscellaneous capital and a large positiveerrors and omissions item in the accounts (which points to unidentifiedreceipts of either a current or capital nature), it was possible to end theyear with both larger reserves and a big fall in overseas monetary liabilities ;i.e. the overseas monetary position was significantly strengthened.Rest of the Sterling Area74. If allowance is made for the free market security transactions referredto in paragraph 64, in the first half of 1957 the rest of the sterling area hada deficit on current and long-term capital account with the United Kingdom ;this by itself would have caused a fall in their sterling holdings. The areaalso had a deficit on current account with the non-sterling world. however the area&apos;s gold production and capital receipts amply covered their deficitsboth with the United Kingdom and with the rest of the world so that, inthe normal procedures of the sterling area, their sterling holdings increasedby  69 million through the transfer of large net sums of gold and non-sterlingearnings to London.75. In the second half of 1957, however, the position of countries inthe rest of the sterling area deteriorated (for the reasons stated in para-graph 69) ; as a result their deficit with the United Kingdom increased andtheir gold production and non-sterling capital receipts were not enoughto cover their current deficit with non-sterling countries. Hence, they were compelled to draw  226 million from their sterling holdings to cover thesedeficits. Over the year as a whole their transfers of gold and non-sterlingearnings were substantially less than in 1956  72 million in place of  161million and their sterling holdings fell by  157 million.Summary76. This account of the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments in 1957has necessarily been complicated but the story can be broadly summarisedas follows:(i) Our current surplus was substantial, though somewhat lower thanin 1956.(ii) Our traditional private investment overseas continued on alarge scale.(iii) Because our surplus was primarily with countries of the restof the sterling area (and was indeed partly the obverse of theirbalance of payments difficulties), it led to a reduction in our sterlingliabilities to them rather than to a rise in the reserves.(iv) Moreover, both the pressure on sterling in the autumn and thebalance of payments difficulties in the non-sterling world led to arunning down of sterling holdings by non-sterling countries and thiscaused a big reduction in the reserves in August and September.
-    100(v) Thus, had it not been for special capital transactions, described inparagraph 64, the year would have ended not only with a reductionin sterling liabilities, but also with a large fall in the reserves.However, because of these operations it was possible actually toincrease the reserves over the year and to meet a big reduction inthe short-term liabilities. But medium and long-term dollarliabilities were incurred.  (vi) In other words as traders and investors we had a moderately satis-factory year, but in our third role as international bankers we were obliged to borrow to meet unusually large calls upon us by ourclients.CHAPTER iv the PRESENT POSITION77. In the past two years the pressure of demand on productive resourceshas been gradually easing. Although industrial production in 1957 wasonly slightly higher than in 1955, the high investment which has been going on for several years in most industries should provide a store of capacity for further expansion. The shortages of manpower are less serious thanin previous years ; unemployment, at an average of 1-9 per cent, is only slightly higher than a year ago, although there are areas of heavier unem-ployment. Home supplies of coal and steel are generally sufficient and imports of both have been much reduced. There has also been a reduction,in real terms, in the demands on the economy made by the Governmentscurrent expenditure. Thus the economic climate is less inflationary than for several years, and this change has been reflected in the increasedconfidence in sterling.78. The change in the trend of world economic activity is bound tobe of great importance for the United Kingdom in 1958. The United StatesGovernment have expressed their confidence that the current recession in theUnited States need not be prolonged, and the records of 1948-49 and1953-54 give grounds for confidence in their ability to prevent any seriousdecline. However, there are other circumstances which give grounds for anxiety. Whereas in 1953 the rest of the world was gaining gold and dollar reserves from the United States on a substantial scale, in 1957 most countries were losing reserves (Germany is a notable exception) ; their ability to ride out a period of difficulty without taking special measures toprotect themselves has thus been weakened. Secondly, there is the sub-stantial fall in certain commodity prices ; although this is partly a reaction from the unusually high level of recent years, it is imposing a strain on the trade balances of some primary producing countries. Thirdly,world industrial production is likely to be lower in the first half of 1958than in the first half of 1957, because the recession in the United states is not likely on this occasion to be outweighed by expansion in Europe asit was in 1953.
Problems of 195879. Such is the background to the problems which are likely to confrontthe United Kingdom economy in 1958. The first problem is costs and prices. The price movements in the United Kingdom in 1957 were examined in Chapter II; outstanding was the fall in import prices: at the end of1957 they were 8 per cent lower than at the beginning; most of the falltook place in the second half of 1957 and should be reflected to some extent in final prices in 1958. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 1957, wholesale prices of manufactured goods were stable and the long upward movementof United Kingdom export prices was checked.80. There is thus a good opportunity in 1958 to stop the rise in prices which has troubled the country for twenty years. This is very desirable for social and economic stability at home. Moreover, conditions in overseas markets are likely to be difficult, and United Kingdom manufacturers willbe able to succeed there only if they can keep prices down.81. It seems probable that the decrease in the pressure of demand inrelation to productive capacity, which took place in 1957, will continueinto 1958. As already noted, the rise in public investment, which was rapidin the second half of 1957, is to be checked in 1958. There will be little change, in real terms, in Government expenditure on goods and services.Present indications are that private fixed investment will increase lessthan in earlier years. The total pressure of demand will also depend on whether businesses continue to build up their stocks ; at present, there is little evidence about this, but it seems likely that investment in stocks will need fewer resources in 1958 than in 1957.82. Externally it may well prove that the United Kingdom will achieve asubstantial current surplus on its balance of payments in 1958. although in present world conditions there will be a hard struggle to increase and perhaps even to maintain exports, the fall in import prices will be favourableand progress should be made on invisible account. The ultimate effect onthe reserves, however, may be largely influenced by the difficulties whichworld developments are causing to the rest of the sterling area. Althoughworld activity is still high, nearly all the countries in the rest of the sterling area have suffered a loss of export earnings, and these earningsmay stay relatively depressed until world activity starts rising again.83. Many of these countries have already begun to draw heavily upon their accumulated sterling holdings so as to avoid too great a check totheir activity and the pace of their economic development ; some of them,however, have been obliged to enforce drastic limitations upon their imports. From one point of view these drawings by other sterling countries on sterling reserves held here are helpful to the United Kingdom, and othercountries. This process helps to maintain exports and thereby contributesto the defence of the United Kingdom and the world against a deflationaryspiral.84. At the same time, there has been a large fall in the rest of the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments surplus on current and capital accountwith the non-sterling world. This fall reduces the net flow of non-sterlingearnings which these countries habitually sell in London against sterling.They use this sterling to help meet their deficit with the United Kingdom ;the United Kingdom, in its turn, uses these non-sterling earnings to meet its own deficit on current and long-term capital account with the non-sterlingworld.  This is, indeed, the normal structure of the sterling area&apos;s payments.
85. In short, because the United kingdom&apos;s current trading position shouldbe good in 1958, the rest of the sterling area will be able to draw down their sterling balances without imposing too great a strain on the gold and dollar reserves. Sterling is strengthened by such a reduction of liabilitiesas well as by an increase in reserves.CONCLUSIONS86. The United Kingdom&apos;s economy is very closely affected by world economic developments. Both the level of employment and the standardof living in this country depend on international trade and cannot beisolated from outside events. Of necessity the United Kingdom&apos;s freedomof internal action is conditioned by its external financial position.87. In such circumstances, international co-operation in economic affairs is of special importance ; and the United Kingdom, because of its tradingposition and links with the sterling area, has an essential part to play.But, unless it is clear that the United Kingdom is economically strong and able to deal effectively with its own domestic problems, its influence in international economic affairs may be limited and slow to take effect.88. Thus the first objective of the United Kingdom in 1958 must be tomaintain the value of its currency. Good progress has been made in reducingthe pressure of demand on the economy and in strengthening the balanceof payments. But the stability of the currency at home has not yet beenfully secured and on this, ultimately, its external value depends. this objective must be attained if the economy is to expand.

First there are differences of coverage. Landingsby British Whale Fisheries and trade with the Channel Islands are excluded, whereas imports and exports of diamonds and all second-hand ships are included. These differences increasethe trade account figures for imports by   million and   million, and for exportsby   million and   million in 1956 and 1957 respectively. Secondly there are differences of valuation and timing, arising from the fact that the figures in this table represent earnings and expenditure, whereas the trade accounts record departures and arrivals. Charges for insurance and freight are in general here excluded from the value of imports; these differences,timing and other factors which cannot be separately evaluated decrease the trade accountfigUies of imports by   million in 1956 and   million in 1957. Timing and otherdifferences decrease the trade account figure for exports by   million in 1956 and  million in 1957.(2) Including defence aid.General Note.

APPENDIX BSURVEY OF EXPORTS AND OF) PARTICULAR INDUSTRIESEXPORTS(Tables 5 and 18 of Appendix A)1. In 1957 the total value of United Kingdom exports and re-exports was  3,458million, just over 4 per cent higher than in 1956. However these figures includeconsignments of silver bullion exported to Uniced States in 1956 and 1957 in repayment of lend-lease borrowing; they are also distorted by the effect of the 1954 dock strike.Allowing for the effects of these factors, the increase in the value of United kingdom exports in 1957 was about 5\ per cent, which was lower than in 1956 but much thesame as in 1954 and 1955. The increase in volume was just over 2 per cent, the lowestsince 1953. There was a marked change of trend in the fourth quarter of 1957 when,even after allowing for disturbances to shipping movements in 1956, United kingdom exports were no higher in volume than a year earlier.Commodity Composition2. United Kingdom exports once again increased less rapidly than world trade inmanufactured goods. For 1957 as a whole, the value of world exports of manufacturesincreased by 11 per cent, and United Kingdom exports of manufactures by 6 per cent..The expansion of world trade in manufactures however slowed down considerably inthe fourth quarter of 1957.3. In 1957 as a whole there were substantial increases in United Kingdom exportsof all the main commodities except textiles (which expanded only slightly) and fuels(which fell). Shipments of food, beverages and tobacco, basic materials, chemicals,metals and manufactures and engineering products were all substantially higher thanin 1956. Within the engineering products group, there was a particularly rapid expansion in exports of passenger cars. But exports of ships fell below the high levelof 1956, and exports of aircraft and engines increased by 10 per cent compared with60 per cent in 1956.4. The check to the growth of United Kingdom exports in the fourth quarter of1957 was also fairly widespread. The check to engineering exports was very slight,but exports of basic materials, metals, chemicals, textiles and of food, beverages and tobacco, were all lower, or only a little higher than a year earlier.Area Distribution5. United Kingdom exports to all the main currency areas rose in 1957; the increases in value ranged from 4 per cent to the sterling area to 10 per cent to the dollar area.(]) This was in striking contrast to 1956, when exports to the non-sterling world(particularly the dollar area) rose sharply and exports to the sterling area hardly roseat all.6. Exports to all parts of the dollar area United States, Canada and the rest of the dollar area rose at a slower rate than in 1956. There was, however, a rapid expansion of car exports to the United States; they were nearly two-and-a-half times as high as in 1956.7. The expansion in exports to European markets also slowed down in 1957. Therewas a marked contrast between the two halves of the year. In the first half exportsexpanded even faster than in 1956; there were large increases in shipments of machin-ery, chemicals, textiles, metals, basic materials and foodstuffs. In the second half ofthe year, however, exports were lower than in the second half of 1956. The slower rate of growth for the year as a whole reflects falls, or much smaller increases, in exports to France, the Netherlands, Norway and Greece, which were only partially(&apos;) All comparisons for the dollar area and the United States exclude consignments onlend-lease silver.
offset by the continued high rates of expansion in shipments to Western Germany andBelgium and a much more rapid increase to Italy.8. In 1957, exports to the test of the non-sterling world as a whole also grew-mo reslowly, but within this area the changes were varied. The expansion of shipments to non-dollar Latin America accelerated sharply exports rose by over a third, withparticularly big increases to Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. There was also somagincrease in exports to Japan for the year as a whole, but this was concentrated in th. first half of the year; in the second there was a very steep fall in our exports to this market. Although exports to Egypt fell to a very low level in 1957, increased ship-ments to other Middle East markets the Sudan, Iran, Israel and the Lebanon more than made up for this.9. The recovery of exports to the sterling area in 1957, after the stability of 1956,reflects a substantial increase in shipments to independent sterling area countries; by contrast, exports to the Colonies fell slightly. There was renewed expansion in exports to some important markets Australia, New Zealand and South Africa particularly in the second half of the year, and a big increase in shipments to the GulfStates. But the rapid expansion of exports to India which had been a feature of 1956died away in 1957. and by the end of the year they were lower than a year earlier.FUEL AND POWER10. In 1957 home consumption of fuel and power was nearly 8 million tons lower than in 1956:Million tons coal equivalent		1956	1957CoalO)        ...... Oil    ......... Hydro-electricity		215 38 1	208 37 1	Total.........	254	246(&apos;) Adjusted for exports and for stock changes of coke.The main reason for the reduced consumption was the weather, which was warmerthan average in most months of the year, particularly in February and March (whenfuel consumption is heavy); 1956 on the other hand was a cold year. In additionuntil May there was petrol rationing, which reduced the consumption of oil.Coal11. One and a half million tons more coal were produced in 1957 than in 1956.The whole of the increase came from opencast sites. Although 6,700 more men were employed in 1957, deep-mined output was no higher than in 1956. Absenteeismincreased sharply after 1st June when the bonus incentive to attendance was abolished and in the late autumn there was the influenza epidemic. Losses caused by disputeswere a little lower than in 1956. More people were recruited to the mines in 1957than in any year since 1952; the net increase in numbers was 6,300. The manpowerposition in the mines was therefore much improved by the end of the year.12. The amount of coal used in 1957 was lower than in 1956 by 5 million tons.There was an increase of 2 million tons in exports and stock changes of coke, so thathome use of coal really decreased by 7 million tons. This decrease occurred despite the fact that the Suez crisis prevented the planned increase in the use of oil at power stations. The warmer weather in 1957 probably saved between 3 million and5 million tons but the rest of the saving must have come partly from increased fuelefficiency, partly from the greater use of oil. Imports and exports of coal (includingships&apos; bunkers), were both about 2 million tons lower in 1957 than in 1956. At theyear&apos;s end imports had been reduced to a mere trickle. The net result, of the higheroutput and lower usage of coal was a large increase in stocks: they rose to thehighest level since before the war.

In 1957 the normal pattern of the oii trade in the United Kingdom was upset bythe disruption of supplies caused by the Suez crisis. In the early months imports fromthe Middle East were much less than normal and this reduction could only be partly offset by larger imporis from the Western Hemisphere and by drawing on stocks. Inconsequence, restrictions were imposed on home consumption of motor fuels, gas oiland fuel oil; however, because of the mild weather, these restrictions did not causegreat hardship. A period of adjustment followed, during which the depleted stocks were rebuilt, and for 1957 as a whole imports were slightly higher than in 1956.Exports were cut in the first half of 1957 but in the second half there was a markedrecovery. Similarly the net invisible income from oil transactions was down in thefirst half of the year; however, the Suez emergency proved less damaging than hadbeen expected and in the second half of the year normal trade patterns were resumed.14. Total production from the United Kingdom oil refineries in 1957 was 25 million tons, almost one million tons less than in 1956. For the first time for many yearshome deliveries were down: the total was a half-million tons lower than in 1956,partly as a result of the restrictions. There are many plans for increasing refinerycapacity, and port facilities for large tankers are being extended. Planning permissionhas been granted for developing oil facilities at Milford Haven.Gas15. The amount of gas used in 1957 was nearly 3 per cent less than in 1956; this reduction is also attributed to the mild weather. There was another marked increasein coke oven supplies to gasworks and the quantity of gas made at gasworks was
w&quot;    122reduced by 5 per cent. As part of their integration policies, Gas Boards completedseveral important gas grids which enabled a number of small and less efficient works to be closed. The industry continued its efforts to develop the use of raw materials in easier supply than gas coals. A development project which it is hoped will lead tothe gasification of low-grade coal by the hydrogenation process was approved and itwas decided to conduct an experiment in the ocean transport of liquefied natural gasFurther progress was also made with projects to convert liquid and gaseous refinerjBHsurpluses into town gas. A small but worthwhile source of natural gas at Cousland, inScotland, was harnessed, and additional supplies of methane drained from coal mines were absorbed by the gas industry.Coke16. There was a further expansion in coke production at coke ovens, but a reductionat gasworks; total coke production was just over one per cent higher in 1957 than in1956. Except at blast furnaces, the inland demand for coke was much lower than in1956. Exports were substantially increased but not enough to offset the fall in home demand. As a result there was a big rise in coke stocks both at gasworks andat coke ovens, which is shown in the following table:Million tons	1955	1956	1957Production (excluding gasworks&apos; own use)	29-0	30-7	31-1Disposals Inland...............	28-3	28-3	27-1Export...............	1-2	1-6	1-8Stock change        ...............	- 0-5	4- 0-8	-f- 2-2Electricity17. The use of electricity again increased in 1957; the estimated total was 77,000million units, A\ per cent higher than in 1956. The maximum demand in the winter of 1956/57 was 19,469 MW, a decrease of about 2 per cent compared with the estimatedmaximum potential demand in 1955/56. This decrease is also attributed to the mildweather in the early part of 1957. The maximum demand in 1956/57 was fully met,whereas in the winter of 1955/56 some load shedding was necessary. New plantbrought into operation in 1957 totalled 1,990 MW. The capital outlay by the indusrty was  255 million:  134 million for generating and ancillary plant,  32 million for maintransmission and  89 million for distribution.18. Work will soon begin on the Central Electricity Authority&apos;s third nuclear power station, at Hinkley Point in Somerset; the capacity of this station will be even greaterthan that of the Hunterston station (which is being built for the South of scotland electricity Board); so far it is the largest nuclear power station to be planned in theworld. Work has been going ahead on the Authority&apos;s other two nuclear stations;in addition, by the end of 1957, application had been made for the Ministers consent to the site for a further station and other sites were under investigation.Fuel efficiency19. With the passing of the Thermal Insulation (Industrial Buildings) Act, 1957, fuelefficiency has for the first time become the subject of special legislation. The Act, whichconcerns the insulation of industrial buildings, provides for Regulations to be made and to come into force not later than 1st January, 1959. The Investment allowance for fuel-saving industrial plant.and equipment was retained under the Finance Act,1957, and some additional devices were incorporated in the schedule of plant quali-fying for the allowance. Government loans to finance fuel-saving schemes have beenapproved up to  4f million, of which nearly  1 million was approved in 1957. Thedemand for advice from the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service continues to grow and it has set up a new Specific Advisory Service to deal with special problems arising in factories.
IRON AND STEEL20. Over one million tons more steel were produced in 1957 than in 1956; the mainresult was that only half as much steel was imported; in addition there were small increases in stocks and in home consumption and an increase of nearly 20 per cent in exports.3 21. The shift of emphasis from the production of durable consumer goods to theproduction of investment goods, which began in 1956, continued during the early months of 1957; as a result deliveries of sheet steel to the motor, cycle and aircraftgroup of industries in these months were lower than a year earlier, but from Mayonwards (following the sharp increase in activity in the motor trade) home deliverieswere much larger than in 1956. Imports of sheet s:eel in 1957 were lower than in 1956and there was a sharp fall in imports of plate and heavy sections. The output oftinplate was 20 per cent greater in 1957 than in 1956 mainly because of the new plantin South Wales; and exports of tinplate were up by about 40 per cent. There was,however, a shortage of orders for the home trade in the Autumn. Several handtinplate mills were closed during the year together with some old type steelmaking plantengaged in supplying steel to these mills. Because of the improvement in supplies from united Kingdom mills, the suspension of import duties on tinplate and terneplatelapsed in March, 1957, and on light sections and bars and certain types ofhoop and strip in September, 1957. The suspension of duty on sheets, other thancold reduced sheet of less than  90 a ton in value, is expected to lapse in March, 1958.22. The output of both home ironstone and of pig iron was also higher in 1957 thanin 1956. Although there was a decrease in the average number of furnaces in blastfrom 100 to 98, some blast furnaces capacity in the Midlands has not been fully employed because of a falling off in the demand for foundry pig iron. Imports of scrap and pig iron were both much lower in 1957 than in 1956. In 1957, new coke ovens went into operation in Scotland, the North West Coast, North East Coast,Lancashire, Sheffield and South Wales, and one blast furnace was completed inScotland, and two on the North East Coast. Ten new melting furnaces were completed in Scotland, Lancashire, Flintshire, Sheffield and South Wales, and new mills were completed on the North East Coast, in Sheffield and the Midlands. A number ofother schemes to modernise primary and finishing capacity were also completed.Table 21Steel Supplies and Materials ConsumedMillion tons	1955	1956	1957 (provisional)Materials Production of pig iron and blast furnace ferro-alloys   ...............      ...

ENGINEERING AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES&apos;23. in 1957 the output of the engineering and allied industries recovered from itsset-back in 1956 but did not reach the high level of 1955. Both the 1956 decreaseand the 1957 recovery were mainly, a result of fluctuations in the production of vehicles and consumer goods. Production of machinery and plant increased in 1957.but less rapidly than in the previous two years. There was a slight increase in thdMBPvolume of exports of the products of these industries. The steel shortage which was&quot;&quot;&quot;hampering production at the end of 1956 largely disappeared during 1957.24. The estimates of the supply and utilisation of products of these industriesgiven in Table 22 show that in 1957 compared with 1956 supplies rose by  110 million(measured at 1956 prices). Imports rose by  10 million continuing their trend since1954. Utilisation for home investment increased by  130 million. Utilisation for defence continued to fall. Table 23 gives details of production and exports of anumber of metal products. Comparing 1957 with 1956, deliveries of plant and machinery increased by about 4 per cent; machine tools contributed to this by increasing 16 per cent in value, perhaps 8 per cent in volume. After the first quarterthere was a sharp increase in the output of passenger cars and production continued at this higher level up to the end of the year; there were also recoveries in the volumeof production of commercial road vehicles and of tractors.Table 22Distribution of Supplies of Engineering and Allied Products^)  million 1956 factory prices		1955	1956	1957Supplies Production         ...........

The new merchant ships completed in United Kingdom shipyards during 1957amounted to 1 -44 million gross tons which was slightly more than in 1956 despite the national strike of shipyard workers in March/April and other labour disputes.The total launched was 1 -35 million gross tons which was just equal to that for 1956.The proportion of completions for overseas owners in 1957 was 36 per cent comparedwith 57 per cent in 1956. It is hoped that with the yard modernisation and reorganisation -sation which is now taking place, and with improved supplies of steel, shipbuildersmay be able to increase their annual output lo 1 -75 million gross tons, or even moredepending on whether additional labour can be recruited.26. New orders received by United Kingdom shipbuilding firms during 1957amounted to 1-823 million gross tons as compared with 2-28 million gross tons in1956. However 34 per cent of the total gross tonnage ordered was for overseasowners as compared with 31 per cent in 1956. The total order book rose from about 6-25 million gross tons at the end of 1956 to 6-87 million gross tons at theeud of September, 1957 (the highest figure reached since 1952) but it dropped to6-6 million gross tons by the end of 1957. However that total still represents overfour years&apos; work at the current rate of output. Although there have been only afew cancellations of orders so far, the continuing depression of the freight marketgives cause for anxiety. The first effects are likely to be seen in the cancellation ofships ordered in the United States. The laying-up of ships is having some effect onrepair yards.Aircraft27. The rate of expansion in the aircraft industry, which had been fairly rapidsince 1952, slowed down in 1957. The value of total output was about 8 per cent higher than in 1956 but some of this increase was the result of higher prices. defence work, deliveries to United Kingdom airlines and exports were all higher in value than in 1956. In defence work, a fall in the value of complete deliveries was morethan offset by a rise in the value of research and development work. Aviation exports in 1957 were 10 per cent greater than the previous record year, 1956. Engines and aircraft parts now constitute an increasing proportion of total exports an indication of the growing stock of British aircraft operating overseas, with its consequent main-tenance requirements.28. At the end of 1957 employment in the aircraft industry was just under 3 per centbelow the peak of 265,000 reached in January. The Defence White Paper, &quot; outline of Future Policy &quot;, issued in April, 1957, makes it clear that orders for the design,
BUILDING34. As a result of the Government^ policy of restraining home demand, the amountof building work put in hand began to drop in 1956; and in 1957, for the first time since the cuts in investment in 1950/51, the output of the industry ceased to rise;however owing to increased costs the value of work done was slightly higher than in1956. Employment in 1956 was exceptionally high but most of the extra menrecruited during that year seem to have left the industry by early 1957; for the year as a whole the number of men employed was aboui the same as in 1955 and 24,000lower than at the end of 1956. Output per man changed little; the stability of output was mainly a result of the unusually good building weather in the first quarter of 1957.35. The general housing subsidy was withdrawn at the end of 1956 and in 1957local authorities concentrated more on the replacement of unfit houses. public authorities started some 150,000 houses, and completed 175,000 houses, which wasabout the same number as in 1956.   The total value of housing work done for localdevelopment and production of military aircraft for the Forces will decline sub-stantially over the next few years. The future level of output and employment inthis industry will therefore depend upon civil and export orders and some contractionmay take place. The high level of export orders held at the end of 1957 should enable the 1957 rate of exports to be maintained throughout 1958. Total ordersoutstanding at the end of 1957 were lower than a year earlier.Radio and Other Electronic Apparatus \ /29. Output in the electronics industry was considerably higher in 1957 than in1956, and it reached the peak output of 1955. Output for defence in 1957 was slightly lower than in 1956; home deliveries for investment were about the same and exports were slightly higher. There was a large increase in production of domesticradio and television sets for the home market; sales of television sets slightly exceeded the 1955 record but sales of radio sets were not quite as high as in some earlier years.Employment in electronics rose steadily during 1957; the average for the year wasmidway between the 1955 peak and the lowest 1956 figure.Employment, Exports and Prices30. Employment in the engineering and allied industries as a whole was falling inthe first quarter of 1957, but this trend was reversed in the second half of the year.Over the whole year, employment increased by about 46,000. Although the numbers employed in the motor and cycle industries rose by 32,000 the industry still employedsome 17,000 fewer than at the end of 1955 when production was at about the same level. There was little change in employment in mechanical engineering and a 3 percent increase in electrical engineering (including radio and other electronic apparatus).There was a fail in the amount of overtime worked in these industries and an increasein the vehicle industry.31. The volume of exports of products of the engineering and allied industries in 1957 was 2 per cent greater than in 1956. The unusually large contribution shipbuilding in 1956 was not repeated in 1957; if ships are excluded the increase was about 3 per cent. The number of cars exported was 27 per cent above 1956and 9 per cent above 1955, the previous highest year; an increasing proportion ofexported cars went to the United Slates. Exports of motor and pedal cycles wereone-fifth less than in 1956. There was little change in the volume of exports of otherconsumer goods and capital goods.32. At the end of 1957, order books for capital goods remained long and produc-tion was still increasing. Orders on hand for machine tools fell throughout the year,but most types of heavy machine tools were still on long delivery. Although theindustry as a whole was still very busy, there were indications that production couldbe further expanded to meet an increased demand, should it arise.33. Between December, 1956, and December, 1957, there was little net change inthe average price of materials used in the engineering industry; wage rates rose byabout 6* per cent; prices of the industries&apos; products are estimated to have risen by5 per cent.
authorities in 1957 was about 5 per cent below the value in the previous year. By1957 the Building Societies had increased their interest rates and were in a positionto make more advances on private houses. Some 126,000 houses were started and completed for private owners and the value of work done was equal to the level ofthe previous year.36. New orders for industrial buildings had begun to fall early in 1956 but the,)75 million of work carried out in 1957 was little below the actual level of the previouskfear, a result no doubt of the large amount of work in hand. In the rest of theprivate sector the demand for new offices, shops, etc., remained at a high level andthere was some increase in the volume of work carried out. The total programme for public authorities continued to rise. In particular there was an increase in building for the fuel and power industries, the amount of road work carried out was nearly double that of 1956 and there were increases in the amount of school and hospital building. A large number of new orders were placed by public authorities duringthe year.37. Supplies of building materials were easier although some shortages of steeldeveloped. Deliveries of both cement and bricks to the home market were lower than in 1956.38. Building costs at the end of 1957 were nearly 4 per cent higher than at thebeginning of the year. The price of building materials increased by 2 per cent butthis included rises of 5 per cent or more for many materials, offset by falls in theprice of items made from non-ferrous metals; there were also increases in wage rates.39. The outlook for 195S is of lower output in the private sector and of localauthority housing. Output by the rest of the public sector should remain high butthere will be greater emphasis on large projects at the expense of small ones.TEXTILES AND CLOTHING40. The production of clothing in 1957 was about the same as in 1956 when it was higher than in any other post-war year. The labour force employed in the clothingindustry declined by 15,000. The output of the textiles industries (including knittedgoods but excluding made-up clothing) was a little higher in 1957 than in 1956 althoughthe numbers employed fell by 24,000. The volume of wool textile exports was maintained in 1956 but exports of cloth made from cotton and man-made fibres fellagain although less than in previous years.Cotton and Man-made Fibres41. The downward trend in production of cotton yarns and cloth ceased in 1957;output was slightly higher than in 1956, although lower than in 1955. Order bookswere kept up in the first half of the year by the restoration of confidence in UnitedStates raw cotton prices in 1956, the Suez crisis, and expectation of increases in millworkers&apos; wages, but the normal rise in demand in the autumn was smaller than usualand the increase in Bank-rate in September discouraged stock-holding. Moreover,the trade in finer cotton goods was handicapped for most of the year by uncertaintyover Sudan cotton prices. Output of spun yarns of man-made fibres and mixtureswas about the same as in 1956, but cloth production was the smallest since 1952;the decrease more than offset a slight rise in the production of cotton cloth. total output of man-made staple fibre and continuous filament yarn was higher than in1956. The seasonal increase in the later months of the year was however less markedthan usual.42. Once again there was a fall in exports of cotton cloth though it was smaller in1957 than in previous years; the biggest decrease was in exports to Australia. Therewas also a further fall in exports of man-made fibre fabrics, but there was a modestincrease in exports of cotton yarns and a larger increase in exports of man-madefibre yarns.Wool43. The wool industry was very active in the first half of 1957 but had a moredifficult time during the last three or four months of the year.   Total production for
1957 was slightly higher than in 1956. The number of people employed in the indusrty was steady in the first half of the year but towards the end there was short-time working in some sections although in others unfilled vacancies were reported. Thefalling price of wool and the world-wide decrease in demand has led to uncertainty about the industry&apos;^ immediate prospects. As Table 24 shows, exports from the wool industry in 1957 equalled the record high level of 1956 despite difficulties duringthe latter part of the year. ^Table 24Textile Production and ExportsMillion	i954	1955	1956	1957Production				Man-made fibres:				Staple fibre (lbs.)      ......	228	239	256	263Continuous filament yarn (lbs.)	220	233	227	233Single   yam   spun   in   cotton				industry:				Cotton and cotton waste yarn				(lbs.)............	841	747	702	727Spun rayon and mixture yarns	155	132	147	149Woven cotton cloth (linear yards)	1,994	1,781	1,612	1,628Woven man-made fibres and mix-				ture cloth (linear yards)	781	698	702	659Wool and hair tops (lbs.)	304	309	321	325Woollen and worsted yarn (lbs.)	539	539	530	538Woven wool  cloth,  excluding				blankets (square yards)	414	410	397	394Exports				Man-made fibres:				Staple fibre (lbs.)      ......	24	55	29	21Continuous filament yarn (lbs.)	28	27	32	39Cotton yarn and thread (lbs.) ...	52	47	47	48Spun rayon and mixture yarns				(lbs.)    ............	4	4	4	5Woven cotton cloth (linear yards)	631	534	460	445Woven man-made   fibres   and				mixture cloth (square yards)...	175	134	121	111Wool and hair tops (lbs.)	67	77	82	83Woollen and worsted yarn (lbs.)	25	26	29	30Woven wool piece goods, exclud-				ing   blankets   and   carpets				(square yards).........	98	108	110	109AGRICULTURE44. In 1957/58, both the acreage and the yield of most farm crops was affected bythe unfavourable weather but livestock production has continued to increase. As aresult, gross output is expected slightly to exceed the record levels reached in 1956/57and net output is expected to be about 63 per cent above pre-war.(&apos;)45. The tillage area continued to decline, but because of an increase in temporarygrass the total arable acreage was nearly maintained. There was a reduction in the acreage of cereals and fodder crops and yields of most crops were also low. Higherlivestock output and the poor harvest increased the demand for imported feedingstuffs,(&apos;) Net agricultural output is the value of agricultural products sold off the national farm,together with farmhouse consumption, less the cost of purchased feedingstuffs (exceptinter-farm sales) imported seeds and imported store animals. The index of net output is a constant price index using 1945/46 price weights.
but economy in their use is expected to limit the increase. Both acreage and yieldsof potatoes were lower in 1957/58 than in 1956/57 and some imports have become necessary. The acreage of vegetables and the production of several kinds of fruit and vegetables were also adversely affected but total production is expected to beabout average.46. As to livestock, in 1957/58 there has been a further increase in the breeding of beef cattle and the rearing of calves; it is estimated that the output of beef has been maintained at the high level of 1956/57, partly through the continuation of temporaryfactors such as the larger imports of Eire store cattle for fattening. Milk production has expanded further and again the extra supplies were used in manufacturing dairy products. The 1957 lambing season was a record one; many of the extra lambs arebeing retained to increase the breeding flock. There was also a sharp increase inthe pig breeding herd and a further rise in egg output.47. On 1st September, 1957, the Agriculture Act, 1957, passed into law. Thisgave statutory effect to the measures described in the last Economic Survey. farmers and landowners have been eager to improve the efficiency of the permanent equipment of their farms by availing themselves of the 33^ per cent Government grants andmany thousands of applications were received in the early months of the scheme.The Pig Industry Development Authority was constituted under the new Act inOctober, 1957. In November, 1957, Ministers announced that the disciplinaryprovisions of the Agriculture Act, 1947, which were designed to prevent bad husbandry,would be repealed as they had outlived their usefulness. At the same time, a changeof emphasis will be made in the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948, in order to make it easier for landowners to deal with unsatisfactory tenants and for the efficient to findfarms. A clearer formula for the arbitration of agricultural rents will also beincluded. Producers voted in favour of the Egg Marketing Scheme, and on 30th June,1957, the Board took over the marketing of eggs and administration of the priceguarantee. This had been the last direct trading responsibility of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food.Table 25Agricultural Production in the United KingdomYears beginning 1st June	1954-55	1955-56	1956-57	1957-58				(forecast)Crop Acreages (thousands)				Wheat and rye   .........	2,501	1,967	2,319	2,140Other grains      .........	5,253	5,340	5,305	5,305Potatoes............	945	874	921	812Sugar beet        .........	437	424	426	430All tillage         .........	11,832	11,301	11,485	11,176Crop Production (thousand tons)				Wheat and rye   .........	2,822	2,618	2,870	2,704Other grains      .........	5,239	6,155	5,693	5,423Potatoes............	7,325	6,278	7,533	5,705Sugar beet        .........	4,521	4,556	5,169	4,517Livestock Production				Milk (million gallons)   ......	2,138	2,206	2,359	2,395Eggs (&apos;) (thousand tons)	552	575	628	662Beef and veal    .........	797	687	849	855Mutton and lamb        ......	182	191	197	212Pigmeat (&apos;)       .........	757	659	641	708Net agricultural output (&apos;)				Total            (1936-39 = 100)	152	156	161	163Agricultural holdings only (J)				(1936-39 = 100)	151	155	160	161(&apos;) Includes estimated production from units of under one acre, e.g. gardens, pig clubs, etc.(2) In Great Britain, holdings of over one acre; in Northern Ireland, one acre and over.59(30824)   Wt. 1669-1485   150, 151, 80   3/58   d.l.
