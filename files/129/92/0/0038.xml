(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(5S) 88 COPY NO29th April, 1958CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign AffairsThe Geneva Conference came to an end in the small hours of28th April.   What remains to be done is the preparation of conventions and other documents for signature on Wednesday.2.        Although the Conference failed on the question of territorial sea, in some parts of its work it was successful.3.        It agreed upon Articles regarding fisheries and conservation ofthe natural resources which are acceptable to the United Kingdom andwhich are being incorporated in a Convention.   Another Convention will deal with the Continental Shelf on lines satisfactory to us.   There willalso be a Convention incorporating agreed Articles on the regime of thehigh seas.   These three Conventions will be signed on behalf of theUnited Kingdom.4.        The most difficult question was that of territorial waters withthe associated proposal for exclusive fishing zones.   The United kingdom delegation have succeeded in preventing the adoption by a two-thirds majority of a twelve-mile limit or (as at one time seemed possible) atwelve-mile exclusive fishing -zone.   The various proposals dealt within the final voting of 25th April are set out in the Annex.   As no proposalobtained a conclusive majority no State would be justified in basing its future action on any proposal before the Conference.5.        Apart from the breadth of the territorial sea, the Conference tookdecisions about the use of straight baselines and about closing linesacross the mouth of bays which are disappointing to us.   The Article aboutprior notification of the passage of warships through territorial watershas been dropped.   The Articles about territorial waters (other than the breadth of them) will also be included in a Convention, which will be signedfor the United Kingdom.6.        The United Kingdom Delegation stated on several occasions thatin the event of a failure to reach a decision or in the event of the adoptionof a twelve-mileproposal which we could not accept, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be in the position that the only rule of the law wasthe three-mile rule.-1-
7.         The joint declaration to the foregoing effect which the delegation were authorised to propose will not now be made, on account of american opposition;   but at the final meeting on 26th-27th AprilSir Gerald Fitxmaurice, the Foreign Office legal adviser, re-stated ourposition, namely that we would regard the three-mile rule as being ineffect, and added that if there was another conference in the future todiscuss this matter the United Kingdom would enter it on that basis andno other.8.        At the final session the Cuban Delegation introduced a resolution calling for another conference to settle the question.   This was taken up and amplified by Ghana and Ceylon, then by Australia and Canada, whopressed that until the next conference is held there should be no unilateralclaims.    In the end    the Cuban resolution was adopted with amendments.The resolution invites the United Nations General Assembly to call a newconference to consider questions unsettled at Geneva, and recommends that the States participating in the Geneva Conference should in the intervalmake possible the solution of these problems by means of multilateralor bilateral conventions, and should in the interval endeavour to create afavourable atmosphere for the re-convening of the conference.9.        This resolution was adopted by forty-eight votes to two, withtwenty-six abstentions.   Among the abstainers was Iceland.   The Icelandicdelegate explained his vote by saying that he could not commit hisGovernment to accepting a further waiting period until the next conference;Iceland had already had to v/ait a very long time.A.N.Foreign Office, S.W.1.28th April, 1958-2-
