(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C.(5S? C5 COPY NO, ^   )23rd April,. 1958CABINETPOLIO M YE P. IT IS VAC CINATIONMemorandum by the Lcrd President of the council I think we should all sympathise with the difficulties of theMinister of Health as the result of the extraordinary combination ofevents which have brought about the present breakdown of his carefully considered arrangements.2.      I feel, however, that, before my colleagues decide whether to accede to his advice which involves the categorical rejection of the unanimous advice on a technical matter of the Medical Research Council(M.R.C.) specifically consulted only a few days ago, they should realise the seriousness of the medical and political risks involved in their so doing and the narrowness of the advantages to be obtained thereby.3.      I understand from the Ministers paper (C.(5S) 84) that he proposes to deal with the shortfall of vaccine for 2^; million persons out-standing on 30th June by importing 4,000 litres of Saik vaccine (already authorised by the Home Affairs Committee) and abridging the tests nowprescribed by the abolitiin of the tissue culture test for living virus inthe vaccine.4.      In order to understand the extent to which this suggestion goescontrary to that of the M.R.C. it is necessary to make one point clear.The point remitted for their consideration was, as appears from paragraph 11 of C0(58j 84-, whether as a temporary measure the M0R,C,testing should be omitted altogether.   This was unanimously rejected bythe Council.   The M.R.C. examined the possibility that the tests mightbe abridged not (as I understand the Minister now to propose inparagraph 15(a) of his paper)   by the abolition of the live tissue culturetest altogether, but by including this test but limiting the period of growthto six weeks.   This suggestion was equally rejected by the Council,broadly for the reasons given in paragraph 11 of their minute;   but theproposal in paragraph 15(a) of C.(58) 84, which involves a greater element of riskj, was not even thought to require consideration.5.      As I understand it the evidence, although incomplete and not wholly satisfactory, strongly suggested to the Council that there is looseamong the supplies of Salk vaccine on sale by the American suppliersa certain amount of live polio virus, which is actively infecting a numberof American children with induced poliomyelitis at present.   With a totalnumber of 4 million injections with imported vaccine under consideration a number of cases might well occur here.   Whilst I can well understand-1-
(especially under conditions such as prevailed in America where theinc incidence of uaturaicases was high) that a medical practitioner mightchoose to run the risk of injecting an individual patient with vaccine that had not been through the M.R.C. tests, altogether different considerationsmight actuate a Government authorising, as now proposed, 4 millioninjections, and doing that after rejecting the advice of their medicaladvisers.6.      The actual practical advantages of the abridged test inparagraph 15(a) of C,(58) 84 appear limited.   For the Minister of Healthsays that abridging the test as he proposes will reduce the period ofdeficit from three months (30th June-30th September) to six weeks(30fch June-15th August) though I am not clear how this saving of six weeks fellows from the figures in paragraph 9 of his paper.   But, as willbe seen from paragraph 6 of the M.R.C0 minute the period of deficitcould be reduced to the period 30th June to 31st August without abridge-ment of the test by better programming and a purchasing policy which made use of larger batches, if authority were given to purchase5,000 litres instead of the 4,000 litres already authorised and that this could be done without fear of waste (paragraph 14).   What the Ministerof Health gains by abridging the test is thus about a fortnight&apos;s time inthe elimination of the deficit but the effect of abolishing the live tissueculture test would, I am advised, be disproportionately to reduce the chances of discovering relatively light contamination with live virus.It is for consideration whether the increased risk and the addedresponsibility incurred by disregarding medical opinion (which is alreadycritical of our record) is really worth this fortnight&apos;s time even if addedto the debit is the cost of another thousand litres of vaccine, which will beused in twelve months anyhow.7.      In addition to the practical considerations, there is also a constitutional point which I am advised may have an important bearing onthe whole future relationship (hitherto of incalculable value) between theGovernment and the Medical Research Council.   The M0R.C0 is notmerely a consultative body, but also the executive agent responsible forthe supervision of the abridged tests which the Minister of Health proposesshould be carried out.   Hitherto the M.R.C. has prescribed its own testsas a purely scientific body, detached from political considerations, whoserequirements have been prescribed solely by their own professionaljudgment.   Th-2 policy recommended by the Minister of Health could in thelast resort be implemented only by a direction to the M.R.C, (presumablyby myself on behalf of the appropriate Committee of the Privy Council) to supervise and execute tests which they could not conscientiously endorse.I cannot say what the consequences of such a direction on the future of theCouncil, or of its relationship with Government, would be, but they would obviously be serious and far reaching.8.      Even if the above represents an unduly tragic view of theconstitutional position, I would draw my colleagues&apos; attention to thesituation that we shall be putting ourselves in if we adopt the suggestion in paragraph 15(a) of C.(58) 84.   We shall be prescribing, not policy, butactual technical and scientific procedures to be followed in a highly specialised field when we have received the unanimous advice of the most-2-
expert opinion in this country that our proposed procedures arescientifically unacceptable.   From this point of view the alternative inparagraph 15(b) of the Minister&apos;s paper, although equally in disregard of professional opinion and more risky medically, would be less objectionable,since, to adopt the Minister&apos;s own phrase, it could fairly be described -as an administrative and political decision.9.      My own, rather reluctant, but somewhat definite conclusions are that we should give the Minister authority to purchase 5,000 instead of4,000 litres as suggested by the MJR.C. , and in the larger batches thereinenvisaged, and accept the advice of the M.R.C. not to curtail the tests.If we do decide to curtail the tests there would be advantage in omittingthem altogether rather than entering the scientific field and imposing testsourselves without scientific backing, and so running the risk of a public controversy in which the Medical Research Council would be opposedto us.HAILSHAMOffice of the Lord President of the Council, S.W.1.23rd April, 1958-3-
