(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;EGYPT;  FINANCIAL negotiations memorandum by the Minister of State, Foreign office on 30th April, The Times published a letter from Lords Salisbury,Halifax, Killearn and others asking that Her Majesty&apos;s Government shouldcompensate the refugees from Egypt and meet their claims including those for business assets.     I understand that this letter was draftedsome time ago and withheld so as not to interfere with the Anglo-Egyptian financial talks in Rome;   it was decided to publish it now becauseof the apparent stagnation of the talks.     This may mark the beginningof a new campaign on behalf of the refugees, particularly the &quot;smallmen&quot;.     The Foreign Secretary has been asked to report in thisconnection on the present position of our negotiations with Egypt.2.      Though no apparent progress was made in these negotiations inMarch and most of April, it now looks as though we are about to reach a critical stage.    It will be recalled that in early March the egyptian delegation in Rome took back to Cairo United Kingdom proposals onthe lines authorised by the Cabinet (C.C.(58) 20th Conclusions,Minute 3).     Though the Egyptians have failed to comment since then,there have been a number of indications that Colonel Nasser was holding up further talks until a settlement had been reached with the suez Canal Company, in order to give him an idea of the total bill for compensation which he would have to meet.    The Suez Canal Company&apos;claim has now been satisfactorily settled in principle, and this shouldhave strengthened the hands of Colonel Nasser&apos;s moderate adviserswho favour an accommodation with the West and also his own hand in moscow.     We may well therefore soon be approached by the Egyptiansfor a resumption of the talks, though not before Colonel Nasser&apos; return from Moscow on 18th May.3.      From the foreign policy point of view there is a great deal to besaid for trying to follow up the Suez Canal Company agreement withan acceptable agreement on our property in Egypt and related matters as soon as it can be concluded.    Mr. Iliff (the British Vice-Presidentof the International Bank, who acted as an intermediary in thenegotiations between Egypt and the Suez Canal Company) has mentioned to the Egyptians the desire of the International Bank to see the Anglo-Egyptian financial differences settled.    He has derived the impression that the Egyptians are now prepared to reach a financial settlement with Her Majesty&apos;s Government, which might prove more favourable to us if it provided for a rapid liquidation of the problem.     Certainlyour prospects of securing a satisfactory agreement will not improve.C.(5S) 957th May, 1958CABINET
Economic pressure on Colonel Nasser (maintained chiefly by the UnitedKingdom and United States) has not been decisive.    Though his economic position is weak, he will probably be strengthened by further Prussianaid, which may be announced as the result of his present visit toRissia, and by the $28 millions blocked Egyptian Government dollarsreleased by the United States when the agreement with the Suez canal company was reached.     Moreover, our own property in Egypt isgradually deteriorating;  and British businesses are faced with the&apos;alternative of direct negotiations with the Egyptians on future trade orallowing their business to go to our competitors.     The French Govern-ment have already concluded three barter deals with the Egyptiansamounting to  7 millions each way in all, and an Egyptian trade missionis now visiting Western Germany and Belgium.     Moreover, theInternational Bank, Mr. Hammarskjold, the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations Organisation, and other Western concerns are consideringlong-term development plans in the Middle East, which will certainly involve the Suez Canal and other projects in Egypt and Syria.     Forthese reasons, and in order to make our Middle Eastern policy generallymore effective, it is important to clear up the financial differences andthus open the way to diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria (on a charge d&apos;Affaires basis at first).    Admittedly our friends in the otherMiddle Eastern countries may be somewhat discouraged by such astep on our part, but consultations which we have had with some ofthe Governments concerned during recent months have shown them to bein a reasonable frame of mind and it should not be too difficult to persuade them that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.4.      On the details of the agreement, the United Kingdom Delegationhave been working on the lines described in C. (58) 55.     There haverecently been indications in reports from British businessmen as wellas from Mr. IIiff that Colonel Nasser wants a formula which willenable him to say that account has been taken of the Egyptian war damage claim, and also to settle the issxie once and for all by a lump-sum settlement.    Indeed, the Egyptians have mentioned such apossibility to us on a number of occasions, but we have not hithertoresponded.     Such a settlement would solve the problem of compensation and has attractions for us as well as for the Egyptians.    While itwould doubtless be preferable to clinch an agreement on the lines theCabinet have already approved, we may well find on meeting the egyptians again that it is a lump sum or nothing.     Such a solution,which would mean that Ker Majesty&apos;s Government would be responsiblefor deciding the amounts to be paid to individual claimants, would obviously present serious difficulties.    But very many of the claimantsin the United Kingdom would welcome it, as it would enable us tomake at our discretion some sterling payment to all classes ofclaimant who have suffered loss or damage to their property.Whatever type of agreement we have we must accept - and under inter-national law could not refuse - the return of the large amount ofsequestrated property which is still intact.     It therefore seemsimportant that we should be prepared to consider a lump-sum settlement as an alternative, should it be put forward by the Egyptians as aserious proposition.    It remains to be seen whether such a settlement could embrace some arrangement acceptable to us and which would satisfy the Egyptians on war damage.
5. For comparison, the declared (and clearly much inflated) valueof private property in Egypt is:-  millionsEgyptianised 46Sequestrated -Shell .          54Other businesses 20Private 53Total 173The present market value of the Egyptian blocked balances is about 76 millions.     Under the draft agreement handed to the Egyptians inMarch we were to receive  25 millions for Egyptianised property and 10 millions for compensation in Egyptian pounds for damage tosequestrated property.6.      Within the next few weeks pressure is likely to increase in and outside Parliament that more should be done for the refugees, not somuch by way of further interim relief as by final settlement of their claims, i. e. from the Egyptian sterling balances.    But, quite apart fromthe general objections to seizing the sterling balances, in thecircumstances described above it would seem a grave tactical mistake to launch any new measures in the United Kingdom at present, therebyimplying that we had given up hope of a negotiated settlement.7.      In conclusion, the Cabinet may be interested in some accountof the latest United States policy towards Egypt, in view of recentexaggerated Press reports that there has been a major softening towardsColonel Nasser.     Mr. Dulles, the United States Secretary of State,has just reaffirmed to us his continuing support for the general policyagreed between us to contain Colonel Nasser in the Middle East.     Butat the same time he has accepted the recommendation of the state department that, if Colonel Nasser stays contained, small relaxationsin economic policy might be tried out in order to halt his drift towardsRussia.     There is also much commercial and financial pressure inthe United States for relaxations.     Several minor relaxations havebeen announced (e.g. slightly more liberal grants of export licences,further injections of dollars into the Egyptian-American RuralImprovement Scheme) but the State Department contemplate that further steps (e.g.  shipments of surplus wheat and eventually other forms of limited economic aid) may follow, provided that the first batch ofrelaxations brings a satisfactory Egyptian response.     While agreeingwith these initial steps, which we can hardly prevent, we have urged thataid available from the West should be given primarily to our friends inthe Middle East.    The State Department appear to accept this and haveagreed to consult us about any future steps.     The Foreign Secretary isexpected to discuss this question with Mr, Dulles in Copenhagen.A.N.
