SECRET g4IkIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S government.(58) 537th March, 1958COPY NO.CAE INETERRITORIAL.- waters memorandum by the Attorney-general on Sunday, 2nd March, I discussed with the Americans atGeneva the possible compromise of a six-miles territorial sea limit witha right of passage for warships without prior authorisation and for air-craft outside three miles.    They are strongly opposed to this and haveno instructions to agree to any extension of the three-mile limit.2.         Since  Sunday I have become slightly more optimistic about our chances either of securing recognition of the three-mile limit or at least of avoiding recognition of any wider limit or of a right for a State to fixits own limit.    I snoke Wednesday and made the strongest case I couldfor the retention of the three-mile limit.     Comments made to membersof our delegation after my speech and remarks made to me lead me to hope that my speech had some effect.The general debate will last at least all next week and we shouldbe able to form some estimate of the support available for the retentionof the three-mile limit.    At the present time no reliable estimate canbe formed;   all that I can say is that there are indications of moresupport being won for the retention of three miles.3. I have seen the personal message to the Prime Minister from president Eisenhower urging us not to put forward our six-mile proposal.The Americans regard it as &quot;seriously in derogation of free worldinterests&quot; and as likely to result in acceptance by the Conference of atwelve-mile territorial limit.     The President also says that &quot;both governments are agreed that some concession is necessary&quot;.4.        The Americans agreed with me that we should both do battle forthree miles by itself.    In this general debate I am sure it would be most unwise if any suggestion of a compromise was made.     I did not give anyhint of one in my speech, and I hope that the Presidents message doesnot mean any abandonment of our agreement and that the Americans inthis general debate will suggest a compromise.     If any compromise hasto be suggested, such a suggestion should come much later and. if madelater is, I think, more likely to be accepted.     If any compromise issuggested now there will be considerable pressure to compromise toa greater extent.5.        In the general debate the Canadians are committed to putting forward their three-miles territorial sea and a further nine-milesexclusive fishing proposal.     I do not think that this will prejudice-1,
the position as that proposal was made by the Canadians long before this conference, but it would prejudice the position if at this stage the americans publicly supported it.6.        After this general debate in the Committee dealing withterritorial waters, a considerable time is likely to elapse before thereis any further discussion or vote on the breadth of these waters.Fishery questions are likely to be considered in another Committee first.There is consequently a sei-ious possibility that that Committee willrecommend twelve miles exclusive fishing and that that recommendationwill be made before the other Committee further considers the breadth of the territorial sea.     Ther^ may be consequently a very greatdifficulty in doing the kind of package   deal the Americans contemplate,7.        I think our policy should be to fight as long as there appearsto be any chance of success for recognition of the three-mile limit andto prevent recognition of any other limit or of the right for a State to choose its own limit.8.        If and when these efforts fail or look like failing - and I ammore optimistic of our chances than I was - then will come the time to try to effect a compromise.    It may be some weeks before this time comes.9.        There are only two possible compromises, our six-milesproposal and the American.     The Americans think our proposal will lead to the Conference accepting twelve miles.     There is, I think, an equal risk that their proposal would have that result.10.       I do not think that we should put forward our six-miles proposalunless it looks as if the American compromise will not succeed.     i feel that the six-miles proposal is the last hope to avoid the twelve-mile limit.11.        The difficult question is, should we support the American proposalif it is put forward.    I do not think that we need make a final decisionon that yet.    If the American compromise was accepted without oursupporting exclusive fishing rights, that would be to our advantage.It is only if our support seems likely to secure acceptance of their proposal that we should pay the price.    If, when it is put forward by the americans, it meets with a very hostile reception, we are not likely to gain anything by giving our support to exclusive fishing.12.       I had a talk with the Icelanders just before I left.     They likeso many others are very concerned about fishing conservation.    I feel it is worth while having discussions with them now to see if we can reach agreement with them.     Such discussions may fail, but I see no reason why the effort should not be made, for agreement with them may bemore difficult if the Conference accepts twelve miles.     If it does theyare certain to claim that limit.     Now they cannot know that that couldbe the result.     From what they said to me and in the present uncertainty as to the result of the Conference, I think there is a chance that such discussions would be fruitful.13.       I feel even more strongly than I did that, if we can formulatereally attractive conservation proposals, we shall take a lot of the steam-2-
out of the demand for exclusive fishing and that that in turn will reducepressure for an extension of territorial waters .14.       The object of the Conference is to agree on the law of thesea in peace.    It does not inevitably follow that twelve miles territorial waters in peace time means twelve miles in time of war and so a coversway for enemy submarines.15.       If our effort to maintain three miles by itself is not successful,and if the American compromise also fails, then if we do not putforward our six miles, I think the Conference is bound to go to twelvemiles.     It is because six is less disastrous than twelve that i recommend that we should be ready to put it forward as a last resort,and that v/e -should try to get the Americans to join us in doing so.R0E.M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department,W.C.1.7th March, 1958.-3-
