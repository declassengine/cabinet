confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1958C. (58) 91 Copy No.30th April, 1958CABINETDOWNING STREETMemorandum by the Prime Minister1 should like my colleagues to see the Report of the Committee which Iappointed in July, 1957, under the Chairmanship of Lord Crawford, to considerthe present condition of Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street, and the proposals fortheir reconstruction.2. The Committee think that the houses are in urgent need of a majorstructural overhaul and that the work should start as soon as alternative accommodation can be provided for the present occupants.3. Considerable sums of public money are involved. If the Committee&apos;srecommendations are accepted, the Government will have to face an expenditureof the order of  400,000 on the Downing Street houses and  750,000 on thereconstruction of the Treasury Buildings in Whitehall, which ought to be undertaken at the same time.,4. The provision of alternative temporary accommodation for the occupantsof 10-12 Downing Street will, I am advised, take some eighteen months to two years to prepare. The Downing Street houses cannot therefore be vacated before theend of the present Parliament.5. Before any programme of work is finally approved, I would propose to consult the Leader of the Opposition in the hope of obtaining his agreement.6. I would then propose to present the Report of the Crawford Committeeto Parliament as a Command Paper and at the same time to make a statement ofthe Governments intentions, viz., that the Committee&apos;s recommendations were accepted in principle and that instructions had been given for the detailed planning of the reconstruction and for the preparation of alternative accommodation to beput in hand at once.H. M.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,28th April, 1958.53372B
annex report OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE preservation of DOWNING STREETTo the Right Honourable Harold Macmillan, M.P.This Committee was appointed in July 1957. with the following terms ofreference:&quot; To consider the report of the Ministry of Works on the present conditionof Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street and the proposals for reconstruction; tomake such enquiries as appear to them necessary; and to report to the PrimeMinister what action they recommend should be taken to preserve these historicbuildings and to make them suitable for their present purposes.&quot;2. We have examined the Report referred to in our terms of reference andother reports prepared at our request, inspected the buildings, and taken evidence on various aspects of the problem. Throughout we have received from officials of the Prime Minister^ Office, the Treasury, the Government Whips&apos; Office and theMinistry of Works the fullest co-operation and help, for which we should like toexpress our appreciation and thanks.3.   We now have the honour to submit our report.Historical Background4. Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street are all that now remain of a square ofprivate houses built, as a speculation, during the latter part of the SeventeenthCentury by Sir George Downing on land leased to him by the Crown. They havebeen radically altered during the centuries since they were built. No. 10 consists oftwo houses joined together. The smaller Downing&apos;s No. 10 opens on toDowning Street. The larger, to the north, is the more important structurally andarchitecturally; it is probably a year or two older than the Downing Street houses and contains the Cabinet Room and the principal reception rooms. The two houses were joined and reconstructed between 1732 and 1735 after Sir RobertWalpole had accepted them from the Crown as a residence for the First Lord ofthe Treasury (or, should he decline its use, for the other Lords Commissioners inorder of precedence). No. 11 comprises Downing&apos;s Nos. 11 and 12; the two houses were finally joined together in 1846 and probably became the residence of theChancellor of the Exchequer shortly after, though the actual date when they were first occupied by a Chancellor is uncertain. All that remains of what is now knownas No. 12 is the basement and ground floor and even these have been much altered.The upper storeys of the house were removed after being gutted by fire in 1879.It became Crown property in 1803, since when it has been occupied by various government Departments.5. Internally all three houses have been patched and altered many times to adapt them to changing living conditions and to meet the tastes of successivegenerations. Also large parts have been turned into offices a purpose not foreseenwhen the houses were built. Most of the alterations and adaptations, including those necessary to provide the houses with gas, electricity and bathrooms have beencarried out by architects of the Board later the Office and now the Ministry of Works; but some of the major alterations to No. 10, and to a lesser extent toNo. 11, have been the work of such architects as Sir Robert Taylor andSir John Soane.6. We have taken evidence on the architectural importance of the houses as&apos;they now stand and have ourselves inspected the houses with this aspect in mind.While the houses are too much of a hybrid to be of outstanding architectural value as a whole, nevertheless the facades of Nos. 10 and 11 are survivals of a style whichwas common in London in the past and there is a strong case for preserving them on these grounds. Internally, there are certain rooms which ought to be preserved!n their entirety for historical or architectural reasons: these are, in No. 10, theCabinet Room and the two secretaries&apos; rooms to the east of it and the waiting-room
and secretary&apos;s room to the south of it, the range of State rooms on the first floorfacing Horse Guards Parade, and the Soane breakfast and dining rooms and, in&apos;No. 11, the Soane dining room and the drawing room. In addition the mainstaircases in both No. 10 and No. 11 and certain chimney pieces especially themarble ones in the drawing room of No. 11 and the rooms below it werecommends d to us as being of architectural merit. We were not told of anything in the &quot;stump&quot; of No. 12 which ought to be retained since all the features ofhistorical and architectural importance have already been lost, mainly as a resultof the fire of 1879.Present Uses7. Although No. 10 is best known as the official address of the Prime minister it in fact fulfils three purposes. As his private house it must be readily adaptableto the needs of successive occupants however large or small their families. Secondly,as his official residence it must contain accommodation for guests and also facilitiesfor large-scale entertaining. Thirdly, it is the office of the apex of centralGovernment and, in addition to the Cabinet Room, must provide offices for a staffof about 50 and, since the office is manned 24 hours a day and 7 days a week,sleeping quarters for a limited number of staff on night duty. The requirements ofNos. 11 and 12 are less exacting. No. 11, as the residence of the Chancellor of theExchequer, has, like No. 10, to be adaptable to the needs of families of varyingsize; but entertaining is not on so large a scale, and the house is not regularly used as an office though most Chancellors use the study for some of their work. No. 12is used solely as offices for the Government Whips.8. We have asked representatives of the Prime Minister, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Government Whips whether they find the houses satisfactoryfor their present purposes. No. 10, we were told, has many drawbacks particularlyin the basement and ground floor which are used mainly as offices, and where thelayout is confused, inconvenient and wasteful and the quality of many of the roomspoor; those used as sleeping quarters for night staff are particularly bad. Moreover,office space is insufficient. Already some of the staff of No. 10 have overflowedinto the Treasury, and if another Prime Minister wished for an increased staffwith, possibly, a number of special advisers, further encroachments would be unavoidable. This in turn means that Treasury staff have to be moved to other buildings further afield as there is no spare space in their present buildings. the domestic accommodation in No. 10 is reasonably suitable for most Prime ministers and their families though there are not enough bathrooms. The State rooms are quite adequate, but the cloakrooms are inadequate and inconveniently placed.9. On the other hand we were told that the occupants of Nos. 11 and 12 have found the accommodation satisfactory. In No. 11 the only serious drawback isthat there is no lift, though there are certain minor disadvantages, notably thefact that the ground floor is used as a passage between the offices in No. 10 andNo. 12. But in general it appears to be suitable for its purpose and about the rightsize for most occupants. The number of staff to be housed in No. 12 variesconsiderably between Governments as the size of the Government Whips&apos; officefluctuates. Nevertheless we were assured that the accommodation at present provided had in general proved satisfactory in both scale and layout, as well as having the essential merit of being close to the Prime Minister^ office.The Condition of the Houses10. We have examined the report by the Ministry of Works on the conditionof the houses; a summary is given in the Appendix. This report was drawn up in1954 after surveys had been made by the Ministry&apos;s experts in soil mechanics andin structural, sanitary and electrical and mechanical engineering. We are informed,however, that as the houses could be made available only for a very short period for this technical examination the Ministry do not regard the report ascomprehensive. In addition we have ourselves made a thorough tour of the houses,during which we were able to examine a trial hole and various inspection panelsin the walls and roofs which had been specially opened up.11. The trial holes have disclosed that the main walls are founded onsilt-subsoil, and that some of the foundations were built on timber cills which have long since rotted so that, the loading is now concentrated at certain points, leaving,in between, cavities over which portions of the walls are unsupported. As a result
of movements of the foundations many of the walls are out of plumb. Some ofthe floors are weak, notably in the Cabinet Room where the floor is largelysupported by strutting in the room below; this was originally put in to make an air-raid shelter, but could not be removed when other war-time protection work was dismantled lest the floor of the Cabinet Room collapse. The floors in theState reception rooms are also in poor condition and we are informed that, asa safety precaution, a limit has been set to the size of the parties held there. Allthe floors and staircases are built of wood, much of which is now old, dry anddecayed. In many places they are out of level. We were told that, also becauseof movements in the foundations and walls, doers and windows need very frequentadjustment, and that a carpenter is employed almost full time on this work. Theroofs are in bad condition the timber has become excessively dry and there isbeetle decay in some of the rafters.12. We have not ourselves made a detailed inspection of the services, but wehave studied reports on them from the Ministry of Works who tell us that most ofthem have reached a point where they can no longer be patched but ought to bemodernised and to a large extent renewed if they are not to break down completely.The sanitary system, which has been built up piecemeal over the years, needsconstant repairs; it is out of date, much of the pipework is sub-standard and thelayout of the pipe-runs is unsatisfactory. A good deal of the electrical and heatingservices also needs renewing, especially the domestic hot water system where manyof the pipes should be replaced. The lift in No. 10 gives constant trouble, but anew one could not be put in unless the brickwork in the lift well were first renewed.13. We enquired about the average cost of maintaining the houses. TheMinistry of works told us that, because they were built originally as a speculation,these houses were not as solidly constructed as, say, the average family mansionintended to last for generations, and that the need for frequent repairs is aggravated by the fact that the houses have been in constant use for nearly three hundred years. We were told that since the war the cost of repairs had averaged over 8,000 a year at present-day prices, even though during the last three yearsmaintenance has been kept to the absolute minimum in the hope that a thoroughstructural overhaul would soon be possible.Provision of Alternative Accommodation14. Since the houses are used to capacity it is impossible to carry out anythingbut minor repairs while they are occupied. We therefore enquired what arrangements could be made for the occupants while any major structural work was in progress. The Ministry of Works told us that they had prepared plans foradapting Admiralty House, together with 36 Whitehall and one wing of theAdmiralty main building, for use by the Prime Minister, his staff and theGovernment Whips&apos; Office. They emphasised, however, that as well as allowingtime for arrangements to be made for the First Lord of the Admiralty to move outof Admiralty House, a good deal of preparatory work would be needed before thePrime Minister could move into it. Altogether, therefore, about eighteen months&apos;notice of such a move would be needed. They could see no possibility of being able to make available at short notice any alternative accommodation on the rightscale and near enough to the Houses of Parliament.15. To provide any alternative accommodation which might be needed for theChancellor of the Exchequer and the First Lord of the Admiralty would be a lessdifficult problem since accommodation for them would be on a relatively small scale, and residential only.Conclusions on the Condition of the Houses16. We consider that the conditions revealed by the Ministry of Works report,and confirmed by our own inspection, are disturbing. We agree with the Ministrythat the foundations are unstable, that as a result of movements in them most ofthe walls are in an unsatisfactory state and need supporting if not rebuilding, andthat the staircases and many of the floors need strengthening. The roofs, too, arein bad condition and should be renewed.
17. In our view there are four major risks inherent in the present situation.First there is the safety risk. In view of the condition of the houses it is impossibleto rule out the possibility of a wall collapsing, though no one can say that this is certain to happen within a specified number of years. But in any event it is clearthat, unless the structure is strengthened, there is a grave risk of further movementof the walls within the next, say, twenty years, and if this happens extensiveemergency repairs will have to be carried out at once, regardless of whether it isconvenient for the occupants for work to be done at that time, and almost certainlywhen no alternative accommodation is immediately available. The second risk isfire. Because the houses are largely constructed of timber which has long sincedried out any fire would spread rapidly. This would be the more serious becausethe layout of the houses is such that swift evacuation would be difficult, and becauseefficient fire-fighting would be obstructed by the fact that fire engines cannot getclose to the building at the back. Thirdly there is the risk we might say the certainty that money will be wasted. As we have already pointed out, the costof keeping the houses merely habitable is, because of their age and condition, very high. Moreover, since it will not be possible to keep the services running much longer unless they are overhauled and to a large extent renewed, a good deal willhave to be spent on them whatever is decided about the structure; but unless anduntil the structure is strengthened all money spent on maintenance, whether of thefabric or the services, is being poured into a building which can at best have onlya short life before it is reconstructed, and thus such money is bound to be largelywasted. Finally, there is the risk of loss of features of historic interest orarchitectural merit: the longer the houses remain in their present unsatisfactorystructural condition the smaller are the chances that any such features can be preserved.18. We have therefore reached the conclusion that the Downing Street housesneed a thorough structural overhaul. We do not think that the Prime Minister andhis staff or the Chancellor of the Exchequer should continue to live, work andentertain in a building which is structurally unsound and where the risk of fireis substantial. In our view the first essential is to give the houses good foundations :every wall should be founded on the gravel subsoil which is known to exist a fewfeet below the present foundations. Only if this is done can there be any certainty that there will be no future differential settlement and that the work, which weconsider is badly needed, to give the houses sound walls and roofs will be effective and of lasting value. Further, we recommend that planning and other preliminary work should start at once and that physical work should start as soon as alternative arrangements can be made for housing the present occupants. We consider thatthis is a case where delay both involves unjustifiable risks and costs money and wecannot stress too firmly the need for early action.Proposals for Repair and Reconstruction19. There are several ways in which the work needed to put the houses intosound structural condition might be done.  These are.-&apos; (a\ Demolition of the houses and rebuilding to a new and modern design.(b) Demolition of the houses and complete rebuilding Nos. 10 and 11 totheir present external design and No. 12 to its original height andincorporating within the building such features of the present houses as are worth transferring or, where this is impossible, copying for historicaland architectural reasons;(c) Minimum repairs, limiting work to what is necessary to make the buildingstructurally sound and to put the services into good order, and makingno alterations to the layout;(d) A course intermediate between (b) and (c) comprising strengthening and where necessary reconstruction of the existing houses but including agood deal of internal replanning, though retaining intact the features of historical importance.20. A completely new building would have many advantages, notably thatthe layout and services could be specifically designed to suit the purposes for whichthe houses are used. The cost would, of course, depend upon the design of thebuilding so we are not able to give any estimate. However, we do not recommendthis course. The houses, and especially No. 10, have many historical associations and we should deplore their demolition   Moreover, in addition to the desire to53372
preserve something which has figured so prominently in public life over nearly three centuries and which has become such a familiar feature of the London scene,there is the fact that, even though they are a patchwork of the styles of many different periods, the houses do contain features of great architectural importance which we think ought to be preserved.21. The second method which we considered was demolition of the presenthouses and replacement by a building which externally would be an exact replica ofthe present Nos. 10 and 11 and of No. 12 before 1879. The interior would be entirely modern though such features of the present houses as are worth preservingfor historical or architectural reasons could be dismantled and reconstructed within it, if necessary in different positions, or, where reconstruction was impossible,replicas could be made and incorporated. This course would have many of theadvantages of complete rebuilding, and might well be cheaper than preserving theexisting fabric though it is not possible to give an estimate without a clearer ideaof what the building would be like. Nevertheless we do not recommend it. Wethink it would be a case of getting the worst of both worlds. The designer of thenew building would be hampered by having to work within a historical framework,and yet the result since it would be only a replica would have little historical orsentimental significance. Also we consider that, however skilfully the work was done, the features to be specially preserved would be in danger of damage and would lose their character even if they were dismantled room by room and re-erectedwith the greatest care in the new building.22. The Ministry of Works witnesses have assured us, and our technicalmembers confirm, that it would be feasible to repair and strengthen the buildings intheir present form in such a way that thev could be guaranteed safe for many years to come. The foundations could be underpinned, walls, floors and staircasesstrengthened, the roof rebuilt and services renewed, all without in any way altering the appearance or layout of the houses. This would be tantamount to preserving the houses as a museum-piece in which the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer, and their staff would be expected to live and work. We are informedthat, on the basis of what is already known about the condition of the houses,it might cost about  300,000 to do this; but it often happens that when buildingsas old as these are opened up for repair work to be started, the actual damage anddeterioration is found to be far worse than had been expected from a comparativelysuperficial examination, so we are not satisfied that the cost of minimum repairscould, in fact, be limited even to this sum. However we consider that, in view of thedrawbacks to the present accommodation, especially in the office floors of No. 10,and the fire risks, it would not be right to spend this amount of money on preserving the houses in precisely their present form. We do not think that this expenditure would be justified unless the result were to be a building which was economical,efficient and convenient for its various purposes, and this would certainly not beachieved if work was limited to minimum repairs.23. We are satisfied, however, that none of these extreme courses-involvingcomplete demolition or retention in precisely the present form is necessary.Provided that work is done before the condition of the structure has deterioratedfurther, the foundations could be underpinned or renewed and founded on thegravetl subsoil below, most of the walls could be supported though some might need replacement, the roofs could be renovated or renewed, and dried-out woodreplaced by fire-resisting material. We must emphasise that every wall would needinspection to ensure that it was stable; and since it would probably be more costlyto under-pin than to reconstruct de novo we suggest that where the whole of a wallis found to be weak it should be underpinned only if it intrinsically meritspreservation. The result of work on these lines would be substantially the present structure but in sound condition. Within it we would hope to see preserved, thoughstrengthened where necessary, those features (mentioned in paragraph 6) whichare of historical or architectural interest; but apart from these we think that theinterior of the houses should be replanned in such a way as to make the best possible use of the available space and so as to make reasonable fire precautionspossible. We would, however, suggest two main modifications to the exterior.First, the third floor over part of the eastern section of No. 10, a comparativelyrecent addition, is, we think, out of keeping with the rest&quot; of the house and we see no reason why it should not be removed or drastically altered. Secondly, we should like to see No. 12 rebuilt to its original height, both for appearance and for the extra accommodation it would provide.
24. To reconstruct the houses on these lines might cost, we are told, some 400,000, though until a design is approved, and until the houses have been completely opened up and the full truth about their condition is known, such anestimate can be only tentative. This is some  100,000 more than the &quot;spot&quot;estimate for minimum repairs, but in our view to spend the larger sum and obtain an improved layout and more accommodation would be a good investment whereas,as we have already said, we think it would be unjustifiable to spend  300,000 onpreserving the houses in exactly their present form. By reconstructing the housesthe nation would both retain their historical and architectural interest and providethe occupants with an up-to-date, well-planned and larger building. We therefore recommend this course.Appointment of an Architect25. We have deliberately refrained from turning ourselves into a buildingcommittee, and therefore we have not discussed details of layout or techniques ofbuilding or restoration. We have, however, examined plans for reconstructing thehouses, drawn up a few years ago by the Ministry of Works, but we are not convinced that they make the best use of the space available. We understand thatthey were subject to a number of limitations; and though these would apply whoeverdrew the plans for example the Chancellor^ residence must always be adjacent to the Prime Ministers, the Government Whips&apos; Office close to the Prime Ministersoffice, and the layout of the offices must conform with groupings of the work wethink that an independent architect would have a freer hand in designing a newlayout. Executive responsibility for carrying out the work, as well as financial control of expenditure on it, should rest with the Ministry of Works, but werecommend that the Minister of Works should appoint an independent architectexperienced in this kind of work who should be given as much freedom as possibleto initiate and draw up plans for reconstructing and replanning the houses inconsultation with the occupants and the Ministry of Works and within the principles which we have outlined.26. We also recommend that the designs for external alterations to the houses,including those for rebuilding No. 12, should be submitted to the Royal Fine art commission.The Treasury Buildings27. We are informed that plans have been drawn up for reconditioning andinternally reconstructing the Treasury buildings in Whitehall. Work on these buildings is overdue and will have to be done soon to repair bomb damage, tobring them up to present-day standards and so make them fit for continuedoccupation, and to obtain an efficient and economical layout. But as the Treasurybuildings adjoin 10 Downing Street disturbance to the occupants of No. 10 wouldbe intolerable while work on the Treasury was in progress. We consider therefore that the Treasury reconstruction should be carried out concurrently with workon the Downing Street houses.Summary of Recommendations28.   We have therefore made the following recommendations:  (a) Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street should be given a major structuraloverhaul. Planning and other preliminary work should start at once and physical work should start as soon as alternative accommodationcan be made ready for the present occupants.   (Paragraph 18.)(b) The   major  structural   overhaul   should   aim   at   strengthening   andreconstructing the existing houses and so far as possible retaining theirpresent external appearance, though part of the top storey of No. 10might be removed or altered and No. 12 should be rebuilt to its originalheight. Inside Nos. 10 and 11 rooms and features of historic orachitecturat importance should be preserved, but the remainder ofthe interior should be replanned.   (Paragraphs 23-24.)
D. M. HAKIM,Secretary,1st March, 1958.(c) The Minister of Works should appoint an independent architect to draw up plans for reconstruction and replanning, though executive andfinancial responsibility for carrying out the work should rest with theMinistry of Works.   (Paragraph 25.)(d) Designs for external alterations should be submitted to the Royal FineArt Commission.   (Paragraph 26.)(e) Reconstruction of the Treasury buildings in Whitehall should be carriedout  concurrently   with   work   on   the   Downing   Street  houses.(Paragraph 27.)29.   In conclusion we should like to express.our most grateful thanks to Our secretary, Miss D. M. Hakim.  She has carried out all her duties with completeefficiency and we much appreciate the help which she has given us.CRAWFORD.BRIDGES.CHANDOS,HOWARD ROBERTSON.ARTHUR WHITAKER.
appendix summary OF THE REPORT BY THE MINISTRY OF WORKS ONNos. 10, 11 AND 12 DOWNING STREETIn 1954 limited surveys were made and revealed the following facts:  Main Walls and FoundationsThe main walls generally are founded in silt subsoil overlying gravel at an approximate depth of between 5 ft.-15 ft. Trial holes showed that, at least in these places, the brick walls originally rested on timber cills now in an advanced stage ofdecay. The rear walls of No. 10 may be founded on gravel; that of No. 11 isfounded on a lime concrete footing. The greater part of the length of the frontwall foundation of Nos. 10 and 11 was strengthened in 1936, at about the sametime as the front annexe to No. 10 was built. The consolidation of the silt subsoilhas largely ceased but some continued movement of the walls is likely from the progressive compression of the rotted cills.The limited evidence obtained from the trial holes indicates that the soilconditions are not uniform and therefore there is the possibility of further differentialsettlement.The main walls are of brick in lime mortar with a regular bonding and straightjoints at some intersections. They are poor structually. The front and rear wallsof No. 11 are out of plumb and the flank wall dividing Nos. 11 and 12 shows diagonalfractures. There are no damp-proof courses.Roofs and FloorsMuch of the timber work in floors and roofs is inaccessible but the limitedexamination made confirms that much of the timber is old, dry and decayed, andthere is evidence of dry rot and beetle decay. Over the last 40-50 years repairshave been carried out to strengthen damaged sections of the floors and roofs.Some of the roof beams of No. 10 have been stiffened with steel framing; thisframing is supported on existing timber work which is itself now needing additionalsupport. The roof of No. 11 is in a worse condition than that of No. 10; the tiebeams of the roof trusses, which form the beams supporting the top floor, sagconsiderably. In general the pitched parts of the roofs are covered with tiles andthe flats with lead; they are in constant need of maintenance. Gutters are out oflevel and coping stones need renewal.Floors generally are now out of level and of low loading capacity, and thestrength of many has been reduced by earlier cutting away. The floor beams of theCabinet Room are strutted from below.Joinery and PlasterworkJoinery and plasterwork are faulty because of the continued movement of the structure, and windows and doors need constant adjustment to keep them freeopening.Sanitation and Water supply the sanitation and water supply were originally intended for a very limiteduse and have been constantly added to; the whole system is a complicated and make-shift arrangement.Engineering ServicesThese are all in unsatisfactory condition. The pipe runs are faulty and the wiringneeds renewal. When the Prime Minister is in residence a maintenance engineerhas to be kept constantly available to attend to the lift in case of breakdown. Anew lift was kept in store for several years but was not installed pending the maindecision on reconstruction because it could not be placed in the existing lift wellunless the brickwork of the well were first renewed.Fire RiskThis is abnormally high because the generalconstruction of floors and roofsis of timber which has now become very dry.
