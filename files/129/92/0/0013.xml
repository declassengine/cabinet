144AGRICULTURE ACTS, 1947 AND 1957ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees, 1958I. introduction. The 1958 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of theagricultural industry has now been held in accordance with Section 2 of the agriculture Act, 1947. In the light of it, and of the long-term assurancesprovided for in the Agriculture Act, 1957, the Government have determined the guarantees for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1958, to march, 1959, and for crops from the 1958 harvest. These are set out inAppendix V.II. Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production2. Agricultural net output has increased further. For the year 1957/58 it is forecast at 63 per cent above pre-war, as compared with a revised figure of61 per cent for 1956/57. This increase is largely the result of a further rise inthe production of livestock products.3. The main features of production at present are continued expansion inthe production of beef, mutton and lamb; a continuing upward trend in theoutput of milk and eggs; and a new and steep upward trend in the output ofpigmeat. The area of tillage crops declined in 1957, but this was offset by anincrease in temporary grass, so that the arable area was substantially maintained.Changes in Income4. There is an upward trend of net income. The forecast of actual net income for 1957/58 is  360 million, compared with a revised figure of  314million for 1956/57. When adjusted for normal weather conditions, net income is estimated at  361^ million for 1957/58; the comparable figure for 1956/57was  333^ million. Both on an actual and on a normal weather basis the forecast for net income is substantially higher than ever before.Efficiency5. Only a broad estimate of increasing efficiency can be made; but in theGovernments view this appears to be continuing at least on the scale at whichit has been assessed previously, that is something like  25 million a year for review commodities.Changes in Costs6. The price of some goods and services used in agricultural production,notably labour, have again risen. The prices of others have gone down,particularly feedingstuffs but also other items such as oil fuel the prices ofwhich were temporarily increased in 1956/57. The cost changes for reviewcommodities, after excluding feed costs for pigs and eggs which are reflectedautomatically in adjustments to the guarantees for those commodities, show anet increase of about  11 million. This net increase is the lowest that has hadto be taken into account at any annual review since that of 1954.III. Production and Guarantee PoliciesPolicy Objectives7. Production and guarantee policies have been reviewed in the light of increased supplies and falling market prices as well as of all other relevant330901 A 2
-    145domestic and international considerations. These have particularly included,this year, the strain on our gold and dollar reserves, the continuation up to thepresent of inflationary pressures, the substantial increase that has occurred inthe Exchequer burden arising from the price guarantees for agricultural produce,and the effects of increased home agricultural output on our overseas trade,particularly with the Commonwealth. The Governments production policyis set out in the immediately following paragraphs.8. The main objective continues to be that production should be more economic. This means striving for a steady improvement in the competitive position of the industry. This will depend on securing decisive reductions inunit cost, including the elimination of some of the highest cost production, bythe adoption of improved techniques and better farm management. Greateradaptation of what is being produced to the needs of the market is also important. The industry will not secure these results merely by a general increase in production; markets are already amply supplied and the reducedoutlets for further supplies have become more selective.9. The industry by its efforts has in the past made a substantial contributionto the balance of payments. But the recent expansion of gross output has been based largely on the production of milk, pigs and eggs, at a substantial cost inimported feed, and the value to the balance of payments of such output isdoubtful. In present circumstances gross output, particularly of these products,should not be expanded any further unless this can be done at substancially lower cost of production and without prejudicing the aim of relieving the tax-payer of the increasingly heavy burden of subsidy cost. But this developmentcan only come about gradually. On present prospects no further expansion in gross output is required. Any further expansion of net output should depend on economies in the use of resources and, in particular, the greater sub-stitution of home-grown for imported feed, including more and better useof grass and grass products. While there should be a reduction in theresources devoted to producing commodities in abundant supply, particularlymilk, pigs, eggs and wheat, there is room for further diversion of resources tothe production of beef and lamb and of feed crops.10. The general directions in which the maintenance or expansion of net output should be sought in present circumstances are: (i) the maintenance of a large arable acreage, of something like the currentsize, but with more emphasis on feed crops rather than wheat;(ii) greater reliance on home-produced feed for livestock;(iii) production of more beef and lamb of the quality wanted by themarket;(iv) production of less milk, pigmeat and eggs.These changes and developments should enable the industry to make a further contribution to the balance of payments.Exchequer Cost11. The difficulties of the fight against inflation require that everything possible should be done to keep down Government expenditure in agriculture,as in other sectors of the economy. The total cost of the support to agriculturehas risen substantially over the last two years from  206 million in 1955/56to  240 million in 1956/57 and to an estimated  290 million for 1957/58. It is fully recognised that a substantial part of the increase is due to the recent risingcost structure and to decreases in commodity prices generally. A major purposeof the guarantees is to protect agriculture from the full effects of changes whichare not within the control of agricultural producers.   Nevertheless, some part
of the additional cost arises from the effects of increases in home production on markets already amply supplied. It is essential to adjust the guarantees inthe light of production and market trends and of the burden&quot; on the taxpayer,while maintaining a proper level of support for the industry.IV. Long-Term Assurances12. The Agriculture Act, 1957, has provided new assurances to the industry that were welcomed by the farmers&apos; representatives as a sound and satisfactory basis for future confidence and the necessary forward planning in the industry.13. The Act requires the Government to make determinations after eachannual review such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees at not lessthan 97^ per cent of their total value in the preceding year, after allowing forcost changes that have occurred on review commodities since the last annual review. In addition the guaranteed price for each commodity must be main-tained at not less than 96 per cent of that determined after the preceding annual review.14. The total value of the guarantees (including relevant production grants)for this purpose at the 1958 Annual Review was calculated to be  1,278 million,and 97^ per cent of this is  1,246 million. After the addition of the relevantcost increase of about  11 million, the lower limit for the governments determination is a reduction of about  21 million in the total value of the guarantees.V. Governments Conclusions15. The national economic situation, the Exchequer liability, the commodityconsiderations and international relations, especially with the Commonwealth,all require a significant reduction in the level of the guarantees. There is nothing in the situation of the agricultural industry, whose recent productionrecord reflects its strength and resilience, which would go against that con-clusion. The net income of the industry has risen and now shows clearly the rising trend of which, as stated in the 1957 Annual Review White Paper(Cmnd. 109), there appeared to be signs a year ago. This is due to a combina-tion of factors that includes the increases in guaranteed prices and production grants since 1954, the continued increase in the efficiency and output of theindustry, and during the last year the decrease in feed costs. These havebetween them more than offset the increase in other costs that has occurred.Accordingly, in the Governments view the trends of net income, of net output and of costs and the effects of the continued increase in the efficiency of theindustry are such that the level of the guarantees can be reduced this yearconsistently with the maintenance of a proper level of remuneration for theindustry. It is also essential to reduce the guarantees if the desired guidanceis to be given to the production of the commodities concerned. At the sametime the long-term assurances set a very real limit to the reductions that canbe made both in the total and on the particular commodities. After takingfull account of all the relevant factors, including the position of the small farmer, the Government have decided that the total value of the guaranteesshould be reduced by about  19 million, to a figure  2 million above theminimum assured by the Agriculture Act, 1957.VI. Determination of Guarantees16. The determinations to be made were those for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1958, to March, 1959, and those for crops of the1958 harvest. The determinations for the particular commodities are set outin Appendix V.  The main features are as follows.530901 A 3
-    147Livestock Products17. Production of milk continues to increase and is now substantially abovecurrent requirements, with undesirable consequences at home and abroad,particularly within the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding the operation of thestandard quantity arrangements and increases in the guarantees less than- therise in factor costs, profitability has been increasing as a result of major improve-ments in efficiency on the part of many producers and, over the past year, thefall in feed costs. If output is to be reduced, which in the view of the Govern-ment would be in the interest not only of the nation but of the industry itself,the highest cost production must be discouraged. In present circumstances the Government have had regard also to the importance of the guaranteed price for milk in the economy of many small farms. They have concluded that the necessary reduction in the guaranteed price should be limited to Id.per gallon.18. The production of eggs is still increasing and now meets virtually thewhole of the home demand for shell eggs. The guaranteed price is much higher than the market price and subsidy expenditure is therefore exceptionally heavy in relation to market value. A further reduction in the level of theguarantee is needed to stop the expansion of output; indeed, at anything likeits present cost in subsidy, output needs to be reduced. Accordingly it hasbeen decided that the guaranteed price for hen eggs should be reduced by l d.per dozen.19. The increase in output of beef, the expansion in the numbers of beef-typecows, the sharp increase in the number of calves retained for beef, and in thecase of sheep the substantial and continuing increase in the breeding flock,are signs that the profitability of beef production and of mutton and lambproduction do not need to be increased further. But there is need to continueto encourage the production of quality beef and an increase of Is. Od. per livecwt. is being made in the guaranteed price for fat cattle for the purpose ofincreasing the premium on quality animals. The quality specification is also being raised. Apart from this, there is no change in the guarantees for fatcattle, fat sheep or wool.20. After a period of relative stability in the pig market, production is expand-ing rapidly and market prices are lower compared with the last two years.The subsidy cost is high and will increase substantially as output rises and market prices fall. Some part of the production is being produced at a high cost in resources, including imported feed. The trend of output must be reversed. The guaranteed price is therefore being reduced by 2s. Od. perscore. With a view to providing further encouragement to the improvementof quality, the existing rates of the quality premiums for bacon pigs are being increased by 6d. per score.Crops21. There are large surpluses of wheat in the world, the domestic subsidycost is high at present market prices, and in general wheat is regarded as lesswell-suited to animal feeding than other grain crops. A further reduction of6d. per cwt. is therefore being made in the guaranteed price for wheat.22. No change is being made in the guaranteed prices for barley, oats, rye,sugar beet or potatoes, except for a small increase in the support price forpotatoes to compensate for an increase in the size of the riddle for guaranteepurposes.23. The Government announced after the 1957 Annual Review that they intended to consider whether any alteration should be made in the system of implementing the guarantee for potatoes.   Discussions are proceeding with
representatives of the producers, and while it has not been possible to make anannouncement in time for the 1958 crop, it has been agreed that experience has shown the need for altering the system. A further announcement will bemade before the industry completes its plans for the 1959 crop, i.e. by 1st July,1958.Production Grants24. The Government have reviewed the existing production grants which now amount to nearly  80 million a year. They have decided that there is noscope at present for major alterations or extensions. Some further encourage-ment to the use of nitrogenous fertilisers is, however, practicable and from 1st July next increased rates of subsidy will be fixed for nitrogen involving (atthe rate of consumption in the current year) some  14- million in aggregate. as already announced, grants for rabbit clearance societies are being introduced and an allocation for this purpose has been made within the total of the guarantees.The Small Farmer25. The Government recognise the special problem created by the fact that many small farmers are particularly concerned with the production of milk,pigs and eggs and that many of them have relatively low incomes and smallresources despite the generally satisfactory condition of the agricultural industry. This is a difficult problem which raises social as well as economicissues. The present Marginal Production Schemes are under review and theGovernment are to discuss possible revision of these Schemes, within the scopethat these have so far covered, with the Farmers&apos; Unions.26. The Government intend also to initiate discussions about proposalswhich they are preparing for additional provisions designed to give further assistance to the small full-time farmer.Vn. Effect of Determinations27. The determinations now made are some  2 million above the minimumassured by the Agriculture Act, 1957. The Government are satisfied that thesedeterminations, while meeting the requirements of national policies, can be made without detriment to the industry&apos;s underlying strength and will enable theindustry to maintain a fair and reasonable level of remuneration in accordancewith the Agriculture Act, 1947. In a free economy the net income of theindustry, which has been improving, is affected by many other factors. But,with the support of the guarantees now determined, the industry should be ableto maintain the improvement already achieved and so continue to be assured ofa sound position in the economy of the nation.

(not yet available)Note (i). The estimates of aggregate farming net income in Tables A and B arearrived at after making provision for depreciation and stock appreciation. Net in-come can be defined as the reward for the manual and managerial labour of thefanner and his wife, and for the use of the occupier&apos;s investment.Note (ii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimate is built up fromstatistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses. Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.
Note (iii). The figures for aggregate net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  11 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated asprofit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (iv). From the figures for aggregate net income given in Table A certainsums should have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops,etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

The figures given above exclude minus  28-85 million in respect of changes in feedingstuffs costs which are dealt with automatically by the feed formulaerelating the guarantees for pigs and eggs to the cost of standard rations.Note (hi). The figures for machinery include minus  11-33 million (all products)and minus  8-98 million (review products) for reductions in the cost of machineryfuels and oils. Of these amounts minus  5-76 million and minus  4-57 million res-respectively relate to the cessation of direct payment by farmers of the increase in the tax on petrol introduced in December, 1956 and removed in April, 1957.Note (iv). In addition to the cost changes listed above, account has been taken of a reduction in the funds available under the Marginal Production Schemes as a resultof the narrowing of the scope of the Schemes following the introduction of the farm improvement Scheme. It is reckoned that the net reduction after taking account of continuing payments under other schemes will be approximately  330,000 in a full year.Note (v).

In 1958/59there will be a small reduction in the guaranteed price for hen eggs in Northern Ireland(see paragraph 15 of Part II of this Appendix).(d) The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and wheat are average pricessubject to variation seasonally; the guarantee payments for fat cattle and some fatpigs are subject to variation according to quality; and the method of calculatingfatstock guarantee payments involves an element of estimation. Because themarketings of fatstock and wheat cannot be accurately forecast, producers&apos; averagereturns under the guarantees for those products in any year may be a little more orless than the guaranteed prices. Paragraph- 26 of Part II of this Appendix deals witha similar point in respect of potatoes. The prices guaranteed to the British EggMarketing Board for hen and duck eggs are subject to the profit and loss sharingarrangement referred to in paragraph 13 of Part II of this Appendix.(e) For certain varieties of potatoes the mesh size of the riddle for guaranteepurposes has been increased (see paragraph 23 of Part II of this Appendix).
Part II.   Additional Details of GuaranteesFatstock1. The standard prices will apply to steers and heifers, to lambs and other cleansheep, and to clean home-bred pigs of the same descriptions as those covered by theFatstock Guarantee Scheme, 1957-58, with the following exceptions: (a) Steers and heifers with fat covering so excessive as to depreciate seriously thevalue of the carcase will not be eligible for the guarantee.(b) The minimum eligible weight for steers will be 1\ cwt. live weight (450 lb.dressed carcase weight), and that for heifers will be 6% cwt. live weight(390 lb. dressed carcase weight).(c) A minor change has been made in the definition of the types of male pig towhich the guarantee is inapplicable.The upper weight limits for guarantee payments in respect of eligible stock will remain unchanged.2. As in 1957/58, the standard prices for cattle and sheep shown in column (iii) of table A of this Appendix will be broken down into weekly seasonal standard prices which will be specified later: the rate of guarantee payment in each case will be theamount by which the average of the latest four weeks&apos; actual market prices and theestimated market prices for the following four weeks falls short of the average of the seasonal standard prices for the same eight weeks. For pigs, there will be no seasonalscale, and the rate of guarantee payment will be the amount by which the standard price shown in column (iii) of Table A of this Appendix exceeds the average of thelatest four weeks&apos; actual market prices and the estimated market prices for thefollowing four weeks, including quality premiums.3. As at present the rate of guarantee payment for each group of stock will be calculated weekly and announced before the beginning of the week to which it relates.This announced rate of payment will be subject to a stabilising adjustment in anyweek in which this is necessary to ensure that the average return to producers doesnot differ from the respective standard price (in the case of cattle and sheep, thestandard price for the week in question) by more thanCattle     ............   7s. Od. per live cwt.Sheep     ............2d. per lb. dressed carcase weightPigs       ............4s. Od. per score deadweight4. Steers and heifers and clean sheep imported, removed or brought into the UnitedKingdom will become eligible for guarantee payments after three months of entering the United Kingdom. For the purpose of calculating rates of guarantee payments on such stock in 1958/59, as in 1957/58, the appropriate standard prices will be treatedas reduced by 3s. 6d. per live cwt. for steers and heifers and by Id. per lb. dressedcarcase weight for sheep.5. The weekly rate of guarantee payment for steers and heifers calculated as inparagraph 2 above will be an average rate. As in 1957/58, the rate of payment foranimals qualifying as Grade I will be higher than that for other eligible cattle. Forthe period 31st March, 1958, to 29th June, 1958, the rate of guarantee payment forGrade I will be 6s. 6d. per live cwt. more than that for other eligible cattle and thestandard of eligibility for the higher rate will be the same as that introduced on 1stJuly, 1957. With effect from 30th June, 1958, the rate of guarantee payment forGrade I will be 8s. Od. per live cwt. more than that for other eligible cattle, and thestandard of eligibility for the higher rate will be: (a) Deadweight CertificationThe carcase must be moderately compact and moderately thickly fleshedthroughout with rounds moderately well developed and rounded; loins andribs thick and well fleshed. The neck and shanks must be relatively short.Finish must be reasonable according to the age of the animal but the exteriorfat covering must not be patchy or excessive. If the loins or ribs are onlymoderately thick and moderately well fleshed the carcase will not be excludedfrom Grade I provided it satisfies the specifications for this grade in all other respects.
159(b) Liveweight CertificationThe steer or heifer must, in the opinion of the fatstock officer, be such asto produce a carcase of at least the standard defined in (a) above.6. As in 1957/58, two rates of quality premium will be payable on pigs of 7 scoreto 8 score 5 lb. deadweight with Grade A fat.measurement at all points and of aminimum recorded length (measured from the indentation of the first rib to the loweredge of the aitchbone) of 775 mm. and which are sold on grade and deadweight andcertified at approved bacon factories. A premium of 3s. 6d. per score deadweightwill be payable on such pigs with a recorded length measurement of not less than800 mm.; a premium of 2s. 6d. per score deadweight will be payable on such pigswith a recorded length measurement of less than 800 mm. but not less than 775 mm.The measurement of length will be recorded in multiples of 5 mm., rounding upwards.7. The standard price for pigs shown in col. (iii) of Table A is related to a priceof 26s. 3d. per cwt. for the prescribed standard feed ration. As in previous years,the rate of guarantee payments will be adjusted to take account of variations in feed prices as compared with the standard feed price.8. It was stated in paragraph 27 of the White Paper on the Annual Review and determination of Guarantees, 1955 (Cmd. 9406) that the Government and the farmers&apos; Unions had agreed that capital expenditure on pig progeny testing stationsshould be taken into account in arriving at the global guarantee payments to pigproducers in Great Britain in the financial year 1955/56 and subsequent years. Thelatest estimate of this expenditure is  730,000. In 1958/59 there will be a reductionof Id. per score deadweight (as in previous years) in the guarantee payments for pigsslaughtered in Great Britain for such time as is necessary to recover the balance duefrom the industry. It has also been agreed that for the fatstock year beginning31st March, 1958, there will be a reduction of Id. per score deadweight in the guaranteepayments for pigs slaughtered in Northern Ireland, for such time as is necessary to recover the industry&apos;s share of the capital expenditure incurred on extensions to the pig progeny testing plant in Northern Ireland.Eggs9. As at present, the guaranteed prices will apply to first quality eggs (includingdirty eggs otherwise of first quality), but not to hen eggs weighing less than 11 oz.,sold to the British Egg Marketing Board through packing stations.10. The prices for hen and duck eggs shown in columns (i) and (iii) of Table A ofthis Appendix are prices guaranteed to the Board (subject to the profit and losssharing arrangement described in paragraph 13 below). These guaranteed pricesinclude an allowance for the Board&apos;s administrative costs in operating the guarantee arrangements and marketing expenses (including packers&apos; margins, packaging costs,transport and, in the case of hen eggs, certain trading losses)..11. Ministers will determine the estimated average selling price for fresh hen eggsdelivered to wholesalers in 1958/59, and the estimated average selling price for duckeggs sold in shell by the Board in 1958/59. As already announced, for this purpose the &quot; estimated average selling price &quot; shall be taken to be, for hen eggs and duckeggs respectively, a weighted average of the wholesale selling prices for fresh eggs asascertained by Ministers for the guarantee years 1956/57 and 1957/58. In calculatingsuch weighted average price for hen eggs, the ascertained average price in each year will be weighted according to the quantity of hen eggs on which subsidy has been paid in that year, but such quantity for 1957/58 will be doubled; similarly theascertained average price for duck eggs in each year will be weighted according to thequantity of duck eggs on which subsidy has been paid in that year, but such quantityin 1957/58 will be doubled.12. Flat rates of subsidy will be calculated by subtracting from the guaranteed prices to the Board, shown in column (iii) of Table A of this Appendix, the estimated average selling prices to be determined by Ministers in accordance with the arrange-ments set out in paragraph 11 above.
13. Subject to the terms of a financial agreement to be concluded between theGovernment and the Board, the flat rate subsidies referred to in the previous paragraphwill be paid to the Board in respect of eggs qualifying for the guarantee. As in1957/58, the financial agreement will provide for a profit and loss sharing arrangement under which adjustments will be made in the rate of subsidy if realisations for fresheggs, calculated in accordance with the financial agreement, differ by more than2d. per dozen from the estimated average selling prices referred to in paragraph 11above.14. As for 1957/58, the flat rate subsidies will be subject to adjustment in accordancewith the operation of a feedingstuffs formula for which the standard feed price willbe 25s. 9d. per cwt.15. An amount, at present estimated to total  30,000 in 1958/59, in respect of certainexpenditure on a poultry progeny testing scheme in Northern Ireland will be recoveredby reductions in the guarantee payments relating to hen eggs qualifying for theguarantee in that country.Wool16. As for 1957/58, the guaranteed price will be an average price per lb. to bereceived by the British Wool Marketing Board for home-produced fleece wool fromthe 1958 clip. The guarantee will be implemented in accordance with the provisionsof the financial agreement concluded in November, 1955, between the Governmentand the Board.Milk17. The guarantee for milk in 1958/59 will be on the same basis as in 1957/58.18. As in previous years, the average guaranteed price for the United kingdom will be broken down into separate guaranteed prices for each of the five marketingareas in the United Kingdom; and the guaranteed price for each area will again be related to a standard quantity of milk for that area. The standard quantities for1958/59 will be the same as for 1957/58.19. For each area the guaranteed price will be broken down into a higher price for a primary proportion and a lower price for the remainder of the milk. Thehigher and lower prices will be specified later. The primary proportions in 1958/59will be the same as in 1957/58.Cereals20. All the guaranteed prices for cereals from the 1958 harvest are on the basis ofa deficiency payments scheme similar to that in operation for the 1957 harvest.21. The standard price of wheat will be subject to seasonal variations on broadly the same lines as at present.22. There will be no change in the reductions applied to the United kingdom average yields of barley and oats on account of unmerchantable grain.Potatoes23. The guarantee will apply to ware potatoes of the 1958 crop. The definitionwill be as set out in paragraph 26 of Part II of Appendix V of the White Paper onthe Annual Review and Determination of Guarantees, 1957 (Cmnd. 109), except thatfor the purpose of defining &quot; small potatoes &quot; the square mesh of the riddle shallmeasure between the wires \\ inches in the case of the varieties King Edward, RedKing and Golden Wonder, and If inches in the case of all other varieties.24. The guaranteed price is an average support price for the United Kingdom andwill be converted into average regional support prices, for the three marketing regions of England and Wales, for Scotland and for Northern Ireland, which will be announcedlater.25. The regional support prices will be varied seasonally.
&apos;   nt26. Delivery of most potatoes bought under the guarantee will generally be taken during the latter part of the season, in order to give producers the fullest possible opportunity to do better on the open market than the support price. The average price paid for potatoes actually bought on support is on this account likely to be higher than the guaranteed price shown in column (iii) of Table B of this Appendix,since the guaranteed price will be converted into a scale of prices rising throughoutthe season.Sugar Beet27. As in previous years, the guaranteed price shown in column (iii) of Table B ofthis Appendix is related to beet of 16-5 per cent sugar content. The price differential,plus or minus for each one per cent sugar content, will continue to be 7s. 6d. per ton.28. The guarantee will continue to apply to the produce of the acreage contractedfor by the British Sugar Corporation, in agreement with the Government: and forthe 1958 harvest, as in recent years, this acreage will not exceed 400,000 acres inEngland and Wales and 14,600 acres in Scotland.29. In England and Wales the British Sugar Corporation will bear rail transport costs, for delivery to factories of sugar beet from the 1958 crop, in excess of suchsum as may be declared by the British Transport Commission to represent on1st August, 1958, the average cost per ton of rail freight for 40 miles for sugar beet;but the Corporation will bear no part of the cost of transporting sugar beet by road.As in previous years, to take account of the transport terms in the Corporation^contract for the purchase of sugar beet for processing at its Scottish factory, the priceon which this contract will be based will be Is. 9d. per ton less than the guaranteed price.(30901)   Wt. 1717-4837   K70   3/58   D.L.
