(thjs DOCUMENT is THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 82 COPY NO.21st April, 1958CABINETWAGES POLICY:  NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of HealthA situation has arisen in the committee of the Whitley council which is considering Sir Noel Hall&apos;s report on which I feel it desirableto consult the Cabinet.2.     Agreement has now been reached - subject to a settlement ofthe comprehensive proposals of which they form part - on the salary-scales for the five new general grades recommended by Sir Noel Hall.These scales will have an overall range of  230 to  1,240 as authorised by the Cabinet (C.C.(58) 26th Conclusions, Minute 3).   The main pointsoutstanding are the date of operation of the new scales and the terms onwhich existing staff are to be assimilated to them.   No date has been proposed to the Staff Side but the proposals on assimilation to whichthe Secretary of State for Scotland and I obtained the consent of theCabinet were put to the Staff Side as Ministry proposals on 14th April.3.      These assimilation proposals, which provide for a gradualtransition to the new scales with a limited immediate salary increase,were rejected by the Staff Side, who made counter-proposals.   Inparticular they insisted that the new scale for the basic clerical gradeshould be put into full effect at once by adopting the correspondingpoints principle which is the normal practice in Civil Service pay settlements.   As regards grades above the basic, the Staff Side wereprepared to accept some modification of the corresponding pointsprinciple to limit the absolute amount of increase to be received byhigher paid staff but not to the extent of our proposals.4.      The Staff Side also gave notice that if agreement was not reached on assimilation at the next meeting on 29th April, they would ask theManagement Side to agree to a joint reference to the Industrial Courton this question and also on the operative date, which they propose shouldbe 1st April, 1958.   It is with the implications of this move by the staff side that I am concerned.5.      The first point that arises is whether there are any grounds for maintaining that the issues involved are not arbitrable as such.   I do notthink so.   New salary scales to replace existing salary scales have beenagreed but certain consequential matters are in dispute.   The dispute is between the two Sides of the Whitley Council and the resources of negotiation will have been exhausted.   The fact that the matters in disputearise in connection with the introduction of a new grading structure doesnot seem to me to alter the situation.-1-
6.      It can be argued that the pay scales form part of a package which included tough assimilation terms and therefore it cannot be agreed thatthe Staff Side should take the matter to arbitration on part of the packageonly.   This is an argument which must be put to the Management Sidebut it is not likely to be one that they will readily accept and act on.There are various aspects of our assimilation proposals which havetroubled individual members of the Management Side and so far theyhave not been willing to give their backing to the proposals.   They realisthe consequences of offering an improvement on our assimilationproposals without Ministerial authority and have been considering whetheor not they should approach the Secretary of State and myself to seekfurther negotiating leeway.   Some of them too have been troubled by recent taunting from the Staff Side that they are entirely underMinisterial domination.   For these reasons, the Staff Side proposal togo to arbitration on the assimilation aspects will appeal to many memberof the Management Side as the obvious and stnsible way of dealing witha very awkward situation and one which appears fully in line with government policy as they understand it.7.      The point arises whether pressure should be put on theManagement Side to refuse consent to arbitration by the Industrial Courton the issues in dispute.   I do not think that we should push matters tothose lengths.   The decision lies with the Management Side as suchand if they decided, despite pressure, to go ahead, we could not stop thematter going to arbitration.   We may be able to influence to some extent the terms of reference but not to the extent of altering the substance ofthe reference.   The only action we could take would be to refuse to implement the arbitrators1 award if we did not like it;  this would be amost serious step.   Moreover, if the Management Side cannot be persuaded to refuse arbitration on the terms proposed, it would be embarrassing to reveal that Ministers did not agree with the referenceto arbitration since this could be presented as a complete departure from the attitude we took up last year in connection with withholding ourapproval from the 3 per cent increase when we said that this did not exclude the possibility of arbitration if an arbitrable issue was putforward.8.      In the event of arbitration being refused it might still be possiblefor the Staff Side - if not as a body, then through one of its constituentorganisations which is a trade union - e. g. the National Association ofLocal Government Officers - to secure access to the Industrial DisputesTribunal.   This would be a matter for the Minister of Labour to decide.The possibility, however, will bo in the minds of the Management Sidewhen they take their decision.9.      I am, therefore, seeking the agreement of the Cabinet to my viewthat in regard to the matters in question - the method of assimilatingexisting staff to the new scales and the effective date - we shouldacquiesce in a reference to arbitration by the Industrial Court and abide by the result.D.W.-S.Ministry of Health, W.l.21st April, 1958-2-
