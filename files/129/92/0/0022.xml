confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. April 1958C (58) 72 Copy No.1st April, 1958CABINETWILTON PARKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBackgroundFrom 1946 until last year Wilton Park was operating as an Anglo-GermanInstitution, the entire cost being borne by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Largenumbers of influential Germans came there to study the British way of life andBritish policies. Visitors from other West European countries were also sometimesinvited.2.   The cost of running the Institution on the above lines was  41,000 a year.3. Wilton Park was discontinued as an Anglo-German establishment with effect from July last year. The Cabinet decided on 15th April, 1957, that it should carry on until July this year on a wider European basis, pending a review ofBritish cultural and information services as a whole (C.C. (57) 34th Conclusions,Minute 6). Participating countries were to be asked to contribute financially tothe running of the Institution.Future Plans4. West European countries have on the whole responded favourably to our plan for European sessions at Wilton Park, and arrangements are being made forthese to continue up to July this year.5. Most countries are, however, organising their representation on an annualbasis, and they will now wish to know Her Majesty&apos;s Governments plans for theInstitution after July.6. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s review of the British overseas information Services did not specifically deal with Wilton Park. But it set out thegeneral principle that Great Britain&apos;s full influence can be exercised only if weensure that other countries have every opportunity to understand our ideas, our policies, and our objectives. When I brought the question of Wilton Park beforemy colleagues last year it was my view that Wilton Park could play a valuablepart in demonstrating this country&apos;s intention to remain closely identified with western Europe. This is still my view. It remains more than ever desirable topromote a greater understanding of the principles of British policy towards Europe.Considerable opportunities exist at Wilton Park to influence European opinion inthis respect.7. Participating countries are prepared to share in the. cost of running theInstitution. On this basis the cost to Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be about 25,000 a year. Provision for this has been made in the estimates for 1958-59.recommendation. I would therefore propose to retain Wilton Park on its present Europeanbasis at least until the end of the financial year 1959-60.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,31st March, 1958.53233
