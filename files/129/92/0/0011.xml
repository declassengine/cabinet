annex the FOUNDATION FOR MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN africa south OF THE SAHARAInaugural Meeting: Accra, I9th-20th February, 1958Report by the Leader of the United Kingdom DelegationUnited Kingdom Delegation1. A special meeting of the Commission for Technical Co-operation in africa south of the Sahara (C.C.T.A.) was held in Accra on 19th-20th February to inaugurate the new technical assistance scheme, the Foundation for mutual assistance in Africa South of the Sahara-or farms for short (after the initialsin French). I attended as the United Kingdom representative with a delegationincluding officials from the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Officeand the Colonial Office; we were joined in Accra by three representatives of theBritish African Governments Mr. Madan (Minister without Portfolio, Kenya),Mr. Bademosi (Parliamentary Secretary, Federal Ministry of Research and information, Nigeria) and Mr. Kallon (Parliamentary Secretary, Ministries ofHealth and of Land, Mines and Labour, Sierra Leone).Other Delegations and Observers2. The other member Governments of C.C.T.A. (Belgium, the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland, France, Ghana, Liberia, Portugal and the Union ofSouth Africa) were all represented at the conference; among these the French andGhanaian delegations were the most impressive. The leader of the French delegation was M. Keita, the African Secretaire d&apos;Etat attached to the office of the french prime Minister; the Ghanaian delegation was led by Mr. Gbedemah, the Ministerof Finance, assisted by Mr. Botsio, the Minister of State. In addition to the delegates of member Governments, observers were present on behalf of the UnitedStates Government and of the Governments of Ethiopia and Italy (for Somalia).The Governments of Spain and the Sudan had also been invited to send observersbut did not in the event do so, though the Spanish Government sent a messageexpressing interest and good will. Observers from the United Nations secretariat and the principal United Nations Specialised Agencies were also present.FAMA3. The terms of the Constitution of farms had been agreed in previous negotiations. farms is designed to promote the interchange of technical assistance between the countries in, or with territories in, Africa South of the Sahara andalso to stimulate the supply of technical assistance from other outside sources,e.g., the United States, Canada or Western Germany. Provision has been madein the Constitution whereby potential outside donor countries could, if appropriate,be associated with the work of farms, and the presence of the United Statesobserver at the Accra meeting was a welcome sign of American interest in thenew scheme. The Constitution also provides that those countries in Africa Southof the Sahara which are not at present members of C.C.T.A. (i.e., Ethiopia, theSudan, Spain for her tropical African territories and Italy for Somalia) shall be eligible to receive technical assistance through farms; it is hoped that by thismeans they may be drawn into closer co-operation with and eventual membership of C.C.T.A. itself. The technical assistance to be given under the new scheme will be arranged directly between donor and recipient countries; the function ofthe small central secretariat of farms will merely be to act as a clearing house foroffers of, and requests for, technical assistance. This follows closely the practice ofthe technical assistance side of the Colombo Plan; farms will not, however, be concerned with problems of economic development planning and the supply ofcapital.
Account of the Meeting in Accra4. The main purpose of the meeting in Accra was to mark officially the birth of farms and to give it publicity, especially in Africa. Since the Constitutionhad already been agreed the proceedings at Accra were largely formal in character and were held in public session. The meeting was opened by Dr. Nkrumah, thePrime Minister of&quot; Ghana, who spoke of his Government^ desire to promoteinternational co-operation, and of the value they attached to the work already done by C.C.T.A. in Africa. The same theme was reiterated by the other speakerswho followed him. I had the advantage of speaking second, after the Frenchdelegate, and was able to give suitable stress also to the more practical aspects ofFAMA; in particular, it was my aim to bring out that&apos;the Accra meeting markedthe culmination of the period of preliminary study for the new scheme, not merely the beginning, and that the actual provision of technical assistance could now beput in hand. I had also been able to arrange for each of the three representativesof the British African Governments to speak after me. This gave a usefuldemonstration of their respective Governments&apos; support both for C.C.T.A. andfor farms; it also, of course, made a very good impression locally and in the publicity about the meeting. In short, the conference ran very smoothly, and Ibelieve it achieved its object in getting farms off to a good start.Future Development5. In its initial stages farms will be a relatively small development of thework of a technical organisation which has already existed for some eight years.It has within itself, however, the seeds of growth. Moreover, I think it was significant and valuable that representatives of so many countries and territories in Africa South of the Sahara, despite all differences of race and politicalbackground, should have assembled in this manner and should have discussedconstructively and without political rancour the future of technical co-operation in the area. At a time when Africa is coming more and more into the limelightand when the political divisions in the continent are therefore becoming more andmore dangerous, I believe that developments such as the inauguration of FAMAhave an importance going far beyond their mere technical significance.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd March, 1958.
