C.(&quot;58) 597th March, 1958NORTHERN IRELAND:   UNEMPLOYMENTM e m or and um by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy SealOn 4th March, I saw Lord Brookeborough, the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland.     He told me that the number of unemployed in NorthernIreland had risen to 48,000, more than 10 per cent of the working popula-tion.     This figure was the highest for some years;  the percentage ofunemployed was nearly three times that in Wales and Scotland and morethan five times that in England.    Because of the bank rate and creditsqueeze orders for Northern Ireland manufactures continued to shrinkand he was afraid that the normal seasonal decline in unemployment in the spring would not take place this year.     House building was not expanding,despite the better housing subsidies his Government had arranged;  andhe feared that there was little likelihood of additional employment inagriculture.     His Government had taken and were taking all measureswithin their own control to improve the situation, e. g. by advancing the dates of Government contracts.    These measures of themselves couldnot, however, create many new jobs and he asked that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should do all it could to help Northern Ireland.     The most effective step would be a reduction in bank rate;   but he fully recognisedthat any suggestion that credit should be cheaper in Northern Irelandthan in the rest of the United Kingdom was unacceptable.2.         Lord Brookeborough made a number of suggestions forassistance by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, on which I am consulting mycolleagues.    Of these I need mention only the following:-(l)   The present maximum rate of grant for new Industriesgoing to Northern Ireland should be raised from25 per cent to 33-5 per cent.This proposal, which I think should be accepted, hasthe support of Lord Chandos, who is Chairman of aCommittee to attract new industries to Northern Ireland.He shares Lord Brookeborough&apos;s view that it would beattractive to smaller firms contemplating a move.The cost might be  if millions per annum.    The grantis paid by the Northern Ireland Government but affects the amount of the Imperial contribution.rOPV MOCABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT
(2) The development of public works in Northern ireland in, e. g. , the reclamation of land and the improvementof harbours.These again are matters for the Northern ireland government, but increased expenditure may affect theImperial contribution      I think we should offer toconsider any specific proposals the Northern ireland government may submit to us.(3) The support of the Northern Ireland shipbuilding,aircraft and textile industries by the placing of BritishGovernment orders.I am discussing the Prime Miriister&apos;s suggestionswith my colleagues;   but I do not think we can say moreat present than that Northern Ireland will continue toreceive the same favourable treatment as in the past.3.        A General Election is in progress in Northern Ireland andLord Brookeborough is to address the Ulster Unionist Council on14th March.     He asked that I should let him have a letter which he couldread at that meeting.    Annexed is a draft of such a letter which has beenagreed with the Departments concerned and which I should like theauthority of my colleagues to send to him.4.         I would also ask my colleagues, notwithstanding our owndifficulties, to consider as sympathetically as they can any measures,such as the provision of a dry dock at Belfast and the development of belfast Airport, which would help the unemployment situation inNorthern Ireland.     The seriousness of that situation can be measured bythe fact that its equivalent in Great Britain would be two millionunemployed.     I need not stress the political implications, and indeed theeffects on law and order in Northern Ireland, of its continuation and perhaps deterioration.R*A.B.Home Office, S.W.1.7th March, 1958.-2
CONFIDENTIALDRAFT LETTER TO LORD BROOKESOROUGHSince the very full discussion which we had in London on 4th March, I have been in touch with my colleagues about the employment situation in Northern Ireland and the possibility of further measures toimprove it.     We share your concern over the present level ofunemployment;   and I should like to say categorically and at once thatwe are prepared to help you in any way we can to reduce it.2.         Much has already been done through your own Government andwith the help of Lord Chandos&apos; Committee to attract new industries to northern Ireland;  and Ker Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom have readily agreed to your making available financial and other induce-ments considerably more favourable than any that can be offered in development areas in Great Britain.     I am glad, after consulto-tion withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to be able to tell you that we are nowagreeable to the further step you suggest of increasing from 25 per cent to 33-3- per cent the assistance that can be offered to such newenterprises as will give sufficient employment to justify assistancefrom public funds on this scale.     I trust that this step, which youestimate may cost some  ly millions a year, will enable you to inducemore new undertakings to settle in Northern Ireland.     I need hardly saythat any help the Board of Trade or other Departments of Ker M.ajesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom can give you will always be at yourdisposal.3. You referred to the effect on Northern Ireland of the highinterest rates now prevailing.     I cannot, of course, say how long these will continue.     You will be the first to agree that our over-ridingpriority at present must be to maintain and strengthen the exchange value of sterling, and that we must accept any temporary restraintwhich that involves.     But, subject to this, Her MajestyTs Governmenthave already agreed that the credit restrictions which are in operation in this country should be relaxed in their application to Northern Ireland.I do not think that there is anything more that we can do in this way;but if you feel there are any other steps that we can take, we shallgladly discuss them with you.4.        We have considered also whether there is anything we can do to encourage the fuller use of the resources of labour and materialsavailable in Northern Ireland by direct Government action.    In this field the initiative rests mainly with the Northern Ireland Government;   and my colleagues and I have noted the considerable volume of public worksthat are already in hand and that are planned.    As you will recall, we agreed, as a means of encouraging house building, to make an additionto your subsidy at the time when it was reduced in Great Britain, andthis month we further agreed that this addition should itself beincreased.     We shall consider with the utmost sympathy any further proposals for public works that you may make;  and, insofar asDepartments of the United Kingdom Government have orders to place,Northern Ireland will, of course, continue to receive the same favouredtreatment as she has hitherto enjoyed.-3-
5. In conclusion may I say this?    We fully recognise that theemployment situation in Northern Ireland is one of quite exceptionaldifficulty;  and we shall do everything in our power to assist you and your Government in dealing with it.     The closest and friendliestrelations have long existed between the Departments of your Governmentand those of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and Ican give you the assurance of my colleagues and myself that we shall continue, both personally and through our Departments, to keep in the closest touch wiih the situation in Northern Ireland, and take mostreadily whatever steps we can to assist in the solution of the many and difficult problems with which your Government is faced.Home Office, S.W.1.
