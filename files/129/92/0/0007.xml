confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1958C. (58) 57 Copy No. 5 87th March, 1958CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerDiscussions with the Farmers&apos; UnionsThe Cabinet authorised discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions to be begunon the basis of a schedule of changes in guaranteed prices and production grants which provided for a reduction in the total value of the guarantees of about 21 millions the maximum possible under the long-term assurances given to theindustry through the Agriculture Act, 1957 and included reductions in the guarantees on milk, pigs and eggs (C.C. (58) 16th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. The schedule of guarantee changes given to the Farmers&apos; Unions isattached (Appendix I). This provides for a small reduction in a guarantee on wheatas well as reductions on milk, pigs and eggs, and for small increases on fat cattle(to be used for further encouragement of quality production) and on the nitrogensubsidy.3. The Cabinet agreed that further consideration should be given, both tothe total value of the guarantees and to the prices for individual commodities, inthe light of the views advanced on behalf of the industry.4. The Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review have considered thecase put forward on behalf of the industry. The Farmers&apos; Unions cannot acceptthe Governments proposed changes either on the total value of the guaranteesor on the commodities. They would be prepared to submit to their Councilsproposals that included a net reduction in the guarantees of some  5 millionworth of &quot; adjustments &quot; of the guarantees for pigs, eggs, milk and wheat, butonly if these were offset by increases in the prices of other commodities and in production grants that would in their view help the producers chieiiy concerned.5. The case put forward by the Unions follows the expected line. Theydo not accept the weight given by the Government to Exchequer liability and thenational economic situation, or to the commodity objectives; they represent thatthe Government have given too little weight to the position of the industry in real terms as compared with the rest of the community and that the government&apos;s proposals would mean a further deterioration in the relative position of the industry.6. Although the Unions might come down a little below their minus 5 millions, perhaps by another  5 millions, there seems to be no prospect of theircoming near to the maximum permissible reduction of  21 millions. But they have accepted in principle that reductions should be made on the guarantees on milk,pigs, eggs and wheat.7. We cannot accept the Unions&apos; view of the implications for the net income of the industry of the Governmenfs proposals. We are satisfied thata determination at or near to the minimum permissible under the long-term assurances should still leave the industry in a sound position and that such a determination is essential if the wider national considerations and the importantcommodity considerations are to be met.  If this view is accepted, we shall have to53127CONFIDENTIALB
impose upon the Farmers&apos; Unions a determination in total at or near the permissibleminimum and including reductions on milk, pigs and eggs that they will also resist.8. We now seek a Cabinet decision on the final conclusions that should be putby the Agricultural Ministers to the Farmers&apos; Unions.Total Value of the Guarantees9. On economic grounds none of us deny that there are the strongest possiblearguments for the maximum reduction of  21 millions. The question is whether on political and psychological grounds of presentation we should make a reductionabout  2 millions above the minimum, i.e., of-about  19 millions.My Own Views on the Total10. I believe that on the cold logic of the facts there is no case at all for any concession. Indeed, it seems to me that this is exactly the combination of circumstances which justifies a minimum award and at the same time proves theworth to the agricultural industry of the long-term assurances. If we teel inhibitedfrom making the minimum award this year, I wonder whether we shall ever do so.We shall be making the 24- per cent, limitation of the long-term assurances more restrictive than was ever intended. If we make the minimum award this year, theNational Farmers&apos; Unions will have no justification for claiming that it is our settled policy to go to the limit every year. Last year we made an award of plus some 14 millions against the minimum of plus  8 millions.11. Our reply to criticism that the repeal of Part II of the Agriculture Act.1947, is an indirect attack on the guarantee system of Part I is that this has beengiven additional strength by the long-term assurances. If even this year these donot operate, it may be wondered whether they are of value and whether we canclaim credit for them.12. A concession of  2 millions however it is made will benefit the largefarmer as well as the small man; if as we must assume this will be an imposedsettlement, I doubt whether we shall get much thanks for a concession.The Views of the Agricultural Ministers13. The Agricultural Ministers on the other hand feel that it would be a mistake to insist on the full reduction. The Government will in any case bereducing at one time the guarantee on milk, pigs and eggs the three commoditieson which most of the smaller farmers depend for their living; this is something thathas hitherto deliberately been avoided. There is no relief that can be given to thesmall farmer at present in other directions.14. Nothing that can be done will help materially with the Farmers&apos; Unions,but the severity of the Government^ determination could be justified much better to farming opinion that does not take part in farming politics if it could be shownthat, despite the economic strength of their case, the Government were not squeezingthe utmost out of their bargain. The Government could still claim credit for thelong-term assurances. These were intended to tell the industry the worst that could happen. It does not require a determination at the minimum to prove their value. The Government are in any case making a severe determination that canbe presented as taking account of all the economic considerations but also making some small allowance for the difficulties of the smaller farmers. In future years it would still be possible to go to the limit if other considerations justified that.Certainly the Agricultural Ministers do not agree that in the first year after thepassing of the Agriculture Act, 1957, it can reasonably be suggested that what they propose creates a precedent for not going to the minimum under the long-term assurances.Guarantees on Commodities and Production Grants15. Should the Cabinet decide that the total must stand at minus  21 millionswe have no alterations to propose in the distribution of the reductions from thatshown in Appendix I.16. We have, however, examined the possibilities for altering the scheduleshould the Cabinet agree to a smaller reduction in the total, say to minus  19 millions.
Any such adjustment should be one that helps particularly the smaller farmers.There is no acceptable proposal open to us for any further increase in any of theproduction grants or for any new production grant. The only possibility in thatfield is an increase in the calf subsidy which is already very high and we cannot recommend this. Nor do we recommend any increase in any of the guaranteed prices; fat cattle is the only possibility that would be at all in line with policy andthis would not help the smaller farmers.17. The choice accordingly appears to lie within the sphere of lesser reductions on either milk, pigs or eggs.18. The Minister of Agriculture recommends that the proposed reduction inthe guaranteed price for milk should be Id. a gallon instead of Ik/. a difference of about  2 millions and the Secretary of State for Scotland concurs. milk production is of the widest interest to small farmers in the United Kingdom as awhole. There have been increases (totalling lk/.) in the guaranteed price in eachof the last three years. A reduction of Id. a gallon now, which means  8 millions,would be just as good as l d. to provide the necessary psychological effect on milkproducers as well as a sufficient defence against oversea critics. At the same time itwill still mean roughly no substantial change in profitability when account has beentaken of the fall in feed costs and the continuing increase in efficiency, and this could be represented to the Unions as a really useful concession. Moreover it neednot be any burden on the Exchequer.19. Northern Ireland would much prefer lesser reductions in the guaranteeson pigs and eggs which are very important in the economy of their small farmers.They hold that experience has shown that pig producers respond quickly to anychange in price levels and that with a reduction in the guarantee of Is. 9d. perscore production would be discouraged just as markedly as if the cut were 2s.They also think that the reduction on eggs should be lessened by \d. per dozen,i.e., should be Ik/, instead of 1-k/. These changes would mean a concession ofabout  1-6 millions as compared with  2 millions on milk.20. On balance the Farm Price Review Committee felt that a lesser reduction on milk was to be preferred to lesser reductions on pigs and eggs. But even thatwould in my view be very undesirable and underlines the difficulty of making any concession. It is no comfort to point to the smallness of the subsidy; thisis what the Government choose to make it since the Government control the pricepaid by the consumer. The waste of national resources, to say nothing of our commercial embarrassments, requires us to cut the price of milk as much as wecan. However, the Minister of Agriculture takes the view that a cut of no morethan Id. a gallon will give small farmers some help until his proposals referredto in the next paragraph can become effective.Small Farmers21. The Minister of Agriculture is anxious to include in the Annual review white Paper an undertaking to consider the possibility of adding to the existingmarginal production schemes provisions designed to help further the small full-time farmer. A draft paragraph for this purpose is attached at Appendix II.Officials have been working on such proposals and, although a good deal stillneeds to be done on this, including consultations with the Farmers&apos; Unions, weare advised that there is good prospect of being able to work out an acceptableand useful scheme which would improve the viability of considerable numbersof full-time small farms. We are agreed that this would be a sound objective and that a paragraph in the White Paper would help us in presenting our annual review determinations. On the other hand it is just possible that legislation might be required and we do not know what might be acceptable to the Farmers&apos;Unions.Points for Decision22. On behalf of the Farm Price Review Committee I invite the Cabinetto decide:-(i) whether we should keep to a reduction of  21 millions in the total valueof the guarantees or should accept the Agricultural Ministers&apos; proposalto bring this down to minus  19 millions;CONFIDENTIAL53127 b 2
(ii) if we should make a total reduction of  19 millions, whether we should do this by reducing the guaranteed price on milk by Id. a gallon insteadof \d. a gallon as the Minister of Agriculture recommends, or whether we should do it by reducing the guaranteed price of pigs by Is. 9d.instead of 2s. a score and the guaranteed price of eggs by l-\d. insteadof \%d. a dozen as Northern Ireland would prefer;(hi) whether in any event we should undertake to consider the possibility of helping the small farmer further and should include a passage to that effect in the Annual Review White Paper;(iv) that the Agricultural Ministers should be -invited to present theGovernments conclusions to the leaders of the Farmers&apos; Unions and toreport back finally thereafter to the Cabinet.D.

APPENDIX ii draft paragraph for White PaperSmall Farmers and Marginal Production schemes the Government recognise the special problem created by the fact that many small farmers are particularly concerned with the production of milk, pigs and eggs and that many of them have relatively low incomes and small resourcesdespite the generally satisfactory condition of the agricultural industry. This isan intractable problem which raises social as well as economic issues. The presentmarginal production schemes are under review and the Government propose todiscuss with the Farmers&apos; Unions not only possible revision of these schemes,within the scope that they have so far covered, but also the possibility of addingprovisions designed to help further the small full-time farmer. At the same timethe Government will be prepared to consider with the Farmers&apos; Unions any otherpracticable proposals for assisting small farmers that may come up in the courseof such discussion.March 1958.
