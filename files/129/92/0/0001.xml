C- (58) 51 Copy No.25th February, 1958CABINETGOVERNMENT OFFICESMemorandum by the Minister of Works.      .    . . &apos;In answer to a Parliamentary Question last July regarding the accommodation of Government Departments in highly-rented districts, I stated that it was myDepartments policy to make the best possible bargain in each case, having regardto the amount of accommodation required, the suitability of the premises and, inthe case of a proposal involving the erection of new buildings, the date when theywould be ready for occupation. I cannot think that my colleagues would have wished me to answer otherwise. I am now under obligation to give effect to my statement.2. The present lease of Berkeley Square House for the Ministry of transport and Civil Aviation terminates in September 1959, and carries a rent of 8s. persquare foot. I carried negotiations for a new lease to the penultimate stage, on thebasis of paying Ms. per square foot. The landlords suddenly changed their mindsand expressed the view that they would prefer not to grant me a new lease becausethey expected to be able to obtain around 21s. per square foot from a commercialclient, and suggested that if we refused to move out, the matter would have to goto the High Court under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954. This would be extremely unsatisfactory for the Government, because we should be in completeuncertainty until the Courts decision. The renewed lease, if granted, might be foran inconvenient period of time and the rent would probably be in the neighbourhoodof 25s. per square foot.3. At the same time, I have received an offer from developers to build on aSouthwark Street site a building designed to meet the requirements of the Ministryof Transport and Civil Aviation. It would accommodate not only the Headquarters&apos;staff in Berkeley Square House, but also the Roads Section from Chepstow place and the Civil Aviation officials who are at present in Russell Square. I estimate thatthe saving of rent would be approximately  70,000 a year, and I should obtainpossession for other Government Departments of the premises in Chepstow place and Russell Square.4. The Minister of Transports suggestion of Horseferry Road or Victoriaas alternative sites for their Headquarters would not avoid the necessity for resort to the High Court as these buildings could not possibly be ready by 1961, whichis as long as the owners of Berkeley Square House would allow us voluntarily toremain in occupation. A case taken to the High Court to retain Berkeley SquareHouse for a Government Department would be bound to attract considerablepublicity. I doubt whether Conservative supporters in the House and the country would be edified by the spectacle of our resorting to the Courts to remain in a building whose owners wished to get rid of us.5. I have never considered that the W. 1 area is particularly convenient forGovernment Offices and I am strongly of opinion that we should not pay the highrents which are charged in this fashionable area. Although I do not accept the.doctrine that more Government Departments should be concentrated close to theHouse of Commons, Southwark Street is only six minutes by car from the House53072CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJKSTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

of Commons and is not less accessible than Berkeley Square House. I believe itto be the intention of the L.C.C. to encourage the redevelopment of the Surreyside for offices and I have no doubt that they will succeed in greatly improving the social status of Southwark Street, which is conveniently located between london Bridge and Waterloo Stations. The Central Electricity Board have alreadyerected a massive office block beside the site which I propose for the Ministry ofTransport and Civil Aviation.6. In view of these financial and planning considerations I ask the Cabinetto judge as reasonable my proposal to accommodate the Ministry of transport and Civil Aviation on this site.A. H. E. M.Ministry of Works, S.E. I,12th February, 1958.CONFIDENTIAL
