12th May, 1958CABINETYICELAND;   FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsEfforts are still being made in the North Atlantic treaty organisation  and through the United States Embassy in Reykjavik to persuade the Icelandic Government to enter into talks and not to declarea unilateral extension of their fishery limits.   If these efforts fail, andif the Icelandic Government within the next few days make a unilateralextension of their fishery limits, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will at once be expected to make a public announcement of their attitude towards the icelandic declaration.2.        Subject to the agreement of my colleagues, I propose to say thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government do not accept any diminution of their rightson the high seas and that they do not recognise the unilateral decision ofthe Icelandic Government to extend their fishery limits.3.         This raises the vitally important question, which will at once beasked by Parliament and the fishing industry, whether Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared and will make effective arrangements to protect british vessels fishing within the area of the high seas over which the icelandic Government propose to extend their jurisdiction in fisherymatters.4.         The argurrtents in favour of a decision to grant such protectionare:-(a) we regard ourselves as legally entitled to grant it;(b) to abdicate this right in favour of Iceland might encourageother countries to make similar unilateral declarationsextending their fishery limits, their territorial waters, or both;(c) Parliament and the fishing industry will expect Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to maintain and assert the right to protect british fishing vessels on the high seas, especially as we have the shipsavailable;(d) a declaration of the intention to grant such protection wouldprobably be the only way of preventing the imposition of alandings boycott by our industry if the Icelanders extend theirfishery limits beyond six miles from present baselines.   past experience showed that such a boycott diverts Icelandic exportsto the Soviet bloc  and does more harm than good.-1-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 99 COPY NO. t-
5. The arguments against the immediate declaration of an intentionto grant naval protection to our fishing vessels are:-(a) political opinion in the world at large is apt to condemn the useof force against a small country such as Iceland.   At the geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea, Iceland enjoyed muchsympathy;  and would no doubt do so if the matter came to theUnited Nations;(b) the United States air base at Keflavik and their radarinstallations are vitally important to the defence of the West.The United States Government are doing their best to restrain the Icelandic Government from extending their fishery limits,and the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, has saidprivately that he would regard the arrest by Icelandic fishery protection vessels of foreign vessels fishing on the high seaswithin the area to which the Icelanders may claim to have extended their jurisdiction in fishery matters as an act of aggression;   but in the last resort the United States government might wish us to abstain from any action which might imperiltheir defence installations in Iceland.6. I have informed Mr. Dulles that Her Majesty&apos;s Government mayhave to make a statement announcing their determination to protect british fishing vessels within the area of the high seas over which the icelandic Government propose to extend their jurisdiction in fisherymatters, and I have invited his comments.recommendations. I invite my colleagues to agree that:-(a) subject to the views which Mr. Dulles may express, any declaration by Ker Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of a unilateral extension of Icelandic fishery limits should includethe statement that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will protect british fishing vessels within the area of the high seas over which the Icelandic Government have announced their intentionof extending their jurisdiction in fishery matters;(b) subject to agreement on (a), that the fishing industry should beasked, in consideration for the assurance that they will be protected, not to re-impose a boycott of landings of Icelandicfish;(c) that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, inconjunction with the Admiralty, should be invited to study and submit recommendations for methods for the protection of Britisfishing vessels in the area concerned which would leave withthe Icelanders the onus of using force.(d) that in the meantime efforts should continue to bring the Icelanderto talks.S.L.
