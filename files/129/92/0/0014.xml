C.(58) 6427th March, 1958CABINETRENT ACT:    AMELIORATION OF HARDSHIPMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI am bound to inform the Cabinet that there can be no doubtthat a number of the 800,000 tenants of houses and flats decontrolledunder Section 11(1) of the Rent Act, 1957 (i. e. , dwellings of more than 40 rateable value in London and Scotland,  30 rateable valueelsewhere) will be exposed to eviction when the standstill period onpossession runs out next October.   Though the number of tenantslikely to be in this position will be a tiny minority of the whole, itcan hardly be less than several thousand.     If only 3 per cent of alldecontrolled families are involved, the figure will be about 25,000.2. Tenants at risk of eviction will be found mainly in London,Glasgow, and some other big towns, and in resorts like Worthing andCheltenham with a high proportion of retired people.   Some of them will doubtless be unreasonable or bad tenants with little or no claim tosympathy;  but most are likely to be decent and deserving tenantsfaced with homelessness through no fault of their own - simply becausethey have been unable either to get their landlord to make a new agreement, or to rent or buy other suitable accommodation.      Many ofthem will be elderly people with limited means, whose eviction by anunsympathetic landlord will create strong public feeling.3. For help to be given to such tenants where they deservehelp, legislation would be necessary.   The thought of having to legislateis thoroughly distasteful.   But the alternative is in my view that weshould be forced by public opinion to pass emergency legislation undergreat   pressure   in October or November:  and that would be worst of all.4. In agreement with the Secretary of State for Scotland I have therefore thought it right to formulate proposals, for the considerationof the Cabinet, to give a degree of temporary protection to tenants for whom eviction would entail serious hardship, while at the same timemaintaining the principle of decontrol and providing an incentive to both landlords and tenants to enter into fresh agreements.   I am notprepared to advocate any departure from the main purposes and structure of the Rent Act.    But we have never declared ourselvesagainst smoothing the transition;  indeed, the House of Commonsresolved on 3rd March to support the Government in all measures necessary to achieve these purposes in a fair and reasonable manner.-1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of... - ---Br^J^-.......llua^ V^vTOP SECRET Copy No.-.)........
5. The measure proposed is summarised below.   It isconceived essentially as a first-aid operation to give temporary relief to the residual hard core of cases that is bound to exist next October -so as to avoid actual homelessness and to give some extra time forthe tenant to find new accommodation.SUMMARY OF proposals. (i)    The County Court, which as things are cannot givea stay of eviction for more than four to six weeks-at the maximum, will be empowered to give a longerstay in appropriate cases under certain conditions.(ii)    No landlord will be entitled to regain possession without an Order of the Court.(iii) When the landlord&apos;s application for such an Order isbefore the Court, the tenant will have a right to seekpostponement of possession.(iv) The right to seek such postponement will be limited tothe case where the tenant (or a member of his family)has been in occupation of the  premises since beforethe introduction of the Bill for the Rent Act,i. e. , November, 1956.(v) To succeed in obtaining a postponement of possession,the tenant will have to satisfy the Court -(a) that he has made a reasonable attempt tonegotiate a new agreement with his landlord;(b) that he has made every reasonable effort(regard being had to age, infirmity or disability)to obtain alternative accommodation adequate tothe needs of his family, and within his means;and(c) that in all the circumstances of the casedispossession will inflict greater hardship on him than failure to regain possession for thetime being will upon the landlord.(vi) If the tenant can satisfy these tests, he may be allowedremain in occupation for not less than three or morethan nine months from the date of the Courfsdecision.   He can also seek an extension, or further extension, of postponement subject to the same tests.(vii)   The tenant will be required to pay a notional rent equalto the &quot;controlled&quot; rent of twice gross value from6th October, 1950 until the date on which the landlord1 application for an Order is determined.    If postponement of possession is granted, the tenant will then have topay a rent of 21 times gross value throughout theperiod of postponement - subject however to powerto the Court to fix a lower rent (but not less than twicegross value) if satisfied that the tenant cannot afford to pay Z\ times gross value.-2-TOP SECRET
(viii)  In view of the different rent structure, there will bea different provision on notional rent for Scotland.(ix) The same mortgage restrictions as to foreclosure and interest will apply for such time as the landlord isdenied possession under these provisions as would apply if the premises had not been decontrolled.(x) It is proposed that these provisions should operate forthree years from the passing of the Act.7. A Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Bill is in preparation to give effect to these proposals.   If the policy is approved, it is in my view desirable that it should be announced toParliament next week before the Easter recess, and the legislationproceeded with as quickly as possible between Easter and Whitsun.H.B.Ministry of Housing and Local Government,S.W.I.26th March, 1958-3-
