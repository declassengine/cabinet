Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1958The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issuedtor the personal use of......................................................TOP SECRET Copy No. 60C. (58) 6828th March, 1958CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME:   1958-59 session memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy seal the Future Legislation Committee have recently completed, with the assistanceof all Ministers whose interests are affected, a comprehensive review of thelegislative programme for the next session. The candidates for inclusion number104 and include many for which room has not been found in the current or earliersessions.   The Committee have classified these Bills in the following categories :  I.   List A. Essential Bills, subdivided into :  List A.l. Bills known to be essential.List A.2. Bills which may become essential in certain circumstances.II.   List B. Programme Bills, subdivided into:  .  List B.l. Main programme Bills.List B.2. Other programme Bills.III.   List C-Other Bills.2. It is desirable that the legislative programme for the last full session ofthis Parliament should be no heavier than is necessary. It is important that our supporters should not be as tied to Standing Committees as they have been this session, and we must avoid an over-brimming programme. Even if some of the bills in List A.1 can be enacted during the current session and some of the bills in List A.2 prove to be unnecessary it is improbable that we shall be able to find time, in addition, for many of the Bills in List B.2 besides those in List B.l.3. Not all the items in List B.1 are yet certain. The legislation on compensation for the Compulsory Acquisition of Land depends on a cabinet decision which remains to be taken, and it is also not yet clear how far it will bepossible by the Bill, or Bills, on Economic Controls (with which might be combinedone or more of the Bills in List B.2) finally to implement the Governments pledge to repeal the emergency legislation on which these controls depend and to replaceit, to the minimum extent necessary, by permanent legislation. The committee consider, however, that List B.1 would provide a substantial and acceptableprogramme of positive legislation, particularly as regards social reform, and thatthe Bills in this List should be supplemented by as many of the Bills in List B.2 as time allows. The Bills in List C can clearly have no entitlement to a place in theprogramme at the present stage; but a few of them might be reconsideredsubsequently in the light of developments.4. It is essential that all our main Bills, particularly those which will bereferred to Standing Committees, should be ready for introduction at the very53209
beginning of the new session. I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree that the bills in Lists A. 1, A.2, B.1 and B.2 should be regarded as constituting the material fromwhich the final selection for next session&apos;s programme will, in due course, have tobe made and that the Ministers concerned should now proceed, as rapidly aspossible, to obtain the necessary policy clearance (where this has not already beendone) and to give instructions to the draftsman. Priority of drafting should begiven to the Bills in Lists A.1, A.2 (where appropriate) and B.1, pendingconsideration, at a later stage, of the extent to which it will be possible to include some of the Bills in List B.2 in the final programme..R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.I,28th March, 1958.
