LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILVACCINATION AGAINST POLIOMYELITISIN RELATION TO THE PRESENT SHORTAGE OF supplies on Saturday, 26th April, 1958, the Medical research council met to reconsider the advice that they had giver, toyou in their minute of 21st April.     They reviewed again allthe medical and scientific evidence available on the risksattending the use of the various poliomyelitis vaccines hot/being produced, on the risks in different circumstances of leaving a large number of young persons unvaccinated during thelate spring and early summer months of this year, and all theinformation provided on the present and anticipated short-fall of supplies.      After carefully reconsidering all the conflictingfactors in this complex situation, they tendered the followingrevised advice *1a     In order of safety, the three vaccines under considerationcan be placed as follows:-(a) British type vaccine that has successfully passedBritish safety tests;(b) Salic vaccine that has successfully passed &quot;bothAmerican and British safety tests;(c) Salk vaccine that has successfully passed Americantests.The Council are now satisfied that the risk of producingpoliomyelitis by injecting any one of these three vaccines isslight;    and that the degree of protection, against contractingthe natural disease conferred by any one is substantially greater than the risk that it will produce poliomyelitis.Nevertheless, the risks exist, and, that being the case,it is impossible to subscribe to the use of either of the-1-
CONFIDENTIAL ----    272less safe vaccines, save as a temporary expedient in thepresence of an emergency of such a degree as would outweighboth the risk of producing cases by   inoculation and the contingent loss of public confidence in the medical profession that v/ould follow this,2.     The Council reaffirm their view that British-type vaccinethat has successfully passed British safety tests, is thesafest poliomyelitis vaccine available;    that the onlyJustifiable permanent policy is to use every endeavour toproduce this in such quantities as to meet all the needs ofthis country;    and that any policy which has recourse to either of the less safe vaccines can only be regarded as atemporary expedient*3*      Next in order of acceptability is Salk-type vaccine thathas passed successfully both British and American safety tests*In advising that such vaccines should be issued to meetthe shortage of supplies in 1957 (Minute to Lord President,25th July, 1957), the Medical Research Council stressed that,in their view, such a measure was only justifiable -(1)    as a temporary expedient until adequate suppliesof British-type vaccine were available;(ii)    if the vaccine were submitted to the full range of British safety tests as carried out by theMedical Research Council on. British-type vaccine;(iii)    if the medical profession and public werewarned that this vaccine was less safe than theBritish type and given a free choice betweenthe two.-2-
U.      Least acceptable is Salk-type vaccine which., althoughit has successfully passed American safety tests, has notbeen submitted to the British tests as carried cut by theMedical Research Council in this country.The present problem arises because supplies both ofBritish-type vaccine and Salk vaccine that have passed bcthAmerican and British tests are together insufficient tc meet requirements, and cannot become sufficient in time to prevent a substantial deficit during the summer months when tneincidence of natural poliomyelitis will increase.After carefully re-examining the situation produced bythis further short-fall of supplies, the Medical research council concluded regretfully that they must advise, as afurther   expedient, that consideration should be given toissuing Salk-type vaccine which had not been submitted toBritish tests, as a temporary measure to supplement theinadequate supplies now available, or foreseeable in theimmediate future, of British-type vaccine and 3alk-typevaccine that has passed both British and. American safetybests.In proffering this opinion, however, the medical research Council wish to stress that their advice is not that Salk vaccine untested in t?ii-3 country, should be usedto replace, in ary way, the two types of vaccine at presentin use in this country.     On the contrary they feel thatthere should be no slackening in the endeavour to obtainthe maximum supplies of these two vaccines;    and thatthe plans to achieve this, now under consideration,should in no way be curtailed.     The role of Salk-typevaccine untested in this country is, in their opinion,-3-
limited to that of a temporary supplement to the maximum possible production of British-type vaccine and Salk-typevaccine which has passed &quot;both British and American tests.5.      Should it Je agreed to issue Salk vaccine as atempory supplement in this present emergency my council would urge that &quot;both the medical profession and the public should T*e made aware that,  although the risk to theindividual from its use is small, it is the least safe ofthe three poljomyelitis vaccines that will he offered to them;and that they snould he assured that they will have a freechoice between the three vaccines,  although, should theirchoice fall on a vaccine in short supply, this may entailsome delay in their being vaccinated.6.      Consideration was given to the possibility that,consequent upon doubts as to the safety of Salk vaccineuntested in this country, the uptake might &quot;se insufficient to use such supplies as were made available.      In thisconnection they would drav/ your attention tc paragraph 15of their Minute  bo you of 21st april, 1958.This was to the effect that such vaccine would presumably he in ampoules when bought and, therefore,unsuitable for the minimal range of safety tests &quot;becausepreservative would have been added;    but that manufacturersusually retained samples untreated with preservative for thepurpose of applying retrospective safety tests if necessary.It is advised that the purchase of Salk vaccine for usewithout further tests in this country should be made conditional on untreated samples being made availablehere..      These should b:j held in store,      If then,  any
Salk vaccine remains unused at the time when the productionof British-type vaccine and Salk-type vaccine tested&quot;both in America and here, catches up with the deficit,it can &quot;be recalled, British s&apos;afety tests put in hand and,if these are satisfactory, the vaccine could ultimately be upgraded into the category of Salk vaccine which hassuccessfully passed both our and -&amp;he American tests.As there will be a continuing demand for suchdoubly tested vaccine for some time to come, wastewould thus be avoided.7.     My Council also considered whether, if Salk vaccinewere imported for use without further tests in thiscountry, any distribution of priority claims apon thethree types of vaccine which would then be available,could do anything to mitigate the risks of the present emergency.They had in mind that, generally speaking, olderchildren and children who had had one injection ofvaccine were more likely to be resistant to the developmentof poliomyelitis consequent upon the injection of vaccinecontaining live virus.      They advised, therefore,  that(a) the first claim on available supplies ofBritish-type vaccine, and failing these on supplies of Salk vaccine which had success-fully passed both British and American tests,should be to give two injections to children under 5 years of age;(b) that the second priority claim on suppliesof these two vaccines should be to give thefirst injection to older children;-5-
(c)    that, only as a last resort, should Salkvaccine untested in this country he usedfor the first injection and every endeavourshould be made to see that this practicewas confined to children in the olderage-groups registered.8.      It is understood that Canadian Salk vaccinefor export to this country is not now being checked by theCanadian Government safety-testing organisation;    thatis, it is only being tested by the manufacturer.      they feel, therefore, that such vaccine ought not to be issued for use here until it has passed the Medical research council^ safety tests in the ordinary way.9*      My Council considered the suggestion that had beenmade that they might abridge the present series of safety tests they now employ.      They felt that thissuggestion derived its support from a mistaken calculation of the saving in time that might thus result.      Themaximum saving in time would be two weeks.  over theperiod of deficit in the present emergency.But even hod the saving in time been significants,they felt that they could not agree to this suggestion.In the light of present knowledge, any curtailing inthe present safety tests would lower their presentefficiency.      Should any mishap follow the use of a vaccine- and no safety tests based on sampling can ever beperfect - the only defence is that all knownmeasures had been taken to eliminate risk.      This couldnot be said if the tests were curtailed.COMFIDE INITIAL
10.     Lastly, my Council wish, to reaffirm the advice thatthey gave in paragraph 1 h of their minute to you of21st April.In a production process so complicated,  and so subjectto unpredictable and incomprehensible setbacks, as that required for the manufacture of poliomyelitis vaccine, theonly safeguard against recurring crises of the present kindlies in the holding of a reserve of tested vaccine adequateboth to offset short-falls in production and allow a marginfor meeting demand which has exceeded anticipation.At this present stage of the vaccination programmeagainst poliomyelitis, the numbers yet to be vaccinated andthe impending need of giving a third injection ensure thatsuch a reserve will not he wasted.11.      To summarise, therefore -(a) My Council feel that in the present emergency itwould be justifiable to consider making available Salkvaccine which has not passed the safety tests of the medical research Council,  in addition to British-type vaccine andSalk vaccine that has passed both British and American tests,provided that the relative risks of each are made known tothe medical profession and the public,  and that both doctors and recipients are free to choose whether or not they will use it.(b) In my Council&apos;s view the use of Salk vaccineuntested in this country can only be justified as a temporary expedient during the present emergency, and then only as asupplement to the supplies of the other two and safervaccines.
(Signed)  H.P.  HIMSWORTHSecretary,Medical Research Council27th April. 1958( c)    In the opinion of my Council,  the presentendeavour should, be to press forward with a programme for obtaining the maximum possible supplies of British vaccineand Salk vaccine which has satisfied both American andBritish tests so that,  at the earliest possible moment, theneed to use Salic vaccine untested in this country will disappear.Thereafter,  endeavour should be concentrated onaugmenting the supplies of British vaccine so that we maycease issuing Salic vaccine of any kind and come to relyentirely on the safest known vaccine, that of the Britishtype.But, as long as vaccination against poliomyelitis isrequired it will be necessary to carry a reserve supply to offset any unpredictable failures in production.
