(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(5g) 79 COPY NO.^14th April, 1958CABINETTHE YEMENMemorandum by the Minister   of State for Colonial affairs on 14th March the Defence Committee (D.(58) 4th Meeting,Item 1) considered a proposal by the Chiefs of Staff that inter alia theCommander, British Forces, Arabian Peninsula should be givendiscretion to retaliate against guns firing against targets in the aden protectorate from inhabited villages on the Yemen side of the border,subject to the following limitations:-(i)  no bombing of guns sited in inhabited villages to becarried out:  precision air attacks against such guns to be limited to rockets and cannon fire;(ii)   retaliatory action as above to be restricted to field guns and anti-aircraft guns which have opened fire;suspected gun positions not to be attacked.2. The Defence Committee decided that before any decision was taken on this matter:-(a) our legal and treaty rights in the area in question should be further examined;  and(b) a draft Parliamentary statement should be prepared on lines indicated in the discussion.3. On 24th March the Colonial    Secretary submitted to thePrime Minister a note on Her Majesty&apos;s Governments legal positionin the Aden Protectorate, which had been seen by Foreign Office and colonial Office lawyers.   Accopy of this note, minus its appendices,is attached as Annex &apos;A&apos;.   The Defence Committee considered thematter further on 11th April, and decided to refer it to the Cabineton 14th April (D. (58) 7th Meeting, Item 2).4. With regard to the Parliamentary statement a draftarranged Parliamentary Question and written Reply was prepared bythe Colonial Office and, after it had been agreed with the Governor of aden and the Commander, British Forces, Arabian Peninsula, was circulated to the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and Air Ministry.The Ministry of Defence and the A.ir Ministry concurred, and a copy of-1-
the draft as agreed with those Departments is attached as Annex &apos;B&apos;.The comments of the Foreign Office are still awaited, but I understandtheir views to be that if it is decided that an extension of counter-battery action against Yemeni guns should be authorised and that apublic statement on the subject should be made, then this draft statement would be appropriate for the purpose.5. I consider that extension of counter-battery action againstYemeni guns of the kind proposed should be authorised and that, if itis agreed that publicity for such a decision in the form of a parliamentary statement is desirable, then the draft statement at annex &apos;B&apos; should be made.6. I therefore ask the Cabinet:-(a) to approve the proposal set out in paragraph 1above, and, if so,(b) to agree that a written Parliamentary statement should be made as soon as possible in replyto an arranged Question in the terms of annex &apos;B*.P.Colonial Office, S.W.1.14th April, 1958
ANNEX &apos;A&apos;LEGAL POSITION OF HER MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTIN THE ADEN PROTECTORATEThe Western and Eastern Aden Protectorates are made upof twenty-three States (eighteen in the West and five in the East), whichare separate and independent of each other and other Powers.   Thelegal and constitutional position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theProtectorates rests fundamentally on the Protectorate Treaties whichwere concluded with the ancestors of the present Rulers of each ofthese States in the 19th and early 20th centuries.   The first of theseProtectorate Treaties was concluded soon after the occupation of Adenby the British in 1839;  the last was with the Audhali Sultan in 1914,Under these Treaties Ker Majesty&apos;s Government undertakes to giveprotection to the States and the States undertake not to enter intorelations with foreign powers without the knowledge and sanction ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government also exercises jurisdiction inthe Aden Protectorate by usage and sufferance, and this has beenformalised from time to time by the Aden Protectorate Orders inCouncil, 1937 to 1956, which were made under the Foreign JurisdictionAct, 1890.   The main object of these Orders is to give Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment jurisdiction over non-natives in the Protectorate (e.g.dealings with Petroleum Concessions Limited, who hold an explorationpermit in the Portectorate, are regulated under the Order in Council).3. The majority of the Proectorate States also have AdvisoryTreaties with Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the first of which was concluded with the Quaiti Sultan of Qishn and Socotra in 1954.   Underthese Advisory Treaties the States undertake to accept the advice ofthe Governor of Aden on matters connected with their own internalwelfare.   The authority of Her Majesty&apos;s Government over the internal affairs of the States is limited, and the right to advise Rulers is verysparingly used in practice.Aden/Yemeni Boundary4. Before the First World War   the Yemen was part of theTurkish Empire.   In the years 1905 to 1906, an Anglo/Turkish boundary commission demaracated the boundary as far as the Wadi 3ana.   Thisagreement was ratified by the Anglo/Turkish Convention in 1914, and atthe same time the undemarcated boundary beyond the Wadi Bana wasdefined by a&quot;vxue.iorth-east line&quot; known as the Violet Line.   Under theTreaty of Lausanne of 1923 the Turks surrendered all their Arabterritory;  and the Imam of the Yemen refused to recognise the validity of the Anglo/Turkish Convention although the independent Yemen, asa successor State to the Turkish Empire, should have been bound by it.
5. In 1934 an Anglo/Yemeni Treaty was concluded by which theexisting de facto boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemenwas to be recognised by both parties until such time as a definitiveboundary settlement was made.   As compared with the Anglo/Turkishboundary, there is in this 1934 boundary a considerable salient across &quot;the Violet Line in favour of the Yemen.   This salient consists of whatis now the Yemeni Province of Beidha, and was ceded to the Yemen atthe time of the Treaty because the Emir of Beidha was not in a treatyrelation with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.6. Article 3 of the 1934 Treaty states that &quot;the settlement ofthe question of the southern frontier of the Yemen is deferred pendingthe conclusion.......... of the negotiations which shall take place between them (the parties) before the expiry of the period of the presentTreaty /T. e. before 19747-&quot;Pending the conclusion of the negotiations referred to in thepreceding paragraph, the high contracting parties agree to maintainthe situation existing in regard to the frontier on the date of the signature of the Treaty, and both high contracting parties undertake thatthey will prevent, by all means si their disposal, any violation bytheir forces of the above-mentioned frontier, and any interference bytheir subjects, or from their side of that frontier, with the affairs ofthe people inhabiting the other side of the said frontier. &quot;7. Despite the acceptance of the de facto boundary in the 1934Treaty, quarrels with the Yemen over the boundary persisted.   Underthe Anglo/Yemeni Agreement of 1951 the Yemen undertook to set up with Her Majesty&apos;s Government a joint Boundary Commission todemarcate in certain disputed areas the position of each party as ithad existed in 1934 in the limitrophe areas.   The Yemenis have notfulfilled this undertaking.   The 1951 Agreement, despite the vaguenessof the wording, may be regarded as recognition that a de facto boundaryexisted.8. All the Treaties and Agreements referred to in the precedingseven paragraphs were freely negotiated and are considered valid under international law.-4
ANNEX &apos;B&apos;DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND STATEMENTMr.............M.P. :  To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonieswhat action is being taken to carry out the obligations of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the protection of those Rulers in the Aden protectorate and their people who are being subjected to gunfire and other forms of attack from the Yemen,The scale of &quot;Yemeni provocation and attack, particularly by fire fromguns of various calibres across the frontier, has been increasing andhas led to some casualites among the tribespeople of the /. denProtectorate and the Security Forces.  Appropriate military measures are being taken, and not without success.   These have included counter-battery action by aircraft when necessary.   Recently, however, therehas been a tendency for Yemeni gun positions to shelter in or nearinhabited villages.   The guns in such positions have not hitherto been attacked, but it will be clear that such restraint cannot continue to beexerciaed indefinitely as we have a duty to protect the lives and propertyof the people of the Protectorate and of our own Forces.   If gunscontinue to be placed in such positions and used for unprovoked offensive action against the Protectorate, they will be liable to precision attack.If it does become necessary to attack them for reasons of legitimateself-defence, our aircraft would use guns or rockets, which are weapons of precision, so as to reduce to a minimum the risk of civilian casualties.Bombs would not be used.   In general the Yemen&apos;s intentions towardsthe Protectorate give cause for grave anxiety and the possibility ofreference to the United Nations is still being considered, as stated by my Right Honourable Friend on 19th February, but no conclusion has yet been reached.-5-
