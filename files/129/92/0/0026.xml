PRIME minister attach as an Appendix a note on the major wage claims that we knowabout and expect.     It is more difficult to draw any particularconclusions from them to guide us in economic policy matters.     Theseseem to be the main points.(1)       This year there is little chance of a break in what we have come to call the annual round.     I can&apos;t see a time ahead which would be reasonably free.     Buses and railways may well occupy us till the end ofApril.     It is towards the end of April that the coalminers may go to arbitration.     In turn the engineering and shipbuilding industries finishtheir standstill in May and the claim will start which will probably bein the negotiating machine until September or October.     lie cannot thencount on any particular time when the waters will be entirely calm.(2)       I think the Appendix makes clear that the Government is alittle lonely in its struggle against wage inflation.     Y/hat you mightcall our front and that of the nationalised industries has been firmlyheld, but private employers, particularly in those industries covered bywages councils, have been freely giving increases of the order of5 per cent.     The national newspapers have made no stand at all againstpay demands and their latest offer for an increase is likely to be acceptedby the unions.     Typically, I am afraid, they will not publish in theirnewspapers any details of this.     But, of course, they will still writeleaders saying how weak the Government is in its wages policy.(3)       In spite of all the prophets, the general industrial relationssituation still remains remarkably good, and far better than I thoughtpossible a few months ago.     It would be foolish to count on thiscontinuing but there is at least a chance that it may.28TH MARCH. 1958 IAIN MACLEOD-1-TOP SECRET
APPENDIX1.        Wage claims which have &quot;been presented but not yet decidedcover some 3z million workers.     The major claims are those Tor railvays(including shopmen) of 475,000, building and civil engineering (l,100,000),coalmining (3&amp;\3,000), electricity and gas (150,000), local authorities(375,000), retail drapers (435,000).     Included in the total figure areLondon bus workers and National Health Service clerks, etc.2.        Railway workers (other than shopmen) are being dealt with bythe tribunal;   coalminers have yet to reach arbitration (possibly endApril);   little has been heard of the gas claim after its rejection inOctober, 1957;   the claim for electricity workers has just gone to theemployers;    and so has the claim for local authority manual workers;   the retail drapers&apos; claim reached the Wages Council on 26th March;   building and civil engineering have had their cost-of-living sliding scaleincreases and, though the unions may go to arbitration, they are notshowing much activity yet.     Last year they did not follow up their claim after rejection by the employers.     In the meantime proposals have&quot;been issued by nine wages councils for increased rates;    they are of theorder of 4-5 per cent increases, i.e. roughly the cost-of-livingincrease.     With the exception of the retail co-operative award ofTit per cent this figure of 4-5 per cent is general for all settlementsreached since October, 1957 - except for smaller increases resultingfrom sliding scale agreements (e.g. building 2 per cent).It seems fair to assume that (apart perhaps from nationalised industries) this will continue to be the pattern to be followed whereagreement is reached bet-ween the parties or where wages councils operate.3.        For the moment there seems to be a reluctance on the part ofunions to press their claims to finality but, on the other hand, from september, 1957 &quot;to February, 1958, 3f million workers - about the same number as for the corresponding season of 195^-57 - got increases.This figure of 3^: million included such large blocks as agriculture,building and civil engineering,   iron and steel,   printing, catering,Government industrials, clothing, G.P.0. manipulatives, retail co-operatives.     The total sum involved in increased rates over the periodSeptember, 1957 - March, 1958, is  1^ millions, i.e. rather less thanTs.^&amp;. per head of those 3f millions benefiting.4. Apart from claims which are already known to have been presented, others are likely to be on the way, e.g. agriculture (perhapsearly summer), chemicals and port transport (shortly), provincial buses,and the remainder of the shop workers.If a claim is made for engineering and shipbuilding workersthis would no doubt be presented in May.5.        To sum up;   some 3:f million workers have already had increases to date from September;   2-g- millions (i.e., excluding building) at leasthave claims in and a further indefinite number will be covered by claimsnot at present tabled..    But the 2-g- million&apos;-;include some of the hardestnuts to crack;   of them 1^. million workers are in nationalised industries.sliding scale agreements-2-

PRIME minister as a supplement to my minute on the progress of v,rage claims,you might like to know the provisional March unemployment figures.2. The total at 4-33,000 is 9,000 more on the 17th March than onthe 17th February.     Seasonally adjusted, this is an increase of27,000.     The rate of unemployment goes from 1.9 to 2 per cent.     It has only been exceeded since the war in March, 194-7, in the unreal and temporary conditions of the fuel shortage.3. The nuiiber of unfilled vacancies is 217,000, or 8,000 morethan in February, but seasonally adjusted this represents a fall of13,000 and vacancies have been showing a non-seasonal fall since october.     There is no indication that this v,dll come to an end.4-. These figures are not very cheerful ones and it seems quite clear, as I warned the House in recent debates, that the seasonalimprovement this year will not be as marked as usual nor will it beginso early.28TH MARCH, 1938 IAIN MACLEOD-3-
