secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1958Copy No.CABINETSUMMIT TALKSMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in their Aide Memoire of 26th April to the three Western Powers the SovietGovernment refer to the principle of parity of representation as &quot; a basic principle for defining the composition of a meeting at the highest level &quot; and make it plain that their intention is to apply the principle also to all preparatory meetings,excepting only individual interviews between the Soviet Minister of Foreign affairs and Western Ambassadors.The purpose of this paper is to set out the arguments for and against theWestern Powers conceding the principle.1. Arguments for Conceding the Principle(a) Public opinion generally would regard it as reasonable and fair that bothsides should be equally represented in a negotiation of this sort between two groups.(b) It would make hardly any practical difference to the negotiation. the satellites would almost certainly follow the Soviet line. However, if Poland, forexample, showed some independence the Western Powers would benefit.(c) Parity of representation is realistic.  It reflects the balance of power.2. Arguments against Conceding the Principle(a) Concession of parity at a Summit meeting would probably result in increased Russian pressure for parity in bodies of the United Nations Organisation,at least those charged with further negotiations between the Communist bloc andthe free world, such as the Disarmament Commission, in which the Western majorityis already tenuous as a result of the recent expansion of the Commission and theDisarmament Sub-Committee.(b) If we agreed to parity it would make the meetings unwieldy. Under a commitment made to the Italian Government largely for Italian electoral reasonswe are bound to press for their inclusion at a Foreign Ministers&apos; and at a summit meeting. Parity would then require the presence of three satellites. But a conference with eight participants would make business very difficult.(c) When experience showed that the meetings were too large to be business-like it would be open to the Russians to suggest reducing the numbers to one aside, themselves and the United States. If we had conceded parity it might bedifficult to resist this. It is the logical end of the principle. Although there arearguments in favour of the United States Government negotiating alone the dangerwould be that if they did not agree with the Russians on any particular point andSummit talks for that reason did not take place or failed, then they would be blamedby public opinion in many Western countries. This would produce a rift in theWestern Alliance.(d) Once a precedent had been established for parity it would become evenmore difficult to pin the Russians down on their Four-Power responsibilities for Germany.It may be that argument (a) for conceding the principle will prove to be the overriding one. However, the arguments against are powerful and at the momentboth the Americans and the French are firmly opposed to the idea. It is clear thatthe concession would be a major one, and that the Western Powers should not makeit lightly.S. L.C. (58) 965th May, 195853399
