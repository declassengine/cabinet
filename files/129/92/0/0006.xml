secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA.IESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1958C. (58) 56 Copy No. 567th March, 1958CABINETUNITED KINGDOM LIABILITIESNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues may wish to know what, at the best estimate 1 can make, we shallhave to find to meet our liabilities over the next six years for the service of debt andby the running down of the sterling balances.2. The following table sets out an estimate of the likely cost of our debtservice *  1958    1959    1960   1961    1962    1963  millionsService of United Kingdomdollar liabilities......      115      170      180      180      110      105The figures assume that we shall not take any &quot; bisques &quot; to relieve ourobligation to pay principal and interest on the original North American loans. Each&quot; bisque &quot; would save us  65 millions in a year ; but we have only got six &quot; bisques &quot;to last us until A.D. 2001.3. In addition we have to provide for further withdrawals of overseas sterling holdings. To the extent that such withdrawals do not go to finance UnitedKingdom exports they represent an additional call on the gold and dollar reserves.The total holdings of overseas countries now stand at over  3,200 millions. Ofthese(a)  550 millions belong to non-sterling countries.   They have been runningthese down over recent years until they are in general little more thanworking balances. But they could be run down further if confidence in the pound were again shaken.(b) The sterling balances of the sterling area countries were run down by about 150 millions in 1957 and on present forecasts we expect them to rundown by at least  300 millions in 1958. There are strong forces making for continued reduction in 1959 even if the world recession is over by then. In recent months the rest of the sterling area has been a netdrawer on the gold and dollar reserves and this is likely to continue inthe current year.4. Against this our reserves stand at present at rather over  900 millions.This is enough to buy our imports for three months. They may rise to  950 millionsduring the current month.5. There are private holdings of dollar securities in United Kingdom handsamounting on a very rough estimate to some  900 millions. But they could notbe made available to support sterling without legislation for their compulsory acquisition: a formidable undertaking in peacetime. The Government^ ownholdings of dollar securities, managed by the Exchange Equalisation Account,amount to some  250 millions. About half of these are already pledged as collateralfor our drawing upon the Export-Import Bank, and at present values the restwould be needed for the same purpose if we drew the other half of theExport-Import Bank loan.53128
6. In short we have low reserves and large contractual and other claimsupon them. It will certainly be a major task to earn the dollars required to repay the International Monetary Fund and the Export-Import Bank in the next two orthree years. It is in my view essential that we should raise dollars in all legitimateways which are open to us and which do not themselves throw doubt upon oursolvency.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,7th March, 1958.
