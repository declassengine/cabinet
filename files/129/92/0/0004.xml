I CONFIDENTIAL^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)C.(5S) 54COPY NO.27th February, 1958CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Attorney-G eneralI shall report  orally to the Cabinet on the discussions up to date at the International Conference on the Law of the Sea.2.     The questions which I feel fall to be decided are:-(l)  Whether in the event of our efforts to retain the three milesby itself not proving successful we should support theAmerican compromise of three miles plus twelve fishing,backed as it now is by the Canadians.The Americans have been lobbying for this, but as fishing rightsand the breadth of territorial waters are being taken by separatecommittees there is a very real chance that the exclusive fishing rightswill be conceded and the limit at the same time extended.   The Indianproposal that any State should go to twelve miles for territorial watersif it wishes might easily be linked with the majority of the Conferencesaying that in any event a State should have twelve miles exclusive fishing rights.     My view is that the American proposal will not succeed in stemming the demand for an extension of the territorial waters limit.If we join with them in supporting their proposal, I feel we shall seriously prejudice our chances of subsequently challenging before theInternational Court claims for exclusive fishing rights outside territorial waters - claims which are not recognised by internationallaw.   On the other hand our abstention from supporting the Americancompromise is not likely to enhance its chances of success and might -though I think it is unlikely - arouse opposition from the Americans.   Ithink it is necessary that I should disclose our attitude on this question to the United States delegate on my return.(2)   Whether we should now start advocating a fail-backSir Gerald Fitzmaurice, the Foreign   Office  legal adviser, and i feel that this has a very considerable chance of success.   India of her own free will has gone to six miles.    We understand that Greece wouldbe prepared to go back to six miles.    Sir Gerald Fitamaurice&apos;s view and my own is that a proposal for a six-mile limit offers the best hope of avoiding a twelve-mile limit if we have to abandon three miles.   If thedecision is that we should put forward this as a fall-back position, then we would have to consider whether this should be instead of the american proposal or as a second line of defence if the American proposal fails.I feel that putting forward two compromises might weaken the chances of acceptance of either;  and if we lose on the three-mile limit I believe itits worth plumping for the six-mile proposal.    We would of course alsoseek to preserve rights of passage for warships without prior authorisationand rights of passage for aircraft outside the three miles.    I shouldposition to the six-mile limit..w
CONFIDENTIAL48perhaps add that in my view our chances of avoiding twelve milesdepend in no small degree on our being able to formulate a satisfactoryoutline of general fishery conservation measures.(3)  What line should we adopt with regard to the proposal on nuclear tests .This will be put forward as a.limited proposal to abolish testsat sea on account of the damage they are alleged to do to fish.   but of course the debate will broaden out and cover the whole questionof tests.   If there was an amendment tabled on this, we should, imagine, seek to oppose it to the best of our ability.   If on the otherhand there is no more than a pious resolution our position may be morediffcult.   I feel that all I can do now is to draw the attention of theCabinet to the virtual certainty of a debate on this subj ect.   The view is held by some that on this question the Conference might break down.3.    I should add that there is a substantial body of opinion in favourof postponing the question of territorial waters until further considerationof the fisheries question.   If this occurred and the Conference broke down on nuclear tests then we might be able to avoid any decision onterritorial waters, but I would add that the pressure for a decisionextending those waters is strong.R. M-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C.2.26th February, 1958-2-CONFIDENTIAL
