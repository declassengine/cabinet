Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1958C. (58) 92 Copy No. 6 01st May, 1958CABINETSECURITY IN THE COLONIESNote by the Lord ChancellorA Committee of Ministers &quot; to review the existing organisation of armed forces, police and security services in Colonial territories,&quot; under the chairmanship of Lord Swinton as Commonwealth Secretary, was set up in January 1955 as aresult of a Cabinet decision (C.C. (54) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 1). ThisCommittee, as Chairman of which I succeeded Lord Swinton in June 1955,comprised the Colonial Secretary, the Minister of Defence, the Secretary of Statefor War, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and the Financial Secretary,Treasury. The Secretary of State for Air joined the Committee in June 1955.At their first meeting the Committee invited Sir Gerald Templer to carry out a review of Colonial Security, and in July 1955 they presented an interim reportto the Cabinet (CP. (55) 89) dealing with those of Sir Gerald Templer&apos;srecommendations which the Committee were then able to accept, and indicating the action which was being taken on those recommendations which would require futher examination. On the basis of this report the Cabinet instructed (CM. (55)26th Conclusions, Minute 6, Conclusion (3)) that the Committee should remainin being and should report further on:  (i) the military aspects of Sir Gerald Templer&apos;s report; and(ii) the progress made in giving effect to the approved recommendations on police and security services in Colonial territories.2. Our report on these subjects is attached. We regret that it has not beenpossible to present this final report at an earlier date, the more so as the long delayhas not, in the event, enabled a settlement to be reached on the main issue whichhas been holding us up the question of a United Kingdom contribution to thecost of improved housing for Colonial police forces. We accept that present economic circumstances have rendered impossible any such contribution in thecurrent financial year, but we are very concerned about the long-term effects ofneglecting to make proper provision for this service. We have therefore recommended that the possibility of suoh a contribution should be re-examinedlater this year with a view to providing for the necessary expenditure in the coming financial year.3. We do not consider it necessary or desirable that the Committee shouldcontinue to receive reports of further progress concerning those of Sir GeraldTempler&apos;s recommendations which are still in course of implementation, and wetherefore recommend that the Committee should now be wound up.K.Lord Chancellors Department, S.W. 1,30th April, 1958.53378SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRJTANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT
REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON SECURITY IN THE COLONIES1.   Military Aspects of Sir Gerald Templer&apos;s ReportCertain of Sir Gerald Templer&apos;s major recommendations on military aspectsof Colonial security, concerning the future role of the Colonial forces, the controlof expenditure, and the replacement of War Office administration by colonial government administration, have already been approved in principle by Ministers(CM. (55) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6) and have now been implemented in practice.The other main recommendations on military aspects were as follows:  2.   Provision of British Officers to Colonial Military ForcesSir Gerald Templer recommended that the provision of local officers should beincreased and that British officers seconded to Colonial forces should enjoy improvedterms of service. Following protracted interdepartmental discussions, improvedterms and conditions of service have now been approved subject to certainTreasury reservations for British officers volunteering for secondment to colonial and Commonwealth Government forces. Their application however depends on the willingness of the Government concerned to implement them and until they are more widely applied it is doubtful whether a sufficient flow of volunteers on thebasis of an adequate period of service will be obtained. Negotiations are now proceeding for the implementation of the new terms and conditions in the east african, Sierra Leonean and Nigerian military forces and their application to officersserving with the local forces in Aden and British Somaliland.3.   Local Military Forces and the Command Structure in AfricaMinisters agreed (CM. (55) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6, Conclusion (1)) thatthe administration by the War Office of Colonial forces should be brought to anend, in each case when local circumstances permitted. The East african governments assumed control of and administrative and full financial responsibilityfor the East African local forces from 1st July, 1957. The forces have beenreorganised on an internal security basis, although retaining a central commandstructure. In West Africa the Nigerian military forces reverted to local control and administration on 1st April, 1958, and are to be reorganised to provide economies,particularly on the administrative side, without loss of efficiency. The Gambiamilitary forces reverted to local control on 1st January, 1958, but in view of theexpense of maintaining a separate military establishment they were replaced at theend of March 1958 by a police striking force. Negotiations are taking place forthe transfer to local control of the Sierra Leone military forces on 1st January, 1959,although formal agreement has yet to be reached with the Sierra Leone Government;meanwhile the forces are being reorganised in accordance with proposals based on sir Gerald Templer&apos;s recommendations.With the transfer of the Gold Coast military forces to local control on 1st July,1956, Headquarters West Africa Command was abolished. The West african governments however appointed a Military Adviser responsible to them. Thewithdrawal of the Ghana Government from this arrangement on achievingindependence and the winding up of the Gambia military forces has made theappointment unnecessary and the post has been terminated.In the Caribbean, the Governor-General&apos;s Advisory Council of the West Indieshas agreed as an interim measure to take over responsibility for, and financing of,the Jamaica Regiment from 1st April, 1958, until the end of the year, and to enterinto discussions on questions concerning the defence of the Federation. these would include the possibility of the West India Regiment being re-formed out of theJamaica Regiment from 1st January, 1959, as the nucleus of the Federation^defence forces.4. Use of the Strategic Reserve -    -Sir Gerald Templer recommended that a Brigade of the Strategic Reserve shouldbe trained for internal security duties in the Colonies. In addition, a smalladministrative, police and intelligence increment should be earmarked for despatch to any territory to which military reinforcements might be sent.
The Brigade has been earmarked and organised for Colonial security duties,and although it has proved impracticable to implement the second part ofSir Gerald Templer&apos;s recommendation there has been very close co-operationbetween the Colonial Office, the Security Brigade and the Police Staff College.Sir Gerald Templer also recommended that light aircraft should be provided forco-operation with the Colonial Internal Security Brigade and arrangements to thisend have been made.5. Colonial Defence Contributions and Military LandsThese two topics were accurately described by Sir Gerald Templer as &quot; bonesof contention &quot; but he made no recommendations beyond urging that the genera!question of the terms upon which lands are made available for military use in theColonies and upon which they are surrendered when no longer required shouldbe tackled without delay. The particular case in Mauritius which attractedSir Gerald Templer&apos;s attention has been settled: to some extent the question ofservice tenure of land in the Colonies has been dealt with under local DefenceAgreements.6. As regards contributions from the Colonial Territories towards the cost ofdefence, the Oversea Defence Committee of the Cabinet has recommended thefollowing financial arrangements, which in our view should be adopted:  (a) Colonial Governments should be expected to bear the cost of maintaininginternal security and should assistance from United Kingdom fundsbe necessary in individual cases, appropriate provision should be madein the Colonial Services Vote.(b) If it is necessary in the interests of Commonwealth Defence generally to maintain Colonial forces beyond the scale required for internal security, the additional cost involved would normally have to be met from United Kingdom Defence Votes; this should not preclude thoseColonial Governments which are able to meet their own internal securitycosts from being asked, or offering, to make contributions towards thecost of Commonwealth Defence generally.(c) In addition Colonial Governments should aim at assuming full financial responsibility for local defence though, where necessary, assistance wouldbe given as in (a) above. Where special strategic interests warrant sucha step Her Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to meet the cost from united Kingdom Defence Votes.II.-RECOMMENDATIONS ON POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES in colonial TERRITORIES7. The following paragraphs indicate the progress which has been madesince the Committee presented its interim report in implementing those ofSir Gerald Templer&apos;s recommendations in this field which the Committee regardedas of particular importance and accepted.8. Colonial Office establishmentThe Cabinet endorsed Sir Gerald Templer&apos;s recommendations that police and Intelligence departments should be established in the Colonial Office and suchdepartments came into being in 1955. In addition, a Deputy Security IntelligenceAdviser and two additional Deputy Inspectors-General of Colonial Police havebeen appointed to advise the Colonial Secretary.9. Local Intelligence committee as recommended by Sir Gerald Templer, the guidance given to governors of Colonial territories about the functions of Local Intelligence Committees andthe form of those Committees&apos; reports has, in consultation with the joint intelligence Committee, been reviewed and revised.10. Re-issue of the Charter of the Joint Intelligence Committee and representationof the Colonial Office on the Joint Intelligence staff revised Charter of the Joint Intelligence Committee, including the colonial secretary as a sponsor, has been issued.   WSth regard to representation of the
Colonial Office at meetings of the Joint Intelligence Staff, the Colonial secretary had concluded that this was best achieved by the attendance of an official fromthe geographical section concerned, aided as necessary by a member of the intelligence and Security Department when appropriate matters were being discussed. In view however of feeling among some members of the Committeethat there would be advantage in a greater continuity of Colonial Officerepresentation at meetings of the Joint Intelligence Staff this question is, with theagreement of the Colonial Secretary, being re-examined by officials.11. Regional police training collegesSir Gerald Templer recommended that regional police training colleges shouldbe set up in the Far East, in East, West and Central Africa, and in the West Indies,with assistance if necessary from the United Kingdom. For varying reasons thishas not yet been possible, but the Colonial Secretary hopes that colleges will soon be established in East Africa and in the Caribbean. An application for a grantof Colonial Development and Welfare Funds towards the cost of the former isbeing considered. The Colonial Secretary intends to maintain pressure uponthe Governments of the other areas with a view to securing adequate training facilities in each region, even if full-scale regional colleges are not now practicable12. Police HousingSir Gerald Templer recommended that the question of police housing shouldreceive more energetic and urgent attention. Substantial programmes of policehousing have been approved in Cyprus, Fiji, Mauritius, Nyasaland and Trinidad,while Jamaica has also made a start on a small scale. In the remaining territories concerned, all of which are in the Caribbean area, the question has now becomeone of finding the estimated total cost of  900,000. The Treasury and the ColonialOffice have not been able to agree on the way in which such funds might be found,and in present economic circumstances the Colonial Secretary has agreed with regret not to press further for such assistance to be given in the coming financialyear. While accepting this situation, the Committee feels grave concern aboutthe long-term effects of neglecting to make proper provision for police housing in the Colonies and recommends that the Colonial Secretary should raise thematter again when the estimates for 1959-60 are being prepared.April 1958.
