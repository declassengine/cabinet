COPY NO. ?jOCABINETPOLIOMYELITIS VACCINATIONMemorandum by the Minister of HealthProgrammeLast year the Cabinet decided that the vaccination programrae for1958 should include the vaccination before the summer of such of the priority groups (i. e, , children under 15, expectant mothers and some small miscellaneous groups) as registered for it (C.C. (5?) 66thConclusions, Minute l).2.      The numbers involved in this programme depend upon the extentof registration, which is a continuing process.    Registration to datesuggests that at least 60 per cent of these groups will register by the summer.3.      The programme therefore requires:-Vaccine (for 60 per cent) forVaccine issued forVaccine required forSupplies4.      The flow of supplies has been seriously checked.     Delays indelivery of vaccine have occurred in each of the four original sources of supply, two British firms, one Canadian and one in the U.S.A.;   ineach of the four cases the cause of delay was different.5.      The net effect is:-Total vaccine required (para-graph 3) for . . .    42 million personsVaccine now expected beforeend of June for ...    if- million personsNo vaccine available beforeend of June (the normalstart of the real polioseason) for ...    2-1 million persons-1-C.(58) 8422nd April, 195S7^: million persons3^- million persons4^ million persons(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Problem6.      The problem is therefore how to vaccinate, within the Governmenfsprogramme and before the main ravages of the polio season, the residual 2* million children and others.Factors7.      The relevant factors are supply, testing, and the mechanics ofvaccination.     I do not expect insuperable difficulties with regard to the acceleration of mechanics, at any rate in the period May to July.8.      In regard to supply, the Home Affairs Committee authorised on18th April (H.A.(58) 8th Meeting, Item 4(1)) the purchase of 4,000 litresof Salk for immediate delivery, i. e.  &quot;off the shelf&quot;, if available.This when added to vaccine already ordered will make sufficient vaccineavailable, assuming no new unforeseen check.     Enquiries for this arealready in train, and I believe it can be imported within a matter ofdays.     Its subsequent availability for use and contribution to theproblem depend entirely on the question of British testing.Tests9. Tests are for safety, potency and sterility,types of safety tests-There are threeTest     Stage AppliedA Pre-blendingstrainsB Post-blendingFinalcontainersMIethodTissuecultureTissuecultureInjectionofmonkeysTime taken      Done by(8 weeks((minimum)(10 weeks((average)(6 weeks((minimum)(8 weeks((average)ManufactureronlyManufacturer and)Medical Research)Council )Manufacturer and)Medical Research)Council )10.      It follows that, if the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.) applytheir present procedure of safety tests B and C in full, there will be aminimum period of 10 weeks (or 12 on average) for testing (plus theperiod of one to two weeks from release date for distribution) before any of the 4 million doses can be brought into use.     They would not become available until well on in August, i. e. , right at the heart ofthe polio period, at a time when the holiday season would prevent an intensive vaccination programme.Medical Research councils views11.     In these circumstances, I sought the views of the M.R.C. on thequestion whether, as a temporary measure to meet present difficulties, American Salk vaccine should be used without M.R.C.testing.
The M.R.C&apos;s advice is contained in a minute to the Lord Presidentof the Council, a copy of which is attached.    It will be seen from paragraph 10 of this minute that they have advised against the issue ofSalk vaccine which has not been subjected to safety tests in this country.The M.R.C. also considered whether the present safety testsmight be shortened. For the reasons set out in paragraph 11 of the minute their advice is against this too.Considerations12. Though technical advice is important, the decision is an administrative and political one, and having studied the M.Pv.C&apos;s adviceI think the following considerations are relevant.(i)  All tests, wherever done, are only sample tests.     Theycannot exclude risk and can only minimise it.(ii)   Though additional tests no doubt reduce risks, there isno clear dividing line between risk and safety, andthe reduction is relative only.(iii) It is probably possible for injections even of testedvaccine to induce polio, but there can be no certaintyin individual cases as post-injection polio may alsobe induced by natural causes.(iv) The M.R.C. do not carry out any tests basically different from those carried out by the manufacturers, ncr dothey at present carry out full tests.     They repeat twoof the three safety tests with different samples inaddition to the potency test, but they do not carry outsafety test A.(v) The M.R.C. tests have detected no flaw in the batches ofSalk so far imported.    The live virus in the recentAmerican batch was discovered in the United States bytest A, which is not in any event applied by the M.R.C.(vi) If testing by the M.R.C. was omitted altogether, the tests applied to Salk vaccine by the United Statesmanufacturers taken together with those of the UnitedStates Government (done at the National Institute ofHealth, Bethesda) would represent at least as muchas (and probably more than) the minimum laid downby Regulations under our Therapeutic SubstancesAct.(vii) I understand that enough monkeys will be available atweekly intervals to permit the carrying out of safety test C (and potency test) to the additional supplies of Salk becoming available .(viii)  Parents already have the right to reject Salk if theyprefer to wait for British vaccine.    There is no obligation on anybody to be vaccinated with anyvaccine, however tested, or indeed to register atall.
13.     Over and above these points, there is the broad point that abridgedtests would materially reduce the delay that would otherwise occur in theprogress of vaccination.     In effect with full tests of the vaccination ofthose in the priority groups who register would not be completed untilthe end of September.    Adoption of abridged tests would bring this dateforward by about six weeks.     If Salk were used without any furtherM.R3C. testing, the decisive factor would then not be supply but the rate &apos;of vaccination and it might be possible to conclude the programme by theend of June a.nd certainly in the course of July.14.    Abridged testing has these further advantages over full testing.It allows the delivery of substantial quantities of vaccine in June and july, i. e. , at a time when public opinion is likely to be especially critical of any short fall of supplies;  and secondly it avoids a large distributionof vaccine in August, which from the point of view of vaccination isclearly a very inconvenient month by reason of school holidays andholiday absences of general practitioners and local authority staff.Conclusion15. I ask the Cabinet therefore -(a)to authorise the issue of Salk vaccine during the coming months with abridged M.R.C, tasting to consist of safety test C and potency test;(b)failing this, to agree that American tested Salk vaccineshould during that period be issued without furtherM.R.C. testing.D.

APPENDIXREPORT BY THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCILLORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCILVaccination against Poliomyelitis1 .        In my minute of 16th April, I informed you that the Ministerof Health had asked for the advice of the Medical Research Council on thesuggestion that, in view of the short-fall in supplies of poliomyelitisvaccine, American Salk vaccine, which had satisfactorily passed safetytests in the U.S.A. , should he issued for use in this country without&quot;being subjected to the additional safety tests carried out &quot;by the medical research Council.This question was considered by my Council at their meeting on18th April and they instructed me to prepare in consultation with two oftheir Members - Professor A. Bradford Hill and Professor A.A. Miles -this minute embodying their views fwr transmission, should you approve,to the Minister of Health.2. In order that my Council might have the latest specialist advice on this matter, and especially on safety and potency tests , I called ameeting of specialists on the morning of 17th April;    and this tendered thefollowing advice:-(a) that Salk vaccine which had passed the American safety testsshould not be issued for use unless it had also passedsatisfactorily the safety tests carried out in this country by the Medical Research Council;(b) that the possibility of using, as a temporary measure forthe period of the present emergency, a shortened form of theBritish safety tests, talcing six weeks instead of the threemonths required by the standard tests, should be enquired into.3. Following this meeting the Council&apos;s Safety Tests Committeemet to consider the suggestion in 2(b) above and the Director of theCouncil&apos;s Biological Standards Division (who is also Secretary of the safety Tests Committee) consulted with his staff who would have theresponsibility of carrying out and certifying the results of any modifiedseries of tests.On the following day the Director of this Division attended theCouncil meeting in order to inform them of the results of these enquiries.These were to the effect that the standard safety tests used in thiscountry together with those carried out by the producer and by theAmerican Government, were minimal requirements;   that shortening of thestandard tests would diminish their value beyond the limits of what wasjustifiable;    and that, even if these preceding considerations did not^Throughout this report, &quot;safety tests&quot; should be understood to meansafety and potency tests.-1-
apply, the practical difficulties in mounting such shortened tests were likely to prevent these being brought to bear in time to reduce significantlythe period when the vaccine supply would be insufficient.4. The Medical Research Council met on 18th April and, after an exhaustive examination of all aspects of the problem, they advised againstissuing Salk vaccine for use in this country unless it had been subjected to, and passed satisfactorily, the present standard safety tests carriedout by the Medical Research Council, in addition to the comparable safetytests carried out by American manufacturers and, in some cases, the testsused at the American National Institutes of Health.The considerations which vreighed with the Medical research council, in reaching this conclusion, follow.5.        Wo vaccine of any kind is devoid of risk;    and the giving of anyparticular vaccine can only be justified when the risks from its use are clearly outweighed by the risks of people remaining unvaccinated.   In theopinion of the Medical Research Cotmcil the balancing of these risks cannotbe viewed in an isolated or narrow context.   Vaccination is a voluntaryact and the number of volunteers - and consequently the number remainingunvaccinated and exposed to the natural disease - is determined by public confidence in the safety of the vaccine.   The effects of a mishap cannot therefore be measured by its immediate and direct results;    to these mustbe added the ravages of the natural disease among persons who, if their confidence had not been shaken, would, in course of time, have come forward for vaccination and thus brought the incidence of the disease to a low level,    Tliis consideration particularly applies when, as in the present instance, the problem is one of a temporary emergency and the question a tissue is whether it is justifiable to take a. risk on safety in order todeal with this.   Further, even wider implications are involved.   To thepublic, vaccination is a process and they do not sharply differentiate between different vaccines.   A disaster with one may, therefore, have repercussions on the acceptance of many.   My Council have felt it only right that th.ey should stress these points before dealing with the presentissue,,   In their opinion, even if the figures relating to the risks involved in vaccination against poliomyelitis were reliable, any attemptto cast up the account simply on this basis would give a picture of the degree of risk that was, not only incomplete, but might be positivelymisleading,6. Assuming a 60 per cent volunteer rate, then according to our information there will be at the end of June 2% million persons, registeredf or vaccination, for v/hom there are no supplies.   Talcing into account theadditional A.,000 litres of Salic vaccine which is now to be purchased, it isestimated that, continuing as at present to put imported Salk vaccinethrough our own safety tests in this country, and further assuming thatall purchased batches are acceptable, the deficit should be wiped out bythe end of September.   The period of deficit would thus be one of threemonths;    the deficit over the third month being one-quarter to one-fifth of that at the end of June.   If instead of the 4,000 litres, 5,00Q litreswere purchased in appropriate sized lots, then on the same assumptions itis estimated that the deficit could be virtually wiped out by the end ofAugust.7.        The incidence of poliomyelitis in this country varies greatlyfrom year to year.   In the worst year that we have experienced since it became prevalent in 1 947* 600 paralytic ca.ses might occur in 2^ millionchildren aged 0-14 years over these three particular months, July to september;   in the best year, 100;   and in an average year, about 300.-2-
SECRE1251The protective value of Salk vaccine is not known with any certainty.   The trial to which it was subjected was carried out before theintroduction of a new production process which might be expected to reduceits strength.   Accepting the figure of approximately 70 per cent given bythe American trial for children aged 6-9 years given two injections, then in a bad year about 400 paralytic cases would be saved over these threemonths in this population of 2-4- million;   seventy cases in a good year;.and 200 in an average year.   These figures are likely to exaggerate the savings in the present situabion, since the&apos;2f- million persons involvedincludes adults (e0g. pregnant women) and also to a large extent, it isbelieved, children aged 5-14 upon whom the incidence is slighter than atyounger ages.   Further, these figures refer to all paralysis, howevermild;    and it should be remembered that three-quarters of the paralyticcases will not be severely or permanently affected.8. In the first month after vaccination, while immunity is developing, cases of poliomyelitis will occur from natural causes.   It isimpossible to exclude in any such individual case whether this has been caused by the vaccine or not.   It is only by the statistics of theirfrequency and nature that any information can be obtained on this point.It is for this reason that a check is kept of cases occurring within amonth of vaccination.   The present problem being concerned v/ith Salkvaccine which has not been subjected to the British tests, the relevantexperience is American.   Unfortunately, it is extremely defective.   It is admitted that the records are seriously incomplete and confidence isfurther shaken by discrepancies in the data.   The only safe conclusion is that the reported incidence of cases is minimal, but we have no   ideaof the real figure.9.        In considering cases following vaccination, it seems justifiable to distinguish those resulting from failure to inactivate   ordinarypoliomyelitis   viruses, and the notorious Cutter outbreak, in regard towhich it is believed that some abnormal alteration occurred in the virusitself.(a) There is no reason to believe that another Cutter incident hasoccurred.   If, therefore, any of the American cases occurring within amonth of vaccination are due to the vaccine they are probably due to thenormal virus and, as such, constitute a continuing risk with this type ofvaccine.   In round figures, something of the order of 200 million doseshave been given in the U.S.A.   Most people have received two doses, manythree;   that is, at least 100 to 70 million Americans have been vaccinated.Up to the end of 1957 &quot;the number of first month cases reported for thethree years since the Gutter incident appears to have beezi 47&apos;l &apos;   Thereis one internal piece of evidence which is disturbing.    It is known that,if active virus is injected, an undue proportion of cases develop paralysisin the injected limb.   The American figures are showing this.The interpretation in view of the defects in the data is not easy but itwould seem reasonable to conclude from the American &quot;surveillance reports&quot;that a disaster like the Cutter incident has not occurred, that some cases are occurring, but that the number, although unknown, is small.(b) The Cutter incident seems to have been in quite a different category;   but it should be remembered that in the Salic vaccine the sametype of virus is still being used and that if it could alter in this wayonce, there is no logical reason why it should not do so again.   Exactinformation on this incident is not easy to come bjr;   but it has been estimated that in Idaho 153 cases were produced per 100,000 injections.We know that modifications of safety testing introduced subsequently would..3.
detect any &quot;batch contaminated to this extent with the Cutter strain, butthat, if we relied on American tests alone, batches could escape detectionwhich were capable of causing in similar circumstances fifteen or so casesper 100,000 injections.   Any means to reduce a risk of this magnitude wouldappear justifiable.The upshot of these considerations is that there is a lurkingfear of a development occurring such as would -give rise to an incident ofthe Cutter type, and a strongly held suspicion that a real but unknownnumber of cases of paralysis are being produced by the ordinary Salkvaccine.10.       The considerations or possible incidences of poliomyelitis inthe population at risk  xxdit. natural infection during the present limitedemergency (paragraph 7) snd. the possible risks from Salic vaccine untestadin this country (paragraph 9) were the nearest approximations that my council felt justified in making on the narrow issue of the immediate situation.   But as is pointed out in paragraph 5 they did not believe thattiiis immediate situation could be divorced from its context and considered in isolation.   Among the other factors which they felt had to be taken intoaccount wore the following:-(a) that the blow to public confidence that would follow evena minor disaster would have wide and long-continuingadverse effects upon the public trust in the medical services of this country;(b) that the public have been given a firm assurance thatany Salk vaccine imported into this country would be subjected to further tests by the Medical research council;    and that it is on the basis of this assurance that this retested Salk vaccine has been widelyrecommended by doctors to their patients;(c) that when the Medical Research Council advised theiiqport of Salk vaccine last summer, this advice was conditional on their being allowed to retest it in thiscountry, in view of the greater risk with this vaccineas compared with the British;(d) that the Medical Research Council had an unblemishedreputation in respect of safety certification in allfields, and that this asset to the country&apos;s ability to promote health measures should be carefully guarded;(e) that, in principle, it was inadvisable that the onlycomplete series of safety tests carried out on a vaccinemight be those done by the producer.Taking all these considerations together my Council agreedunanimously to advise against the issue of Salk vaccine which had not been subjected to their own safety tests in this country.11 .       The present safety tests used by the Medical Research council are three.   In order of importance they are (a) a test of infectivitycarried out on monkeys, (b) &amp; test of antigenic potency similcrly carriedout on monkeys and (c) a tissue culture test for the presence of virusthat has escaped inactivation.   The two former take six weeks to completeif all circumstances are propitious;   the latter, as at present performed.,takes three months.   In reconsidering whether the time taken for thesetests might be shortened, the special committee of 17th April had in mind-4-
to examine the results of running the tissue culture tests for half the time there was never any question of abandoning or modifying the tests onmonkeys.   The reasons put forward to the Council for not modifying the tests&quot;but retaining them unaltered in their present form were as follows: -(i)   No tests which depend upon sampling can given an absoluteguarantee of safety.   The more independent tests the better.The present series of American and British tests on Salkvaccine are the minimal x-equirements for the standard of safety that we have come to expect in this country.(ii)   Safety tests of the vaccine are difficult.   The competenceand skill of our testing team are unsurpassed.   It by nomeans follows that the same test carried out in differentcommercial laboratories would have the same degree ofreliability.(iii)   There are reasons for suspecting that the potency ofcertain batches of Salk vaccine passed in America for issuei3 below our standards.(iv)   Light contamination by active virus is not usually revealedbefore the later stages of the tissue culture tests as nowcarried out.(v)   It would not be possible, for two reasons, to expand theprogramme using monkeys in time to have a significant effecton the present emergency.*    The reasons are:    furthermonkeys would have to be obtained and these require one month to six weeks quarantine before usej    the carrying outof these tests is a highly expert matter, involving treat-ing each monkey individually, and time would be requiredto train the new staff that would need to be recruited.(vi)    The Council&apos;s staff who are responsible for safety testing,having considered the suggestion that the tests might beshortened, have informed us that, from their experience ofcarrying out the tests, they would be reluctant to put their names to any certificates of safety if modified tests were used.These reasons wore considered adequate by my Council forabandoning the suggestion that the present safety tests night be shortened.12.       My Council considered whether there were any means &quot;by which the flow of tested vaccine could be accelerated or the risk to those unprotectedmitigated.   They have the following suggestions to make.13.       The safety tests required are unrelated to the size of the batchof vaccine.   A batch of 500 litres requires just the same tests and requiresjust the same time for testing as a batch of 1,500 litres.   Evidently the flow of vaccine coming out of testing for issue over the summer monthscould be increased if large batches were obtained for early test.*Forty to forty-five monkeys are used in each test.    They cannot be usedagain.   There are no private holdings in this country that could makeany significant contribution to needs on this scale.
14-.       The production of&quot; poliomyelitis vaccine is a tricky process liableto go wrong for little understood reasons.   At some time or other, everyproducer has run into difficulty, which has led to the discarding ofhatches.   It would seem only prudent in the future to order more than isrequired to meet the exact programme envisaged so as to build up a reservepool to guard against a similar emergency to the present occurring againlater in the year.   We are informed that under suitable conditions vaccinecan be stored for a year.   No fear need be entertained that it will not be utilised.   When the programme in this country for the present age-groupsis finished there will be others waiting;    and the question of giving a third injection will have to be considered.15*      At their meeting last Friday, my Council were under a mis-apprehension about the possibility of safety-testing batches already inampoules.   Such vaccine cannot be used for the tissue culture test becausepreservative is added to the vaccine at the time of putting into ampoules,and this impairs the growth of the cells in the tissue culture.   What itwas meant to convey to the Council was that it is known that most, probablyall, a-uiufacturers keep back a considerable sample of each batch of vaccinewithout preservative for the purpose of retesting if necessary.   If purchaseof ampouled vaccine could be made conditional upon an adequate portion ofthis reserve sample being supplied to us here, then testing could continue in the ordinary way.16.       My Council&apos;s last suggestion concerns   the allocation of vaccine.The older the child the more likely he is to have met andsurmounted a natural infection from poliomyelitis and acquired some,although not necessarily a complete, immunity.   In such subjects, even asingle injection of poliomyelitis vaccine would be expected to produce a significant &quot;boost&quot; to the naturally acquired immunity.   Although, therefore,my Council would advise that children under five years of age shouldcontinue to receive two injections of poliomyelitis vaccine, it would seemworthy of consideration that, until supplies are again adequate, childrenover five years of age should receive only one injection.(Signed)   H.P.
