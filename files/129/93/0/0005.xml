Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1958C. (58) 105 Copy No.12th May, 1958CABINETSPECIAL STAMPS : ROBERT BURNSMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Burns Federation and others have for some time been exerting strong pressure on me for a special stamp to mark the bi-centenary of Robert Burns&apos; birth.With the agreement of the Prime Minister I am now seeking the advice of theCabinet.2. The Post Office have from time to time issued stamps commemoratingnational and international events or Royal occasions. It has never issued a stampcommemorating a private person for two reasons.3. First, the Monarch^ head has always been the dominating feature of ourstamps. It is unthinkable that we should put a portrait of a private personalongside that of the Monarch.4. It is true that with a Burns stamp this difficulty could be overcome by having a drawing of his cottage on the stamp. But it would be impossible to find the same kind of solution for all the other people whom we would be pressed tocommemorate. Their heads would have to appear to make the stamps meaningful.Eventually it would be necessary to omit the head of the Monarch.5. This would raise a practical point. We have always been the only country which did not show its name on its stamps. We have been allowed to do this (asthe inventors of postage stamps) because the Monarch&apos;s head has been acceptedthroughout the world as standing for the United Kingdom. If the Monarches headwere omitted from any of our stamps we should almost certainly lose this uniqueposition.6. Second, with the number of famous people there are in our history, any breach in the principle would result in strongly pressed demands for commemoratingother Scots, Welsh, Irish as well as English notabilities. It would quickly become a political issue and I should constantly have to ask the Cabinet to decide whichshould be met and which should be rejected. For all this trouble what should we get? Almost certainly, more unpopularity from the cases which we rejected thanpopularity from the cases we accepted. The American Administration, who issueabout twelve special stamps a year, had on their hands in 1956 over 2,000 demands for special stamps; they have had to set up a special department to deal with themand have found it a very controversial and thankless task.7. There are most formidable objections to issuing a stamp commemoratinga person, however strong the pressure. But is there, in fact, a widespread demandfor a Burns stamp? Although the Burns Federation and their supporters have setup a great clamour, I am pretty sure they do not represent the general body of scottish opinion. The silence of better-known Scottish personalities in parliament and out of it is significant.53435THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
&apos;&apos; Is.&apos; The body whose province it is to advise me on this subject is the Post OfficeAdvisory Council, and they did in fact review stamp policy in 1955. They stronglyadvocated that there should be no change of policy and were especially emphaticthat there should be no special stamps commemorating individuals.9. Since 1955 Post Office Ministers have given careful consideration to aBurns stamp. It has been refused by my predecessor and myself, both in the house and in correspondence. These refusals have been widely publicised.10. In short, Burns may mean very much to some Scots. But I am strongly infavour of maintaining our present policy.E. M.General Post Office, E.C. 1,9th May, 1958.
