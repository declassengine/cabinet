ICELANDIC FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Attorney-general in the light of a meeting with officials of the Foreign Office,Scottish Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Admiralty, I think itdesirable that I should submit to the Cabinet for their consideration,the lines on which it was felt instructions to the Captain of the FishervProtection Squadron and to the skippers of fishing vessels should be drafted.2. The instructions to the Captain of the Fishery Protection Squadron,should be on the following lines:-(a) The use of force should if possible be avoided.(b) Force should only be used to prevent the arrest or to secure therelease of a British fishing vessel after force has been used by theIcelanders either in boarding a vessel or otherwise.(c) No more force should be used than is necessary to prevent the arrest or to secure the release of a British fishing vessel.(d) If a British vessel has been boarded by   Icelanders and soarrested, H.M. ship should in turn seek to board the fishing vessel andto release her, and if a tow rope has been attached, detach the tow rope.&quot;(e)     If an Icelandic boarding party seeks to take in a British vesselunder its own power and it is not possible for H.M. ship to board her,the British vessel should be ordered to heave to and if necessary a warning shot may be fired across her bows.(f) If a British vessel is being towed and it is not possibleto board her, the towing vessel may be ordered to  heave toand if necessary a warning shot may be fired across her.bows.If this is ignored, warning should be given of the intention to fire withlive ammunition at the towing vessel to secure the release of the arrestedvessel.(g) Since Thor is understood to be the only Icelandic vessel capableof taking trawlers in tow, she should be shadowed closely in order toprevent her making arrests.-1-C.(58) 112 COPY NO.^- &apos; 21st May, 1958CABINET
(h) Save in the circumstances mentioned in (f) above, no shots areto be fired at any Icelandic vessel unless it is clear that the vesselis firing live ammunition at a British fishing vessel or one ofH.M. ships.(i) In boarding operations firearms should not be used unless theIcelanders use them first.(j)     Each incident is to be treated separately and on its own meritsfor the purposes of these instructions.   The fact that an Icelandicvessel may have fired on one trawler is not to be considered ajustification for firing first against that vessel in a subequent incident.3.      The instructions to skippers should be to conform to the directions of K.M. ships, to ignore all Icelandic instructions,:and to seek to avoid or delay the arrest of their vessels.   Skippers shouldnot however flee from the Icelandic vessel but should notify H.M. shipsdirectly one appears in the vicinity.   On no account should skippersallow their crews to use weapons of any kind against the Icelanders in seeking to avoid arrest.R.E.M.-B,Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C.2.20th May, 1958-2-
