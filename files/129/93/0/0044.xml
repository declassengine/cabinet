C.(58) 144 COPY NO.9th July, 1958CABINETEGYPT:   FINANCIAL negotiations memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet invited me to circulate the detailed provisions of thedraft agreement,drawn up on the basis of a lump sum settlement, to becommunicated to the Egyptian Government (C.C.(58) 51st Conclusions,Minute 4).    This is attached (Appendix).2.      My comments on the several clauses are as follows.3.      Preamble.    While references to the &quot;United Arab Republic&quot;throughout are inevitable if this Agreement is to be acceptable to thepresent regime, I am advised that the use of this term in the draft doesnot constitute formal recognition by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.4.     Article I and Annex A.    These are concerned with definitions.5.     Article II requires Her Majesty&apos;s Government to remove theirpresent restrictions on Egyptian Accounts so soon as Egypt annuls itsdiscriminatory measures against British persons and property and paysover the lump sum in compensation (see Article III).6.     Article III requires Egypt:-(l)      (a) to terminate its discriminatory measures against british nationals and property;(b) to return British property in accordance with the procedurelaid down in Annex B.     (It may be necessary to acceptsequestration charges at the present rate of10 per cent);(c) to restore industrial property, e.g. , trade-marks,patents and copyright, in respect of which detailed provisions are set out in Annex C;(2) to pay over a lump sum of  x millions (the precise amount being left to subsequent negotiation) in full and final settlement of thefollowing claim s:-(a)  those in respect of Egyptianised property.    (The last five lines are designed to cover the special case ofBritish interests in a nationalised Egyptian firmwhich was the wholly or partly owned subsidiaryof a British firm or nationaL,e. g. , Imperial chemical industries (Egypt) Limited. );-l-Q SECRET *&quot;&quot;fa(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
(b)  those in respect of damage to sequestrated property,other than where this is occasioned by tax settle-ments made by the Egyptian sequestrator on behalfof the British owner.    Two points are worth notingon this clause:-(i)  no attempt is made to define what constitutes&quot;damage&quot; except to the extent that it must&quot;result from the measures&quot; taken by Egyptagainst British property and United kingdom nationals.    It follows, therefore, that pre-Suezclaims, e. g. , in respect of pensions(Article  r(a)), or those of the officialsdismissed in 1951 (Article V(b)) are not covered by the lump sum.    A fortiori other claims by United Kingdom nationals, what-ever these may be, e.g. , commercial debts,are excluded.    But, while Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment retain complete freedom to decide what should be included or excluded, when theterms of reference of the Foreign Compensa-tion Commission are drawn up, we do not want to compound in the Agreement for claims which are quite unconnected with Suez;(ii) the lump sum covers only &quot;damage&quot; occurringbetween 3 0th October, 1956, and the date onwhich an agreement is signed.    This is toavoid giving the Egyptians an obvious incentive to administer sequestrated propertyirresponsibly between the date of the agree-ment and the date on which the owner or hisagent can resume possession.    As theAgreement stands, any claims in respect of damage during this period would lie against egypt as breaches of Annex B(2) which requires the United Arab Republic to&quot;protect ^/&quot;British/ property until it isreturned to the owners&quot;.    I recognise thatit may be very difficult to pursue suchclaims against Egypt, and in practice very-difficult to determine when damage actuallytook place.    It may therefore be appropriate to adopt a less restrictive definition in framing the terms of reference of the foreign compensation Commission.7.     Article IV.    This covers the rights of British citizens to transfer the proceeds of selling their property in Egypt.    From previousdiscussions with the Egyptians it is clear that they will only agree toautomatic transfers of up to  5,000 in each case (which would whollycover 75 per cent of the private claims lodged with the Foreign Office),and that further transfers would be, as with the nationals of othercountries, at the discretion of the Egyptian Exchange Control authoritiesThere are also provisions covering:--2-
(a) the transfer from Egypt of jewellery and personaleffects, in respect of which the Egyptians, in their negotiations with the French, have sought to imposelimits of  1,000 and  50 respectively;(b) the authorisation of pre-zero capital transfers, i. e. ,those for which application was made before27th July, 1950;(c) exchange rates, the purpose of which is to protectapplicants from the effect of a devaluation of theEgyptian poun.; subsequent to the application for thetransfer.    The Egyptians are however likely tomake difficulties about this provision.8.     Article V.    This deals with a number of miscellaneous points,including payments which would not be compounded for in the lump sum, viz. -(a) pensions, on which I understand some arrears are nowbeing paid;(b) compensation for the British officials dismissed in1951;(c) the release to the beneficial owners of securitiesbelonging to United Kingdom nationals held to theorder of Banks in Egypt;It also covers -(d) the restoration of time-barred rights at law;(e) the right to re-open tax claims settled by theEgyptian authorities.9.     Articles VI and Annex D deal with the resumption of normal commercial relations.    This has not so far been discussed in any detail with the Egyptians, who may press for provisions which are less detailed and specific.    The present draft is designed broadly:-(a) to put British traders in the same position, by comparison with traders of other countries, as theywould have been, had they not been subjected to special restrictions;(b) to prevent, so far as possible, discrimination againstthe use of sterling in trade with Egypt;(c) to restore the pre-Suez position as regards commercial relations generally, including shipping, civil aircraft(which involve reciprocal obligations on her majesty&apos;s Government) and shipping agencies.10.    Article VII provides for reciprocal obligations in respect of entryand exit.    There is also a provision, specifically needed on account ofa lump sum agreement, for Egypt to supply Her Majesty&apos;s Government-3-
and British nationals with facilities and information in connection with british claims.11.     Article VIII provides for the termination of the Sterling ReleasesAgreements as soon as the whole of the No. 2 Account has been released to Egypt.   This date could not be later than 1st January, 1959.   In theordinary course, in this event, the Agreements could be regarded as spent.But, since originally it was contemplated that they would run until 1st January, 1963, and one contains an awkward provision requiring her majesty&apos;s Government in effect to provide Egypt with dollars up to 11 millions a year for the purchase of petroleum products, it is desirableto provide specifically for the termination of the Agreements.   This pointhas not yet been put to the Egyptians.12.    Article IX deals with the entry into force of the Agreement.Conclusion13.    This draft differs from that already given to the Egyptians in two main respects:-(a) the provisions relating to the payment of a lump sum -Articles III and VII(2);(b) other provisions which have been inserted to meet Egyptiancomments on the earlier draft or to clarify its intent.In the previous negotiations, the Egyptians objected toassuming obligations in respect of &quot;rights and interests&quot;other than in property and asked us to specify what these were.   The result has involved extensive additions to theearlier draft, notably to cover:-- (i)  a detailed definition of rights and interests in industrial property --Article IIl(l)(c) and Annex C;(ii)  time-barred rights at law - Article V(d);(iii)  tax claims - Article V(e).It cannot therefore be assumed that the Egyptians wouldbe willing to accept these additions.14.    The draft does not deal with two points that will ultimately have tobe included:-(a)  Shell. It is essential that Shell should negotiate a separate andprior agreement with the Egyptians.   Shell have left a draft agreement with them and await their reactions.   It wouldbe necessary to include some reference to Shell&apos;s agreementeither in the Agreement between Governments or in a letterannexed to it.-4-
(b)   Egyptian waiver of war claims.   In his talks withMr. Hamilton of the Bank of England, Dr. Emary, theGovernor of the National Bank of Egypt, said that,provided some way could be found of meeting Egyptiandemands, e.g. by a lump sum settlement, Egypt wouldbe prepared to sign a letter waiving her war damageclaims, possibly by offsetting them against the Base.It is however difficult, and probably unwise, to deal withthis aspect, until agreement has been reached on theamount of a lump sum.15.   With my approval, and the agreement of the Foreign Secretary, theTreasury representative has already informed Dr. Emary that he wouldbe prepared to meet him informally at Geneva on lZth July (whenDr. Emary will be there to sign the agreement with the Suez canal company) in order to hand over the text of the United Kingdom draft andto discuss arrangements for the resumption of talks.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.9th July, 1958
