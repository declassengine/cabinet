Printed for the Cabinet. June 1958C. (58) 129 Copy No.20th June, 1958CABINETCOMMONWEALTH immigrants memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Cabinet decided in July last year that at that time legislation to control immigration from the Commonwealth would be premature but that the position should continue to be kept under review (C.C. (57) 57th Conclusions, Minute 5).The Ministerial Committee have kept a close watch on developments since then,and I now submit this report on their behalf because I presided over their last meeting in the Lord Chancellor^ absence.Situation report. Annex A contains figures on the rate of immigration from the West Indies,India and Pakistan and of coloured immigration generally during 1957 and in thefirst five months of 1958. By the end of last year the total coloured population in Great Britain was believed to be of the order of 180,000, an increase of some40,000 over the previous year. During 1957 the number of West Indians in thiscountry increased by about 23,000-about 6,000 less than the rate of increase in1956; but during the first quarter of 1958 the increase of West Indians was about,100, nearly a thousand more than in the first quarter of 1957, and this higher rate was maintained during April and May. The increase of Indians and Pakistanisduring 1957 was about 12,000, compared with only about 7,600 in 1956. Thissteep climb brought the rate of increase of these immigrants by February 1958 tothe disquieting level of 3,500 for that month alone (L934 Pakistanis, 1,588 Indians),suggesting an organised flow and widespread evasion of the controls exercised bythe Indian and Pakistan Governments. Representations made to these governments to tighten their controls have met with a willing response, and partlyno doubt as a result of the measures taken by them (summarised at Annex B) thelatest figures for India and Pakistan show a steep drop, to some 700 from both countries in April and 900 in May. To sum up, West Indian immigration appearsto be continuing at a substantially heavier rate than last year, although still belowthe 1956 rate; immigration from India and Pakistan, which gave cause for concernearlier in the year, seems now to have been effectively discouraged.3. If further immigration were to continue at the level reached at thebeginning of this year, there would seem to be little alternative to proceeding as amatter of urgency with legislation to restrict it. The immigrants from India and pakistan particularly are often unskilled and illiterate and unable to speak English;many of them live in dirty and overcrowded conditions; and the health of some of1them gives cause for concern. They find employment less easily than do the WestIndians: between September 1957 and March 1958, unemployment among the indians and Pakistanis increased nearly fourfold, from 1,500 to 5,800 reflectingshorter time working, for example, in the woollen industry. Social difficulties so farinvolving the coloured population generally (but most acutely the West Indians,because they are the most numerous), have emerged in some areas for example,in parts of north-west London, and in Brixton and Birmingham, where largenumbers of coloured immigrants have congregated. Property has been bought upby coloured landlords, who have then made the position of white tenants intolerable,SECRET53610 b
21$and entire streets have gone over to a coloured population. Further information about the social and economic problems arising from coloured immigration isgiven at Annex C.4. However, public opinion generally does not appear yet to be seriouslyconcerned by the problem; legislation to curb coloured immigration from theCommonwealth would clearly be contentious and, if the rate of immigration canbe held back by administrative measures and also by appropriate publicity in thecountries concerned, we do not think that early legislation would be justified. Butwe think it important to ensure that these administrative measures are effectivelycontinued, and the possibility of improving the-existing administrative controls onemigrants from the West Indies, as well as from India and Pakistan, should beenergetically explored. The Commonwealth Secretary has undertaken to look intothe question of arranging for a health check to be imposed on emigrants from indian and Pakistan. It will, however, be necessary to keep the general situation under constant review since the need for legislation may arise at any time. AnImmigration Bill has already been given a place in the list of contingent Bills inthe future legislative programme (List A.2 annexed to C. (58) 68).5. Meanwhile, in order that the difficulties of proceeding with legislation maybe more accurately assessed, we think it would be helpful for opinion among government supporters in Parliament to be sounded. We would also see advantage in steps being taken to inform our back-benchers more fully of the difficulties involved in the problem.The Form of legislation. At their last discussion the Cabinet endorsed our conclusion that if controlof Colonial immigration were to be introduced reliance should be placed on themethod provided for in the draft Bill submitted to the Cabinet in September 1955.This Bill, a revised draft of which is attached at Annex D, would enable provision to be made by Order in Council for prohibiting the entry into the United Kingdomof British subjects coming from the Commonwealth for other than temporaryvisits, unless suitable housing accommodation were available for them, and theyeither came for authorised employment or were able to support themselves. We havere-examined this Bill and are in general satisfied that, subject to the reservationsnoted in paragraph 7 below, and to a few points of detail which v/e wish to consider further, a Bill on these lines would provide suitable powers of control overimmigration from the Commonwealth.7. Decisions are required on two points before legislation on the lines ofthe annexed Bill can be finalised:  (a) Should the Bill itself cover the Commonwealth generally or should it be confined to those countries from which the bulk of coloured immigrantsnow come? As at present drafted the Bill applies to all immigrants from Commonwealth countries (including the Colonies), anydiscrimination between one Commonwealth country and another being left to the subsequent stage of Orders in Council made under the Bill.The majority of the Committee favoured a general Bill in that it would place less emphasis upon considerations of colour. These would however emerge at the Order in Council stage, and there might bepresentational difficulties with the old Commonwealth countries overa general Bill.The position of the Colonial Secretary has on the other hand been reserved on the ground that because Her Majesty&apos;s Government are directly responsible for the wellbeing of the Colonial territories and people it is not necessarily appropriate to deal with the Colonies inthe same way as other Commonwealth countries.The Commonwealth Secretary thinks that in view of thesympathetic attitude of the Indian and Pakistan Governments towards our representations, it might be possible and advantageous to secure their acquiescence in a Bill limited to controlling immigrationspecifically from those countries. He is exploring this possibilityfurther. It would, of course, be a good defence against criticism ofthe Bill as a colour-bar measure if we could say that the Governmentsof India and Pakistan acquiesced in it. The general feeling in theCommittee was, however, that it would be impracticable to proceed with
such a limited measure, since Parliamentary and public opinion would naturally expect any measure dealing with coloured immigration tocover immigrants from the West Indies, who are the most numerousand in the forefront of public attention.(b) Should the Bill extend to the Irish Republic? As now drafted, it doesnot apply to citizens of the Republic ordinarily resident in the british isles. We are satisfied that it would be impracticable to control immigration generally from the Irish Republic, for the reasons set out at some length in paragraph 4 of CP. (56) 263 (reproduced in Annex E),which emphasised the great practical difficulties in the way of includingimmigration from Ireland within the Bill (it would involve among other things the imposition of expensive and irksome control over alltravellers at the Irish ports, including travellers from Northern Ireland).Unauthorised immigration of a few coloured people through the irish republic could be ignored, but large-scale evasion might necessitateplacing special controls on the ports of entry from Ireland to deal withcoloured immigrants only (paragraph 6 of CP. (56) 263 reproduced in Annex E).The Committee was, however, divided on the question how asa matter of form immigrants from the Irish Republic should be dealtwith in the Bill. Citizens of the Irish Republic could be dealt with either as British subjects from overseas (potentially liable to control under the Bill) or as British subjects belonging to the United Kingdom(firmly inside our fence from the beginning). If we formally includedthem in the same category as British subjects from overseas, we wouldhave no intention of making an Order in Council applicable to them,but some members of the Committee thought that this reserve powermight enable more effective arrangements to be made, if necessary,with the authorities in the Republic for controlling commonwealth immigration into the United Kingdom through that country. there might also be some presentational advantage in regard to theCommonwealth. On the other hand, it would still be necessary to declare on Second Reading that there was no intention of controllingcitizens of the Irish Republic travelling to and from that country. Toprovide in the Bill for Irish Republican citizens to be treated as british subjects belonging to the United Kingdom would make it clear from the outset that no control was going to be placed on immigration from the Republic, and the Bill would have the merit of reflecting theactual position.8. Unless we find it necessary to introduce legislation at short notice, there might be some advantage in preparing a more comprehensive Bill to deal withimmigration generally. This would make permanent the statutory provision forthe control of aliens, which has had to be continued annually in the expiring laws Continuance Bill since 1919. Besides avoiding the incongruity of legislatingon a permanent basis for the control of Commonwealth immigration while leaving the aliens controls on a temporary footing, such a measure might render lessobtrusive the discriminatory intention of the Commonwealth provisions. It seemsworth investigating whether the deportation provisions (Clause 1 (1) (c) of thedraft Bill) would appear less objectionable in a comprehensive Immigration Bill;and whether such a Bill might provide a suitable opportunity for amending theBritish Nationality Act, 1948, which in its present form would enable citizens of many of the self-governing Commonwealth countries (including India and pakistan) who came to live in the United Kingdom to avoid deportation underthe draft Bill by registering as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies afterresiding here for one year only. We have not ourselves gone into the question ofa comprehensive Bill in any detail because the issues raised would be outsideour terms of reference, but we recommend that officials should be instructed toconsider without delay the problems involved in such a Bill, with a view to making an early submission of proposals to the Home Affairs Committee.9.   We therefore invite the Cabinet to agree:  (i) That legislation is not needed at the moment.(ii) That we should do what we can to ensure that the steps taken by theGovernments of India and Pakistan to restrict immigration from thosecountries are effectively continued.53610
(iii) That the possibility of extending the administrative controls now in force,including those in the West Indies, should be urgently examined.(iv) That the opinion of our supporters in Parliament should be sounded; and steps taken more fully to inform them of the difficulties of the problem.(v) That the Committee should continue to keep developments under review,and should report again in the early autumn, before the legislative programme for next session is finalised,(vi) That  officials  should   meantime  study  urgently   the   possibility   of comprehensive immigration legislation.10.   We also invite the Cabinet to decide:  (i) Whether, if a Bill confined to Commonwealth immigration is preferred toa comprehensive Immigration Bill, it should cover:  (a) the whole of the Commonwealth, including the Colonies; orlb) only   those   Commonwealth   countries   (including   Colonies)responsible for the bulk of coloured immigration, e.g., India,Pakistan and the West Indies; or(c) all the independent members of the Commonwealth, and themalone; or,(d) subject to the results of the enquiries the Commonwealth secretary is now making, India and Pakistan only.(ii) Whether, in the context of a &quot; short&quot; Bill, cituens of the Irish Republicshould be treated as British subjects from overseas or as British subjectsbelonging to the United Kingdom.HAILSHAM.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,18th June, 1958.

Annex CRECENT INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC problems arising FROM COLOURED IMMIGRATIONEmployment and National AssistanceA count taken by the Ministry of Labour of the number of coloured workersregistered for employment during the third week of March showed that since theAutumn the number of unemployed had doubled, the total number registeredbeing 15,000 compared with 7,500 last September. The increase was most markedamongst the Indians and Pakistanis who in the main would be suitable for employment only in unskilled jobs of the lowest grade in industries which are not now appreciably undermanned. They are more difficult to place in employmentthan West Indians and are greatly handicapped by their unfamiliarity with the language and their lack of any kind of skill. Whereas the total of unemploymentamongst the West Indians increased between September and March by 40 per cent,from 4,600 to 6,400, the number of unemployed Indians and Pakistanis increasedalmost four-fold from 1,500 to 5,800, including at least 3,400 Pakistanis.2. The coloured applicants for National Assistance who were not receiving umemployment benefit totalled 7,100 in March compared with 1,900 last September.The March figure included 4,100 Indians and Pakistanis, an increase of 3,600 overSeptember. Of the 4,100 at least 2,500 were Pakistanis. There was a marked increase in the number of West Indian applicants for National Assistance who werenot receiving unemployment benefit; these totalled 2,000 compared with 900 inSeptember. In addition to the recipients of National Assistance referred to above,5,500 coloured people were receiving unemployment benefit in March, supplementedin 1,100 cases by National Assistance. Of the 5,500, 2,800 were West Indians and1,400 Indians and Pakistanis.Health3. An investigation undertaken in September into the number of cases ofpulmonary tuberculosis amongst temporary residents who had arrived in thiscountry during the preceding twelve months revealed that whilst the total numberof such patients in sanitoria and chest hospitals was small, it included adisproportionately high number of Indians and Pakistanis.Housing4. Housing is the most serious problem at present arising from colouredimmigration and the situation in the affected areas is acute. During a Debate onthe Adjournment on 22nd November, 1957, five Members of Parliamentrepresenting London constituencies referred to the overcrowded conditions in whichthe immigrants live and to the growing resentment by white residents who are the victims of annoyance by coloured landlords anxious to secure their removal. Localauthorities can offer no solution; they have insufficient resources to deal with theproblem quickly and if they were able to do so there would inevitably be protestsagainst the coloured immigrants being given preference in the housing lists. Manyimmigrants are accustomed to living in squalid conditions and have no desire toimprove their surroundings.

CONFIDENTIALCommonwealth ImmigrantsDRAFTOF ABILLTo enable Her Majesty to provide for restricting the immigration of certain british subjects, British protected persons and citizens of the Republic of Ireland,and for the deportation of such subjects,persons and citizens in certain cases;and for purposes connected with thematters aforesaid.CCXXXVIII K (4)28th October, 1955(Reprinted 6th June, 1958)105-2(37606)
Annex EParagraphs 4 and 6 of CP. (56) 2634. There are the following practical arguments for continuing this state ofaffairs:  (a) Passenger traffic between Ireland and Great Britain is very heavy estimated at 1 million passengers annually in each direction.(b) Control over such a large volume of traffic would lead to delay at the ports and consequent annoyance to our own travellers, both business and private. Even during the war control was felt by many to be intolerable.(c) As it would be very difficult indeed effectively to supervise movementacross the land border between the Irish Republic and NorthernIreland, the control of sea traffic would have to extend in practice tomovement to and from Ireland as a whole. This would be offensive to the sentiments of the patriotic and loyalist majority of the populationof Northern Ireland, who would have to be required to carry documents of identity.(d) Any form of control must be expected to have some hampering effect onthe ready flow of Irish labour (both from the Republic and from northern Ireland) which has long been a valuable source of manpowerto industries and services in Great Britain and is likely to remain so aslong as our demands for manpower remain so high as they are atpresent.(e) Additional staff, estimated at thirty Immigration Officers at a salary costof  25,000 a year, would be required at the ports, and correspondinglymore staff in the Home Office.(/) It would, of course, be necessary to seek legislative powers (by revisingappropriately the Bill at present in draft) if it were decided to bringresidents in the Irish Republic within the scope of any control whichmight be imposed over the entry of Commonwealth citizens into thiscountry, and it is a matter of political judgment whether, given thespecial circumstances of the Irish Republic, the scope of possiblecontroversy over the Bill would be widened or reduced by such adecision.6. There is, however, one further point that arises out of the freedom of movement now enjoyed by Irish Republican citizens in relation to the possible need to impose control over the entry of coloured people. There is a possibility thatcoloured immigrants might try to evade the control by travelling first to the irish republic in transit to this country. As regards alien immigration the irish republican authorities co-operate in advising us of aliens arriving in the Republicen route for the United Kingdom. Whether they would be willing to take the freshpowers that would undoubtedly be required to enable them to extend thiscollaboration to cover the cases of immigrants in transit from commonwealth countries, is a matter of speculation. If only a few individual coloured immigrantsgained access to the United Kingdom in this manner, the existence of this loopholecould be neglected, since the primary object of the Bill which has been drafted isto restrict or prevent immigration in the mass. If, however, this loophole were tobe used to evade the control on a large scale preventive action would need to betaken. The arguments against imposing full control over Irish traffic have alreadybeen pointed out in paragraph 4 above, and it would therefore be necessary toconsider putting on at the ports of entry from Ireland an immigration controlapplied solely to coloured people.53610c
