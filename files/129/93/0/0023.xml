Printed for the Cabinet. June 1958C. (58) 123 Copy No.  5 716th June, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy seal at their last discussion on pensions the Cabinet agreed that, before they could reach a final decision on the respective merits of the August and September Plans,it would be desirable to take confidential soundings of certain interests which wouldbe affected if either of these Plans was put into effect (C.C. (58) 29th Conclusions,Minute 2). I am circulating separately, as C. (58) 124, a complete record of the organisations consulted, the working document with which they were supplied (inwhich the August and September Plans are described as Scheme B and Scheme Arespectively) and their reactions to that document. For convenience, I attach, asthe Annex to this memorandum, a summary of the full record.2. The Ministerial Committee on Pensions, under my chairmanship, have reviewed the situation in the light of the results of these consultations. They wishme, in submitting the main problem afresh to the Cabinet, to emphasise three main points:  A. The Scope of the Consultations3.   The consultations were limited in several respects:  (a) Their scope was limited to the British Employers Confederation and26 selected private employers (but not the National Farmers&apos; union or the Co-operative movement); the Trades Union Congress; the chairmen of the Nationalised Industries (but not local government).(b) They were confined to an attempt to establish how far, in the case of the september scheme, employees would be likely to be contracted out and how far it would be necessary and feasible, both under the August schemeand under the September scheme where employees were not contracted out, to adapt occupational schemes. In other respects the workingdocument provided only an outline of the two schemes; in particular, ifcontained no detailed or comprehensive indication of the rates of contribution and benefit entailed by either scheme.(c) Nor did the. working document disclose the Exchequer^ interest in thisquestion and the connection between the finances of the two Plans andthe emerging deficit on the National Insurance Fund.4. We must bear the above points in mind in assessing the weight to be attachedto the opinions expressed in the consultations.B. The Result of the Consultations5.   Certain points emerge fairly clearly:  (a) There is some doubt among employers whether our present economic circumstances constitute the right, occasion for any extension of theexisting National Insurance arrangements.53585SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
C -The Next Step6.   Four possible courses of action now appear to be open to us:  (a) We can abandon the whole project of a graduated pensions scheme.(b) We can seek to reach a decision as between the August and SeptemberPlans in the very near future and proceed to give legislative effect to thatdecision as early as possible next session.(c) We can publish a White Paper describing our policy in general terms anddefining the issues to be resolved, with the intention of legislating next session if this proves to be feasible. Given the length of time whichit would take to obtain any informed and constructive public reaction,this course would make it necessary for the White Paper to be published in the very near future, preferably before the summer recess; and itwould make it unlikely that we should be able to introduce a Bill untilthe early months of next year in which case we might be hard put toit to get the Bill on to the Statute Book before the end of the session.(d) We can defer publication of the White Paper until the autumn (whichwould allow more time for its drafting), in the knowledge that we should then in effect be abandoning any hope of legislating next session andshould probably need to be content to outline our intentions in our election Address.7. After considering these four courses the Ministerial Committee are agreedthat: -(i) It is out of the question for the Government to take no further action.Even if unemployment becomes no worse, the deficit on the national insurance Fund will be greater in 1959 than in the current year; and the implications for the 1959 Budget, if the Government were seen to betaking no steps to remedy this situation, are clear.(ii) The ideal solution would be a Cabinet decision in the very near future onthe rival merits of the August and September Plans, followed by legislation at the beginning of the next session. (This course wouldnot preclude publication of a White Paper, either simultaneously with,or possibly in advance of, the Bill. But such a White Paper would be purely explanatory of the Governments decision; it would not be designed to test the reaction of the public to a hypothetical Plan.) It isfor the Cabinet to judge whether they feel able to agree on such adecision in the next few weeks.(iii) If an immediate decision proves to be impossible, the best course wouldbe to publish a White Paper designed to elicit a more informed public reaction to a possible plan than we have so far succeeded in obtaining.On this assumption the timetable implied in course (c) is preferable tothat implied in course (d), mainly because the latter would have theundesirable result that a matter of national importance would become the subject of Party political controversy and the governments proposals would be discussed, in competition with the plan published bythe Opposition, in the atmosphere of an impending General Election.(b) Several employers emphasise that the complex issues raised by both Plansneed to be publicly discussed in much greater detail before it will bepossible to reach any sensible decision.(c) There is no great welcome for either Plan; and although each has itssupporters, neither has been enthusiastically received. There is nodecisive majority in favour of the principle of contracting out in theprivate sector; among those firms who favour that principle thereare some significant concerns who have said that they would not themselves wish to take advantage of it. Equally some who. prefer the August Plan would like it to include contracting out (which isimpossible).(d) There is a strong preponderance of view that the adoption of either plan would involve substantial modification of occupational schemes.(e) The Trades Union Congress want contracting out but would prefer iton an individual basis; we feel that the latter cannot be conceded.
(iv) If we adopt course (c), the following points arise:  (a) Should the White Paper discuss both the August and the SeptemberPlans or should it be confined to only one of these? And, if so,to which one? The Ministerial Committee feel, with somereservation on the part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that a white Paper dealing with both Plans would imply weakness andindecision on the part of the Government, and would confuse,rather than clarify, the issue. But it would be possible, andpreferable from the point of view of the Chancellor of theExchequer, to include a description of both Plans in the white paper and to indicate that, if a preponderant demand for contracting out could be established, the Government would introduce the September Plan but that, in the absence of any suchdemand, they would regard the August Plan as the simpler andmore effective course.(b) Whether the White Paper deals with both Plans or with only one ofthem, it will need to contain a full description of the governments proposals, particularly as regards the level of contributions and benefits involved; it will need to relate those proposals to therequirements of the Exchequer in the context of the emergingdeficit on the National Insurance scheme; and it will need to incorporate any detailed amendment of the proposals which appears desirable in the light of the results of the recentconsultations, e.g., an amendment of the interest rate assumed forthe purposes of the September Plan. Before committing ourselves to course (c), therefore, we need to be assured that it will be physically possible to produce a White Paper on these lines in thevery near future as will be essential if we are to have any hopeof legislating next Session.8. In fact in summarising this complex matter for the benefit of the cabinet it must be stated frankly that, if we plump for a White Paper, we must take aline. If we take a line it appears inevitable that we must decide either pro or conputting forward any scheme in which contracting out is a feature. On this we need advice from the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether any scheme includingcontracting out will meet the Exchequer problem. Then, having decided thatwe are dealing with the financial aspect soundly and for the long term, we mustopt for a scheme which offers good value and is politically tolerable if not alluring.R. A.

annex summary OF THE RESPONSE TO CONSULTATION on alternative LINES OF policy . (58) 124 consists of the following documents:  Appendix I. The Working Document which was supplied to the interestsconsulted.Appendix II. The replies from the British Employers&apos; Confederation and26 Chairmen of large and medium-sized firms.Appendix III. The replies from the nationalised industries.Appendix IV. The views of the Ministers responsible for the Public Services.Appendix  V. The replies from organisations concerned with pensions schemes.Appendix VI. The comments of the Trades Union Congress.Appendix I. The Working Document2. Those consulted were asked to answer certain questions and were given anopportunity to comment on the brief outlines of Scheme A (September Plan) andScheme B (August Plan) given in the Working Document. They were particularly asked to indicate whether they would wish to contract out from Scheme A, but were not specifically asked to express a preference between the two schemes,although some have done so. They were also asked to indicate what adaptation oftheir occupational schemes might be necessary, in order to avoid the contributions and pensions under a combination of the national and occupational schemes beingexcessive; and to indicate the nature and likely extent of consultation withemployees which would be required if changes were to be made in existingoccupational schemes.Appendix II. Private Industry(a) Contracting Out3. A distinction has to be drawn between views on the principle ol contracting out and expressions of intention if contracting out were permitted. On the former,only 7 of the 26 replies express themselves definitely for or against the principle of contracting out 5 (viz., Imperial Tobacco, Churchills, Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, Colvilles,and Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson) in favour and Bristol aeroplane company and Unilevers against.4. On the question of intention to contract out if it were permitted, 4 of theabove 5 (i.e., all except Churchills) and H other private employers (Midland Bank,LCI., Vickers, English Electric, Shaw Savill, Pilkingtons, Guinness and Jeyes) have said that they would probably or certainly contract out in respect of some or all of their occupational schemes. Eleven private employers (viz., Churchills, bristol aeroplane Company, Unilever, A.E.I., Cleggs, Sainsburys, Fords, John LewisPartnership, Courtaulds, Shell and Caffyns) have said that they would probably orcertainly not contract out. The remaining three (viz., James Longley, Beaver and company and Moss Bros.) are uncertain.5. The reply from the British Employers&apos; Confederation expresses the viewthat an option to contract out should be available even although they think it wouldnot be widely exercised.Unilever (iv) and Sainsburys (x) recall that when the United States scheme wasbeing introduced serious consideration was given to the question of allowingemployers to contract out, but that it was decided that it would be unworkable.(b) Preference6. Where a preference has been expressed, 6 firms have favoured Scheme Aand 11 Scheme B. A number of these preferences are expressed as &quot; on balance &quot;and in the main relate to aspects of the Schemes other than contracting out. Severalfirms, in expressing a preference for Scheme B, suggest that it should be modified(o include the option to contract out.
(c) Consultation7. The interest of many of the firms consulted has now been aroused. Onlya minority appear hitherto to have given this question much consideration. Thereis therefore a strong demand for further consultation and &quot; public discussion &quot;before a decision is taken (e.g., LCI. (v), Stewarts &amp; Lloyds (xi), Longleys (xxii)).Several replies specifically mention the desirability of a White Paper (e.g.,B.E.C. (i), Imperial Tobacco (vi), Churchill Machine Tools (vii) and bristol aeroplane Company (xvi)).(d) Finance8. Several replies doubt the attractiveness of Scheme A while the upper tieris based on the assumption of a 3 per cent, interest rate. Many occupational schemes are earning a bigger return (e.g., LCI. (v) show that their scheme is earning5 per cent., Pilkington (xvii) 4 per cent., and Colvilles (xix) claim to be able toproduce comparable benefits on a contribution of approximately half the 8s.required by the Government scheme). Some firms appear to take the view thatthe schemes would represent an expensive advance in social service legislation.(e) Occupational Schemes9. There is a fairly widely expressed fear among those with well-establishedschemes that an improved State scheme would adversely affect the private sector(e.g., Fords (xi), Bristol Aeroplane Company (xvi) and Arthur Guinness (xx)).Most employers indicate that if either scheme were introduced they would have to adapt their occupational schemes. The danger of excessive pensions is widely recognised. Many pension funds are operated as Trusts and any future legislation would need to include powers to vary Trusts. Most employers indicate thatconsultation either with the staff or with trustees would be necessary, but noneexpect any substantial difficulties other than lengthy negotiations to arise over this.(/) General10.   The following more general points are made:  (i) Unilever (iv) make the point that only a State scheme can fully cover thewhole of a working lifetime when there are a number of changes inemployment. They point out the potential conflict in the private sectorbetween the desirability of keeping people in benefit for retirement pension, while at the same time ensuring a maximum mobility of labour.Many occupational pension schemes have been devised for theparticular purpose of ensuring continuity of service.(ii) A.E.I. (ii) emphasise that they prefer Scheme A because they do not thinkit right that employees earning  10 a week or less should have theirbenefits subsidised by those earning more than  10 a week.(iii) Several employers draw attention to the time lag between increased contributions and the emergence of improved benefits. It is suggestedthat this would lead to pressure for higher wages in order to meetincreased contributions. It is also suggested that pressure might welldevelop for unemployment and sick benefits to be on a graduated basis.(iv) Imperial Tobacco Company (vi) express the hope that careful consideration will be given to the argument that it is not the function of Governmentto attempt to provide universal wage-related schemes or to go beyondthe provision of a universally applicable basic retirement pension.(v) LCI. (v) state that, if a national scheme on the basis of Scheme A were tobe introduced, they would wish to contract out so that all their presentfunds could continue in addition to the basic State pensions.Appendix III. Nationalised Industries11. Most Nationalised Industries are in favour of Scheme A because of theprovision for contracting out, a course which they would wish to follow. TheBritish Transport Commission on balance would not contract out; and there is some doubt as to what would be done in respect of mine workers. The Minister of power is concerned about the danger of additional costs. If all the schemes in thepower group (coal, gas and electricity) were contracted out of Scheme A there wouldbe an additional cost to the three Boards of rather more than  1 million per annum.If the mine workers did not contract out and substituted Scheme A for their own, an
additional increase of  2 millions per annum would be involved. If Scheme B were introduced without adaptation of existing schemes the additional cost might be inthe region of  84- millions per annum. The main burden in each case would fall onthe National Coal Board. It is the general view that substantial discussions withthe staff associations and trade unions concerned would be required, andmodification of existing schemes might be difficult to agree. The danger of creating a situation in which contributions and pensions become excessively high is widely recognised.Appendix IV. The Public Services12. Most of the Ministers concerned have expressed the view that the public services under their aegis would be in favour of contracting out. The Minister ofEducation has commented that if Scheme B were adopted some modification of the teachers pension scheme would be needed in order to prevent the already high levels of contribution and benefits becoming excessive.Appendix V. Organisations Concerned with Pensions Schemes13. The Life Offices Association would oppose Scheme A, being alarmed atthe damage it would do to their industry and to the accumulation of private savings.They say that the administrative problems of contracting out would be *&apos; vast and complex &quot; and that the State scheme should not make provision beyond &quot; basicneed.&quot; They accept Scheme B as satisfying this idea. But they stress the desirabilityof &quot; quick maturity &quot; as imposing financial discipline on the Government of theday; and they oppose Scheme B.because it does not mature very much quicker thanScheme A. If quicker maturity were introduced they indicate one method Scheme B would be &quot; incomparably healthier,&quot; although they suggest that the exclusion of contracting out should be reconsidered if the theoretical impedimentscould be overcome. The transition to either scheme would, they say, take over fiveyears.14. The Association of Superannuation and Pension Funds doubt whether the considerable administrative problems of contracting out are worth facing. They donot think many employers would contract out, though some would appreciate the option to do so. Few, they think, would welcome the supervision or control thatwould be entailed. But they oppose the reduction in contributions involved inScheme B and they conclude in favour of Scheme A without contracting out.Appendix VI. Trades Union Congress Response15. The main points made by the Trades Union Congress are that a national scheme of wage-related superannuation should be additional to and not in substitution for a flat rate National Insurance pension; a substantial increase in national Insurance pensions is urgently needed; contributions to the national insurance pension should not exceed the amount actuarially required to providepension for those entering at 16 years of age; the Exchequer supplement shouldbe restored to its pre-1951 level; contributions in any wage-related sector should not constitute an unreasonable burden; occupational schemes should be allowed to contract out; and the option should be on an individual and not a group basis.
