confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITAlNNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. May 1958C. (58) 118 Copy No.27th May, 1958CABINETBRITANNIA aircraft memorandum by the Minister of power at their meeting on 31st October, 1957 the Cabinet considered an interim reportby the Committee which had been set up under my Chairmanship to consider what steps should be taken to ensure the satisfactory development of the Britannia aircraft in the light of the icing troubles which had beset its Proteus engine and seemed likelyat that time to give rise to serious issues affecting the future of the operations of theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) and the solvency of the bristol aeroplane Company (C.C. (57) 77th Conclusions, Minute 4). The Cabinet were theninformed of the work in progress on possible modifications of the Proteus engine andof certain steps which had been taken by the Government and by B.O.A.C. to relieve the immediate financial difficulties of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and agreedthat the Committee of Ministers should remain in being to keep the situation under continuous review.2. Development has since been mainly concentrated upon a redesign of the airintake of the Proteus engine whereby a system of multiple ducts leads the air past the obstructions and recesses where ice had previously accumulated, and upon an air jet system which blows air along the surfaces of the air intake at points of possibleice concentration. While the difficulties have not yet been completely overcome,very substantial progress has been made and it has been possible to decide on the modifications which should be incorporated in the aircraft. All the Britannias ofTransport Command will be fitted with the multi-duct intake, which is reasonablyeasy to introduce on the production line at the present stage of construction of their aircraft. For the B.O.A.C. aircraft either delivered or in a very advanced stage of construction the air jet system will be fitted, since this is the easier modification toundertake retrospectively. Further development work is however necessary on eachsolution in order to obtain the best results: the cost of this will fall within the totalof  J million which we have already approved. I understand that these concernedwith the operation as well as with the manufacture of the aircraft are satisfied withthe present position and are confident that the problem is on the way to final solution. B.O.A.C. have taken delivery of all fifteen of their medium rangeBritannias and eleven of the long range version out of eighteen on order, and arebringing the aircraft progressively into operation.3. As a result of the financial measures already taken by the Government and b.O.A.C. and of the progress achieved towards a solution of the icing difficultieswhich has enabled delivery of Britannias to be continued, the Bristol aeroplane company has succeeded in working within its overdraft limit of  18 millions.Provided that there is no further hold up on the Britannia the Company should beable to maintain this position up to next autumn, when its indebtedness to its bankis expected to fall by some  5 millions, if the sale of five aircraft to the AmericanNorth East Airlines is made as planned. But this sale may not take place on time;other customers for these aircraft have not yet been found; and the Company&apos;financial position may therefore remain somewhat precarious. It may be strengthened by the association negotiated between the aircraft and enginecompanies of Bristols and the Hawker/Siddeley Group, but to what extent it is notyet possible to say.
2CONFIDENTIAL4.: This financial problem, however; really forms part of the larger questionof the future of the aircraft industry generally. Unless unforeseen further difficulties arise, the particular dangers for B.O.A.C. and the Bristol Aeroplane Companyarising from the Britannia&apos;s icing troubles, which the Committee of Ministers was set up to consider, have been avoided. I propose therefore that the Committeeshould stand down, though it might remain formally in being in case any newdifficulties about the Britannia programme emerge.M.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,21st May, 1958.
