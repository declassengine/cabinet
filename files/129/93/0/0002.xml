APPENDIX ADRAFT V&apos;/IiIl&apos;S PAPER ON CYPRUS1.      The island of Cyprus, which has been under british control since 1373, occupies a key strategic position in theEastern Mediterranean, 1+0 miles off the Bouthemcoast ofTurkey.    Its population is about 80^ Greek-Cypriot and nearly20,. Turkish-Cypriot.2.      The United Kingdom itself has important strategic interestsin tne island which have not been disputed by our frjends.There has, however, long been a movement among Greek Cypriotsfor union v/ith Greece   and for unitary self-determination,v/hich recent Greek Governments have supported.    The TurkishGovernment and Turkish Cypriots have opposed that movement andhave recently claimed that Cyprus should be partitioned.These diverse views are the core of the Cyprus problem.3.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government have all along sought asolutionto the problem which could be accepted by both Cypriotcommunities and by all three governments concerned.    None ofthe solutions so far put forward has proved acceptable toall concerned, because of the incompatibility of certain oftheir present demands.    It is therefore clear that it willbe necessary, if any solution is to be reached, for each partyto make some sacrifice of its present position.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are ready to set an example by renouncing theirsole sovereignty over Cyprus,  if the other parties will matchthis by renouncing their demands for unitary self-determination and for the partition of the island,J+.      These renunciations would open the way for an imaginativeand a new solution, designed to suit the altogether peculiarcircumstances of Cyprus.      This solution would consist of ascheme for sharing the island&apos;s sovereignty between the three governments in a 3-Power Condominium, as a form of partner-ship between allied and friendxy nations.    This Tridominium-1-
would cover the whole island except for certain smallmilitary enclaves required to enable the United Kingdom to fulfil its strategic responsibilities, which would beretained under sole British sovereignty.5.      The details of the scheme would have to be carefullyworked out, and made the sublet of a Tripartite Treaty.The main provisions of the scheme would be on the lines set out in the following paragraphs of this paper.The Governor6.      There would be a Governor appointed jointly by thethree codomoni, to whom he would be responsible for thedischarge of all his functions.    Should there be difficultyin reaching agreement on a suitable candidate, his selectionmight be referred (if this were generally agreeable)  to aCommittee drawn from friendly nations not directly concernedwith the Cyprus problem.Local Representatives of the Godomini7*      The three codomini would each have a residentRepresentative in Cyprus, with the right of direct access to the Governor,Three Power Consultation8.      In addition, there would be machinery for consultation between the codomini at governmental level in the form of a council of the Three Powers meeting at regular intervals.The Constitution9.      A new constitution would be introduced under which thegovernment of the island, except for certain reserved matters, would be entrusted to democratically elected representatives of both the principal communities and to ministers responsible to those representatives.Guarantees of non-discrimination and fundamental rights10.    Special provisions would be written into the constitution to guarantee non-discrimination on grounds of race, religion-2-
TOP SECRETor &quot;birth and to preserve fundamental rights,  especially inregard to religion,  education and matters traditionally ofspecial concern to a particular community.Reserved Functions11.    There would &quot;be three reserved functions on which theGovernor would not &quot;be obliged to consult the electedMinisters:-(a) External AffairsThe external affairs of Cyprus would be theresponsibility of the three codomini.    They would be free to delegate part of this responsibility to the Governoracting in consultation with their resident Representatives.(b) defence the defence of the island would be entrusted to theUnited Kingdom alone on behalf of the three codomini.(c) Internal SecurityInternal security would be the responsibility of theGovernor, acting in consultation with the residentRepresentatives and on instructions from the ccdomini:    if in any circumstances he were unable to obtain unanimousinstructions he would have the authority to take essentialdecisions on his own.    /Ee would be assisted by the police force and also by a military force composed of equal contingent of British, Greek and Turkish troops.      The Commanding Officerof the military force would be selected &quot;by the three codominibut would be appointed by and responsible to the Governor.The entry of Greek.and Turkish troops into Cyprus would not take place until after the transfer of sovereignty to thecodomini./Other matters12.    There would be other matters, e.g.  regarding theadministration of justice and the economic and financial arrangements consequent upon -che introduction of Tridominium,which would fall to be settled by agreement between thethree governments. ^
Nationality13*    The present inhabitants of Cyprus would he entitled under the Tridominium Treaty to apply for either Greek orTurkish nationality,  to &quot;be held in conjunction with theirexisting British nationality.    This would enable thern to fulfil their national aspirations while retaining the manypractical advantages of their present status.ConclusionA policy based on these principles and proposals willgive the people of the Island a specially favoured andprotected status.    They will exercise authority throughrepresentative institutions in the rranagement of the Island&apos;internal affairs, and communal affairs will be fullyprotected.      While the people of the Island enjoy these advantages friendly relationships and practical co-operationbetween the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey will bemaintained and strengthened,  as Cyprus becomes a symbol ofco-operation instead of a cause of friction between thethree Allied Governments.

APPENDIX BCOr IEKTARYGeneralThe . hite Paper has been deliberately drafted so as toleave the plan as free of detail as possible,  andsufficiently flexible (except on the subject of defence)to permit the Greek and Turkish Governments to contributetheir own elaborations.      Both Governments are less likelyto react unfavourably to the plan if they are not made to feel that we already have it uncompromisingly worked catdown to the last particular.British Enclaves   (paragraph U of .7hite Paper)2.      The retention of British military enclaves is an integral part of the plan.      These enclaves are delineatedin full red on the map attached to C.(58) 89-      Theseenclaves would depend upon, the granting of a number of facilities outside their perimeter,  e.g. electric light,water, and rights of access, notabl^y to the port ofFamagusta.3.      The retention of the two principal enclaves, Akrotiri/Episkopi and Dhekhelia/Permagos under full british sovereignty is essential.      Thoxigh for the purposes ofinitial presentation the remaining enclaves should all beregarded as being of the same status as the two principalones, we should,  in fact, be content to hold them underlease, with suitable supporting rights, provided that wecould continue to use the leased areas to the same extentafter the introduction of Tridominium as now,  and were free to negotiate for stich further leases as may prove necessaryfor the discharge of our defence obligations.I+.     A proposal to merge the suggested enclaves in the CapeGreco peninsula south and east of Famagusta undercircumstances of tridominium was rejected in C.(57)  265.:  - - -5-
A further extension of the merged areas to include theport of Pamagusta under circumstances amounting virtuallyto partition   was put forward in 0.(58)  39.      Theextension of British sovereignty, and consequently british administration,  to include an area containing a largeGreek-Cypriot popalation and the principal port would however &quot;be contrary to the concept of Tridorainium andwould present us with an unacceptable internal securityproblem.5.      Certain of cur military installations outside thetv/o sovereign enclaves could be moved and located withinthem.      But in some cases this would undoubtedly entailheavy expenditure and there wouldalso be technical objections,.    Certain of these facilitiesho-ever are dependent on their geographical location and cannot be moved.The Governor ( paragraph 6 of White Paper)6.      There is no reason why the Governor should not be anational of one of the Tridominium Powers if an acceptable candidate can be found.      But in practice hewould almost certainly have to be from sane other country,preferably a NATO member.      The wording of the draft white paper is designed to point tie way to his selection (inthe event of disagreement between the codomini) by saneor all of the members of NATO other than the codomini; butthe consent of the NATO countries would,  of course, have to&quot;be obtained before this plan could be publicly announced.There would also have to be some provision for the dismissal of the Governor by agreement &quot;between all threecodomini;  it will be for consideration whether he shouldalso &quot;be dismissable at the instance of only two of thecodcmini.-6-
Loca1 Representatives .01 the Oodomini( paragraph 7 of White Paper)7.     The precise functions of these Representatives wouldhe a matter for negotiation between, the three Governments.Their main function would be in connexion with reserved matters or matters relating to the Turkish community:  inother fields, the Governor would under the Constitutionnormally be obliged to act on the advice of his electedMinisters.Three &quot;* ower Consultation (paragraph 3 of White Paper)3.      The main purpose of the Three Power Council would beto formalise relations between the three Powers on matters relating to Cyprus and to provide a regular forum in which their views on the subject could be exchanged.      otherwise there would be a danger of Cyprus problems dominating and damaging the normal relations of the three Powers with each other.    The Council would presumably require apermanent secretariat; the composition of this and the siting of its headquarters would be for negotiation.The Constitution (paragraph 9 of White Paper)9.      It was assumed last year that the Radcliffe proposals would form the basis of the constitution under Tridominium.The Radcliffe proposals provided for a constitution on a unitary, unicameral, but diarchical basis, with an Assemblywith a majority of seats filled by members elected on acommon roll, and minoiities of seats filled by TurkishCypriots and by nominees of the Governor.      Carefularrangements were devised to protect community interests.There would have been a Cabinet,  responsible to the Assembly.The Governor has since commented that the Radcliffe plan was designed for a regime of undivided British sovereignty,and would have to be radically altered to fit Tridominium;
he adds that anything reminiscent of the RadcliffeConstitution would be opposed by the Turkish Cypriots atleast as vigorously as by the Greek Cypriots.10.    The Governor has accordingly put forward analternative constitutional plan which differs from the radcliffe plan in providing for a separate Assembly foreach of the two communities and in giving these Assemblieslegislative authority in communal affairs (v/hich theGovernor considers is necessary for any successfulconstitutional plan).      The Governor1s pi n also proposes that internal affairs,  other than communal affairs and internal security,  should be dealt with by a Council witha predominance of elected Ministers drawn from bothAssemblies; this Council would have a majority of GreekCypriot Ministers, but would include at least two turkish cypriot Ministers, and the Governor would have reserve powers to ensure protection of the interests of bothcommuniti es.11.    Since the beginning of this year, the TurkishGovernment have insisted., as part of their propaganda forpartition, that the two communities can no longer livetogether&quot;; this argument should certainly incline the Turksto oppose a Radcliffe-type constitution even if presented as part of a Tridominium plan.      But the other aspects ofTridominium are distinctly more acceptable to the Turksthan to the Greeks,  and the Governor&apos;s suggestion for separate communal Assemblies might be regarded by the greeks as favouring ultimate partition.12.    The phrasing of this part of the White Paper has been specially drafted so as to leave open the possibility ofthe constitution taking the form of the Radcliffe proposalsor of the Governor&apos;s proposals.
Fundamental Rights and Guarantees of Non-Discrimination( paragraph 10 of White paper)13.    One part of the Radcliife proposals v/hich it isproposed should be included in the internal constitutional arrangements under Tridominium is the various safeguardsproposed for the rights of the Turkish Cy.priot community.We have it in mind that these be safeguarded by theSupreme Court and a Tribunal of Guarantees.      The&apos;institutions designed for this purpose need not, however,be set out in detail in the White Paper.Reserved Powers11+.    Apart from action by the Governor in conn.ec.tion withthe three reserved functions mentioned in the White Paper(paragraph 11), it would presumably be necessary for theGovernor to be empowered in certain circumstances to take action (either legislative or executive)  in the non-reserved field on instructions of the codomini, e. g., toprevent a financial breakdown.      The delimitation of the fields in which the Governor has reserved functions (seeparagraph 16 below)  would clearly present considerable difficulties of definition and the extent to v/hich theGovernor would be entitled to exercise special powersoutside those fields would no doubt prove one of the most difficult topics for negotiation.External Affairs (paragraph 11(a)  of White Paper)15.    There would,  of course, be no question of anyrepresentation for the Cyprus Government in foreigncoiintries.    Equally, Cyprus would not belong to any majorinternational organisation,  although it might be necessaryfor her to have at least some associate relationship withcertain technical organisations,  e. g. the InternationalPostal Union.
Defence (paragraph 11(h)  of White Paper)16.    Under Tridominlum the greater part of Cyprus wouldhe under the joint sovereignty of the codomini, whilecertain military enclaves would remain under british sovereignty.     The Governor might be empowered to take anyinternal action (legislative or executive)  dictated by defence requirements on the advice of the british representative.      Past experience shows however that sucha provision is liable to raise formidable problems ofdefinit ion.17.    The suggestion has been made that NATO should assume responsibility for the defence of the Island.    Such an invitation would differentiate between 3ritish sovereignty over the enclaves and joint sovereignty over the rest of cyprus.18.    If the North Atlantic Council accepted this responsibility and declared Cyprus to be part of the NATOarea,  the next step would be for the Council to inviteSACEUR to indicate what  amendments,   if any, to hisapproved plans for the defence of NATO he might wish to propose, to take account of this addition to the NATO area.The defence of the Island,  in effect, means defence against air attack and control of the sea approaches.    It would,in any case, be necessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government toprovide for defence against air attack on the light bomberbase at Akrotiri and on our military enclaves generally.Plans are being worked out which will provide fighter aircraft for this purpose within the existing financialand manpower ceilings of the Royal Air Force.19.    SACEUR would be likely, therefore, to report to theNorth Atlantic Council that the arrangements being madeby Her Majesty&apos;s Government within that part of Cyprus
which remained under British sovereignty would he adequate to provide an air defence for the rest, or Tridorainium,part of the Island.20.    Nevertheless, the G-reel: or Turkish Governments might put forward counter proposals for the provision of Greekor Turkish forces cased on Cyprus under NATO command forthe ostensible purpose of the Island&apos;s defence.    It wouldbe normal NATO practice to obtain the advice of the NATOMilitary Authorities, who would be unlikely to concur.In any case, Eer Majesty&apos;s Government would he able to oppose any such suggestions, not only as one of thecodomini,. but also as a member of the North atlantic council.21.    There is no reason why defence should not he a NATOresponsibility if it were solely a question of defence against Soviet and satellite forces in a major war, whichmust be global.      The United Kingdom, however, would beretaining military facilities for her own use in circumstances which might not involve NATO.      In such an event, the external defence of Cyprus against a country of the Middle East might be required an a case where NATOwould not wish to be involved.22.    If the United Kingdom therefore were to be free touse Cyprus in such a case,  it would he essential that she should retain sole responsibility for its external defence.Other members of NATO would also probably be opposed to theassumption of this responsibilits^ by NATO.23.    Finally,  it is possible that transfer ofresponsibility for defence to NATO might cause douhtamongst members of the Bagdad Pact as to the UnitedKingdom&apos;s freedom to discharge her responsibilities tothat Pact.
Internal Security (paragraph ll( c)  of White Paper2h.    We have based paragraph 11(c) upon the assumptionthat Greek and Turkish, as well as British,  troops wouldbe stationed in the Island in support of the civil power.This would have presentational advantages for the Turks,though not for the Greeks,  and in theory should lessenour own commitment.      The solution to the internal securityproblern under Tridominium depends however upon thecontinued acceptance of the plan by all concerned as asatisfactory and lasting political settlement of the wholeCyprus issue.      The population consists of two differentraces and any communal strife is most likely to be catisedby national differences.    Under these circumstances the calling in of military forces provided by Greece or turkey to aid the civil po..&apos;er might exacerbate the situation emdthese troops could be used as the medium for furthersubversion by one or other of the two communities.      this might mean that British troops would be the only ones whichcould be used.     As the Governor might use these troops at his own uiscretion in the absence of unanimousinstructions from the codomini,  it would mean that british forces could be employed on task over which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had no control and of which they might disapprove.25.    In any case,  assuming that there would be a periodof administrative reorganisation immediately after theassumption of sovereignty by the codomini, the provisionof internal security forces during such a period mightremain a wholly British responsibility which would beundertaken by troops from the enclaves.Other Matters (paragraph 12 of the White Paper)26.    The economic and financial problems arising fromtridominium have already been examined by officials as
set out in 0.(57) 275, and appear to raise no insuperableobstacles. The issues involved fall under the following headings:I.     Arrangements for handling commercial cuestions:(a) Rights and obligations of Cyprus under existing treaties;    those .;hich have been previously assumed by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould need to be assumed by the codomini jointlyin respect of Cyprus.(b) Representation of Cyprus&apos;  interests in international commercial negotiations; thiswould be most practically effected by one ofthe   codomini being charged with this by theother two.(c) Imperial preference; whether the UnitedKingdom or other countries would continue to givepreferences to Cyprus would depend primarily on whether they continued to enjoy preferences there.1 ^*    Provision of financial and technical assistanceM^Cj^rus -.....................................(a) Contributions to ordinary budget;    there wouldbe no question oi a permanent contribution by theUnited Kingdom, as envisaged in the Radcliffeproposals.(b) Development finance; United Kingdom commitments to Cyprus development should be reduced to theminimum.( c)    Technical aid;    there would be no objection in principle to continued United Kingdom technicalaid to Cyprus,n I -    Cyprus&apos;  relationship with the Sterling&quot; Area.Our aim in negotiations should be for Cyprus to stay in the Sterling Area.
IV.    External loans,  currency and banking(a) London Market loans;  it would be necessary tomake arrangements to secure the protection of therights of holders of existing Cyprus loan stockissued in London.(b) Form of currency; it would be best for cyprus to retain its own separate currency.( c)    Banking; it would be desirable to ensure that legislation regulating banking should require theconsent of the codomini.Nationality ( paragraph 13 of iYhite Paper)27.    There are no suitable precedents for nationalityunder a condominium.      Natives of the New Hebrides (Anglo-French condominium) have no nationality.     Natives of theSudan during the Anglo-Egyptian condominium held neitherBritish nor Egyptian nationality, but had the status (notnationality)  of Sudanese citizens; they travelled abroador, Sudanese passports issued in the Governor1 s name.23.    The question of nationality is however an essential feature of the Tridominium plan for purposes of presentation,  although Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador Athensconsiders that it would not have much attraction for the greeks.29.    The Greek and Turkish Governments would presumablyinsist on their right to reject unsuitable applicants forGreek or Turkish nationality;    in such cases, or where no application is made, British nationality would be retainedalone.    It would not be desirable automatically to impose a second nationality on anyone, nor to allow any Cypriotto hold both Turkish and Greek nationality.     A Cypriot of21 or over obtaining Greek or Turkish nationality wouldbe entitled to renounce his British nationality if he-lk-
wished.      Special consideration would also have to be given to the question of the national status of personshorn in Cyprus,  or horn outside Cyp.us of parents ofCypriot origin, after the establishment of the Tridominium:whatever solution were adopted, some amendment of the.British Nationality Act would almost certainly De required.Dual nationality Cypriots travelling abroad would-presumably be entitled to the protection of whichever oftheir two consulates they preferred, subject to the normal rule for dual nationals that they would not be entitledto consular protection from one nation when within theterritory of the other.international,i.onal jGuaraj.iteeg30.    The possibility of international guarantees of thesettlement has not been referred to in the White Paper,but would be a matter for discussion and negotiation withthe Greek and Turkish and other Governments.     The inter-national instrument guaranteeing the Tridorainium regimewould be the actual Treaty between the three Powers whichbrought it into force.    But there would no doubt be ademand for further international guarantees, and for thispurpose it might be possible to persuade the United StatesGovernment (and perhaps other NATO Governments as vvell)  to underwrite the treaty in the way that the British and american Governments were asked to underwrite the Franco-German Saar Settlement of 195^.     Alternatively, there could be provision in the Treaty for disputes to bereferred either,  with the necessary NATO agreement, to the nato Council (i.e.  in view of the NATO unanimity rule, tothe NATO Council sitting withoxit the codomini), or to theInternational Court of Justice at the Hague, or to a-15-
neutral High Commissioner.      Complaints by individualCypriots of&apos; discrimination or of violation of theirguaranteed rights would, however, be dealt with under theprovisions outlined in paragraph 13 above, for theprotection of fundamental rights and the prevention of discrimination.
