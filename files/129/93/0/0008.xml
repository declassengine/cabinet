THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 108     . COPY NO.14th May, 1958CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Attorney-general on 13th May the Cabinet (C.C.(58) 41st Conclusions, Minute 4)invited me to circulate a memorandum on our legal grounds for resisting ,if necessary by the use of force, any claim which the Icelandic government might make to exclusive fishery rights over an area of the high seas.Z.   each state enjoys, subject to any relevant international agreement,an exclusive right of fishery in waters subject to its jurisdiction.   Thehigh seas are not subject to the jurisdiction of any State and in consequenceno exclusive right of fisheryin them is recognised by international law.3.   It follows that a State asserting an exclusive right of fishery in any area of the sea can justify its claim only by establishing that that areaforms part of its territorial waters.   The question whether any area ofthe sea forms part of the territorial waters of a State is a question ofinternational law which cannot be determined by the mere assertion of theclaim.   The claim may be established by the acquiescence of other states in it, but there is no question of the present Icelandic claim being established in this manner and, in my opinion, it should not, in its present form, be upheld by the International Court.4.   The immediate practical question, however, is whether we canlawfully prevent the Icelandic Government from enforcing its claim byarresting our fishing vessels on the high seas and taking proceedings against their masters.   Ships are regarded by international law as subjectto the jurisdiction, and accordingly entitled to the protection, of the Statewhose flag they fly.   One consequence of this rule is that the use of armed force to protect our ships is governed by the same rules as apply to theuse of force in defence of British territory.5.   The rules of international law relating to the use of armed forceotherwise than on the authority of the United Nations were considered bythe International Court in the Corfu Channel Case as recently as 1949.They may be summarised as recognising the use of force as lawful if,and only if, &quot;the necessity of self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation&quot;.   This means in practice that, if a State&apos;s legal right is infringed or threatened by another state, it may lawfully use the degree of force (and no more than the degreeof force) necessary to affirm that right and ensure its future recognition by the State infringing or threatening it.   It does not, however, mean thatthe injured State is entitled to use force by way of reprisal, redress ofself-help.-1-
6.   The question what degree of force is justified by any particularsituation is necessarily a question of fact depending on all the circum-stances of that situation.   It is, however, clear that the mere assertionby the Icelandic Government of its claim to an extended area of territorial waters would not of itself justify either the use of force or anything inthe nature of a demonstration of force;   on the other hand, the use of force by Icelandic vessels in support of the claim would entitle us touse force, including armed force, in resisting it.   The use of force byIcelandic vessels in these circumstances would, if it were the act ofprivate vessels, constitute piracy and even if it is authorised by the icelandic Government may be resisted by all necessary force.   Inparticular, a trawler on the high seas would be entitled to refuse to obeythe orders of Icelandic fishery protection vessels and to do all that laywithin her power to oppose an attempt to put a boarding party on her;and force could lawfully be used by our naval units to prevent her arrestor, if she were nevertheless arrested, to secure her release.R.E.M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C.2.14th May, 1958
