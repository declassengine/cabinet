A copy isattached as Annex A.   It was well received by the Rulers at the time, but because of mutual rivalries and jealousies they made no progress in working out detailed proposals of their own, and until a few months agoit seemed that the whole idea of federation in the Protectorate was likelyto die if we did not do something to keep it alive.2.      The Aden Protectorate is valuable to Her Majesty&apos;s government as a buffer between the Yemen and to a lesser extent Saudi Arabia on theone hand, and Aden Colony with its important defence facilities, port andrefinery on the other.   Until recently, the present Governor,Sir William Luce, thought that the creation of a federation or federationsin the Protectorate would not in its ultimate effects best serve the interestsof Her Majesty&apos;s Government, since it would lead to pressure first forthe inclusion of the Colony in a federation and then for the larger countrythus created to be piven complete independence.   Recent events have,however, caused those Rulers who are most friendly to us and mostdetermined in their opposition to the Yemen to overcome their mutualrivalries and jealousies sufficiently to agree among themselves on thedesirability of establishing a federation.   The Governor has also concluded that federation in the Western Aden Protectorate might make it possiblefor Her Majesty&apos;s Government to retain essential defence and other facilitiein what is now the Colony of Aden longer than could otherwise be done.3.      The Rulers in the Western Aden Protectorate who have taken theinitiative on this are the Audhali Sultan, the Sherif of Beihan (who speaksfor his son, the Emir, and in fact directs policy in Beihan), the Emir ofDhala,and the .Fadhli Naib (the brother of the Sultan who, on. of the Sultan,directs policy in the Fadhli State).,   They have told both the governor and myself that they consider it desirable to form a federation to makethe defence of their States against Yemeni, attacks more effective and tooffer their people a better future than they can offer to them individually.They have asked Her Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage and help themin the formation of a federation and to help the federation when formedmilitarily and financially.   They contemplated that the federation should enter into treaty relationships with Her Majesty&apos;s Government whichwould provide for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to afford to the federation-1-
not only protection but also advice which the Federal Government wouldbe bound to accept;   but it would be provided that the agreement, andparticularly the advisory clause in it, would be subject to review at therequest of either party at any time, though the revision would be only by mutual agreement.   The federation would thus be as closely bound toHer Majesty&apos;s Government as the individual States are at present;  and itis the very firmly   expressed wish of the Rulers themselves that thisshould be so.    It is also the Rulers&apos; firm wish that their individualProtectorate Advisory Treaties should remain in force.   On the otherhand, with their eye on the reactions in the Arab world, the Rulers wouldalso wish any statement made at the time when the federation was launchedto contain some words designed to make it clear that the ultimate objective would be for the federation, when it was eventually capable of doing so, to become independent and enter into a new kind of treaty-relationship with Her Majesty&apos;s government.      If Her Majesty&apos;s Government encourage   the formation of a federation in the Western Frotectorate, it is almost certain that, inaddition to the founder members, two other States - Dathina and theShuaib - would join from the beginning and the Lower Yafai and UpperAulaqui Sheikdom would probably follow.   The attitude of the remainingsmall States in the Western F&apos;rotectorate is still uncertain.   The Sultanof the larger State, Lahej, opposes federation, partly because he has beenled by the Jiffri brothers to consider other ideas more pleasing to Cairo,viz., some link with United Arab States and partly because he knows thathe would never be acceptable to the majority of the other Rulers as theleading figure in the federation.    Fossibly, however, when he sees thatthe majority of the Rulers in the Western Protectorate are determined tocreate a federation, he will decide to come in on it;   and it is also possiblethat, if he does not so decide, public opinion in Lahej will either force himto change his attitude or make his position.untenable.   The States in theEastern Protectorate are not likely to join the proposed federation fromthe beginning.    Fossibly, some of them would decide to form a separatefederation and there might later be a link up between the two federations.5.      The Governor has had preliminary talks with the four Rulers referreto in paragraph 3 above about the military and financial arrangements whichwould need to be made if it were decided to launch the proposed federation in the Western Protectorate.6.      The intention would be to organise a Federal National Guard(armed police) from a Combination of all the existing Government Guardsin the Western Frotectorate and the Tribal Guards of those States in theWestern Protectorate which joined the federation, who would have to be trained and equipped to Government Guards&apos; standards.   The Rulersoriginally suggested that their total forces should be 20,000 strong butthe Governor has persuaded them, on the understanding that the R.A.F.and British ground forces would be ready to support the federation in caseof need as at present, that a National Guard of 3,700, as described above,would be adequate.   This would involve increasing the number of Govern-ment Guards by 1^000;  but the Governor tells me that it would in any case be necessary for him to ask for the strength of this force to be increasedby 600, so that the increase due to federation would be only 400.   ThisNational Guard would be brought intn being as soon as federation was established.   Additionally it would be agreed that the Aden Protectorate-2-
Levies would in due course also become part of the forces of the federation.This latter change would, however, be carefully phased.   irrespective of the federation proposals, there is an immediate need, on security grounds, for an increase of one battalion in the strength of the aden protectorate Levies;   and proposals will shortly be made.   internal security and defence of those States not in the federation would remain the responsibility of the Governor, and for this purpose a separate defence agreement would be negotiated under which the Federal Governmentw nild undertake to make available such of its forces as might be requiredby the Governor for security and defence action in areas outside thefederation.   A special problem exists as to whether this availability should extend to the Eastern part of the Protectorate but this is being examinedinter-departmentally and with the Governor.    There would be an ArabMinister of Defence in the Federal Government.   There would, however,also be a British Chief of Staff, and policy control of the forces would bein the hands of a Defence Committee of which the Governor would be theChairman and the Commander, British Forces in the Arabian Peninsulawould be a member, and on which the federation would be represented.In case of need, the final say would of course rest with the Governor by virtue of the defence agreement, and additionally through the use of his power to give to the Federal Government advice which that Governmentwould be bound to follow.7.      The establishment of the federation would also involve other expenditure of a political and administrative nature.   The best estimates which can at present be provided, after consultation with the Governor,show that, in order to deal with the increased threat presented by thecreation of the United Arab Republic and Egyptian and Russian assistanceto the Yemen, it will in any case be necessary to increase current expenditure in the Aden Protectorate by about  568,000 a year and toundertake new capital expenditure amounting to about  400,000 a year,spread over, say, two years.   The additional cost over and above this ofestablishing the federation would, it is estimated, amount to about 360,000 capital and about  680,000 a year recurrent.   Thus, on the basisof nine months of federation in 1953/59, and taking into account the likelyphasing of the capital expenditure, additional expenditure in the aden protectorate in each of the financial years 1958/59 and 1959/60 is estimatedat about  1. 5 millions.   These figures do not take account of suchincreased expenditure on social and economic development as may be approved as a result of the forthcoming visit to the Protectorate of a commissioner who is to carry obut the enquiry looking towards anenhanced programme which was approved by Ministers in January,   it isnot possible to give a firm estimate for this until the Commissioner has reported.   What the Governor had in mind was that it might be necessaryto spend capital expenditure of about  2.6 millions spread over fiveyears and recurrent expenditure of  550,000 a year.   It has been agreedthat expenditure on this programme should not start until the financialyear 1959/60.   The reafter it will no doubt take a little time for theprogramme to get under way.8.      It is the future of Aden Colony which is crucial.   Retention of sovereignty is the only way of making absolutely certain in Aden as  else-where that defence and other facilities will continue to be available;  andthe establishment of a federation in the Western Protectorate would belikely to lead in the end to a position in which it would be very difficult forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to retain sovereignty in Aden Colony, inasmuch-3-
as once federation is firmly established there will be strong pressure inthe Colony to join it.   On the other hand, if Ker Majesty&apos;s Governmentopposed, or refused to help, the creation of a federation in the WesternProtectorate, the retention of sovereignty in Aden Colony will be equallydifficult, and the difficulties will materialise more rapidly.   Moreover,if the Colony is e&quot;entually absorbed into the federation there is a reasonable prospect of Her Maj-esty&apos;s Government being able to retain facilities thereby means of treaty arrangements, whereas this will certainly be animpossibility if Her Majesty&apos;s GoV^xnment is driven out of Aden by increasing subversion and nationalist pressure directed from Cairo.An attempt to retain the Colony by force wouia become an increasingly difficult and expensive operation and, with Arab world opinion against us,our position would become less and less tenable.   Further, if vve fail to respond to this initiative from the Rulers most friendly disposed towards us, it seems certain that they will feel obliged to make their peace withthe Yemen or to look to Cairo, as the Sultan of JLahej is already tempted to do:   if they did so, the threat to the Colony would at once becomeimm ediate.9.      I have therefore come to the conclusion that certainly the best and perhaps the only course which Her Majesty&apos;s Government can adopt is tohelp the friendly Rulers in the Western Protectorate to form a federation and to give them the support and assistance for which they have asked.If we do, I would expect a movement to grow up in favour of the Colonybecoming part of the federation, and I would also expect that later on -say in three or four years&apos; time - the balance of advantage will appearto Her Majesty&apos;s Government to be in favour of such a development.   Forthe present, however, I consider that we should say and do nothing whichwould in any way prejudge the decision which will later have to be taken on this;  and should it then appear that it would be possible and preferable for Ker Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to administer the Colony as a colony, an attempt to do so should be no more difficult then than it wouldbe now in a situation in which we had refused to support the formation of a federation in the Western Protectorate.10.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofDefence share my views.   The Foreign Secretary hopes that the titlechosen for the federation will be designed to stress its Arab character,and I propose to suggest to the Rulers that it should be called &quot;The Federationof the Arab Emirates of the South&quot; (their own suggestion was &quot;The Federationof the Emirates of the South&quot;).   The Minister of Defence is anxious thatwe should take whatever steps we can to ensure that, if and when it becomes no longer possible to maintain our present position in AdenColony, there remains some territory in the area over which we retainsovereignty.   One suggestion which he has made is that, before the newConstitution for the Colony of Aden comes into force early next year, the island of Ferim should be separated from the Colony and arrangements madefor it to be administered by the Governor as a separate unit.   There is a risk that this might give the impression in Aden that we are unsure of ourposition there.   But I think it should be possible to make the change withoutarousing undue attention, and I will consider how best it could be done,possibly in conjunction with a similar and simultaneous removal from theColony of the Kuria and Muria islands.   It would be necessary for her majesty&apos;s Government to meet the cost, hitherto borne from Aden Colonyrevenues, of administering Perim which is at present running at about  11,500 a year.-4-
11.    Another suggestion which the Minister of Defence has made isthat, before the new Colony Constitution comes into force, there should beexcised from the Colony the area of the present base at Khormaksar, andany additional land required to make it viable.   Although I am doubtfulwhether such an excision would be physically practicable, I am very readyto ask the Governor to examine the physical practicability of it inconsultation with the Commander, British Forces, A.den Peninsula.   Iam sure, however, that if this should prove a practicable proposition,the time to consider its implementation would be if and when we were considering changing the status of Aden Colony itself.   The Governorholds the view very strongly - and I must say that I agree with him -that the only result of raising this issue now would be to cause dismayamong all our friends in Aden and to give rise to a very strong demandeither for the immediate independence of the whole Colony or for its immediate incorporation in the proposed federation.12.    The Chancellor recognises the merits of the proposal for a federationbut has reserved his position regarding the expenditure involved.   the aden Protectorate is already costing us a little over  3 millions a year.It looks as though this rate of expenditure may need, to be nearly doubledat any rate over the next few years, whilst the capital expenditure is still being incurred.   Most of the increase arises from the increased threatand only about one-third from the federation proposals themselves.   ButI realise only too well what difficulties these increases must raise forthe Chancellor.   The Chiefs of Staff have, however, just re-affirmed that(whilst there is no military objection to federation), if Ker Majesty&apos;governments present policy in the Persian Gulf is to be maintained,the retention of Aden as a military base is essential.   If we were to refuseto support the proposal for a federation in the Western Protectorate andwithhold the assistance for which the friendly Rulers have asked, the pressure against the Colony would build up rapidly and within a fairlyshort time we would most probably be faced with the alternatives either ofgiving up our position there or of attempting - perhaps unsuccessfully -to hold it by force at far greater cost than would be entailed by the federationproposals.   In addition, we should in this circumstance also be faced wthsubstantially greater internal liabilities in the Protectorate itself.13.    The four &quot;federationist&quot; Rulers concerned are in this country, ontheir own initiative, and are anxious to know the views of Ker Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding their proposals.   I have arranged to meet the mall on 29th June and it will then be necessary to disclose our general attitude towards these proposals.14.    I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree:-(1)    that I should tell the friendly Rulers that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfavour the formation in the Western Protectorate of a federationwhich would enter into the sort of treaty relationship with her majesty&apos;s Government which they have been discussing with theGovernor;   and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will in principlebe willing to give military and financial support to such a federation;-5-
(2)    that the military and financial support to be given should be of theorder described in paragraph 7 of this memorandum, but that Ishould reach agreement on the precise details with the chancellor and the Minister of Defence;(3)    that steps should be taken with the least possible publicity toexcise Ferim and possibly the Kuria Muria islands from AdenColony and to arrange for them to be administered by theGovernor as a separate unit;   and(4)    that the question of the practicability of excising at a later stagea part of the Colony for military purposes against future developments should be further examined.A.L..-3.Colonial Office, S.W.1.23rd June, 1958-6-
ANNEX AStatement made x^rivately by the then Governor of Aden(Sir Tom Hickinbotham) to the Rulers of the ProtectedStates onTTst March, 1956Her Majesty&apos;s Government have now reconsidered their long-term policy towards the States of the Protectorate in the light of recent events and of the reactions of the Rulers to the proposals for federation put forward in 1954.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of abandoningtheir responsibilities towards these States, who have voluntarily enteredinto the treaty relationship, and will continue to afford them their protection and assistance towards the ends indicated below.2.      It is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, accepted by all parties, to guide and assist all dependent territories towards the maximumpolitical and economic development which the circumstances of each maywarrant.   This policy applies as much to the States in these Protectoratesas to the territories for which Her Majesty&apos;s Government are directly responsible.   Individually, however, the Protected States are small inarea, population and resources and even if oil were discovered in any ofthem only one or two of them at most would ever be individually viable.If is therefore the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that these Statesv/ould be best advised to seek some form of closer association between themselves of mutual assistance and support, in order to strengthen their internal economy and social organisation with a view to their furthereconomic and political development.     It is with this and no other end inview that the federation proposals were made.   But Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment do not consider that there should necessarily be only one federationof these States, if two or more seemed to them more appropriate to theircircumstances and existing relationships;   or that such a federation orfederations should necessarily involve any particular type of organisation.The Rulers and peoples of these States are entirely free to negotiate among themselves, with such advice and assistance of Her Majesty&apos;s government as they may require, such form of closer association as may suit them best.3.      If such a federation or federations were formed Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to afford to them protection and assistancesimilar to that which they at present afford to the individual States.
