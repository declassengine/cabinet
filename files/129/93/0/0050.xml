FORESTRY policy memorandum by th . Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of A griculture, Fisheries and FoodLast autumn the Home Affairs Committee authorised theappointment of an inter-Departmental Working Party to review the bases and objectives of the forestry programme in Great Britain,taking account of the social, economic and defence considerations involved, and in the light of experience gained since the war.   Theirreport has now been discussed by the Home Affairs Committee whoasked us to make proposals to the Cabinet in the light of the report and the Committee&apos;s discussion (H.A.(5o) 14th Meeting, Item 6).2. This paper sets out our proposals, and a draft statement whichwould be made in Parliament before the recess is annexed.General policy.      In 1943 a target was set of 5 million acres of effective woodlandin Great Britain by the year 2000.   Of this, 3 million acres would beowned by the Forestry Commission.   We think that the setting of targets of this kind so far ahead is of little value, and propose that theGovernment should neither repeat this target nor disown it.   Weconsider, however, that in present conditions the restriction of fellingsto a prescribed annual quota is no longer necessary.   The essentialthing is to maintain a large area of well-managed and productivewoodland.Forestry Commission4.      We propose that in future the planting programme of the forestry Commission should be settled for periods of ten years at atime.   We should settle now the programme for 1959 to 1968.   For thefive years from 1959 to 1963 the programme should be 300,000 acres,and for 1964 to 1968 235,000 acres.   We would prefer that the programme should be announced as 53 5,000 acres in the ten years, in order toavoid public controversy over the run-down.   In the light of thediscussion at the Home Affairs Committee we would, however, reluctantlybe prepared to announce it as two five-year programmes.   the forestry Commission would agree with the forestry Ministers the annualplanting programme and its geographical distribution within these generalprogrammes.   In settling the details very considerable weight would beplaced on the social importance of plantings in certain areas of Scotlandand Wales, and the social service Ministers would be consulted aboutdevelopments in these areas and any similar areas in England.-1-C.(5S) 150 COPY NO.^15th July, 1958CAB [NET
5.     A planting programme for 1969 to 197 8 should be settled by a review to be undertaken in 1963, and thereafter reviews would be under-taken at ten-year intervals.Private Woodlands6.      We propose that the present policy of grants to private woodlandowners to encourage additional planting and good management by private owners should be continued;  and that the amount of these grants shouldbe increased for the present on lines already tentatively agreed by the forestry Commission with the private woodland owners.7.      The main empaasi.  would continue to be on the dedicated wood-land scheme.   The maintenance grant at present paid under this scheme would be replaced by a management grant of greater value, particularly to the smaller estates.   A grant of one-third towards the cost of constructing and improving roads on dedicated estates would beintroduced for the next five years;  this would be subject to a limit of 50,000 in any one year.   The planting grants for approved woodlandswould be raised to the same level as on dedicated estates.   The smallwoods grant would be continued.8.     Against these increases we propose to abolish a number of smaller grants - the poplar-planting, thinning and scrub clearance.And more important we propose that in reviewing the rates of grant,account should in future be taken not only of trends in costs (as atpresent) but also of trends in receipts.   This should mean that therate of grant - for planting as well as maintenance - will eventually(in, say, 20-30 years&apos; time) become nominal.9.      We would not propose to fix any final date for admission to thededicated woodlands scheme.   The position should be reviewed in fiveyears1 time.   At the same time the general structure of grants to private owners - including the small woods grant - should also be reviewed.10.    The higher grants to private woodland owners will be conditional on the formation of a satisfactory organisation representing privatewoodland owners in order to increase the efficiency of production and marketing on the private estates.   The additional cost of these highergrants is included in the Forestry Commission estimates for the current year.Felling Licences11.     We propose that the present system of felling licences should in the main be continued, both to prevent the exploitation of woodlandswhich would afterwards be left derelict, and because the licensingprocedure is preferable to wholesale use of tree preservation ordersby planning authorities.12.    We think, however, that it is no longer necessary to fix annualquotas for the amount of felling.   We propose also that in futurelicences should not be required for felling in dedicated woodlands,where good management is already ensured, and that licences should begranted freely for clear felling, selective felling and thinning elsewhere-2-
except where the effect would be to allow exploitation and yet makereplanting unenforceable.   Licences would be granted subject to a requirement to restock (either by planting or by natural regeneration)except, for example, where the land was to be used for agriculture or where planning permission had been given for a change of use.   Weare still in consultation with the Minister of Housing about the licences for felling hedgrow timber.   The effect of these changes would be tomake the licensing system less onerous than it is at present.Announcement13.     The main conclusions set out above would be announced in astatement in both Houses of Parliament.   The organisation representingprivate woodland owners should be informed in confidence of thedecision in relation to grants immediately before the general announce-ment was made in Parliament.   The announcement should be made before the recess.J.S.M.J.H.14th July, 1958Draft Statement on Forestry PolicyIn accordance with the statement made in the House of lords in October, 1957, the Government have carried out a review of forestrypolicy.   In the light of current conditions - strategic, economic,agricultural and social - they have reached the following conclusions.Forestry Commission2.      The planting programmes of the Forestry Commission shouldbe fixed for periods often years atia time.   For the five-year period1959 to 1963 the programme will be about 300,000 acres, roughly thesame rate as over the last five years.   For the period 1964 to 1968the planting programme will be reduced to about 235,000 acres sinceby then production from the Forestry Commissions existing plantationswill become increasingly heavy.   The size of the subsequentprogrammes should be reviewed in five years&apos; time.   In decidingwhere planting shall take place special attention will be paid to thesocial benefits of the expansion of forestry particularly inScotland and Wales.Private Forestry3.      The Government propose to continue their support to privatewoodland owners, particularly through the dedication scheme.   Thepresent maintenance grant of 5s. 6d. per acre will be replaced bya management grant of 18s. Od. per acre on the first 100 acres, lZs. Od.per acre on the next 100 acres, and 7s. Od. per acre on the remainder.This will substantially increase the value of the grants, particularly on the smaller woodlands.   Secondly, for the next five years a grantof one-third of the approved cost of constructing and improving roads-3-
on dedicated estates will be paid, subject to a total expenditure of 50,000 in any one year.   Thirdly, the planting grant for approved wood-lands will be raised from  8. 10s. Od. to  17.0s.0d. per acre.   Theseincreased grants are contingent on the formation of an effectiveWoodland Owners&apos; Association as recommended by the WatsonCommittee.   Fourthly, the grants for thinning, scrub clearance andpoplar planting will be terminated.   The new structure of grants willbe reviewed in five years&apos; time.   In reviewing in future years the levelof grants consideration will be given not only to trends in costs butalso to trends in receipts.   As production from private woods - andthus the income of private owners - rises, the level of assistanceneeded by way of planting and management grants will fall.   Eventually -in, say, 20-30 years1 time - it may well become nominal.Felling Licences4.      The system of felling licences will be continued.   In presentcircumstances it does not seem necessary to continue to fix a quota for the total annual felling but the licensing system will be continuedthough with some relaxations.   A statutory instrument will be made sothat fellings in dedicated woodlands /and felling of hedgerow trees^/7will no longer require a licence.   The powers of local planning authoritiesto make Tree Preservation Orders under the Planning Acts will not beaffected.   In addition, licences will in general be freely granted forother fellings subject to the existing arrangements for consultationwith planning authorities.   In order, however, to provide against theundesirable exploitation of woodland areas the licences will normallyhave a condition attached requiring restocking.   And licences forthinning or selective felling will not be granted where they would ineffect permit exploitation without restocking.Home Grown Timber trade.      The Government recognise the importance to the forestryindustry of an efficient home grown timber trade.   They believe thatthe measures just announced will be welcomed by the Trade as wellas by woodland owners, and will help both to plan ahead with confidence.This depends on the outcome of our discussions with theMinister of Rousing.-4-
