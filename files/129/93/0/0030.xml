Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 130 Copy No.20th June, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum ey the Minister of Pensions and National insurance agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he says in C. (58) 128 that the inquiries which we have recently conducted on pensions support a case for the publication of a White Paper. His suggestion that such a White paper should set out alternative plans is, I think, more doubtful. A decision to proceed in this way would make it unlikely that legislation could be ready for enactment inthe present Parliament. The disadvantages which would flow from this are setout in paragraph 7 (iii) of the Home Secretary&apos;s paper, C. (58) 123, and any relief to the Exchequer would be postponed until well into the 60&apos;s.2. It may, therefore, be helpful if I set out some comments first on the resultof the consultations recently undertaken and then on the broad merits of the matter.Results of Confidential Inquiry3. Paragraph 3 of C. (58) 128 could give a somewhat misleading impression of the results of the inquiry which has been undertaken. For example, it appears from paragraphs 3 and 4 of the annex to the Home Secretary&apos;s paper reporting theconclusions of the Ministerial Committee (C. (58) 123), that of the individual employers who expressed a view on the principle of contracting out, five were infavour and two against. It equally appears that of those who answered the specificquestion as to their own intentions, twelve desired to contract out, while elevendid not. It is perhaps worth pointing out that two of the Chairmen who replied tothe effect that they would wish to contract out were Lords Chandos and Monckton.4. But though it is possible to argue about the precise interpretation to beplaced on the replies of a certain number of the employers whom we selected for consultation, it is perhaps of rather greater significance that the two representative bodies the British Employers Confederation and the Trades Union Congress(T.U.C.) both wish to see contracting out. It is worth noting that this wish ofthe T.U.C. is expressed as distinct from their further wish that contracting out should be on an individual basis. The Chairmen of the nationalised industries, with one doubtful exception, all favour the provision of contracting out. And the LifeOffices would now like to see contracting out provided, if this could be done withoutsacrificing their other objectives.5. This predominance of view in favour of the provision for facilities for contracting out does not, however, indicate that the right would be exercised sofully as to undermine the financial attractions of the scheme. For it appears onthe basis of our sample that the number of people likely to be contracted out wouldbe, if anything, rather smaller than the one-third of those within the appropriateearnings field on which the calculations in earlier papers and in paragraph 11 of theChancellor^ paper are based. The result, therefore, of our inquiries leads to theconclusion that there is a clear demand for the opportunity to contract out, whichcan be met without, in practice, sacrificing the financial advantages for theExchequer of the new scheme.SECRET53616 b
?3M  JThe Merits6. As between Schemes A and B, a major advantage of A and, in my view,disadvantage of B, is that contracting out is possible under A and impossibleunder B.7. As the Cabinet know, I attach great importance to this. The underlyingprinciple here is that it is not in accordance with our political and social philosophyfor the State to take over or replace activities which are being satisfactorilyperformed by private enterprise. Apart from restoring the financial position, theobject of an extension of State insurance should be to make provision for thosewho, without it, will not enjoy the benefits of pensions related to a modest levelof wages. The present division into &quot; two nations &quot; is felt strongly, and there is arespectable case for the State acting to bring up those left behind to a position inwhich they will be enabled to enjoy something of the benefits already accruing to that more favoured section who are within the scope of private pension schemes. Butto go further than this and to force on people State provision in lieu of that alreadyadequately made for them by their employers and by themselves representsprecisely that extension of State activity and process of equalisation which has,in the judgment of many of us, been the defect of much post-war social legislation.The elimination of the Friendly Societies from National Insurance, and thesubmerging of many excellent voluntary hospitals in the National Health service are examples of a process in which too much respect was paid to the tidiness andegalitarian philosophy of universality and compulsion as compared with the vitalityand variety of self-help and individualism. And it is quite clear from the replieswe have received from employers in the course of our recent confidential inquiriesthat such an extension as is contemplated by either the August scheme (or the september one in so far as there was not contracting out) would involve substantial reductions in private occupational provision for old age, with a consequent reduction in saving and investment.8. The Chancellor states, without arguing it, that Scheme B has &quot; a betterbenefit structure.&quot; I do not agree. On the contrary, whereas Scheme A offersadditional benefits unsubsidised and related exactly to additional contributions,Scheme B has a redistributive effect, which is criticised by Lord Chandos in his reply on behalf of the Associated Electrical Industries. I think this is a validcriticism of a provision in an insurance scheme. Although this provision has beentoned down, it still persists in the shape of the withdrawal altogether of theExchequer contribution from the man whose earnings reach  15 a week whereasit is paid in full to the man at  8 a week with the consequence that the lowercontribution of the lower paid brings in a substantially disproportionate pensionwhen compared with the higher contribution of the higher paid. There exists, inmy view, already through our fiscal system too large an element of redistributionfor our social and economic health. I think it would be a pity to extend it to national Insurance. For here redistribution operates only on earned income, which our fiscal system quite rightly seeks to favour, and unlike our fiscal system it herepays no attention to family circumstances. In the August scheme redistribution,therefore, operates in favour of low earnings alone regardless alike of the unearnedincome or family responsibilities of those whose earnings it forcibly redistributes.There is the further reflection that the introduction of this element of redistributivetaxation into the National Insurance Scheme must in some measure diminish thepotency of the insurance concept, i.e., that contributions and benefits are matchedand that benefits depend solely on contributions paid. Social policy apart, to undermine further the insurance concept under which at the moment some 850 millions a year are raised outside the taxation system may have very realfinancial dangers.9. I also regard the treatment of the self-employed by Scheme B (they are excluded from the graduated provision of Scheme A) as quite unacceptable. It is part of the philosophy of the September Plan and its predecessor the May Plan that those who employ labour can properly be called upon to make some contribution towards the maintenance of that labour&apos;s old age. On this principlethere is much to be said for the introduction of an element of graduation incontribution and pension. But there is by no means a similar case for compellingthe self-employed man to make graduated provision for his old age. There is thereneither the element of employer responsibility nor of compulsory provision forbasic need only. The inclusion in the August Plan of the self-employed seems to
derive more from a desire for universality than from any clearly thought out socialconcept. There is very little real justification for compelling, as it proposes, a self-employed man earning  15 a week to contribute more than  la week. Hemay well desire to spend this proportion of his income in some other way, forexample, in the bringing up of his children, the development of a business on whichhe hopes to live in his old age, or even on a private insurance policy such as hasbeen facilitated by the 1956 Finance Act.10. The Chancellor recognises that it is necessary in considering legislation of this nature to reflect on the basis which it might provide for subsequent changesby a Government of another colour. A universal compulsory State schemecomplete with the full machinery for collection of contributions on a wage-related&apos;basis would be very convenient for a Government which desired to build upsomething on the scale and lines of the Grossman proposals. There would be verylittle difficulty in stepping up the ceilings and contributions, particularly theExchequer contribution of the August Plan, to Crossman levels; and the speedwith which this could be done would, of course, be greatly increased if such legislation were already on the Statute Book and in course of administrativepreparation. It is equally the case that if contracting out is not provided for fromthe beginning of any new development of this kind it would be extraordinarilydifficult to insert it later. There is a point of view that either under the August orSeptember schemes the level of contribution and benefit is such as to make&quot; peaceful co-existence &quot; without contracting out possible between the State and private occupational schemes. I do not, particularly on the evidence now beforeus from industry, share that view, but I think it was held by one or two of mycolleagues. It is in this connection worth reflecting that the force of that argumentdepends entirely on the State scheme being permanently kept at a low level bothof contributions and benefits and that enactment of the August scheme wouldprovide an easy mechanism for people of other views greatly to extend bothcontributions and benefits.I note that in paragraph 15 of C. (58) 128, the Chancellor indicates that this isin his view one of Scheme B*s advantages. But in the event of such increases thereis no doubt that the absence of contracting out provisions would spell notmodification but death for a large number of private schemes and so for muchprivate saving and investment. On the other hand, once contracting out were introduced it would be extremely difficult for any Government to make a frontalattack on it. But if we abandon it in our scheme, we would not be able effectively to criticise our opponents if they do so too. And having regard to the plaindifficulties of introducing it into a plan of their type subsidised and redistributivelike a bigger Scheme B they may well do so.11. There are two other points on the Chancellors paper which requirecomments:  (a) While it is true, as is said in paragraph 5 of C. (58) 128, that those (by nomeans only smaller firms), who do not contract out will be helping theExchequer, it is quite wrong to assume that they are thereby penalisedby being made to shoulder a heavier burden than the firms that docontract out. The firms which choose to contract out have to pay forthe cost of their own occupational schemes; and the employer will beable to choose which course suits him best. And those that do not willbe paying only an amount required to cover their share of their employees&apos; additional pension.(b) Paragraph 3 of C. (58) 128 refers to experience at the time the Americanscheme was started twenty years ago. The circumstances, however, werehardly analogous with those now facing us. The Americans h ad no existing fiat-rate scheme to consider, and the proposed graduated contributions was in the form of a social security tax. There can be nocontracting out of a tax, and, indeed, the American constitution forbidsselective taxation of persons similarly placed. In so far as Scheme Bcontains an element of taxation (as it does, both in respect of theNational Health Service and its redistributive principle) I would agreethat the American experience has a certain relevance; but Scheme A isspecifically designed to retain the taxation elements in the universalflat-rate contribution, and to exclude them from the graduated contributions, thus avoiding precisely the difficulty which the Americansencountered twenty years ago, when they decided to reject contracting out.SECRET53616 b 2
Finance12. The prospective cost to the Exchequer of the present National Insurancescheme is (on the same assumed level of unemployment as underlies the figures given for Schemes A and B in paragraph 11 of C. (58) 128) as follows:    millions1960-61      1965-66      1970-71      1980-81      2000-01211 298 387 528 533It is clear, therefore, that the Exchequer will benefit very substantially whicheverof the proposed new schemes may be adopted. Because of this, and having regardto the admitted uncertainties underlying the longer-term forecasts, I see no reasonto depart from the view that the choice between the two Plans should be based on political and social arguments, rather than on purely financial grounds.13. I think that the Chancellor does not dissent from the view that the september Scheme does afford substantial and acceptable relief to the exchequer for the next decade or two to a degree not decisively inferior (and indeed, in theearliest years, superior) to that afforded by the August Scheme. It is lookingbeyond and beneath this that he claims substantial financial advantages for the august Scheme with its flexible concept of basic benefit. I myself see even greaterdangers in this. It abandons the well-defined and established safeguard (which isin the existing Scheme and in the September Scheme) that the universal state scheme, carrying the State subsidies and implicit guarantees against inflation, is confined to benefits at a uniform flat rate near subsistence level. It thus opens upthe way under inevitable political pressures to unlimited enlargement of Stateresponsibility for wage related benefits, with consequent enlargement of publicconcepts of the duties of the State, which could not fail to be highly inflationary.14. The Chancellor also sees advantage in the prospect that the AugustScheme might be able to accommodate graduated short-term benefits (e.g., sickness and unemployment benefit). I see profound disadvantage in the prospect that theScheme, by political pressures resulting from the nature of its conception (graduatedbasic benefits), would speedily be compelled to accommodate graduated short-term benefits with early adverse financial consequences and very serious administrativeimplications. The September Scheme with its preservation of the basic as a flat rate structure and its graded element confined to pensions on an unsubsidised, value for money, basis is much better proofed against such a development.15. Paragraph 13 of C. (58) 128 expresses doubt whether we could maintainthe 3 per cent, rate of interest on which the graduated scale of pension has been calculated under the September Scheme. But even if a higher rate had to be conceded, the extra cost would emerge very slowly: on the basis of a 34- per cent,rate the additional cost would be:    millions1960-61      1965-66      1970-71      J980-81      2000-010 0 1 4 27The Chancellor also refers to possible repercussions on the basic flat rate contribution, if a higher rate of interest is adopted for the graduated contribution,but in practice enlargement of the &quot; overload &quot; in the basic contribution has not proved to be a matter of political difficulty. I had very little trouble over this when this session&apos;s National Insurance Bill substantially increased the overload.16. The Chancellor^ paper, therefore;- states that if occupational schemesgrow, there will be more contracting out, and that the figures make no allowance for this. The figures do in fact make a reasonable allowance for a growth in thenumbers of individuals contracted out of the State scheme, and as I have already indicated, assume a rather higher initial level of contracting out than seems likelyto occur in the light of our inquiries.Conclusion17. But quite apart from the abstract merits of the two Plans, it seems to me tobe quite unrealistic to suppose that it is, at this stage, politically practicable to adoptany solution which excludes the right to contract out. In the faofcof the naturalinclinations of our own people and of the fact that the Opposition scheme the
Crossman Plan itself purports to allow contracting out to those who have the cover of satisfactory private schemes, the only argument which could be effectively used against permitting contracting out would be that it is either unworkable or that therewould be no demand for it. Whatever the validity of these arguments they are notin the light of what has happened now open to us. We have consulted a considerablenumber of people on the likelihood of their contracting out on the basis that this is practicable and many have indicated that they would wish to take advantage of it.Indeed, if it were impracticable, we would have been simply wasting their time in asking them these questions. We are therefore, in my view, quite clearly debarred from relying on arguments either of impracticability or of no demand, in any public controversy on this issue at this stage.18. It seems to me therefore that considerations of principle and expediencyproduce the conclusion that any scheme we bring forward must include provisionfor contracting out. That does not, of course, compel us to accept Scheme A as it stands; there are a number of important points for consideration and on which theviews of informed opinion might well be obtained through the medium of a white paper.J.
