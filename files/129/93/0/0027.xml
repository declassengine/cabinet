Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 127 Copy No.  (J 018th June, 1958CABINETWORLD YOUTH FESTIVALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsProblemWhat should be the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the next WorldYouth Festival which will be held in Vienna in July 1959?background. World Youth Festivals are held every few years under the auspices oftwo international Communist front organisations, the World Federation of democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, and have consistentlybeen used in the interests of Communist propaganda. The policy of these bodiesis to campaign for &quot; united action,&quot; to disguise their control from Moscow as faras possible and to acquire respectability by associating as many non-Communists aspossible with their activities and by holding their meetings outside the Soviet orbit.At the present time these organisations are particularly dangerous in their ability to confuse and exploit the desire of many people for peace and understanding.Their main and most vulnerable targets are young people from Asia and Africa.3. Hitherto Her Majesty&apos;s Government have regularly condemned thesefestivals and discouraged reputable organisations and individuals in this country from taking part. We have also played a leading role in exposing the festivalsabroad and in influencing other Governments against them.4. The last World Youth Festival took place in 1957 in Moscow. Wefollowed our established policy of discouragement and the public boycott inthis country was successful; but a number of non-Communists from this countrytook part in the Festival as individuals and some of them were confidentiallybriefed by the Foreign Office to enable them to speak up for the Western point ofview. They were not able to make much impact on other delegates or on thetightly organised programme of the Festival, but they made an impression on someof the ordinary inhabitants of Moscow. After the Festival a number of people,amongst them individual young Conservatives, criticised us for adopting a negative attitude towards non-Communists attending.5. The next Festival will take place in Vienna in July 1959. The fact thatthe Festival is being held outside the Soviet orbit makes it appear more respectableand is therefore a propaganda advantage for the Communists. It makes activecounter-measures by us easier; but the impact of non-Communist delegates onthe local population (valuable in Moscow or Prague) loses much of its point.conclusion 6. In the light of the foregoing I am inclined to think that the policy ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government towards the next Festival should be to denounce it as hitherto and to advise reputable organisations against participating; but that we53602
Foreign Office, S.W.1,17th June, 1958.should be rather less discouraging to young people who for a variety of reasonswish to go as individuals.7. If my colleagues agree with this policy it is for consideration whether Ishould make a statement to this effect in the form of a reply to a parliamentary question. That was done last time nine months before the Conference was held.I would also suggest that the Commonwealth and Colonial Secretaries and I should communicate the text of any statement to overseas Governments and authorities as appropriate, some time before it is made. .S.
