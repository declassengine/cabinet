W.l.22nd May, 1958
ICELANDIC FISHERY LIMITSDraft of a Declaration to be made by Her M&amp;jesfo &apos;s GovernmentOn 23rd May, the Icelandic Government issuedFishery Regulations based on a decision to extend Icelandicfishery limits to twelve miles from baselines adjusted inlceiand&apos;s favour (s.e note).20 /This is a decision by one Government which infx-ingesand socks to restrict the rights of many other nations.     the fishing grounds affected by the new Icelandic regulations have always been part of the high seas and are of the greatest importanceto the United Kingdom.     We have fished there continuously over along period.    A substantial proportion of the fish brought to ourshores ccmes from there, and the Icelandic regulations v/ould belikely to deprive us of as much as half the fish we catch in theneighbourhood of Icelr.nd.    This would have grave effects notonly on the economy of our fishing industry but also on th-&apos;continuance of supplies of fish to our people./3. Her Ms.jesty&apos;s Government cannot accept theRegulations issued unilaterally by the Icelandic Government on 23rdMay as having any legal effect under international law.     TheRegulations purpoTt to restrict the enjoyment on the high seasof the rights common to all nations;  and claims zo exercise suchexclusive jurisdiction in areas outside the normal limits of territorial waters are wholly unwarranted under international law.Further Her &apos;Majfcsty&apos;s Government do not recognise baselinesbeyond those permitted by international law.     They will, as always,seek to prevent unlawful interference with British fishing vessels on the  high seas, whether or nob such interference takes place within the area to which the Icelandic Government now claim tohave extended their exclusive jurisdiction in fishery matters.48 The proposed changes in the baselines in themselvesinvolve the ...clusiori of large areas of sea within Icelandic internalwaters, and a corresponding extension to a further area of the high seas of the twelve-mile zone within which exclusive jurisdiction in fishery matters is claimed by the Icelandic Government.     Thepresent adjustments of baselines by the Icelandic Government cannot,in the view of Her .Majesty!s Government, be said to be based on international law.NoteIf the Icelandic Regulations make any concessionwith regard to historic right.:, the declaration will have to besuitably amended.-1-
5t Her Majesty&apos;s Government are, as they were before the Icelandic Government made these Regulations, readyto enter into negotiations with a view to securing a permanent solution of the fishery problems in the region of Iceland.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are aware of the importance of fisheries to Iceland.     Fisheries are also of great importancetc the United Kingdom.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe thatin the course of negotiations it should be possible to reachwithout much delay a solution acceptaole to both countries.6. Her Majesty&apos;? Government and a number ofother Governments in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationhave done their utmost to persuade the Icelandic Government toenter into talks with a view to the negotiation of an appropriatefisheries pgreement and toabstainfrom unilateral action.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to enter into suchtalks in the spirit of compromise and goodwill that they showedduring the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea.
