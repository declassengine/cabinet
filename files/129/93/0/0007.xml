SECRET v 4 0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.  XCABINETICELAND;   PROTECTION OF BRITISH FISHING VESSELSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 13th May the Cabinet (C.C.(58) 41st Conclusions, Minute 4)invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the Minister ofAgriculture and the First Lord of the Admiralty, to circulate, as amatter of urgency, a memorandum on the protection of British vesselswithin any area of the high seas over which the Icelandic government might unilaterally claim exclusive fishery rights.Numbers of British fishing vessels involved2.   On the fishing side, the basic facts are these.   The British deep-sea trawlers fish around Iceland throughout the year.   There are larger numbers of vessels there at some times of the year than at others,depending upon the season and the fluctuations of the fish stocks there and elsewhere.   At any one time the number of British trawlers offIceland may vary between 30 and 120.   Sometimes the vessels will be fairly well concentrated in particular areas and sometimes they will bewell scattered.   The fishing grounds around Iceland are widely spacedand British fishing operations are of an individualistic character.   all this means that at most times protection would be required over wide areas, unless the fishing industry agreed to concentrate its activities in a small number of groups.   The circumference of Iceland is1,000 miles or so.Strength of Icelandic and British fishery protection services .   On the naval side the position is as follows:-(1)  Icelandic fishery protection force.   This consists of:-(a)   Surface vessels(i)    THOR - specially constructed vessel of 700 tons,maximum speed 18 knots - armed with one 57 mm. gun.(ii)    AEGIR - converted trawler with top speed of about14 knots - armed with one 57 mm. gun.(iii)    Four converted 125 ft. motor fishing vessels eacharmed with one 47 mm. gun.C(58) 10714th May, 1958

(b) Aircraft- (i)    One Catalina - in February, 1956, no armament wasfitted, although side-arms were carried.   It is under-stood that armament including bombs could be fittedand that the Icelandic Government is negotiating forthe procurement of suitable automatic guns for mountingin the aircraft.(ii)    One or two light aircraft of the Auster type which areunarmed and are considered incapable of effecting anarrest without assistance.(iii)    Other civilian aircraft have been chartered to assistcoastguard forces.(Z)   British forces(a) R.N. fishery protection ships the total available number of ships capable of operating inIcelandic waters is two frigates and two ocean minesweepers.Two of these could be made available for a prolonged period at any given time, and three for a limited period but only at the expenseof other commitments.   Fuel is normally available at the Faroes;if, for any reason it were denied   to us, it would be necessary toprovide facilities for replenishment at sea.(b) Other R.N. forcesOther forces could be withdrawn from other commitments if the degree of priority were thought sufficient to do so.   The effect ofthis and of the proposals in (a) above are discussed in the Annex tothis memorandum.(c) Air forcesPatrolling around Iceland by Shackleton aircraft to assist theTask Unit is within the operational capabilities of the aircraft butthe task could not be undertaken by the Royal Air Force for lengthyperiods without detriment to its normal commitments.4.   The normal single-ship patrols which the Fishery ProtectionSquadron of the Royal Navy carries out in Icelandic waters would be ineffective in giving support to the British trawling fleet on account of the size of the Icelandic Fishery Patrol Force and the length of the coastline.A Task Unit of at least three ships would be required to give adequatesupport and even then the British trawlers would need to be reasonably well concentrated.   To provide for fully effective protection there would need to be six vessels to shadow each of the Icelandic fishery protectionvessels, though it is unlikely that all six of these Icelandic vessels wouldbe operational at the same time.-2-
Possible courses of action5.   The courses of action open would be:-Course A -   Preventive action by a Task Unit, such as shadowingIcelandic gunboats and broadcasting to British trawlers their positions and courses, or lying off suitable headlands on the flanks of concentrations of British trawlers to warn them of the approach of an Icelandic gunboat.Our trawlers would then have to steam out of the disputed waters to avoidarrest.Course. B - Adoption of a policy of passive resistance wherebytrawler crews would refuse to obey Icelandic instructions or to co-operate with Icelandic boarding parties in taking arrested vessels to port.   It is most unlikely, however, that resistance by trawler crews would remainpassive for long.Course C -   Physical obstruction by a Task Unit of the Icelandicgunboats when attempting to effect arrest in the disputed waters.   Thepresence of one of H.M. ships might deter the gunboat without having to resort to physical obstruction.   These tactics could not be employed againstIcelandic aircraft attempting to make arrests but the latter could not, inany case, assume control of any vessels they were attempting to arrest.6.   Course A is practicable but would in a sense be yielding to the icelandic claim.   Course B, although theoretically possible, would giverise to the danger of serious incidents.   This leaves Course C, the effectiveness of which would be dependent upon prior co-operationensuring that the Task Unit was in the right place at the right time andthat British trawlers were reasonably well concentrated in a particular area or areas.   The trawlers would refuse obedience to any Icelandicgunboat or aircraft, would continue fishing and would seek to avoid beingboarded or taken into port.   If the Icelandic gunboat made an attempt to effect an arrest, one of H.M. ships would then intervene, but without openingfire.   The policy would be for the fishery protection vessel to attempt toplace herself between the Icelandic gunboat and the trawler in orderphysically to prevent an arrest being made.   Trawlers fishing individually and far apart around the Icelandic coasts could not however be saved from arrest in this way.7.   There are two main weaknesses in this policy.   Firstly, a fishery protection vessel might not reach the trawler concerned in time, and might find an Icelandic boarding party in possession of the trawler before itcould intervene.   The captain of H.M. ship would then be faced with the choice of using forcible means to regain possession of the trawler or of taking no action.   Secondly, there is always the possibility that theIcelanders would not be deterred by obstructive tactics and would use force to make an arrest.   The view of the Admiralty is that in such circumstances the commanders of fishery protection vessels should have discretion to use sufficient force to carry out what would be the declared policy of preventing the arrest of British vessels.   They should not,however, use force until it had been used by the Icelanders.-3-
8.   So far as the fishing industry are concerned, they would not only have to be prepared to co-operate with H.M. ships but they would also have to realise that an inevitable outcome of this policy would be thatthey would be unable to enter Icelandic ports in the evert of emergency,for food, fuel or repairs.conclusions .   Provided that H.M. ships are authorised to use force as necessary,and that the fishing industry is willing to co-operate, it is consideredthat Course C would offer a high degree of protection.   It must berecognised, however, that in an extreme case this policy might resultin the sinking of an Icelandic gunboat.10. The essential requirements to implement a policy of resisting arrest of British fishing vessels would be:-(a) A Task Unit would need to be sent to Icelandic waters and remainthereuntil a settlement was reached.   To give adequate support itwould need to include at least three ships.(b) Trawler owners would need to be requested to instruct their vessels to co-operate in every way with H.M. ships and to fish within the disputed waters only where protection was available.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.14th May, 1958ANNEXIMPLICATIONS OF REINFORCING THE FISHERY PROTECTIONPATROLS OF ICELANDThe implications of reinforcing the fishery protection patrols of iceland in the period up to the end of September are discussed below.Capabilities of Fishery Protection Squadron2.   It would be possible, without reinforcing the four ships of the fishery Protection Squadron capable of operating in Icelandic waters, tomaintain a patrol of two ships for a prolonged period of three ships for ashort period if a stronger show of force were considered necessary.To do this adequate facilities for replenishment at sea would have to bemade available.   This can be done.   Even a patrol on this scale could notbe met without the sacrifice of other commitments.-4
SECRET 4 43.   The Fishery Protection Squadron has a purely naval role as a mine-sweeping and anti-submarine force.   If it is required to provide patrolsoff Iceland on an increased scale, it would not be possible to carry outthe Squadron&apos;s annual training period between 5th and 16th July and theefficiency of the ships of the Squadron as warships would be correspondinglyimpaired.   These ships would also be unable to take part in the followingexercises:-(a) COVER POINT - Z4th June to 5th July.(b) FORTHRIGHT - 16th to 19th July.(c) SHIPSHAPE - 18th to 26th September.Of these, COVER POINT is a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)minesweeping exercise and the effect would be to withdraw the whole ofthe fleet minesweeping contribution.   FORTHRIGHT is a national exercise,which is less important, though the effect would also be to withdraw theentire minesweeping component.   SHIPSHAPE is the main annual N.A.T.O.exercise.Additional forces available in emergency4.   If the degree of priority is considered to be sufficiently high, a force from the Home Fleet of up to two cruisers, one fast minelayer or thirteendestroyers or frigates could be made available.   In order to do this itwould be necessary to cancel proposed visits to foreign ports by some ofH.M. ships and also to withdraw additional ships from some or all of the-following N.A.T.O, exercises:-(a) GREAT DANE - 16th to 19th June.(b) COVER POINT - 24th June to 5th July.(c) FRESH WIND - 29th June to 8th July.(d) SHIPSHAPE - 18th to 26th September.5.   The effect of withdrawing ships of the Fishery Protection Squadronfrom the exercises mentioned in paragraph 3 is probably acceptable.   TheUnited Kingdom has, however, been under pressure to honour her commit-ments to N.A.T.O. and it would undoubtedly be difficult to withdraw ships of the Home Fleet from the exercises mentioned in paragraph 4.Presumably the maximum contribution which the Home Fleet would becalled upon to make would be to provide a total of four ships to reinforce the two available ships of the Fishery Protection Squadron so that enoughH.M. ships were available to shadow each of the six Icelandic fisheryenforcement vessels.   If it were necessary to sustain this commitment for a prolonged period it would mean, in practice, that probably sevenships of the Home Fleet would have to be earmarked in order to make sure that four were permanently operational.6.   A commitment of this size would disorganise the training of theFleet to a serious extent as well as causing serious embarrassment in thewithdrawal from international exercises that would be necessary..
