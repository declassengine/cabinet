C.(58) 12517th June, 1958COPY NO.CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SALARY CLAIMSMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of education on 11th June the Committee on Wages Policy invited us(W.P.(58) 2nd Meeting) to circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum seeking a decision on the action to be taken in the event of either a negotiatedagreement or an arbitration award giving some increase in salariesto teachers in Scotland.2.      In England and Wales, and also in Scotland, teachers&apos; salariesare negotiated between representatives of local authorities and of teachers, the Burnham Committee and the National Joint Council.   in both cases the salaries recommended by the Committee or Councilrequire the approval of the Minister or the Secretary of State before they become effective.   In England the Minister can only accept orreject the advice of the Burnham Committee.   In Scotland the Secretaryof State can also, if he wishes, modify the recommendations made to him.The other chief difference between the two countries is that in Englandthere is no provision for arbitration if the two sides of the burnham committee fail to agree.   In Scotland, however, there is provision for arbitration, and the arbitrators&apos; decision then automatically becomesthe recommendation of the Council.The situation in Scotland3.      The current salary scales in Scotland have been in force from november 1956, and when they were approved the National Joint council were informed that, unless there were a major change in circumstances,these scales would remain unchanged until 31st March, 1960.    scottish teachers lodged a claim on 14th March, 1958, in the National Joint council for a 7 per cent increase on basic scales to compensate for a 6 per centrise in the cost of living since November 1956, and a 1 per cent increasein the liability of teachers for superannuation payments.   The claim,if granted in full, would cost in a complete year some  2 millions,of which the Exchequer would bear  1. 2 millions.   The Local AuthoritySide are expected to make knowntheir attitude to the claim whennegotiations open on Wednesday, 27th June.   The present state of theEducation (Scotland) Fund is such as to make the proposed increasepossible, and there is some reason to believe that the Local AuthoritySide may be prepared to offer an increase of, say, 3 or 4 per cent.If the Teachers&apos; Side were to accept this, the Secretary of State would receive a recommendation from the Council about the end of this month.If, however, the Local Authority Side did not make an offer, or if theTeachers1 Side rej ected any offer they made, the Teachers1 Side might take the matter to arbitration.-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
4.      To have to reject a recommendation of the Council, whetherreached by agreement or as a result of arbitration, would be embarrassat a time when the problem of the supply of teachers is causing   particulconcern, and it would be represented as indicating a failure on the partof the Government to appreciate tho seriousness of the problem.   On theother hand, it could be fairly argued - although the teachers would nodoubt argue to the contrary - that a rise in the cost of living of theorder of 6 x^er cent cannot be regarded as &quot;a major change in circum-stances&quot;.     Moreover, Government policy has been to resist wage increases in the public sector, and particularly those based solely on rises in the cost of living, where the wages have been fixed, as inthe present case, later than September, 1956,The situation in England and Wales5.      In the negotiations leading up to the jJurnham scales now currentthe teachers were unwilling to include the normal recommendation thatthe scales should operate for a period of three years.   The Minister,however, knowing that he had the support of the local authorities onthe point, made it clear t!-at his approval would be given on theassumption that, in the absence of some major change in circumstances,the new scales would continue in force for the normal three-year period.   As things stand at present, the Authorities&apos; Panel of theBurnhazn Committee will almost certainly not accept the increase ?&apos;nthe cost of living which has actually occurred as a &quot;major change in circumstances&quot;.    If they were to do so, the Minister would be amplyjustified in rejecting any proposal for an immediate increase byrelying on the statement which he made when the present scales were approved.    A new situation would, of course, be created, both for theauthorities and for the Minister, if a cost of living increase had beenapproved for Scottish teachers.    Appendix A gives details of thecircumstances in which interim increases have been conceded in thepast in both countries.6.      The English teachers have not, in fact, claimed an increasebased primarily on the cost of living, but have asked the Authorities&apos;Panel of the Burnham Committee for an early meeting to negotiatecompletely new scales.   Their claim will be for a new basic scale ofthe order of  600 to  1,200 for non-graduates - an increase of25 per cent at minimum and 33 per cent at maximum on the present scale, with corresponding increases in allowances and additions forgraduates.   If, however, they were to get a 7 per cent increase such asthe Scottish teachers have asked for, the cost for England and wales would be about  18 millions, of which about  11 millions would fallon the Exchequer.Possible Statement by the Secretary of State to the Scottish national joint Council7.      On the instance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State has in mind when answering the National Joint Council&apos;senquiry as to whether the state of the Education (Scotland) Fund is such as to make some increase possible, to remind the Council of theGovernments general attitude to pay claims as indicated in theChancellor&apos;s Budget statement.   He would also remind the Councilof the conditions under which the current rates were approved in 1956.-2-
A draft of the proposed letter is attached.    The most that could beexpected from this, however, would be that the Local Authority Sidemight be deterred from making an offer.   It would almost certainly notdeter the teachers from pressing their claim, and the only result ofsuch an intervention might be that the Secretary of State would receive a recommendation for an increase based on arbitration instead of anagreement.   Ir the event of arbitration, it might also be represented that the effect of his intervention was to prejudice the arbitration. &apos;There would also be awkward   repercussions in England.     TheMinister would almost certainly be involved in making somecorresponding statement to the Burnham Committee which would be criticised as unwarranted interference with their negotiations and,for the reasons given in paragraph 5, would do more harm than good.8. There is at present no issue calling for decision inEngland, but the Cabinet is asked to decide in the light of theinformation in this paper:-(a) what line the Secretary of State should take if he receivesa recommendation for an immediate increase in the salaries of Scottish teachers as a result either of&quot;agreement in the National Joint Council or ofarbitration;   (paragraphs 3 and 4)(b) whether, in answering the National Joint Council&apos;senquiry about the availability of moneys in theEducation (Scotland) Fund, the Secretary of state should add a statement on the lines of the attached draft (Appendix B).J.M.G.E.16th June, 1958
APPENDIX AINTERIM INCREASES IN TEACHERS&apos; SALARIESEngland and wales the only occasion on which an interim increase was agreed by the Burnham Committee was in July, 1952.2.      In March, 1952, when the cost of living had risen by about11 per cent since April, 1951, the date of the last award, the Authorities&apos;Panel, who had turned down an earlier claim based on an 8 per cent increase in the cost of living, still felt unable to make any offer.    Butthey agreed that the Committee should seek the advice of threeindependent persons.   In April, 1952, when the cost of living had risen by a boat 12.5 per cent since April, 1951, thea.dvisersrecommendedadditions to salary equivalent tc an average increase of about 6 per cent.This was approved by the Minister in June, 1952, and came intooperation on 1st July, 1952.Scotland3.      A cost of living increase related to the same period as in Englandand Wales and of the same amounts was also given in Scotland from 1st August, 1952.4.      On 1st April, 1956, a 7 per cent interim increase was given inScotland to compensate for rising costs since the previous triennialreview on 1st April, 1954;  and  the date of the subsequent triennialreview, which had been advanced in England from 1st April, 1957, to 1st October, 1956, was in Scotland brought forward from 1st April, 1957,to 1st November, 1956.r   RECENT SALARY INCREASES TO SCOTTISH TEACHERSIncrease overprev:ous scales.(percentages)Triennial Review	-	1st April, 1951	28Interim Increase	-	1st August, 1952	6Triennial Review	-	1st April, 1954	9Interim Increases	-	1st April, 1956	10Triennial Review	-	1st November, 1956	13
APPENDIX draft LETTER for the Secretary of State&apos;s Assessor to send to:-The Hon. Joint Secretaries)National J&apos;unt Council to deal with salaries of Teachers in Scotland.I am directed to refer to the meeting of the Negotiating Committeeof the Council (Committees B and C) on 14th March at which information was requested   1 as to how far the cost of any interim increase which itmight be decided to award could be met from sums available in theEducation (Scotland) Fund&quot;.2.      As announced in Circular No. 156 dated 12th June, 1958 (copyenclosed), the rate of the rate-deduction in the education grant formulahas been reduced from 9d. to 6d. in respect of the financial year1958/59.   With the rate of the rate-deduction at this reduced level itwould still be possible in the financial year 1958/59 to meet from theFund the grant of 60 per cent ca an increase in teachers1 salarieswithin the limit of the present claim:   the increase could, of course, be operative for only part of that financial year, and its full effect wouldnot be felt until the following financial year.   The effect of the decreasein the rate of the rate-deduction will be that the amount of the rate-deduction, which would have been about  2,775,000 if the rate of therate-deduction had remained at 9d., will be about  1,850,000,representing a gain to the authorities of about  925,000.3.      In communicating this information I am asked by the Secretaryof State to say that the Committee and the Council will no doubtappreciate that the availability of moneys within the Education (Scotland)Fund is not the only matter for consideration in deciding whether torecommend to him an interim increase in teachers&apos; salaries.   Inparticular he would remind the Council that, as statedin the Departmentsletter of 3lst October, 1^56, the Regulations which came into effect onthe following day were made on the assumption that, unless there was a major change in circumstances, the scales incorporated in them would remain unchanged until 31st March, I960.   In his opinion no major change in the circumstances has arisen since then.4.      Moreover, on the general question of increases in salaries and wages in present circumstances, the Government^ view, as astatedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his budget speech to the Houseof Commons on 15th April is that wage increases in general cannot go beyond a national increase of productivity without damage to the generalnational interests of security of employment and the strength of the currency.   As the Chancellor has indicated it is too soon yet to contemplate any general relaxation in measures which the Governmenthave taken to curb inflation and to preserve the value of the pound.SICRET
