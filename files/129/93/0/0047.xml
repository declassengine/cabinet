SUGGESTED DRAFT OF INTRODUCTfRYPARAGRAPHWhen the present Government was formed, the Minister ofDefence was entrusted with the task of re-shaping and re-organising the Armed Forces in accordance with current strategic needs and inthe light of the economic capacity of the country.     For this purpose,the functions of the Minister of Defence in relation to the service departments and the Ministry of Supply were re-defined, and he wasgiven increased authority tc take decisions on matters of generaldefence policy affecting the s.?.e, shape, organisation and equipment ofthe Armed Forces.     This was announced in a statement made by thePrime Minister in the House of Commons on 24th January, 1957.This form of organisation has now been in operation foreighteen months.    As a result of a recent careful review the Govern-ment have concluded that the arrangements adopted at the beginningof 1957 have been justified by practical experience.    They have there-fore decided that, subject to certain minor alterations, these arrange-ments should now be formally confirmed.     In addition three newfeatures will be introduced.     First, the composition and operation ofthe Defence Committee of the Cabinet will be adjusted in order tosecure greater flexibility and efficiency.    Secondly, a Defence board will be set up to assist the Minister of Defence in formulating defence policy and for dealing with inter-Service problems.     Thirdly, certainadjustments in the Staff organisation will be made, including theassumption by the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee of the title of Chief of the Defence Staff;  these are designed to emphasise theimportance of the closest inter-Service co-operation and to ensurethat the fullest information and advice from the Service deparment is made available to the Minister of Defence.
SUGGESTED REVISE OF FARAGRAPHS 1 AND 21. The supreme responsibility for national defence rests with thePrime Minister and the Cabinet.    Subject to this, defence problems which engage the collective responsibility of the Government - especially those which are related to the Commonwealth and to Foreign and colonial policy - are normally handled on the Cabinefs behalf by theDefence Committee, which r.:eets under the Chairmanship of the PrimeMinister.     Experience has shown that, in view of their wide range and variety, these problems cannot conveniently be handled by a Committeeof fixed membership.    Therefore, in order to gain greater flexibility,the Committee will in future be so constituted as to allow the various types of problem which arise to be considered by the Ministers most directly concerned with them.     The following Ministers will be membersof the Committee:-Prime Minister    (Chairman)Home SecretaryForeign SecretaryChancellor of the ExchequerCommonwealth SecretaryColonial secretary minister of defence minister of Labour and National ServiceFirst Lord of the AdmiraltySecretary of State for war secretary of State for air minister of Supply.The Prime Minister will determine which of these members should attendparticular meetings of the Committee, according to the subjects to bediscussed and the Ministerial responsibilities involved.     In addition,other Ministers may on occasion be invited to attend meetings at whichmatters affecting the special interests of their Departments are to bediscussed.The Chiefs of Staff will be in attendance.     Papers and Minutesof meetings will be circulated to all members of the Committee.
SUGGESTED REVISE OF PARAGRAPHS 9 AND 109.        When a Service Minister or the Minister of Supply wishes tomake proposals on any matter affecting defence policy, as defined inparagraph 5 above, he will normally submit them to the Minister ofDefence.    This arrangement will not, however, prejudice their constitutional right to make submissions to the Cabinet and its committees.10.       Recommendations &quot;or the more important Service appointmentswill be submitted by the Service Ministers and the Minister of supply for the approval of the Minister of Defence who will, in appropriate cases, seek the covering approval of the Prime Minister.SUGGESTED REVISE OF PARAGRAPHS 17-19The Joint Planning Staff, in their collective capacity, will be directly responsible to the Chief of the Defence Staff as Chairman ofthe Chiefs of Staff Committee.     He will be entitled to call on therespective Chiefs of Staff to make available, to assist him in thedischarge of his functions, the services of the Naval, General andAir Staffs who will together be regarded as forming a Joint DefenceStaff.    For the study of inter-Service problems these Staffs will beresponsible, through the Chiefs of Staff of their respective Services,to the Chiefs of Staff Committee and through its Chairman to theMinister of Defence.PARAGRAPHS 2 0 AND 21O^mit both these paragraphs.
