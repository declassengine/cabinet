Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 128 Copy No.J8th June, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerOutside CommentsThe comments by those consulted clearly show that there is both room and demand for more public discussion and education on National Insurance reform.There is therefore a case for a White Paper which sets out alternative approaches and gives the facts and figures necessary for an informed public reaction to them.I would not regard this as necessarily a pusillanimous approach, though I quiterecognise the political arguments against it.2. If, however, we are now to make a final choice and commit ourselvespublicly to legislation next Session on one scheme or the other, then I think ourconsultations, partial and hurried though they were, strengthen the case for decidingin favour of the August Plan (Scheme B).3. The employers who prefer Scheme B are twice as numerous as those whoprefer Scheme A, and though some instinctively favour the idea of giving employersa right to contract their schemes out, it is clear that most employers, if weintroduced Scheme A, would not in fact exercise it; and that the Trades Union.Congress would oppose a scheme which left the initiative with the employersrather than individual employees. Few employers seem to have given muchprevious thought to the problems of contracting out, and it is noteworthy thatthose who have given most thought to it (together with the Life Offices association and the Association of Superannuation and Pension Funds, who were informallyconsulted many months ago) are those most inclined to think that it is impracticable. (It might be interesting to know the considered views of the institute of Actuaries, who are known to have been working hard on the technicalcomplexities.) In the United States it took about two years of intensive public discussion before a unanimous predilection for contracting out turned intoa unanimous conclusion that it was both unworkable and unnecessary.The comments we. have received give reason to believe that a similar processin this country would lead to the same result. It would seem to me to bevery unwise, on the basis of the replies before us, for the Government to commit themselves to legislation founded on the principle of contracting out. We shouldrisk a fiasco from which we should get nothing but discredit. At present this risklies with the Labour Party, whose scheme is unthinkable without contracting out:Moreover, having once conceded the principle, we might be driven into concedingthe right of &quot; individual &quot; contracting out.The General Issue4. No one seriously proposes that there should be a right either for groups orfor individuals to contract out of a universal basic scheme such as the present one.It is only if we follow the Labour plan, as Scheme A ddes, in converting thenational scheme from one limited-to basic provision to one which provides a wage.-related,scheme:on.top of a basic scheme, that the question.of contracting outarises., There; would be. widespread support; fox. the; view, that: the. State/scheme,should; as: in the United States and&apos;elsewhere, limit itself to basic.needs ;and leave:53605,
the rest to occupational schemes: if that principle is agreed, contracting out is clearlyinappropriate. Limitation to basic provision is the principle of Scheme B, thoughit recognises that basic needs are variable and not flat. There may be argumentas to whether it takes too ample a view of &quot; basic provision &quot; the Life Officesthink it about right but once the principle is accepted that can be looked at ifnecessary. Adherence to the &quot; basic provision&quot; principle is what limits thescheme&apos;s size as well as rendering it unsuitable for a contracting-out provision.Once one openly assigns to the State a role beyond basic provision (as doesScheme A), and allows the right to contract out of the upper tier, there is no solidreason for limiting the size of that role to the present limits of Scheme A, or indeedto any limits short of the Labour Party plan. These essential differences inprinciple between the two schemes were not, of course, brought out in the documentgiven to employers, since it was confined to a bare description.5. The replies show that if Scheme A were introduced, contracting out wouldbe mainly confined to public employers and big private employers. The majorityof private employers would not contract out, either because they cannot managean occupational scheme big enough to qualify, or because they are unwilling tosubmit their schemes to State control. (The point about surrender of sovereigntydoes not of course affect the public employers, because their schemes are alreadycontrolled by the Government or by statute.) The main purpose of introducingScheme A would be to relieve the Exchequer through the contributions of thosewho do not contract out. We should therefore have a situation in which the public services and nationalised industries had been able to excuse themselves fromhelping the Exchequer while the large majority of private employers found themselves unable to excuse themselves. This does not fit in very well with ourparty&apos;s principles.6. Scheme B, as compared with Scheme A, has a better benefit structure, ismuch sounder financially (a point elaborated below), is beyond doubtadministratively workable, involves no surrender of sovereignty by occupational schemes and would, I believe, be more acceptable to employers in general. It isbased on a clear and defensible political principle that the State should limit itsTole to an enlightened conception of basic needs and trench no further than thaton occupational schemes. It varies the contribution charge on employees accordingto their ability to pay, and it shares the Exchequer subsidy among employeesaccording to their need for it. It can therefore be represented as a measure whichcombines financial reform and social justice, and though doubtless not an election-winner it is perhaps not wholly without political appeal.The Financial Comparison7. So much for the general issues. I now turn to the financial aspects onwhich my colleagues will expect me to give my considered views.8. The present national scheme is in deficit: and the deficits are bound toincrease at an alarming rate. We have decided that this burden on general taxation,growing faster than taxable capacity can possibly grow, is unacceptable. It wouldcripple our ability to finance from taxation other growing needs and would seriously inhibit our tax-reduction policy. Reform is therefore necessary. Raising(he pension age would be a useful palliative, which we hold in reserve, but it wouldnot in itself be enough. General taxation must be relieved and permanently by increased contribution income.9. Now Scheme A does nothing to improve the finances of the present schemeitself (except that it tentatively proposes to increase the flat rate contributionevery five years without increasing benefits). What it does is to start anotherscheme, designed on commercial terms, which would in itself make neither profitnor loss over the long term. It uses the income from the new scheme to supportthe finances of the old scheme, thus leaving the new scheme without the resources to meet its own emerging costs and, in the long term, effecting no improvement atall. I acknowledge, of course, that it would be helpful to the Exchequer, untilthe new scheme&apos;s bills fell due: but I cannot believe that it would be easy to defendor is the best we can do if we are really set on securing financial soundness.10. Scheme B on the other hand goes to the root of the matter and remodelsthe faulty finances of the present scheme itself, mainly by introducing the graduated contributions in place of the fiat rate. Its financial success depends, admittedly, on
an increase in real earnings secured through continued progress in the economy;but if we are not determined to secure that, we ought not to be considering anysocial reforms at all. On the assumption of an expanding economy, the schememasters the emerging deficits of the present scheme without creating any seriousnew emerging deficit of its own. Financially therefore it is much sounder thanScheme A.11. Actual figures for both schemes, as my colleagues know, are bound to beuncertain because they are affected by future levels of earnings and unemploymentwith, in the case of Scheme A, the added uncertainty of the numbers contracting-out, both at the outset and subsequently. (If occupational schemes grow, therewill be more contracting out.) But, for what they are worth, the following figures show the overall cost of the two schemes to the Exchequer on assumptions whichI do not regard as an unreasonable working basis*:  12. These figures assume quinquennial increases in the rate of contributionwithout increase in benefit. It would be easier to justify such increases in are formed scheme with a percentage contribution than in a continuation of theexisting scheme: they are indeed a feature of the United States scheme. Neverthe-less they must be regarded as a questionable feature of both schemes, and I would hope, on the basis of the above figures, that Scheme B, at least, might be able to afford to forgo some part of them when the time comes.13. The upper tier of Scheme A is intended to offer terms on a commercial basis and it offers them on an assumed interest rate of 3 per cent. Several employerspoint out, as I did myself earlier on, that this is much less than a commercial scheme can offer. It seems very doubtful whether, on Scheme A&apos;s own principles, this ratecan survive. But any increase would materially increase the cost of the scheme,either in the long-term (if benefits were adjusted) or from the start (if the contributionwere adjusted). It would, moreover, call in question the lower tier too, where thebenefit/contribution ratio is also on a 3 per cent, basis. A different basis wouldinvolve reassessment of the actuarial contribution, with the result that the presentflat rate contribution would show a greater degree of &quot; overload &quot; unless either the contribution or the benefits were adjusted; and the financial effects of any suchadjustment would of course be very serious indeed. None of these difficulties arise in Scheme B.14. Financially, Scheme B has the great advantage of being much moreresilient and adaptable than Scheme A. For instance, if unemployment is at anytime higher than 2 per cent, the cost of both schemes would be higher than the above figures, because of (i) increased benefit expenditure and (ii) lost contribution income.On (i) the two schemes run level: but on (ii) Scheme B has the advantage. It haslower contributions than Scheme A, particularly for those whom unemployment would most affect: it therefore stands up better to the impact of increasedunemployment.15. Again, suppose it becomes necessary to increase the present benefits, forinstance on cost of living grounds. Scheme A has no recourse but to increase the flat-rate contribution (which already bears hardly on the lower-paid) but theultimate increase in benefit payments would be greater and would add another sliceto the emerging deficit. And any such increase may call for a reappraisal by employers of whatever decision they may have taken about contracting out.Scheme B on the other hand is better placed. It may well be able to carry some atleast of the cost without adjusting contributions, because when cost of living and wages rise, Scheme B&apos;s income automatically rises too: or it can put up thepercentage contribution: or else it can raise the  8 &quot; floor &quot; and the  15 &quot; ceiling &quot;so as to keep them the same in real terms: or it can adopt some combination ofthese methods.* Unemployment 2 per cent.: earnings level at start of scheme (say, 1960) 8 per cent, abovemid-1957: 2 per cent. p.a. increase in real earnings: no increase in rate of Exchequer subsidy:for Scheme A one-third contracting out, with no allowance for any growth in occupational schemes.(  Million)Scheme A (September)Scheme B (August)1960-61   1965-66   1970-71   1980-81  2000-01112 136 157 195 274134 112 112 91 143
16. Since Scheme B rids the Exchequer of large growing burdens it clearlyopens the way for further social advance either in the National Insurance scheme or elsewhere. One can see a possibility, if the economy prospers, of increasingbenefits in real terms, of reducing (or at least not increasing) contribution; rates,of adding (if this is thought right) graduated benefits for sickness and unemployment.We shall be our own masters within the limits of what we can afford limits whichare materially less severe under Scheme B than under Scheme A.17. The August Scheme was originally devised as an attempt to find a soundway of financing a 10s. increase in benefits, to put them on a new standard. Wehave lost some of its political attractions by doing the latter in advance.Nevertheless its financial advantages remain very great.18. A serious point made against Scheme B as compared with Scheme A isits effect on the bigger of the public sector schemes. The central problem is thatof &quot; abatement&quot; viz., the modification of the benefits (and contributions) in occupational schemes to take account of the national retirement pension. Thisquestion is already with us and ought to be tackled anyhow. Scheme B wouldprobably make it essential to tackle it at once, if only in order to avoid significantprice increases in the nationalised industries; Scheme A, if workable, might enable us to postpone it.Conclusion19. I fully acknowledge that the intention, and effect, of Scheme A is to affordfinancial help to the Exchequer in the near future. It does so. But from what Ihave said it will be clear that it is not a financially sound scheme, and that Scheme Boffers advantages which any Chancellor of the Exchequer must be loth to forgo.I am asked to forgo them for the sake of two objectives to adopt the principlethat the State scheme should, on a compulsory basis, go beyond basic needs (whichis not, I think, politically sound), and to introduce into the State scheme the principleof contracting out (which there is strong reason to believe impracticable).Concession of these two principles by our Party would make much easier theintroduction of the Labour plan. Indeed, our opponents would probably be very glad if we tried to take these two hot chestnuts out of the fire for them.20. I do not think these objectives are sufficiently attractive to justify us inchoosing the less sound solution. If we do not make the best of our presentopportunity, we are not likely to get another for many years to come. I thereforeurge my colleagues, if they decide that they must now make their choice, to chooseScheme B.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,17th June, 1958.
