M. Ambassadors in Athens and Ankara, tothe earlier suggestion that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should propose the immediate establishment of a tridominium in Cyprus.(Signed)  NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W. 1.12th May, 1958
CYPRUSAIMS OF policy the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in Cyprus has hadfour main purposes:(a) to serve the best interests of all the people of the Island;(b) to achieve a permanent settlement acceptable to the two communities in the Island and to the Greek and turkish governments;(c) to safeguard the British bases and installations in the Island,which are necessary to enable the United Kingdom tocarry out her international obligations;(d) to strengthen peace and security, and co-operation betweenthe United Kingdom and her Allies, in a vital area.2. These are the aims which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently pursued and which have guided their efforts in recent months to find common ground on which an agreed settlement might be reached.It is deeply regretted that all attempts in this direction have hithertoproved unsuccessful.3. In view of the disagreement between the Greek and turkish governments and between the two communities in Cyprus, and of the disastrous consequences for all concerned if violence and conflictcontinue, an obligation rests with the United Kingdom Government, as the sovereign Power responsible for the administration of the Island and thewell-being of its inhabitants, to give a firm and clear load out of thepresent deadlock.     They accordingly declare a new policy which represents an adventure in partnership - partnership between the communities inthe Island and also between the Governments of the United Kingdom, greece and Turkey.4. The following is an outline of the partnership plan:THE PLA-NI. Cyprus should enj oy the advantages of association with theBritish Commonwealth and with Greece and Turkey too.II. Since the three Governments of the United Kingdom, Greece and turkey all have  an interest in Cyprus, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome the co-operation and participation of the two other governments in a joint effort to achieve the peace, progress and prosperity of the island.III. The Greek and Turkish Governments will each be invited toappoint a representative to co-operate with the Governor in carrying out this policyANNEX
IV. The Island will have a system of representative Governmentwith each community exercising autonomy in its own communal affairs.V. In order to satisfy the desire of the Greek and Turkish Cypriotsto be recognised as Greeks and Turks, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome an arrangement which gives them Greek or Turkish nationality,while enabling them to retain British nationality.VI. To allow time for the new principle of partnership to be fullyworked out and brought into operation in the necessary atmosphere of stability, the international status of the Island will remain unchanged forseven years.VII. A system of self-government and communal autonomy will be worked out by consultation with representatives of the two communities and with the representatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments.VIII. The essential provisions of the new constitution will be:(a) There will be a separate House of Representatives foreach of the two communities, and these Houses willhave final legislative authority in communal   affairs.(b) Authority for internal administration, other than communalaffairs and internal security, will be undertaken by a council presided over by the Governor and including representatives of the Greek and Turkish governments and six elected Ministers drawn from the Houses ofRepresentatives, four being Greek Cypriots and twoTurkish Cypriots.(c) The Governor, acting after consultation with therepresentatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments,will have reserve powers to ensure that the interestsof both communities are protected.(d) External affairs, defence and internal security will bematters specifically reserved to the Governor actingafter consultation with the representatives of theGreek and Turkish Governments.(e) The representatives of the Greek and Turkish governments will have the right to require any legislation which theyconsider to be discriminatory to be reserved forconsideration by an impartial tribunal.IX. If the full benefits of this policy are to be realised, it is evidentthat violence must cease.   Subject to this, Her Majesty1 s government intend to take progressive steps to relax the Emergency regulations and eventually to end the State of Emergency.   This process would include the return of those Cypriots at present excluded from the Islandunder the Emergency Regulations.2--
X. A policy based on these principles and proposals will givethe people of the Island a specially favoured and protected status.Through representative institutions they will have a voice in the managemenof the Island&apos;s internal affairs, and each community will control its owncommunal affairs.     While the people of the Island enjoy these advantages,friendly relations and practical co-operation between the United Kingdom,Greece and Turkey will be maintained and strengthened as Cyprus becomes a symbol of co-operation instead of a cause of conflict between the threeAllied Governments.THE FUTURE5. Her Majesty&apos;s Government trust that this imaginative plan will be welcomed by all concerned in the spirit in which it is putforward and that it may be found to pave the way towards a lastingsettlement.   For their part they will bend all efforts to ensure its success.   If other views were to prevail and it became necessary to seek a final solution of the problem of Cyprus along other lines itwould then be necessary to make appropriate provision for the strategic interests of the Governments concerned.   In that event, moreover.Her Majesty&apos;s Government would consider themselves bound by their previous assurances in regard to the application of the principle of self-determination.   It is, however, the hope and belief of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the natural and proper goal to which the new policy should lead would be a full sharing of sovereignty over Cyprus subject onlyto the reservation to the United Kingdom of such bases and facilities as might be necessary for the discharge of her international   obligations.Her Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly declare their willingness, whenthe time comes for a final settlement, to surrender their solesovereignty over the Island and to share that sovereignty with theGreek and Turkish Governments.11th May, 1958-3-
