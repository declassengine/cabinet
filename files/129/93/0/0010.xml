secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1958C. (58) 110 Copy No.16th May, 1958.cabinet european FREE TRADE AREA : ORIGIN PROBLEMSNote by the Paymaster-general  am circulating to my colleagues with this note a report by officials on the highly complicated but extremely important question of origin. This, as mycolleagues know, is the most difficult of all the problems in the Free Trade Areanegotiations and it is closely linked with the problem of the attitude of France.In so far as the problem of origin can be solved, we should have gone a good partof the way to meet the French difficulties.2. I hope to comment on some aspects of the report when we discuss it, butin the meantime I should like to make clear my own attitude to the question of tactics raised in paragraphs 38-39.3. Our original conception of the Free Trade Area was that there should be complete freedom of trade within the area but complete autonomy for each countryso far as its external tariffs and commercial policies were concerned. This would clearly have immense advantages for the United Kingdom. It would enable us tomaintain duty free Commonwealth entry but have low tariffs on those things inwhich we are principally concerned to keep them low, i.e., basic materials, whilehaving freedom of access to the European market, where many countries would wish to keep relatively high tariffs on the basic materials used by their own domestic producers. The competitive advantage for the United Kingdom would clearly bevery great: this is one of the reasons why it is very hard to achieve our objective in the negotiations.4. We may have to moderate our attitude, or at any rate its appearance, tosome extent in the course of the next few weeks. The attached report suggestsways in which this might be done and seeks the guidance of Ministers on the limits to be imposed and the extent to which movement within these very clearly definedlimits would be acceptable. I hope my colleagues would be prepared to give this amount of latitude in negotiation. If they accept the general line in the report,then I would not propose myself that anything in the nature of a negotiation ora commitment should be started until we have the views of the Six governments before us and there has been consultation with the Commonwealth. Subject tothat, I hope that I shall be given as much elbow room as possible in the tacticalhandling of a situation which is not getting easier, and which may call for fairlyrapid action at some stages.R. M.Gwydyr House, S.W.1.16th May, 1958.
EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA : ORIGIN PROBLEMSReport by the Economic Steering CommitteeI.   introduction. This report seeks new instructions for the continuation of the Free trade area (F.T.A.) negotiations. A formative stage has been reached at which usefulopportunities for exploratory discussions might well arise. The political will to achieve the F.T.A. is stronger in Europe than before, as has been shown for instance by the talks between the Prime Minister and Dr. Adenauer, the Federal german chancellor, and there are other indications of a growing appreciation in Europe(and also the United States) of the political and economic importance of F.T.A.2. But although the political background is more favourable, the negotiating position is of great difficulty. This is partly because of the French; partly becauseof the intrinsic complexities; and partly because the &quot; Six &quot; have not yet learnedto work together effectively. In this situation, it was felt that we could usefullyexplore various possibilities, without commitment, in order to influence the deliberations of the Six (and the attitude of the Scandinavians and others). It isnot intended that we should make proposals or put forward &quot; a British plan.&quot; Thepurpose is rather to enable our negotiators to ascertain where practical possibilitiesof settlement of the vital question of &quot; origin &quot; might lie.3. The paper, therefore, indicates certain guide-posts which define the limitswithin which it might be possible to move consistently with our economic interests.But it shows that important questions of principle are raised by any move: it wouldinvolve a departure from the basis on which the F.T.A. negotiations have been presented to the Commonwealth and to industry. This leads to the tactical question(referred to in paragraphs 38 and 39) whether it would be wiser to give our negotiators freedom to discuss without commitment within these limits, or alternatively to await definite proposals from the Six before proceeding with anyfurther discussions in Europe. But the substantial question of where these limitsshould be fixed, and of the possible implications of moving to them, need to bedecided whatever the tactical decision may be.II. THE ORIGIN  PROBLEM4. The question is simply, which goods should get F.T.A. treatment? Howshall the Customs officials in the seventeen countries decide whether a particularpackage of goods is eligible for duty-free entry? The solution adopted will beof fundamental importance in deciding whether the F.T.A. is worthwhile tothe United Kingdom. In a Customs Union, goods entering all parts of the territorypay the same tariff, and can thus be allowed to circulate freely inside the Union.But in F.T.A., each country is free to fix its own external tariff. Rules are thenneeded to prevent the &quot; undermining&quot; of the high-tariff countries&apos; externaltariffs by imports coming from outside F.T.A. via the low-tariff countries, either directly or after processing there.5. For example, suppose the Six have a common external tariff on zincof 20 per cent., but Norway imports Australian zinc duty-free. If &quot; Norwegian &quot;zinc is allowed to move freely into France, the French zinc producers at oncelose their protection against Australian zinc. Even if this direct undermining isprevented (not easy if the commodity is such that the source is not readilydistinguishable) there may still be a &quot; deflection of trade,&quot; for the production ofzinc castings in Norway would be in a favoured position to supply the Six, gettingits raw material duty-free while its competitors have to pay a 20 per cent, tariff on theirs.6. Such problems of &quot; deflection of trade &quot; are inescapable in F.T.A. Theirseriousness will depend upon the differences in the external tariffs at the various stages of manufacture. It was accepted in the preliminary work in the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) that if there were significantdifferences in tariff policies on basic materials, there would be great difficulty inmaking a workable F.T.A.
7. The United Kingdom proposal for origin rules is to have a combination of:-(a) a &quot; percentage content &quot; test (as in Commonwealth Preference); the productwould qualify for duty-free movement if more than, say 50 per cent,of its value was conferred by work done in F.T.A.; there would be alist of basic materials which, no matter what the actual source, would all be regarded for this purpose as coming from F.T.A.; and(b) the acceptance of particular processes (such as, e.g., oil refining) asconferring F.T.A. origin.There would be procedure for ad hoc examination of particular cases where,despite the application of these rules, there was agreed to be &quot; deflection of trade,&quot;with the possibility of special measures, agreed by the governing body of F.T.A.to deal with them.8. This is not acceptable to the Six, partly because of the desire of theFrench and the Italians to protect their basic materials industries, partly becauseof fears of more widespread &quot; deflection of trade&quot; than could be treatedexceptionally, and partly because of the administrative difficulties which theyclaim to see in working a &quot; percentage content&quot; system. This has led to theFrench proposal for a sector-by-sector approach and other devices which wouldso restrict the scope of F.T.A. as to render it useless. For some months, therefore,there has been deadlock in this vital matter.The Carli Proposal9. An idea for breaking this deadlock has been proposed by ProfessorCarli. the Italian representative on the Paymaster-General&apos;s Ministerial Group.He suggests that as the difficulty arises from the differences between the externaltariffs of the members, the right arrangement would be to allow trade to flowfreely between countries whose external tariffs on the product were equal (or within an agreed defined range or &quot;band&quot;); and in other cases to permit thecountry with the higher tariff to impose a compensation tax on imports from thelower.&quot; If, for example, the Swedish duty on a certain chemical was 15 per cent.,and the common tariff of the Six was 25 per cent., Germany would be entitledto impose a compensation tax of, say 10 per cent, (according to the formula chosen)on imports of this chemical from Sweden.10. There are many possible variants of this idea, with very differing effects.None of them can be regarded as dealing comprehensively with the problems of origin; some will still require stringent origin certificates and others less so; mostof them present formidable administrative difficulties. The distinguishing markis that all bring the level of the external tariff into the negotiation, and open upthe possibility of systematic imposition of compensation taxes on goods movingwithin the F.T.A.11. We could not accept this in principle. To do so would involve us in a choice. We could &quot; harmonise &quot; our external tariff with the rest of the Seventeen(i.e., commit ourselves not to reduce below a certain level). Or we could acceptcompensation taxes against our exports where our tariff was lower than theaverage, and permit our tariff to be undermined where (as is generally so formanufactured goods) it was above the average. We should not be able to chargecompensation taxes ourselves, for to allow countries with above-average tariffsto do this would push tariffs up all round. In this second course, we should thus be under continuous internal pressure to bring our tariffs to the average, and soin effect &quot; harmonise &quot; them.12. This concept would thus surrender de iure or weaken de facto our freedom of manoeuvre in fixing our tariffs vis-a-vis the United States and other non-Commonwealth and non-F.T.A. sources (Latin America, Middle and far east, Soviet bloc). We should be hard pressed to put duties on imports from theCommonwealth (which is logically implied in the principle): we might avoid this for basic materials, particularly because the Six need to maintain free entry for goods from their overseas territories; and for a wide range of manufacturedgoods simple certificates of origin would suffice to prevent Commonwealth goods from penetrating into the area via the United Kingdom. But Commonwealthfree entry would be an anomaly which would almost certainly lead to conflictsooner or later.
13. Nevertheless, although the widespread or universal application of theCarli proposal would be unacceptable, certain elements in it would probably bea necessary part of any ultimate compromise. The idea, coming from the Italians(and thus tending to separate them from the French) has considerable political andnegotiating significance.Limits of Compromise14. In the light of these considerations, is there a basis for settlement? Ifthe Six insisted on &quot; harmonisation &quot; and &quot; compensation taxes in lieu,&quot; there couldbe none. But can we move at all? The following paragraphs set out the limit which we would regard as acceptable in the United Kingdom&apos;s widest economic interest.15. We would confine the acceptance of any idea of &quot; harmonisation &quot; to basic materials, and this at low or zero levels. This would be advantageous to our interests if we could get it. At the other end of the production scale, manufacturedgoods, we definitely reject these concepts for the general run of products; but wemust allow for special cases which cannot be satisfactorily covered by origin rules,and for which compensation taxes may be the only answer. In the intermediatearea of semi-manufactures and components, and the mixed sectors of chemicals and textiles (in which some sections&apos; raw materials are others&apos; finished goods), wemust be ready to look for special arrangements and cannot exclude discussion of external tariff levels and compensation taxes; these are difficult problems that mustbe dealt with in any case. Lastly, we must throughout insist upon Commonwealthfree entry.16. The limit of compromise might be:  (i) General. Agreement on simple origin rules for the first four-year stage(in which tariffs will not have been sufficiently reduced to raise these problems) and agreement on procedures for negotiation during the first stage (or some shorter period) on the specific matters outlined in;(ii)-(vi) below.(ii) Basic Materials. Agreement to negotiate between the Seventeen in orderto see if agreement can be reached on low or zero external tariffs: the precise scope of the basic materials field cannot be defined, but it is inour interest to extend it widely.(iii) Manufactured Goods. Agreement that the normal origin rules should bea combination of &quot; percentage content &quot; and &quot; processing &quot; criteria, with negotiations to determine special arrangements covering part or all ofthe sectors below, and with provision that the institutions of F.T.A.should be able, by two-thirds majority, to authorise the use, where appropriate, of compensation taxes or other measures in special other cases where there is deflection of trade (on agreed definition) or wherethe normal rules cannot be satisfactorily supplied.(iv) Components  and  Assembly  Parts. Agreement  to  negotiate  where necessary on the &quot; alignment &quot; or balance of each country&apos;s external tariff (i.e., the relation between the tariffs on parts and on finished products). This would counter the fear that external tariffs on UnitedStates engineering products may be undermined by assembly in F.T.A.of duty-free United States parts.(v) Chemicals. Agreement to negotiate special arrangements for some of this sector, possibly involving some harmonisation of external tariffs(provided that Canadian duty-free entry is maintained see (vii) below).This is an intractable sector, in which the raw materials of some parts ofthe industry are the finished products of others; in which high protectionis desired against North American competition, and in which it isdifficult (and the Continentals say impossible) to work origin rules.(vi) Textiles. Agreement to  negotiate special  arrangements, subject to(vii) below. This is another difficult sector, in which all the Europeanproducers (and the United Kingdom producers too) are determined toavoid being exposed to Oriental competition (Commonwealth orotherwise).(vii) Commonwealth Free Entry. Recognition (preferably in the F.T.A.Convention itself) that the United Kingdom would not be required to
impose new duties or quota restrictions on imports from theCommonwealth or be debarred from removing existing duties or quota restrictions (e.g., McKenna duties on Canadian cars and rayon orquotas on Canadian goods) or accept interim arrangements whichmanifestly leave us vulnerable to pressure at a later stage. Similarsafeguards for free entry into the Six of goods from their overseas territories, and similarly for Portugal. (It follows that we should insist that any &quot; tariff harmonisation &quot; or &quot; compensation taxes in lieu,&quot;would be calculated on most-favoured-nation tariffs alone.)Implications for the United Kingdom17. The implication of (i) is that the F.T.A. Convention would be signed,ratified and come into force, and the tariff reductions start, before the detailed negotiations for important sectors of industry had been completed. This is implicit in any F.T.A.: there is so much detailed work to be done in some sectors that wecould not practically delay signature until it was all finished. But this does implyuncertainty for some parts of industry, whose status would still remain to be negotiated. How wide this area of uncertainty would be (and how far it couldultimately affect the balance of pros and cons) we cannot yet say: it would depend upon how fast we wished to press and how early we wished to get the other countriescommitted.18. In (ii), the intentions of the Six would be put to the test, for the freetreatment of basic materials is decisive to the practicability of F.T.A.: theinclusion in effect of the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and Switzerland in thenegotiations with the Six on the common tariff for certain basic materials, knownas &quot; List G,&quot; would greatly increase the pressure on France. To secure agreement to low or zero external tariffs for basic materials and semis (or reduce thesignificant divergencies to a few special cases) would:  (a) greatly reduce the possible area of &quot; deflections of trade &quot;;(b) be a symbol that the F.T.A. would be &quot; outward-looking&quot;;(c) provide considerable advantages for the Commonwealth exporters of rawmaterials.19. In spite of these advantages, this course would have dangers, for it isin effect &quot; tariff harmonisation &quot; and would accept the principle of negotiatingexternal tariffs. We should have to be prepared either to reduce our externaltariffs on certain raw materials (and so reduce or eliminate a commonwealth preference, not only vis-a-vis the F.T.A. countries as already contemplated butalso vis-a-vis imports from all sources) or to permit tariff and preference to be undermined by duty-free imports via Europe. East African sisal is an illustration;it now has a 10 per cent, preferential margin over Brazilian sisal, which would be either formally lost or undermined, for sisal will enter the Six duty free. Suchcases are not likely to be important in detail or in the aggregate (we should probably have to reduce these tariffs in any case in order to maintain our competitive position in the F.T.A.). To the Commonwealth as a whole the possiblelosses of preference in particular commodities would be eclipsed by the advantages of getting low or zero tariffs throughout the F.T.A. for basic materials generally.But we would be formally abandoning as part of the F.T.A. negotiations,Preferences vis-a-vis non-F.T.A. countries in the United Kingdom market which commonwealth countries now enjoy.20. Commonwealth free entry would be an overriding condition, but we might well be pressed to raise our external tariff in order to &quot; harmonise &quot; at a&quot; moderate &quot; rather than a &quot; low &quot; level. This would be so damaging for our industry that we could not accept it.21. In (iii), the practical danger is that the list of exceptions would becomeso wide that it could no longer be handled by ad hoc treatment, and that we should thus be forced towards a &quot; principle &quot; of &quot; tariff harmonisation &quot; (or, at best, a&quot; principle &quot; of &quot; compensation taxes in lieu &quot; if tariffs are different). If we were successful under (ii), this danger would be manageable, and the &quot; deflections oftrade &quot; should be few. Even if it proved impossible under (ii) to &quot; harmonise &quot;all the external tariffs on basic materials at a low or zero level, it might still bepossible to limit the extent to which the remaining divergencies (particularly in non--ferrous metals) became the foundation for further special measures to prevent&quot; deflections of trade &quot; at the higher stages of manufacture.
22. We may not succeed in getting such sharp definitions of what constitutesan exceptional case as would automatically limit to a few items the field ofcompensation taxes where tariffs are unequal. Much would be left to the F.T.A.institutions, and we should be at risk if, as time passed, a two-thirds majorityultimately came to favour &quot; harmonisation &quot; in principle, and exerted pressure on doubtful cases accordingly.23. We should not go beyond (iii). The line is difficult to draw, for theultimate outcome will depend upon how tightly the onus of proof can be placed upon those seeking special arrangements, how strong the presumption that compensation taxes are the &quot; natural &quot; answer, and upon the ultimate attitudeof the F.T.A. institutions in such cases. The further we go, moreover, the morewe limit our freedom of manoeuvre outside the F.T.A. and the Commonwealth.24. Special arrangements under (iv), (v) and (vi) are inevitable, apart fromthe question of tariff harmonisation (though this might be an element in thesolution of these intractable problems). The Carli proposals have no bearing here.We should hope strictly to limit (iv) and perhaps avoid it altogether; in (v) and (vi)we must be prepared to examine without prejudice all possible approachesconsistent with Commonwealth free entry.Impact on the Commonwealth25. However firmly we stick to Commonwealth free entry, the proposals above would represent a departure from the basis on which we have obtainedCommonwealth agreement to the negotiations for the F.T.A. They involve the riskof some loss or undermining of preferences vis-a-vis non-F.T.A. countries, in basic materials and, in some special cases, in manufactured goods; the ultimate solutionsin components, chemicals and textiles may be unwelcome to the Commonwealth.Against this, to secure a low or zero tariff for basic materials would be a real gainfor the Commonwealth, not only in terms of direct trade, but also as evidence of&quot; outward-looking &quot; intentions. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that we shallhave considerable influence in the F.T.A. institutions.26. This is not the only departure in prospect. It is now clear that our previous definition of &quot; agriculture &quot; for the purpose of exclusion from F.T.A.arrangements (Chapters 1 to 24 of the Brussels Nomenclature) is not negotiablewith the Six and that it will be necessary to use the shorter definition in Annex ii of the Rome Treaty which in effect brings processed foods out of the &quot; AgriculturalAgreement &quot; and into the F.T.A. This incidentally suits the United Kingdominterest also.  Proposals on this have been put to Ministers separately.27. It is now probable moreover that the Six will launch proposals designedto seek a sharing of preference with us over a wide range of goods in the australian and New Zealand markets. We shall resist this and in so far as it contains no suggestion of any specific advantages for the Commonwealth, commonwealth governments can be expected to reject it also. But here again is an opening forill-feeling and confusion and weakening of Commonwealth trade links.28. Indeed, there may well be a danger that Australia and New Zealand inparticular will seek to come to terms with the Six at the United Kingdom&apos;sexpense, and that the proposals of Six about preference, when they come, willbe regarded as an opportunity for Australia and New Zealand which the UnitedKingdom should not resist.29. These matters will not necessarily in the aggregate damage theCommonwealth^ economic interests. The Commonwealth realise that we maybe forced to move and their interests would be more seriously damaged by a breakdown of the F.T.A. project, which would be likely to be followed byuncertainty and lack of cohesion in the world economy and a movement away from the multilateral order that is most favourable to the Commonwealth^interests, and which we shall be seeking to preserve in the management of theF.T.A.30. The negotiation is beginning to assume a form in which it carries realrisks for Commonwealth Preference. These risks arise not because of genuinedamage to the interests of the Commonwealth countries but because of the lackof confidence and irritation that may be engendered within the commonwealth and the opportunity provided for trouble-makers, not only outside but also within
the Commonwealth. Now that the F.T.A. negotiation is running headlong intoareas of Commonwealth economic interest, the need to have continuousconsultation with the Commonwealth imposes great difficulties on our negotiations in Europe. If we consult the Commonwealth early, we arouse apprehensions andcritical reactions; if we wait for a definite proposition to crystallise, our positionis prejudiced because the Commonwealth will learn of the course of events from elsewhere. The complexity of the negotiation, and the intangibility of so manyof the issues, put a great strain on Commonwealth confidence in us.Commonwealth Consultation31. It is clear that the next step must be a thorough discussion when the officials come at the beginning of June for the preparatory meeting for theCommonwealth Trade and Economic Conference. If it were decided to explore the territory of paragraph 16 above with the Europeans, it would seem suitable to inform the Commonwealth by telegram of the present state of the negotiations to tell them that we are faced with a number of difficult problems in thenegotiations and that these require urgent examination with the Six in order toenable us to protect the interests of both the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth; and that we therefore propose to have informal and non-committal talks with European countries in order to establish more precisely theirattitudes so that we could undertake useful and effective consultation with commonwealth officials at the beginning of the preparatory meeting for theCommonwealth Trade and Economic Conference.III.-ASSESSMENT32. To sum up, it seems likely that if there is to be a Free Trade Area we maywell have to make some move from the position on external tariffs which her majesty&apos;s Government took in the White Paper of February 1957, Cmnd. 72, whichdenned the project, viz.:  &quot; The members of this F.T.A., would be free to keep their own separate and different tariffs on imports from outside the Area .... they v/ould alsobe able to vary these tariffs, subject to any international agreements by whichthey are bound from time to time.&quot;33. To move at all on this matter would represent a considerable departure from our present publicly announced position, involving risks vis-a-vis theCommonwealth which could lead to further erosion of Commonwealth Preference.34. Moreover, once any departure has taken place on such a matter ofprinciple, it may be difficult to find a new point at which to justify a stand, and wecould ultimately be forced to slide much beyond the original intention. We have tended in recent years to over-estimate our bargaining power, and consequently our ability to keep within fixed limits of our own choosing.35. Within the limits laid down in paragraph 16 above, we think the risks are worth taking. The political and economic importance of securing the F.T.A. is so great that it would, in our view, outweigh these risks. In business terms, F.T.A.within these limits would be advantageous to the United Kingdom, and we thinkthat it would be possible, given proper consultation, to secure the acquiescence ofthe Commonwealth.36. We cannot say at this stage whether F.T.A. could be negotiated with europe within those limits. This will depend ultimately upon the strength of thepolitical will in Europe, and the Europeans&apos; appraisal of the consequences ofbreakdown. It may well soon become necessary, in order to prevent the negotiationfrom slipping into new and wholly unacceptable territory (e.g., the substitution ofpseudo-Customs Union for F.T.A., and the &quot; sharing &quot; of Preference), for her majesty&apos;s Government to adopt a much more downright attitude than has beenpossible hitherto.&apos; 37. On balance our view is that the risks of moving within the limits proposed are less than the risks of adopting an entirely rigid attitude on this matter, and that unless we are prepared to move (at the moment we are only suggesting explanatory discussions) we shall not reach agreement with the Six.
Tactics38. There remains the tactical question of whether our negotiators shouldhave freedom to discuss without commitment within these limits, in order toascertain where a settlement might lie. The alternative would be to abstain from further substantive discussion in Europe until such time as the Six have produceddefinite proposals for our (and the Scandinavians&apos; and others&apos;) consideration. Bothtactical courses contain risks the former of being drawn on to a dangerous road,and the latter of losing whatever opportunities the political atmosphere may present to influence the thought of the supporters and opponents of F.T.A. among the Six,and to maintain a momentum of leadership among the non-Six.39. The Committee are divided as between these two courses. Some membersconsider that the first course would have considerable value in influencing the viewsof the Six before the next meeting of the Paymaster-General&apos;s Inter-governmental committee. Other members, who rate the prospects of negotiating within the limitslaid down lower and the risks of misunderstanding with the Commonwealth higherthan their colleagues, wish to make a positive recommendation in favour of thelatter course.May 1958.
AppendixFACTS ABOUT EUROPEAN TARIFF RATESTariffs on Basic MaterialsI. The United Kingdom has no significant duties on the main basic materialswith the exception of vegetable oils, sisal, leather and hardwood. (We do haveduties on a wide range of minor basic materials predominantly imported from theCommonwealth.) Iron and steel is a special case and is dealt with at the end ofthis section.2. The Scandinavians and Swiss tend to have policies of free entry for basic materials.3. Within the Six there is a contrast of policy between the protective outlookof France and Italy and the free entry arrangements in Benelux; Germany occupiesan intermediate position. There is economically inefficient production in germany of aluminium, crude oil and synthetic rubber, and there is a current German desireto maintain tariff protection at least for the transitional period. In addition to difficulties on those same materials, France and Italy have special problems andlead, zinc and vegetable oils. Tariffs are not the only means of giving protection in some of these cases; and, in other cases, the effective protection is not as great as the tariffs would suggest because of the operation of price control, exportcontrols, duty quotas and other devices.4. There is a further group of basic materials where countries within the Sixhave tariff protection mainly against the competition of other O.E.E.C. countries:e.g., ferro-alloys, timber and pulp.5. On iron and steel there is no great variation between European tariffs.United Kingdom duties are down to 10 per cent., and tariff differences are not now a source of trouble in this sector.The Proposal for Aligning Most-favoured-nation Tariffs on Components and finished Goods6. The proposal on the main paper is that we should be prepared to discuss&quot; alignment &quot; of each country&apos;s tariffs as between parts and manufactured goods.7. The French propose alignment of tariffs only in respect of engineeringgoods. Their proposal is that each country would be required to apply the same rate of duty to complete machines and to the component parts of these samemachines; there would be no obligation to harmonise tariffs as between differentO.E.E.C. countries. The object is to deter the development of assembly industries in Europe dependent for their existence on specially low tariffs for components,and in particular to prevent tariffs on United States engineering goods from beingundermined by the growth of assembly in Europe of duty-free or reduced dutyparts from the United States.8. It is United Kingdom Customs policy that the duty on machinery partsmust be at least as high as the duty on complete machines and the only exceptionsare a few special cases of clearly recognisable parts, e.g., rolls for rolling mills.9. Other countries outside the Six tend to have the same kind of tariffstructure in this respect as the United Kingdom, though in Ireland there aredifferential quantitative restriction arrangements which favour the import ofcomponents as compared with complete machines in order to encourage assembly.10. Within the Six there are extensive examples of tariffs on parts being lower than tariffs on the corresponding complete machines. The Benelux motor-car tariffis a case in point. There are a number of further examples within the Frenchtariff.Tariffs on ChemicalsII. The chemicals sector consists basically of inorganic and organic chemicals,dyestuffs and plastics; this is what is meant by the phrase &quot; the chemicals sector(narrowly defined)&quot; which is used in the following paragraphs. Often, however,the term is used to cover also pharmaceuticals, explosives, fertilisers, petroleum products, rubber (including synthetic rubber), soaps and paints, and it is against thiswider background that the French have proposed complete tariff harmonisation inthe chemicals sector.
12. The United Kingdom tariff structure is unsystematic in the chemicalsector (taking the narrower definition). Our tariff on synthetic organic chemicalsis 33]- per cent, and the hope is that we shall have the same duty on dyestuffs. Over^.the rest of the field within the narrower definition the general ad valorem duty of***p10 per cent, applies extensively. There are numerous exemptions and temporarysuspensions. Ingredient duties apply in a number of cases. Further, the duties on non-ferrous metal products are so defined as also to cover chemicals closely associated with the metals, e.g., copper sulphate; the rates of duty for that type ofproduct are usually 20 per cent, or 334; per cent.13.   The tariff of the Six in the chemicals sector (narrowly defined) is around20 per cent.   In other O.E.E.C. countries the duties tend to be much lower.14. In drawing any conclusions about relative heights of United Kingdomand Continental tariffs, it is important to remember that we admit Canadianchemicals free of duty.Tariffs on Manufactured Goods15. In the case of machinery our duties tend to be around 174- per cent, and duties elsewhere in Europe are on the whole lower, averaging perhaps 124- per cent.Most O.E.E.C. imports of machinery from third countries tend to be highly specialised, and consequently we have arrangements under which we remit paymentof duty on approximately half of our imports. Other O.E.E.C. countriespresumably arrange likewise, but we do not have the evidence.16. In the case of textiles, tariffs are a secondary consideration. The UnitedKingdom duties on silk and artificial silk are exceptionally high. Otherwise thereare few important differences in European tariffs, duties tending to be around 10 percent, on yarn and 17 per cent, on fabrics.Items where the United Kingdom Tariff is below Average17. The items in which United Kingdom tariff is below the average areplastics, detergents, miscellaneous chemicals, basic materials, manufacturedfoodstuffs, and an indeterminate range of other goods.
