Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1958C. (58) 143 Copy No. 5 39th July, 1958CABINETANGLO-EGYPTIAN RESETTLEMENT board memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy SealAttached is a copy of a confidential memorandum which the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board have sent to me. It outlines the remaining problems concerningAnglo-Egyptian refugees and suggests that the Board should be wound up by31st December.2. The Board consider that the great bulk of their task of relief and resettlement will have been completed by the end of the year. Very few, if any,of the refugees who will not by then have been resettled will be capable ofresettlement by the methods the Board have been authorised to use. The moreimportant of the remaining problems will relate to indefinite relief rather thanresettlement.3.   These problems are as follows:  (a) Some of the refugees in hostels will, for one reason or another, never beable to stand on their own feet again. For example, some are mentallydeficient, others are shiftless people who have never made themselvesindependent. Probably it will always be necessary to keep them in ahostel. When the Board is wound up the only possible solution seemsto be for them to be accommodated in a hostel maintained by theNational Assistance Board.(b) There are a few hundred refugees who are living in private accommodationon the strength of generous allowances made to them by the Board, andwho have no immediate prospects of being able to maintain themselves.Mostly they are elderly people who were well-to-do in Egypt, and itwould be both harsh and politically difficult to reduce them suddenlyto National Assistance Board standards of maintenance. A financial settlement with Egypt might enable some but probably by no meansall of these people to become independent again. The only possible courses of action seem to be (i) to let them rely solely on National Assistance, or(ii) to continue the Boards existence indefinitely.(c) If the Board is wound up soon, some Government Department or agencywill have to assume responsibility for paying certain pensions if theEgyptian Government have not resumed payments by then.(d) At the end of this year there may be refugees who are still expecting toemigrate, who will need to be maintained in hostels or elsewhere forthe time being, and who will need financial or other help to emigrate.(e) It is not impossible that at the end of the year there may be a few refugees who will have some prospects of becoming independent again if giventhe sort of help the Board normally give.
(/) The Board take great pains to ensure, as far as possible, that a refugee willbe able to stand on his own feet again if given a final resettlement grant,but inevitably some subsequently fall on hard times. The Anglo-Egyptian Aid Society are likely to represent that they should be givensubstantial financial help to relieve distress in these cases. There maybe considerable political pressure in favour of this, but there is a gooddeal to be said against it: there ought to come a time when able-bodiedrefugees should take their chance of future misfortune along withordinary residents here and fall back, if necessary, on the normal social services.(g) The Board draw attention to the possibility of further British subjectsarriving here from Egypt and expecting help. It seems reasonable,however, to refuse to regard these people as Suez refugees.(h) The ex gratia loans granted by the Board will have to be recovered if thereis a financial settlement with Egypt. It is contemplated that this taskmight be undertaken by the Foreign Compensation Commission bydeducting the amounts of the loans from the payments due from thecompensation paid by Egypt.4. The most difficult problem is clearly that mentioned in sub-paragraph (b)above. It would, however, become a problem only when the Board was wound up.This, therefore, is an argument against deciding to terminate the Board&apos;s existenceuntil settlement has been reached with Egypt and it is possible to assess the problembetter. If the Board continued after the end of this year the minor problemsmentioned in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) might also be solved by the board or solve themselves. Moreover, if no settlement with Egypt is reached within thenext few months and it becomes desirable, for example, to extend the ex gratialoan scheme, the Board will be needed after the end of the year.5. On the other hand, if only for reasons of economy the Board ought tobe wound up as soon as possible. So long as it is in existence there will always be pressure for it to extend rather than contract the assistance it provides. Its taskis one of temporary relief and resettlement and it ought not to continue indefinitelyas an organisation for maintaining a small section of the community as a privilegedclass. There is much to be said for the Board&apos;s own view that by the end of theyear it will have substantially completed the task it was given. Sooner or later theresponsibility for any remaining tasks must be assumed by one GovernmentDepartment or another.6. In my view a decision about the date when the Board is to be wound up should be deferred for the time being. Possible ways of settling the residualproblems require further discussion between the Departments concerned, and itwill be advantageous to see how the negotiations with Egypt progress. I therefore propose to tell the Chairman of the Board that we are studying the problems towhich the Board have drawn attention; that since they are difficult problems this may take a little time; and that I will let him know the Governments views assoon as possible.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,8th July, 1958.
REPORT BY THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN RESETTLEMENT board to THE HOME SECRETARYWe were appointed on 5th February, 1957, to co-ordinate the work being done to assist the British subjects coming to this country from Egypt. The methodsadopted to meet the immediate needs of the evacuees and to assist their resettlementeither in the United Kingdom or abroad, were outlined in the progress report madeby the Board in July 1957.2. A further progress report has been made from which it will be seen thatthe Board are of opinion that it is now possible to determine the size of the residualproblem still to be dealt with before it can be said that the primary purpose forwhich we were appointed has been accomplished.3. It is expected that within the next few months a measure of resettlementwill be achieved in the majority of cases still within the care of the Board, but thereare four main resettlement problems which remain to be dealt with before theBoard can be wound up:  (1) some individuals and family groups are still awaiting emigration andarrangements for passages must be made in those cases which are approved by the authorities concerned;(2) some persons who, through failure to secure employment, low income,housing difficulties or a general inability to adapt themselves to changed conditions have not hitherto become self-supporting, may still become eligible for resettlement by the normal means available to the Board;(3) arrangements must be made for the future accommodation andmaintenance of those persons who, as a result of infirmity, mentaldisability or other adequate reasons, cannot be resettled in the normal way and who therefore require assistance in one form or another foran indefinite period;(4) whilst most of the aged will, it is hoped, be resettled with relatives or friendsor be accommodated in residential clubs, the first of which is expectedto be available early in October, there remains a further group apartfrom those referred to in (2) above who may become eligible for normalresettlement grants. These are people who cannot become self-supporting in the foreseeable future but who may still be accomodated in rented nouses or flats and receive a furnishing grant from the Boardfollowed by continuing maintenance payments from the national assistance Board.4. In the event of the Board ceasing to function there would remain a numberof other problems which would require administrative action for some time to come,either by the appropriate Government Departments or by some other form of organisation namely:  (1) the continued payment of pensions to former Egyptian government officials and others until such time as the Egyptian Government assumesfull responsibility for such obligations;(2) the recovery of ex-gratia loans, in the event of the desequestration ofproperty by the Egyptian Government, and the recovery of business and education loans and pension advances;(3) continuation of the maintenance allowances now being paid by the board to certain persons expelled from Egypt in 1951 and whose circumstances are such that it is unlikely that they would be eligible to receive assistancefrom the National Assistance Board;(4) those at present fully or partly maintained by the Board, mainly living inLondon, and paying rents above the average for furnished accomodation or receiving full board and lodging at a relatively high cost, who will refuse to accept resettlement by way of unfurnished rented accommodation outside London coupled with a furnishing grant fromthe Board and continuing maintenance by the National assistance board;
(5) provision for those British subjects still in Egypt, but who may be forcedto leave that country as a result of economic or other pressure and whocome to the United Kingdom. Though the number of such cases is atpresent small, it is for decision to what extent such persons should receivethe special forms of assistance at present afforded under the powers ofthe Board;(6) finally there is a matter which falls entirely outside the scope of the Board,but which the Board feels it necessary to bring to the Governmentsnotice. The attention of the Board has been drawn to the number ofcases in which persons who have been resettled within the limits of thepowers of the Board are for one reason or another seeking assistance ofthe voluntary organisations or have fallen into financial difficulties. the voluntary societies of the country will naturally continue to helpevacuees who, whilst resettled as ordinary members of the community,may still be in need of assistance of one kind or another, but it isappreciated that these societies are unable to meet the financial demands which will inevitably arise.5. Having fully considered the position the Board are of opinion that by31st December, 1958, the effective work of the Board, under the original directions,will, with minor exceptions, have been completed. It is their view that when thisstage is reached it will no longer be necessary for the Board to remain in being. the exceptions are a small number of potential resettlement cases and residual cases, inwhich any form of resettlement may be impracticable, including those mentioned at (4) above. These latter constitute a major political problem on which the Boarddo not feel competent to advise, recognising as they do the difficulties which may arise from the continuance of special arrangements for this small section of thegeneral community. The Board are aware that a separate submission is being madeto the Home Secretary by the Anglo-Egyptian Aid Society on this subject.In all the circumstances the Board submits that the time has come whenMinisters should consider what arrangements should be made, when the work of theBoard ceases, to deal with the residual cases and continuing liabilities mentionedabove.6. With regard to the financial implications of paragraph 4 (6) above it is wellknown that the Anglo-Egyptian Aid Society has limited funds, raised by publicsubscription, at its disposal. It is natural that evacuees will look to this Society forassistance and it is understood that the Society will be making direct representationsfor financial assistance to this end. It is the view of the Board that if such assistance is to be afforded the Anglo-Egyptian Aid Society should be strengthenedadministratively.COLYTON.Chairman.27th June, 1958.
