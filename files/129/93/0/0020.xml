PRIME MINISTERS COMMONWEALTH TOURPART IINTRODUCTIONIn January and February 1958 the Prime Minister visited India, Pakistan,Ceylon, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. This introduction deals with the tour as a whole. Part II of the print analyses briefly the visits to each particular country; Part III contains a diary of the tour; and Part IV comments on the Pressarrangements. Appendix A gives particulars of the party accompanying the PrimeMinister; Appendix B contains records of the business talks with the Prime ministers and other Ministers of the countries visited; and Appendix C sets out the subsequentdespatches from the respective United Kingdom High Commissioners.2. During the tour the Prime Minister flew over 33,000 miles in 120 hours.He travelled a further 1,500 miles by road. Four nights were spent flying and34 other nights were spent at 17 different centres.3. On his return to London the Prime Minister told his colleagues that he feltthat his tour had helped to emphasise the strength and unity of the new commonwealth. In the Asian countries of the Commonwealth, and especially inIndia, he had been impressed by the respect in which the British people were nowheld and by the balanced view which was taken by leaders of opinion on the valueof their connection, past and present, with Britain. In Australia and New Zealandhe had everywhere found evidence of strong loyalty to the United Kingdom, basedon common origins and common allegiance to the Crown; and the keen desire thatthe economic development of those countries should be based on British manpower and British capital reflected the strong emotional urge that these countries shouldpreserve their British character. It was natural therefore that people in Australiaand New Zealand should at first have felt some misgivings about the admission ofAsian and African members to the Commonwealth; and even now they showed lessinterest in them than they should. The United Kingdom had a duty to interpret the new members of the Commonwealth to the old; to emphasise the significance of a Commonwealth association whose members were united by their commonbelief in the principles of Parliamentary democracy and individual freedom; andto indicate the importance of the role which this unique association could play inthe world struggle between the forces of tyranny and of freedom. This presented a challenge to Commonwealth statesmanship, and might well prove to be aninspiration not only to the new members of the Commonwealth but to people inthe United Kingdom as well.4. To Parliament the Prime Minister said that there were some who mighthave thought the passing of the old British Empire marked a decline similar to thatwhich has been the fate of other great empires in the past. But in the emergence of the Commonwealth something had taken place which was unprecedented inhistory; and the best of the old Empire was continuing with the new Commonwealth.Here, extending right across the globe, was something sound, solid and unique a powerful instrument for strengthening the principles of the free world.5. The following are among the factors which seem to have combined to makethe Prime Minister^ mission the success which it was everywhere proclaimed tobe:  (i) It was the first time that any of the countries to which the Prime Ministerwent had been visited by a United Kingdom Prime Minister in office.This gave to each visit a special flavour and significance.(ii) The tour could not have been made at a more opportune moment.   it followed closely upon the Prime Ministers consultations in October-December 1957 with the United States President, the Canadian PrimeMinister, and other NATO Heads of Government, and at a time when there was much anxiety throughout the non-Communist world aboutthe future course of international events and a general desire for a lead
from the United Kingdom. By his balanced and hopeful references to future relations with the Communist bloc; by his emphasis on the positive role which India and other uncommitted commonwealth countries can play in world affairs, through setting an example of individual freedom and upholding parliamentary institutions; byemphasising the United Kingdom Governments determination to keepthe British economy on a sound footing and to maintain the strengthof sterling; and by declaring the United Kingdom&apos;s intention to retain besides the capacity to contribute to the nuclear deterrent substantialland, sea and air forces East of Suez (and thus the ability to act independently if required in the event of any kind of limited emergency);the Prime Minister demonstrated the will and power of Britain to useher influence in the world for humane and beneficent purposes.(iii) Great attention was paid throughout the tour to public relations. In undersix weeks the Prime Minister delivered 34 major public addressesand broadcasts, besides making many minor impromptu speeches. Hisaddresses and broadcasts were carefully designed in each country tocover between them all the major appropriate themes. The PrimeMinister addressed a number of Press Conferences, both formal andinformal, besides meeting individual Pressmen informally on many other occasions, and always dealt fully and patiently with all questions. Asa result Press, radio and television coverage throughout the tour wasexceptionally full and in the main very favourable.(iv) As the High Commissioners all say in their despatches, the tour was a personal triumph for the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan,who inspired friendship and respect (and a sense of warmth andexhilaration) wherever they went. Many of the Prime Ministersspeeches touched his hearers very deeply.6. The Prime Ministers journey was not originally planned as a tour of fiveCommonwealth countries, but developed into this out of an invitation to visitAustralia. As the first Commonwealth tour by a United Kingdom Prime minister it has established a precedent to which those who plan future visits will doubtlesslook for guidance. A word of caution for the future may not therefore be out ofplace. Five and a half weeks is a longer period of absence from the UnitedKingdom than any Prime Minister is ever likely to find convenient. Yet this period,while providing sufficient time to do justice to New Zealand and the four Easternstates of Australia, allowed only four days in India, four in Pakistan, and less than two in Ceylon. Successful as were the Prime Ministers visits to these three last-mentioned countries, even better results could have been secured if the visits hadbeen longer. When a Commonwealth tour of this kind is next undertaken, it maybe prudent to proceed on the basis of a visit to a particular region, rather than toattempt to squeeze into so short a period visits to so many different countries.Regions which suggest themselves are South Asia (India, Pakistan, Ceylon); South-East Asia and the South Pacific (Malaya, Australia, New Zealand); Africa (Ghana,the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Union of South Africa, and indue course Nigeria); and America (Canada, and in due course the West Indies).
PART IICOMMENTARY ON THE VISITS TO EACH COUNTRYINDIAThe Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy were received in India with greatwarmth and cordiality, not only by members of the Government but also by thepeople of Delhi (and of the nearby country district which the Prime Ministervisited). There was an unmistakable spontaneity and depth about this popularwelcome. It seemed that the Prime Minister^ visit had touched a source of latentgoodwill, which had been awaiting this moment to find expression. The cryheard at one point from a member of the crowd (&quot; Once they were our rulers,now they are our friends &quot;) expressed the deep feelings which the visit evoked.In a message at the time to the Lord Privy Seal, the Prime Minister said he feltthat there were two reasons for this: first, many Indians now realised how wellthe British had treated them, and how differently from any ordinary colonialPower; secondly, many Indians felt that the British people themselves were anxiousto accept the new and creative relation of free partnership with India withoutqualms or regret. This new relationship was effectively symbolised by this firstvisit to India, since Independence, of a British Prime Minister in office.2. In their talks with the Prime Minister, the Indian leaders from Mr. Nehrudownwards showed no disposition to rake over recent disagreements.3. The Prime Ministers talks with Mr. Nehru were frank and intimate.Mr. Nehru later summed them up by saying: &quot; It is true we do not agree aboutsome matters, but the chief thing is to understand each other and to approachour problems in a friendly way. It is this friendly approach which makes all thedifference, and the Commonwealth association is most valuable because itencourages such friendly contacts.&quot;4. Mr. Nehru&apos;s own views on world affairs tended to be more doctrinairethan practical, save in matters directly affecting India&apos;s own interests, and therewas still the familiar but striking contrast between the high-minded advice whichhe gives to other Powers on major world issues, and the realism with which inpractice he conducts India&apos;s relations with her immediate neighbour. It wasremarkable how unwilling all the Indian leaders were to think of Pakistan in otherterms than as an irritant at best and at worst a major threat. No hint of any morestatesmanlike approach than this was discernible.5. It was apparent that Indian Ministers set much store on maintaining and developing the British commercial connection with India. Pandit Pant andMr. Morarji Desai both made it clear that they valued the contribution which theUnited Kingdom business community are making and can continue to make to indian prosperity, and that they were anxious that the British community shouldlive and work under conditions agreeable to them. The British business men whosaw the Prime Minister in Delhi said that the attitude of the Central government towards them was very friendly.6. The British business men were much concerned at the increasing holdwhich Communism is gaining over the Indian Trade Union movement, and at the weakness of the Government-supported unions in the I.N.T.U.C. Some of them also felt that Central Government leaders regarded the consolidation of communist rule in Kerala with a dangerous measure of complacency (thoughPandi Pant, for his part, thought opinion would &quot; continue to swing &quot; against the communists in Kerala). The British businessmen thought that the Congressmovement itself lacked impetus, cohesion and a central policy and was losingground. The High Commissioner thought it possible that, when Mr. Nehru went,Congress would split into a Left-Centre and .a Right-Centre party, and that thiswould be a healthy evolution since it would provide India with a constitutionalopposition: but there was no prospect of this political development for some timeto come.7. It was apparent that no evident or acknowledged successor to Mr. Nehrucan as yet be identified.
8. On the economic side Indian leaders stressed to the Prime Minister the vital importance of increasing India&apos;s food production, and of bringing to fruitionthe real core of Congress&apos;s programme for the people, namely the Five-Year Plan.They seemed to understand that, in her present economic difficulties, Britain&apos;sbest way of helping India is to preserve her capacity to repay India&apos;s sterling balances at full value.9. As regards future United Kingdom policy, two main conclusions onepolitical and one economic emerged from the Prime Ministers visit:  (a) It is essential for the United Kingdom and the West to keep India stable,strong, and non-Communist; for this purpose it is important politicallythat the Second Five-Year Plan should be substantially carried tnrough;and on this account the more foreign (but non-Communist) businessinvestment which takes place in India, the better.(b) Although India is uncommitted internationally to either side in the cold war, the Indian Government shares with the West agreement onfundamental aims and ideals and the common objective of maintainingpeace and building up prosperity on a basis of individual freedomand parliamentary government, rather than on the basis of totalitariancontrol. In view of this, India&apos;s role in the developing Commonwealthis of great and continuing value; and the success or failure of India&apos;efforts to make progress by democratic methods will have its effectalso on the future of democracy in other areas of South and South-east asia.PAKISTANIt was noticeable that in Karachi the Prime Minister was not greeted by thelarge public demonstrations of popular goodwill which were such a feature of his visit to Delhi. But, as other events of the tour amply showed, the apparentindifference of Karachi&apos;s welcome did not denote any absence of friendly feeling.And personal contacts with individuals were easier and more relaxed than in India.Official Indian Society in Delhi is a little intense; and, as the Prime Ministerremarked at the time, going from there to Karachi is rather like going from NorthOxford to the Dukeries.2. The frequency of political changes in Pakistan, and the apparentprecariousness of the present constitutional regime, are in part the products of thespecial difficulties under which Pakistan was formed. The continuing characterof Pakistani political difficulties was discussed very frankly with the Prime minister by President Iskander Mirza, who towers more than ever above the other political leaders. President Mirza declared that he was determined to continue to actconstitutionally short of a Communist Government in Pakistan, which he would never allow.3. Behind the political turmoil there is much that is sound and steady in pakistan, particularly the Armed Services. The Prime Minister saw something ofthe Pakistan Navy and Air Force in Karachi and, on his visit to the Khyber, hada glimpse of the Pakistan Army, which is the largest of the three Services and provides the major element of stability in the country at large. There was muchheartening proof of the continuing value which the Pakistan armed forces attach to the traditional links which bind them to their British counterparts notwithstanding the substantial role which the United States has assumed in this field as the provider of great amounts of military aid.4. Whereas in India the difficulty, during the Prime Ministers visit, had been to induce the leaders to discuss Indo-Pakistan differences, in Pakistan Ministersseemed able to think and talk of little else. Doubtless this reflects Pakistani acuteconsciousness of being at a disadvantage, as the weaker antagonist, in all herdisputes with India, and her consequent strong desire for outside support especially from the United Kingdom and the United States, whether inside or outside SEATO and the Baghdad Pact. Of the five matters chosen by Mr. Noonfor detailed discussion with the Prime Minister, three (Kashmir, Canal Waters andArms Supply) directly related to Pakistani difficulties with India, and a fourth(Gwadur) is also felt by the Pakistanis to have been greatly aggravated by India.Mr. Noon accepted good-humouredly and without bitterness the firmly expressedadvice which the Prime Minister offered him, particularly on Arms Supply and
Gwadur. He nevertheless pressed very hard for a loan or grant of Canberrabombers, and for a United Kingdom declaration of readiness to come to the aid of India or Pakistan, should either country be attacked.5. These discussions (which could not have been conducted in a more direct and forthright manner) undoubtedly cleared the air. The High Commissioner(Sir Alexander Symon) has since reported that had it achieved nothing else thePrime Minister^ visit would have been justified by the frank meeting of mindswhich took place over these topics which lie uppermost at present in the thoughts of the Pakistan Government.6. It was notable that (with the exception of cotton) no economic or financialsubject was included among those discussed. But Mr. Amjad Ali, Pakistani active and capable Finance Minister, was away abroad throughout the Prime Ministersvisit, and it is probable that a number of economic points would have been raisedhad he been present. The British businessmen who saw the Prime Minister on14th January gave accounts of the Pakistan economy from their respectiveviewpoints, which in sum made a somewhat gloomy impression (the HighCommissioner has since said that he regards the impression which was thus createdat this meeting as to some extent unbalanced and incomplete); but the PrimeMinister put the matter in perspective when he told the British businessmen thatit was in many ways remarkable that Pakistan had done so well in spite of hermany difficulties.   As he saw it, the three main tasks now to be faced were:  (i) the proper utilisation of land;(ii) a more extended application of water; and(iii) above all, increased agricultural productivity.He hoped, too, that Pakistan would come to appreciate the value of foreign capital:it was foolish to want it and yet at the same time knock it about.CEYLONThe visit to Ceylon lasted for less than forty-eight hours. This was certainlytoo short. An afternoon, two nights and a day, are not enough in which to(a) gauge the local situation, (b) meet the key leaders, (c) hold business talks,(d) see something of the country, and (e) do justice to the resident British community.Of these objectives, (a)-(d) were all achieved, during this first visit to Ceylon by aBritish Prime Minister in office, though in a somewhat rushed and confusingmanner; (e) was not achieved.2. Within the limited time available the visit, though highly concentrated,went smoothly. In the considered subsequent opinion of the High Commissioner(Mr. A. F. Morley) it was a real success both at the popular level and amongthinking people. Certain of the visifs features such as the State Drives to andfrom the airport, and the visit to Kandy have become a standard ingredient ofthe programmes which are arranged for the highest category of V.I.P. visitors to ceylon. Mere stage-management would not, however, have produced the genuinespontaneity and warmth of the popular welcome which the Prime Minister wasgiven. Doubtless, in part, this reflected the natural gaiety and geniality of thepeople in Ceylon (where the struggle for existence is so much less grim than in theIndo / Pakistan sub-continent). But, as in India, there seemed also to be a specialelement of friendliness for the British, who were once Colonial rulers and arenow Commonwealth partners; and this was perhaps not altogether unmixed, atany rate among older people, with a trace of nostalgia for what were in many waysbetter and more hopeful days.3. Two events were included in the Prime Minister^ programme which donot form part of the standard arrangements for V.I.P. visitors, namely theParliamentary Dinner and the conferment of an honorary degree of the university of Ceylon. The Prime Minister made telling use of the opportunity which bothoccasions afforded to underline the unique and abiding character of Ceylon&apos;s links with Britain in the Parliamentary and educational field. (That so many of thebest minds of the older generation in Ceylon should have been furnished at oxford and Cambridge with social, cultural and political ideas is an asset of considerable,but diminishing, importance in the somewhat unsatisfactory general situation whichis discussed below.)
4. The Prime Minister found Ceylon in an uneasy and unstable condition,both externally and internally. The scale and visour of the Russian effort in Ceylonwas apparent (M. Yakovlev, the Soviet Ambassador, is shrewd and affable,supported by a numerous staff, and clearly on close terms with Mr. Bandaranaike).The effort of Communist China is also substantial. In turning to neutralism,Mr. Bandaranaike and his Government may prove to have invoked forces which Iso small and soft a nation as the Ceylonese lack the capacity to manage.Domestically, the Government is at sixes and sevens. Overseas confidence in the regime is low. The only port (Colombo) is subject to crippling delays. To thisdepressing scene, there had been added, three weeks earlier, a severe naturaldisaster in the shape of heavy floods in the north-east part of the island.5. The Ceylon leaders evidently saw in Mr. Macmillan&apos;s visit an opportunityto turn the recent flood disaster to advantage, and at once asked for substantiallong-term help (for which they were quite unable to produce any facts and figures in justification). There was a certain alacrity about the way in which they took the opportunity to pass the begging-bowl (it has since been firmly offered to anumber of other countries also); and it was not hard to see that Ceylon*s presentrulers have much in mind the possibility, which they think their new neutralistrole has opened up for them, of exploiting their nuisance value as an &quot;uncommitted &quot;country and of squeezing the West (and doubtless Russia and China also) for all they can get.6. There was a certain crudity, also, about Sir Oliver Goonetilleke&apos;suggestion that Mr. Bandaranaike (&quot; the best bet in Asia ,?) was anxious to separatehimself from the less satisfactory elements on which he had hitherto had to rely,and in return for value received from the United Kingdom would be ready tomove to the right.7. The Prime Minister countered Mr. Bandaranaike&apos;s requests by offering to double the  10,000 which the United Kingdom had already given to help towards meeting immediate needs, and beyond that to give Ceylon whatever technical helpshe might need from the United Kingdom in framing and carrying through a programme of resettlement and reconstruction. The Prime Minister announcedthese offers in his speech on 17th February at the Parliamentary Dinner, and referredto them again in his farewell message to Mr. Bandaranaike.8. In his talk with Mr. Bandaranaike the Prime Minister took the currenttroubles of Indonesia as his text, and went on to stress pointedly the wisdom forall underdeveloped countries of pursuing policies which encourage a sense of security for overseas capital rather than drive the foreign investor to lookelsewhere. The Prime Minister developed the same theme in his publicspeech at the Parliamentary Dinner. His remarks were loudly applauded.Sir Oliver Goonetilleke remarked later, in answer to a question by Mr. Morley.that &quot; the Members were of course delighted to hear these things said in public provided that they did not have to say them themselves.&quot;9. The Prime Minister^ visit to Ceylon cannot have failed to stimulateCommonwealth feeling, and will thus have helped to offset some of the high-poweredwooing to which Ceylon had been subjected of late from the Communist bloc.Nothing in the present situation of Ceylon, bad though it is, suggests that it need beregarded from the Western countries&apos; point of view as irretrievable. In the new circumstances, however, some upward adjustment may well be needed in Western and particularly United Kingdom representational and other effort in the island.NEW zealand in planning how the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy should spend theireight days in New Zealand, those responsible in the New Zealand government took as a model the different Royal Visits which had preceded, and were so soon to follow, the Prime Minister^. Accordingly, less than two days were spent inWellington; the rest of the time was devoted to visiting people and places else wherein the North and South Islands. Though well suited to the purposes of a purelygoodwill tour, this arrangement allowed only the minimum of time in which thePrime Minister could have business talks with Mr. Nash and other New ZealandMinisters.    But New Zealand  people welcomed  the  Prime  Minister  and
Lady Dorothy, in the many centres both large and small where they went, with interest, friendship and as the visit developed growing personal affection. there could be no doubt of the quiet but abiding fervour with which New Zealandersregard their relations with the Old Country, and they took full advantage of the chance to show this. These are substantial human gains, which would not havebeen so fully achieved if the visit had been planned solely with an eye to the ministerial talks in Wellington, and hence had allowed less time to see people and places elsewhere in New Zealand.2. At the time of the visit the Labour Party of New Zealand had been returned to power at a General Election less than two months eariier with a majorityover the National Party Opposition of only two. Apart from Mr. Nash, theCabinet lacked experience and were still settling into their Portfolios and muchpreoccupied with details of their jobs. They were bound by election promisesto give concessions to the electorate in income tax and social benefits and hadinherited a formidable and rapidly worsening adverse balance of external payments.While there are no political issues between New Zealand and the United Kingdom,and the Labour Party is firm in loyalty to the United Kingdom and Commonwealth,Ministers and people alike were much occupied with New Zealand&apos;s economic problems. There was some suspicion of the United Kingdoirfs part in promotingeconomic integration in Europe. New Zealanders feared that this might in theend commit the United Kingdom to accepting from Europe agricultural producewhich she had always bought from New Zealand. Finally, there was someresentment at the lower prices fetched by New Zealand meat and dairy produce and at the United Kingdom&apos;s alleged toleration of increased imports, even tothe extent of dumping, from foreign countries.3. There was, as it proved, just enough time for the Prime Minister to address the New Zealand Cabinet, and in separate discussions with Mr. Nashand the other Ministers concerned to cover the subjects, economic and political,which were uppermost in the minds of members of the New Zealand Government.Much was achieved in these business talks. On political matters there was a valuable meeting of minds between the Prime Minister and Mr. Nash, who(notwithstanding his long exclusion from office, and his tendency on majorinternational questions to take a somewhat naive and individual line of his own)showed himself very ready to accept practical advice, as for example over thequestion whether or not to recognise the Chinese People&apos;s Government. two points which the Prime Minister made strongly were especially welcome toMr. Nash. The first of these was the Prime Minister^ vigorous assurance thatthe United Kingdom valued, and in no way sought to abridge or diminish, NewZealand&apos;s special ANZUS relationship with America. As the High Commissioner(Sir George Mallaby) has since confirmed, Mr. Nash was also much struck by thePrime Minister^ assessment of the major role which India, as the world&apos;s largestParliamentary democracy, is playing and can continue to play in the commonwealth and in Asia.4. Mr. Nash and the other Ministers were greatly concerned with NewZealand&apos;s current balance of payments difficulties, and appeared resolutelydetermined to pursue to the end their desire to modify the Ottawa tariff margins,so as (they hoped) to increase New Zealand&apos;s chances of marketing her primaryproduce elsewhere than in the United Kingdom, and with the object of reducingcosts of production in New Zealand by getting easier access to the cheapestsources of supply. New Zealand Ministers expressed great concern also at thelow prices which New Zealand dairy products were currently fetching in theBritish market, and pressed strongly for action to be taken by the United kingdom under the anti-dumping legislation which had recently been passed at Westminster.On the two subjects which were later to bulk largest in the Prime Ministers economic discussions at Canberra viz., the European Free Trade Area project, and thefuture of sterling New Zealand Ministers did not seem to be unduly concerned.Nor (perhaps since it would weaken New Zealand&apos;s case for special treatment ondairy products) were Mr. Nash or his colleagues anxious to discuss in detailways of improving still further the successful competitive showing which NewZealand meat is making in the United Kingdom market. The selectivity whichthey thus displayed, in emphasising the unfavourable elements in their position,and playing down the favourable ones, was, as the Prime Minister gently remindeda public audience at Christchurch, characteristic of farmers all over the world.
5. To neither of the main economic conundrums which were propoundedto him was the Prime Minister able (nor, indeed at any rate by Mr. Nash washe expected) to promise solutions out-of-hand. New Zealand Ministers on thewhole received with good grace his offers of (i) early discussions in London onthe tariff point, and (ii) assistance if required to New Zealand in preparing thenecessary case as a preliminary to action under GATT against Continental dumping!of dairy products in the United Kingdom. &quot;6. Both the New Zealand Ministers concerned, and the leaders of thedifferent primary producers&apos; interests (particularly dairying), to whom the PrimeMinister gave a full and patient hearing in Wellington and elsewhere, were glad of the opportunity to bring these problems to the Prime Ministers attention, withthe promise which that entailed of being able to enlist his personal interest and sympathy in London should that prove (in their judgment) necessary at a later date.7. In his public speeches the Prime Minister emphasised the major rolewhich British private investment is playing in New Zealand; explained the policybehind the European Free Trade Area proposal; and encouraged New Zealandproducers, particularly of meat, to seek actively the wider opportunities stilloffered by the United Kingdom market. He also spoke strongly in public ofthe desirability of Commonwealth countries developing their own firm links withthe United States, and of the complete compatibility of this with membership ofthe Commonwealth family (this statement was received with particular pleasureby the United States authorities). The Prime Minister took the opportunity,too, to open the door to wider horizons in Commonwealth relations than are as yet generally perceived by the New Zealand public by stressing the role in world affairs of India and other new Commonwealth members.8. As he travelled round New Zealand the Prime Minister was impressed by the fact that, although no country could be further away from Britain, therewas none which resembled Britain more closely. This applied both to the natureof the country itself and to the character and traditions of its people. Over thelast twenty years there has been a good deal of industrial development, mainly in light industry. As compared with Australia, New Zealand seemed however to be a relatively static society. The New Zealanders themselves combine withtheir many outstanding qualities a touch of smugness and a somewhat parochialoutlook. They seem to regard their traditional livelihood as something to be guaranteed them in all circumstances, and show little readiness to adapt themselvesto new conditions; in the last resort this perhaps reflects the narrow range oftheir country&apos;s resources. This last criticism is probably more true of NewZealand&apos;s politicians than of her businessmen, who are indeed less parochial than are her Ministers.AUSTRALIAMr. Menzies&apos; public verdict on the Prime Ministers visit to Australia was thatit had been beyond all question a wonderful success. The United Kingdom HighCommissioner (Lord Carrington) considers that the visit gave the United kingdom great boost both with Australian Ministers and the general public. Mr. Macmillanreceived a notable welcome from the latter, which was particularly striking inBrisbane and Melbourne. Full Press and radio coverage of the Prime Ministersactivities and speeches was sustained throughout the tour, and leading articles were very friendly. Senior officials in Canberra commented privately that no previoustour by any overseas visitor, other than members of the Royal Family, had createdsuch a deep and favourable impression.2. The Prime Ministers programme in Australia was imaginatively arranged by those responsible in Canberra. No detail was left to chance. It allowed timein which to visit the four Eastern States (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoriaand Tasmania), and also to hold two sets of business talks in the federal Capital.Much-needed rest was also provided for during the two weekends. Any shorter period than a full fortnight would not have been enough to meet all these purposes,or to make a full impact. As it was, Western Australia and South Australia (to say nothing of the Northern Territory) were not visited, and thus have a claim for special consideration when any such tour is undertaken in the future.
3. At the time of the visit the Liberal-Country Party Coalition government under Mr. Menzies had been in office for eight years. The Oppositions record hadnot been impressive and there had been a good deal ot* dissatisfaction withdraw. Evatt&apos;s leadership. Moreover, the Opposition was still weakened by the feudbetween the Australian and Democratic Labour Parties. These factors were boundto reduce the chances of Labour being returned to office at the General Election,which it seemed would probably take place in December 1958. The standing ofMr. Menzies and his Government in the country was however by no means assured,and, particularly if unemployment continued to increase, the result of the Electioncould not be regarded as a foregone conclusion. The antagonism between theGovernment and the Opposition, normally more acute in Australia than in Britain,&apos;was already on the increase in view of the nearness of the Election. Hence Dr. Evattdid what he could to use his interview with the Prime Minister for his own partyadvantage and to deprecate the final joint Press Conference between Mr. Macmillanand Mr. Menzies. Immediately before Mr. Macmillan&apos;s arrival Dr. Evatt had mademigration a political issue, urging in particular an increased proportion of migrationfrom Britain; and the Press and public accordingly showed much interest in thissubject during the visit.4. The Prime Ministers address on international questions to the AustralianCommonwealth Cabinet was welcomed as a unique opportunity to hear fromMr. Macmillan in person how he saw world affairs and interpreted his own recentand future part in them. Of the four other Ministerial discussions, one was between mr. Macmillan and Mr. Menzies alone save for a single accompanying official from either side; the remaining three meetings were all attended by from three to sixCommonwealth Ministers other than Mr. Menzies. It was evident that Mr. Menzieswas anxious to give as many as possible of his colleagues the opportunity of frankdiscussion at first-hand with Mr. Macmillan, and a substantial meeting of mindstook place on a fairly wide range of subjects. There was every sign that Mr. Menziesand other Australian Ministers appreciated the opportunity for these talks and foundthem very useful.5. During these talks the Prime Minister, by skilfully-applied shock tactics,brought the Australian Government to agree in principle to pay their share of thecapital costs of building a cantonment at Malacca for the land forces which Britain,Australia and New Zealand are contributing to the Commonwealth strategic reserve. (This vexatious problem had long been hanging fire hitherto.) Othersatisfactory features of the talks were (i) Australian acceptance of the Prime Ministers offer to take up with president Eisenhower the possibility of holding joint militarydiscussions, perhaps initially on a United Kingdom/United States basis,about the defence of South-East Asia; and(ii) Mr. Menzies&apos; reaffirmation of sympathy and support for the general objectives of a European Free Trade Area.Mr. Menzies recognised that strong pressures were likely to be exerted on theUnited Kingdom over agricultural imports (&quot; There are no absolutes in politics &quot;).He and other Ministers concerned urged strongly that if, as might well happen, quickAustralian consent were sought for a particular move by the United Kingdom tomeet this pressure, Australia must be able to see the point in the context of the totalbargain and must therefore have been kept most fully informed of the course of theFree Trade Area negotiations as they proceeded.6. The discussion on Antarctica ended inconclusively, but in a manner which left open the possibility of the United Kingdom making further efforts to convinceAustralia of the desirability of some international regime.7. Economic questions of bilateral United Kingdom/ Australian concern, suchas the working of the Meat Agreement, shipping, and the prices of Australianprimary exports, were not raised. Mr. Menzies had let it be known among hiscolleagues in the Commonwealth Government that he would not have subjectsraised with the Prime Minister unless they were of major importance, and (wxcept perhaps in respect of migration and of some of the points brought forward on international affairs) this aim was fully achieved.8. In his public speeches and Press Conferences, the Prime Minister spoke (asin New Zealand) of the great value which the United Kingdom attaches toAustralia^ special ANZUS link with America, and of the complete compatibility of
this relationship with Australia^ Commonwealth ties. He stressed the importanceof India&apos;s role in the developing Commonwealth, and emphasised the significance ofa Commonwealth association whose members were united by their common belief inthe principles of Parliamentary democracy and individual liberty; and he indicated the importance of the role which this unique association could play in the worldstruggle between the forces of tyranny and the forces of freedom. He declaredBritain&apos;s intention to retain substantial land, sea and air forces in South-East Asia,and emphasised that the British Far East Fleet would continue to be based in singapore. It was notable that at no time during the visit was any criticism made,either privately by Ministers or publicly in the Press, of Britain&apos;s contribution onthe defence of South-East Asia. On the other hand, there was considerablespeculation suggesting that the Prime Minister was pressing the australian government to increase its defence contributions. In reply to questions at his finalPress Conference Mr. Macmillan said that he was very satisfied with the Australianmilitary effort in Malaya. The Prime Minister took every opportunity to underlinethe fact that since 1946 the United Kingdom had provided two-thirds of the private capital that had come into Australia; but he also spoke frankly about the need for developing countries to follow policies which attract, and do not repel, private investment from all overseas sources including in particular the United States. Hetraversed Australia^ trade links with the United Kingdom, and explained that no british Government could allow home agriculture to decline. He mentionedBritish advances in science and technology, and pointed out the expandingopportunities to which these were leading in Britain itself (&quot; I thought you would liketo know in Australia that the old Mother Country is still quite a girl &quot;). On migration(in Australia a subject of deep popular interest and some concern not all of it veryrational), he assured Australians that it was the British Governments wish in every possible way to help Australia to remain British in blood and tradition.9. The Prime Ministers statements on all these topics were warmly received.Australians welcomed in particular his assurance on migration, and his evidentappreciation of the value of British investment to their country. The pace of australian industrial development, the potentialities still to be explored, and thescale of the achievements already made, seemed to show that in adding to the alreadyimpressive amount of British effort in Australia, a land of expanding horizons andbuoyant people, the United Kingdom would be helping to reinforce one of the most successful countries in the Commonwealth.10. In Lord Carrington&apos;s words, before the visit many Australians had beenfeeling some concern about Britain and her place in the counsels of the world, andhad had doubts about the ability of the Western nations to provide effectiveinternational leadership. The visit reassured Australians that the United kingdom had a leader of world stature, and that in the Prime Minister of the United Kingdomthey had a man who had seen their country for himself, who understood &quot;theirachievements and sympathised with their aspirations.SINGAPOREThe Prime Minister&apos;s second visit to Singapore on 12th February afforded himan opportunity to have a brief discussion with Mr. Lim Yew Hock, the chief minister, to hold a Press Conference and to have a drive round the city.2. There was at one time a fear that the Prime Ministers spending in all two days at Singapore (one day on each journey) would make the Federation of Malayafeel that they had been left out of what was after all a tour of commonwealth countries. On his return journey, however, the Prime Minister sent a message tothe Tunku and received a reply which dissipated these fears.3. Mr. Lim gave an impression of calm in the face of the forthcoming local and later general elections. He seemed to be genuinely concerned that the communists should be prevented from getting power in Singapore rather than that political power or advantage should necessarily accrue to him or to his party.He said to the Prime Minister that, having granted a measure of self-governmentto the people of Singapore, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should leave them to workout their own salvation. Any statement by Her Majesty&apos;s Government that theywould not allow a Communist Government to overthrow established institutions
in Singapore would be defeatist; this was a matter for the people of Singaporethemselves. The Prime Minister agreed with these sentiments. There was agood deal of gloomy talk among British businessmen in Singapore about theconsequences of what they regarded as a premature surrender of power to singapore.4. The drive round Singapore was a success. The Prime Minister and lady Dorothy Macmillan visited the town hall and signed the visitors&apos; book there.Not long before, the Mayor of Singapore had indulged in acts of discourtesy tothe Crown. The Prime Minister however behaved towards him with courtesy thatappeared to embarrass him. The Prime Minister saw as much of the city as waspossible during a two hour drive and was impressed by the amount and high standard of the new building that was going on. People gathered everywhereon the pavements to watch him pass but the crowds were particularly dense inChinatown. The Prime Minister was received everywhere with a welcominginterest.

PART IVPRESS arrangements the Press of all five countries gave full and favourable coverage to the Prime$ Ministers visit.2. It is fair to claim that this resulted largely from the willingness of thePrime Minister to see the Press at all the principal centres visited and, of course,to the impact he made on them.Press Conferences3. There were &quot; national &quot; Press conferences in India, Pakistan, Ceylon and singapore. The conference in India proved the most difficult despite expectationsthat it would be &quot; friendly,&quot; since all the running was left to a few Communistjournalists. However, the more responsible journalists possibly in reaction tothis undercurrent of hostility gave the conference very full and accurate coverage,and the result, as reflected in the principal newspapers, was entirely satisfactory.4. In New Zealand and Australia the position was complicated by the highlylocalised nature of the Press in the various cities and St&amp;tes. Nevertheless anopportunity for nation-wide coverage was provided in both countries through theParliamentary Press Gallery, and in Wellington and Canberra the Prime minister made a point of meeting members of the Press Gallery, not only in a press conference but also socially. These meetings undoubtedly created an excellentimpression.5. The problem of meeting the needs of the State newspapers in Australiawas met largely by airport conferences on arrived at Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourneand Hobart. In New Zealand an airport conference was held in Auckland. the airport conferences were usually held in difficult physical circumstances since none of the airports possessed special Press interviewing rooms. These conferences allbegan with a brief statement by the Prime Minister, recorded for broadcasting (andin Sydney and Melbourne for television) followed by questions from the Press. Thewhole process took from twenty minutes to half an hour.6. In New Zealand there were, in addition to the airport conference atAuckland, conferences at Wellington, Dunedin and Christchurch. To the problemof parochialism was added that of morning and evening paper rivalry in each city.Pressures were exerted from both sides to secure the most convenient liming of conferences, but these pressures had to be resisted and those times selected whichbest suited the Prime Ministers programme: however, a rough-and-ready justicewas achieved as between the two sides.7. Movie cameras and still photographers were usually at liberty to functionat will at airport conferences, but some efforts were usually made in otherconferences to limit these facilities to a period at the outset.8. Arrangements had been made in all instances for a verbatim note to betaken or for tape recordings to be made. These transcripts were invaluable as ahelp to the Press, for cabling to London and for later reference.Briefing9. For all these Press conferences thorough briefing was undertaken. EachHigh Commissioner had been asked in advanced forecast probable questions andto put up material for the replies. With the help of this information it was possible,usually in the aircraft immediately before arrival, to put together a full brief. Inno instance was a question asked which had not been anticipated. It was alsousual to prepare in the aircraft the brief statement to be made by the Prime minister on arrival.United Kingdom Correspondents10. Special attention was paid to ensuring full and accurate reporting of the tour in the United Kingdom and overseas generally. Three British correspondentstravelled the whole way (T. F. Thompson of the Daily Mail, Anthony Sampson,of the Observer and Stephen Barber of the News Chronicle) and one (Sydney Smith
of the Daily Express) travelled as far as Australia. In addition, The Timescorrespondent in Delhi, Roger Toulmin, covered the whole of the Asian section ofthe tour and The Times Australian correspondent, Stewart Harris, covered thewhole of the Australian section of the tour. The B.B.C. arranged for their Delhirepresentative to cover the Asian section of the tour and for their Singaporerepresentative to cover the Australasian section. Reuters relied on theircorrespondents in the respective countries. In Australia^ one correspondent,Warren White, was allocated by the Australian Associated Press, to cover the wholeof the Australian section on behalf of Reuters.11. Special arrangements were made for this group of correspondents to seethe Prime Minister from time to time for informal and non-attributable talks. Avery good spirit and understanding with the group resulted, and much of thefulland favourable United Kingdom reporting stemmed from this.Texts12. Also to ensure the fullest and most accurate possible reporting,arrangements were made for the texts of the Prime Minister^ principal speechesto be cabled immediately to the Commonwealth Relations Office and the central office of Information both for feeding to the United Kingdom Press and for use inthe London Press Service. This often involved the United Kingdom InformationOfficer in a considerable effort since on all but a few occasions no text was availableuntil immediately before the Prime Minister spoke, and then only two or threecopies could be made available to the Press for checking against delivery. In mostinstances, also, the Prime Minister departed in a greater or lesser degree from the text. It was necessary, therefore, as with the Press conferences, to make special arrangements for taking an official note of speeches and for these notes to betranscribed and cabled as quickly as possible after the event. The differences between local and United Kingdom times helped in this. The local Press usuallygrumbled at the absence of an adequate number of copies for the Press table butseemed to arrive at amicable arrangements for sharing the one or two copiesavailable. They were also given access afterwards to the official note.Lady Dorothy13. It remains to note that Lady Dorothy helped Press relations greatly by her willingness to meet women reporters at all the principal centres the party visited.

C^o  12-3/26 TOP SECRET   fi^ff^Miy  &amp;Appendix B fe*       I ^O.RECORDS  OF  DISCUSSIONS  WITH  THE PRIME  MINISTERS ANDOTHER  MINISTERS OF THE COUNTRIES  VISITEDINDIARecord of Conversation between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom andMr. Pandit Pant (Minister of Home Affairs), India, on 9th January, 1958Mr. Pandit Pant, the Minister of Home Affairs, called on the Prims Ministerat 10-30 a.m. on 9th January.The conversation, which lasted for half-an-hour, was in very general terms.No specific issues were raised on either side.Mr. Pant spoke of India&apos;s great problem of increasing food production to match her rapidly increasing population. This was an illustration of the magnitude of Indius economic problems. It would be many decades before these could be solved. Meanwhile, it was hard to satisfy public opinion, which was impatient of delay in increasing living standards.The Prime Minister asked about the political situation in Kerala. Mr. Pantsaid that, although the Communist Government had so far refrained from introducing any spectacular changes, thee was reason to believe that the people were dissatisfied with some of the measures they had introduced. The Christiancommunity, in particular, had been alienated by the new Education Bill; anddiscontent was also spreading among the industrial workers and the workers on theplantations. Two by-elections were due to be held in the near future; and it wouldbe possible to judge, by the results of these, whether there had been any substantialshift of public opinion against the Communist Government. He himself thoughtit likely that opinion would continue to swing against the Communists.Some general conversation followed about Parliamentary procedure, thesuccessful meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and theadvantages to be derived from international conferences and other opportunities for people of different countries to meet and discuss their common problems.At the end of the conversation Mr. Pant expressed the hope that the UnitedKingdom Government would not hesitate to bring to the notice of the Governmentof India any complaints there might be about the conditions under which membersof the United Kingdom community lived in India. He and the other members ofhis Government were most anxious that United Kingdom citizens should continueto be able to live and work in India under conditions which were agreeable tothem.New Delhi,9th January, 1958.Record of a Conversation Between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom andMr. Morarji Oesai (Minister of Commerce and Industry), India, on 9th January, 1958Mr. Morarji Desai, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, called on the PrimeMinister at I 1 a.m. on 9th January. In a conversation lasting for half-an-hour thefollowing specific points were raised:  (a) British Commercial Interests in india the Prime Minister said that he was anxious that the British business community in India should continue to play their part in the commercial development of the country. He was glad to think that the community had actuallygrown in numbers since independence, and that, the right type of young man was stillwilling to come out from the United Kingdom to follow a business career in India.He thought it important that the Government of India should avoid anything whichmight discourage this-particularly as regards taxation of individuals andjarrangements for remittances to the United Kingdom.Mr. Desai said that he was fully alive to the importance of this point and would]continue to keep it in mind. 1TOP SECRET I
(b) Cotton TextilesMr. Desai said that his Government attached great importance to thedevelopment of India&apos;s textile industries. Mill production was now running at a level of 5,000 million square yards a year. Hand-loom production from mill-spunyarn was about 1,600 million square yards a year. Production from hand-spun yarnand hand-weaving was now about 40 million square yards a year: but it was hopedthat this could be raised to about 300 million square yards over the next three orfour years. The organisation of this hand-made production had been built upprogressively since 1920, as a result of GandhPs initiative; and it was now beingexpanded substantially with the assistance of subsidies derived from taxation onmill production.Exports were a very small proportion of the total production-only about or 9 million square yards a year. The export trade was, however, of special importance to the mill industry especially at the present time, when domestic-demand had shrunk and heavy stocks were being carried.The Prime Minister said that he was anxious that some understanding shouldbe reached about the level of exports from India to the United Kingdom. Our owncotton industry in Lancashire was anxious about the competitive effect of importsfrom India, and were ready to discuss the possibility of some voluntary arrangement for limiting the level of imports. He understood that the Indian industry had been reluctant to enter into such discussions until the level of exports from Hong Konghad been fixed. On this point the United Kingdom Government were in some difficulty; for they were reluctant to enforce on a Colonial Government a limitationof their exports into the United Kingdom. They had hoped therefore that a voluntary arrangement might be reached between the textile industries of the UnitedKingdom, India and Pakistan on the basis that imports from India and Pakistaninto the United Kingdom would be limited to an agreed figure so long as importsfrom Hong Kong did not exceed a specified figure, il a voluntary agreement of thiskind should be made, the United Kingdom Government would do their utmost tosecure by all means short of compulsion, that imports from Hong Kong did notexceed that level. It would, however, be understood that, if that level were exceeded,&quot; all bets would be off &apos;* and the industries in India and Pakistan wouid be released from their obligation to conform to the agreement. He hoped that the indian government would do their utmost to persuade the Indian industry to enter into discussions with a view to the conclusion of a voluntary agreement on those lines.The Prime Minister promised to send Mr. Desai a written minute on this point.Mr. Desai undertook to consider, in the light of this, what further efforts could bemade to persuade the Indian industry to enter into these discussions.The Prime Minister told Mr. Desai that, in view of the continuing growth ofimports of cotton textiles into the United Kingdom from China, the United kingdom had now decided to take steps to limit future imports from that source to the levelof 1957. Arrangements were also being made to ensure that about 90 per cent, ofthose imports would be used for re-export. This decision would be made public on10th January.(c) Capital InvestmentSome general conversation followed on India&apos;? need for capita&apos; investment.The Prime Minister said that it was a feature of the modern world that the demandfor investment was far in excess of the rate of capital formation. All the peoples ofthe world wanted to enjoy the benefits which tlowed from investment, but they were unwilling to withhold from current consumption the savings required to make thenecessary capital available. This was a world-wide problem for which it was unlikely that any early or easy solution would be found.(cl) The Prime Minister expressed the hope that Mr. Desai would find an early-opportunity of paying a visit to the United Kingdom. Mr. Desai said that he would very much like to come, if bis Prime Minister were willing and if he could overcomepractical difficulties arising from his conscientious objection to vaccination, &amp;c. ThePrime Minister said that on the first point he would take an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Nehru.New Delhi,9th January, 1958.
Record of a Conversation between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdomand Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari (Minister of Finance), India, on 10th January,1958Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari, Minister of Finance, called on the Prime Ministerat 10-0 a.m. on 10th January. In the course of their conversation the followingpoints were raised :  (a) The Prime Minister explained the circumstances which had led to Mr.Thorneycroffs resignation. He stressed the fact that this would involve no changein the financial or economic policy of the Government who were determined to pursue with vigour their efforts to check inflation and maintain the stability of sterling.Mr. Krishnamachari said that on personal grounds he greatly regretted thisresignation as he felt that he had established a useful personal relationship withMr. Thorneycroft. He was the more sorry because he could not see that any greatquestion of principle was involved.(b) The Prime Minister summarised the contributions which the UnitedKingdom Government had been able to make towards the financing of India&apos;sdevelopment plans e.g., the Government credit of  15 millions and the loan of 1IV millions from United Kingdom banks towards the steel works at Durghapur,and the  18 millions released towards International Bank loans to India. India&apos;ssterling balances were, however, the main source of United Kingdom Governmentmoney available to India; and the best help that the United Kingdom could give toIndia at the present time was to keep the sterling area in a strong enough positionto take the strain imposed by the continued withdrawal of those balances.On this point. Mr. Krislmamachari said that he realised clearly that, if the pound were damaged, India&apos;s finances would be among the first to suffer and itwas therefore in India&apos;s interests as well as ours that her sterling balances shouldnot be drawn out at an excessive rate. He was keeping a watchful eye on this.From the financial point of view the year 1958-59 would be the most dillicultperiod of the Five-Year Plan: thereafter the position should become easier. If,therefore, he could get some financial help from Germany and the United Stateshe hoped that he would be able to slow down the rate of drawing on the sterling balances. He had not yet received any firm assurances from either Germany orthe United States, but he still hoped that some arrangements might be made with both.(c) As regards exports, Mr. Krishnamachari said that for the present Indiamust rely mainly on tea. jute and textiles. In the immediate future India&apos;s teaexports might profit from Ceylon&apos;s misfortunes for exports of Ceylon tea were likely to drop, not merely because of flood damage but mainly because of the prolonged strikes in the docks and elsewhere.. In the longer future he expectedthat steel would make an increasing contribution towards India&apos;s export earnings.(d) Mr. Krislmamachari said that India&apos;s economic future could betransformed by the development of atomic power. One of the main economic problems at present was the shortage of power. Hydro-electric schemes werepractical only in a few parts of the country; and production of electric power from coal was expensive because of the high cost of transporting coal over long distances.Some deposits of uranium had been found in Bihar; and he hoped that in thethird Five-Year Plan it might be possible to begin a more ambitious programmeof developing atomic energy for civil purposes.(e) Mr. Krishnamachari said that he was concerned about the possibility of.unemployment and unrest in Bengal.   Some Pakistani leaders were now makingstatements which might provoke some further movement of refugees into EastBengal where there were already two million unemployed; and this movement,if it &quot;we re resumed, would present India with a serious problem. On the general question of relations between India and Pakistan he said that, in the West, therewas no problem (save Kashmir) which was not capable of solution. The questionof the Indus waters was, in his judgment, one on which a compromise could bereached. The problems of East Pakistan, on the other hand, were moreintractable and trouble might develop there at any moment.New Delhi,10th January, 1958.
ecord of a Conversation between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdomand Mr. V. K. Krishna Menon (Minister of Defence), India, on 10th January.1958Mr. Krishna Menon, Minister of Defence, called to see the Prime Minister10-30 a.m. on 10th January. They had a purely general conversation, in whichcontroversial issues of any kind were raised. Mr. Menon spoke of his new duties as Minister of Defence. He explained that he had wide-rangingResponsibilities for administration not only of the Armed Forces but also of armsproduction, much of which was carried out in State-owned ordnance factories.Jn addition he had a great deal of Committee work, as Minister of Defence and.i)ver and above that, a new obligation to make political speeches on government policy generally.  He gave the impression that he had a great deal of work to do.I The conversation then turned on internal political problems e.g., the successfof the Communists in Kerala, the position of the Communist Party generalhthroughout India, the future of the Congress Party, &amp;c.Throughout this talk Mr. Menon made no attempt to refer to international affairs and that subject was not mentioned at any point. His conversation wasremarkably friendly in tone he raised no complaint of any kind on any subject&apos; and he himself appeared to be in much better health and quite relaxed.After the Prime Minister had left, Mr. Menon raised with me one specificissue, viz.. the supply to India of scientific information on defence questions. He.said that, since becoming Minister of Defence, he had divided the scientific workof his Department from the production work and i understood him to say thathe had appointed a new Scientific Adviser. He was anxious that this scientific adviser should be enabled to obtain more information from the United KingdomGovernment on defence research questions. He said that he was not of coui^econcerned to know anything about nuclear weapons. He was, however, interestedin other matters, and&quot; particularly in the development of guided missiles. he believed that on that subject we had much information which could be passed onto India without breach of any agreement between ourselves and the United States.He hoped that, on my return to London, I would consider whether arrangements could be made to withdraw any existing restrictions on the supply of such information to India. If necessary he would be glad to arrange for his scientific adviser to go over to London for discussion on this point. I undertook to look into this on my return.New Delhi,10th January, 1958.Note of a Meeting between the Secretary of the Cabinet and Heads of departments in New Delhi on 10th January, 1958Sir Raghavan Pillai asked if I would meet a number of Secretaries toGovernment and answer questions which they wished to put to me on matters ofCivil Service organisation. The meeting was held at I I - 30 a.m. on 10th January inthe Cabinet Secretariat, and lasted for about 1-4 hours. It was attended by abouta dozen Heads of Departments.Though it opened on the basis of question and answer, the meeting developed,as I hoped it would, into a general discussion on points of common concern totheir Service and to ours. It was an interesting and useful discussion. The maintopics covered were as follows:  (a) Recruitmenti; They were interested in the recent review, by the Civil Service Commission,of the comparative results of entry by the two methods of examination and selection.They had, I believe, a slight bias against Method II. They themselves still continueto recruit only by the old method of competitive examination and are, I think,likely to supplement this by anything on the lines of our Method II.b) Quality of New EntrantsThey are not dissatisfied with the standard of the candidates for theirdministrative services.  They said that, for every vacancy, they had about three

It was only in some parts ofIndia that industry was beginning to compete with the public service, as a career.Academic life was not yet a counter-attraction of any importance.(c) Whitley Council ProcedureThey are being pressed to introduce some kind of joint consultative machineryon the lines of our Whitley Council. Mr. Douglas Houghton had recently been to India and given them an account of the working of our machinery, as seen fromthe staff side. They wanted to balance this by getting my view of how it lookedfrom the official side. In particular they wished to know whether we thought itdesirable that Whitley Councils should have rights to intervene in individual cases,e.g.. promotion or discipline. I said that, if I were starting with a clean slate,I would much prefer that any joint consultative machinery should be limited togeneral questions (pay and conditions and principles to be observed in such matters as promotion and discipline) but should have no power to intervene in individual cases.Ui) CommunistsThey were anxious to know more about our procedure for excludingCommunists from key positions in the public service. Some of them were inclined to think that it would be convenient if Communists could be excluded from thepublic service altogether: but most of them recognised that this would not be practicable in a society which recognised Communism as a legitimate political party. Though I did not ask any direct questions about this, I imagine that theyhave as yet no procedure lor excluding Communists for Indian Ministers areinclined to take the line that Communists in India are reasonable people who canbe trusted not to behave as Communists do elsewhere and there is, moreover, oneIndian Province which has a Communist Government.(e) Parliamentary ControlThey were interested to know about the workings of the Public accounts committee and the Estimates Committee. It appeared from our discussion thatthey have much the same trouble with their Estimates Committee as we have with ours. They have a particular difficulty with the Estimates Committee, whichis inclined to seek formal evidence from retired members of the public service and, even worse, from serving members on subjects for which they are no longerresponsible. They also have special difficulty with enterprises which are ownedwholly or partly by the State: lor some public servants seconded to these are inthat capacity members of outside associations and may sometimes be summonedin that capacity to give evidence before Parliamentary Committees on subjects onwhich evidence has already been given by the responsible Department.(/) Political ActivitiesThey were anxious to know what rules applied in the border-line cases engaged on semi-industrial work e.g., the manipulative grades in the Post Oflice. were there any grades which were treated for some purposes as industrial and for othersas non-industrial? 1 said that in the United Kingdom the manipulative gradeswere all regarded as non-industrial and I explained the broad principles of theMasterman Report.(g) Financial ControlWe had a long discussion on the difficulties of delegating financial authorityto Departments. They are. it seems, anxious to go further in that direction inorder to simplify administration; but are worried lest this should involve lack of effective central control.They also asked a number of questions about our methods of controllingexpenditure by local authorities. They are concerned about their correspondingproblem of Federal control over State expenditure.They are also considering the possibility of carrying over voted monies fromone financial year to another there has evidently been Parliamentary criticism of under-spending or over-estimating.

TOP SECRET 31 This is the second occasion on which I have had a general talk of this kindwith Heads of Indian Departments. The above summary is designed to do no morethan list the subjects covered: it does not attempt to reflect the nature of thediscussion. I am confident that these contacts are of considerable value to bothsides, and we should certainly aim at renewing them whenever opportunity offers.(Sgd.)        NORMAN BROOK.New Delhi,11th January, 1958.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of the Cabinet andMr. M. O. Matthai (Personal Assistant to Mr. Nehru) on 10th January, 1958INDIA : TEACHING OF ENGLISHIn a private talk which I had with him yesterday Mr. M. O. Matthai (PersonalAssistant to Mr. Nehru) represented to me in the strongest possible terms thatthe United Kingdom Government should do more to further the teaching ofEnglish in India. He said that there were few links binding India to the rest ofthe Commonwealth-and by far the strongest of these was the common language.It was therefore of the greatest importance that English should continue to bethe second language-and for many people the only common language-in India.Many of the compulsions which had hitherto caused Indians to learn Englishhad, since independence, disappeared. The United Kingdom Government musttherefore make deliberate efforts to replace these-by a sustained attempt tofurther the teaching of English in Universities and schools throughout India.I told Mr. Matthai that we fully appreciated this need; we had recently decidedthat the teaching of English should be first priority among the objectives of theBritish Council in India and other Commonwealth countries in Asia. He expressedthe hope that we would do even more in this direction. There was no activityin India on which we could more profitably spend money than this.(Signed)      NORMAN BROOK.New Delhi,11th January, 1958.Note by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of his two Conversationswith Mr. Nehru on 8th and 11th January, 1958I had two long private conversations with Prime Minister Nehru. The firstwas on the evening of Wednesday, the 8th of January, the night of our arrival;the second on Saturday evening, January 11th, the night before our departure.At the first he did not raise any specific questions, nor did I do so myself.He seemed in a relaxed and reflective mood and most of his conversation concernedthe problems of India. Mr. Nehru&apos;s habits of thought and speech appear to bebecoming more and more discoursive. I am told he makes about four speechesa day and talks at great length at Cabinets and other gatherings, generally on oneor other of well-known themes.On the first night he explained the economic situation of India and the needto get on at all costs with the Second Five-Year Plan. I did not feel that he wasunder any misapprehension about our economic position and quite understoodthat we have made very considerable efforts to help. I pointed out that we hadnot only done this but had taken risks by giving loans on public and privateaccounts and with large export credits, having regard to our difficulties with sterlingin general. The most important thing we could do, I said, was to preserve ourpower to repay the balances at their full value. Incidentally, Mr. Desai andMr. Krishnamachari, whom I saw in the course of the next day or two, seemedto understand this too. TOP SECRET

It is clear to me from what Mr. Nehru said that the Five-Year Plan is absolutely essential for two reasons: first, Five-Year Plans are an essential feature of a developing community to-day. He is faced with the Communist pressure which is undoubtcdlv srowina in India, industrially as well as politically. He mustput up as nood a show as the Russians or the Chinese-perhaps the Chinese moreespecially because they are a community more similar in character to the Indians.The second reason is &quot;that the Congress Party is in a sense in the position of theIrish Party alter Home Rule-it cannot just live on the claim that it made therevolution. In the same way, the Whig Party could not continue indefinitely onfear of Jacobiteism. The Five-Year Plan is part of the new political attractionthe Congress Party is putting before the people and since it is in our interest toprevent Communism. I think we ought to do everything we can to help themwith the Five-Year Plan and encourage America and Germany to do the same.A serious breakdown in the Five-Year Plan would not be to our advantagecommercially, and certainly not politically.VIr. Nehru at this first meeting did not raise international affairs, except justto touch upon them. He gave me a long account of Indian village life: of the attempts to do something to improve the standard of the people (of which I wasto see an example the next day): the need for increasing food supplies; thedifficulties presented by a continually expanding population (every year theyadd about the population of London!: and so forth. Indian production per acrebeing very low there is in theory a considerable margin which could be filled. Butthis &quot;means fertilisers, and fertilisers mean power and transport and all the restof it. and so every problem is linked with another. Mr. Nehru believes that Indiamust always be and ought always to be a predominantly agricultural countryHowever far industrial civilisation went, something between 60 and 80 per cent of the people must be agricultural.Mr. Nehru, who is a curious mixture of advanced thought and old-fashionedopinions, deplored the Americanisation of India. He said that he was veryunpopular because he would not allow American dance bands and crooners onthe radio without there being a large proportion of Indian traditional music.He told me at this discussion something of his visit to China. He holdscertain theories about the division that may come between China and Russia,who are not spiritually, or even traditionally, friends, and there is always a gOuudeal of friction. He felt the Chinese position was forced upon them, as Maohad told him, by the fact that other countries would not trade with China on a bigscale, or lend her money.At the discussion on Saturday night we dined alone. He said that he had had a letter from Bulganin sending him a copy of his second letter to me, andthe annex. Bulganin had specifically asked Mr. Nehru to talk to me about this for he thought that the British were more inclined to try for settlementsproblems than the Americans. Mr. Nehru explained at great length butfamiliar lines his general position. He tried to argue in favour of suspension of nuclear tests, the abandonment of nuclear weapons, and all the rest of it andrefused to face the points I put to him about the danger to us of large-scaleconventional arms if nuclear arms were brought to an end. He has many falseviews about science and seems to believe in the possibility of any countryproducing nuclear weapons in a very short time, and professes to be very alarmedat this prospect. He said that somebody had told him you could makeH-bomb in your back garden.   I said that this was not our experience.He pressed very hard that we should take up the latest Bulganin proposals and at least organise a meeting. I said that I did not think the proposal for meeting of 30 or 40 Governments at Geneva was a serious proposal, but waspropaganda. At the same time 1 was myself very anxious to pin them downserious discussion of at least the preliminaries. My view was that the foreign secretaries, or perhaps even Ambassadors, ought to hold preliminary meetingsto devise an agenda, separate the problems, and all the rest of it. before any useful talks could be held at any level, and certainly at the so-called Summit levelMr. Nehru asked why we could not agree to the Polish proposals, or something of that kind. I said that we would certainly consider them. He thought thatthe Russians had no intention of going to war because war was unprofitableI said that war was only unprofitable if neither side could win: it woulddifferent if the balance of power were altered dramatically. He accepted this with very good temper and although he spoke more than I did he did not seem to be very put out at my points. 1 made them very deferentially and politely,but firmly.
At one point, when he spoke of the need for us to case tension between Eastand West, 1 pointed out the need for a common standard of these matters. Forinstance, I said there are two countries, India and Pakistan, closely allied by ties of kinship, who are now on the worst possible terms. India was wasting a greatdeal of money by unnecessary arms Hunters and Canberras from us. ThePakistanis were wasting money they could not afford on arms and even whenthey had them the cost of maintenance was stii! too heavy for them. And all this because each feared that the other would attack. How then did his generalpolicy apply?   He took this well, but blushed and seemed rather taken aback.This led to a short diversion about Kashmir. He said that it was impossibleto deal with the Pakistan Government they never stayed in office for more thana few months; they had no sound democratic system; there was nobody who couldsettle any agreement in fact he was net at all hopeful. I did not pursue thematter because I did not want to get involved in the familiar arguments aboutKashmir.The discussion lasted about three hours and was ail very friendly, but veryvague. I left him with the impression that I was as anxious as he was to get togrips with the Russians, and the problem was the right method of approach.Undoubtedly there is a good deal in what he says about the Russian desire to prove that their system is belter, and can win on its own merits. He firmlybelieves that Khrushchev is a more flexible and less bigoted politician than someof his predecessors. He also thinks that the character of Russian Communismis changing and that we under-rate the effect of the growth of a large class oftechnicians who now form an intelligentsia of a different kind, unwilling to acceptready-made creeds, and beginning to ask questions of their rulers.PAKISTANExtracts from Record of a Meeting between the Prime Ministers of the UnitedKingdom and Pakistan and other Pakistan Ministers and Officials held inKarachi on 14th January, 19581. KashmirMr. Macmillan asked the Pakistan Prime Minister what he felt about therecent Security Council discussions on Kashmir.Mr. Noon said that the Security Council was still pressing for a plebiscite inKashmir. This had the support of ten of the members but the Soviet Unionopposed it. The Pakistan Ambassador in Moscow believed that the SovietGovernment looked upon Kashmir as part and parcel of the cold war, and thatthey would obstruct a settlement so thai India and Pakistan would go onquarrelling. Russia had vetoed the use of an International Force in Kashmir.Their proposal was that the two parties should settle the dispute in direct talks.This meant that there would be no settlement, since none could be reached indirect talks between the strong and the weak.Mr. Macmillan asked if the Pakistan Prime Minister felt that the recentproceedings in the Security Council had helped. It seemed clear that they had notbeen agreeable to India.Mr. Noon said he was sure this was so. Even members of the general assembly who were not represented on the Security Council were becoming increasingly critical of India.Mr. Baig said that India was undoubtedly feeling the pressure of world opinion very&quot; acutely. She was walking the tight-rope. On the one hand, shewished to play the role of moral leader to the world, and. on live other, she wasacting in defiance of the United Nations. He believed thai provided Pakistancould maintain United Nations pressure on India there was hope for favourableresults in time.Mr. Noon said that he had consulted Sir Pierson Dixon in New York whoseadvice was that the dispute could be referred to the General Assembly underArticle 11 (2) of the Charter while still leaving the Security Council seized of theproblem.TOP SECRET53456 i7
Mr. Macmillan said that this was also his understanding. He thought it mightbe important to use the pressure of public opinion with care since it would not bedesirable for the pressure to build up to such a strength as to precipitate trouble.Me asked Mr. Noon what in his view was the purpose behind the release ofSheikh Abdullah.Mr. Noon thought that again this might be the result of the pressure of publicopinion. It was also possible that Mr. Nehru, knowing that Sheikh Abdullahwas formerly in favour of an independent Kashmir, hoped that he would start a movement for independence while Dr. Graham was in the sub-continent. Butlie must have been disappointed to find that Sheikh Abdullah had come out infavour of allowing the people to decide. He thought that Sheikh Abdul!?h wouldonce again establish a large following in Kashmir and that his influence wouldbe very great when the next elections were held. This would not however be for four years, and it was always possible that force would be used to suppress free elections.Mr. Macmillan then enquired about the size of the military forces on bothsides of the Cease-Fire Line and asked whether the Pakistan Government had considered withdrawing a part of their forces (e.g., one battalion) as a demonstration of their readiness to prepare the way for a settlement. He thoughtthai if such a withdrawal could be arranged with appropriate publicity, andabsolutely unconditionally, during Dr. Grahaufs visit, it might have a usefulimpact.Mr. Noon said that he had already talked to General Ayub about such a moveand be thought that Pakistan might well do as Mr. Macmillan suggested. IfPakistan continued to get United Kingdom guidance and support in the united nations, that was as much as they would ask for. He did not think that Indiaintended to reach a settlement. They were getting so strong militarily that theywould defy world opinion on this issue.Mr. Macmillan said that, as Mr. Baig had pointed out, the Indians were in amoral dilemma. He though they were in a diilicult position. He enquired whetherthe population was changing in Kashmir.Mr. Noon said that East and South of the Chenab the Indians had filledJammu with non-Muslims. They were now trying to settle non-Muslims in theValley. They had recently introduced 5,000 of these people, and Mr. KrishnaMenon had claimed that they were only refugees: but this was not true.Mr. Macmillan then asked whether the Pakistan Government thought therewas any chance of reaching an acceptable settlement on Kashmir in direct talks with India. He understood that there was a chance of reaching a solution at onetime when Sardar Patel was alive.Mr. Noon said that there was no chance at the present time of reaching asettlement in direct talks. It was true that Patel had once offered to give Kashmirto Pakistan provided that Pakistan agreed that Hyderabad should go to India.He regretted very much that at the time he had advised his Government againstmaking the accession of Kashmir to Pakistan conditional on Hyderabad&apos;saccession to India.  He now felt sure that the offer should have been accepted.Mr. Macmillan then asked whether there was any partition of the State whichwould provide a reasonable solution.Mr. Noon said he thought there was and that this might be the best way to achieve a solution acceptable to both sides. If separate plebiscites were held inthe main area such as Jammu, the Vale, Buddhist Ladakh, Gilgit and AzadKashmir, a partition could then be arranged in accordance with the wishesexpressed by the majority in each area. He did not know which way the Buddhistsin Ladakh would vote but the wishes of the population in the rest of Kashmirwere reasonably clear. Indeed he thought that the most suitable arrangement would be to divide Kashmir on the principle which had governed the partition ofthe sub-continent, namely areas with Muslim majorities going to Pakistan andareas with Hindu and Sikh majorities going to India. There was much to be saidhowever for making the Chenab the boundary. This would provide Pakistanwith a defensible frontier with China. It would keep India and China apart and pakistan could guarantee to prevent any Chinese force from entering thesub-continent through the western invasion route.   Pakistan would also want
a small area on the south-eastern bank of the Chenab to the border of the Riasidistrict. This would enable her to build a dam at Dhiangharh which was the onlysuitable site for water storage on the Chenab.Mr. Macmillan expressed the belief that ultimately the only settlement inKashmir would be, as Mr. Noon had suggested, by an old-fashioned deal of thekind customary in the 19th century.Mr. Noon said that for obvious reasons Pakistan could not herself suggestthis, but they had spoken very frankly in favour of such a solution during theirtalks with Mr. Jarring. He did not believe that Indian policy on Kashmir wasperson:&apos;! to Nehru: he thought it was now much more widely based than that.But he believed that there was a growing feeling in the Indian Parliament that asettlement was necessary. In conclusion, he said that all that Pakistan requestedwas that the United Kingdom Government should continue their support forPakistani case in the United Nations, and that the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Delhi should continue to search for an acceptable form of settlement.2. Indus Waters DisputeMr. Miieenudclin explained the Pakistan case. Pakistan had offered to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice ad inilio; India bad refused. TheInternational Bank had also lent their good offices to negotiate a settlement. Theyhad formulated proposals in 1954 based on the principle that India should have theuse of the three eastern rivers and Pakistan the use of the three western rivers.Replacement water should be brought from the western fixers to enable Pakistanto make up for the water taken by India from the eastern rivers. The link canalsto carry this replacement water would be constructed at India&quot;s expense. TheBank suggested that certain uses could be met on the Pakistan side from the flow of the western rivers.2. Pakistan had convinced the Bank that the western rivers could not in factprovide sufficient replacement water and meet the uses specified by the Bank.The Bank had then produced its 1956 aide-memoire which took account of this.Pakistan had then accepted, the Bank&apos;s proposals as modified by the 1956 aide-memoire, but India had not.3. Pakistan had then offered to submit the dispute to arbitration on the basisof the Bank&apos;s proposals as modified by the 1956 aide-memoire. India had agreedto submit to arbitration only certain specified aspects, the choice of which and thebasis of which must first be agreed by the two parties. Pakistan considered thatthis did not in fact constitute an agreement on the issues to be submitted.4.   India must be persuaded to accept the Bank&apos;s aide-memoire of 1956.5. Pakistan had a special problem. At present approximately 100,000 acres of land were being lost to cultivation in West Pakistan each year through salination.The only cure was to increase the supply of water in order to wash the salts downinto the sub-soil. It was therefore of great importance to Pakistan to build as muchstorage as possible so a? to provide this increased water supply. The Bank had recognised this and had provided storage capacity for this purpose in the scheme as modified by their 1956 aide-memoire. The minimum use should be made of storage for replacement purposes.6.   India should be persuaded to accept either:  id) reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice, or(b) reference of the Bank&apos;s proposals as they now stood to arbitration, wheredifferences between the two parlies stood in the way of a settlement.7. India must withdraw her threat to cut off the supplies of water in 1962,irrespective of whether an agreement had been reached with Pakistan. india should pay the cost of providing replacement water before depriving Pakistan ofwater from the three eastern rivers.8. India must be persuaded to pay for the cost of maintaining the link canalswhich Pakistan had already built and which had lor some time been used to providereplacement water to enable India to draw off increased supplies from the easternrivers.   Pakistan was paying her due share of the cost of operating the headworksTOP SECRET53456 f 2
H2uon the Indian side of the border and the same principles should apply in the caseof the cost of operating the link canals. India must not fix 1962 as the target forcutting off the supply of water to Pakistan. The water must only be taken by india as replacement water is made available.9. India should agree to inspection and supervision of the working of theirrigation canals and headworks on both sides of the border. Without this the pakistan Government would not be able to satisfy themselves that shortages are due to reasons beyond the Indian Governments control.10. If India were to take all the water in the three eastern rivers it has been estimated by Pakistan that the cost of providing replacement water would be1,250 million dollars. The BamVs less comprehensive plan as shown to Pakistaninformally would cost about 900 million dollars. The Bank have made it clear thatin their view there is no prospect of finding money to finance either of these schemes.They have therefore suggested informally that India should continue to supplyPakistan with water from the three eastern rivers during the winter season.Replacement water would then need to be provided only in the summer seasonwhen the rivers are full. T his would cut down the cost by 50 per cent.; but india had rejected this.11. Pakistan would agree to any arrangement which would safeguard hereconomy. All the irrigation schemes on the Pakistan side had been examined and approved by impartial observers. He did not believe that the Indian scheme toirrigate areas of Rajasthan had ever been examined and approved in this way.Rajasthan was a desert and the cost of taking water to it would be far too high tomake agriculture there economical. Before India spent money by constructingcanals into Rajasthan, she should set aside money to pay for the cost of the worksnecessary to provide replacement water.12. Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government had beenfollowing the Bank negotiations with the greatest interest. He knew from the talkswhich he had had last summer with Pakistan and Indian Ministers, including mr.. Noon what an important and anxious problem this was for Pakistan. He wasdisappointed that more progress towards its solution had not been made. He was grateful for the memoranda which the Pakistan Government had give him. and hewould arrange for these to be studied urgently by the experts in London. The HighCommissioner would then get in touch with &quot;the Pakistan Prime Minister. he understood that Mr. Hill of the World Bank was on his way out to the sub-continenttocontinue his negotiations. He asked whether the Pakistan Government knewwhatproposals Mr. Iliff was bringing.13. Mr. Mueenuddin explained that the division of water between India and pakistan had been governed by an ad hoc agreement which ended on 31st March,1957. The main negotiations ended on 3 1st December, 1957. Mr. Iliffs negotiationsfor an extension on the main agreement were based on the Bank&apos;s aide-memoire.He believed that Mr. IlifT was going to try to get the negotiations going again.14. Mr. Macmillan said that Mr. Iliffs proposals as he understood them,seemed similar to what Pakistan had in mind.15. Mr. Mueenuddin agreed. It was not practicable to replace all the waterreaching Pakistan from the three eastern rivers in the winter season. There mightbe other possible solutions. The Lilienthal one was for a survey of the existinguses and for a study then of some joint user programme. He doubted whether there was much chance of getting Indian agreement. He therefore believed that a reference either to the International Court of Justice or to arbitration was the propersolution, but he did not consider that India would agree. Pakistan had asked theBank to give an authoritative interpretation of their proposals and then to putforward a plan based on that interpretation. The Bank feared that this would produce a scheme which would be too costly for India to accept but Pakistanconsidered it unfair that the Bank should decline to bring the issue to a head inthis way.16. Mr. Macmillan said he feared there might be a danger of the Bank losinginterest if the two Governments did not co-operate in finding a solution. The Bankdid not have unlimited money.17. Mr. Mueenuddin said the Bank was not investing its money in asolution : it was merely offering its good offices. They might advance some money
to help the two sides 10 finance the works which were their responsibility. He didnot think they would go further than this. It was not therefore a question of theBank using its available funds for other purposes.18. Mr. Macmillun said that the truth seemed to be that the solution whichhad been under discussion for some years with the Bank would be impossiblyexpensive and neither India nor Pakistan nor the United Kingdom, nor indeedanyone else, could provide the money for it. Therefore some other more practical and less expensive solution must be sought.19. Mr. Mueenuddin said that if it were agreed that India should supplyPakistani requirements of winter water from the^three eastern rivers this wouldmean supplying only about 12 per cent, of the total winter flow available to her inthese rivers.20. Mr. Noon said that he would prefer to be independent of India becausethey might decide on some future occasion again to cut off the water.21. Mr. Macmillan said the possibility seemed to be that Mr. Iliff would beable to get the period of the negotiations extended and that he might find some agreement. It looked as though the Pakistan proposal was the only practicalone and this should appeal to the Bank. He wondered whether the pakistan government were thinking of undertaking any further &quot;defensive &quot; works.22. Mr. Mueenuddin said this was not possible. The Mangla Dam was goingto take all Pakistani resources. The link canals had not yet been completedthrough lack of machinery. They ran across the natural drainage of the Punjaband every year floods caused great damage to them. Pakistan had asked the UnitedStates I.C.A. for machinery, but the latter had not been prepared to supply anything which was concerned with the Canal Waters dispute.23. Mr. Macmillan said that if once agreement could be reached on the pakistan Governments proposals for the supply of winter water, a generalagreement should be much easier to obtain.24. Mr. Noon agreed that this was so and that a solution would then befinancially possible.25. Mr. Macmillan then asked whether India had rejected the Bank&apos;sproposals for the continued supply by India of winter water. What was Mr. Iliffsattitude to them?26. Mr. Mueenuddin said Mr. Iliff had been noticeably less enthusiastic since he had discussed them with the Government of India during his last visit to Delhi.27. If agreement were reached there would still be a time lag before thenecessary storage and link canals could be completed. It would therefore still benecessary for India to continue to supply for some time winter water from thethree eastern rivers. He feared however that once irrigation canals had been builtinto Rajasthan great political pressure would be brought to bear on the Governmentof India to divert water into them. This would mean cutting off water fromPakistan.3. GwadurMalik Firoz Khan Noon referred to the information his Government hadreceived from their legal advisers. This was that sovereignty had not been handedover by the Khan of Kalat and that the present Sultan could not therefore claim tohave inherited sovereignty over Gwadur.He then indicated on a map the boundary line of the area over which, in theview of the Pakistan Government, certain rights had been transferred by the Khanof Kalat to Muscat. He explained that the Pakistan Government were consideringthe positioning of a cordon across the narrow isthmus in order to prevent smugglingfrom Gwadur into Baluchistan.He then explained that in 1949 Mr. Ikramuilah, the present Pakistan HighCommissioner in London, had virtually negotiated a settlement with the Sultanfor the transfer of Gwadur on payment of Rs.ll millions. Unfortunately the pakistan Government had not followed this up.Mr. Macmillan said that this was a very difficult problem. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had every sympathy with Pakistan. They would do their best to persuade the Sultan to agree to the sale of Gwadur. Such an agreement would bethe best form of settlement.  Her Majesty&apos;s Governments legal advisers considered
that the Sultan had a valid claim to sovereignty over an area greater than thatindicated by Mr. Noon. He supposed that Pakistan could refer this issue to theInternational Court of Justice, but he doubted whether that would be wise. Theresult of such a reference could never be clearly foreseen. The Sultan was anindependent ruler. He was proud and somewhat stubborn. But Her majesty&apos;s government would put every pressure on him to sell Gwadur to Pakistan. Theyhad helped him when he was faced with the Oman rising and he owed Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment a debt of gratitude. People did not always pay such debts but her majesty&apos;s Government had some means of applying pressure. They had recentlysent out Mr. Julian Amery. the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the War Office,to discuss with the Sultan&apos;whether better arrangements could not be made for thedefence of Muscat. The Sultan*s forces had proved ineffective and his administration incapable of dealing with the situation created by the recentuprising. Her Majesty\s Government considered that, if the Sultan was to be in aposition to deal with any future situation of the same kind he must reorganise his forces. This would mean getting British officers and equipment. Mr. Amery hadbeen sent to Muscat to persuade the Sultan of the necessity of such measures. a message had come from him just after Mr. Macmillan left London which was not unsatisfactory on the general question but which reported that the Sultan had declined to discuss Gwadur. The Sultan had said that he would go to London inMay and would be prepared then to talk about Gwadur. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would do their best to see that the Sultan kept to this time-table and,when he came to London, they would bring all the pressure they could bear on himover Gwadur. He thought it would be better not to try to get any filial answer inthe meantime, flic Sultan would be coming for a general settlement. This mightbe the most opportune time to persuade him to part with Gwadur.Malik Firoz Khan Noon said that Pakistan had only one request namely thatthe United Kingdom Government should not sign any agreement with the Sultanunless he agreed to hand o\er Gwadur. As things stood now Pakistan could use force against Gwadur though they would not do so without the knowledge and consent of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. But, once a defence treaty had been signedbetween the United Kingdom Government and the Sultan. Pakistan would not beable to use force against Gwadur. Mr. Noon went on to say that tribal leaders likethe Sultan were in his experience most cunning. He was doubtful whether her majesty*s Government would in fact succeed in persuading the Sultan to give upGwadur. He thought the best tactics would be to make a show of force. He had suggested this to Mr. Selwyn Lloyd on several occasions, but Mr. LloycLs advicehad always been to wait.Mr. Macmillan said that his own view also was that Pakistan should wait. Ifthey moved forces into the Gwadur area the Sultan or one of his friends might welltake the issue to the Security Council.Malik Firoz Khan Noon said that he would be prepared for this. In that eventhe would take the issue to the International Court of Justice.Mr. Macmillan then said that he understood that the view of our own legal advisers would be against the Pakistan case. He thought that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were in a strong bargaining position. It was a case of doubleblackmail. The Sultan knew that he might have to appeal to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment again for help if there was another uprising. On the other hand he knew that it would he difficult for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to abandon himbecause of the repercussions elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Macmillan was^quite clear, when the Sultan came to London, he should be told that no agreement would be signed with him for the strengthening and reorganisation of his forcesunless he was prepared to reach a reasonable scttfement over Gwadur. If the Sultanrefused he would have to be told that Her Majesty&apos;s Government might have to reconsider their policy towards him. If he was going to be unhelpful over Gwadur,Her Majesty*s Government might not he prepared to expose themselves again tothe embarrassments they were put into last summer. Of course there was still theconsideration that the Sultan knew that the other Sheiks in the Persian Gulf were&apos;looking to see what support he received from Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and theirown relations with Her Majesty&apos;s Government might be influenced by theconclusions which they drew.Malik Firoz Khan Noon said that, if the Sultan refused to settle in May, her majesty&apos;s Government should agree that they would then give the pakistan government permission to occupy Gwadur up to the line across the isthmus.
Mr. Macmillan said that he certainly could not do that.  The position would have to be reconsidered after the Sultan&apos;s visit.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government mightbe able to press him further in the meantime.  He suggested that, when the PakistanPrime Minister saw Mr. Selwyn Lloyd at Ankara, they might together draw up a: heads of agreement which could then be put to the Sultan.Malik Firoz Khan Noon then said that it would be enough for him to have the assurance that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would not sign any fresh agreement withI the Sultan without his undertaking to make a satisfactory settlement over Gwadur.!4. Supply of Arms from the United Kingdom to India- Mr. Noon opened by saying that General Truman, the head of the UnitedStates Military Aid Group in Pakistan, had recently told General Ayub that theUnited States might stop their aid in 1959. That was just the time when UnitedKingdom supplies of military equipment to India would have put India in a very strong position. It was also the time when dangerous pressures might developagainst Pakistan on the Canal Waters issue. The situation would have been easierif the United Kingdom Government had obtained assurances from India that theywould not use this equipment against Pakistan, and if the United Kingdom had given assurances to Pakistan similar to those given by the United States that theUnited Kingdom would come to Pakistan*s assistance if she were attacked.Mr. Macmillan said that the arms race between India and Pakistan was aterrible thing.   He hoped that it had now reached saturation point, because he; believed neither side could afford to buy more.Mr. Noon then referred to a time some years ago when India had been deterred from attacking Pakistan because the Indians knew that the Pakistan Air force had a number of Halifax bombers with which Pakistan could attack India. TheUnited States had not given Pakistan any bombers. Pakistan could not buy them.He therefore urged that the United Kingdom should lend Pakistan bombers whichcould be returned in case they were needed. He then asked whether the UnitedKingdom Government had in fact required India to give any assurance that she would not use the arms she had acquired from Britain against Pakistan.I Mr. Macmillan thought that was understood, but there was no formal agreement. There was an essential difference between our position and that ofthe United States, in that we had sold military equipment to India, whereas theUnited States, in supplying equipment to Pakistan, had given it.i    Mr. Noon then asked that the United Kingdom Government should letPakistan have 10 bombers under lend-lease arrangements.  Mr. Macmillan said thathe would think about it.  He would also like Mr. Noon to consider it further.   Hethought there was a danger that if Her Majesty&apos;s Government met the Pakistanrequest, India would then only buy more military aircraft herself.   This wouldaggravate the arms race.   Both India and Pakistan, like all other commonwealth countries, were free to purchase arms from the United Kingdom Industry if they so wished.   But the British Government did not feel that they could or shouldmake use of their country&apos;s position as a supplier of such equipment in order toregulate the respective military strength of India and Pakistan.   He was afraid that Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy might have caused disappointment to both countries.   He wondered whether it might have been better for them to declineho supply such equipment to either of them, but he thought that a point had beenreached at which neither India nor Pakistan could afford to buy more.I    Mr. Noon said that India&apos;s intentions were evil.   He did not believe that&quot;they would want to buy military equipment if they did not mean to attack Pakistan.Pakistan was afraid of the Indian threat. When he was in New York he had spokenabout this to Mr. Dulles.  The American Secretary of State had then given him an assurance that if Pakistan were attacked America would come to her assistance.He agreed that this assurance was based on the Charter of the United Nations.   Ithad had a powerful effect on public opinion in Pakistan, and it would have a[wonderful effect if the United Kingdom could give some similar assurance.   HeKwould have thought that as the leading member of the Commonwealth, the United^Kingdom should not do less than the United States had done.RlThe following is the text of the statement issued by Malik Firoz Khan Noon onbjfc,, November 23, 1957, after his conversation with Mr. Dulles:  &quot; I had a full and satisfactory discussion with Secretary of State DullesHfe with respect to various matters of mutual concern.   Among other things I
nipraised with Mr. Dulles the question of assistance which Pakistan could expectfrom the United States in the event it was the subject of armed aggression.Mr. Dulles referred to the relations of the United States to Pakistan underSEATO, the Joint Resolution on the Middle East and the association of theUnited States pursuant thereto with the Baghdad Pact countries, and theobligations of members of the United Nations. He left me in no doubt thatthe United States would promptly and effectively come to the assistance of pakistan if it were subjected to armed aggression, which, however, the UnitedStates did not anticipate.&quot;]Mr. Baig explained that the special significance of the assurances which mr. Dulles had given was that on this occasion he did not limit them to the promise of assistance in the event of attack from a Communist country.Mr. Macmillan said that he wished to consider the matter further in consultationwith his colleagues.  He would like to study Mr. Dulles&apos; declaration.Mr. Noon explained that the United States were giving economic aid to India.This amounted to much the same as military aid since it enabled India to spendher own money on buying military equipment. The Americans had given a certainamount of equipment to bring one division of the Pakistan Army up to strength.They had not so far uiven any bombers, but he did not think these were withheld from Pakistan as a matter of principle (namely that the United States should not give offensive weapons). The United States Government had recently said thatthey would provide Pakistan with bombers in 1960. He must leave it toMr. Macmillan, but he hoped that Pakistan might get the same support from theUnited Kingdom as they received from the United States.Mr. Macmillan said that his impression was that the United States had a very big hold over India. The Government of India realised that their economic development programme was of the highest importance. So far they had financedit largely out of the sterling balances. These balances were the price thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government had paid for defending India during the war. Theycould not be run down much further without endangering the Indian currency.India would therefore have to rely increasingly on the United States as the oneremaining source of capital on a large scale.Mr. Noon said that he would not expect. Britain, as leader of theCommonwealth, to give any one-sided guarantees. He thought that if Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would say that they would come to the aid of either of the twocountries if it was attacked, that would be well received. He asked Mr. Macmillanto bear in mind that if the United Kingdom sold Canberras to India, the UnitedKingdom ought also to let Pakistan have 10 Canberras for use by the P.A.F.5. Exports of ClothMr. Noon said that the Pakistan Government were worried on this score. In1956 Pakistan had exported 9 million yards to the United Kingdom. During thefirst ten months of 1957 exports had fallen to 4-1 million yards. His impression wasthat British importers were holding back.Moreover, the United Kingdom&apos;s purchases of raw cotton from Pakistan were much less than they had been. Britain was now taking only 10 per cent, ofPakistani exports of cotton to the United Kingdom in 1952-53. The americans were lending money to European countries with which to buy United States cotton,and it was in large part this which had led to the decline in the sale of Pakistanicotton. In view of all this the question of fixing a ceiling for the imports ofPakistani cotton cloth into the United Kingdom should not arise at this stage..Mr. Aziz Ahmed said that a delegation from the Lancashire industry had metPakistani representatives in Karachi in May 1957. Lord Rochdale had now suggested another meeting in London, but the Pakistani authorities wondered ifthis was the right way of deciding the issue. A private delegation of the Pakistanindustry would have no authority to negotiate a restriction of exports whenPakistani declared policy was to expand exports by every means possible. it seemed to him therefore that this subject could perhaps best be discussed on aGovernment to Government basis.Mr. Macmillan said the idea of the meeting was that the three industries(Pakistani, Indian and British) should together fix a ceiling beyond which imports would not go. He did not think it should be difficult to fix a ceiling, which in all probability would be above last year&apos;s.   If an agreement on these lines could be
ached between the industries, then the United Kingdom Government wouldpolice &quot; it.   The difficulty was of course the position of Hong Kong.   But if theong Kong industry did not agree to accept the ceiling proposed, then anyangements reached between the other three industries would be subject to reviewd all bets would be off.   Similarly, if either India or Pakistan felt they could noteep to arrangements reached a fresh agreement would have to be negotiated.Mr. Macmillan went on to say that he had discussed the whole matter in DelhiIid that the Indian Government had agreed to use their good offices to persuadeidian industry to resume the negotiations. It would be a pity if the Pakistanidustry did not also participate. When the three industries had reached agreement,e plan was that the Hong Kong industry would then be asked to agree also.Mr. Noon said that if individual ceilings were to be fixed with each countryparately, then the chance of competition was removed. The Pakistandustrialists had claimed that they could beat India. They would like a jointiling to be fixed.He wished to refer again to the disparity between Pakistani purchases frome United Kingdom and vice versa. Mr. Aziz Ahmed said that in 1956 the deficitPakistani balance of payments with the United Kingdom was Rs.488 millions,the first ten months of 1957 it was Rs.570 millions. He also gave comparativetngiires for the balance of visible trade. He said it would seem as though United[Kingdom exports to Pakistan in 1957 were going up, whereas Pakistani exportsito United Kingdom would probably not even reach the 1956 mark. Cotton was(Pakistani second largest earner of foreign exchange. The disappearance of thesUnited Kingdom&apos;s interest in cotton in the context of the balance of payments^position vis-a-vis the United Kingdom was therefore a matter of great concern to[Pakistan.Mr. Macmillan said that he wondered whether the balance of trade with^individual countries was the right way of looking at it. Most countries do not trybalance trade with each country separately. That would be barter, not trade.:0n cotton he would like to say this. Pakistani cotton was very much liked in theUnited Kingdom. It was a great pity that we could not buy more. He felt that&apos;it might well help if the Pakistan textiles industry felt able to take part in theproposed tri-lateral talks with Indian and British industries on cotton textiles.Mr. Noon and Mr. Qizilbash agreed and said that they would do their best toArrange for the Pakistan industry to be represented.Mr. Aziz Ahmed said that it had never been suggested that Pakistan shouldiboycott the tri-lateral talks, but rather that they should be held on a Government;to Government basis. However, in view of what had passed, Pakistan would not&apos;now wish to press this point.*Mr. Macmillan said that it was much to be hoped that we could get some agreedceiling for cotton textile imports to cover the next three to four years. If this couldbe achieved, it would provide a chance to reorganise th? Lancashire industrywithout Government interference. Such interference would be bad in itself and cause a great deal of difficulty and trouble. Since the Indians for their part would;be participating in the proposed industry talks he greatly hoped that Pakistan alsoswould feel able to take part.I CEYLONRecord of a Conversation between the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and ceylon in Colombo on 16th January, 1958The Prime Minister called on Mr. Bandaranaike at 5-30 p.m. on 16th january and had a conversation with him lasting for rather more than an hour.   The Primef* In agreeing this record of the discussion with the Senior Trade Commissioner, Mr. AzizAhmed pointed out that although not mentioned during the discussion, the Pakistan government must fully reserve their position.   The Pakistan Governments agreement to the Pakistan industry; taking part in the discussions could carry no commitment that the Government would be able to^accept any agreement come to by the Pakistan industry.   He hoped this was fully understood andfaccepted by the United Kingdom Government.TOP SECRET53456 G
U2&amp; minister  was  accompanied  by  Sir  Norman  Brook: Mr.   Bandaranaike;Mr. de Soyza.The following is a summary of the main points raised in this conversation, t1. Soviet UnionMr. Bandaranaike expressed great interest in the terms of our response * mr . Bulganin&apos;s letters. He said that he &quot; had reason to believe &quot; that the SovieAmbassador in Colombo had heard from his Government that they were anxious tomake progress towards a settlement of some outstanding issues. Mr. Bandaranaikesaid that he himself believed that the climate was now more favourable for dicussionswith the Soviets than it had been for some time past. The Soviet leaders would prefer a meeting of Heads of Governments: they believed that better progress was more likely to be made at this level. He hoped therefore that the Western powers would not reject this latest approach.The Prime Minister said that much turned on the purpose and intentions ofthe Soviet Government. One could not at this stage be sure whether it was their object to make propaganda or whether they genuinely wished to make some progress towards an understanding which would reduce the crippling burden of competitivearmaments. One test of their intentions would be their reactions to proposals on procedure. If they were interested only in propaganda, they would probablycontinue to press for a large meeting: if they really wanted to make progress towards a settlement, they would themselves see the advantages of a smaller gathering. the geneva meetings had shown that little practical progress could be made without adequate preparation. If, therefore, a meeting of Heads of Governments was tobe held, it was essential that adequate preliminary preparations for it should be made but these need not necessarily take a long time.On this point Mr. Bandaranaike repeated his view that the Soviet leaders were now anxious to make some progress towards a settlement and that it wouldbe expedient for us to work for a fairly early meeting of Heads of Governments. he added that he &quot; had reason to believe &quot; that the Soviet leaders had a great respect for the United Kingdom.Mr. Bandaranaike welcomed the reference which the Prime Minister had madeto the possibility of a pact of non-aggression. This was a proposal which Ceylon:would strongly support.The Prime Minister explained the nature of the objection which the UnitedStates had initially raised to this suggestion, viz., that a limited pact of non-aggressionwould add nothing to the provisions of the United Nations Charter and might bethought to weaken their authority. On the other hand, it was possible that a limitedpact of this kind might have value merely because it was not universal. Moreover,Germany could subscribe to such a pact and, not being a member of the united nations, she was not bound by the obligations of its Charter. The idea was there-fore one which might be worth pursuing. By way of illustration, the Prime Ministeradded that, although India and Pakistan were both members of the United Nations,a separate pact of non-aggression between them would certainly have the effect ofincreasing confidence throughout the Sub-Continent.In the course of this part of the conversation, the Prime Minister mentioned that what the Russians feared most was a resurgence of Germany&apos;s military power-and they might therefore be brought to recognise that a neutral Germany could bevery dangerous even to them. Mr. Bandaranaike agreed that it would suit the:Russians better that Germany should continue to be divided. The Prime Minister.said that it seemed likely that on this account the Russians would in the last resort be&apos; unwilling to conclude an agreement for the withdrawal of all foreign troops froEast and West Germany.2. China in the course of a short discussion on China, Mr. Bandaranaike said that it neenot be assumed that Chinese Communism would follow the pattern of RussianCommunism. They were a wholly different people and might well go their own way. It was unfortunate that they should at present be ostracised by the West;and he knew, from his private conversations with Chou En-lai, that this was bitterlyresented.   On the other hand, Chou En-lai was less concerned about the question of
Chinese representation in the United Nations.   He would certainly not be preparedto accept a position in which the Chinese Communist Government were representedt the United Nations at the price of accepting the Nationalist Government as^presenting Formosa.   Sooner than that he would prefer to remain out of the&quot;nited Nations for the time being.3. IndonesiaMr. Bandaranaike said that he was concerned about the situation in Indonesia.He thought that President Soekarno had got himself into trouble by failing to dealfirmly with the extreme elements.   It was significant that the attempt on his life *had been made by Muslim extremists.   It was likely &quot;that the more moderate(elements in Indonesia had advised Soekarno to go away for a time, and that this wastie real reason for his present journey. He would shortly be paying a brief visit to Ceylon.The Prime Minister said that he thought that Mr. Nehru had spoken prettystrongly to Soekarno while he was in Delhi. He said that he would be interested;to have Mr. Bandaranaike&apos;s impressions of him and invited him to send him a^personal letter after Soekarno&apos;s visit.4. Economic development the Prime Minister, leading in from what had been said about Indonesia, saidthat he was concerned about the situation from a wider point of view.   He was anxious about the future of economic development in Asia generally.   All Asian^countries were in urgent need of oversea capital for development purposes.   ButI there was in fact a world shortage of capital.   The demand for investment was[outrunning supply, because there was among the peoples of the world a greaterI desire to consume wealth in the present rather than accumulate it for the purpose of investment which would increase living standards in the future.   In these circum-I stances it was inevitable that oversea investors should put their money in thoseI countries where their capital would be most secure and most likely to earn aI reasonable rate of interest.   If President Soekarno was unwise enough to dealI roughly with foreign capital investors in Indonesia, he could hardly expect to attract[any fresh capital for further development.   The Government of India had realisedI this risk and were refraining from unreasonable action which would drive foreign  investors to look elsewhere.  British business in India had actually increased since i Independence; and the Government of India were showing that they were anxious for this state of affairs to continue.   Other countries in Asia would do well to keep-this important point in mind.I[5. Ceylon1(a) FloodsThe Prime Minister expressed his sympathy for the suffering and loss and damage caused by the recent floods in Ceylon.In reply to questions, Mr. Bandaranaike said that a precise assessment had\ already been made of the extent of the damage, and it was even worse than had at;. first been feared. Extensive repairs would be needed to railways, roads, bridges,&quot;water-storage tanks and telecommunications. In addition it would be necessary toIre-house and rehabilitate between 250,000 and 300,000 people who had lost their&quot;homes. It would also be necessary to find them employment in the meantime. Iti was hoped that many of them could be employed on the necessary work of^reconstruction. If further money could be raised to advance this work, it might beH completed in 3-5 years.The Prime Minister said that the United Kingdom Government had already offered to provide medical supplies and other requirements needed to relieveimmediate hardship.   Aid of this kind, totalling  10,000 in value, had been madeavailable or was on the way.   He would be willing to provide further aid of this kind,j [.to the value of another  10,000; and our High Commissioner could ascertain, in^consultation with officials of the Ceylon Government, in what form this further&quot;fassistance could best be given.TOP SECRET53456 G 2
Mr. Bandaranaike expressed gratitude for this further offer.   He was, however,very concerned about the long-term task of reconstruction.   Would it be possiblefor the United Kingdom Government to write off the sums in respect of the naval base at Trincomalee?   Alternatively, could they give facilities for a loan to be raisechon the London market?The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the first thing must be to assess moreSprecisely the exact extent and nature of the damage and to formulate .1 detailed!programme of reconstruction. The United Kingdom Government would be glad&apos;:&apos;to help with this, by providing any technical advice or assistance which Ceylon might [require for this purpose. The suggestions which Mr. Bandaranaike had made aboutthe financing of this work could best be left over for consideration when the scope iand timing of the reconstruction programme was more precisely known.The Prime Minister, in conclusion, undertook to send Mr. Bandaranaike a written statement of the offers which he had made in the course of this part of the conversation.(b) strikes in reply to questions, Mr. Bandaranaike said that labour conditions in the port of Colombo had now been stabilised. Work on ships had been resumed. steps had also been taken to reduce the risk of a repetition of this labour trouble. Oneof the difficulties had been the multiplication of trade unions among the dockworkers: he hoped that this was now on the way to being rationalised. Anothercause of the difficulty was the fact that an undue proportion of Ceylon&apos;s seabornetrade was concentrated on the port of Colombo. This position might be eased infuture by further development and use of the port at Galle.(c) Independence Day jjMr. Bandaranaike said that it was important, from the point of view of the solidarity of the Commonwealth, that the United Kingdom should be represented by a Minister at the forthcoming celebration of the tenth anniversary of Ceylon&apos;independence. He had originally said that this would be a Commonwealthoccasion: this decision had been sharply criticised by Left-wing elements in Ceylon,who were anxious that foreign U.e., Russian and Chinese) representatives shouldalso be invited: and, in view of this, he would be in an embarrassing position if inthe event few Commonwealth countries were adequately represented. In thesecircumstances he urged very strongly that a United Kingdom Minister should come out to Ceylon for this purpose.The Prime Minister undertook to give favourable consideration to this request.6. KashmirMr. Bandaranaike asked what impression the Prime Minister had formed,during his visits to India and Pakistan, of the prospects for a settlement of the disputes about Kashmir and the Indus Waters.The Prime Minister said that these were difficult issues. He had not thoughtit wise to offer any advice to either Government on them. He feared that feeling between the two countries was still running high and that there was little prospect ofan early settlement of either problem.In his judgment the question of the Indus Waters was the more crucial and urgent of the two. For, if India were ieft in a position in which she could deny waterto Pakistan, she would be able to strangle Pakistani economy and would have the&apos; country at her mercy. Against this, however, it was true that, if a sensible settlementof the Kashmir issue could be reached, Pakistan could be provided with all the watershe needed for about a third of the cost of the scheme now under contemplation.Mr. Bandaranaike said that these disputes were distorting the economy of both countries. Both were spending far more money on arms than they could afford. AndIndia was pouring money into Kashmir in order to win support. On the other side,Pakistan was inclined to magnify these disputes in order to distract public attention from her own political instability. He himself believed that the best solution wouldbe to partition Kashmir on the basis of the status quo, viz., along the lines of existingmilitary occupation. He feared, however, that this solution would not at present be acceptable to either party.
SINGAPOREecord of the Final Session of the Annual Conference of the Commissioner-General, South-East Asia, held at Eden Hall, Singapore, on 19th January, 1958On 19th January the Prime Minister attended the final session of the annualonference of the Commissioner-General, South-East Asia.   This lasted from30 a.m. to 11 - 40 a.m.After a few introductory remarks by the Commissioner-General, the PrimeMinister spoke for a quarter-of-an-hour, in general terms, on the oversea policyof the United Kingdom Government. The Commissioner-General had told him .previously that there was a general feeling among those attending the conference that the Government were not following a clear and consistent line of policy andthat the task of their representatives overseas was made more difficult by uncertainty about the Governments long-term aims and objectives. The Prime Ministersopening remarks were therefore addressed to this point and he spoke on thefollowing theme..Britain&apos;s material strength military, financial and commercial had shrunk&apos;as a result of the effort which we had put forth in two world wars. Weacknowledged the material supremacy of the United States and the Soviet Union;but, though we could not rival these giants in sheer size and productive capacity,we still chose to remain a great Power. It would have been possible for us to stepback, after the Second World War, into a simpler position: to relax our grip overmany more of our oversea positions: and to consolidate on a much narrowerfront so as to live more easily within our post-war means. We had chosen instead to try to hold on wherever we could and we were now in the position of a greatland-owner who, faced with high taxation and heavy death duties, declined to give up the old house even though he had to close some of the wings and cut down someof the trees. We had, moreover, taken on new obligations. We had decided tobecome a nuclear Power. The cost of this decision, in terms of its demands onour resources, was prodigious; and, when account was taken of the almost unlimitedvariety of nuclear weapons now under development or in prospect, it seemeddoubtful whether we should be able to persist in unlimited competition with theSoviet Union in nuclear development. Nevertheless, the decisions of Mr. Attleeand Sir Winston Churchill, respectively, to produce the A-bomb and the H-bombhad enabled us to continue to speak with the United States on level terms in the formulation of world policy, and it was arguable that they had so far paid a usefuldividend. For the future our burden might be eased if, after the promisedamendment of the McMahon Act, we could come to a rational agreement with the americans for the sharing of information and &quot; know how &quot; and a co-ordinatedprogramme of weapons production.All this had meant that Governments in the United Kingdom had been obliged,since the end of the war, to adapt their oversea policies to changing circumstances.They had not been masters of the situation. They had not therefore been able to formulate a clear and consistent long-term policy. They had necessarily to livehand-to-mouth and to improvise. This, admittedly, made difficulties for theirrepresentatives overseas. But it had been unavoidable, and to a large extent itwould continue to be unavoidable in the years ahead. The fact was that we were still trying to do more than we could easily do with the resources at our command.Even so, there was no reason why we should be ashamed of our post-warrecord. In India the transfer of power had been made in such a way as to createfriendship where otherwise there might have been enmity and bitterness. during his recent visits to India, Pakistan and Ceylon he had been greatly impressed bythe friendship and strength of common purpose which still bound those countries to the rest of the Commonwealth. Throughout these countries, though we nolonger had authority, we still had great influence. As he had said in a recent speech,the Commonwealth was not breaking up; it was growing up. The commonwealth as a whole still had great influence in the world, and there was no reason why thatinfluence should not increase. And the United Kingdom itself had greatopportunities to influence world affairs through the medium of the Commonwealthassociation. The material strength of the old Commonwealth members, if joinedwith the moral influence of the Asiatic members, meant that a unitedCommonwealth would always have a very powerful voice in world affairs,
UZvThe Prime Minister said that he looked forward to 1958 with much greaterconfidence than he could have felt at the beginning of 1957. Suez had been a tactical defeat. But it might well prove in the end to have been a strategic turningpoint in our relations with the United States. We had, after all, prevented them from embarking on military operations in Indo-China; and they in turn, later, hadcompelled us to discontinue the military operations which we had begun at Suez.After this exchange we both seemed to have come to the conclusion that it wouldbe wiser to concert our national policies in those parts of the world. At Bermudain March 1957 a useful start had been made in repairing the breach in Anglo-American relations. At the Washington meeting in October 1957 much greaterprogress had been made, and Anglo-American co-operation had been put back onthe footing of our old wartime comradeship. For the first time since the end ofthe war the Americans had been willing to recognise that there was a special relationship between our two countries, different from that which either of us had with any third party, and they had taken practical steps to reinstitute the oldpartnership.In conclusion the Prime Minister spoke of the mood of public opinion inEurope as reflected at the last meeting of the North Atlantic Council. It was evident that in the United Kingdom, and in some other countries of Europe, therewas a growing feeling that it was not enough for the Western Powers, in the irrelations with the Soviet Union, to rely solely on the power of the nuclear deterrent. Despite the agitation for the suspension of nuclear tests, there was general recognition that the Western Powers could not afford to forgo nuclear weapons; and it was important that there should be no weakening on this point.For, in spite of their development of ballistic rockets, the Russians were still continuing to expand their bomber force; and, at sea, they were adding to theirsubstantial surface fleet a formidable strength in submarines. It was thereforeevident that, if nuclear weapons were outlawed, the Russians would have an overwhelming superiority in conventional strength. The Western Powers must therefore maintain their capacity for military defence and the strength of theNorth Atlantic Alliance must be preserved. That Alliance served three purposes.First, to keep the Americans in Europe: second, to foster the cohesion of our allies on the continent of Europe and to strengthen their resistance to Communism :and, third, to provide enough of a trip-wire or shield to prevent the Russians from being able to gain their ends by piecemeal penetration. All this must be maintained.But neither the British people nor their European allies would have the will tomaintain this military defence unless they were reassured, from time to time, thatthere was in fact no other means of averting the threat of Soviet encroachment.They must be satisfied that the vast expenditure on modern armaments was reallynecessary. From this point of view the recent Russian propaganda was dangerous and had to be countered. Public opinion in the West must be satisfied that we werelosing no opportunities of reaching an understanding with the Soviet Government.If the attempt were made and it became clear that Russian protestations wereinsincere, the British people and their allies would be ready to continue the sacrifices which our military preparedness involved. But for that purpose it wasnecessary for the Governments of the West to demonstrate that they were notrejecting Russian overtures out of hand but were prepared to discuss if theRussians gave proof of their sincerity practical measures for easing international tension.The Commissioner-General then invited the representatives from selectedcountries to give their appreciation of the main points affecting each. Thefollowing is a brief summary of the main points made in this part of the discussion.The Governor of Singapore (Sir William Goode) said that he was disturbed by an apparent conflict between our Colonial and defence policies. On the onehand we were committed to giving full self-government to Singapore, with all thatthis entailed. On the other, the retention of our present defence facilities in the island was regarded by our military authorities as essential to our strategy in theFar East.The Commander-in-Chief, Far East Land Forces (Lieutenant-General SirFrancis Festing) said that it was indeed vital that we should retain our foothold in singapore. Malaya was important to the defence of Singapore, but its future was doubtful. It must therefore be admitted that in Singapore we were putting all our military eggs in one basket, and some measure of reassurance would be valuable.Possibilities were to create some alternative means of logistic support from
Australia and possibly New Zealand; and to create supplementary bases and otherdefence facilities in Borneo. But this should not be done in such a way as tocreate the impression that we intended to abandon Singapore. Indeed, the creationof an alternative base elsewhere would involve capital expenditure beyondanything which the United Kingdom Government could afford.The United Kingdom High Commissioner in Malaya (Sir Geofroy Tory) gavehis impression of the present political situation and future prospects in Malaya.The existing Government were likely to win the next election, but the SocialistParty was rapidly increasing its political strength and might well, in his judgment,be in a position to win the next election thereafter. It was a plank in thejrprogramme to revoke the defence agreement with the United Kingdom. Thispolitical situation made it imperative for the Tunku to avoid any split in his party and on that account he might be unable to go as far as he himself would wish in support of United Kingdom policy. The fact must therefore be faced thatin five years, or possibly earlier, pressure might develop for the withdrawal of all british forces from Malaya. Nevertheless, if we did anything at this stage to showthat we regarded this as inevitable, the effect would be to precipitate the situationwhich we most wanted to avoid.Lieutenant-General Festing said that he was strongly of that opinion. he attached particular importance to the completion of the Malacca cantonmentwhich would be required to house our troops when they were withdrawn from the jungle.The Prime Minister said that this confronted us with a dilemma. If wehesitated to build this cantonment, we should be helping to drive Malayaprematurely into neutralism. If, on the other hand, we built it we might bewasting our money on accommodation which we should have to leave soon after it was completed.Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d Affaires, Peking (Mr. A. D. Wilson), said that ithad not been a good year for the Chinese Communist Government. They were faced with serious economic difficulties. We were retaining a precarious toe-holdin China through our trade relations. But he was doubtful whether we had securedany additional benefit by re-establishing diplomatic relations with the chinese communist Government. They gave us on that account no greater consideration in matters of trade than they were ready to give to others, e.g.. Western Germany.And, as we were not prepared to support them, e.g., in relation to membership of the United Nations, they tended to regard our attitude as hypocritical andbasically hostile.Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Jakarta (Mr. D. F. MacDermot), said that, sinceindependence, Indonesia had passed through a period of incompetence andmisrule, and with the final expulsion of the Dutch now faced a long period ofeconomic chaos.   The long-term solution was to build up, by training and assistance, a sufficient number of administrators and technicians to enable the indonesians to run their own country efficiently.  This, however, would take manyyears and would have to be done mainly by the Americans.  In the short-term weshould be ready to take over unobtrusively the commercial role which the Dutchhad previously played.  We should also do our utmost to keep the Federation in being; for an independent Java would rapidly become a Communist State of  50 million people which would be a grave menace to its neighbours.  It was also.. desirable that leading people from the United Kingdom should visit Indonesia Ministers, officials and business men otherwise, now that the Dutch had gone, the indonesian people would lose all contact with Western thought and influence.I     At the end of these statements the Prime Minister said that he would like tomake some concluding remarks.   In his opening statement he had made a&apos; somewhat stark presentation of the facts.   This was, after all, a staff conferenceand it was salutary on such occasions to see the difficulties clearly and to set them out as bluntly as possible.  This did not mean, however, that they could not be overcome.   He certainly had no intention of presiding over the liquidation ofI the British Empire, and he was in no way pessimistic about the future.   It was,natural that people of his age. in measuring Britain&apos;s influence in the world, shouldtake the 19th Century as their standard of comparison.   But he was inclined tothink that this was misleading.  In the perspective of British history as a whole the19th Century was an exceptional period.   Being the first to reap the fruits of theindustrial revolution, we had built up very rapidly in the second half of thatcentury a position of pre-eminence political, military and economic throughout
the world.  We wielded enormous power and were able for a time to do almost?anything we liked.   But there had been, in earlier centuries, periods when we3exercised an almost equal influence from a position of much less relative strength.In the days of Elizabeth I we were a small Power facing two giants on the one side the Emperor, and on the other Philip of Spain, who owned half the oldworld and claimed all the new.   By ingenuity and resource the Elizabethanscontrived to secure great material gains as opportunity offered without, for manyyears, seeking a direct quarrel with either.   In the age of Anne, another great jperiod in our history, Marlborough contrived to achieve a position of outstandingauthority in Europe, though the British forces under his command were relatively ismall.   He learned how to work through allies and to make the best use of hisopportunities. Now, once again, having lost our pre-eminence in material strength,we had to learn to exert our influence in other ways.  Once more we should beliving by our wits, as we had in earlier periods of our history. This was a challenge to the younger generation and it was, he believed, a challenge.to which theywould respond.  It was natural that, in the years immediately after the war, thedesire for security should have been uppermost in their minds.   But there were already signs of a more adventurous spirit, and for himself he looked forward to.the future with confidence.  The second half of the 20th Century would certainly be an exciting and adventurous period in our history.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.20th January, 1958.NEW ZEALANDRecord of a discussion between the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and&apos;New Zealand in Auckland on 20th January, 1958In Auckland on Monday evening, 20th January, after dinner, Mr. Nash and;Mr. Macmillan had a lengthy informal discussion in Mr. Macmillan&apos;s sitting-room.%Sir Norman Brook, Sir George Mallaby and Mr. A. D. Mclntosh were also present.;After Mr. Nash had briefly referred to his own availability for talks and tojpossible arrangements, he invited Mr. Macmillan to discuss whatever he wished.jMr. Macmillan suggested that talks in Wellington be reserved for specific issues&apos;which might be placed on an agenda, and he himself would just touch on some of \the broad world issues. Mr. Nash, in agreeing to this course, felt that Mr.-Macmillan would find that we in New Zealand would want to do whatever the]United Kingdom wished to do, and especially in respect of the British policy of)making people free. Mr. Nash referred briefly in this connection to what the!United Kingdom had done in Kenya and what was being done in South Africa. He]believed that the British outlook was in many respects better than that of the!United States on colonial issues, on which the United Kingdom appeared to havejbetter vision.Mr. Macmillan began by referring to the two great divisions amongst people!to-day: the free world on the one side with its well-defined attitude towards life,!and on the other the Kremlin, which had the advantages of inner lines of!communication. The Russians did not appear to bother about their satellites, forlexample, when they wanted to write a note. The United Kingdom, on the other!hand, and the other members of the free world for that matter, always had to actsas members of a coalition. The United Kingdom had always faced crises asjfmembers of a coalition. They had always been natural members of a grotnj&quot;engaged in opposing dictatorships. One of the other strange characteristics of thepresent day was the fact that the Communists appeared to have a stronger faith in]their cause at the periphery than in the centre. It seemed quite clear that those hiMoscow did not believe in the Communist faith with as much zeal as those falaway, for example, in Asia. Mr. Macmillan felt that Communism did haveslightly oriental tinge. After all, it did originate in its modern form from two men of oriental origin. He felt that the battle of the ideological front might last a hundred years, and this battle would have its long phases. We for our part should!not try to get all our forces into the same mould. Many of the uncommitted^countries, for example, were working on parallel lines. Sweden, he felt, was making:
i 11as good a contribution as many of the countries in NATO, and the Finns wereaking a very staunch effort in  their own way and under most difficultircumstances.Mr. Macmillan then went on to discuss the great importance of India. if she stayed firm she would prove to be a great bulwark for the free world. He feltthat some of his own people did not understand Nehru, but he himself felt that hehad gained a much better appreciation of what Nehru was trying to do. TheUnited Kingdom was in fact enjoying very good relations with the Indians, andthey had indeed endeavoured to give a great deal of assistance. Nehru was, ofcourse, taking tremendous risks with his own economy, and the United kingdom had helped very considerably, especially in the release of wartime balances whichhad run down very rapidly from  1,000 millions to something like  200 millions.Nehru was having his Five-Year Plan because that is the up-to-date and fashionablething to do. Mr. Macmillan appreciated that Nehru had to have a Five-Year Plansince if he did not, how could he help his people, who could always turn to the example of China which was proceeding on these planned lines. Despite the poorstandard of living in India Nehru was doing his best and holding on. The Westreally should try to help him more, and Mr. Macmiilan referred to the veryhealthy state of some of the Western countries like Germany with their largebalances. At a later stage in discussing the economy of India Mr. Macmillancommented by way of parenthesis that various countries&apos; obsessions seem to ariseout of their past history. Germany, for example, had suffered greatly frominflation after the first war, and their policies were therefore directed towards the avoidance of such a calamity again. The United Kingdom, on the other hand,had suffered mostly from unemployment, and British policy always tended,therefore, to be directed towards avoiding a repetition of that particular type ofcalamity.Continuing his discussion on India, Mr. Macmillan pointed to the fact thatthere was a second great factor in India: well-trained, well-qualified officials. india had been served well by the old members of the Indian Civil Service who had been trained when the British went out. At that stage, only about 500 had been British,the rest Indians, and these trained Civil Servants were standing India in very goodstead. There was also the legal system which was an English creation under LordMacaulay, and to this day Indians flocked to London for their legal education.Mr. Nash referred to the announcement over the BBC that very morning tothe elTcct that the Indian Congress Party had voted strongly in favour of&quot;theretention of English as an official language in India. Mr. Macmillan discussed at some length the language problem and the status of Hindi as a sort of lingua-franca and the only possible alternative for English but, he pointed out, the task of producing textbooks and science books in any of the Indian languages wasaltogether too formidable. The great tragedy in India, it seemed to him, lay in thefact that while Britain had given the country unity it had, in going out so quickly,had to abandon a united India in favour of partition. He felt that a secular state was preferable to the theocratic set-up in Pakistan. The six years of war wouldhave to be held responsible for what had occurred. Nehru had succeeded to an english-created structure, but in order to maintain the spirit of the Congress Partyhe had to play up independence, not in any spirit of animosity, but more in the historical sense to create an Indian tradition and an Indian feeling. Nehru appearsto argue that since he has to fight Communism he has to make India appear to be,and to be in fact, a world Power with himself as a figure of international importance.This has resulted in his attitude of neutralism. While an uncommitted India is oftendisagreeable to the United Kingdom, she in turn recognises that Nehru was trying to create for India something of its own, and in fact its liberal though neutralistoutlook meant that spiritually she was on our side.There was some speculation as to what would happen to the Congress Partyif it did not maintain some vitality. Mr. Macmillan gave the analogy of the SinnFein Party in Ireland which, having gained independence, then proceeded to dieaway because the driving and unifying force of the grievance had been removed and nothing had been found in substitution. The diverse elements in India hadto be kept together in some fashion, and it seemed sensible that the Congress party should continue to provide the common bond. What would happen after Nehrifsdeath, of course, no one knew, but the elements of disagreement were clearly there.One had only to look, for example, at what was happening in the old Travancore,where the Communists had gained the upper hand.  To sum up, Mr. MacmillanTOP SECRET53456 h
said that the two methods Nehru appeared to be using to keep the country unitewere economic progress under the Five-Year Plan and a vigorous Indian foreignpolicy. Again he stressed the analogy of Ireland, and the fact that since Nehrudid have a unifying theme it was in our interest to give him all possible support.   *The next item he touched on was Kashmir, as very much a nigger in the-woodpile. Mr. Macmillan referred to his own conversations with Suhrawardy,whom he found very sensible, very shrewd, though as a character not whollyadmirable. He had specially advised Suhrawardy to solve the water problem.This was then discussed at some length, with stress on the danger period in about1960-61, when India would be in a position to ruin Pakistan by taking the water,and thus even driving Pakistan into war. It seemed most unfortunate that each country should want to pursue its own water solution, and that the two could not&apos;get together into some sort of vast Tennessee Valley type project which wouldprovide enough water for both, in contrast to the existing Indian plans which appeared to envisage the diversion of some rivers in such a way as to result in a lower total content, and of course to the possible ruin of Pakistan interests. Mr.Macmillan observed that Pakistan to-day was in very large measure a product of the aeroplane. It could not very well be governed except by means of flying.He described the situation in the area of old East Bengal which not so very long ago had been forcibly converted to Mohammedanism by its Maharatta ruler. Onthe whole, Pakistan appeared to be somewhat of a ramshackle structure with itsshortage of water, its lack of resources and trained men, and its general instability.For example, it had not yet been possible to hold elections. Notwithstanding all this, it was very much to the British interest to try to help Pakistan.Mr. Macmillan commented that the British to-day were stronger in Indiathan ever before. Eighty-five per cent, of the capital flowing into India came fromBritish sources, and the Indian attitude towards British interests was getting better.China was still a bugbear, and the Indians always felt in respect of China that theymust always do better. It was mentioned that possibly four out of nine people who lived in countries which held free elections were Indians. Mr. Macmillan feltquite sure that Nehru did not like the Russian-form Government. He muchpreferred his own.Mr. Nash felt that Nehru&apos;s attitude fostered our own approach but in adifferent way. Whereas we were strongly and openly anti-Communist, Nehru waspossibly equally so but in a different fashion. Mr. Macmillan referred to Nehru&apos;sdislike of regional pacts, and said that he had pointed out to Nehru that if theWest had not created NATO what would have happened? Mr. Nash commentedthat it had seemed to him at one stage that France and Italy would almost certainlygo Communist. The-type of government which Togliatti would have produced,for example, would have resulted in Communism making such substantial gainsthat Western civilisation in Europe would have gone into the melting-pot in fifty years. Mr Nash felt that the West did not perhaps support Nehru with as muchenthusiasm as it supported the United States. He himself felt above all that Nehruwas the greatest cohesive influence serving the free world in the East. Mr.Macmillan agreed, but commented that Nehru in India was living under Westernprotection. In his discussions with Nehru on disarmament, he had pointed outthat the United Kingdom and the United States were not willing to get rid of nuclear weapons and find themselves at the mercy of the superior conventional forces of the USSR. He said that he had discussed this in a spirit of franknesswith Nehru, going on to point out that he himself had bought Hawker Hunterfighters ostensibly for protection against the Russians but actually for use againstthe Pakistanis. And he had, he said, added the comment: &quot;Why should I dodifferent from you.&quot; Britain obviously could not put itself at the mercy of theRussians. Mr. Macmillan said that he had urged both Pakistan and India to stoptheir arms race, and he went on to say that if the United Kingdom and russia would both halve their defence efforts they could devote corresponding savings tomost valuable peaceful purposes.Mr. Macmillan felt that nevertheless Nehru was playing his own hand in the-most suitable way, and he might very well be doing the best thing by being neutral.vui j. nil UnlullWU.. So sUNDER SECTION 3 (4) Tip secret
[this is a copy, the original isi retained under section 3 (4)i of the public records actMr. Macmillan emphasised that we were a strange Commonwealth. It was essential to keep the Asians in, and it was equally essential that we must not getnnoyed with each other. We had to maintain our volume of world strength, andthe Commonwealth to-day was a nucleus we must strive to keep. India was, heReiterated, a most important component, and on the whole he felt it was wonderfulat both the Indians and the Pakistanis were as good as they are.In answer to Mr. Nash&apos;s question about Bandaranaike he said he did not knowim as well as Nehru.  While he found him shrewd and quick, he did not feel he^understood him, but he should be all right if he could keep afloat.  He seemed to ber a jolly good fixer,&quot; but without any fixed principle or policy.   Bandaranaike wasvery much in the position of the unlikely candidate at an election, never expecting to-get in, having signed all the questionnaires, having promised to do all sorts ofincompatible things, who suddenly finds himself put into office and not knowinggfexactly how he is going to square all his promises.  Financially and economically,Ceylon was in a fairly sound state. She had about f70 million credits, lots of dollars.I/plus export surpluses, and despite price variations there was the whole quantities of$tea, rubber, cocoa, copra and such things that Ceylon had to sell.   He felt that onBthe whole Ceylon had a very interesting Government which reminded him a greatIdeal of eighteenth century politics.  The system appeared to be not one so muchl;of party, but of making valuable connections, and he could not help being somewhatTamused by his own position in discussing all these points with Bandaranaike:rThere was I, a Tory Minister, but with all our faults I was able to talk to him quitefrankly and he appeared to be quite friendly and understanding &quot;.In reverting to Pakistan in answer to a question. Mr. Macmillan stressed that&quot;both sides appeared to have become aware of the grave state of their respectiveeconomies brought about by the arms race, and he emphasised that neither the americans nor the British gave either side any aid which could be regardedas aggressive.  On the contrary, it was always the policy to try to confine military aid to the defensive side.  For example, aid to India had been given in the form of fighters, but when it came to bombers these had to be bought and the same appliedIto Pakistan.   Mr. Macmillan mentioned that he had done his best to get the twoPrime Ministers of India and Pakistan together during the Prime Ministers&quot; meeting in London, and they had in fact got together and talked quite amicably for some time.  He had tried to get them to come to some arrangement over the five rivers,$but he was afraid without success.On Indonesia Mr. Macmillan said that he did not know very much. There wasa general discussion on the existing situation, Mr. Nash outlining his views on theDutch attitude and expressing the opinion that the present actions of the Indonesiansagainst Dutch nationals could only be regarded as horrifying.   On the subject of[(possible action on the part of the United States and the United Kingdom to assistIpther elements in Indonesia, Mr. Nash expressed very grave doubts.  Mr. Macmillanpaid that Nehru had told him that he intended to speak quite severely to Sukarno.llHis own meeting in New Delhi with him (Sukarno) was of a momentary nature andiiad been somewhat played up to the propaganda advantage of Sukarno.   BothfPrime Ministers agreed that the West Irian claim was a very unsubstantial one.gMcDermott, the United Kingdom Ambassador at Djakarta had told Mr. Macmillanrat a meeting he had attended in Singapore that on the whole a break-up of the^Government in Indonesia appeared to be a bad thing.  If lava, with its 50 millionople, went Communist the resulting Government would be so incompetent as to(ead to collapse and subsequent greater Communisation.   In answer to a further questions on Malaya, Mr. Macmillan felt that the Malayans were not at all happyTOP SECRET53456   .. h 2
112 -zjiand certainly not at all impressed by what was happening in Indonesia.  The two ;Prime Ministers had some discussion on the strength and menace of the Chinesecommunities in South-East Asian countries.Mr. Nash hoped that it would be possible to have further discussions onANZAM, ANZUS and SEATO. These topics were all touched on very briefly, but no definite views were expressed. Mr. Macmillan, in sorting the various bodies&quot;outin his mind, referred to ANZUS as the one that did not include us the one we didnot like.&quot; Mr. Nash explained how ANZUS had come about as a result of theJapanese Peace Treaty negotiations, and after some discussion Mr. Macmillanseemed more disposed to accept our view that ANZUS was mainly a useful informalbody enabling Australia and New Zealand to get together with the Americans in washington from time to time just as the United Kingdom themselves did in bilateraltalks, ft also appeared to be accepted that, since there could not be an inner circlein SEATO of some of the white countries, ANZUS did enable the three whitepartners to get together without upsetting the Asians.Mr. Macmillan commented that ANZUS in relation to SEATO, the bigger andmore active body, seemed very much like W.E.U. of the old Brussels Treatyarrangement in relation to NATO. On SEATO and its membership, Mr. Nash feltthat he would like to urge Nehru if ever he met him that India*s interest would be best served if they joined SEATO and thus assure themselves as to its non-aggressivepurposes. Mr. Macmillan did not think this would prove acceptable to Nehru. Itwas agreed to discuss ANZAM and SEATO further in Wellington, and there mightbe further discussion on Communist China. Mr. Nash outlined briefly the nature ofthe problem as far as we were concerned, and Mr. Macmillan discussed at some length juridical recognition. He felt that the current misconceptions, particularly inthe United States, as to the significance of recognition had greatly confused this problem. He defended the classical thesis approach as against the moralconnotation which the Americans under Mr. Dulles had insisted on taking intoaccount.There was some discussion on Formosa; very little as to its future, but somemutual questionning as to the position of the Formosans themelves, their numbers and tatus in relation to the Chinese. Mr. Nash hoped that Mr. Macmillan would refer to disarmament and nuclear tests in the discussion in Wellington. Mr. Nashsaid that he felt that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s statement on a non-aggression pact had done a lot of good. Mr. Macmillan hoped that this was so. He felt that it would not prove a harmful approach. As to relations with the Russians generally, he felt thatthe business of writing letters should really be stopped somehow or other. Itreminded him of the eighteenth century form of writing novels and was indeed a verycurious development. On the subject of negotiations with the Russians, he thoughtthese would have to be taken seriously, and the West must try to get negotiationsput to the test. Mr. Nash felt that the way Mr. Macmillan had proposed was a sound one, namely that the two sides should get together at various levels, officialsfirst, then Foreign Ministers, and eventually Heads of State. Mr. Macmillan agreed and he then outlined the elements of the problem of the composition of the talks.Who in fact was to go? Was it to be the NATO Powers on the one side and the warsaw Powers on the other? If so, this would lead to an impossible situationvis-a-vis the Germans. The West Germans would be quite unwilling to sit down with the East Germans, whose existence they did not recognise. Mr. Macmillanwondered if it would not be possible to work to find some method by whichrepresentatives could be chosen from the two sides, but not necessarily representativeof all; some way in which representatives would be cle facto rather than de iure.This problem was discussed at some length, but without reaching any clear view.Mr. Macmillan also referred to difficulties in getting the Russians to talk aboutdisarmament. It seemed to him essential that technicians should get together to study the nature of the problems involved. The problems of rights of inspection andso on.The discussion then developed along economic and financial lines, although itwas agreed that the substantial topics should be reserved for later talks. Mr. Nashexplained some of the difficulties confronting his Government on balance ofpayments, sterling funds and interest rates. Mr. Macmillan referred to Britishexperience after the 1951 crisis. These aspects were dealt with at some length and towards half past twelve the discussion ended with agreement that subjects not dealtwith could be taken up again in Wellington. Mr. Nash hoped that Mr. Macmillanwould be able to give some general talk to Cabinet and would enable Ministers toask questions. To this course Mr. Macmillan readily agreed.
Mr. Nash also mentioned that he would like to have some discussion on theproposal for an international regime on the Antarctic. After outlining his viewsalong the lines of the statement he had given to the Press on 25th January, 1956,[f-Mr. Nash referred very briefly to the latest officials discussion in Washington.I Neither Mr. Macmillan nor Sir Norman Brook professed themselves familiar withthe latest development (which was being canvassed on the official level), and said they would want to consult their brief before they could usefully discuss the matter.The main subjects left over for discussion in Wellington to which both PrimeMinisters had referred during the evening were as follows :  Disarmament and Nuclear Tests.Prospect and Problems of Negotiation with USSR.Relations with Communist China.South-East Asian Defence and Regional Pacts ANZAM.ANZUS.SEATO.Relations with Malaya.International Regime for Antarctica.Economic Matters Sterling Balances.Protection of the Pound.Prices of Farm Products.Revision of Ottawa Agreement.Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference.European Free Trade Area.Department of External Affairs, Wellington,21st January, 1958.\ Record of a Discussion between the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom andNew Zealand in Wellington on 23rd January, 1958The Prime Minister, accompanied by Sir Norman Brook, the United Kingdom\ High Commissioner and Mr. J. M. C. James, called on Mr. Walter Nash (Prime; Minister of New Zealand) at 10-15 a.m. on 23rd January. Mr. Nash wasI accompanied by Mr. Alistair Mclntosh. For the discussion on SEATO (Item 5I below) he was joined by Mr. C. F. Skinner, Deputy Prime Minister, and Mr. P. G.I Connolly, Minister of Defence. The meeting lasted until 11-45 a.m. when Mr. Macmillan attended a meeting of the New Zealand Cabinet.f 1. ChinaMr. Nash said that his party, when in opposition, had favoured recognition off the Chinese Communist Government, and still did favour it. He believed that, asI that Government exercised authority throughout China, it was logical to recogniseI them as the Government of China. He was not, however, in any great hurry to take[ this step. Nor would he wish to take it without prior consultation with the UnitedI States Government.  He did not wish to give unnecessary offence in that quarter.Mr. Macmillan said that the Labour Government in the United Kingdom hadI similarly thought it logical to recognise the Chinese Communist Government. ItI was, however, doubtful whether the United Kingdom had gained anything byI establishing diplomatic relations with that Government. They were not disposedI to show us any greater consideration on that account, e.g., in matters of trade, than   they showed to other countries which had not recognised them. Indeed, theyI thought our position illogical; for, although we had recognised them, we were notI willing to support their claim to the Chinese seat in the United Nations; and theyI seemed to regard our attitude on that point as even more unfriendly because weI had recognised them. The United States Government were, however, still insistentI that the Chinese Communist Government should not take the Chinese seat in theIt United Nations; and, in view of the importance which they attached to this, he hadI TOP SECRET
undertaken during his last visit to Washington to continue to support the Americanline of continuing to postpone any change in Chinese representation in the united nations.Mr. Macmillan added that, although the Americans remained inflexible on this latter point, there seemed to be some possibility that they might relax their attitudetowards trade with China. The United Kingdom Government had recently decidedto reduce unilaterally the restrictions on exports from the United Kingdom to china they had decided that those restrictions should be brought into line withthose on trade with the Soviet Union; and this decision had evoked much less protestin the United States than had been expected.Mr. Nash said that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s statement would be useful to the NewZealand Government when they came to decide what line they should take regardingthe recognition of the Chinese Communist Government.Commenting generally on the situation, Mr. Macmillan felt that Malaya was insome danger of becoming ultimately a Chinese colony and that a major effort mightbe needed to prevent this. Eventually the Communists might take Hong Kong,but meanwhile it suited them to allow it to be an outlet for trade.2. AntarcticaMr. Nash said that when he was in opposition in 1955, he had put forward aproposal that an international regime should be established in the Antarctic. Hehad therefore been much interested to learn, when he took office, that discussions on this question had been proceeding between officials of the United Kingdom,Australia, New Zealand and the United States. He understood that in these discussions broad agreement had been reached on a United Kingdom proposal forthe establishment of an international authority which would demilitarise the antarctic and promote co-operation between the countries concerned in itsexploration and development. This proposal contemplated that national claims inthe Antarctic should be regarded as frozen for as long as the international authorityremained effectively in operation. The United States officials had originally been reluctant to contemplate Russian participation in the proposed authority; but they now seemed to have been persuaded that, unless the Soviet Union were a part of it,the authority would be unable to control Russian activities in the Antarctic; andthey had now put forward an alternative version of the plan which was, he understood, broadly acceptable to the United Kingdom officials. Unfortunately,however, the Australian Government had now decided that they would not support this proposal for the establishment of an international authority since they were most reluctant to make the de facto surrender of Australian sovereignty which thisentailed, and were not convinced that this step would bring them correspondingadvantage.Mr. Macmillan agreed that this Australian decision was unfortunate. during his forthcoming visit to Canberra he would do his utmost to persuade the australian government to reverse it. He was glad to think that he could count on Mr. Nash&apos;ssupport in this. In his discussions with the Australian Government, and in furthertalks with the Americans, the following particular points should be stressed :  (f/) The basis of the proposed authority should be broadened to includecountries other than the United States, the Soviet Union and the sevencountries which at present had territorial claims in Antarctica. Tothese there should be added India, South Africa, Belgium and Japan possibly as a second tier of associated countries.(/)) Russian participation in the authority was of vital importance. WithoutRussian support the scheme would have no chance of practical success.(c) The scheme should be launched in the early summer of 1958 in order to forestall any alternative initiative at the next session of the general assembly of the United Nations.Mr. Nash said that he was in general agreement with what Mr. Macmillan had said. He hoped that, while he was in Canberra, Mr. Macmillan would be ableto persuade the Australian Government to modify their present attitude towards this problem.
3. ANZUS and ANZAM(a) ANZUSMr. Nash said that ANZUS had been of value to New Zealand especiallybecause it afforded regular opportunities for Australia and New Zealand to discuss with the United States military problems of common concern to the three countries.The United Kingdom Government had always been informed of the substance of the discussions at these meetings. He hoped that Britain would not object tothe continuance of this Pact.Mr. Macmillan said that he recognised that ANZUS had in practice proveduseful. The controversy which it had originally aroused in the United kingdom had now subsided. He did not at present wish to propose any change in theexisting arrangements. He hoped that eventually it would be recognised that th-3most practical method of organising military planning for the South-East Asianand Pacific areas would be on a quadripartite basis United States, UnitedKingdom, Australia and New Zealand.Mr. Macmillan said that he hoped that Australia and New Zealand would continue to base their military equipment and organisation on that of the UnitedKingdom and, to the fullest extent possible, to draw their equipment from united Kingdom sources. There had been a time when it would have beenreasonable to suppose that in a future war Australia and New Zealand wouldbe obliged to look to the United States, rather than to the United Kingdom, formilitary supplies. On the existing strategic hypothesis, however, all belligerentsin a future war would have to rely on the weapons which they held at the outset of hostilities. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom would be ableto maintain munitions production on any large scale after the nuclear exchange.(b) ANZAMMr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government had recently putforward certain proposals designed to improve the functioning of ANZAM andto make it more effective. These proposals did not involve the formation of anANZAM command or of collective ANZAM forces in peacetime. All that was intended was that the ANZAM Defence Committee should consider whatimprovements could be made by way of organising and training the forces of theANZAM countries which were likely to be in the area in an emergency, so thatthey would then be able to operate, if need be, as a joint ANZAM foi&apos;ce. Thiswould be explained to the United States Government at the appropriate stage.Mr. Nash said that New Zealand had been unwilling to send troops to Malayawithout the assurance that this was welcomed by the Malayans. Similarly, theywould not wish to keep troops in Malaya if, at a later stage, the MalayanGovernment asked for their withdrawal.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government were in exactly the same position. Malaya was now an independent member of theCommonwealth. Our troops were there at present by agreement with the MalayanGovernment; and if at any time the consent of the Malayan Government were withdrawn the troops also would have to be withdrawn.Mr. Macmillan said that this illustrated the dilemma which faced us in respectof the construction of permanent accommodation for the troops in Malaya. Thiswould be needed as soon as the operations against the bandits were completed and the troops were withdrawn from the jungle. The construction of a cantonmentat Malacca was specially urgent. It would cost something in the neighbourhoodof  7-1- millions. If we hesitated to go forward with this project, it would beassumed that we were doubtful about the stability of the Malayan Government.Admittedly, it was at least possible that within the next five years there wouldbe a Government in Malaya which was unwilling that our troops should remainthere and in that event money spent on the construction of the cantonmentwould be wasted. On the other hand, the Indonesians had alarmed the Malays,who were also keenly aware of the strength of the Chinese menace. So long asthe Malays remained in the majority they would probably wish to keep theCommonwealth force as a protection. On balance he had come to the conclusionthat permanent accommodation must be provided, at any rate at Malacca, though perhaps in some phased manner. He hoped that the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand would be willing to contribute towards the cost of this either
by sharing in the capital expenditure or by paying a rent which would include anlelement lor amortisation of part of the capital cost. In answer to Mr. Nash&apos;sfcomment that the United Kingdom land forces were being reduced, Mr. Macmillanexplained that although a decision had been taken in principle to reduce the present20 major units to 15&quot; in 1962 (X United Kingdom and 7 Gurkha) the numberswould on this basis drop only from 29,000 to 24,000, the latter figure being madup of 11,000 British and 13,000 Gurkha.4. SingaporeMr. Mcictnillan said that he hoped that Liin Yew Hock would hold his owin the forthcoming elections. He was the best political leader available in singapore, but his Party organisation was inadequate. It might be that thelections would be postponed. In any event, if the Communists gained political control in Singapore, the United Kingdom would feel obliged to resume direct government. We had retained the power to do so and would feel no difficultyin defending that decision. For the internal stability of Singapore was essentialto our military position there and this, in turn, was essential to our strategic needs in South-East Asia. It was a relevant consideration in this connection that about two-fifths of the population drew their livelihood from our various defenceinstallations in the island.Mr. Nash said that it was his impression that Britain was going too far itreducing her naval strength in Singapore.Mr. Macmillan said that under the latest plans for the reorganisation of theRoyal Navy there would be a substantial task force east of Suez which would bbased on Singapore. He gave details of this. It was true that this would not takej,up all the existing facilities at the naval dockyard in Singapore, for the aircraftfcarrier itself, with its extensive specialised equipment, would have to go to thetUnited Kingdom for refit. We were, however, anxious to maintain the existing!facilities at the dockyard, so far as practicable, and it was desirable that Australiaand New Zealand should make as much use of these facilities as possible forrefitting their own warships. It would also be helpful if commercial work couldbe placed there.Mr. Nash undertook to consider how New Zealand could help in this respect.5. SEATOMr. Nash said that SEATO was the most effective international organisation in this area. It had the great ideological advantage of combining, within a singleorganisation, Asian countries and countries of European stock.Mr. Macmillan said that he would like to emphasise that the planning we had it in mind to set on foot in the ANZAM context did not in any way conflict withthe SEATO organisation.Mr. Nash said that it would be important to explain to Admiral Stump thatANZAM was in fact a mutual way of arranging matters between the threeCommonwealth members of SEATO whose forces were organised in common antwas not in any way a rival to SEATO itself.In further discussion the point was made that, as military planning in SEAT(developed, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand would be undeincreasing pressure to declare the precise strength of the forces which they werprepared to commit to the area. The United States Government had not yet bee-forthcoming on this point; and the three Commonwealth Governments woulcertainly find it convenient to avoid for as long as possible committing themselvcto specific force contributions. We could make effective use of the argument th;the only land forces actually deployed in this area were the Commonwealth Foroin Malaya and Singapore.Mr. Macmillan said that SEATO should, in his opinion, remain a pure:military organisation. It would be a mistake to try to give it economic functionFor these were discharged, in this area, by the Colombo Plan Like tlCommonwealth itself, the Colombo Plan had the advantage that it brought togethboth the uncommitted and the committed countries and aid offered through It w
given without any military conditions. Moreover India was a member of the colombo Plan and it was quite unrealistic to suppose that India would be willingto join SEATO at any rate for many years to come.Mr. Nash said that he too would not wish to divert economic aid under the colombo Plan into the SEATO channel.Record of a Meeting of the New Zealand Cabinet held on 23rd January, 1958,and Attended by the Prime Minister of the United KingdomThe Prime Minister welcomed Mr. Macmillan and invited him to address the-meeting.Mr. Macmillan stated that he regarded it as a great honour and privilege toattend a meeting of the New Zealand Cabinet. He felt that the occasion underlinedthe unity of the British Commonwealth and its developing character. There were some critics who maintained that the changes in the structure and character of theCommonwealth during the last ten to fifteen years constituted a decline. Howeverin his view the process of change had in fact been a &quot;growing up &quot; based or, long experience which enabled the member countries not only to &quot;regard the past withpride, but to look forward tc a great future. The Commonwealth association of independent nations was unique in the history of the world.Mr. Macmillan referred to the former constitution of the Commonwealth asbeing based primarily on a common heritage of nationality, race and creed, althougheven from the inception of the Commonwealth the substantial French element InCanada had been a departure from this common background. HoweverCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conferences of the present da\ reflected the growing and developing nature of the Commonwealth by the inclusion of such countries as Pakistan, India, Ceylon and Ghana. Mr. Macmillan raised the question as to what, with the disappearance of any common racial, &amp;c, background, nowheld the Commonwealth members together. It appeared to him that&quot; the bindingforce was the common belief in the rights and importance of the individual as distinct from their subservience to the State. Commonwealth countries regarded the primary function of the State as the promotion of greater freedom and happinessamongst individuals. Symptomatic of this was the development in commonwealth countries of a Judicial System outside the executive machinery of Governmentwhich encouraged a proper respect for the law amongst the people. government itself was based on discussion rather than force and on the acceptance of the powersand rights of the majority with certain safeguards against their abuses.Mr. Macmillan regarded the contemporary division in the world scene as being based on this question of the protection of the rights of the individual. For thisreason he thought it important that Communist infiltration in the trade unions andother institutions should be strongly resisted, particularly in the Far East wheredeveloping countries were more readily susceptible to ideological influences.However the Communist tactics and methods were fundamentally dishonest in thatthey were inconsistent.Mr. Macmillan reviewed the present standing and function of theCommonwealth in the world scene. The Commonwealth provided a useful bridgefor the interpretation and greater understanding of Western ideas and philosophyby the less developed and the uncommitted countries.Mr. Macmillan referred to two important events during 1957; namely hismeetings with President Eisenhower in Bermuda and Washington. He hadapprecfated the delicacy of the approach by President Eisenhower in enabling theearlier meeting to be held on British territory. This meeting had made good progress although little more had been achieved than the re-establishment of friendly relations following the difficulties and misunderstandings that had arisendurin? the Suez crisis. The Middle East situation generally had called for a second meeting, which had been held in Washington in October 1957. In promoting such meetings, the United Kingdom was conscious of the difficulty of avoiding the suspicion of other countries that such meetings reflected a desire for an Anglo-American hegemony. However, he felt that the joint declaration issued at theconclusion of the Washington meeting had allayed many of these suspicions.Relations between the United States and the United Kingdom were now as closeas  if not closer than, ever before.   This relationship was reflected in close
112 -zvmco-operation at all levels of inter-Governmental machinery. Mr. Macmillan hadbeen impressed by the significance, some 200 years after the American Declarationof Independence, of the joint communique which had in effect been a &quot; Declarationof Interdependence.&quot; This interdependence had become necessary in order tomeet the Communist threat.Mr. Macmillan pointed out that any partnership or treaty arrangementinvolved some surrender of sovereign rights&quot;. Militarily this meant that countriesworking together should not individually provide balanced forces to meet a threat,but should rather provide a contribution to an integrated force which would beappropriately balanced in its overall structure. Such an approach had been followed by NATO. However, in circumstances where it was conceivable that individual countries might become separately involved in a conflict short of totalwar (e.g., a &quot; police &quot; action) it was essential that the individual countries concerned should maintain balanced forces. The United Kingdom did not envisage such a situation arising in Europe or the North Atlantic, but developments east of Sue2might in fact call for such individual action. For this purpose the United Kingdomendeavoured to maintain an appropriate degree of balance in her forces in theFar East and South-East Asia.Mr. Macmillan referred to the propaganda nature of the correspondence that had been received in recent months from the Kremlin. He was emphatic that theWestern countries should not take a cynical or defeatist view of such moves by theUSSR, but that these approaches should be properly tested for their sincerity andvalue in order to promote where possible consultation between the opposing groups.Mr. Macmillan reminded Ministers that in spite of their disarmamentpropaganda the Communist bloc had alone voted against the United Nationsresolution on this subject. The growing cost of building up military strength made it essential in Mr. Macmillams view that every possibility be examined of relievingcountries of this heavy burden without losing comparable power. This in fact wasthe basic test of the Soviet approaches on disarmament. Would the USSRmake comparable reductions in conventional arms as well as in unconventionalarms? There had been much propaganda against nuclear weapons, but very littleagainst war itself. It was clear that the Western Powers could not hope to prevailagainst Russia in a war fought solely with conventional weapons. It was worth noting that the USSR was building up substantial conventional Naval and AirForces, although these were supposedly outmoded by the development of nuclear weapons.The situation clearly called for further meetings between the free world andthe Communist countries. The Geneva meeting had not been properly prepared and had suffered accordingly. It was essential in Mr. Macmillan&apos;s view that such meetings should be preceded by careful study and preparation. Any disarmament,for instance, largely depended on technical considerations which had to be thrashedout at appropriate levels before suitable agreement was attainable at a summitconference. If the USSR really meant business it would welcome such preparatoryconsultation. Mr. Macmillan said that the idealist element in the United Kingdompeople wanted disarmament.The United Kingdom had learned a good deal from her atom and hydrogenbomb tests and as a result was now back on an equal partnership basis with theUnited States. In this respect the United Kingdom regarded herself as a trusteefor the Commonwealth. The influence which the United Kingdom had been ableto bring to bear as a result of her restored parity had resulted in greater flexibility in United States opinion.*In conclusion Mr. Macmillan expressed the view that at least for some timeto come the present conflict unhappily would continue. This, however, would notnecessarily mean war. There was little doubt but that the USSR would trampleon the free world if it allowed itself to become weak. In the circumstances, thepresent aim should be one of reducing tension and endeavour to assure theuncommitted countries of the justness of the Western approach, which was basedon reasonable strength plus endeavours for improvement in international relations.The current world conflict was largely one of a moral and spiritual nature.The Prime Minister thanked Mr. Macmillan for his interesting and informativeremarks and for his expressed willingness to make available any information he might possess on matters of interest or concern to New Zealand.
In reply to a question by Mr. Skinner, Mr. Macmillan stated that there hadnot been any appreciable softening in the otficiat United States attitude on thequestion of the recognition of the Communist regime in China. It was likely,however, that the United States generally was less &quot; one-eyed &quot; on this issue than previously. The United Kingdom&apos;s recognition of Communist China had causedsome complications, e.g., the problem of China&apos;s representation on the united nations. He felt it was logical that Communist China should be so admitted, butthat at the present time there were too many opposing considerations for the UnitedKingdom to support such a move.Mr. Connolly suggested that since, particularly in the Far East, the Communistthreat was more of a political than of a military nature, the Western Allies shouldbe more active on the political and ideological front. Mr. Macmillan agreed and stated that Communist countries had been substantially blocked on the militaryfront and were now endeavouring to turn &quot; the flank &quot; by ideological and economic warfare. However, recipient countries had in most cases found Soviet economic aid to be somewhat two-edged. He emphasised the importance of India&apos;s Five-year plan and expressed the view that the Commonwealth should endeavour to assist in ensuring the success of the plan.In reply to a question by Mr. Holloway regarding the supply by the UnitedKingdom of arms to Tunisia, Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom action had considerably upset the French Government. However, the French attitude on this issue had relaxed somewhat. The French were facing a difficult problem in Algeria with its population of approximately one million Frenchmen and someseven million Arabs. The United Kingdom saw the prospect of a similar problemfacing herself in the case of territories such as Kenya.Mr. Connolly raised the question of United Kingdom financial assistance toIndia. &quot;Mr. Macmillan pointed out that the United Kingdom had given Indiasuch assistance in a number of ways and that arrangements had now been madefor India to draw on her sterling balances. A sum of  750 millions had in fact been so drawn since the end of the war.In reply to a question by Mr. Moohan as to arrangements for the marketing ofNew Zealand produce in the United Kingdom, Mr. Macmillan expressed the viewthat the restoration of bulk purchasing arrangements would not be practicable under present conditions. However, remedies for the problem facing New Zealand hadbeen set down for discussion at a meeting on 24th January, 1958, between theCabinet Committee on Economic and Financial Policy and himself. He thoughtthat this preliminary discussion should be followed up by continued examination and consultation at the official level. Mr. Macmillan referred to the effect on international trade and on commodity prices in particular of the tight creditcontrol maintained by Germany and to a much less degree by the United Statesof America.When asked by Mr. Mathison whether he had any comment on the cyprus problem, Mr. Macmillan pointed out that this problem was not so much of a colonial as of an international nature. As a colonial problem it could have been dealt with in the normal way by progressive steps towards self-government.However, the complicating factor was the conflicting interests of Greece and turkey. _Record of a Discussion between the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom andNew Zealand in Wellington on 24th January, 1958Sir George Mallaby, United Kingdom High Commissioner, and Mr. James ofthe Commonwealth Relations Office were present with Mr. Macmillan.On the New Zealand side there were present: Mr. Skinner, Deputy PrimeMinister; Mr. Holloway, Minister of Industries and Commerce; Mr. Boord, Minister. of Customs; Mr. G. R. Laking, Prime Minister^ Department; and Mr. R. L.I Hutchens, Secretary to the Cabinet.I Proposed Revision of the Ottawa AgreementI Mr. Nash outlined the New Zealand case for a revision of the OttawaI Agreement. The Government would like to have the revision completed in Apriltin order to avoid any overlap with the preparations for the Commonwealth Tradeg and Economic Conference to be held in Canada later in the year.tt TOP SECRETm      53456 i 2
WZzxMr. Nash explained the view of the New Zealand Government that the balance .of advantage under the Ottawa Agreement had shifted against New Zealand. the substantial tariff preferences accorded to the United Kingdom in the New Zealandmarket had increased in value, being for the most part ad valorem duties. Asagainst this the preferences accorded to New Zealand in the United kingdom market, being specific rates of duty, had lost much of their protective value becauseof the substantial increase in prices. The guarantee of free entry for meat and themore recent guarantee of free entry for dairy produce, were of limited and decliningvalue, in the face of increased imports from other countries, and the rise in production in the United Kingdom. The Government and the producers were particularly concerned about dairy produce. New Zealand was exposed not onlyto the adverse effects of dumping by other European primary producers, but alsoto the consequence of the great increase in the use of United Kingdom milk forthe manufacture of cheese. At the same time the Ottawa Agreement wasnegotiated, the production of raw milk in the United Kingdom was not an important factor, but the switch to cheese manufacture had introduced an elementunfavourable to New Zealand.As regards the tariff preferences accorded to the United Kingdom, Mr. Nashpointed out that the 20 per cent, preference margin meant that in many casesmaterials for industry could be imported into the United Kingdom under lower rates of duty than applied to imports into New Zealand. This placed the NewZealand manufacturer at a disadvantage compared with his competitor in theUnited Kingdom.Mr. Nash also mentioned the need for New Zealand to be competitive with australia. It seemed to the New Zealand Government that the United kingdom market could no longer absorb the full export surpluses available from NewZealand. It was accordingly imperative for New Zealand to seek supplementarymarkets, but other countries could not be expected to buy from New Zealand unlessin return they were able to sell some goods to New Zealand. The Governmentdesired to continue to the fullest practicable extent the traditional policy of buyingfrom the United Kingdom wherever possible, and Mr. Nash did not suggest thatan attempt should be made to balance New Zealand&apos;s trade with other countries such as France and Italy. However, some bargaining power was necessary tosecure supplementary outlets for New Zealand primary production. The most effective counter was the offer of tariff concessions.Mr. Nash suggested accordingly that the fundamental principle on which theNew Zealand Government wished to secure agreement with the United KingdomGovernment was that New Zealand should have the right to reduce existing preferential tariff margins. He referred to the Agreement secured recently by australia and suggested that it should never be necessary for New Zealand to fight for a concession which had already been accorded to another country. He quotedinstances of the diversion of substantial orders to United Kingdom suppliers in circumstances where the goods could have been obtained at lower cost from other sources.At the invitation of Mr. Nash, Mr. Skinner elaborated the views of the NewZealand primary producers in relation to the sale of produce to the UnitedKingdom. He referred to the arguments which had been advanced during the talkswhich took place in November 1957 under the recently amended Ottawa Agreement.He pointed out that New Zealand had built up an efficient primary industry whichcould compete in any market provided there were free access. The onlycompetition which could defeat the New Zealand producer was the heavily subsided production characteristic not only of the United Kingdom but also ofether countries. The New Zealand producer would prefer to sell in the UnitedKingdom market to the maximum extent practicable.Mr. Holloway gave further instances of the manner in which the existingpreferences for imports from the United Kingdom operate to the disadvantage ofthe New Zealand manufacturer. He mentioned steel. Because of the existence-of the preferential rate of duty, the price of foreign steel was  16 per ton higher to;the New Zealand manufacturer than to a manufacturer in the United Kingdom.The United Kingdom steel supplier was thus able to increase his price for steelexported to New Zealand. A similar situation existed in respect of yarns;Mr. Holloway also referred to the adverse effects of the Ottawa Agreementrelation to imports from British non-self-governing territories. The fact that thebenefits of the Agreement were extended to territories like Hong Kong meant tha
in some cases a finished product from Hong Kong could be imported into NewZealand more cheaply than the raw materials could be obtained by a localmanufacturer.Mr. Macmillan suggested that the Agreements must either be taken as a wholeor abandoned. In his view, they were still applicable in general. He thought thatthe specific problems which confronted both countries could usefully be examined in detail by officials in the first instance. They could then be referred if necessaryfor further discussions between Ministers.As regards Hong Kong Mr. Macmillan said that the United KingdomGovernment would find it very difficult to discriminate now against a colony whichat the time the Ottawa Agreement was signed was not nearly such a large-scaleproducer.As to the agricultural policies of the United Kingdom, Mr. Macmillan saidthat the United Kingdom Government was concerned at the over-production of milk, which had been increased in recent seasons by exceptionally favourable weather conditions. The policy of the Government was to reduce the supply. they wanted to concentrate on the production of those things which the UnitedKingdom was best qualified to produce. Mr. Macmillan instanced feeding-stuffsfor livestock on which it should be possible to reduce the present expenditure on imports. He hoped that the pressure for reduction of the milk subsidies, whichhad been maintained for some time past, would be effective to decrease the surplus.Regarding the extent of the United Kingdom market for New Zealandproduce, Mr. Macmillan thought that increasing quantities could continue to be sold there. He noted that the consumption of butter was rising, encouraged nodoubt by the fall in price which brought it into better relation with the price of margarine. He was somewhat surprised that in the case of meat, consumptionhad not risen further, despite the rise in living standards. He mentioned severalfactors which he thought contributed to this situation, and drew the conclusionthat in general the British public had lost the habit of eating large quantities of meat and butter. He thought that a vigorous sales policy was necessary in respectof both commodities.Referring to the possible use of dumping legislation to discourage excessiveimports from European countries, Mr. Macmillan pointed out that both NewZealand and the United Kingdom were members of GATT. In the ordinary course immediate action could not be taken. It was necessary first to prepare a case for presentation to GATT. The collection of the necessary information had already begun. Mr. Nash suggested that in an emergency, however, therewas no hindrance to immediate action provided a case was put to GATT and their approval subsequently obtained. Mr. Macmillan agreed. However, it wouidnot be in the interests of the United Kingdom or indeed of New Zealand thathasty action should be taken. Anything which was done should be fully justifiablebefore the other members of GATT.In reply to points which had been raised by Mr. Nash and Mr. Hollowayabout joint tenders, Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom already hadextensive legislation to deal with restrictive trade practices. He suggested thatthere was not much room in present conditions for competitive tendering. Theprincipal elements of production (wages and raw materials) were much the samefor all manufacturers. It was necessary to strike a balance. He would not want to see a return to a general policy of price cutting such as prevailed in the slumpyears. It must have an effect on wages and in the result be substantially deflationary.Mr. Nash suggested that the real problem lay in the existence of very largeorganisations which tended to determine prices without disclosure of their costsby competitive tenders. Often these were based on quick recovery of initialcapital outlay for the purposes of continued expansion. This, in his view,constituted a tax on the consumer.At one point in the discussion, Mr. James, in replying to a comment byMr. Nash, said that the United Kingdom authorities would hope that New Zealand&apos;difficulties, which were fully recognised, could be met without the necessity for adjustment in the preference margins, but no indication was given by Mr. Nashor by any of the other New Zealand Ministers present that this was likely to bepossible.The Prime Ministers agreed that details of the New Zealand proposals shouldbe made available to the United Kingdom Government at the earliest possible
Hlzyn.AUSTRALIARecord of a Meeting between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom andthe Australian Cabinet held at Parliament House, Canberra, at 10-30 a.m.on 29th January, 1958On Wednesday, 29th January, 1958, at 10-30 a.m., Mr. Macmillan attended ameeting of the Australian Cabinet at which, in addition to the Cabinet Ministers,the Service Ministers were also present.Mr. Menzies welcomed Mr. Macmillan, who expressed his pleasure in visitingCanberra.Mr. Menzies invited Mr. Macmillan to speak on the major internationalquestions of current concern apart from the Asian problems which were to bediscussed at a separate meeting on the following day viz., Soviet relations and intentions, relations with the United States and the doctrine of interdependence.Mr. Macmillan began by summarising his impressions of the new commonwealth countries which he had visited in his present journey. He had found abundant signs of a remaining respect for the British people. This hethought to be important in the present state of world relationships.   The newmoment and that they should be discussed between officials of the two Governments(presumably in London) in April. It was agreed that the negotiations should ifpossible be completed well before the Governments became involved in theCommonwealth Trade and Economic Conference. A meeting in April wouldalso enable the same New Zealand officials to take part in the preparatorydiscussions for this Conference, which were scheduled to take place in Londonduring May.Capital Investment in New ZealandMr. Holloway referred to investigations which had been made into the feasibility of developing New Zealand ironsand deposits for the production of pig iron. These investigations had established that iron ore was present in sufficient quantities. The only problem seemed to be the presence of a high proportionof titanium. However, new processes were being developed to deal with this andthe expectation was that an industry could be established provided capital wereavailable. The Government was naturally interested to know what prospectsthere might be for the investment of United Kingdom capital in such a venture.It was expected that up to  20 millions would be required. Mr. Nash, incommenting on this point, said that the Government did not wish to borrowoverseas if this could be avoided. They would naturally prefer to see Britishcapital interest itself in the development.Mr. Macmillan said that he would be glad to have Lord Mills and other appropriate Ministers and authorities in the United Kingdom considerMr. Holloway&apos;s point.Production of UraniumMr. Skinner enquired about the possibility of assistance from the LInitedKingdom in the development of uranium deposits in New Zealand, and it was arranged that Mr. James should inform him about the latest developments inthe discussions which have been taking place for some time between the NewZealand authorities and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.Mr. Macmillan mentioned that at 6 a.m. on Saturday, 25th January (NewZealand time), an announcement would be made of certain very importantdevelopments which had taken place in the United Kingdom in the field of nuclear energy. Recent research at Harwell had suggested the possibility of producingnuclear power under controlled conditions by fusion rather than by fission. Ifthis proved practicable-and Sir John Cockcroft estimated that at least fifteen years would be needed to develop the process fully-power could be producedfrom water as the only element needed is heavy hydrogen.
Commonwealth countries were in a position to influence the uncommitted countriesjiand they could therefore be a channel through which the older countries of thejjCommonwealth could bring influence to bear on those countries.Mr. Macmillan went on to describe the course of Anglo-American relations[during the past year. When he took office those relations had been impaired by[the disagreement over the Suez question, and it had been one of his primary tasks[to restore them to their former footing. He had not however thought it right to[go to Washington immediately after taking office; and he had therefore been[grateful for President Eisenhower&apos;s suggestion of a meeting on British soil, at^Bermuda. At that meeting he had been able to re-establish his personal relations[with the President and to make some progress towards a better understanding[between the two Governments. But at that time Mr. Dulles and the State&quot;Department had not been ready to accept anything like a close working-relationship. During the summer, the position had changed largely as a result[of continuing Soviet successes in the Middle East; and during the crisis in Syria;very close consultation was established between the Foreign Office and the state department. When, at the Presidents invitation, he went to Washington inOctober, he found a very different atmosphere. The United States administration had been greatly alarmed, both by the political successes which the SovietGovernment had achieved in the Middle East, and also by the successful launching of the sputniks. The latter, in particular, had captured the imagination of theAmerican public who were shocked by the realisation that Americantechnological supremacy could no longer be taken for granted. As a result, therewas for the first time a growing readiness to recognise that, despite her vast powerand resources, even the United States could not alone withstand the challenge of soviet Communism. This was the climate of opinion in which the doctrine ofinterdependence was evolved. The &quot; Statement of Common Purpose &quot; which hadbeen published at the end of the meeting was in effect a declaration ofinterdependence.The practical results which had emerged from this meeting were three. First,President Eisenhower had undertaken to invite Congress to pass legislationamending the McMahon Act so as to enable the results of American nuclearresearch to be made available to other friendly Governments. This was a greatprize; and, if the amendment were carried, it should make it possible for theUnited Kingdom to avoid the greatly increased expenditure which they would otherwise have to incur in remaining a nuclear Power. Secondly, the old Anglo-American partnership of the war years had been re-established. It had been recognised that the United Kingdom had a special position, in relation to theUnited States, which was different from that of other European countries. Thiswas not a bid for Anglo-American hegemony: the two Governments were anxious;to put themselves at the service of their Allies in the free world: and they were&quot;resolved to work through the various Alliances of which they were members.Thirdly, it had been agreed that the resources of all the countries of the free worldshould be mobilised, on the concept of interdependence, to counter Soviet threats.:A start had been made in applying this concept of interdependence in the field of^research, development and production of weapons; and detailed studies had beentset in hand in the first instance on an Anglo-American basis.Mr. Macmillan illustrated the application of interdependence with particular[reference to naval strength. As it was inconceivable that the United Kingdom[should become involved in war in Europe except as part of the North Atlantic[Alliance, it was proposed that United Kingdom naval forces west of Suez should^not in themselves be balanced forces but should be organised as a contribution to[-the NATO naval forces.   East of Suez, on the other hand, it was possible that[United Kingdom forces might be required to operate alone, either in a policeaction or in a limited war; and it was therefore proposed that our naval forceseast of Suez should be balanced forces.Mr. Macmillan said that the North Atlantic Alliance had three main purposes.First, to keep the United States forces in Europe. Secondly, to provide a sufficientshield or trip-wire to prevent Soviet infiltration and, in the event of a major attack,to hold the position for long enough to enable the strategic nuclear weapon to be deployed against the Soviet Union. Thirdly, to sustain the morale of the european countries and to prevent political subversion through the spread of Communism.It was therefore a main object of Soviet policy to undermine the Alliance so as toring about the withdrawal of United States forces from Europe.
The Soviet Union had no present intention of embarking on major war,because of the power of the nuclear deterrent. We should soon reach the stage ofstalemate which Sir Winston Churchill had foreseen. And stalemate was certainlybetter than war. It was, however, illogical to suggest as some people did that because there was at present little risk of war our nuclear strength should be abandoned. It was only our possession of nuclear strength that averted war; andthat strength must be kept up if the stalemate was to be continued. We could not afford to dismantle our defences by forswearing the use of nuclear power.On the other hand, the cost of maintaining that strength indefinitely wasformidable; and the British people would only continue to make the sacrifices whichthis involved if they were satisfied that there was no other way of preserving thepeace of the world. Therefore, we must continue our efforts to reach a disarmamentagreement which would have the effect of securing parity of strength, and thecontinuance of the stalemate, at a lowcl level of effort. It was important that afurther attempt should be made to break the deadlock in the disarmamentdiscussions. It was equally important, from the point of view of the morale of the democracies, that the sincerity of Russian protestations should be put to the testAs he had said, the British people and this was probably true of other democraciesin the free world would not be willing to continue to make the sacrifices involvedin maintaining their defensive preparations unless they were satisfied that this effort was necessary and was undertaken in a just cause. It was these considerations which led him to think that the time was ripe for a so-called &quot; summit &quot; meeting of heads of Governments. He agreed that such a meeting was unlikely to be fruitfulunless the ground had been adequately prepared in advance. There should firsbe agreement on the agenda and procedure; and it would be preferable that a seriesof specific practical proposals should be prepared for discussion. If, however, theseconditions could be fulfilled a meeting of Heads of Governments would be valuableIf practical results were achieved, international tensions would be relieved. If notpublic opinion throughout the free world would accept more readily the need for continued military preparedness. The free world could not afford to lower itsguard.In answer to questions by Australian Ministers, Mr. Macmillan made thefollowing additional comments:  (ci) During the past year the United States Government had been well disposedand helpful to the United Kingdom and he believed that this attitude would be maintained. It was true that there was some ambivalence intheir attitude towards the British Commonwealth partly jealousy andpartly admiration. But they were increasingly willing to work inco-operation with Commonwealth countries.(b) The Commonwealth as a whole was in a stronger position at present todevelop its influence in world affairs and it might be desirable for commonwealth countries to work together to develop this influence.(c) There were substantial difficulties in the way of an agreement for thelimitation of armaments but these were not insuperable. From the1Western point of view an effective system of national inspection andcontrol was an essential part of any acceptable agreement. But it wasnot impossible that the Russians might ultimately accept this. Thequestion of Germany&apos;s reunification need not be regarded as a condition precedent to a disarmament agreement. It was in reality a separatepolitical issue.(ci) The advent of inter-continental ballistic missiles would not reduce the needfor an agreement on disarmament.   The political decision to use the nuclear weapon, otherwise than by way of retaliation, would involvesupreme test of nerves.(e) The political contest with Russia at the moment was to win the uncommittedcountries. This meant that the Western countries must keep up theirown living standards by way of example and help raise living standards in the uncommitted countries. In this context he thought that india was of the first importance. He had sought to persuade the UnitedStates to assist India because an economic failure there could be a majorreverse in the world struggle.Mr. Menzies referred to the present proposals for a summit meeting.   one reason for such a meeting would be to discover what headway could be made
Jpwards lessening tension and reaching practical agreements with the Russians.3ut in present circumstances, a more important reason would be to maintain a[healthy state of morale and public opinion in Western countries. He thought that3ulganin&apos;s letters had made an impact on public opinion in the free world. he agreed with Mr. Macmillan&apos;s view that Western peoples expected theirjovernments to act in good faith; and he believed that a summit meeting wouldbe valuable, not because he over-estimated the likely concrete results, but because it would restore the morale and faith of the Western peoples. For these reasons hethought that the need for advance preparations and preliminary lower level talksshould not be pressed to the point of preventing a summit meeting being held.Mr. Macmillan said that, while he himself was fully in sympathy with that view,^account must also be taken of the views of the United States Government.In concluding the meeting Mr. Menzies expressed, on his own behalf and that\ol his Cabinet colleagues, their thanks for the interesting review of the world situation which Mr. Macmillan had given.I Record of a Discussion Between the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdomand Australia in Canberra at 2-45 p.m. on 29th January, 1958I&quot; The Meeting was held in Mr. Menzies&apos; room in Parliament House. The PrimeMinister was accompanied by Sir Norman Brook. Mr. Menzies was accompaniedby Mr. E. J. Bunting.  The following topics were discussed.1. Irish CredentialsMr. Menzies referred to the message which he had had from Mr. Macmillanabout the terms of accreditation of the new Australian Ambassador in Dublin. Hewas most anxious to avoid using any language which might be embarrassing to theUnited Kingdom Government or might be represented as implying Australiansupport for the ending of partition in Ireland. On the other hand it seemed to him that it would be difficult to continue indefinitely to avoid using the description ofthe President of the Irish Republic which was incorporated in the constitutionof the Republic when a man had, as it were, a statutory name, it was unreasonable to decline to use it. Moreover, the Irish authorities were now willing that, if the letters of accreditation were addressed to &quot; The President of the Republic ofIreland,&quot; they should be sent in the name of Her Majesty as Queen of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia, &amp;c. It was also proposed that they should be accompanied by an exchange of letters in which itwould be made clear that the language used in the letters of accreditation did not imply any recognition of territorial claims by the Republic of Ireland.Mr. Menzies thought that this was a reasonable compromise since, whileobserving the courtesies, it would fully preserve the position of Northern ireland as a part of the United Kingdom. It was much to be preferred to the courserecently taken by the Canadian Government in accrediting their new ambassador to Dublin; and it could, without danger, become a pattern for the exchange ofrepresentatives generally between Commonwealth countries and the Republic ofIreland.Mr. Macmillan said that he would consider this matter again, in the light ofI what Mr. Menzies had said. He undertook to give Mr. Menzies a final reply beforeKthe end of his visit to Australia.2. Nuclear WeaponsMr. Menzies said that he might be subjected to some public pressure for\ Australia to develop a capacity to produce nuclear weapons. This was more likely\ to happen if France became a nuclear Power. For himself he would not be ini favour of Australia developing a nuclear capacity. He thought that Australia^-contribution could best be made in the form of conventional forces; a nuclearcapacity could only be found at the expense of reducing Australia^ strength in^conventional forces.   He was therefore interested to know what prospects thereiwere of preventing other Powers from developing a nuclear capacity.
Mr. Macmillan said that it was the strong desire of the United StatesGovernment that no further Powers should develop the capacity to producefnuclear weapons. The United Kingdom Government shared this view. On the!other hand, it was difficult for them to bring pressure to bear on the French who-iwere anxious, for prestige reasons, to develop a nuclear capacity. It was primarily for the United States Government to prevent this; but, so far, they had been slow!to formulate any practical plan for doing so. IMr. Macmillan went on to explain the general attitude of the United KingdomGovernment towards the use of nuclear weapons supplied by the United States on]the &quot; key of the cupboard &quot; basis. He suggested that the Australian Government^should take account of this in military planning against the possibility of atomic&apos;;war in the South-East Asian or Pacific areas. It would be useful if discussions:could be held, between the Australians and United Kingdom military authorities!about the possibility of equipping Australian facilities (airports, bombers, &amp;c.) inthis area in such a way that they could, if need arose, use atomic weapons providedeither by the United Kingdom or by the United States.Mr. Menzies, summing up this discussion, said that there was agreement on the,following points:   1(a) It should be an object of policy of both Governments to restrict the capacity?to produce nuclear weapons to the three countries now possessing them:(b) Every effort should be made to dissuade France from developing such a capacity.(c) The primary responsibility for (b) must rest with the United StatesGovernment.(d) Military planning by the Australian authorities should take account ofthe possibility that Australian facilities in the South-East Asian andPacific areas might be needed for the use of nuclear weapons providedby the United Kingdom or United States.3. Press conference it was agreed that any public announcement about the subjects discussedduring Mr. Macmillan&apos;s visit should be reserved until the eve of his departure from australia. It was also agreed that no joint communique should be issued to thePress. It was provisionally agreed that the two Prime Ministers should hold a jointPress Conference on the last day of Mr. Macmillan&apos;s visit (Tuesday, 11th February).4. Meetings of Commonwealth Prime MinistersMr. Menzies asked whether there was any intention of holding a Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers during 1958. He himself was disposed to thinkthat this would be unnecessary partly because of the journey which Mr. Macmillanhad undertaken to five Commonwealth countries, and partly because it was undesirable to give the impression that such Meetings were held annually. his view was that, while in the past these Meetings had not been held sufficiently often,there had in recent years been some tendency towards holding them too frequently.Mr. Macmillan agreed. He said that he did not contemplate any such meeting in 1958. IAs regards the location of these Meetings, Mr. Menzies said that, while hehad at one time been disposed to favour the idea of holding them in other commonwealth capitals, he had now come round to the view that London was thebest location. It was more difficult for the Prime Minister of the United kingdom to get away from London than it was for other Commonwealth Prime ministers to leave their capitals. Moreover, London was a world centre; and it was useful for other Commonwealth Prime Ministers to go there. There were also great advantages in holding these Meetings in a capital where Commonwealth PrimeMinisters (including those from countries which no longer owed allegiance to theCrown) could have Audiences with the Sovereign. Finally, there was the point thatthere were some Commonwealth capitals to which some Commonwealth PrimeMinisters would be reluctant to go. If however it was desirable, for these reasons,that Meetings of Prime Ministers should be&apos; held in London, that made it even moredesirable that Meetings of other Commonwealth Ministers (Finance Ministers, &amp;c.)should be held in capitals outside London. This practice should certainly continue

MacmillanSir Norman BrookLord CarringtorKMr. JamesAustraliaMr. MenziesSir Arthur FaddenMr. HoltMr. CaseySir Philip McBrideMr. CramerMr. OsborneMr. TangeMr. HicksSecretary: Mr. E. J. BuntingThe following items were discussed:1.   Antarctica.2.   South-East Asia.1. AntarcticaMr. Macmillan referred to the proposal, which has been under secret discussion between officials in Washington, for an international authority for the wholeAntarctic continent. He explained certain details of the proposal and expressed his own Governments support for it.TOP SECRET53456 K 2to be followed. In conclusion, Mr. Menzies said that he would think itinexpedient to attempt to reduce this to any written formula or to seek general acceptance to it; it would be preferable that the United Kingdom Governmentshould proceed on this basis de facto in putting forward suggestions for Meetings.Mr. Macmillan said that he was interested to hear this expression ofMr. Menzies&apos; views, with which he was in full agreement.5. Commonwealth Economic ConferenceMr. Menzies explained that, for domestic reasons, the Australian Governmentcould not agree that the Commonwealth Economic Conference should be heldin October 1958. At that time they would be putting their Budget through parliament, and the Ministers concerned with financial and economic business would be unable to leave Canberra. From their point of view, therefore, the latestpracticable date for the Conference was 15th September and that on theassumption that it would not last for more than two weeks.Mr. Menzies emphasised the importance of adequate preparation by officials.The United Kingdom authorities seemed to think that the meeting of senior officials,which was to be held in May, could complete its work in a fortnight. He thought this estimate was optimistic. Very difficult issues would be raised; and it was important that senior officials should have enough time to put before the MinisterialConference proposals which had been adequately discussed.6. Visit of Prime Minister of New ZealandMr. Menzies informed Mr. Macmillan that he was proposing to inviteMr. Walter Nash, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, to visit Australia^in the nearfuture, possibly on his way to or from the forthcoming meeting of SEATO.
In particular he said that, if the Russians continued their Antarctic activitiesafter the end of the International Geophysical Year, there would be small prospectof any action to dislodge them from the bases which they had established in theAustralian sector. In the circumstances it seemed better to anticipate thesituation by seeking to establish an international regime, and inviting Russia tojoin in the preparatory talks which would be necessary.The proposal would not require a surrender of sovereignty and would, infact, freeze the sovereignty position as it now is. The United States had originallyfavoured the abandonment of sovereignty claims but had been persuaded by theUnited Kingdom to support the &quot; freeze &quot; arrangement.Mr. Macmillan said that the New Zealand Government had indicated to himits support for this proposal and he would be interested to know the views of theAustralian Government.Mr. Menzies said that the Cabinet had recently had the matter underconsideration and had found difficulty in relation to a few specific points. In thefirst place, it was not clear what territorial claim, if any, Russia might make.Australia, like the United Kingdom, is under the impression that Russia will remainafter the end of the International Geophysical Year. But this did not necessarilymean that Russia would put forward a territorial claim. On the other hand, an invitation to Russia to participate in discussion of an international regime might provoke her into making such a claim.The next point of difficulty for Australia was the universal scope and somewhatvague nature of the proposals. In relation to sovereignty, there seemed to be no real meaning in the &quot; freeze &quot; proposals as control and management of the territory would be in other hands. The Australian Government had thought that it would bebetter to follow an inductive approach, suggesting international co-operation on two or three specific subjects rather than attempting a comprehensive system.He said next that the Australian Government was troubled about whetherdemilitarisation could be guaranteed if, notwithstanding the rules, Russia was not disposed to conform. It seemed possible that it could make military preparationsunder the guise of scientific development, while other countries observed theconvention to the letter. This would be a risk which could certainly not be coveredwithout clear and particular arrangements.At Mr. Menzies&apos; request, Mr. Casey described the Australian Antarcticactivities over a period of years and referred also to the present Russian activity.He expressed the same general doubts as Mr. Menzies about the wisdom of thepresent &quot; total &quot; approach proposals.Mr. Macmillan said that his Governments attitude was based very much onthe practical difficulties of the present situation. The United Kingdom had for along period been in argument with Chile and Argentina about the Falkland IslandDependency, and had found it impracticable either to dislodge their survey partiesor to bring them to arbitration on their claims. He expected that the sameproblems, probably in larger degree, would in time arise through Russian poachingon the Australian sector. It was therefore a matter of deciding the best way of avoiding a situation of difficulty with Russia. It might be possible to wait untilthe end of the International Geophysical Year to see what Russia does. Yet bywaiting the present Antarctic Powers could lose some initiative and perhaps find the matter raised in the United Nations. He wondered also whether lesserinternational action of the sort favoured by Australia was practicable and, in anycase, whether it could be kept limited. On the question of sovereignty, he thoughtthat the claims to territory were at the best shadowy.Mr. Menzies agreed that the claims were vague and not clearly sustainablejuridically. He did not want the area to become one of warring claims. However,claims should not be abandoned in advance, and it might be possible to use themto develop positive co-operation. He said that he would like to see action todevelop a habit of international co-operation in Antarctica on particular positivematters for instance meteorology and geology. He considered that the importantobjective of demilitarisation might be easier to achieve against an establishedbackground of co-operation than if it were pursued straight away as part of the universal and vague proposal now under consideration.Mr. Casey suggested that the international co-operation might best be approached by a more or less permanent extension for scientific purposes of the
International Geophysical Year, with an arrangement also about demilitarisation.Co-operation in scientific matters might be arranged either by countries making their own investigations and pooling results or by a system of co-ordination under some agreed authority.Mr. Macmillan repeated that, even under an extended InternationalGeophysical Year arrangement, the point would probably arise at which theRussians went beyond science into the military field. If so, the prooiem of dealingwith them would still not be avoided. It was, he thought, essentially a matter of practical decision whether to wait for the point of difficulty to arrive or to try to anticipate it.The two Prime Ministers agreed that the discussion had helped to explaineach other&apos;s views, and to identify the issues to be decided. They each agreed tocontinue their consideration of them.2.   South-East AsiaMr. Menzies invited Mr. Macmillan to speak on South-East Asia mattersgenerally.Mr. Macmillan began by referring to SEATO and confirmed the UnitedKingdoirTs support for SEATO as the vital international defence organisation inthe South-East Asia area. He emphasised the fact that the chief strength of theorganisation obviously lay in four Powers United States, United Kingdom,Australia and New Zealand.He referred next to ANZAM and ANZUS and expressed United Kingdomsupport for both organisations. In relation to ANZUS he said that the UnitedKingdom Government freely acknowledged the advantage of the opportunity itgave foK. close discussions with the United States, and therefore regarded it as most valuable.He regarded ANZAM as equally valuable. It was, in particular, the onlyinstrument under present circumstances for dealing with limited war in the area.As things stood, the only military forces developed for this purpose were theANZAM forces. The American forces had a capacity for &quot; major &quot; war but nocapacity for &quot; limited &quot; war. He expressed the view that the United Kingdom,Australia and New Zealand should aim to achieve a combination of ANZAMand ANZUS.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom land forces which it had beendecided in principle to maintain in Malaya and Singapore would consist by 1962of 8 major British units and 7 Gurkha units, with strengths of 11.000 British and13,000 Gurkhas, making a total of 24,000.He confirmed his statement of 29th January that the United Kingdom intendedto maintain a balanced naval force east of Suez of at least the strength recommended in the enclosure to Mr. Sandy&apos;s letter of 27th August, 1957. to Mr. Menzies. this force would be based on Singapore.Referring to Singapore, Mr. Macmillan said that his Government believed itnecessary to prevent Communist control and that the United Kingdom would be willing to assume direct government under its reserve powers. It was probablethat the Singapore dockyard would be maintained for repair work but that theUnited Kingdom would be very much helped by any extra work which it is possibleto give the dockyard.In speaking of Malaya, Mr. Macmillan referred to the dilemma which theUnited Kingdom Government were facing. They had made a defence agreementwith Malaya and would wish to observe the terms of the agreement which providefor the stationing of forces; yet the fact remained that the Malayan Governmentcould, at any time, request the United Kingdom to withdraw its forces. Therequest would undoubtedly apply to other Commonwealth forces as well.Mr. Macmillan thought that the chances were rather that the United kingdom would not be asked to withdraw. The troops would probably be seen in Malayaas a protection first of all against terrorism inside Malaya, but also against externalthreats from any quarter. Evidence of such an attitude was provided by a letter which the Tunku had just sent, expressing apprehension about the effect on Malayaof a further deterioration in the situation in Indonesia. If it were accepted asa matter of policy that United Kingdom, Australian and New Zealand forces shouldstay in Malaya, it would be necessary to go ahead with building the Malacca
112. acantonment. The capital cost of this was estimated at  7-5 millions and theUnited Kingdom hoped that Australia would feel able to contribute towards thiseither by capital or by rent. Mr. Macmillan said that a further reason for proceeding with the Malacca cantonment was the faith it would show in thepresent Malayan Government. Putting it another way he thought that not going ahead would indicate doubts about the Malayan Government which might very well weaken it.Mr. Menzies and Mr. Casey took up the point that, although the Strategic-Reserve was valuable for use against terrorists, this was, in fact, its secondary role,the primary role being SEATO reserve. They considered that, as the emergencyended, and especially if neutralist pressures developed in Malaya, Tengku abdul rahman may not be able to defend the presence of the troops in Malaya indefinitely.Lord Carrington thought that fear of another Indonesian situation may giveRahman a justification, even after the emergency ends.Mr. Macmillan said that it seemed to him to be a clear choice between providingpermanent accommodation for the forces and withdrawing them. It was not practicable to keep troops in temporary make-shift accommodation in peacetime,and therefore as they returned from the jungle they must be given suitable accommodation or withdrawn. He said that he was fully aware of the risk, thatan investment made in building permanent accommodation could be totally lost, buthe thought that, unless the United Kingdom were willing to withdraw from thedefence treaty, there was no real alternative.Mr. Menzies asked whether Mr. Macmillan could indicate his assessment of the chances of Malaya staying on the side of the West. It seemed to him that in newcountries, ultra nationalism and self-interest, as distinct from community interest,are powerful forces. In addition, he expected that Malaya would be under great pressure from some other countries, and especially India, to adopt a neutralist policy.In these circumstances, the chance to keep forces there for any length of time maybe small and, if so, this might well govern what the United Kingdom, Australia andNew Zealand should do on the cantonment question.Mr. Macmillan agreed that there was a risk, but to withdraw from the defencetreaty would probably be the quickest way to push Malaya to neutralism, and hehad strong doubts whether this would be the reasonable thing to do. WhetherMalaya would of its own accord go neutralist depended on how it summed up the external threats to it.  It may decide that neutralism is too great a risk.If, as Mr. Macmillan had believed, Australia wanted the level of UnitedKingdom forces in Malaya to be kept up, the cantonment seemed a necessaryexpenditure, notwithstanding the risk. If Australia would not object to withdrawalof the forces, he could perhaps regard the matter somewhat differently.Sir Philip McBride said that on the Malacca question it had to be realised that,under the Malayan defence agreement, the strategic reserve could be used outsideMalaya only with the consent of the Malayan Government. This was a factor which required consideration. However, he said that the point he wanted to make chieflywas that the United Kingdom had not so far put any firm proposal to Australiaabout Malacca, although the subject had been mentioned on a few occasions. Hethought that such a proposition might be put forward for consideration.Mr. Macmillan said that no proposition had so far been made partly becausethe United Kingdom had been watching the development of the emergency andpartly because it was desired to have some prior discussion with Australia. He said it was quite true about the consent of the Malayan Government being needed in emergency, but he did not despair of the consent being obtained.Mr. Casey said that neither he nor any of the Australian Ministers had wanted to create the impression that Australia was indifferent to British forces remaining in malaya and at strength on the contrary.Mr. Menzies said that the Australian Cabinet would give further considerationto the Malacca issue and would be in a position to give its reactions to Mr: Macmillan at the next meeting on .11th February.Mr. Macmillan said that he should not be taken as having decided finally infavour of building the cantonment at Malacca. The question which he would likethe Australian Government to consider was whether they would be able to help towards it if it were decided to go forward with it.
Mr. Macmillan said that he would arrange for a detailed memorandum to bei submitted as soon as possible covering the United Kingdom Governments*&apos; proposals.I *Record of a Meeting held at Parliament House, Canberra, at 10 30 a.m. on11th February, 1958Present:United kingdom mr.

Construction of Cantonment at Malacca for the CommonwealthStrategic Reserve2. Britavia Ltd.3. Commonwealth Economic Matters4. ImmigrationI 5. Permanent Building SocietiesI hem / -Construction of Cantonment at Malacca for the Commonwealth StrategicReserveMr. Menzies referred to a memorandum by the United Kingdom Government\ concerning the proposal to build a cantonment at Malacca, estimated to costI about  Stg.7-V millions, for the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. He said thatj the Australian Government would be prepared to co-operate in sharing the; capital costs along the lines suggested in paragraph 15 of the memorandum.I Financial details should be finalised by the appropriate officials at an early date.Mr. Macmillan on behalf of the United Kingdom Government expressed1 appreciation for this decision.1; Item 2. Britavia Ltd.Mr. Macmillan referred to an earlier request by the United Kingdom; Government that Britavia Ltd. be granted rights for an all-freight air service between London and Perth. He thought that the minimum conditions which theI Australian Government proposed recently, dealing with frequency of operation,I route to be followed and reciprocity for Qantas, might be somewhat onerous.* Note. The records of the meetings held in Canberra at 10-30 u.m. and 2-45 p.m.on 11th February were prepared by the Australian Cabinet Secretariat: it was not possible forthese to be agreed with the United Kingdom representatives before their departure the same evening.
Nevertheless, Britavia Ltd. were anxious to undertake the service and he suggestedthat, as a first step, Britavia Ltd. be permitted to have exploratory discussions with Qantas to determine whether some partnership arrangement for this serviceand in terms of the conditions proposed, might be possible. He said that theUnited Kingdom Government encouraged the development of these smallerairlines since they could be regarded as an additional source of troop-carrying capacity for use in emergency.Mr. Menzies agreed that Britavia Ltd. should commence discussions withQantas along these lines.Item 3. Commonwealth Economic MattersMr. Menzies spoke of the forthcoming Commonwealth Trade and EconomicConference and the need to know what it was we were seeking in the Conference.He detected some absence of clarity as to the ends we should be working for. It was important to both the United Kingdom and to Australia to isolate and concentrate on the few topics which were regarded as the nub of the matter. The preparatorymeeting in May needed special care to ensure the success of the conference. Ifwe found ourselves in September debating a large variety of different subjects,the conference was either going to take a very long time or it would be scamped.We should therefore concentrate our efforts on a few worthwhile subjects.Mr. Menzies also spoke of the importance to Australia of the EuropeanCommon Market and the Free Trade Area proposals. Australia was extremelyconscious of their importance and urgency to the United Kingdom. Australiaalso recognised that, if the United Kingdom suffered, she would also suffer. TheAustralian Government would like to know how the negotiations were going, andparticularly what were the prospects for a Free Trade Area which would not undulyimpinge on the markets for primary products which were so important to Australia.Finally. Mr. Menzies expressed the hope that there could be some frank talk about sterling. The Australian Government knew and appreciated the valiantstruggle being made by the United Kingdom. Australia herself had taken measuresto order her external trade so as to contribute to the needs of the sterling area, butthere was still some drain of sterling area reserves. The Australian Governmentwould be interested to know what were the real prospects :xthe spectacular resultsof the bank rate adjustment have been noticed, but the Australian Governmenthas wondered whether these would be of long or short duration. Eventually therewould have to be found some alternative to a policy of continuing restriction.Mr. McEwen emphasised that the Australian Government had always beenconscious of the political need to increase the economic strength and cohesion ofEurope. They understood that the United Kingdom could not stand aside fromthis and therefore supported the proposals for a Free Trade Area in manufacturedgoods, but were concerned about the effects on Australia^ primary products. Theyappreciated the unwavering stand by the United Kingdom Government in resistingthe inclusion of agricultural products, in the interests of the Commonwealthproducers, but were bound to express some doubts as to whether this attitudecould, in the long run, be maintained.Australians export interests were not determined by tariffs alone. agricultural commodities were subject to a variety of trading devices and controls, and if theUnited Kingdom was drawn into arrangements which, while maintaining tariffsuntouched, involved other protective devices, it would be a matter of considerableconcern to the Australian Government. They would like to get inside UnitedKingdom minds on this matter.&apos; Mr. McEwen also referred to world commodity trends and the fact that the values of the bulk commodities had got out of line with the values of industrialproducts. This was particularly so in the case of metals and foodstuffs. As aninstance of the significance of this, it has been claimed that all of the special aid to India at the present time was more than offset by the fall in value of her exportcommodities. This could have a serious impact on the political stability of someof these countries, with consequences for the Commonwealth as a whole.Mr. Macmillan recalled the origins of the proposal for a commonwealth economic Conference and mentioned Canada&apos;s desire to draw closer in trade to
the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, and to reduce herdependence on the United States. He believed that the Conference could havevaluable results. As he saw it, the Canadian Economy was out of order and had only been kept in balance by heavy United States investment. There was a feeling in Canada that the temporary advantages of this investment could become a longterm disadvantage, and it was a fact that even a relatively small reduction in thescale of United States investment could have serious effects in Canada.As to the conference, Mr. Macmillan recognised the need for adequatepreparation and therefore agreed that the preliminary talks in London might haveto be longer than already planned. It would be better to concentrate on a fewpractical proposals which were likely to produce useful results. He knew thatthe United Kingdom officials were conscious of the need for practical preparations,but on his return to London he would do what he could to ensure that these weremade.Turning to sterling, Mr. Macmillan said one must not be defeatist but heconfessed to some concern about the financial strength of the non-Communistworld. The United States, for example, had never accepted the responsibilities ofa creditor nation. In the 19th century, when the United Kingdom was in that position, it adopted policies of free trade, and large scale overseas investment.Many of the present variety of devices for aid would be unnecessary if the UnitedStates opened their markets to the world instead of imposing restraints wheneversome difficulty arose.Nevertheless, the American attitude was one of the present day facts of life,and it was largely true that by unscientific methods the dollar gap had been moreor less bridged since the war. However, there was always the danger of theUnited States taking more dollars out than were being put into the system andthere were signs of a dangerous re-opening of the dollar gap.The German situation was, however, a much more dangerous one. western germany had attracted some 10 million workers since the war. Its interest structuredid not reflect the true financial position of the Federation. There was no Germancapital market for outside investment and as a result there was a large-scaleimmobilisation of credit with consequent deflationary effects, most dangerous tothe world. Germany, because of her history, was more afraid of inflation than ofunemployment, and he thought that the United States was more likely to bridge the dollar gap than was West Germany to overcome these defects in monetary policy.In reply to Sir Arthur Fadden, Mr. Macmillan said that he thought that therecent small reduction in German interest rate structure had done no more thancorrect some speculative tendencies. He did not think it had contributed to anycorrection of the fundamental monetary problem. He was frightened of the implications of the capital immobilisation, and Germany must somehow be broughtto understand the true nature of the problem.As far as the United Kingdoirfs own position was concerned, there was atthe present time a reasonably good inflow, and some surplus on current accountwas expected for 1957-58. The Government would, however, continue to pursuefirm policies, and he was confident that this year would be a successful one.There were some difficulties in the rest of the sterling area. As banker, theUnited Kingdom never knew with any assurance whether the money was going tocome in or go out. They had had to manage the big run down of Indian balances.There were continual problems but it was no answer to suggest that the UnitedKingdom should cease to be the banker for the sterling area.The United Kingdom would continue to do the best it could and to attractcapital wherever possible, but ultimately success depended on German and UnitedStates policies. There was a need for a high level agreement on monetary policiesbetween the major financial groupings. It was important that it be understood thatthe political problems of the free world could not be divorced from economic and monetary factors. This was a point which he might take up on his next visit tothe United States.On the Free Trade Area proposals, it was difficult to know what would happen in the long run. The United Kingdom was concerned over the appearance of strong forces in some places to bring the European Common Market into being,but to strive for the Free Trade Area to fail. Mr. Maudling, who was in chargeof the&quot; negotiations, was meeting High Commissioners regularly, and sendingmessages on developments. The United Kingdom would also work with Australia
in the GATT in watching the Common Market proposals. Whilst Free Trade Areadevelopments had been slower than expected, Mr. Maudling hoped they would come to a head by May.Mr. Macmillan emphasised that it was not the intention of the United kingdom to make agricultural concessions. He recognised that they might fail in this. If so,it could be because of a desire on the part of the Six to frustrate the formation of a free Trade Area, making the agricultural concessions the excuse. He was sure that none of the Six were themselves prepared to give up their own agriculturalprotection. He fully recognised the need for continuing in closest consultation with australia and other Commonwealth countries.Mr. Menzies commented that he could not understand why the French shouldnot be concerned to see the United Kingdom economy as powerful as possible.The United Kingdom and not Germany had been France\s protector in the past.Mr. Macinilian mentioned that there appeared to be a pessimistic outlook inFrance and some lack of confidence in their own nationhood. This was reflected in their apparent anxiety to huddle into supra-national organisations for addedprotection.Mr. Menzies emphasised the need for the most effective consultation on theFree Trade Area proposals. Australia and the United Kingdom must know whatwas in each other&apos;s mind. It was common in these matters to find after a lengthypause that some quick decision was needed. It would strengthen the UnitedKingdom&apos;s hand to know intimately Australian attitudes. There must be a closeunderstanding of possibilities and ability to take quick decisions. Australia could most effectively deal with issues as they arose if she saw them in the perspectiveof the negotiations as a whole.Mr. Macmillan said that United Kingdom had tried to achieve this; he recognised the importance of the point and the need to tighten communications.He would have a special look at procedures again when he returned to London.Mr. Menzies said he saw the whole operation as being much more than a tradenegotiation. The political and military implications were paramount. A wsakenedUnited Kingdom economy would weaken the defence of Europe.Mr. Menzies asked, with regard to the American financial attitudes, what pointthere was in members of the sterling area discussing sterling policy when UnitedStates policy fluctuated with the emotions of the moment. They had to learn to live as a creditor nation, and it was essential that the sterling area devise someeffective instruments of communication to ensure that the United States policymakers understood the various inter-actions.Mr. McMahon suggested that one way of overcoming the problem ofcommunication could be through the parliamentary approach, with parliamentarydelegations seeking to &quot; indoctrinate &quot; the Congress.Mr. Menzies said that the lead, and it must be a powerful one, had to comefrom the Executive. Congress did not initiate policy. As he saw it, Mr. Macmillanand others had to &quot; talk turkey &quot; to the President, so that he in turn would givethe necessary lead.Mr. McEwen spoke of the need both to &quot; ginger&quot; and assist the state department. He mentioned also that he had sometimes detected a willingness onthe part of countries like Pakistan and Ceylon to talk more freely to Australia thanperhaps to the United Kingdom. Australia was coming to have a special statusfor these countries and in international organisations such as GATT. he mentioned this as a point which was perhaps significant to both the political andeconomic situation.Item 4. ImmigrationMr. Townley spoke of some immigration matters which he hopedMr. Macmillan would have an opportunity to examine.The first concerned immigration of children from the United Kingdom. Therewere at the present time vacancies for 1,000 children in various institutions such asFairbridge Farms and Presbyterian homes. Australia regarded these childrenas among the most important immigrants.
I \ -2.zyx\/Item 5. Permanent Building SocietiesAs a supplement to Mr. Townley&apos;s reference to the British building societies,Senator Spooner hoped Mr. Macmillan would consider the possibility of amendingUnited Kingdom legislation so as to permit permanent building societies to investsome of their funds in Australia for home-building purposes.The permanent building society movement was well established in the UnitedKingdom but not so well known in Australia. The Commonwealth Government,and he expected the State Governments also, would be prepared to make some government moneys available for these societies and it would encourage the growth of the societies in Australia if the British societies were permitted to make somemodest capital investments.Mr. Macmillan undertook to examine the request. He knew intimately thegood work the societies had done in the United Kingdom. At the same time he pointed out that their capital was not of the ordinary kind but rather of the PostOffice savings type, and there was therefore an obligation on the Government tomaintain a close control of their activities.The second matter concerned availability of finance from the United Kingdombuilding societies. Under a United Kingdom Act of 1874 there was a prohibition on outside investment by the societies. Some United Kingdom migrants had expressed the hope that they could draw on these societies to build themselveshomes. It might be possible to amend the Act to allow the British societies to finance home building for British migrants in Australia.The third question was that of United Kingdom membership of theIntergovernmental Committee for European Migration (I.C.E.M.). Australia stillhoped that the United Kingdom might find it possible to accept membership.Mr. Holt referred to a report which had recommended, for strategic reasons,consideration of an organised movement of United Kingdom people out of theUnited Kingdom to Commonwealth countries. Whilst he recognised theimpracticabilities of such large-scale movement in peacetime, he wondered whetherthe United Kingdom had given top-level consideration to the possibility of some kind of organised migration. There was a danger to the Commonwealth in the concentration of so much of British resources in one small vulnerable area.Mr. Holt also suggested that there could be considerable advantage inencouragement of further British migration to East and Central Africa. Whilstthese areas were still largely under British influence, that influence would inevitablydisappear unless there was a conscious building up of the British component of thepopulation.Finally, Mr. Holt suggested there was scope for a practical gesture by theUnited Kingdom to facilitate the migration of retrenched servicemen. There werenot great numbers of them, but generally they were good types and they would contribute to maintenance of a true cross section of the United Kingdom population in the immigration programme.Mr. Macmillan undertook to look further into these matters.

Irish CredentialsMr. Macmillan referred to the earlier discussions with Mr. Menzies. He saidthat his Government had now examined the compromise solution under discussion between Australia and Ireland and had reached the view that it appeared to be suitable and might possibly form a basis for more general application. he emphasised that his understanding on two aspects of the proposal was as follows:  (a) that in the formal description of Her Majesty in the letters of credence,the words Queen of &quot; the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland&quot; will be included;(b) that there would be an exchange of letters to be made public to the effectthat the letters of credence are without prejudice to the territorial issue.Mr. Menzies confirmed that these understandings were correct. He notedthe United Kingdom Government^ acceptance of the proposal.2. South-East AsiaMr. Menzies invited Mr. Macmillan to open the discussion.Mr. Macmillan said that he would like to begin by again making it plain thatthe United Kingdom had no reservations about support for the existence ofANZUS. It was essential to keep co-operation with the United States in this area running and the closer Australia and New Zealand could get to America forthis purpose the better.About ANZAM, Mr. Macmillan said that he detected some impression on thepart of the United States that ANZAM was some sort of survival of colonialism.He believed, however, that the real need was for the four countries which coulddeploy effective defence forces in the area (viz., the United States, Australia, NewZealand and the United Kingdom) to undertake some joint consideration of defenceRecord of a Meeting held at Parliament House, Canberra, at 2-45 p.m. on11th February, 1958Present:United kingdom mr. Macmillan.Sir Norman BrookLord CarringtonMr. JamesAustraliaMr. MenziesMr. McEwenMr. CaseySir Philip McBrideSecretary: Mr. BuntingThe following items were discussed:
Bpolicy for South-East Asia. He believed that this could be done unobtrusively, perhaps in Washington, without upsetting the other SEATO Powers. He thought$that his own relations with the President of the United States were such that hefcould make this suggestion to him.Mr. Menzies referred to the lack of result from earlier approaches to the^United States on the subject of four-Power planning. We had not so far succeededI in getting into the American mind. Nevertheless he supported the idea of a new-attempt, and believed that Mr. Macmillan may well be able to use his present- relationship with the United States to get closer to its thoughts. He recalled that following discussions with Sir Winston Churchill in 1955, he had himself made an approach to the United States, and because of this, expressed the view that itwould be inappropriate for Australia to make another approach or even to join; in Mr. Macmillan&apos;s approach. He said that Mr. Macmillan should make it clear: that the consultations being sought would be on a private basis otherwise perhaps the United States and certainly the Asian SEATO countries would react.Sir Philip McBricie referred to possible changes in the American attitude&apos; towards putting other countries in the picture on defence planning. In recent^months the signs had been better, including as recently as last week when officers.&apos;from Admiral Stump&apos;s headquarters visited Australia for discussions oni Indonesia.Mr. Casey also referred to earlier four-Power planning proposals and to theAmerican attitude expressed in ANZUS Council meetings that four-Powerplanning led them into trouble with the Asian SEATO countries. They acceptedpublicly the idea of eight-Power planning in SEATO-which of course was notrealistic and they had indicated that they did not rule out bilateral planningdiscussions. But so far they had not responded to anything in between. He agreed with Mr. Menzies that it was appropriate and right for Mr. Macmillan to approachI the United States again. He suggested that it might be wise to avoid the word&quot; planning.&quot;  It tended to alert the Pentagon to immediate opposition.   A word1 like &quot; consultation &quot; or &quot; discussion &quot; would be more tactful.Mr. Menzies continued by saying that Australia was in no position to direct: its defence plans with the highest degree of intelligence unless it had access toI American and British plans for the area. His Government had always desired andI still desired to develop a means of access.Mr. Macmillan said that in view of the background of earlier four-power planning proposals, it might be as well to make the first approach bilateral only.This he could do personally, approaching the United States on the lines that theI United Kingdom could not make sense of its own plans without knowing theI general shape of American plans: that this did not need to involve constant poringI over details: and that it was a question of outline being available so thai:I co-operation could be developed and duplication avoided.Therefore, if Australia agreed, he would make it his objective to speak\ to Mr. Eisenhower at a suitable opportunity, to start the matter off bilaterally and! to work towards bringing Australia and New Zealand into the arrangements.I Meanwhile he took it that, pending reactions to his approach, ANZAM should continue in its present role.Mr. Menzies said that these proposals would be acceptable to the AustralianI Government. No offence would be taken at bilateral discussions by the United\ Kingdom, as Australia was in a position of the closest co-operation with the Unitedjj Kingdom and would prefer to rely on that relationship rather than put the wholeI exercise at risk if the United States found it practicable to deal with UnitedI Kingdom but not with any wider group.I 3.   IndonesiaMr. Menzies invited Mr. Casey to outline the position as the AustralianI Government saw it. Mr. Casey referred to President Soekarno&apos;s &quot; guideddemocracy &quot; concept, mentioning his invitation to a number of Communists to join the Indonesian National Council, and his general sympathy and encouragement of the Communist Party of Indonesia. He referred briefly to the gap opened upbetween the Central Government and the dissidents in Sumatra, the Celebes andother islands other than Java, leading to the separatist movement by the Sumatrandissidents and their call on Dr. Djuanda to resign.
The Sumatran dissidents were representative of some of the best army and civil elements in Indonesia and if they were to succeed in replacing the present government, it would be about as moderate and middle-of-the-road an administration as we could expect from Indonesia. However, the capacity of theSumatran dissidents to make any impact outside Sumatra had to be doubted. Ifthey were to become in practice a dissident Government of Sumatra and no more,it would be regarded by Australia as an unfortunate development because itmight well leave Java, and possibly the rest of Indonesia, to Communism. a third alternative was that the movement might lead to civil war.It appeared that a great deal would depend on Soekarno&apos;s attitude and reactionson his return in the near future to Djakarta from his Middle East and Asian tour.The signs were that the assassination attempt had an effect on Soekarno and therewas some chance that he might be more tractable.Nevertheless, the Sumatra movement was the only movement in sight whichoffered any promise of an alternative to the otherwise almost inevitable drifttowards Communism and as such, it seemed desirable to Australia that it shouldbe discreetly supported.The events in Indonesia had had their effect on the mind of Tengku abdul rahman. His reactions indicated that he realised that the Communist threat to malaya did not come from the Communist terrorists in the Malayan jungle only.This incident might well have its effect on Malaya&apos;s attitude to the stationing oftroops in Malaya.Mr. Casey said that there seemed to be no doubt that Dutch nationals^were leaving Indonesia for good. There would as a consequence be wide economicgaps with adverse effect on the Indonesian economy. There was no reason to expect any early economic regeneration in Indonesia.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government held similar views to those expressed by Mr. Casey. It agreed that the risk arising from the dissidentmovement in Sumatra was that a sort of Vichy would be set up. Much the bettersolution, if it could be got, would be for terms to be reached between the dissidentsand a suitably constituted Government in Djakarta which, of course, was whatthe dissidents were seeking. It would be a mistake to foster a permanent division in Indonesia so long as there was any chance of saving Java and the rest ofIndonesia from Communism.Mr. Macmillan mentioned Tengku Abdul Rahman&apos;s letter and expressed theview that he should be given a forthcoming reply.Mr. Casey suggested that it would be helpful if Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, Mr. Nashand he could meet for a day or so in Kuala Lumpur on the way to the SEATOCouncil meeting and perhaps have some discussions with the Tengku.4.   South-East Asia Information ServicesMr. Macmillan said that in recent discussions with the United StatesGovernment the possibility had been mentioned of increasing the impact of theWest on South-East Asia generally by means of information services. This wasa field of activity in which Australia was already taking a considerable part.He thought that tripartite talks between United States, United Kingdom and australia were desirable and suggested that they might be held in Canberra. Theconference would be concerned not so much with the content, as with operationalmethods and equipment.  Mr. Menzies and Mr. Casey welcomed this proposal.5.   Replacement of Dutch in IndonesiaMr. Macmillan said that the Dutch Government had spoken to the UnitedKingdom about the vacuum in Indonesia due to the Dutch withdrawal and had offered the view that to preserve Western influence as much as possible, western countries should not be diffident about replacing the Dutch with their own nationalsor organisations. The Dutch would certainly not take it amiss if action to thisend were taken by Western countries, though they would like to be kept informed and would, of course, reserve their compensation claims.Mr. Casey indicated that similar views had recently been received by australia from the Dutch. Mr. Menzies said that the Australian Government hadbeen exercised by this point, especially over airlines, and that the Dutch attitude was helpful.
6. SingaporeMr. Casey referred to the possibility that Lim Yew Hock would be beatenin the Singapore elections and to the statement bv Mr. Macmillan to AustralianMinisters on an earlier occasion that if Lim Yew Hock were beaten and a Left-I wing and intransigent P.A.P. Government were to come into power, the UnitedKingdom would back pedal on the constitutional arrangements. He appreciated that in the end such a step might have to be taken to preserve Singapore, buthe wondered whether in the circumstances the best thing would not be to movej Lim to postpone the elections. In any case he hoped that no further concessions in constitutional matters would be given to Singapore.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom attitude was that Singaporecould not be abandoned.   The best thing would be for Lim, or a successor whowas willing to adopt reasonable policies, to continue in authority.  But if mattersdeveloped otherwise, the United Kingdom believed it had to act by using its powers to suspend the Constitution.  It beiieved that physical control of Singaporecould be maintained.   Singapore was much less difficult in the physical sensethan Cyprus, for instance.   He knew that the understanding of the United states in any such exercise would be important, and he would therefore hope (andexpect) to obtain it.   The United States would certainly not want Singapore; abandoned.   If it appeared that Lim could win the election, it might be as well\ to give it a go.  If not, postponement might be best.  But if necessary, the reservepower would be used.  Mr. Casey suggested that at the proper moment it wouldbe useful to prepare the ground in advance with, the United States in case thereserve power had to be used.Mr. Macmillan added that the people of Singapore would want Singaporelinked with Malaya but it was clear that Rahman was not likely to accept any such arrangement.Sir Philip McBride questioned whether it would be wise from a political point of view to suspend the Constitution immediately upon the emergence ofa new leader who had won his position through the ballot box.Mr. Macmillan said that it would not be done straight away upon election.\ It would depend on how the new man behaved. There was probably no need to fear the worst. There were good signs as well as bad in Singapore and there might be no requirement to suspend the Constitution. If the new leader behavedbadly, he would, so to speak, bring suspension on his own head and the politicaljustification would be much less difficult.I7. Support for SEATOMr. Casey referred to the forthcoming SEATO Council meeting and thevaluevof public expressions of support for SEATO, and of conviction of itsusefulness.Mr. Macmillan agreed with these views.8. Colombo PlanMr. Casey referred to the advantages of securing the participation of one or) more European countries and especially West Germany in the Colombo Plan.He wondered whether Mr. Macmillan would be willing to raise the issue withdraw. Adenauer. He felt that he should anticipate the argument (which is oftenraised) that Colombo Plan membership might give Western Germany new tradeopportunities, because these were minor considerations at the most and of nosignificance against the advantages of West Germany support.IMr. Macmillan expressed some interest in this possibility and undertook tohave it examined.9. France and SEATOMr. Casey referred to his impression that under present conditions france was not very much more than a nominal member of the alliance.  Its interest was confined almost exclusively to the cultural aspect.Mr. Macmillan noted this view.
10. Supply in WartimeMr. Macmillan referred to the probability that in conditions of nuclear war there would be no chance for any country to receive a build-up of stores overiong supply routes.  It would be a case of &quot; lighting with what you have got.&quot;Mr. Menzies said that he accepted this as a fact of life. In nuclear war,the United Kingdom would be in the middle of it. And, in view of the I.C.B.M,the United States likewise.11. DisarmamentMr. Macmillan said that he felt convinced that Russia did not want war.At the same time, its present propaganda and political efforts towards outlawingnuclear war were based at least partly on the hope that it might be left in a positionof superior strength in the conventional field which it was building up, especially on the naval side. xMr. Menzies said that he shared this view. He thought, in addition, thatWestern peoples had tended to be deluded by Russian propaganda and that it was an important exercise to see that they had a full understanding of the significance of conventional arms capacities as well as nuclear.12. Recognition of Communist ChinaMr. Casey referred to the longer term issues of this subject.  The time would eventually come when the subject had to be discussed and he thought that plans,for dealing with the matter might usefully be made ahead of time.  One possibility&quot;was that continental China with Peking as capital would be recognised separately from Formosa.It would be useful to do some thinking in advance of the event, directed;towards the maintenance of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Government on Formosa. It was,of course, not certain that Peking would accept recognition on the basis of continental China alone, but this might be the only basis on which the majority oficountries would consider recognition.Mr. Macmillan noted these views but made the comment that the United;States was still firmly against any action on the recognition issue.Mr. Menzies said that the point was raised as one for the future.13. Aid to CeylonMr. Casey referred to the approach which the Governor-General of Ceylon^had made to various countries for very large assistance for &quot; reconstruction.&quot; The]approach seemed to be rather synthetically tacked on the recent flood appealwhich Ceylon had made.Mr. Casey added that in the Australian view great caution should be exercised^about assistance to anything like the amount requested. For one thing, Ceylon&apos;sliving standard was already much higher than the general South and South-East-Asia run, and in addition, the appeal bore the same exaggerated marks as the-appeal made by Ceylon at the Finance Ministers&apos; Conference in Australia in 1954.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom had given some assistance to&apos;meet immediate needs. As regards long-term reconstruction they had taken the]line that Ceylon&apos;s first step was to assess the damage and work out a practical)programme of reconstruction. They had offered to provide technical assistance&quot;;to help in this task of evaluation. The financing of the programme could not;usefully be considered at this stage. IMr. Menzies and Mr. Macmillan discussed the form of answer they should givesto any question at their joint Press conference later that day on the use of nuclear&apos;weapons by British Commonwealth forces in South-East Asia. They agreed that;their answers should as much as possible be on the line &quot; We have not discussed any;such arrangement.&quot;14. Nuclear Weapons
Mr. Casey referred to the disadvantage which Australia was under in trying tcform a political judgment including as to the effect in Asia, about the possiblepossession of nuclear weapons by Australia. Insufficient practical knowledge was available in Australia about the weapon, in all its variety of forms and sizes, forany such judgment to be reached. He wondered, therefore, whether some means could be found for suitable Australian officers to be put in possession of the facts of life about nuclear weapons.Sir Philip McBride mentioned that the Australian Services felt the same lack.Among other things, they needed to know what organisational and other changes the use of nuclear weapons would involve.Mr. Menzies said that he could not feel that Australia was yet at a stage wherequestions about the use of nuclear weapons, whether strategic or tactical, could properly be discussed. The United Kingdom was only at the beginning of its development of the weapons. The American cupboard was not yet open. Thepossibility of supply did not therefore exist, and the matter for Australia wastherefore largely academic.Mr. Macmillan said that, like Mr. Menzies, he felt that this would be the wrongtime to set about enquiry. The whole position was very delicate. The McMahonAct amendment was too valuable to put at risk. He recalled his earlier discussionwith Mr. Menzies and other Ministers on this point. The only policy was to keepourselves quiet and let the Americans try to pilot the amendment through Congress without complication from outside. If the amendment got through, it might bepossible to see how the matter looked then.Sir Philip McBride said that he accepted the validity of this view.Mr. Macmillan subsequently indicated that he saw no objection to an examination between the two air forces of the technical facilities side of usingnuclear weapons in South-East Asian area, and he would consider promoting such discussions on his return to the United Kingdom.The meeting concluded at 4 p.m.V
r    113Appendix CDESPATCHES FROM UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONERSINDIAA ding United Kingdom High Commissioner in India to Secretary of State for commonwealth relations my Lord, New Delhi, 17th January, 195SI have the honour to report that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,the Right Hon. Harold Macmillan, accompanied by Lady Dorothy Macmillan,visited India from the 8th January to the 12th January, 1958, at the start of a commonwealth tour which includes visits to four other independent members ofthe Commonwealth besides India.2. Before the departure of the Prime Minister on this tour, Press commentin India was friendly but cautious and in some cases almost routine, for Delhisees a succession of visiting Heads of State and Prime Ministers during thewinter months. It was, however, thought significant that contact between commonwealth Prime Ministers was no longer being made solely through visits to London. The Prime Ministers tour was seen as an imaginative recognitionof the spirit of the expanding Commonwealth and Indians were pleased and rather flattered that India was to be the Prime Minister^ first stop. On the eveof Mr. Macmillan&apos;s arrival there was a noticeable quickening of interest. To someextent this was due to the welcome given in India to his broadcast reference tothe possibility of a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, but there was alsoa strong feeling beginning to emerge that this visit really was a special occasion.3. The Government of India for its part went to great pains over thearrangements and the programme, and Mr. Nehru personally concerned himself with many matters of detail. As a result little was left to chance in the efficient administration of the visit or in the assurance of the personal comfort of thePrime Minister^ party.4. The Britannia carrying the Prime Minister and his party touched down at Palam airport precisely at the scheduled time of 12-45 p.m. on Wednesday,the 8th January. As the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan steppedfrom the plane they were warmly greeted by Mr. Nehru and Mrs. Indira gandhi and leading Indian Cabinet Ministers. After the playing of the national anthemsof the United Kingdom and India the Prime Minister inspected a guard of honourdrawn from the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force and met members of the diplomatic corps. The Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan then turned to acknowledge the welcome of the United Kingdom citizens of Delhi, who werepresent in force, and a crowd of about 2,000 Indians who had gathered at the airport for the occasion. There could be no doubt of the spontaneous goodwillwhich characterised their greeting and the whole occasion became invested withan informal friendliness which set the tone of the whole visit.5. Mr. Nehrifs welcome at the airport struck a happy note. He spoke ofthe &quot; rather unique &quot; relationship between India and Britain in the distant past,near past and present. Any Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he said,would be welcomed in India at any time; Mr. Macmillan was the first british prime Minister in office ever to visit India and his visit was therefore a &quot; doublepleasure.&quot; In his reply the Prime Minister said that Mr. Nehru&apos;s words wouldtouch every British heart. He was greatly looking forward to meeting the Presidentof India and other leading men and women and to hearing their views on manysubjects, particularly the problem of preserving peace throughout the world. ThePrime Minister said that he and his wife were particularly glad to see Mr. Nehruagain. Mr. Nehru was recognised throughout the world as one of the greatpersonalities of the day and it was always a stimulating and rewarding experience to talk with him. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the connection between the two countries had been long and he hoped that as the years wentby it would become even closer and happier.
6. The Prime Minister and Mr. Nehru then drove to Mr. Nehnfs housethrough New Delhi in an open car, Lady Dorothy and Mrs. Gandhi and the restof the Prime Ministers party following in other cars in procession. There was adramatic and historic element about the drive of the two Prime Ministers throughthe magnificent legacy of buildings, parks and monuments that Britain has leftto India, and the significance of the occasion was not lost on the crowds who linedthe streets. The warmth of the Indian people&apos;s welcome to Mr. Macmillan wasunmistakable and a senior Indian official who accompanied the Prime Ministersparty on the drive said that he had not seen so much applause on any earlieroccasion.7. The Prime Minister spent the rest of the 8th January at Mr. Nehnfshouse and in private discussion with Mr. Nehru. Mr. Nehru had invited thePrime Minister to stay with him especially to permit such informal talks, which,of course, were a most important part of the visit. Records of these discussions are not yet available and this despatch is, therefore, confined to describing themore public and general aspects of the visit. But I have already been informed by senior officials, close to Mr. Nehru, that he has not only expressed great pleasureover the success of the visit, but has also made clear that these personal talks had greatly enhanced his understanding of the underlying motives and purposes ofBritish policy.8. On the morning of Thursday, the 9th January, the Prime Minister and lady Dorothy Macmillan paid a visit to the shrine of Mahatma Gandhi and madea quick tour of Old and New Delhi, during which they saw or visited many ofthe city&apos;s historic monuments, including those associated with the Moghulemperors and the siege of Delhi in 1857. On this occasion the streets were againlined with people anxious to assure the Prime Minister of a cordial welcome.Later in the morning the Prime Minister met Pandit Pant, the Indian Minister ofHome Affairs, and Mr. Morarji Desai, the Minister of Commerce and Industry.Luncheon at Mr. Nehrifs house included President Sukarno, of Indonesia, andhis Foreign Minister, Dr. Subandrio. This was a purely social occasion belatedlyarranged. After lunch Dr. Sukarno had a few minutes&apos; conversation withMr. Macmillan, reports of which have been forwarded separately. But, if he had intended to engage the Prime Minister in a long political conversation, Dr. Sukarnodid not succeed.9. On Thursday afternoon the Prime Minister saw something of rural India,and of the fruits of India&apos;s development planning, when he visited two villagesin the Delhi area the village of Jharsa, hardly touched by progress andrepresenting old India, and the model village of Shamaspur, illustrating the aims of the Indian Governments community development programme. Shamaspuris an impressive example, designed to be copied elsewhere, of the work of ruraluplift that can be done when finance is available. Flere the Prime Ministerinspected the neat brick houses of the villagers, their crops and their animals, theschoolrooms and the community centre, and he saw a wrestling match and a shortdisplay of Indian dancing. The Prime Ministers welcome in this country districtwas overwhelming. Fifteen thousand peasants flocked into Jharsa and Shamaspurfrom the surrounding villages on foot, on cycles and in trucks, their numbers werefar greater than the Indian authorities expected and they surged around the PrimeMinister in an affectionate and cheerful throng, delighted with his interest and enquiries into their activities and with the informality of his conversations withthe farmers, craftsmen and veteran soldiers of the old Indian Army, who were brought forward to meet him. It was a memorable afternoon and, before he left,the Prime Minister declared that it was an occasion that he could never forget.10. During this afternoon, Lady Dorothy came to tea with my wife, to meetthe wives of the representatives of the British business community in India whohad been specially invited for the occasion to Delhi (from Calcutta, Bombay,Madras, Kerala and Kanpur) and the wives of senior United Kingdom officials and citizens in Delhi. These ladies, some of whom had come long distances to be present, were most appreciative that Lady Dorothy devoted this afternoon to meeting them.11. In the evening the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillanattended a reception given by the High Commissioner to meet United kingdom citizens. Of their own volition, Mr. Nehru and Mrs. Indira Gandhi paid a surprisevisit to this reception and their gesture was greatly welcomed.   Later the Prime

The Prime Minister and Mr. Nehru then drove to Mr. Nehru&apos;s housethrough New Deihi in an open car, Lady Dorothy and Mrs. Gandhi and the restof the Prime Minister^ party following in other cars in procession. There was adramatic and historic element about the drive of the two Prime Ministers throughthe magnificent legacy of buildings, parks and monuments that Britain has leftto India, and the significance of the occasion was not lost on the crowds who linedthe streets. The warmth of the Indian peopled welcome to Mr. Macmillan wasunmistakable and a senior Indian official who accompanied the Prime Ministersparty on the drive said that he had not seen so much applause on any earlieroccasion.7.

Of their own volition, Mr. Nehru and Mrs. Indira Gandhi paid a surprisevisit to this reception and their gesture was greatly welcomed.   Later the Prime
Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan attended a banquet given by Mr. Nehruin their honour and with great ceremony at the Presidents House amid all itshistoric significance.12. In his speech at this banquet Mr. Nehru said that the British had left a basic impress on India in institutions, language, literature and other ways, whichhad survived even the radical change of relationship. The chief thing about this change had been the manner in which it had been brought about. The spirit of conflict had come to an end and in its place came a desire to co-operate. It was a pattern from which others might profit. Mr. Nehru also spoke of the warmreception which had been given in India, and in Asia, to Mr. Macmillan&apos;suggestion of a non-aggression pact between the great world Powers. In his replyMr. Macmillan said that it was a momentous event in world history that whenthe time came for independent India to choose her own institutions, she chose,not only to maintain many of the traditions in the administration of governmentand justice that India and Britain shared to-day, but also freely to associate with britain on terms of complete equality and unfettered liberty of action in theCommonwealth of Nations. It was this historic decision which had given theCommonwealth its present character of a family group of nations of many races and the growth and development of the Commonwealth on these lines could nothave taken place without the lead given by India. Both Britain and India hadvitally important and challenging tasks lying before them in this vigorous and growing Commonwealth; the future of the Commonwealth and its influence for good in the world depended very largely &quot; not on what we as members can get out of it, but on what we are able to put into it.&quot; The Prime Minister concluded by saying that he looked forward to long and continuing friendship between Indiaand Britain, which he hoped would not only bring comfort and advantage to both,but which would make the Commonwealth an ever stronger force for peace.13. On Friday, the 10th January, the Prime Minister received the IndianMinisters of Finance and Defence for informal discussions and visited All-IndiaRadio to record a speech to be broadcast later in the day. In his broadcast thePrime Minister praised India&apos;s &quot; dynamic social and economic progress &quot; which,he said, &quot; fully justifies her great and growing influence in international affairs.&quot;He dwelt on the great changes which the world had seen in the ten years sinceIndia had become an independent member of the Commonwealth and emphasised the unchanging fundamental principles by which both India and Britain wereguided the freedom of the individual and the system of Parliamentary democracy.The Prime Minister said that in the modern world the idea of national isolationwas out of date. Both India and Britain were members of important organisations for international co-operation the Commonwealth and the United Nations &quot; and we believe that both of these organisations are forces for good in the world.&quot;The Prime Minister then referred to the welcome given in India and Britain to the emergence of Ghana and Malaya as independent members of the commonwealth and described the Commonwealth as a practical working model of that international co-operation on which the peace of the world must ultimately depend.The Prime Minister emphasised Britain&apos;s belief that countries with relatively high standards of living should devote a proportion of their resources to thedevelopment of countries less fortunately placed and said that, despite the drain on its resources caused by two world wars, Britain was still playing a major partin raising the standard of living in under-developed countries. British investmentsin India, for example, amounted to about 82 per cent, of the foreign businesscapital put to work here. The Prime Minister concluded by referring to India&apos;plans for economic development, which he described as a great enterprise and agreat challenge. The Prime Minister said that on their success depended thefuture of democracy not only in India, but elsewhere in Asia. The British peoplehad watched India&apos;s progress with sympathy and goodwill and shared India&apos;shopes and aspirations.14. While the Prime Minister was thus engaged, Lady Dorothy attended a &quot; Family Day &quot; at the Home for Incurables, recentfy founded by Group CaptainCheshire near Delhi. A happy feature of this was the reading by Mrs. IndiraGandhi of a message to the Home from Her Majesty The Queen Mother.15. On the same day the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillanlunched with the President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad. In the afternoon Mr. Macmillanlaid the foundation stone of the new United Kingdom High Commission Office a function attended by the whole staff of the High Commission and almost the
whole of the United Kingdom community in Delhi. In the evening the PrimeMinister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan received a tremendous ovation at a CivicReception given in their honour by the Delhi Municipal Committee at the RedFort. The gardens of the Fort were turned into a fairyland of lights and werepacked with people; many more crowded along the route to the Fort taken bythe Prime Ministers car. The occasion was a remarkable spectacle of the goodwill of the Indian people towards Britain. The Prime Minister was visibly moved.He put aside his prepared speech and said that he &quot; could not have imaginedanything more wonderful than his reception &quot;; he only wished that his colleagues and the whole British people could have been there to see it. That night thePrime Minister and Lady Dorothy dined with the High Commissioner; the guests,included Mr. Nehru, and other Indian Ministers and Commonwealth high commissioners.16. On Saturday, the 11th January, the Prime Minister accompanied byMr. Krishna Menon, the Defence Minister, and General K. S. Thimayya, Chief ofthe Indian Army Staff, watched a full-dress rehearsal of the parade which was totake place on Army Day on 15th January. The Prime Minister then met theleading representatives of the United Kingdom community in India who had cometo Delhi especially for the occasion. A record of the discussion, which was greatlyvalued by the leaders of the United Kingdom community, is being sent to theCommonwealth Relations Office separately. The Prime Minister accompaniedby Lady Dorothy Macmillan then attended a lunch party given by the IndianFinance Minister, Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari.17. In the afternoon the Prime Minister held a Press conference at which about 150 Press representatives were present. At this conference the PrimeMinister was asked to express his views on a variety of questions, including thepossibility of &quot; summit&quot; talks, the control of nuclear weapons, the extent ofBritish participation in Indian economic development, and Kashmir. The PrimeMinister disposed of a number of unhelpful questions firmly and with goodhumour and the conference received a very good Press. Later in the afternoonthe Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan attended a large receptiongiven by the Vice-President and a further reception for members of the UnitedKingdom community given by the High Commissioner. The remainder of thePrime Ministers last evening in Delhi was spent in private discussion withMr. Nehru.18. The departure from Palam airport early on Sunday, the 12th January,was characterised by the same friendly informality as the arrival. The PrimeMinister told Press representatives at the airport that his visit had far exceededanything he had expected in the kindness, courtesy and warmth that had been shown to him. He added that he knew that the welcome had not been given tohim as a person, but to his country and he felt that it symbolised a new andcreative period of partnership between Britain and India. A copy of a farewellmessage subsequently sent by the Prime Minister to Mr. Nehru is attached at annex C*. Copies of the Prime Minister^ speeches and of his broadcast and atranscript of the Press conference have been sent separately to Ihe commonwealth relations Office. Records of his talks with Indian Ministers, other thanMr. Nehru, and of the discussion with representatives of the British communityare also being forwarded separately.19. There can be no doubt that the Prime Minister^ visit was outstandinglysuccessful and a great personal triumph. That is the unanimous view of myCommonwealth colleagues, of the Western representatives in Delhi, of the IndianPress, of the United Kingdom community and of the many Indians, official andunofficial, who rejoice in a strengthening of Indo-British friendship. A friendlyreception for the Prime Minister was assured, but few expected the spontaneousoutburst of friendship for Britain which the visit produced. The atmosphere of goodwill was powerfully felt and it is interesting and of importance to attempt to analyse the reasons for it.20.

become accustomed to give to foreign representatives of differing political creedsand despite the political differences that had arisen between the Indian and british governments in the last year or so, there was still a special quality of familyassociation between India and Britain. The Prime Ministers visit thereforetouched a latent source of goodwill in the Indian people which had not previously been able to find expression at the level of political utterances and Press comment.21. The second major reason for the success of the visit lay in thepersonalities of the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan themselves.Some Indians, influenced perhaps by reports from sections of the British Press,seemed to have thought of Mr. Macmillan as a remote and rather cold personality.They were, therefore, surprised and delighted when the Prime Minister proved to be eminently approachable as he moved among Indians with an affable and ready word for everyone. Indeed, to the Indians of the villages and the streetsthe Prime Minister appeared as the embodiment of their ideal of an Englishmanand some Press correspondents even drew a comparison between the PrimeMinisters visit to Shamaspur and the visit of a benevolent English squire to apart of his estate. Many Indians also greatly appreciated the fact that in his speeches the Prime Minister talked to them directly and did not follow the example of those visiting statesmen who have made a practice in their speeches of lecturingand offering advice to the world at large.22. Lady Dorothy Macmillan also made a marked contribution to thesuccess of the visit. Her charm and ease of manner, her manifest interest andenjoyment in everything she saw and the unmistakable pleasure with which shereceived the welcome of DelhFs citizens made an immediate appeal to everyone.She was the Prime Ministers constant and sure support at public functions andin those engagements which she fulfilled independently she left an impression ofgraciousness and wide human sympathies on all who met her.23. The third reason for the success of the Prime Ministers visit lay, Ibelieve, in the appeal of its dramatic and historical elements to which I have madepassing reference above. The Prime Minister described these in his own wordsat his Press conference when he said that his visit idealised and crystallised thelong relationship between Britain and India. This first visit of a British PrimeMinister to India, while in office, was, in a sense, both symbolic recognition of the changed relationship between the two countries since 1947 and a reminder thattheir fortunes were still linked by the new bond of membership of theCommonwealth. The scene of friendly welcome at the airport, the Union Jackagain in Delhi side by side with the tricolour of independent India, and the sight of the two Prime Ministers driving together in their open car acknowledging theapplause of the crowds must have raised deep emotions in many Indian breastsas thoughts travelled back over the past. Most, no doubt, felt pride at the thought of a struggle for independence which had ended in a victory for both sides, butI suspect that for many Indians, especially during the Prime Ministers visit to the villages, pride was not without its element of nostalgia.24. It is, of course, too early to assess the long-term results. Some dissipationof the striking goodwill which the visit generated is inevitable as memories of itfade. The differences of view over specific issues still remain. It is, however,clear that the visit represented an important milestone in the history of relationsbetween India and Britain. There is a new hope of wider co-operation betweenthe two countries and the damage caused by sharp divergences over such issues as Suez and Kashmir has largely been repaired. Whether the new era of Indo-British relations of which the Prime Minister spoke will be possible without majoradjustments of policy and outlook on both sides remains to be seen, but theopportunity, at least, is now there in a way that would hardly have seemed possible a year ago.25. The Prime Ministers visit has also undoubtedly served to consolidate the Indian link with the Commonwealth and in this respect the visit could hardlyhave been more timely, following as it did so soon after the very successfulConference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Delhi last december. The effects of the Prime Minister^ visit have even been wider thanthat, for the Prime Minister^ success has been hailed here by the representativesof our allies outside the Commonwealth as a welcome blow for the cause and influence of the West and the free world as a whole.I have, &amp;c.W. A. W. CLARK.
PAKISTANUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Pakistan to Secretary of State for commonwealth relations  have the honour to report that the Right Hon. Harold Macmillan, PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom, accompanied by Lady Dorothy Macmillan,visited Pakistan from 12th to 16th January in the.course of his Commonwealthtour.2. At a very early stage, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan,Mr. Suhrawardy, and the President of the Republic made it clear how warmlythey welcomed the visit. The President, indeed, at once offered to place the greaterpart of his house at the disposal of Mr. Macmillan and his suite. This readyco-operation extended to all levels of the Pakistan Government who took thegreatest pains throughout the period of programme building to fall in with everysuggestion made to them and to explore every possibility of diversifying theprogramme. In the result, it was possible to make arrangements which covered inthe short time available many of the more important aspects of Pakistan life.3. Press publicity in Pakistan immediately before the Prime Ministers arrivalwas naturally coloured both by Mr. Macmillan&apos;s broadcast remarks about thepossibility of a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and by the differenceswithin the United Kingdom Government which led to the resignation of theChancellor of the Exchequer. Earlier, the local Press had given good coverage togeneral articles about the Prime Minister^ career and in contrast to officialguidance had suggested that the visit would be the occasion for a review ofinternational and regional problems and an examination of Pakistani concernover the Kashmir and the Indus Waters disputes. On the day of the PrimeMinisters arrival the Times of Karachi leader underlined this aspect of Pakistanthought about the visit. It paid tribute to Mr. Macmillan as &quot; an outstandingstatesman in a troubled world of mediocrity &quot; and to the post-war developmentof the Commonwealth as a prime example of a multi-racial association of equalnations. It went on to question whether it was wise to underestimate the dangers to the Commonwealth of the absence of any machinery for resolving importantdisputes (not least that over Kashmir) between members.4. The Prime Ministers arrival, punctually at 11 - 30 on Sunday morning,12th January, was managed with precision and effect. After being greeted by thePrime Minister of Pakistan and Begum Amjad Ali (deputising for Lady Noonwho was indisposed), myself and my wife, the Military Secretary on behalf of thePresident and the Chief of Protocol, Mr. Macmillan was conducted to a dais above which the flags of Britain and Pakistan were broken while a Guard of Honourpresented arms and the band played six bars of &quot; God Save The Queen &quot; and theNational Anthem of Pakistan. After inspecting the guard, the two Prime Ministersreturned to the dais where Malik Firoz Khan Noon made a brief but warm-heartedspeech of welcome. His th^me was the 1,000 years&apos; tradition of democracy in britain, the association of over 150 years between the sub-continent and the UnitedKingdom and the great movement towards self-government in the commonwealth in the last ten years. The Prime Minister in reply said that, although his staymust perforce be short, he looked forward to meeting old friends, making new and seeing something of the great progress Pakistan had made. The wonderfulwelcome which he and his wife had received had touched their hearts and, whenthey heard of it, would touch the hearts of British people at home and throughoutthe world.5. The Prime Minister was then introduced to Ministers of the CentralCabinet, senior officials, Heads of Diplomatic Missions and members of my staff and of the United Kingdom community in Pakistan. Lady Dorothy hadmeanwhile been introduced to the distinguished gathering of ladies who werepresent. Finally, standing in an open car alongside Mr. Noon, the Prime Ministeracknowledged the greetings of the public (who had not, however, turned out ingreat numbers) and had an especial wave for the large gathering of UnitedKingdom citizens who were assembled on the balcony of the airport terminal.My Lord,Karachi, 12th February, 1958
The Prime Ministers car was accompanied on the drive to the Presidents Houseby an escort of naval motor-cyclists who were replaced for the final part of the drive by a mounted detachment of the Presidents Bodyguard in full-dress uniform.6. After a quiet luncheon with the President, the Prime Minister paid a formal call on Malik Firoz Khan Noon at 5 p.m. during which the latter indicated that he would wish to raise a number of specific points at a later stage. In the evening the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy attended a Reception at myresidence where they had an opportunity of meeting politicians, senior officials,United Kingdom civilians, senior British and Pakistan Press representatives anda wide variety of Pakistanis. The President went, out of his way to attend thisReception. There followed a dinner by the President and Begum Mirza given ingreat state in the Presidents House, where the hall, stairs, and rooms were linedby the statuesque figure of the Bodyguard dressed in the uniform of the BengalLancers. Announced by a fanfare of trumpets, the President and Begum Mirzaentered the Durbar Hall where the guests were presented, after which the companymoved to the Banqueting Hall. At the end of dinner the President proposed thetoast (which was accompanied by music by a pipe band in the gardens below)*&apos; Her Majesty The Queen, Head of the Commonwealth.&quot; Mr. Macmillan repliedwith a toast to &quot; Major-General Iskander Mirza, The President of Pakistan, andto the happiness, prosperity and well-being of Pakistan.&quot; With jovial reluctance to forgo the pleasure of speaking in Mr. Macmillaits honour himself, the Presidentthen asked Mr. Noon to welcome the distinguished guest.7. The Pakistan Prime Minister, after referring to Mr. Macmillaits career,emphasised the unique occasion provided by this first visit of a United KingdomPrime Minister in office to the Commonwealth countries of Asia and Australasia.While not denying that there were differences between members of theCommonwealth, he said that it was remarkable how great an identity of viewspersisted, lending the organisation vitality and resilience. Of the Baghdad pact and SEATO, Mr. Noon said, &quot; We in this country view these two defensivearrangements as being most important for the well-being of the peoples of these areas.&quot; He concluded by expressing Pakistani gratitude for the &quot; generous aid and assistance &quot; which she had received from Britain.8. In his reply (the full text of which was telegraphed at the time)Mr. Macmillan deftly accepted the warm welcome extended to himself and his wife as a mark of the warmth of feeling and affection between Pakistan and theUnited Kingdom. Commenting on the progress made in Pakistan sinceIndependence, Mr. Macmillan compared Pakistani difficulties with those of thepost-war period in Britain and welcomed the fact that the Commonwealth hadbeen able to help Pakistan not only materially, but in the even more importantprocesses of pooling of ideas and joint consultation. After referring to the&quot; declaration of common purpose&quot; which resulted from his discussions withMr. Eisenhower in November, the Prime Minister emphasised that&quot;interdependence&quot; was the lifeblood of the Commonwealth and that thatassociation was an example to the world. The United Kingdom looked forward&quot; with some pride and hope to the further development of the commonwealth as new territories are brought to independence.&quot; To Pakistan, independence had brought new opportunities and responsibilities. The Government of the UnitedKingdom welcomed Pakistan participation in the United Nations and in the defensive Baghdad Pact and SEATO arrangements. These were in full conformitywith the United Nations Charter and within them great things had already been started in the economic, scientific and agricultural fields. The Prime Ministerconcluded this much-appreciated speech by the warmest reference to the valueof Pakistani staunch partnership in the free world&apos;s efforts to maintain and enrichthe principles for which it had fought so long.9. The programmes for the Prime Minister and for Lady Dorothy Macmillandiverged on Monday, .13th January. In the morning, after a simple wreath-layingceremony at the tombs of Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan, Mr. Macmillan visited the factories of one Pakistan firm (Valika Textiles) and two joint Pakistan-UnitedKingdom enterprises (Pakistan Tobacco and Pakistan Cables) on the new industrialestate just outside Karachi. He then toured the Naval Dockyard in Karachiharbour, and after a cruise in the Commander-in-Chiefs barge past the Pakistannaval units in the harbour, met their commanders informally on board the cruiserBctbur (ex-H.M.S. Diadem).  He subsequently lunched in the cruiser with senior
officers of the Pakistan Navy. Meanwhile, Lady Dorothy Macmillan visited threeprojects conducted under the auspices of the All-Pakistan Women&apos;s Association(A.P.W.A.). These were the Raana Liaquat Ali Khan Craftsmen&apos;s Colony, theA.P.W.A. College for Home Economics and the Girls&apos; College at Lalukhet, asuburb of Karachi. After a ladies&apos; lunch with the Begum Mirza at whichLady Dorothy Macmillan met some fifty ladies prominent in the social welfare and educational fields, she attended a tea party given by my wife at which theBritish Women&apos;s Association as well as A.P.W.A. were represented.10. In the afternoon of Monday, 13th January, the Prime Minister held a formal Press conference attended by some hundred Pakistan and foreigncorrespondents. A full transcript of Mr. Macmillan&apos;s opening statement and ofthe subsequent questions and answers has already been transmitted to your lordship&apos;s department. Suffice it here to say that the correspondents were mostfavourably impressed by the Prime Minister^ skill and candour in dealing withthe very wide variety of questions, some of which were highly controversial. Inconsequence, and as a result of the help which the Pakistan Information ministry and my Information Services were able to give with the recording and filming ofthe occasion, the conference received more detailed reporting than I can recollectof any other similar occasion in Pakistan.11. Later that evening, the Prime Minister, accompanied by Lady DorothyMacmillan, attended a reception given by the United Kingdom Association of pakistan and made an address. Although a private occasion, strictly limited to members of the Association (of which about 500 attended) this was one of themost moving moments in the Prime Ministers visit. He was visibly touched bythe reception accorded to his masterly (and largely impromptu) speech. Speakingwithout notes, the Prime Minister dwelt on Britain&apos;s place in the world throughher history and developed the theme that her influence had often been greatestwhen her material power was least. He ended by commending the UnitedKingdom community for their own fortitude and cheerfulness in the manyfrustrations inevitable in work and life in a young and underdeveloped country.His words so exactly caught the mood of the audience, that they rose in applauseand joined to a man in the well-known song of good fellowship. The eveningwas rounded off with a dinner by the Pakistan Prime Minister and Lady Noon.12. On the morning of Tuesday, 14th January, the Prime Minister recordeda broadcast for Radio Pakistan which was transmitted in the national servicelater in the day and filmed for television and newsreel purposes. In this talk(of which the text was telegraphed at the time) Mr. Macmillan spoke moreparticularly of the new links which were being forged between Pakistan and Britain. Of these he picked out the growing traffic of students and traineesreaching Britain, the reverse traffic of teachers and technical experts, the expandingbusiness connections (he mentioned that Britain had provided more than 90 per cent,of the total foreign private investment in Pakistan during the past four years),the close contacts between the armed services of the two countries and by nomeans least the common decision to meet international responsibilities by joiningSEATO and the Baghdad Pact. The Prime Ministers broadcast was prominentlyfeatured in all sections of the Press.13. At mid-day the Prime Minister attended a polished and exciting airdisplay by the Pakistan Air Force and stayed to a lunch at Mauripur with theCommander-in-Chief at which he met senior Air Force officers. The afternoonwas devoted to a series of important business talks between the two Prime ministers and their advisers at which the chief topics were the Kashmir and Indus Watersproblems, the supply of British arms to India, the negotiations for the transferof Gwadur to Pakistan and the negotiations for limiting Pakistan exports of textilesto the United Kingdom. Summaries of these talks were telegraphed at the timeand the agreed records have since been transmitted by bag. If it had achievednothing else, the Prime Minister^ visit would have been justified by the frankmeeting of minds which took place over these topics which lie uppermost at presentin the thoughts of the Pakistan Government.14. Later the Prime Minister met a group of leading members of the UnitedKingdom community who had been especially invited for the occasion from all parts of Pakistan. He heard their views on the economic, financial and commercialproblems faced by Pakistan and by British business men here and said that theUnited Kingdom Government would study the specific suggestions made and see what they could do to help. A full record of these discussions follows under
cover of a separate despatch. From all accounts the group were thoroughlysatisfied with these discussions and I believe that they have gone back to theirstations with every intention of describing their satisfaction to their colleagues and associates throughout the country.15. During the day Lady Dorothy Macmillan visited the Gul-e-RaanaIndustrial Home, where some 110 refugee women are engaged in handicraftproduction and the Cottage Industries Centre where the products of the IndustrialHome and other similar institutions are sold to the public. Lady Dorothy lunchedwith Lady Noon. In the evening the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy attended a reception by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which was followed by a dinnerat my residence at which the Prime Minister of Pakistan, members of the CentralCabinet, leading members of the Opposition and the Deputy Speaker were present.16. Nearly the whole of Wednesday, 15th January, was devoted to a visit by the Prime Minister, Lady Dorothy and most of their suite to Peshawar andthe Khyber Pass. A most welcome feature of the visit was that as soon as helearnt that the technical problems arising from the landing at Peshawar of so large an aircraft as the Prime Ministers Britannia had been solved, the PrimeMinister of Pakistan expressed a desire to accompany the party. The pakistan government also generously put a P.A.F. aircraft at the disposal of visiting andresident Press correspondents to enable them to travel to Peshawar and back tocover this part of the programme. At Peshawar airport the party was greetedby the Chief Minister of West Pakistan, the Chief of Staff of the Pakistan Armyand a gathering of frontier personalities which included two Pakistan V.Cs. and service pensioners, many of whom had come long distances for the occasion. Onthe way up to the Khyber, the Prime Minister inspected the Fourth cavalry regiment (armed with tanks) and was received at Jamrud with traditionalhospitality by a group of some sixty leading tribal maliks (headmen) backed by animpressive assembly of tribesmen. I have heard from many sources that this wasthe most impressive gathering of tribal maliks which has ever assembled on suchan occasion. After greetings, garlandings and presentations of the customarysheep and locally made weapons, the leading malik came to the point. &quot; We have heard your words that Britain follows a policy of neutrality over Kashmir. but you should support the party which has justice and right on her side.&quot; The malikalso referred to the Indus Waters dispute and said that if India carried out herthreat to divert the waters the tribesmen might have to make &quot; more sacrifices.&quot;In reply, the Prime Minister pointed out that the United Kingdom was now onlyone of a number of equal members of the Commonwealth. But he was in close touch with the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the United Kingdom would do allthat was possible to bring about a peaceful solution. This response was takenin good part.17. There followed the winding ascent to the Pass, a short stop at the frontierpost at Torkham and a highly successful lunch and display of Kattak dancingin the gardens of the Khyber Rifles&apos; Mess at Landikotal. After this the partydrove back to the airport, diverging from the route to pass through the campusof the new Peshawar University. On his return to Karachi the Prime Ministersfinal engagements were an informal meeting with High Commissioners of commonwealth countries represented in Karachi and a quiet dinner with thePresident who had invited the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army.Lady Dorothy attended a reception by A.P.W.A. The following morning at8 - 30 the Prime Minister and his party left on their way to Ceylon after a simpleceremony of leave-taking at the airport.18. In retrospect the outstanding impression which this visit has left with meis of the warm feelings which the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy left with the considerable number of people they were able to meet. Something of this wasto be expected. The leaders of Pakistan in every field are very conscious of thespecial relationship between the two countries, deriving not only from theCommonwealth connection but from the community of interests which they share in the field of foreign affairs and also from the traditional respect and affectionwhich grew up between the two peoples, particularly in the Army, during theperiod of British rule. But the degree of warmth which the unassuming butdignified personalities of the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy evoked wherever they went was perhaps not so widely anticipated and their easy informality madea most happy impact which will long be remembered.
19. This was the first visit of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in office to this sub-continent. The visit to Karachi followed that to Delhi whereit would appear that Mr. Macmillan received a more spontaneous welcome from thepublic at large than he did in Karachi. There are special reasons for this which Ishall discuss in a subsequent despatch in the context of Pakistani relations withthe United Kingdom and Commonwealth. Here I can say without any reservationthat the Prime Minister^ visit to Pakistan was not only an immediate persona;success, but should, I believe, also lead to precisely that development of understanding between leaders of the Commonwealth which was connoted byMr. Macmillan&apos;s declared purpose in travelling to &quot; listen, see and learn.&quot;I have, &amp;c.ALEXANDER SYMON.CEYLONUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Ceylon to Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations my Lord, Colombo, 6th February, 1958I have the honour to report that the Prime Minister, accompanied by Lady Dorothy Macmillan, visited Ceylon from the 16th to 18th January in the course oftheir Commonwealth tour. The fact that this was the first time a Prime Ministerof the United Kingdom had, while in office, visited Ceylon caught the imaginationof the public here.2.   The Prime Minister and his party arrived at Katunayake airport in theearly afternoon of the 16th January and were received with the ceremonycustomarily accorded here to visiting Heads of States and Prime Ministers.  Thiswas the first time a State reception had been arranged at Katunayake airport which,though in the main a Service airfield, had been suitably decorated for the occasion.(At the last minute I had been called in to overcome alleged R.A.F. objections to service buildings being decorated but on investigation had been unable to find that anyone in authority had so objected.)  A substantial number of people hadcollected all along the 23-mile route of the State drive and their demeanour wasthroughout uninhibitedly friendly and the Prime Minister was frequently applauded.Indeed the cheerful friendliness of the bystanders was a notable feature throughoutMr. Macmillaifs visit and the return drive to the airport on the last morning wasmade in an open car with Mr. Macmillan at times standing up and waving. After a brief rest at Queen&apos;s House, Mr. Macmillan proceeded to Temple Trees for a press conference and then to the Prime Ministers house for an hour&apos;s discussion withhim.  The Prime Minister was then taken by Mr. Bandaranaike on an unscheduledvisit to a display of Sinhalese dancing in aid of the Flood Relief Fund and wasreleased barely in time to put in an appearance at the reception which I gave inhonour of him and Lady Dorothy at Westminster House.  This was followed by aState Banquet at Queen&apos;s House (at which the health of the Queen of Ceylon, Headof the Commonwealth, was drunk).   The following day the Prime Minister and lady Dorothy Macmillan drove to Kandy, paid a brief visit to the Temple of theTooth (where the fact that they were not shown the Tooth itself was due solely to the hour of the day and the limited time available), visited the University for thePrime Minister to receive an Honorary Doctorate of Law, lunched at King&apos;sPavilion after planting a tree in the grounds, visited the Botanical Gardens atPeradeniya where a further tree was planted, and returned by car to Colombo.  Inthe early evening, Mr. Bandaranaike gave a reception for them at Temple Trees atwhich films of flood damage were shown.  Thereafter the Prime Minister attendedand addressed a Parliamentary Dinner given by the President of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives. (On this occasion the Chairman proposed the Toast of The Queen, which was drunk to the accompaniment of &quot; God Save the queen &quot; and Mr. Macmillan was asked to reply with the Toast of Sri Lanka, whichwas drunk to the accompaniment of &quot; Narao Namo Matha &quot;.) Meanwhile, Lady Dorothy was attending a small ladies&apos; dinner party given by my wife.  The PrimeMinister and his party left early on Saturday, 18th January.
3. The Ceylon authorities had obviously exerted themselves over thearrangements, which went remarkably smoothly, and the Governor-General showedhimself to be an understanding and charming, as well as a dignified, host in all theproceedings at Queen&apos;s House and King&apos;s Pavilion. The Times of Ceylon issued aspecial British supplement to mark the visit.4. Almost the whole programme outlined above is common form fordistinguished visitors of the highest categories and has, for instance, since been repeated for the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia. The two events which served to mark the special nature of this visit in the eyes of the host country were theconferment of the Honorary Degree by the University and the ParliamentaryDinner, at which the Prime Minister made a speech of greater informality andfrankness than would have been attempted by a foreign visitor. Despite, however,the depressing uniformity of the programme offered to distinguished visitors here,whether persons of great consequence or not so great, and whether representingfriendly countries or those not so friendly (an uncommitted country cannot publiclyadmit to being not equally friendly with all), it can, I think, be claimed that the visit was a real success both at the popular level and among thinking people. At the popular level, though the visit scarcely aroused the same interest as those ofMr. Nehru or Mr. Chou En-lai last year, the degree of enthusiasm was remarkableconsidering that the visitor was after all a European. There was no doubt at allabout the spontaneity and warmth of the welcome which the Prime Ministerreceived wherever he drove. I am told that in places members of the crowd wereheard shouting &quot; Come back soon.&quot; At a higher level, everyone appears to havebeen genuinely pleased to see the Prime Minister (though the &quot; Trotskyist &quot; Ministerof Agriculture and Food (Mr. Philip Gunawardena) and the Minister of industries and Fisheries (Mr. P. H. William de Silva) were conspicuous by their absence fromall the proceedings) and to have been pleased at his friendly bearing and understanding of local problems. At the same time the visit will have served tofocus thinking on the Commonwealth and the value of the commonwealth connection. The Ceylon Daily News summed this feeling up in the following paragraph:  &quot; Mr. Macmillan&apos;s visit is a reminder of a further benefit whichmembership of the Commonwealth confers on a small country like our own.It affords Ceylon the opportunity of direct contact with one of the centres of power in international politics and offers her a means of putting her ownviewpoint in world affairs before one of the great Powers in regular and friendly consultation which would not otherwise be available to her. Such anopportunity is valuable to a small country like Ceylon which wishes to playher part in the mitigating of world tensions and the furtherance of peace.&quot;5. Mr. Bandaranaike gave a public example of what the newspaper no doubthad in mind in its last sentence by publicly appealing to Mr. Macmillan in his speech at the Parliamentary Dinner not to drop the idea of a non-aggression agreementwith the Soviet and assuring him that a very large section of the peoples of theworld would be behind him if he pursued it. In his speech he also paid tribute tothe contribution that British common sense and sanity could make to the solutionof international problems. &apos; There is indeed some ground for hoping that the PrimeMinisters visit, which came at a moment when Mr. Bandaranaike&apos;s domesticfortunes were at a somewhat low ebb, exercised a most valuable influence uponMr. Bandaranaike himself and helped to bring him to a more just appreciation ofwhat membership of the Commonwealth means. Certainly, in his dealings with hisLeftist colleagues and otherwise, Mr. Bandaranaike seems, since the PrimeMinisters visit, to have shown rather less of what you, Sir, have called his habitual&quot; infirmity of purpose.&quot;6. In his speech to the Members of both Houses, the Prime Ministerannounced the gift from the United Kingdom Government of a further  10,000worth of relief supplies, but took the occasion to point out that the first requirement in the task of reconstruction was the framing of a programme whose scope andphasing would depend on the physical resources available. The United KingdomGovernment was ready and anxious to help by providing any additional technical assistance which might be required to frame and carry through such a programme.Mr. Macmillan went on, with some frankness and with obvious aim, to offer some general observations on the necessity for countries desirous of attracting externalcapital in a capital-hungry world to provide conditions of security sufficient to offer
inducement to the private investor. These remarks were taken up and endorsed inleading articles in the newspapers of the &quot; Times &quot; group with whom, however, sucha line has been not altogether unknown before. I recently had an opportunity toask the Governor-General what impact he thought these remarks by the PrimeMinister had made on the Members of Parliament who heard them. He repliedthat they were, of course, delighted to hear these things said in public, provided thatthey did not have to say them themselves.7. This reply I find illuminating in a wider context. There are still many people in public life in Ceylon, as well as outside it, whose outlook, as citizens of anewly independent and nationalistic Asian country go, is both moderate andsensible. What is, however, so sadly lacking is the moral courage to attempt to guide the poorer and less-sophisticated part of the electorate and wean them fromthe short-sighted courses and the slogans to which they are naturally attracted byglib speakers. With so many of the country&apos;s leaders, to borrow one of the classicaltags which still find favour in a country in many ways pleasantly old-fashioned, it isa case of&quot; Video meliora proboque ; deterioration sequor.&quot;Let us hope that the Prime Minister^ visit will have done something towardsstiffening them.I have, &amp;c.A. F. MORLEY.NEW ZEALANDUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in New Zealand to Secretary of State for commonwealth relations my Lord, Wellington, 10th February, 195SI have the honour to report on the visit which the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy Macmillan paid to New Zealand from the 20th to the 28th January inthe course of their Commonwealth Tour.2. The Prime Minister and his party did by far the greatest part of theirtravelling by road. This enabled them to see quite a lot of the North Island and atleast something of the South Island. What they saw they saw in good weather. the summer has been detestable in nearly every part of New Zealand, especiallyWellington, but wherever the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothy went they broughtgood weather with them. An old Austin Princess was brought out for the PrimeMinister and Lady Dorothy, but it broke down on the second day after some veryhard driving. Thereafter they and most of the party travelled in new AustralianChryslers, a fleet of which the New Zealand Government have recently bought.Their performance may be satisfactory, but in comfort they cannot compare with british cars or with the older types of Chrysler.3. The Prime Ministers arrival in Auckland on a lovely day in a Britannia the first ever to touch down in New Zealand attracted a considerable crowd of people whom he addressed and saluted with spontaneous and unrehearsedinformality. This was the first of a number of similar occasions, and I must confessthat I was surprised and I think New Zealand officials were equally surprised by the large numbers of ordinary men and women who turned out, not only in the cities, but in the small townships and along the roadside to wave a welcome. NewZealanders are no more demonstrative than the rest of the British race, but on thisunique occasion they were enthusiastic to show their appreciation of the first british prime Minister to visit New Zealand while in office. In Hamilton the crowds were considerable and blocked the street around the hotel where the Prime Ministerlunched. At Cambridge, where no stop had been planned, a crowd of excitedpeople led by the Mayor streamed across the road and forced the cortegeof cars to come to a halt. The Prime Minister was much touched and made thema little speech at the roadside. Wellington adopted the air of an experienced capitalcity where these things happen every day, but there were again enthusiastic crowdsin Dunedin and a very large throng of people at Timaru sitting in an open-air theatre
in the blazing midday sun. To all these spontaneous gatherings the Prime Ministerspoke with sincerity and humour and the crowds responded gladly to his warmpersonal touch. He was equally successful in the few words which he spoke toKing Koroki and the Elders of the Waikato-Manipoto Tribe at Turangawaewaewhere he was received in traditional Maori fashion.4. The Prime Minister made two major speeches during the course of his visit.The first was at the State Luncheon in Wellington on 23rd January. In this speechthe Prime Minister dealt with the relationship of the Commonwealth to the rest ofthe world. He pointed out that the close ties binding the countries of theCommonwealth together were not in any way weakened by friendships made withlike-minded nations outside the Commonwealth. This led him to stress theimportance of the link between the Commonwealth and the United States and ofthe&apos; Declaration of Interdependence which he and President Eisenhower had recently made. He also asserted his belief that closer associations between theUnited Kingdom and the countries of Western Europe, far from weakening theCommonwealth, would in the end bring it increased prosperity and power. Thebest safeguard of the vital interests of the free world was, in his opinion, the close co-operation of the British Commonwealth, the United States and Western Europe.This&apos;speech was well received and well reported. It gave pleasure to the majorityof New Zealand opinion, though there is a section of New Zealanders, whosespokesman is the Dominion newspaper, who feel a good deal of hesitation about the close link with the United States largely because of their mistrust of the personalityand policies of Mr. Dulles. The speech gave particular pleasure to therepresentatives of Western European countries who, generally speaking, find NewZealanders either-indifferent or hostile to the efforts they are making towards greaterunity. The United States.Ambassador has since told me that he thought the speech of the greatest possible value and that he had reported it with much commendationdirect to the President. The second important speech was made to the CanterburyChamber of Commerce in Christchurch. It dealt inevitably with somewhat more severe subjects, but there is no doubt that the audience of 360 men who crowdedinto a small space to hear him were impressed with the Prime Ministers remarkson the negotiations for a European Free Trade Area and on the general questionof economic relations between New Zealand and the United Kingdom. I shallrefer to this subject again later in this despatch.5. Apart from these public speeches, the Prime Minister had a number of conversations with Mr. Nash and members of the new Cabinet in this country.These conversations have already been reported in detail. I will touch on one ortwo points only. The Prime Ministers appraisal of the importance of India and ofthe value of Mr. Nehru&apos;s personal contribution in the struggle against Communismmade a great impression upon Mr. Nash. He had expected, I think, that thePrime Minister would be somewhat critical of Mr. Nehru&apos;s neutralist attitude; ifthis had happened, Mr. Nash&apos;s temperament would have led him into criticalcomments on the inflexible attitude of the United Kingdom. The very just andprofound review made by Mr. Macmillan put Mr. Nash&apos;s thinking into a far wiserperspective. The same can, I think, be said of other members of the Cabinet whoheard the Prime Minister^ review of world affairs. Most of these Ministers are quite inexperienced and have little knowledge beyond New Zealand&apos;s internalproblems. They were evidently impressed and interested and will, I am sure, be just as co-operative as their predecessors. At present, nevertheless, the Governmentand people of New Zealand are principally concerned v/ith economic problems,particularly those relating to their overseas trade. The discussion on these subjectswith New Zealand Ministers was very valuable because it produced the firststatement of the views of the new Labour Government on New Zealand&apos;s economic relations with the United Kingdom. There are indications that New ZealandMinisters feel that the meeting was somewhat inconclusive, but its nature made thisunavoidable. The discussion centred on the proposed revision of the ottawa agreement and it is clear that on this matter the policy of the present government does not differ materially from that of its predecessor. Mr. Nash and his colleaguessaid that New Zealand desired to negotiate a revision of the Ottawa agreement which would give her a right to reduce United Kingdom margins of preferencesimilar to that granted Australia in the agreement signed in February 1957. Usingfamiliar arguments, they developed their case, the crux of which was that, as theUnited Kingdom cannot absorb New Zealand&apos;s expanding exports of primaryproduce, New Zealand must be able to reduce margins of preference in order to
develop new markets. This they supported with claims that the balance of tariffadvantage had shifted markedly in favour of the United Kingdom and that UnitedKingdom agricultural policies, which had led to a great increase in home production,particularly of milk, caused difficulties for New Zealand intensified by the dumpingof subsidised dairy produce in Britain. The Prime Minister could deal onlysummarily with these matters, but it was agreed that New Zealand&apos;s proposals should be communicated as soon as possible to the United Kingdom Governmentand discussed by officials in April with a view to completing negotiations for a revision of the Ottawa Agreement well before the Commonwealth EconomicConference.6. I have since had a private interview with Mr. Nash, who confirmed thathe found the Prime Minister^ visit of great value. The many complimentaryremarks which he made during the course of the visit were entirely sincere. He had expected, I fancy, to find a somewhat inflexible type of Conservative Prime Ministerand he admitted that he had not been quite sune what the reactions of some of hiscolleagues would be. Mr. Macmillan&apos;s sense of humour and friendly demeanourput all these fears to flight. Mr. Nash himself has considerable refinement of mind and a strong sense of humour and he took great personal delight in what perhaps i may be permitted to describe as the gentle Oxford jokes with which the PrimeMinister seasons his speeches and conversation.7. Apart from his official meetings with Ministers and the Mayors of variouscities, the Prime Minister had some opportunities for meeting New Zealandersprominent in other walks of life. In particular, he met and had considerable discussion with leading representatives of the primary producers&apos; organisations.These men are very powerful in the economy and in the politics of this countryand they valued very highly their personal contact with the Prime Minister.8. Press coverage of the visit was considerable. Editorials referred with approval to the fact that the Prime Minister had swept aside his domestic difficultiesin order to fulfil his Commonwealth tour. The people of New Zealand were undoubtedly gratified that a Prime Minister in office should at last have visitedthem and the release of information about the work of ZETA at Harwell duringthe course of the tour helped to confirm their faith in the greatness of the UnitedKingdom. I must, however, add that comment in several newspapers showeddisappointment in connection with economic matters and especially with the alleged dumping of dairy produce in the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister^statement at his Press Conference in Wellington that New Zealand might be ableto make out a case to justify the United Kingdom taking action on this produced in some sections of the Press and in other quarters the reaction that New zealand had already made unsuccessful representations during the visits of two delegations to London in 1957 and an expression of surprise that the Prime Minister shouldnot know this. This reaction was undoubtedly due to ignorance of the facts. Ithas since been made clear by New Zealand Ministers that it is for New Zealand toprepare and present a case and that at the time of the Prime Ministers visit she hadnot done so. New Zealand Ministers, officials and public undoubtedly feel very strongly on this subject though the position is now better understood. It isunfortunate that this feeling should have attached itself in some degree to the PrimeMinisters visit.9. The detailed arrangements for the tour were in the experienced hands ofMr. Harper, the Secretary of the Department of Internal Affairs, who accompanied the Prime Minister throughout his tour. Mr. Harper&apos;s calmness was a valuableasset and the arrangements, the fruit of long and careful planning, went without ahitch. He was most ably assisted by Mr. Middlemass, one of the officers of his department. Some difficulty had been expected in ensuring that the Prime Ministerand his advisers enjoyed adequate telegraphic and decyphering facilities throughoutthe tour, especially when he was away from Wellington. These difficulties wereovercome largely through the agency of the Royal New Zealand Air Force whoprovided excellent communications links.I have, &amp;c.GEORGE MALLABY.
AUSTRALIAUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia to Secretary of State for commonwealth relations my Lord, Canberra, 28th February, 1958I have the honour to report on the visit to Australia of the Prime Ministerand Lady Dorothy Macmillan.2. The Prime Minister and his party arrived in Sydney from Christchurch at p.m. on the 28th January and travelled on to Canberra later on the same afternoon.After visiting Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, they returned to Canberraon the 10th February and left the following day for Singapore on their way backto London. My wife and I accompanied the Prime Minister and Lady Dorothythroughout their tour. *3. It could not reasonably have been assumed in advance that the tour wouldbe as successful as in the event it proved to be. It is true that the first visit toAustralia of a British Prime Minister in office was generally recognised to be an event of importance and significance but, largely because of the remoteness of thisContinent, the Australian outlook is in some respects remarkably parochial.Therefore it was not surprising that before the Prime Ministers arrival the general attitude was rather one of polite interest than of enthusiastic anticipation.Moreover, because of the set-backs which Mr. Macmillan&apos;s Government had received at recent by-elections and the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, manyAustralians had the impression that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s continued tenure of office was far from certain. At the same time, however, there was much appreciation ofthe fact that the Prime Minister had decided neither to cancel nor to curtail hisCommonwealth tour in spite of the difficulties with which he had had to contendimmediately before his departure.4. It must also be borne in mind that the antagonism between Australianpolitical parties of the Right and Left is more acute than anything to which weare normally accustomed in Britain. It was therefore understandable, if regrettable,that especially in an election year the Opposition should look with some mistrustupon an event which reflected credit upon Mr. Menzies&apos; administration. Moreover,it is unfortunately the case that if it suits their book politicians here do not scrupleto try and turn anything, even the presence of a distinguished visitor from overseas,to their own local advantage. This explains why, having done his best to use his interview with Mr. Macmillan to advance the cause of his party, Dr. Evatt couldnot refrain from issuing a statement immediately after Mr. Macmillan&apos;s joint press conference with Mr. Menzies describing it as &quot; a get-together of two exponents ofTory politics &quot; and as &quot; an essay in futility.&quot;5. Finally, there is that facet of the Australian character which leads certain sections of the Press to be continually on the watch for anything which might beconstrued as condescension or lack of courtesy on the part of visitors from overseas and particularly from Britain. This was amply illustrated by an incident atRichmond R.A.A.F. Station, where the Prime Ministers aircraft landed to refuelon the way from Singapore to New Zealand. Mr. Osborne, the Minister for Air,had travelled to the airfield in order to satisfy himself personally that everythingwent smoothly. The Prime Minister, who was suffering from a cold and who inany case did not know that Mr. Osborne was there, remained resting in the aircraft.His failure to appear was promptly interpreted by some newspapers as a deliberateand personal slight on Mr. Osborne and, although both Mr. Menzies andMr. Osborne made it perfectly clear that they were not in the least put out,references to the incident continued to appear during the week which intervenedbetween the short stop at Richmond and the Prime Ministers arrival at Sydneyfrom New Zealand.6. I have set out this background at some length because I think it helps tounderline what a remarkable personal success the Prime Minister achieved. Fromthe moment of his landing at Sydney airport until his final departure from Canberrahis popularity continued to increase. His obvious personal interest in the peoplehe met and the things he was shown, the enthusiasm with which he carried out afull and exacting programme and the breadth and sincerity of his speeches made
a deep impression even upon those who did no more than see him on television and the newsreels or listen to him on the wireless. Australians in general, alwaysanxious to look to Britain for leadership, were delighted to find that their visitorwas at the same time a statesman of world stature and a warm and responsivehuman being.7. There can be no doubt that Lady Dorothy&apos;s presence made an invaluablecontribution to the success of the tour. On most days arrangements had been madefor her to carry out one or two engagements separately from the Prime Minister,and this enabled her to meet a considerable number of women&apos;s organisations. Onall occasions her friendliness and her genuine interest in ordinary people and their,everyday affairs won for her the affection of those With whom she came in contact.8. I have reported separately upon the Prime Minister^ five meetings withAustralian Ministers, covering a wide range of topics of interest to the two countries.In one instance, at least, the decision to proceed with the construction of the MalaccaCantonment, the opportunity was taken to clear up a question which had hungfire for many months. Indeed, but for the force and skill of the Prime Ministerspersonal intervention this issue could not have been settled in a manner satisfactory to us. But, as I see it, the most valuable aspect of the talks was that they enabled the Prime Minister to give Australian Ministers an insight into commonwealth and foreign affairs such as they find impossible to acquire in the normal course oftheir work here. Several of them have since expressed to me their admiration ofMr. Macmillan&apos;s grasp of world affairs and his readiness to approach the problemsof South-East Asia from the Australian point of view.9. During his tour of Australia the Prime Minister made no fewer than twelvemajor speeches and gave at least as many talks of a more informal nature. his main speech, which was delivered at the Parliamentary Dinner in Canberra onthe 29th January and was broadcast throughout the country, was well received.In Brisbane, the capital of a predominantly agricultural State, the Prime Ministerchose to speak of food production and sought in particular to reassure his audiencethat in their policy towards the proposed European Free Trade Area the BritishGovernment has constantly in mind the interests of Commonwealth countries,especially Australia. At the State dinner in Melbourne he spoke about Britain&apos;defence policy, emphasising especially the inter-dependence of the countries of thefree world, the importance of conventional forces for the defences of South-East asia and the determination of the United Kingdom not to reduce her contribution tothe defence of that area. This speech was widely reported and undoubtedly madea deep impression. At another function in Melbourne, a luncheon given by theVictorian Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures, the Prime Ministers speechwas devoted to economic and financial questions, with particular stress on thevolume of United Kingdom investment in Australia. The Prime Minister referredfrequently in public to the need for Australia to increase her population andreaffirmed that, although emigration involved some sacrifice for Britain, it wasone which Britain was glad to make in the wider interests of the commonwealth as a whole. Much attention was paid to the emphasis which Mr. Macmillanplaced in many of his speeches on the role of the Commonwealth and of the Asianmembers in particular.10. In each State, but particularly in Queensland and Victoria, the Pressdevoted many columns to descriptions of the Prime Ministers movements and toreports of his speeches. Mr. Macmillan gave an interview to the Press and totelevision immediately on his arrival at Sydney airport. He met the Pressinformally on his first visit to Canberra and in each of the State capitals, and onhis return to Canberra he held a joint Press conference with Mr. Menzies. Theseinterviews all went off successfully and the general feeling among the journalistscovering the visit was that they had been given ample opportunity to question thePrime Minister about his impressions of Australia and the policy of the UnitedKingdom on matters of interest to this country. The final Press conference inCanberra lasted for a full hour and covered a wide range of topics, in particularAntarctica, the Free Trade Area, the Commonwealth Economic Conference and united Kingdom investment in Australia. During the visit one or two newspapershad been carrying a story that the Prime Minister had attempted, though without success, to obtain a greater measure of assistance from the Australian government towards the defence of South-East Asia and he had to answer a number of questions on this subject.
II. Throughout the visit Mr. Macmillan and his party were the guests ofthe Australian Government and a Convair of the Royal Australian Air Force was provided to fly them on their journeys between the various capital cities. Thearrangements for the visit were in the hands of the Prime Minister^ Departmentwho worked in close touch with my office and showed the greatest willingness toaccept our suggestions. The credit for the good shape and balance of theprogramme belongs chiefly to Mr. M. C. Timbs, who was responsible for the planning and for the extremely difficult task of liaison with the various Stateauthorities. Mr. Timbs and Mr. Backen, another officer of the Prime MinistersDepartment, accompanied the party throughout the tour and their presence wasinvaluable in assuring that a full and often complicated programme was completedwithout a single hitch.12. There can be no doubt whatever that, as Mr. Menzies remarked at thePress conference, &quot; The visit of the Prime Minister to Australia has been beyondall question a wonderful success &quot; and the same thought was repeated in the extremely friendly leading articles which appeared in all the principal newspaperson the Prime Ministers departure. The breadth of outlook shown by the PrimeMinister both in the Ministerial discussions and in his public speeches left a profound impression. Many Australians had been feeling some concern aboutBritain and her place in the councils of the world and they have had doubts aboutthe ability of the Western nations to provide effective international leadership. the impact of the Prime Ministers personality has greatly reassured them. when mr. Macmillan left Sydney airport after his visit to New South Wales, thePremier, Mr. Cahill, was heard to comment &quot; The old country can still turn them out.&quot; Mr. Cahiil is a shrewd politician, but I am certain that this was a genuinereaction and one which accurately reflects a general and lasting feeling. Moreover,largely because of this country&apos;s geographical position on the fringe of the world,these is a widespread feeling in Australia that her hopes and needs are of too littleaccount to the great Powers of the West. Australians now know that in the PrimeMinister of the&quot;United Kingdom they have a man who has seen their country for himself, who understands their achievements and who sympathises with theiraspirations. It has given them pleasure to feel that the benefits of this visit weregenuinely mutual, and that, while the Prime Minister had much to give to them,they for their part were able to give him a closer understanding of the importance and significance of the modern Commonwealth.13. The tour therefore has been of immense value in raising British prestige in Australia, and I very much hope that not too many years will be allowed topass before another such visit is arranged.I have, &amp;c.CARRINGTON.
