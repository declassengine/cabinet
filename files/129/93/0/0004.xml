SECRET33 &amp;MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNME;^):&apos;C.(58) 10410th May, 1958COPY NOCABINETREVIEW OF PREPARATIONS FOR an industrial EMERGENCYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy seal at yesterday&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet.(C.C.(58) 39th Conclusions,Minute 3) I summarised the plans which have been considered at frequentmeetings of the Official Committee on Emergencies and at two meetingsof the Ministerial Committee.   I now circulate a short paper setting outthe present position.Declaration of Emergency2.        In the event of a railway strike, or of wider industrial trouble,it would be necessary to proclaim a state of emergency and to raaikeEmergency Regulations.   They are ready.The Emergencies organisation.        Centrally, the intention is that the Ministerial Committee, theOfficial Committee, and the Transport Sub-Committee would meet dailyso that decisions could be taken on questions as they arise.   Arrangementsfor the co-ordinated issue of information have also been completed.4.        Arrangements have been made for picked Ministers to proceedto Regional Headquarters if the need arises.   Immediately before the occurrence of a railway strike or wider industrial trouble senior civilservants would be sent to all Regions to preside over Regional emergency committees.   Transport and Power Sub-Committees exist in all Regions.Use of Servicemen and Vehicles5.        The Service Departments can make available without majordislocation of their functions approximately 7,400 manned vehicles and  ,94,000 men.   These totals could be increased to approximately 16,000vehicles (there may be difficulty in finding trained drivers for all ofthem) and 180,000 men.   To make this possible, plans are being preparedfor the suspension by categories of training and drafting of all three services during the emergency.   The suspension of releases would make,a small further addition to the total man-power available, but cannot beundertaken except in conjunction with the calling out of the Reserve or byi-Proclamation;   if this were done, release-could be suspended without delayor serious difficulty.-1-

The rate of issue of vehicles over and above the total of 7,400immediately available would proceed at the rate of 4,000 a week, unlessinstructions are given to prepare vehicles in depots well in advance.   Ishall keep in close touch with the Secretary of State for War on this point and consult the Prime Minister as necessary.Use of Volunteers7.        All Ministry of Labour Employment Exchanges are ready to dealwith volunteers when and if a call for them is made.   We must decide; indue course, and at the right moment, when to make such a call.   In theevent of a railway strike by itself few people have relevarttnexperience.If unsolicited volunteers present themselves at any Exchanges those withskills that might be useful would be sent to the nearest employer, e. g.the nearest railway station.Picketing and Intimidation8.        A statement which could be made, if necessary, about picketingand intimidation has been agreed with the Solicitor-General.Stocks of Coal-and Oil9.        Stocks of coal held by the public utilities are high, and theMinister of Power has undertaken to see whether they can be further increased.   Other sectors of industry are understood to have stocks for about three weeks;   on the average there is considerable variation,and it must be assumed that serious difficulties would arise at about theend of the second week of a railway strike.   Stocks of oil held by theindustrial consumers represent on an average two to two and a half weekssupply.   A schedule of priorities for fuel use has been prepared.   Thenecessary powers are held and plans are ready to apply such restrictionsas may be required.Oil Distribution10.      An uncertain factor at present is the position in the oildistribution industry.   If a strike occurs Service drivers will be used to distribute oil.   It cannot be assumed that full supplies can be madeavailable in this way;  or that the use of Service labour for this purpose would not lead to a stoppage in part of the road haulage industry.   A listof priorities to be operated in the event of an oil shortage has beenprepared.Distribution of Stocks11.      Departments have been asked to consider what can be done tobuild up distributed stocks of food and fuel, but no approach has yet beenmade to the distributive trade.   It is intended to authorise departments to make such an approach once notice of a railway strike has been given.12.      In the event of a railway strike which did not spread to road transport, essential food supplies would probably be maintained for atleast three to four weeks, even without the intervention of the EmergenciesOrganisation, or any measures of self-help by the trade.

In the event of a railway strike which did not spread to road transport, essential food supplies would probably be maintained for atleast three to four weeks, even without the intervention of the EmergenciesOrganisation, or any measures of self-help by the trade.   There would,
however, be local shortages of particular commodities, especially of milk and fish in London.   If there should be at the same time a strikeinvolving road transport to any considerable extent, these localdifficulties would be much greater as soon as retailers1 supplies areexhausted.   It is to be expected, however, that retailers will replenishtheir own stocks by fetching supplies usually delivered to them; and itwill be the aim of the emergency transport arrangements to supplementtheir efforts so far as essential foodstuffs are concerned.   If, inaddition, there is a widespread stoppage at the docks, its effect uncheckedwould not become apparent to the consumer for two or three weeks.   Thefullest use, in an extreme situation of this kind, would be made ofService transport and labour.13.      It is probable that in a railway strike members of the british transport Commissions supervisory staff with operating experiencewould be willing to act as train crews and it might be possible in thisway to run between 200-300 trains a day.   About another twenty-fivetrains a day could be run if Army train crews were to be used.   (Normallythere are about 17,600 freight trains and about 23,000 passenger trainsa day.)  The facilities for carrying milk by road are limited and if notrains could be used it would be possible to maintain no more than about two-thirds of the normal supplies to London;  a simple system of priorities would be introduced.   Supplies of milk to London could bebrought practically up to normal if the number of trains mentionedabove could be run.General14.      To sum up, what preparations are possible to meet a railway strike, or a more serious emergency, have been made.   The government machinery is ready to operate at any time.   But there are obviouslymany uncertainties in the situation, and we shall have to tackle problemsfrom day to day as they arise.   I shall keep in the closest touch withthose of my colleagues who are most directly concerned, and shall askfor decisions, as necessary, to ensure that if the need arises we can actin the most effective way.R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.I.9th May, 1958
