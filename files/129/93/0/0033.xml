Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 133 Copy No.  27th June, 1958 ---CABINETFINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH EGYPTNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a memorandum prepared by officials on financial negotiations with egypt which recommends that, following the secret mission of Mr. Hamilton (ofthe Bank of England) to Cairo, we should inform the Egyptians that we areprepared in Rome to negotiate in principle on the basis of a lump sum settlement,though we should expect more than the  25 millions the Egyptians have informallysuggested as compensation for British private claims.2. I consider personally that any settlement on a lump sum basis which was less than . 30- 35 millions would be extremely embarrassing and would confrontus with demands from the claimants for substantial supplementary compensation which we should find it extremely hard to resist.3. On the other hand continued failure to settle this problem makes it increasing difficult to resist pressure on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to assume responsibility for paying compensation to British claimants. I therefore regard it as a matter of considerable importance that we should reach agreement if wepossibly can.4. I concur in the recommendations in paragraph .16 of this paper, subjectto our making it clear in the subsequent negotiations that the lump sum wouldhave to be substantially more than the  25 millions informally mentioned.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,26th June, 1958.53638
ANNEXFINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH egypt memorandum by OfficialsWith the approval of Ministers Mr. Hamilton of the Bank of England recentlypaid a private and informal visit to Cairo to discuss with Dr. Emary, the governor of the National Bank of Egypt, on what basis negotiations might be resumed.We knew that Dr. Emary was thinking along the lines of a lump sum settlementof the kind considered by the Cabinet on 13th May (C.C. (58) 41st Conclusions,Minute 8).2.   Mr. Hamilton has now returned and a copy of his report is appended.3. The main point which emerges is that the Egyptians are still pressing for satisfaction in some form of their claim for war damage. They do not accept our contention that in calculating the net payment due from them it should be offset against our claim for compensation for the loss of the Base. They regard this as war booty.4. The attraction of a lump sum settlement for them is that it would enablethem to reduce their liability to us by taking account of their war damage claim,without obliging us to make a public and explicit admission of liability. Providedwe are willing to settle our claims for a lump sum satisfactory to them, they willsign a letter stating that their claim has been offset against the loss of the Base.It would also avoid the need for neutral assessment of the value of Egyptianisedproperty.5. Our difficulty would be to justify to the British owners of property thefigure for which we had settled their claims. If it was clear that allowance hadbeen made for the Egyptian war damage claim against the United KingdomGovernment, they would naturally expect the Government to add an equivalentsum to the amount available for distribution as compensation. Subject to this,however, a lump sum settlement would probably be more satisfactory to the claimants than our original proposals, since they would clearly prefer to pursue their claims with Fler Majesty&apos;s Government rather than the Egyptian Government.6. Much depends therefore on the amount of the lump sum. Their formaloffer is  10 millions but Dr. Emary has indicated privately to Mr. Hamilton thatthey would be prepared to go to  25 millions.7. This payment would be intended to cover our claims both for Egyptianisedproperty and for damage to sequestrated property. In addition to the return ofour property and the resumption of trade on a non-discriminatory basis, the egyptians seem ready to accept our proposals on other matters such as:  (i) the percentage charged on the property by the Egyptian sequestrator forthe costs of administration;(ii) the return of rights and interests (copyright and trade marks and the rightof appeal against unfavourable tax settlements);(iii) facilities for the transfer of the sale proceeds of property belonging tothose who do not wish to go back to Egypt;(iv) compensation for the officials dismissed in 1951 and the resumption ofpensions, &amp;c.8. The main point to be decided is whether the offer of a lump sum of 10- 25 millions can be accepted as a basis on which to resume negotiations.9. One of the difficulties of a lump sum settlement is that we do not know the true value of our claims.   We know, however:  (a) that the Egyptianised assets have been valued by their owners at 47 millions. This, however, includes a claim for some  10 millions for goodwill which the Egyptians would contest, and it is in any caselikely that the estimate is considerably inflated;
(b) that claims in respect of damage to sequestrated property are even moredifficult to estimate. If the Shell assets are excluded, however (as beingthe subject of direct negotiation between the Company and the egyptian government), the claims for sequestrated property might amount tosome  5-  10 millions. The figure will be larger the longer the settlement is delayed.At a rough guess, therefore, the true value of our claims might be some  35- 40millions. A lump sum payment of  25 millions would mean that we were paying the Egyptians something of the order of   10-  15 millions for war damage apartfrom giving up our claim to compensation for the loss of the Base.10. In the earlier stages of the negotiations the Egyptians appeared to be willing to accept the idea of an advance payment for compensation of  30 millions,while the latest draft of the agreement handed over in March provided for an advance payment on account of Egyptianised property of  25 millions and a depositin respect of sequestrated property of  10 millions. Apart from this it is unlikelythat the figure of  25 millions is Dr. Emary&apos;s last word. We suggest, therefore,that our object should be to get the Egyptians to raise their offer to  30 millions.A net payment of this sum would enable claims in respect of sequestrated property(the owners of which are mostly small men) to be met in full, leaving a dividend ofabout half to two-thirds available for Egyptianised property.11. If the Egyptians paid us  30 millions they would expect the remainder of their balances amounting to some  47 millions to be released (in accordancewith the Sterling Releases Agreement) not later than 1st January, 1959. We mightbe able to get them to make from this sum a prepayment of the first two instalmentsdue to the Suez Canal Company under the agreement recently negotiated. they also owe  1-9 millions (nominal value) to the Sudan. There would be nothingleft in the No. 2 Account as security for capital transfers by British citizens who do not wish to go back to Egypt. Such payments would have to be a charge ortthe funds released.12.   The advantages of a settlement on these lines would be:  (a) Despite recent events in the Lebanon, the Foreign Office view is that it isstill politically important to restore diplomatic relations with Egypt ona basis that would be correct but cool. The Foreign Office would therefore consider it unfortunate if the opportunity presented by thelatest Egyptian proposals were not to be followed up. Moreover, ifevents in the Lebanon take a turn for the worse, it would always bepossible to break off negotiations should that be thought desirable.(b) The claimants themselves would naturally welcome the conclusion of anagreement and, as already stated, would probably prefer a lump sumsettlement which would enable them to pursue their claims with her majesty&apos;s Government. On the other hand it must be recognised thatif the Government take the responsibility of compounding Britishclaims for a lump sum, they are likely to be pressed to supplement theamount available for distribution. It is common knowledge that the egyptians have been pressing their claim for war damage. Even ifthe Egyptians do not say so publicly, the claimants would be likely toinfer that satisfaction of this claim was one element in the calculation of the lump sum. Against this we should have to say that no better terms could be obtained and that the alternative would have been a prolonged stalemate from which the claimants would have got nothing.(c) From an economic standpoint it would be to our advantage to resumetrade with Egypt, exports to whom might run to some  12- 14 millions a year.13. The only practicable alternative would be to prolong the present deadlock.The claimants would doubtless urge the Government to seize the sterling balances.There are however strong arguments against this course. It would damageconfidence in London as a centre in which to hold funds. It would put an end to any chance of our recovering our assets in Egypt (valued by their owners atsome  130 millions, less any damage suffered). Finally it would destroy any chanceof improving relations with Egypt.SECRET53638 b 2
14. We therefore recommend that we should be prepared to resume negotiations on the general lines proposed by the Egyptians but should make avery strong effort to get their offer raised from  25 millions to  30 millions. Weshould hope that Shell&apos;s claims against Egypt would be settled separately before an agreement was reached between Governments.15. If this policy is approved, our reply to the Egyptians might be to theeffect that we are prepared to negotiate in principle on the basis of a lump sumsettlement; that such talks should in our view be held in Rome; but that before thenegotiations are resumed, we would send them a draft agreement (in which thefigure for the lump sum would be left blank). It should at the same time be made clear to Dr. Emary that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would not be prepared tosettle on the basis of a payment of  25 millions but that they felt nevertheless thatthe gap between our respective positions could be bridged if talks were resumed in Rome.Recommendation16. We recommend that a reply should be sent to the Egyptian Governmenton the lines indicated in paragraph 15 above.June, 1958.APPENDIXANGLO-EGYPTIAN FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONSReport by Mr. Hamilton, Bank of England, on his Talks in cairo, 7th 112th JuneGeneralI was very well received by the National Bank of Egypt and shown everycourtesy throughout my stay. Because of the nature of my mission I confined mycontacts to people concerned with the negotiations and I advised M. Dubois ofthe Swiss Legation (who called upon me) that I thought it better not to meet anyrepresentatives of British interests in Egypt. I saw the Canadian Ambassador andhis First Secretary. They were most helpful over communications with London.I did not get in touch with the American Embassy and heard nothing from them.The Conversations2. Apart from one long talk with Hassan Zaki the conversations were withdraw. Emary, Governor of the National Bank, who is the main-spring of thenegotiations now that Zaki has been made the Minister dealing with home finance.The negotiations fall within the sphere of interest of Mr. Kaissouni, the EconomicMinister, and Mr. Kaissouni and Dr. Emary report jointly to Colonel Nasser.The President will not let the negotiations go far without being consulted and hasdefinite views on the type of settlement he wants.3. My telegrams give an indication of how the conversations proceeded butas Dr. Emary is a newcomer to the negotiations a lot of time was taken up in theearly stages in going over points already argued in Rome but the one main point to emerge was that Colonel Nasser was set on getting something for Egypfs warclaims. Whether it is true or not Dr. Emary maintained that they always expectedto get something for their war claims even at a later negotiation but their realisationthat the United Kingdom had no intention of paying anything had brought aboutthe present deadlock in the Rome talks. I set out the difficulties of assessing warclaims and requested brief details of their claims which were given. I asked whyno allowance was included for the Base and was told that no allowance wouldbe made for the Base as it was &quot; War Booty.&quot; I made no comment other than tosay that it showed how futile a discussion of war claims would be.  Dr. Emary
agreed but said that he had a figure of  50 millions in mind as the net payment dueto Egypt for war claims. I reminded him that in Rome the figure had been 30 millions.4. Having pointed out that there was little possibility of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment accepting public liability for war claims we discussed methods of introducing some offsetting amount in Egypfs favour without Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment assuming any liability. The various methods discussed are givenin (d) of the attached questions and answers but interest centred on the arrangementthat a lump sum settlement would be made in Egyptian pounds which would thenbe transferred into sterling at the current rate, at present 25 per cent, discount. Forexample, a settlement for  E.3H- millions would provide  25 millions sterling.5. In the discussion of war claims Dr. Emary agreed that his Governmentwould sign a letter waiving war claims provided that some camouflaging offsettingarrangement in their favour was introduced into the settlement. I asked him whatkind of announcement would be made in Cairo if Egypt signed a waiver of warclaims bearing in mind what Colonel Nasser had said publicly of his claims.Dr. Emary was unwilling to answer then and there but thought that Egypt would be content to say that they had kept the Base.6. During the course of the discussion I outlined the difficulties that a lump sum settlement presented to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in settling the claimswithout the authority of the claimants and with no precise knowledge of the suminvolved.7. Dr. Emary spoke strongly in favour of a lump sum settlement and he saidthat his instructions from Colonel Nasser were to make an arrangement which enabled relations to start again with a clean slate. I used this argument later topoint out that there were a number of subsidiary matters in the draft agreement that were trouble-makers if not settled and asked that they should be granted tothe United Kingdom in any lump sum settlement.  These items included: - (a) reasonable sequestration charges only;(b) restoration of rights and interest or some right of appeal againstunfavourable settlements by the sequestrator;(c) facilities for transfer of capital for people who do not wish to return to egypt;(d) payments to officials dismissed in 1951.Paragraph (e) of the attached Questions and Answers shows that the Egyptiansagreed to this.8. A basis of a lump sum settlement was therefore beginning to emerge ifthe net figure payable to the United Kingdom after making an allowance forEgyptian claims could be made to look more presentable. At the beginning it stood at  0-5 millions. I therefore outlined to Dr. Emary the difficultiesconfronting Her Majesty&apos;s Government in making any allowance for war claims oraccepting a lump sum settlement. I went on to show him that we were well aware of Egypfs own financial embarrassment and difficulties over cotton. I made itclear that he would be making a mistake if he thought he could get through these negotiations as easily as he had got through those with the Canal Company. Wehad a good hand of cards to play whereas the Canal Company had none. further discussion followed, the upshot of which was that in the Questions and Answersthe net figure in the United Kingdom&apos;s favour appears as  10 millions but this isa negotiating figure and Dr. Emary assured me that he thought he could persuade the President to agree to the figure being raised to  25 millions as a maximumin the negotiations proper. I then said that if Her Majesty&apos;s Government should show any interest in this proposal it would be necessary in any reply to put theUnited Kingdom asking net figure as &quot; at least  25 millions.&quot; Dr. Emary agreed and said that he would like to see the figure as &quot; at least  35 millions &quot; to providehim with better arguments for agreeing to  25 millions.9. Not being there as a negotiator I concluded that I could take the matterno further so I told Dr. Emary that I could not give him any assurance that the
proposal 1 was taking back would be regarded by Her Majesty&apos;s Government asa satisfactory basis for the resumption of negotiations but at least it had ceased tobe unreasonable.Resumption of Negotiations10. Matters were left that if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were interested in thebasis now put forward they should so indicate to the Egyptians through Bankchannels, stipulating any alterations of the basis that they might have in mind.Resumption of the negotiations could then take place in Rome but in order to avoid any delay over minor details of the draft Dr. Emary would very much prefer thatan amended draft agreement should either be sent out or taken out to him bysomeone who could discuss the draft in order that agreement on such details isreached beforehand. This would, he hoped, enable the main negotiations in Rometo be brief and successful. Dr. Einary also asked that the draft agreement shouldembody a goodwill preamble.Background Information11. In order to maintain the secrecy of my visit no attempt was made to havetalks with people outside the National Bank and therefore my information is derived mainly from them.12. The Egyptian financial position is not looking quite so bad as a resultof credits which they have been given by the Russians, Germans and others. Egyptare not therefore despairing of getting through although further restrictions on imports may be necessary. These credits, however, have not provided any greathelp to their cash position and the shortage of cash may necessitate a quicker mergerbetween the Central Banks of Egypt and Syria than was at one time thoughtprobable in order to enable Egypt to get hold of cash. Dr. Emary, while mentioningthe dangers of Egypt falling in with the Russians, did not make them so stronglyas some Egyptians. What he said was that the Russian credits were helpful and did not have strings attached but the overall position was not good and at sometime or other he would need help. The Russians were watching events closely andhe was sure that it would be when he went to them for help that strings would beattached. Therefore the draft agreement we had left with him was no good fromhis point of view because it gave him very little cash and left uncertain what hewould get in the end. Under a lump sum settlement he would get a greater releaseof cash which would be his reserve and would thus enable him to carry on for a longer period without having to ask for help from anybody. His general thinkingwas that he had enough commercial credits at the moment and did not want toask for more. On their general policy there was no question that, whether we likedit or not, a movement has started in the Middle East which must go on either in agreater or lesser degree and it would be unwise to ignore it. There is little doubt,however, that the ultimate aim is for Syria, the Lebanon and Jordan to be embodiedwith Egypt in the United Arab Republic with the disruption of Israel envisaged atsome time or the other.13. The need to re-establish friendly relations with the United Kingdom ona &quot; clean slate &quot; basis was stressed many times and Colonel Nasser had mentionedthis to Dr. Emary immediately on his return from Moscow. Colonel Nasser wasnot pleased with his visit to Moscow. The Egyptians are unhappy about theirdependence on Russian goods but German goods are now appearing and it is thiscompetition that the United Kingdom may have to fear in the future.16th June, 1958.
ANGLO-EGYPTIAN FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONSQuestions asked of the Egyptians and replies received from them(a) While it is understood that a lump-sumsettlement is preferred, would the present draft agreement be accepted by the egyptian government if an agreed arrangement and amount covering Egyptian claims was introduced into it, bearing in mind thedifficulties that a lump-sum settlementpresents to Her Majesty&apos;s Government?(b) If the answer to (a) is &quot; no,&quot; what are thefeatures of the draft agreement which arenot acceptable?(c) If there is a lump-sum settlement, what isthe figure that the Egyptian Governmenthave in mind as due to be paid to theUnited Kingdom after allowance has beenmade for Egyptian claims?(//) In view of the fact that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot accept responsibility forEgyptian claims, have the Egyptian Govern-ment any definite proposal how any allowance to Egypt should be camouflagedor offset in some other way?(e) Is   it   intended   that   for   a   lump-sumsettlement:  (i) The present draft agreement will bethe basis of the settlement withnecessary alterations in figures andwording.

We are prepared, however, tomeet the request by:  (i) omitting the value of goodwill fromcompensation claims;(ii) payment in   Egyptian to be transferredat a discount;(iii) a grant by Her Majesty&apos;s Government;and(iv) acceptance of payment in securities atpar.If the lump-sum settlement is agreed upon, thepresent draft has, of course, to be amended.Any other provisions not relating to thesettlement of claims may remain.Lump-sum settlement should cover:  (a) Egyptianised property.(6) Claims on account of desequestratedproperty,(c) Egyptian claims.Agreed, if there is a lump sum settlement.Transfers   over    5,000   will   be   favourablyconsidered.Lump sum payable in cash within one yearproviding for a convenient disposal of the securities.Shell claims may be settled separately, but on two major points discussions will not serveany good purpose, viz.:  (1) the concession for 61 areas;(2) organisation for the sale of petroleum products.No objection.
