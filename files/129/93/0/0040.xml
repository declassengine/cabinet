C.(58) 140 COPY NO.   ^8th July, 1958CABINETFACILITIES IN THE UNITED kingdom for UNITED STATES NAVAL forces memorandum by the Minister of defence the United States Government have asked our agreement inprinciple to their basing on this country the following naval and air forces,starting late in 1960:-(a) six radar picket frigates;(b) a number of naval patrol and early warning aircraft,amounting to three squadrons; and(c) a submarine depot ship and a squadron of Hunter/Killersubmarines.-2. The ships would be based on a northern port and would useconsiderable British facilities.   They would be charged the full costof these facilities, including Departmental expenses and any other overheads.3. The Defence Committee consider   that the acceptance of theAmerican request would have military advantages.4. In global war, these ships and aircraft would come underNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) command.   In order to minimise any risk that, while they were still under American nationalcommand, i. e. , in a situation short of global war, they might without our knowledge or consent become involved in warlike operations, weshould have to stipulate that any American naval vessels or maritimeaircraft based on this country should not be used for warlike operationswithout the prior agreement of Her Majesty&apos;s Government unless theyhad previously been brought under N.A.T.O. command and were thereforeacting in accordance with approved Allied plans.   It would of course benecessary to accept that such a rule could not be expected to apply ifthe ships or aircraft were forced to defend themselves in the face of attack, or threatened attack, by surface vessels, submarines or aircraft of the Soviet bloc.5. Subject to this stipulation and to the settlement of satisfactoryadministrative and financial arrangements, I recommend that the cabinet should agree in principle to the American request and authorise theDepartments concerned to discuss its practical implications with theUnited States Service authorities.D. S.Ministry of Defence, S. W.l.7th July, 1958
