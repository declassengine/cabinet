C,(58) 114 COPY NO.20th May, 1958CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA:  ORIGIN PROBLEMSWeno memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the proposal that the Faymaster-General should be givenlatitude to negotiate within the limits laid down in paragraph 16 of thereport of officials annexed to C.(58) 110, in dealing with origin problems arising in &quot;the Free Trade Area negotiations, has been considered by a group of Ministers under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, andalso by the Economic policy Committee.2.      The Committee agreed that no indication should be given inEurope, even of a non-committal character, of our willingness to move in this direction until the Commonwealth had been consulted.   Theprocess of consultation should begin at the meeting of Commonwealthofficials which is due to start in London on 2nd June.   It was recognisedthat there might be some attractions in holding the matter over, in viewof the implications which it might hold for some aspects of theCommonwealth preference system, until;l Commonwealth ministers could be consulted at the September Conference in Montreal.    But theCommittee felt that the complexity of the problem made it desirable for it to be discussed in the first instance with Commonwealth officials;moreover, to defer any move in Europe until after September would soreduce the momentum of the negotiations as to bring about their collapse.3.      The Committee therefore felt that, subject to there being no significant opposition from the Commonwealth in June, and subject toany major constitutional developments which might take place in France,the Paymaster-General should have latitutde, on receiving the promisedcounter-proposals of the Six Fowers, to respond along the lines set outin the report annexed to C.(58) 110.4.      Particular points to which the Committee addressed themselveswere:-(a)     They agreed that the limits set out in paragraph 16 of the reportof officials should be regarded as firm sticking points, even if thisentailed a breakdown of the negotiations.   They regarded the main pointsas being :-(i)    maintenance of Commonwealth free entry;-1-
(ii)    insistence on the negotiation regarding external tariffs on basic materials resulting in low or aero levels -i.e. the United Kingdom should not be forced to raiseany tariff significantly.   In practice it was thoughtunlikely that there would be much pressure to raisetariff levels except in very rare cases;(iii)    refusal to accept tariff harmonisation or &quot;compensationtaxes in lieu&quot; on manufactured goods, except as apossible means of dealing with particular cases of difficulty to which regular origin rules could not be effectively applied.   It was recognised that case would need to be taken in the negotiations to ensure that thepossible area of application of compensation taxes couldnot subsequently be widened by means of a two-thirds majority in the institutions of the Free Trade Area.(b) They agreed that it would be necessary to discuss withrepresentatives of British industry the direction in which we would,if pressed, be prepared to make a move.   It would also be desirableto give similar information, in due course, to representatives ofthe National Farmers&apos; Unions and the Trades Union Congress.   Inthe consultations with industry, which might appropriately be undertaken by the President of the Board of Trade and the Paymaster-General,it would be necessary to discuss in particular any difficulties whichmight arise from:-(i)    the harmonisation of basic material tariffs at low or -zerolevels;(ii)    the need for exceptional methods for settling particularorigin problems - engineering components, chemicals,textiles and some manufactures (where basic materialtariffs were not harmonised);(iii)    the likelihood in any case, whether or not we moved from our present position, that we should now be unable tosettle permanently all the origin questions before theConvention was signed.(c) They agreed that the presentation of the matter to theCommonwealth would need to be carefully considered.    particular points which should be stressed were:-(i)    the economic advantages which would accrue to theCommonwealth generally from easier access to an expanding European market for their products;(ii)    the impossibility of securing an effective Free trade area if we were not prepared to move, if pressed,in this direction;2-
(iii) the damage which might be done to the Commonwealth^economic interests if the Free Trade Area negotiationsbroke down on this issue, and the tightly organisedCommon Market of the &quot;Six&quot; were not supplemented by a Free Trade Area;(iv) the possibility of losses of individual preferences by independent Commonwealth countries and the Colonies:a separate paper on this point is being circulated tothe Cabinet by the Paymaster-General.D.H.a treasury Chambers, S.W.I.20th May, 1958-3-
