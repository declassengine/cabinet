Printed for the Cabinet. June 1958C. (58) 136 Copy No.30th June, 1958CABINETPRISON reform memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy seal the State of the PrisonsI feel that I must bring the state of the prisons to the notice of my colleaguesbecause I am satisfied that we cannot defend the present position and must takevigorous action to remedy it. The case for such action is strengthened by thealarming increase in crime. That alone compels us to show that we are exertingourselves.2. The constructive contribution that our prisons can make is to prevent thelargest possible number of those committed to their care from offending again.Since the report of the Gladstone Committee in 1895 it has been accepted,at least in principle, that this end will not be reached by a harsh and repressiveregime designed simply to deter through fear. The object must be, in the words of that committee, to send the prisoners out &quot; better men and women, morally,mentally and physically, than when they came in.&quot;For a generation past our prisons have sought increasingly to give practical effect to these conceptions. This development received a fresh impetus when inthe Criminal Justice Act, 1948, and the Prison Rules made thereunder Parliamentspecifically accepted this view of the function of the prison and laid it as a duty onthe Prison Commissioners to give effect to it.3. Since then much progress has been made in many directions, and I shouldnot wish it to be thought that I believe our prison system, as a whole, to be inferiorin imagination, humanity or efficiency to other comparable systems, or that it haslacked success in achieving the results it seeks in diverting offenders from crime.But the position now is that owing to the great increase in prison population in thelast year or so, and to the effect of financial restrictions, not only is further progressretarded but we face a situation which may well become a matter of public criticismfor reasons which I will now give.4. In spite of the development of specialised prisons and of an extensive openprison system, the great majority of men sentenced to imprisonment who are notserving a first sentence have to serve their sentences in the local prisons the formercounty gaols in grossly overcrowded conditions and without adequate facilitiesfor work or training.Of some 15,000 men now serving sentences of imprisonment only about 4,000(of whom over 3,000 are serving first sentences) are in central or regional or openprisons. Under the Rules, recidivists with sentences of over 3 years should go toa central prison, but since Dartmoor is still the only central prison available forthis category, it is necessary in practice to fix 5 years as the minimum sentence to qualify and even such a man must wait in a local prison for over 20 months before he can get to Dartmoor.53646
5. These local prisons, holding more prisoners than they have ever held before, now have to house nearly 5,000 men sleeping three in a single cell. Anyof my colleagues who have visited prisons, especially in the early morning, can obtain a clear Dickensian view of what this means. These local prisons are in themselves quite unsuited to modern conceptions of penal treatment, built as theywere ICO years or more ago to serve the purpose of solitary confinement, treadmillhard labour, and brutal repression. They stand as a monumental denial of theprinciples to which we are committed.The difficulties of the local prisons are accentuated by the fact that they housenot only men sentenced to imprisonment but many other classes of prisoner. Thereare men and boys awaiting trial or on remand; men imprisoned for failure to pay their debts or to maintain their wives; young prisoners with sentences of less than three months; borstal inmates awaiting transfer to a borstal reception centre; andpreventive detention prisoners and corrective trainees awaiting transfers to central and training prisons. The continual changes in the population, with ail the workwhich this involves for the staff, and the need to segregate different classes ofprisoner make it very difficult to give any form of positive training.6. Apart from the gross overcrowding of this very mixed population inunsuitable buildings, another serious disadvantage from which these local prisonssuffer is shortage of work. Not only is it difficult to find orders for work for therapidly increasing numbers, but there is now a positive shortage of workshop space,so that in fact the Prison Commissioners have been unable to tender for suitablecontracts because they have not the shop capacity to carry them out. Nothing ismore demoralising than idleness in an overcrowded prison. Such conditions willnot make men better citizens; they will grind them down and make them worse.What Needs to be Done7. One way of relieving the difficulties of the prison administration is to findmeans of reducing the number of persons who are sent to prison. The recentlegislation relating to maintenance orders and the imprisonment of first offenderswill help in this, and I am considering whether legislation should be introduced toincrease the level of fines, which might then more often be regarded as an adequatealternative to imprisonment. But the effect of such measures can be marginalonly and we have no reason to expect from them any dramatic reduction in the prison population. Indeed the likelihood is that it will increase. In the pasteighteen months the number of offenders under 21 serving sentences of borsialtraining or imprisonment has increased by nearly 40 per cent, from 3,400 at theend of 1956 to 4,700 in June 1958. This augurs ill for the future. There is no reasonto expect that this trend will be reversed; indeed it is likely to be accelerated, asthe high birth-rate in the years after the war begins to affect the 16-21 age-group.There have also been increases in every other type of prisoner so that the total population in prisons, borstals and detention centres has risen from about 20,500two years ago to over 25,000.   This is the highest figure in this century.8. It is therefore only reasonable to look at the pattern of the prison system for the next few years on the assumption that it will have to deal with a populationof the present size or larger, and with an increasingly large element in it of young offenders. If it is to do so effectively, three basic needs will have to be satisfied.They are:  (a) adequate facilities for the examination of prisoners charged with offences,so that the courts may be properly advised on the choice of treatment,combined with adequate arrangements for examination andclassification after sentence;(b) adequate and suitably equipped buildings in which to treat adult offendersafter sentence;(c) a specialised system of treatment for all young offenders, based on are-assessment of the present systems provided by law, i.e., detention centres, imprisonment and borstal training.9. The building programme at present approved is clearly inadequate to meet these needs. It provides for one remand and observation centre, two secureprisons, one of which has just been completed, one psychiatric prison, four secureborstals for boys and one for girls, and two detention centres, and for the adaptation of a number of redundant service establishments and other propertiesfor use as open prisons and borstals.   We shall need much more than this.
Examination of Persons Charged with Offences and Classification of Offenders10. We need five or six additional remand and observation centres. the criminal Justice Act, 1948, provided for the establishment of remand centres for young persons. None has so far been set up, and this is a source of continualcriticism in Parliament. With these we must associate similar centres for adults.Without these centres we cannot provide the courts with the information they require in order to choose the right kind of sentence; and we cannot ourselvesexamine and classify adult prisoners after sentence as we are able to do in thecase of borstal boys. The over-worked governors of local prisons do make reports to the courts on the suitability of offenders for borstal training, corrective training and preventive detention; but they cannot give each case the attention it deserves,and the courts may decide upon a sentence which they would consider unsuitable ifthey had fuller information. After sentence we have at present no machinery for determing the best form of treatment to be given to adults who are sentenced to imprisonment.   It is high time that we had.Accommodation for the Treatment of Adult Offenders11. What we have to do first of all is to build new accommodation, with adequate facilities for all forms of personal and industrial training, to enable us totake out of the local prisons about 2,000 long-term prisoners who ought not to bethere. This would relieve the pressure on the overcrowded local prisons and wecould then gradually recondition them., A shorter-term plan for the expansionof workshop facilities is also an urgent need. Unless we take these steps wecannot hope to deal effectively and in accordance with modern ideas with thosewho are being sentenced in such large numbers to imprisonment.Treatment of Young Offenders12. Here we have two inter-related problems to consider that of the approach to training and that of the accommodation in which training is to beprovided.13. At present, young offenders sentenced to detention are sent to detention centres, to a borstal, or to prison. I am, at the moment, consulting the AdvisoryCouncil on the Treatment of Offenders about possible changes in this system. Themain effect would be to replace the present law governing the treatment of young offenders by provisions which would put at the disposal of the courts three types of training. The first would be detention for a period not exceeding six months in a detention centre; the second would be a period of intermediate detention ofnot less than six months and not more than two years; and the third^which wouldbe used only in exceptional cases, would be imprisonment for a period of threeyears or more. I do not want to trouble my colleagues at the moment with thearguments which support these proposals. The main one is that the presentdistinction between borstal training and imprisonment for young offenders is being found to be an increasingly artificial one; and there is also, in the view of thosewho have most experience of borstal training, a tendency to keep a boy in detentionfor too long a period and so, incidentally, to add to the strain on accommodation.14. The amount of accommodation required for young persons sentenced to detention will depend to some extent on the outcome of the consideration whichis being given to these proposals. It is clear, however, that a great deal must bedone. There are at present only four detention centres and plans for two more.Another six are required. Over large parts of the country this method of treatment,of which the usefulness is not in doubt, cannot be ordered by the courts becauseaccommodation is not available. As regards buildings for the intermediate and long-term detention of young offenders it will be necessary, on the most favourableassumption, to provide secure establishments to accommodate about 1,000 persons(which is included in the present programme) and open establishments for about thesame number.Scale of the Building Problem15. To sum up our building proposals, we need in addition to the programme already agreed (paragraph 9):  (a) Five or six remand centres.(b) Six detention centres.
(c) Six new secure prisons to accommodate 2,000 men.(ci) Additional open establishments for young offenders and adults adaptedfrom redundant service camps, &amp;c.(e) A long-term programme of reconditioning and modernisation in existinglocal prisons, and the replacement of Dartmoor by a modern prison.This would involve a much enlarged building programme, the cost and timing ofwhich I would propose to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.White Paper on Penal Reform16. It is now ten years since the passage of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948,which was based on the proposals contained in legislation promoted by a conservative Government in 1938. A review of the progress made since 1948 andof the Governments proposals for further advance in this field, including theproposals in this memorandum, would not only demonstrate the Governmentsconcern with this important and growing social problem; it would chart the course which we ought to follow in the future. I propose, therefore, to prepare and submit for the consideration of my colleagues a draft of a White Paper which might bepublished in the autumn. There is bound, as my colleagues realise, to be a demandfor new legislation dealing not only with reforms which have already been recommended by Royal Commissions and Departmental committees or which forother reasons are seen to be desirable, but giving effect also to some of the newideas to which I have referred in the course of this paper and to others such aschanges in the system of preventive detention which are still the subject ofdiscussion. If, as seems quite likely, major legislation on such matters is not appropriate next session, I regard it as of first importance that our ideas shouldbe clearly and authoritatively set out in the form of a White Paper, of which theproposals can be implemented as opportunity offers. The publication of a paper would not itself determine the exact date of legislation. Such a paper by itself would be valuable, since it would elicit the views of outside persons and bodies andenlist their interest and support.17. Indeed our experience with education showed that the White Papereffectively prepared public opinion for the reforms we envisaged and enabled usto carry them out, to the benefit of education and to the lasting credit of theadministration of the time and its successors.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,26th June, 1958.
