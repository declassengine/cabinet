Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 134 Copy No. 6 027th June, 1958CABINETEGYPT: COMPENSATION FOR BRITISH PROPERTYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 13th May the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Chancellor of the  Exchequer, to examine the means by which any lump sum payment by theEgyptian Government would best be distributed among individual claimants to compensation (C.C. (58) 41st Conclusions, Minute 8).2. This problem has now been considered and discussed with the foreign compensation Commission, and my conclusions, with which the Chancellor agrees,are set out below. They are based on the assumption that a lump sum wouldbe of the order of  25-30 millions, that there would be at least a substantial proportion of it available in cash at the outset, and that it would be availablefor distribution to compensate both those whose property has been Egyptianisedor expropriated and those who receive their property back damaged.3. There are several recent precedents for lump sum distributions. Since thewar agreements have been concluded with Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland,Bulgaria and Hungary, providing for payment of compensation for losses byBritish nationals in those countries through, inter alia, nationalisation andexpropriation. Under the Foreign Compensation Act, 1950, provision may bemade by means of Orders in Council for the determination by the foreign compensation Commission set up under the Act, of claims to participate in such compensation, and for its distribution amongst persons whose claims have beenestablished. There are no legal or practical impediments to the use of the foreign compensation Commission in the case of Egypt, and indeed it would be the properinstrument to use.4. In the case of the compensation agreements with the Eastern european countries mentioned above, the Commission^ task is proving a lengthy one. Inthe Polish distribution, for example, about eight months&apos; work by the commission was required before decisions could be taken on any claims. In all these casesthe sum received as compensation from the Governments concerned is but a small proportion of the total claims.5. In the case of Egypt the lump sum would be considerably larger than thosereceived from Eastern European Governments, and the task of distribution more complex because of the great variety of British property in Egypt, and thecomplication that some property will be returned to its owners, but in damagedcondition.6. The &quot; claims &quot; registered in the Foreign Office total some 400 for businesses(including those Egyptianised) and 3,900 for private assets. There will also beclaims (mainly private) from some of the 2,000 United Kingdom and Maltesesubjects still in Egypt, and, perhaps, to a lesser extent from the 3,000 Cypriots.53639
2CONFIDENTIAL2517. In the event of a lump sum settlement there would be considerable pressure in the United Kingdom for the payment of an early dividend to the claimants. this could be arranged. It is normal practice for the Orders in Council made underthe Foreign Compensation Act to enable the Foreign Compensation Commission to ^flPmake interim part payments. The first claims to be established are likely to be those for the expropriation of property &quot; Egyptianised &quot;-mainly the larger businessclaims. Politically the most vocal group of claimants are the owners of sequestratedbusinesses and private property, and delay would be inevitable before their claimscould be determined because the owners would first have to resume possession oftheir property, and then make claims in respect of the damage. The Commissioncan however adapt itself to these circumstances; and in particular as between thetwo main categories of &quot; Egyptianised &quot; property and sequestrated property whichis returned, it should be possible after an interval of say six months to make a rough estimate of what proportion of the lump sum is likely to be required for eachcategory and divide it accordingly. This would enable interim payments to bemade in either category and would also make it possible (if it were desired) to paydifferent rates of dividend.8. The likely sequence of events would be as follows. Such preparatory work as is possible has already been put in hand to save time should a lump sumdistribution be required. Soon after an agreement is reached with the Egyptians,an Order in Council (which would be subject to the &quot; negative-resolution&quot;procedure) could be made under which claimants would submit applications to theCommission; the Order would also deal generally with the questions of eligibilityand the types of claims to be compensated from the lump sum which had beenreceived. After, say, six months a further Order in Council could be made, dividingup the lump sum for distribution to the two main categories (Egyptianised andsequestrated) and authorising interim payments. Within the following monthsdividends could be paid to both classes of claimants. It would probably take several years before the last payments were made.9. The expenses of the Foreign Compensation Commission would, as isprovided for under the Foreign Compensation Act, be recoverable out of the lump sum of compensation received. The Commission would need extra staff for theEgyptian distribution as they are already fully occupied with Eastern Europeandistributions. They would also need to be in close touch with officials working in her Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Cairo, who could report on evidence obtainable in Egyptconcerning claims made to the Commission.10. The task of the Commission would be further complicated if it were decided that from the sums they were to distribute Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould recover advances made through the ex-gratia loan scheme of the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board, under which loans of up to 70 per cent, of the declared value of personal tangible assets in Egypt have been made. But theCommission consider that they could cope with this complication.11. A complicating factor in the speedy distribution of compensation may,however, be caused if the Tribunals and Inquiries Bill becomes law in its present form. Clause 10 of this Bill would remove from the Foreign CompensationCommission the protection it at present enjoys under Clause 4(4) of the foreign compensation Act 1950, which states that the determination by the Commissionof any application made to them under the Act &quot; shall not be called in question in any court of law.&quot; The Commission might find its work seriously complicated and delayed, should claimants be able to take certiorari proceedings. this situation could be met by an amendment to the Bill. I am pursuing this questionseparately.12. In conclusion, I believe that the distribution of a lump sum ofcompensation from the Egyptian Government could be undertaken by the foreign compensation Commission. It would be a big and complicated task, particularly if its operations were hampered by the consequences of the Tribunals Bill, but one towhich the Commission could adapt itself, bearing in mind particularly thedesirability of making early interim payments. The problem of distribution needtherefore be no obstacle to our acceptance of a lump sum if it is offered by the egyptians. LForeign Office, S.W. I,26th June, 1958.
