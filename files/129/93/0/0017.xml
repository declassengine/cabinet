The Icelandic Government have claimed with effect from.......a further extension of their exclusive fishery limits.     Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided that protection will be given to british fishing vessels fishing on the high seas outside the four-mile limit as measured from the baselines claimed by Iceland before the IcelandicDeclaration of ,   1958.     Protection can only be given tofishing vessels in specified areas.     Details of these areas will besent to you separately.Z.      In accordance with the provisions of the instructions set out inthe following paragraphs, you are to use your utmost endeavours toprevent the arrest of British fishing vessels on these high seas, andto secure the release of any such vessel which has been arrested.3.      The use of force should, if possible, be avoided, and force should only be used after force has been used by the Icelanders either in boarding a vessel or otherwise.4.      No more force should be used than is necessary to prevent the arrest or to secure the release of a fishing vessel.5.      If a fishing vessel has been arrested by Icelanders, H. M. shipmay seek to board her and so to release her, and if a tow rope has beenattached, to break the tow.6.      If an Icelandic boarding party seeks to take in a fishing vesselunder its own power and it is not possible for H. M. ship to board her,the fishing vessel should be ordered to heave to and if necessary ablank warning shot may be fired across her bows.7.      If a British vessel is being towed and it is not possible to board her, the towing vessel may be ordered to heave to and ifnecessary a blank warning shot may be fired across her bows.     under no circumstances should a shot be fired at an Icelandic or Britishvessel.8.      Since Thor is understood to be the only Icelandic vessel capableof taking trawlers in tow, she should be shadowed closely in order toprevent her making arrests.9.      In boarding operations, firearms should not be used/&quot;unlessthe Icelanders use them first/7.10.      If live shot is fired at a fishing vessel or one of H. M. ships,that vessel should immediately withdraw and an immediate report should be made to the Admiralty.-1-INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CAPTAIN OF the fishery PROTECTION SQUADRON
11. In carrying out the preceding instructions you should bear inmind that there is no right of hot pursuit from the high seas into theterritorial sea. You should therefore not follow an arrested vesselwithin the four-mile limit or seek to secure her release when she is within that limit.12.     Trawler owners are being requested to instruct their skippersto co-operate to the maximum degree.    A copy of these draft instructions to skippers is being sent to you separately.
ANNEX BICELANDIC FISHERY LIMITSINSTRUCTIONS TO SKIPPERS OF BRITISH FISHERYVESSELSHer Majesty&apos;s Government desire to give as much protection aspossible to British fishing vessels operating on the high seas in theareas now for the first time claimed by Iceland as within their exclusivefisheries limits.     It will not, however, be possible to give effective protection unless fishing vessels co-operate, when within such waters,by fishing only in areas specified by Captains of British Fishery ProtectionVessels.2.        Skippers should report their arrival and departure from thegrounds.     For their own protection they should keep in close touch withthe Captain of the nearest Fishery Protection Vessel and comply with any instructions he may give.3.         If any vessels fish outside the areas specified they will do soat their own risk.4. Under no circumstances should fishing vessels attempt to operate within the limits claimed by Iceland in 1952 or so close to thoselimits that it could be argued that they were within them.5.        When an Icelandic gunboat is sighted, her position and course should be reported immediately to the nearest British Fishery ProtectionVessel.     Fishing should be continued and any instructions from the icelandic gunboat should be ignored.     The nearest British fishery protection Vessel will seek to prevent the Icelandic gunboat from arrestingthe fishing vessel or otherwise interfering with her operations, and seek to secure the release of the vessel if arrested.6.        In the event of an attempt being made by the Icelandic gunboatto put a boarding party on board the British fishing vessel, the skippershould protest vigorously and seek to prevent his vessel from beingboarded, arrested or towed.    On no account should he permit the useof firearms or explosives.7.        In order to gain time for the arrival of one of H. M. ships, heshould seek to delay the Icelandic operations as much as possible and tothat end he should, if need be, immobilise the engines by removing andhiding an easily replaceable part, unless this endangers the safety ofthe vessel and its crew.8.        To prevent a fishing vessel being boarded by Icelanders or tosecure its release after it has been boarded, the B ritish fishery protection Vessel may put some of her crew on board the vessel.9.         Signals by Icelandic Fishery Protection aircraft should not beobeyed but should be reported immediately to the nearest BritishFishery Protection Vessel.
