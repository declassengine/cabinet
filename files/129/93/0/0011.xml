COPY NO.cabinet government expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of tha Exchequerf am anxious to keep my colleagues informed from time totime of the cumulative effect, both on this year&apos;s expenditure andon expenditure in future years, of various decisions which havebeen, or may be, taken by the Government.     In this way I hopewe can avoid the sudden emergence of a critical situation in whichthe Cabinet have to ask for drastic economies shortly before theEstimates have to be settled.     Many of the figures are purelyprovisional at this stage.     More up-to-date figures will become available during the next month or two.2. The starting point is provided by this year&apos;s publishedEstimates for Supply expenditure.     They totalled  4,259 millions as compared with an out-turn of  4,138 millions in 1957-5G.   Of the 4,259 millions,  1,418 millions was Defence (this assumed  47 millionssupport costs), and  2,841 millions Civil.3.         Forecast Estimates of   Civil expenditure so far receivedby the Treasury from Departments for the next two years show anincrease, as compared with 1958-59, of about  100 millions for1959-60, and about  170 millions for 1960-61.     The principal changesforecast for 1959-60 are increases of about  17 millions for roads,about  95 millions for social services (of which about  35 millions isfor education), and a decrease of  27 millions for the Atomic energy authority   whose capital programme will have passed its peak.    Thefurther changes forecast for 1960-61 show roughly the  same pattern.4. These forecasts are based on the same assumptions as the1958-59 Estimates, that is, in general they assume existing policies and no change in the level of wages, prices and other costs from thelevel obtaining at the end of 1957.     They make no allowance for -(i)   any change in the present level of agricultural subsidies;(ii)   any difference in .  amount between the new general grant to local authorities and the total of the specific grants which wouldbe paid without it;(iii)   any change in the National Insurance Scheme.They exclude Post Office voted expenditure on the assumption thatit will continue to be at least self-balancing.C.(58) HI16th May, 1958(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5. No similar forecast is yet available for Defence expenditure,and I use for 1959-60 and 1960-61 - simply as an arbitrary startingfigure - the 1958-59 total of  1,465 millions (i. e. with no provisionfor support costs) though, in fact, the Minister of Defence and I bothhope that we can improve on this figure in the next two years.    work is at present in progress to produce a properly considered forecast.(I have also proposed to the Minister of Defence an alteration in thescope of the Defence Budget, but this is merely re-classificationas between Defence and Civil expenditure, which makes no difference to the total figures.)6.         V/e therefore have the following provisional position asat March 1958:-1957-58 1958-59 1959-60 1960-61Outturn Estimate Forecast Forecast  millions   millions   millions   millions413 8 4259 4400 44807. Since the Estimates for the current year and forecasts for the next two years were prepared, a number of new developments have occurred.   Their net effect is to increase the 1958-59 figuresabove by rather over  40 millions, and to reduce the 1959-60 and1960-61 figures by  15-20 millions.     The details are in the appendix.I hope that some of the additional expenditure in prospect can bemet by economies in existing Estimates, but I have not included any increases in regard to which firm and specific assurances havebeen given of countervailing economies.8. There are a number of other possibilities, for exam pie :-(a) Assistance to Small farmers.     The minister&apos;s proposals intheir present form would cost about  15 millions a year, of which atleast. 5 millions would be &quot;new money&quot;, the rest, it is hoped, beingrecouped by further reductions in guaranteed prices.   This would affect Estimates from next year onwards.(b) Advances in Education. The Minister has a number of proposalswhich might, I understand, cost about. 6 millions a year.(c) Cyprus.    Emergency expenditure might cost us  3-4 millions over the next two years.(d) No account has been taken of the effect on the National insurance fund of any increase in unemployment above 1. 6 per cent either thisyear or later.   The present rate is just over 2 per cent.   An average rate of 2 per cent during a year would add about  15 millions per annum,and an average rate of 3 per cent would add about  45 millions per annum, to the deficit assumed in the forecasts.(e) A Committee is to be appointed to review the system of university awards.     Proposals for extra expediture may result.(f) Nothing is included for any increase in public service salariesor wages.
(i)   The pay of doctors and dentists is being reviewed by a royal Commission.   The cost to the Exchequer of every 1 per cent increase in pay would be just under  1 millions per annum.(ii)   Claims are in for teachers.     The cost to the Exchequer ofevery 1 per cent increase in pay would be about  1. 7 millions per annum.(iii)   Various Civil Service claims are under review.   It is believethat comparison with present outside rates may be found to justify an increase for clerks which would cost about  5 millions a year.Y\e need not assume the worst on all these possibilities, but itis clearly probable that they v/ill between them lead, during thenext two years, to material additions to the figures in paragraphs and 7 above.9. The situation would of course be greatly changed by any marked increase in present costs; or by any measures of a&quot;reflationary&quot; kind which affected expenditure above the line.10.        My conclusion   is that if we are to contain government expenditure during the remainder of this Parliament and have any chance of further tax reductions, we must continue to adopt a very severe attitude to proposals for further expenditure unaccompaniedby corresponding savings.11.         I shall report again to my colleagues when further figuresbecome available.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.16th May, 1958
