Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 135 Copy No.27th June, 1958CABINETSUEZ CANAL SURCHARGEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Secretary-General of the United Nations intends to issue shortly, possiblyat the end of this week, an announcement setting out the arrangements that havebeen made to collect the Suez Canal surcharge. Broadly speaking, theannouncement provides that whoever pays the transit tolls of ships using the suez Canal shall also pay a 3 per cent, surcharge on these tolls to a United Nationscollecting agent. These arrangements are acceptable from our point of view.2. In view of the attitude of British shipowners, supported by theInternational Chamber of Shipping, that shipowners should not pay the surchargeunless fully reimbursed by their Governments, Her Majesty&apos;s Government decided in principle to reimburse United Kingdom toll payers provided that Governmentsof other countries made arrangements to ensure that their toll payers also paid the surcharge.3. The Secretary-General and the Governments concerned have beeninformed of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision. So far, the United States,France, Finland and Japan have assured us of their co-operation. The Germanand Italian Governments will also almost certainly co-operate, and it is hoped that pressure by the United Nations and the United States, coupled with our example,will ensure that the majority of other Governments, in particular those of norway and Sweden, will accept the scheme. The Governments whose flags are used asflags of convenience are unlikely to co-operate. But a high proportion of the surchange due from ships flying these flags will be due for payment by their Britishand American charterers.4. In the United Kingdom only the Chairman of the General Council ofBritish Shipping has been informed of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision. Butonce the Secretary-GeneraFs announcement has been published, it will not bepossible to keep the decision confidential. British toll payers will have to beinformed of the methods by which they will be reimbursed. In addition,Parliamentary interest in the surcharge, which was at one time considerable, will almost certainly be revived.5. The majority of previous Parliamentary Questions were hostile to her majesty&apos;s Governments support for the surcharge. It is therefore important thatthe exact nature of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision, and particularly the factthat Her Majesty&apos;s Governments willingness to reimburse British shipowners is dependent upon the co-operation of other countries in the surcharge scheme, shouldbe made quite clear. I think that the best way of doing this would be for me toarrange for a non-oral question and answer in Parliament. The text of such aquestion and answer is annexed.6. Once the Secretary-GeneraFs bulletin has been issued, Her Majesty&apos;governments statement should be made as soon as possible. I hope, therefore,that my colleagues will agree with the procedure I propose.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,27th June, 1958.53644
ANNEXSUEZ CANAL SURCHARGEProposed Parliamentary Question and answer to ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if he has yet received acopy of the Bulletin published on by the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations, setting out the arrangements that have been made to collecta surcharge to pay for the operation undertaken by the United Nations to clear the Suez Canal, and if he will make a statement.Yes, Sir.  On I received a copy of the Bulletin issued bythe Secretary-General of the United Nations concerning the proposed Suez Canalsurcharge.2. The Bulletin provides that whoever pays the transit tolls of ships using the suez Canal shall pay a surcharge of 3 per cent, of these tolls to the Banque He laSociete General de Belgique which has been designated as the United Nationscollecting agent. The surcharge will continue in force until the United Nationsexpenditure on the clearance of the Canal.has been recovered. It is expected thatthis will be in about three years. The United Nations expenditure concernedincludes the costs of the Anglo-French salvage fleet while it was under the command of the United Nations.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government attach importance to the successful workingof the scheme and they hope that United Kingdom toll-payers will co-operatefully in carrying it out. They have undertaken in principle to reimburse UnitedKingdom shipowners and charterers who pay tolls and details of how this is tobe done are being worked out with the General Council of British Shipping. her majesty&apos;s Governments decision to reimburse is, however, based upon the proviso that other countries concerned, and their shipowners, co-operate in the scheme.Her Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept a position in which the UnitedKingdom was left to pay an excessive share, and accordingly reserve the right to review their decision from time to time in the light of the working of the scheme.4. The Secretary-General and other Governments concerned have beeninformed of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision.
