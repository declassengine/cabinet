Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1958C. (58) 126 Copy No.16th June, 1958CABINETLAW OF THE SEAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it is for consideration whether the four Conventions drawn up by the geneva conference and an Optional Protocol on the settlement of disputes should be signed on behalf of the United Kingdom. I append a summary of the main provisions of the Conventions and Protocol.2.  The Convention and Protocol cover the following subjects:  (a) Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.   ThisConvention contains no definition whatever of the breadth of theTerritorial Sea, on which the Conference failed to reach a decision,and makes no reference to special exclusive fishing zones. It doeshowever contain a number of other important provisions which areof great interest to the United Kingdom.(b) Convention on the High Seas.  This is in general declaratory of existingprinciples of international lav/ relating to the High Seas and as a wholeis satisfactory to the United Kingdom.(c) Convention on Fisheries Conservation. This Convention comprises a newcode of law governing the scientific conservation of the living resourcesof the High Seas with the object of securing international co-operationaimed at securing the maximum sustainable yields of fish and othermarine products.(d) Convention on the Continental Shelf. This has provisions relating to the exploration and exploitation of the Continental Shelf by the coastalState and is generally satisfactory.(e) Optional Protocol concerning the settlement of disputes.  This Protocolenables any State which becomes a party to one or more of the 1958Conventions on the Law of the Sea to accept, for the purpose of disputes arising out of the interpretations or application of any ofthese Conventions and in relation to other States accepting the sameobligation, the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court ofJustice.RecommendationI recommend that the four Conventions and the Optional Protocol shouldbe signed on behalf of the United Kingdom, with a view to ratification in due course.S.

APPENDIX(1) Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone1. The Convention is divided into three parts, and the first part is sub-dividedinto three sections.Territorial Sea: Baselines2. Part I deals with the territorial sea. Section I relates to sovereignty overit, and Section II defines the measurement of it. In Section II there are twocontroversial articles. Article 4 provides for the breadth of the territorial seato be measured, in suitable cases, not from a baseline consisting of the low waterline along the coast, but from straight baselines joining appropriate points. this method of measurement is on the whole unwelcome, but it has the sanction of theInternational Court of Justice in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries case, and wemust accept that the principle of the use of straight baselines in appropriate caseshas now become a part of international law. Given that the principle must beaccepted, the detailed provisions of Article 4 are generally satisfactory, thoughit had been hoped at the Conference to obtain an additional provision establishing a limit on the length of any one straight baseline. The provision in paragraph 4of this Article that &quot; account may be taken of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned&quot; is founded on the Norwegian Fisheries case; it is to be understood that the application of the straight baseline system should be justifiedin principle on other grounds before purely local economic considerations couldjustify a particular way of drawing baselines. Although it is considered that thisArticle should be accepted, it could perhaps be used in the future as the basis of claims by other countries which could lead to difficulties and disputes.Bays3. The second controversial article is Article 7 concerning bays. Theprinciple of drawing closing lines across the mouth of deep indentations so as tomake the area thereby enclosed internal waters is acceptable to us. In order toprevent abuse we had hoped to obtain at the Conference a ruling that the closingline must be a short one, e.g., 10 miles. The Conference accepted the idea of a limit on the justifiable length of the closing line but adopted a length of 24 miles(Article 7 (iv)). However, such a length creates no intolerable difficulties, and it iscertainly the best we can hope to get.4. Paragraph 6 of this Article excepts from its rules &quot; historic &quot; bays. TheConference decided that claims to sovereignty over large areas of sea on the groundthat they were &quot; historic&quot; bays needed further examination, and adopted aresolution to that effect.  The text is at Appendix B.5. For the rest, it is satisfactory that the rules for delimiting the territorial sea (apart from its breadth) should be set out in terms which are reasonably clear.Innocent Passage6. Part I, Section III, deals with the right of innocent passage through theterritorial sea in terms which are satisfactory. Article 14 provides that ships ofall States shall enjoy the right of innocent passage, which is defined as a passagenot prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. the coastal State must not hamper innocent passage but may take steps to preventpassage which is not innocent; it may suspend temporarily in specified areas theinnocent passage of foreign ships for the protection of its security but there may,be no suspension of innocent passage through international straits, i.e., straitsconnecting one part of the high seas and another part of the high seas or theterritorial sea of a foreign State. The last phrase guarantees innocent passage to places such as Hong Kong and Singapore. The Convention contains noclause requiring prior authorisation or notification for the passage of warships;a provision to this effect which was included in the draft Articles failed to securethe necessary two-thirds majority in the final plenary session.
Arrest of Persons and Ships7. Article 19 deals with the arrest of persons and the conduct of investigations,on board foreign ships passing through the territorial sea, in connection withcrimes committed on board during the passage. Article 20 deals with the arrest of and levying of execution against ships passing through the territorial sea.These Articles are satisfactory, but Article 19 will require legislation in respectof England and Wales. Article 20 permits the arrest of ships in circumstances in which it is prohibited by the Administration of Justice Act, 1956 and the BrusselsConvention of 1952, but Article 25 contains a saving for existing Conventionsas between States parties to them.Contiguous Zone8. Part II deals with the contiguous zone, i.e., a zone extending not morethan twelve miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial seais measured, in which the coastal State may exercise control to prevent or punishinfringements of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary regulations within its territory or territorial sea. This principle has long been claimed by the UnitedStates and other countries, and was formally conceded by the United kingdom in 1952. (See C. (52) 169 of 21st May, 1952.) Its actual application may causeinconvenience to about six Colonial territories, the approaches to which areshared with foreign countries.Final Articles9. Part 111 contains the final Articles. No provision is made for reservations.Recommendation10. Despite the lack of any rule on the breadth of the territorial sea and thelimit of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction, the provisions of this Convention aregenerally advantageous to the United Kingdom and are certainly better thanarrangements we have been faced with in some countries or may be faced within the future if the Convention is not generally adopted.(2) Convention on the High Seas11. Article 2 confirms the freedom of the seas. Article 3 provides that land-locked States should have free access to the sea, but the arrangements for free access are left for negotiation with the States lying between the land-lockedState and the sea.12. Articles 4 to 9 deal with the nationality of shipping. Article 5 inparticular touches on the burning question of flags of convenience. It providesthat each State shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships and for the right to fly its flag. The most controversial part of the Article is the sentence which requires a &quot; genuine link &quot; between the State and the ship, whichis a reference to the flags of convenience now flown by a substantial part of theworld&apos;s tonnage. No attempt is made in the Article to define a genuine linkexcept for the provision that &quot; in particular the State must effectively exercisejurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over shipsflying its flag.&quot; There is no provision for a sanction, the wording &quot; for purposesof recognition of the national character of the ship by other States &quot; having beendeleted from the draft by the Conference.13. The second paragraph of the Article provides that each State shall issue to ships entitled to fly its flag documents to that effect; the Conference eliminatedfrom the original draft words which might have been taken to mean that the documents were to be conclusive evidence of the right to fly the flag and therefor of the existence of a genuine link.14. On balance, Article 5 is considered to be reasonably satisfactory.Anything stronger might have led to serious difficulties with the United Statesand other countries and might have caused embarrassment to our own shipping industry and also to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation by reason ofthe intra-Commonwealth arrangements relating to the registration of ships. Onthe other hand, any material weakening of the original draft would have beenresented by some of our friends in Western Europe (especially the Scandinavians)53612
and by the Seafarers&apos; Unions, who have always played a prominent part in the campaign against flags of convenience; at the same time it is important to note,and it may be necessary to remind some of our European friends and the Seafarers&apos;Unions, that Article 5 does no more than establish the genuine link as a general principle in international law and that the utmost care would need to be exercisedif there were any question of using it for the purposes of any specific actionagainst flags of convenience.15. Article 10 deals with safety at sea. The terms of the Article were suggested jointly by the United Kingdom and Netherlands delegations.16. Article 11 deals with penal and disciplinary measures in matters ofcollision. Paragraph 2, which was inserted with the support of the UnitedKingdom delegation, provides that the State which has issued a master&apos;s certificateor a certificate of competence or licence shall alone be competent to pronouncethe withdrawal of such a certificate even if the holder is not a national of that state. The existing provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts and of theCommonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement, 1931, which enable oneCommonwealth country to cancel or suspend a certificate of competence issuedby another, will be safeguarded by Article 30 of the Convention which providesthat the provisions of the Convention shall not affect conventions or other international agreements already in force, as between States parties to them.This has the same effect as a reservation on the subject of these Commonwealtharrangements which was made by the United Kingdom delegation in connectionwith the relevant Brussels Convention of 1952. Article 11 is not in conflict withthat Convention. The Article only applies to the high seas and does not affectcollisions in the territorial sea or in internal waters.17. Article 12 concerns the rendering of assistance in accidents at sea. Thesecond paragraph, which was added at the suggestion of the Danish delegation,provides that every coastal State shall promote the establishment and maintenanceof an adequate and effective search and rescue service regarding safety on and overthe sea and where circumstances so require by way of mutual regionalarrangements co-operate with neighbouring States for this purpose. This is insufficiently general terms to obviate any need for new administrative arrangementsor legislation and it safeguards adequately the position of existing organisations not directly operated by the States (e.g., the Lifeboat Service in the United Kingdom).The Article is not in conflict with the Brussels Convention of 1910 on Assistance andSalvage at Sea.18.   Articles 13 to 22 deal in satisfactory terms with the slave trade and piracy.19. Article 23 is concerned with the right of hot pursuit on the high seas,commencing from territorial waters or the contiguous zone of vessels which haveviolated the laws and regulations of the coastal State. Pursuit starting from thecontiguous zone is, however, limited to cases where there has been a violation ofthe rights for the protection of which that zone was established. Certain provisionsof this Article would facilitate interference with our deep-sea fishing vessels whereterritorial waters are in dispute, but the risk is one we have to accept.20. Articles 24 and 25 deal with pollution by oil and radioactivity. In dealingwith Article 25 the Conference adopted two resolutions, the texts of which areincluded in Appendix B. One deals with nuclear tests on the high seas, the otherwith pollution of the high seas by radioactive material. The two Articles, and theresolutions, are reasonably harmless from our point of view, and there is noconflict with the International Convention on the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.21. Articles 26 to 29 deal with submarine cables and pipelines. The Articlesare similar to, but less detailed than, some of the Articles of the international convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables of 1884.22. Article 30 specifically provides that the present Convention shall not affectexisting Conventions or other international agreements already in force as betweenthe parties to them. Considerable importance is to be attached to this provision inview of the overlap between certain provisions of their Convention and those ofexisting Conventions.23.   The Convention contains no provision for reservations.
(3) Convention on Fisheries Conservation24. The Convention provides that it shall be the duty of States to adoptconservation measures where required and to frame such measures in agreementwhere States are fishing together. For the United Kingdom these provisions simplyecho our present practice, since all our fisheries are conducted under internationallyagreed conservation measures.25. The Convention also recognises a special interest of the &quot; coastal State &quot; inthe maintenance of the productivity of the living resources in the adjacent high seasand permits such a State to adopt there unilateral measures of conservation which other States shall be required to observe pending the settlement of any disagreementas to their validity. Any such disagreement is to be referred for settlement (failing agreement on recourse elsewhere) to a special commission consisting of &quot; wellqualified persons being nationals of States not involved in the dispute andspecialising in legal, administrative or scientific questions relating to fisheries.....&quot;26. At Geneva these were the contentious provisions. Many of the european states disapproved of the idea of unilateral measures of conservation being taken onthe high seas in advance of approval by an independent and authoritative body, andthis was also the United Kingdom view. Many of the Latin-Americans were opposed to the compulsory settlement of disputes through some kind of arbitralprocedure. These respective provisions were nevertheless adopted by simplemajorities in Committee, and when the draft Convention was considered in plenarymany delegations which had opposed the one or the other provision had come to feel that a reasonable balance had been struck and were prepared to accept theConvention as a whole, which consequently received the necessary two-thirds majority. The United Kingdom delegation took that view after reference to the fishery Ministers and voted in favour of the Convention as a whole.27. The activities of the British deep-sea fishing fleet may at times be prejudiced in particular areas through the imposition of unilateral measures ofconservation under the Convention. There are, however, these importantsafeguards:  (a) The taking of unilateral measures must be preceded by negotiations forwhich six months must be allowed.(b) Any unilateral measures must be based on appropriate scientific findingsand may not discriminate in form or in fact against foreign fishermen.There must also be an urgent need for them.(c) Any State which is affected by unilateral measures may require them to bepronounced upon by a special commission constituted as explained above and appointed by agreement, or in default of agreement by theSecretary-General of the United Nations.(d) The special commission must be constituted within six months and maynot take more than another eight months to reach its decision, whichshall be binding on the disputing States.(e) The special commission may immediately suspend any unilateral measuresif it is satisfied on prima facie evidence that the need for their urgentapplication does not exist.28. These safeguards should mean that a coastal State will not adopt unilateralmeasures of conservation affecting the nationals of other States unless those measures are felt to be reasonably sound and capable of withstanding the scrutiny of independent and expert judgment. Any measures which are adopted would notbe in effect for more than about one year without being adjudicated upon, and any measures which are unwarrantable should not have a life of more than eight ornine months. A country such as Iceland might still manage to interfere unjustifiablywith British fishing activities on the high seas off her shores for a fishing season;but we and the other European States affected have sufficient wealth of scientificknowledge at our command to make it not worth while for Iceland or another toattempt to use these provisions of the Convention in a wrecking manner.29. Moreover, the United Kingdom would not always be the party on the defensive. We have coastal fisheries, and notably for herring, for which there maybe occasion in the future to employ the right of taking unilateral measures ofconservation against certain European States which fish off our shores and are as
yet very loath to accept necessary conservation measures. The interests of theColonies also have to be taken into account and for them, too, the power to takeunilateral measures of conservation may at times be valuable. Lastly, but by nomeans least, the acceptance and operation of an effective code of law on fisheriesconservation should over the years prove a growing influence in restraint of claims to wider areas of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction.(4) Convention on the Continental Shelf30. The United Kingdom has a special interest in respect of the continental shelf lying off the shores of a number of Colonial territories and of the Sheikhdomsin the Persian Gulf; it may also become important for the exploitation of thesea bed surrounding Great Britain and the Channel Islands.31.   The Continental Shelf is defined in Article 1 as:  &quot;.......the sea bed and sub-soil of the submarine areas adjacent to thecoast, but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or,beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas......&quot;By Article 2, the coastal State exercises exclusive sovereign rights of exploration andexploitation of the natural resources of the Shelf; these rights do not depend onoccupation or on any express proclamation. The natural resources include mineral resources, and certain living organisms having a close connection with the Shelf,but exclude swimming fish and swimming Crustacea as the United Kingdom desired.The waters above the Shelf are high seas and are free to all (Article 3).32. Article 5 is concerned with the erection of installations such as oil derricksor artificial islands. Article 6 sets out the principles which are applicable to the delimitation of the Continental Shelf when it is shared by two or more countries as it is in the North Sea and the Persian Gulf and parts of the West Indies.33. There are two points in which the Convention is less than satisfactory tous. The first is in the definition quoted in paragraph 31 above. Since the definitionpermits the exploitation of the sea bed beyond the 200 fathom line it remainsuncertain where the exclusive rights of the coastal State in the sea bed and sub-soilend. Attempts at the Conference to specify a fixed limit, even at a greater depththan 200 metres, failed. In practice, it must be assumed that the 200-metre depthis the outer limit unless the actual exploitation of the sea bed beyond that depth isbegun.34. The second point depends partly on the first. Although the explorationand exploitation of the Continental Shelf by the coastal State must not interferewith fundamental scientific research, Article 5 (8) requires the consent of the coastalState to be obtained in respect of any research undertaken concerning theContinental Shelf, though it should not normally be withheld from pure scientific research sponsored by an institution. This provision, which originated with theFrench and was adopted by a large majority, will be unwelcome to the scientificworld because it could cause inconvenience and delay to scientific research.35. Under Article 12, reservations are permissible to Articles other than 1 to 3.Consideration should be given to the desirability or otherwise of making a reservation to Article 5 (8), the point of difficulty mentioned in paragraph 34 above.There would be objection to doing so because we should not be reserving rightswithin our own jurisdiction, but would be reserving our position in regard to aright conceded by the Convention to other States. As it is desirable to sign all the conventions at an early date, it is recommended that we should not delay signaturewhile this point is examined, but that, if a reservation were decided upon, it shouldbe made at the time of ratification.36. Notwithstanding the two points mentioned in paragraphs 33 and 34, theConvention as a whole is eminently satisfactory.(5) Optional Protocol Concerning the Settlement of Disputes37. The Protocol is not an integral part of any of the 1958 Conventions onthe Law of the Sea. The decision that there should be an Optional Protocol of signature concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes was taken by the
Conference on the Law of the Sea in plenary session, when it became clear that anumber of States would not be prepared to accept, in the Conventions themselves,provisions for the compulsory settlement of disputes, and would make reservationsto such an Article if it were included in one or more of the Conventions.38. The Protocol specifically provides that it does not apply to disputes arising out of Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Convention on Fishing and Conservationof Living Resources of the High Seas to which the arbitration procedure providedfor in that Convention remains applicable.39. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are, in general, prepared to accept thejurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in respect of disputes arising outof the interpretation and application of multilateral Conventions to which theUnited Kingdom is a party.
