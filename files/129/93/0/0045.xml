&apos; i SEC^T 316(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE FR&apos;&quot;FERTY &apos;&quot;&apos;F HER britannic MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 145- r9th July, 1958 C &quot;PY NO,__CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by *he Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy seal in response to the invitation of the Cabinet at their last discussion on this subject (C.C. (58) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 7), the ministerial committee on Pensions have considered the implications of the compromisescheme which the Minister of Pensions has proposed.The nature of the scheme2.     The August Plan replaces the existing flat-rate scheme by a schemeof graduated contributions and benefits.     It makes no provision for contracting out.    And it leaves occupational schemes to adjust themselves as they see fit.3.     The September Plan superimposes a scheme of graduated contributions and benefits on the existing flat-rate scheme.    It provides for contracting out of the superimposed tier in favour of occupational schemes providedthat these satisfy certain criteria as regards equivalence, solvency andtransferability.4.     The compromise scheme amalgamates the August and SeptemberPlans in the sense that it adopts the August Plan as the basis of the new arrangements but allows contracting out (as the original August Plan doesnot) in favour of approved occupational schemes.    Members of contracted out schemes would not pay graduated contributions to the State or receivegraduated benefits but would remain, whatever earnings they draw, boundto contribute and entitled to benefit under the existing flat-rate scheme.The contributions both in the graduated scheme and in the flat-rate scheme are increased at quinquennial intervals.The Pros and Cons5.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer regards the compromise scheme as inferior to the August Plan but superior to the September Plan.    TheMinister of Pensions finds it less acceptable than the Sejotember Plan butpreferable to the August Plan.    But both Ministers, together with their colleagues on the Committee, agree that:-(i)     The new scheme, with a minimum contribution based on the&quot;crossbar&quot; of  8a week at which graduation begins, is rather less favourable to the Exchequer than the August Plan.    But with a  9&quot;crossbar&quot; the gap is materially narrowed.    With either &quot;crossbar&quot; it-1-
becomes more favourable to the Exchequer than the September Plan atsome point in the quinquennium beginning in 1965-66.     The Chancellorof the Exchequer, however, wishes to consider in greater detail the implications of modifying the &quot;crossbar&quot;.(ii) It introduces the principle of contracting out, for which - as was shown by the recent confidential consultations with industry - there is a degree of public support.(iii) It simplifies the administration of contracting out as comparedwith the September Plan.    The latter derived from the conception that,above the flat-rate tier, occ -national schemes were preferable to theState scheme;  and contracting out of the upper tier of the Plan wastherefore designed to be widely available.    But the compromise schemeadopts a different approach - its purpose is to preserve the principle of contracting out from graduated State pensions for those occupational schemes which would be dislocated by an August Plan which incorporatedno such principle.    For this purpose its criteria for contracting outare rather stiffer than under the original September Plan;  and contracting out should therefore take place on a smaller scale, being confined mainly to occupational schemes of substantial size.    As a result the enforce-ment of the criteria should be a simpler matter.    A more detailed noteby the Minister of Pensions on the implications of contracting out underthe compromise is attached at Appendix II.(iv) It eliminates the difficult administrative problem (to which no solution can be seen) of collecting a graduated contribution from the self-employed.    These individuals might have had a legitimategrievance under the August Plan which would have compelled them, atthe higher income levels, to pay a contribution in excess of theirpresent liability, regardless of the provision which they might have chosen to make for themselves.    Under the compromise scheme it will bepossible to treat them as automatically contracted out - in which case they will continue to contribute at a flat-rate for existing flat-ratebenefits and can provide in addition for themselves or not as they see fit.(v) It also eases the problem of abatement as compared with the august scheme and should, therefore, reduce the need for, and perhaps the extent of, consequential legislation to amend existing schemes in,e, g. , local government, the teaching profession, etc.6.      On the other hand, the compromise scheme is open to criticismin the following respects:-(i)   Because the graduated scheme is more favourable to the lower-paid worker, while the higher-paid worker will tend to prefer the flat-rate scheme, the option might tend to be exercised against theinterests of the Exchequer.    In other words, we might tend to collectfrom the lower-paid worker the graduated contribution which, in his case, is lower than the flat rate and from the higher-paid worker the flat*.rate which, in his case, is lower than the graduated contribution.-2-
(ii)    Members of schemes which contract out will still pay only theexisting flat rate and will contribute nothing more than they contributeat present to the deficit of the existing scheme (at least until one of theproposed quinquennial increases falls due).(iii)    The table at Appendix III illustrates that the total contributionunder the compromise scheme does not reach the level of the existingflat-rate contribution until the employee is earning about  11 a week.An employee earning less than this amount may - despite the fact thathe is ex hypothesis enjoying a favourable occupational pension scheme -nevertheless feel aggrieved if his employer, by contracting out of the compromise scheme, in effect compels him to pay a higher contributionthan he would have to bear a^ a member of the graduated State scheme.The problem would in any event be eased if a  9 &quot;crossbar&quot;   were adopted.    A further solution even more favourable to the employeemight be to restrict the share of the flat-rate contribution which a contracting out employer could pass on to his employees so that theywere never called upon to contribute themselves more than the amount paid by those with the same earnings who were not contracted out.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, has reservations on both these suggestions.7.      Nevertheless, this last point is a difficult one.    It is, of course,one aspect of the fundamental problem of the curtailment of freedom of choice for the individual which is inseparable from contracting out aswe have envisaged it.     For, although under the compromise schemecontracting out should be more limited in extent and more simple in administration than under the September Plan, the decision willnevertheless remain with the employer rather than with the employee;and we shall be open to criticism as allowing the employer to dictateto the employee in a matter in which the latter might reasonably claimto exercise the right of free choice.     It may be necessary, therefore,to introduce some legislative provision to ensure that, before employers or trustees of occupational schemes exercise the option to contract out of the compromise scheme, they take adequate steps to consult thewishes of the employees.     For this reason inter alia it is impossibleto say that the whole Committee are convinced that there is any socialor political advantage in providing for contracting out in principle.conclusions.     v&quot;hi balance, the Committee consider that the compromise schemedeserves serious consideration by the Cabinet - with a reservation thatthe level of the &quot;crossbar&quot;   will need further consideration.9.     If the Cabinet endorse the scheme, certain action will need tobe taken forthwith:-(a)    The scheme will have to be worked out in greater detail.    Forthis purpose there would be great advantage in further discussion first with our own supporters and also with outside interests.    It would perhaps be possible for such discussion to be arranged on a confidentialbasis, on the model of the recent private consultations with industry.In the other hand, it would clearly be simpler if we could conductfurther negotiations openly, on the basis of some declared statement-3-
of the Government^ intentions.    This would suggest the publication of a white Paper, possibly towards the end of August or, perhaps preferably,in &quot;october after the annual conferences of the Labour Party and theTrades Union Congress have taken place.Whether we can adopt such leisurely tactics depends on our general strategy and on our next legislative programmed content; butwe cannot afford to be too dilatory.(b)    The Cabinet may feel able to agree that, since the compromisescheme embodies a great deal of the original August Plan, drafting ofcertain parts of the forthcom ng legislation should be put in hand atonce.    This could be done without prejudice.    3ut if we are to ensurethat a Bill reaches the Statute Book next session, we cannot afford to delay its introduction long after the beginning of 1959;   and, on thatassumption, it is already late to begin drafting.R.A.3.Home Office, S.W.1.9th July, 1958.

APPENDIX IIADMINISTRATIVE FEASIBILITY OF CONTRACTING out under COMPROMISE PLANApplications for approval1.     Applications would be by employers, with the consent of Trusteesif any, in respect of employees covered by occupational schemes.   Priornotice to or consultation with the employees concerned could be statutorilyrequired.The criteria of approval2.      (i)  Equivalence;  The pension benefits provided by virtue of his employer for each person contracted out would have to be on the whole as favourable as the maximum benefits of the State graduated scheme.   Thiswould mean putting the maximum State graduated pension side by side withthe flat-rate State pension plus the pension offered by the occupational scheme.(ii)   Financial soundness;   Public service, nationalised industry, andLife Office schemes could be taken as satisfying the condition of financialsoundness, but some State supervision (at present lacking) of the soundnessof privately administered schemes appears to be needed.   (There is indeeda case for such supervision on merits irrespective of any State schemeinvolving contracting out. )  Such supervision need not be too detailed: itwould include a statutory requirement for, say, submission of annual accounts and independent quinquennial valuations;  power for the central authorityto require remedial action as a condition of continued approval if the schemeshowed an actuarial deficiency;  and satisfactory guarantees thatcontributions to the Fund would be placed outside the direct control of the employer.   It need not, however, extend to control or restrictions oninvestments.(iii)   Preservation of rights;   Pension rights of contracted out persons would have to be &quot;transferable&quot; to the extent that these rights had beencounted as equivalent to those of the State scheme - and there would be no control of occupational pension rights over and above this level.   The exactbenefit rights to be compulsorily preserved for a contracted out person who changed his employment would already have been established in all casesfor purposes of the equivalence criterion.   In effect the employer whocontracted out would undertake not only that each employee would get anoccupational pension equal to the maximum under the State scheme, but thatif the employee left the contracted out employment before reaching pension age, the due proportion of that guaranteed pension relating to the period ofservice would accrue to him.   The employer could do this by providing for adequate transfer values or frozen pensions - the techniques of transferringvalues or of preserving a frozen pension are already well understood.   Ifhe did not he would be liable (as indeed he might prefer) to find for, or in thelast analysis himself to pay, the National Insurance Fund the amount necessaryto purchase appropriate rights in the State scheme for the period of exceptionwhenever a contracted out individual left his employment.   This amount couldbe readily ascertained as it would be the difference between the flat-rate contributions already paid and the maximum State graduated contribution for the period of contracted out employment.   It would thus be unnecessary-1-SECRET
for occupational schemes to be adapted to provide formally for transferabilitybefore approval was given, or to analyse the rules of schemes submitted for approval on this point.   It would be possible for employers to fulfil the requirement either by incorporating preservation arrangements in occupational schemes at leisure, or leaving them as they are and accepting the liability to pay appropriate sums into the State scheme as required.Administration3.     A central authority (but not necessarily a separate registrar), wouldbe required to deal with applications and to see that the above conditions were, and continued to be, fulfilled.   So far as transferability is concernedeach employer contracting out \rould be required to issue a notification to each employee who left his employment and to the Ministry.   This would show the rights preserved and the method of preservation adopted in respectof the contracted out period of employment.   In default of showing any othermethod of preservation (which could be checked) it would facilitateenforcement by the Ministry of the undertaking to buy rights by appropriatepayment to the State scheme.   Failure on the part of an employer to issue the notification would be revealed automatically if a leaving employee began to pay contributions in a new employment at graduated rates instead of atthe flat-rate (which under the compromise plan would be available only under contracted out schemes).   This system, besides enabling the ministry to make checks, would build up a register of preserved rights in the custody of the Ministry which would be available when those concerned reachedpension age.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,W.C.2.9th July, 1958-2-5ECRET*
