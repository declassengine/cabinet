The plan for atridominium has been elaborated in C. (58) 102.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S. W.l.9th May, 1958.
TIMING AND PRESENTATION OF TRIDOMINIUMPROPOSALSMemorandum &quot;by officials the Cabinet at its meeting on 1st May approved .inprinciple the proposals for a tridominium in Cyprus betweenGreat 3ritain, Greece and Turkey, with a view to theproposals being communicated simultaneously to the greek and Turkish Governments and published very shortly afterwards.Since that meeting Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Athens andAnkara and the Governor of Cyprus have pointed out certainobjections to the tactics and timing of the course proposed.This paper is, however, based on Ministers&apos;  previouslyexpressed intention to present the proposals to parliament before Parliament adjourns on 23rd May for the whitsun recess,2.     The proposals could perhaps best be presented by meansof a White Paper,  introduced by a Ministerial statement.There are often a number of Ministerial statements to bemade immediately before the recess.    It would be better forthe long-awaited statement on Cyprus to be differentiatedfrom these and thus not to be left too late.    Tuesday,20th May would thus seem a suitable date.    An alternative but,for the reasons given, less satisfactory date would beThursday, 22nd May.    Bound up with this question of datesis the possibility of a Debate.3.      The intentions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe made known to the Greek and Turkish Governments inadvance.    It will then be possible to inform-1-
Parliament that the proposals have been conveyed to thetwo Governments.      On the other hand,  if the Greek and turkish Governments are told too far in advance, thedanger of leakage increases.     A leak would not only be resented in Parliament; it would also,  on past form,increase the risk that the Greek or Turkish governments might feel impelled to react adversely and to dismissthe proposals out of hand even before theirpresentation to Parliament.      In practice, time is soshort that the choice seems to lie between giving thetwo Governments three days&apos; notice or telling them theday before the statement in Parliament - i.e.   if thestatement is timed for 20th May, between 17th and 19thMay.      It is true that if the Greek and turkish governments are only approached on 19th May, thisitself may drive them to react adversely.      But j erMajesty s Ambassador at Ankara considers that theTurkish Government will regard even two or three days&apos;notice as contrary to the Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking in his message to Monsieur Menderes of April,  1957, to consult them before taking any new course of action onCyprus; and Her Majesty1s Ambassador at Athens thinks that even if there is already a new Greek Government( following the Greek elections on 11th May)  it will still be so new that we shall be suspected of timingour proposals in such a way as to ensure theirrejection.      Thus between the two dates, we should gainlittle credit for courtesy with the Greeks and Turksby giving them three days&apos;  notice rather than onlyone.      V/e could not in either case claim that w e had&quot;consulted&quot; the Greek or Turkish Government.      Sincethe proposals are to be made public in any case (rather
than forming the subject of secret negotiations with both parties before any question of publication arises)the main consideration thus seems to be that theirpublication    should not be forestalled by leakage.In the circumstances,  it would seem that nothing is tobe gained by giving the Greek and Turkish Governmentsthree days&apos;  notice and that we should merely inform them the day before the statement to Farliament, thuskeeping to the minimum the risks of an adverse public reaction on their part.1+.      In making our communication to the Greek and turkish Governments,  as well as giving details of theplan as set out in the White Paper, we should beprepared to indicate our views on the points most likely to be raised by the two Governments,      Ademarche to the Greek and Turkish Ambassadors inLondon, at the same time as the communication inAthens and Ankara, would thus seem to be a prudentadditional precaution.5.      Since it is important that the Greek and turkish governments should be induced to give the proposals afair hearing and in particular,  should do nothing toreduce the impact of their presentation to Parliament,the proposals could with advantage be presented undercover of a personal message from the Prime Ministerto the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.recently6. We have/kept in close touch with the UnitedStates Government and with the Secretary-General ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).The Foreign Secretary has taken advantage of therecent N.A.T.O.  Council meeting at Copenhagen to
acquaint, Mr.  Dulles and Monsieur Spaak with our plansiii outline.      It will be necessary to give the United: tates Government fuller information on our intentions,both as to timing and substance, once the details havebeen approved; this might be done shortly before theGreek and Turkish Governments are informed.7.      Monsieur Spaak should also be given the fullest possible information at the same time as the UnitedStates Government.      Ciiice the plan may in certaincontingencies involve decisions by IT.A.T.O.  as a whole(with regard to such matters as the selection of a governor or the defence of the Island), theIT. A. T. 0. Council should also be informed of our proposals and of their possible 1 ipli cat ions for1N.A.T.O.      Tor security reasons, this should not bedone until the day on which a statement is made toParliament.8.     We have also kept the other Commonwealth countriesinformed at intervals throughout the Cyprusnegotiations.      It would be appropriate that the &quot;old commonwealth&quot; prime Ministers should be told at thesame time as the United States Government; they havenot of course yet had the information already given toMr. Dulles.      The Governments of the new commonwealth countries might be informed on the same day as theproposals are to be presented to Parliament.9.     Confidential advance guidance will also be sent tocertain of Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad toenable them to answer questions once the proposalsbecome known.      Background briefing will be given toselected press correspondents as appropriate.
Time &quot;-table10.    The following time-table, based on the aboveconsiderations,  is therefore suggested:13th May Information on the substance and timing of our proposals conveyed to the UnitedStates Government, to the Prime ministers of the &quot;old Common..ealth&quot; countries andto the Secretary-General of N.A.T. 0.  on a personal basis.16th-17th       Final instructions despatched to HerMayMajesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Athens andAnkara.19th May Confidential communication in Athens andAnkara conveying a personal message fromthe Prime Minister and explaining our intentions to the Greek and turkish governments.

As the &quot;louse has been told, the Foreign secretary has been trying since his return from Athens to follow up soino of&apos; the ideas discussed during his two visits;and my colleagues and I have spent many anxious hoursreviewing the problem in all its aspects.      xt isclear that we have now come to a poi t at which thereis little hope of making progress along existinglines and that we must make a new start,h.      The main elements of the Cyprus problem are wellknown.      The Island,  lying close under the Anatolianmainland, has been administered under british sovereignty for nearly eighty years.      before that itwas Turkish.      The population is predominantly Greek,with an important Turkish minority.      Until recently the Greek and. Turkish Cypriot communities livedharmoniously together.      Recent events have been
driving them further apart.     There has long teen a movement among the Greek Cypriots for union with Greece.The Greek Government have supported this claim and     demand self-determination for the      -jIsland as a unit,  in the hope that the will of themajority would carry the whole Island to union with greece.     The Turkish Government,  concerned with theTurkish Cypriot community and with the strategic and security requirements of their own territory,maintain     that the partition of the Island is theonly acceptable solution.     We ourselves have importantstrategic interests, which are not disputed by our friends and allies.5. v/e have tried to find a middle way between the conflicting demands. The essential task remains tofind a solution that v/ould be acceptable to all theparties concerned.6.      Our ta.sk as the sovereign government responsiblefor Cyprus would be almost desperate if this were a dispute between unfriendly nations.    But the strongties of traditional friendship and of our alliancesunite us with Greece and Turkey.     The way of partner-ship and co-operation between friends and allies mustlead us out of the difficulties of the Cyprus question to a solution.7.     We have therefore put to the Greek and turkish governments a proposal to establish in Cyprus anentirely hew form of government, which I will call atridominium.      It will in effect be an equal partner-ship of all three countries.      While it should satisfyall,  it need offend none.       Details of our plan are set out in a White Paper v/hich will be available in the vote Office when I sit down.     Its essential features
are that the three Powers - the United Kingdom, Greece and turkey - will he jointly responsible for the Island1sadministration, through a Governor who is to he appointed with the agreement of all three of them and to whom all three will have equal access.    The people of Cyprusthemselves will enjoy a v/ide measure of responsibility forthejr own internal affairs through their democraticallyelected representatives.    They will also have the right to seek Greok or Turkish,in addition tortheir British,nationality.    Many of the final details of the plan,including the exact powers and responsibilities of theGovernor, particularly in the field of internal security,will naturally fall to be agreed between the thiee Governments.But it will be an essential feature of the plan thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government will retain certain enclaves whichthey consider necessary for the discharge of their strategicreaponsibilitles.8.     We hope that this new proposal is a gesture sufficientlybold and imaginative to convince the Greek and turkish governments that we have taken full account of their pre-occupations and sougnt to meet the essential requirements ofall concerned.    For the Greek Gypriots there will be the satisfaction of the new and close relationship with Greece;the rights and welfare of the Turkish Cypriots willlikewise be fully protected and the strategic and security requirements of the Turkish Government will be fully safaguarded.    We ourselves will continue to carry our shareof responsibility for the exercise of sovereignty.    For,  ifthis offer is accepted, sovereignty will henceforward be vested in all three powers alike.
9.      In conclusion, I would urge the House - and not onlythis House &quot;but all concerned in this country and Cyprus, aswell as in Greece and Turkey - I would urge them to reflecton the implications of the decision facing us all.    We havehad enough of &quot;bloodshed and violence.    We have endured along period of strain on old friendships.    This may &quot;be thelast chance for a long time to come to achieve an agreed solution, on which we can build real hopes for a new and better future.    It is a chance which no one should lightlythrow av/ay.
