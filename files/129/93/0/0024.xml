Appendix ITHE WORKING DOCUMENT-memorandum. Annexes A and B represent two possible developments of national insurance pension provision which would introduce a measure of wage-relatedpensions and contributions into National Insurance and put its finances on asounder basis.2. In Annex A, the existing system of flat-rate contributions and benefits is retained, graduated contributions and pensions in respect of earnings between  10and  15 a week being added for employees who are not covered by an occupational pension scheme which is contracted-out under conditions prescribed.3. In Annex B, the existing flat-rate scheme is replaced by a graduated schemeof contributions and pensions in relation to earnings up to  15 a week from whichthere would be no contracting-out.4. On the supposition that adequate statutory powers to adapt schemes byagreement would be available, and that an adequate interval say two years-would be given, information as to the way in which it is considered occupational schemes might be affected is sought, in particular, under the following heads:  (i) In the case of Annex A, the extent to which employees would becontracted-out.(ii) In the case of Annex B, and of Annex A to the extent that employees werenot contracted-out, any adaptations of occupational schemes whichmight appear desirable to avoid the contributions and pensions underthe national and occupational schemes together being excessive.(iii) The nature and extent of consultation with employees affected whichwould be contemplated in connection with either course referred to in(i) and (ii) above, having regard, in the case of (i) above, to the fact thatthe initiative in contracting-out would lie with the employer.ANNEX AContributions1. The existing flat-rate contributions for National Insurance, industrial injuries and the National Health Service, would continue to be payable as atpresent, except that they might have to be increased by, say, Is. a week (6d. a side)at quinquennial intervals.In respect of employed men earning more than  10 a week, there would be anadditional contribution of, say, 4 per cent, a side (i.e., for employer and employee)on earnings between  10 and  15 a week. For employed women, the figures of 8 and  13 might be substituted for  10 and  15 respectively. There would be noState contribution in respect of these graduated contributions.No graduated contribution would be payable by self-employed or non-employed persons.Benefits2. In respect of people not liable for graduated contributions, benefits would continue as at present. In respect of the graduated contributions, additional pension benefits would be provided on a money purchase basis. Thus, assuming a basis of3 per cent, interest, a man who entered the scheme at minimum age and paid themaximum contributions (i.e., on  15 a week) until minimum pension age, wouldqualify for an additional pension of  3 a week on top of the existing national insurance standard rate of 50s. single and 80s. married.
ANNEX BContributions1. In respect of the employed, the present fiat-rate contributions for national insurance, Industrial Injuries and the National Health Service would be replaced by a graduated contribution related to earnings up to, say,  15 a week (men) and 13 a week (women). The rate might be 8-V per cent. 1\ per cent, being attributable to National Insurance and Industrial Injuries benefits and 1 per cent, to theNational Health Service.  The contribution would be divided between employerContracting-Out3. The scheme would provide for contracting-out of the liability for the graduated State contributions in respect of men earning more than  10 a week(women over  8 a week) who were in occupational pension schemes which satisfiedcertain criteria. Contracting-out would be on the initiative of an employerapplying, with the consent of the trustees, if any, of his pension scheme to anindependent registrar whose duty it would be to see that the scheme complied with certain broad criteria to be laid down. There would be no right to opt outof the State graduated scheme on the part of individuals; nor would individual members of a contracted-out scheme be able to opt into the State graduated scheme,but an employer intending to make an application, would be required by law togive due notice of such intention to the employees likely to be affected.Proposed Criteria for Conrracting-Out(a) Equivalence4. It would be necessary for the employer to show that the total weekly outlay(employer and worker together) under the occupational scheme in respect of long-term benefits reached a prescribed level of, say, 4s. a week, i.e., the graduated contributions payable under the State scheme in respect of a worker in the middleof the graduated scale. The registrar would have discretion to take account of thecontributions paid for any long-term benefits, including widows&apos; benefits, and ofpayments made by the employer to the scheme otherwise than on a week-by-weekbasis, e.g., payments in respect of back service rights, or to keep the scheme solvent.In other cases, including non-contributory schemes, an alternative test ofequivalency of benefits would be applied.(b) Solvency5. The registrar would have to be satisfied that the employer was legallyliable to make contributions under the scheme sufficient, with the contributionsif any from the employees, to keep it solvent. The contributions would have tobe alienated from the employer. Schemes would have to submit periodicallyreturns and valuations to show that the conditions continued to be satisfied, the precise nature of the requirement depending on whether they were self-administeredor insured.(c) Preservation of Pension Rights6. The occupational scheme would have to provide on change of employment for preservation of that part of pension rights which had been accepted as equivalent to those of the State graduated scheme. Where more substantialpension provision was made in an occupational scheme, the whole of this neednot be transferable. In order to avoid occupational schemes having to providefor preservation of rights in respect of very short periods of service, it would beopen to the employer to adapt his scheme in such a way that an employee remainedcovered by the State scheme during an initial period of service. To overcomedifficulties which might arise during, say, the first three years of the new scheme,and pending the development of preservation arrangements, undertakings mightbe accepted from employers that in the event of a worker leaving employmentduring these first three years, a transfer value would be paid to the State schemeto give that worker equivalent rights in that scheme; contributions due to bereturned to the employee in such a case could be applied for this purpose.
and employed in equal or nearly equal proportions. It might have to be increased at quinquennial intervals by, say \ per cent. (  per cent, a side) of earnings. Therewould also be an Exchequer contribution of 2 per cent, of all earnings up to, say, 8 a week (men) and  6 a week (women).The contribution which would secure the present standard rates of benefit would be that appropriate to earnings of, say,  8 a week ( 6 for women) and this might be charged as a minimum in all cases.Self-employed persons would pay an appropriate rate of graduated contributions (say 6-7 per cent.) and non-employed persons would pay a flat rate.Benefits2. The present flat-rate pension would be replaced by a pension graduatedin relation to earnings. The present standard rates of pension would be payable on contributions related to earnings of, say,  8 a week ( 6 for women) but whereaverage earnings over insurance life were above this level, the pension rate wouldbe increased on a graduated scale depending on the amount of earnings up to 15 a week ( 13 for women) and on the duration of insurance.This scale would be so arranged that while everyone with earnings averagingmore than  8 a week ( 6 for women) would get more than the present standard rate of pension, the theoretical maximum rate (i.e., for a man who was age 16 onentry to the scheme and contributed until minimum pension age on earnings of 15 a week or more) would exceed the present standard rate by about  2 a week,or rather less. Benefits other than pensions would remain on the present flat-ratebasis.Occupational Schemes3. This scheme replaces the present universal scheme and its principlespreclude an option to contract-out in respect of occupational schemes.
Appendix II (i)BRITISH EMPLOYERS&apos; CONFEDERATION(Lord McCorquodale, Vice-Presidenl of B.E.C. and Chairman of its pensions committee)Comment on memorandum I have now had an opportunity of consulting the Committee and its opinion isthat it would only be a minority of employers who would exercise an option to contract out as provided in the Annex A proposals. It was thought, however, thatin the event of either the Annex A or the Annex B proposals being implemented,many employers would wish to modify existing schemes, particularly where those schemes already provide a pension which is a high proportion of earnings for persons whose earnings are of the order of  15 per week; these conditions are believed to obtain in regard to a large proportion of pension schemes for salariedstaffs. Modifications to existing schemes would generally be simpler under the annex A proposals where the benefits and the contributions for the individual are directly related than under the Annex B proposals where no such relationship exists.Consultation with employees would in most cases not involve discussions with trade unions but would be through such consultative machinery as is provided forin the pension scheme itself or is customarily used in the undertaking concerned.It is apprehended that there might be some cases in which such consultation wouldgive rise to difficulties, particularly in so far as non-contributory pension schemesmight need to be modified and part of the cost hitherto borne by the employers would in future be thrown on to employees under the revised national insurance schemes.The Committee considered that statutory powers to adapt existing schemes would need to be widely drawn so that employers would not experience unduedifficulty in making modifications of their schemes.Although it is anticipated that the option to contract-out would not be widelyexercised, our view is that this option should be available to employers and wewould hope that it would be possible to devise a method by which contracting-out would be practicable under the Annex B proposals.If the Annex B proposals were proceeded with, it might be difficult to maintainfiat-rate benefits for sickness and unemployment in conjunction with wage-relatedretirement pensions under the national insurance scheme, and the possibility of allthese benefits being wage-related would need to be envisaged.General CommentConcern is felt that, as a gradual rise in average earnings occurs, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the levels of earnings shown in the Governmentsmemorandum between which benefits will be related to earnings and that there maybe pressure for a revision of these limits in such a way as to throw an increasedburden on the taxpayer.The changes now contemplated are as radical in some ways as those introduced in the national insurance scheme in 1946. These earlier changes were made after several years of public discussion and the issue of a number of White Papers. Itseems to us essential that an adequate opportunity for public discussion of the issues involved should be given before the introduction of any Bill to implement theGovernments proposals.Appendix II (ii)ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES(Lord Chandos, Chairman)Works: 55,000 works&apos; employees. Ex-gratia scheme; rate of pension depends on length of service; maximum 30s.Staff: 30,000 staff employees. Pension arrangements in two parts; compulsoryand contributory junior (life office) scheme for each company in the group for allstaff in respect of earnings up to  750 a year; and an optional contributory
(self-administered) scheme run by the central organisation for those with earnings above  750. Entry at age 20 for men, 30 for women; about 17,000 covered in all.Contributions about 6 per cent, of basic salary (for men) matched equally byemployer. Pension is based on average salary over last five years (maximum of 450 per annum for junior scheme). Transfer of rights allowable at discretion of trustees.Annex AProvided the benefits are improved and made competitive with those whichcould be offered by insurance companies or existing pension schemes, we preferAnnex A.We also prefer Annex A because we do not think it right that employeesearning  10 a week or less should have their benefits subsidised by those earningmore than  10 a week.We do not think it right that any scheme should be used to fund any deficit on the National Insurance scheme.With this proviso, the A.E.I. and its subsidiaries would not wish to contract-out of any such scheme. We have no objection to contracting-out by others,provided it is not on a large scale.Annexes A and BA State pension scheme would fit conveniently into our present pensionstructure and would enable us to wind up a number of junior schemes for ourpresent staff earning up to  750 a year. Furthermore, we should probablydiscontinue gradually our scheme of small ex-gratia payments to retired longservice hourly paid employees.Whichever scheme is adopted, we should freeze all our junior schemes foremployees and discontinue them, giving the present beneficiaries paid-up pensionsbased on their contributions to date. In addition, we should allow junior employees to join the main A.E.I. Scheme, which would be modified appropriately to enablethem to supplement their benefits under the State Scheme thereby avoiding any reduction in their benefits.Consultation with EmployeesWe do not at present foresee any undue friction with employees following fromany modification to existing schemes.general we consider that statutory power would be necessary to enable us to modifyour existing schemes.Appendix II (iii)MIDLAND BANK LTD.(Lord Monckton, Chairman)Non-contributory scheme covering whole of permanent staff. Benefits arelarger than those suggested in Annex A.Annex AUnder the plan set out in Annex A we should certainly wish to &quot; contract-out,&quot;&apos;on the one hand because the pension entitlement is greater under the Bank&apos;s schemethan under the proposals as set forth, and on the other hand because the Bank&apos;scheme requires no contribution from the employee. Some modifications of present arrangements would be required, particularly as to transferability of rights(paragraph 6), in order to comply with the conditions indicated for contracting-out.

Some modifications of present arrangements would be required, particularly as to transferability of rights(paragraph 6), in order to comply with the conditions indicated for contracting-out.
Annex BUnder the plan set out in Annex B very substantial changes would be requiredin the Bank&apos;s scheme, to convert it into an arrangement supplementary to the Slatescheme, so that the total benefits under both would be more or less commensurate with the present benefits under the Bank&apos;s scheme. Modifications would also berequired to allow for the contributory nature of the State scheme.Consultation with EmployeesSince the existing pension arrangements cover all members of the permanent staff, general consent would have to be sought for any changes arising under(i) above. In formulating such changes, consultation would be necessary at all stages with the accredited representatives of the various constituent elements of thestaff.Appendix II (iv)UNILEVER LTD.(Mr. P. A. Macrory, on behalf of Lord Heyworth, Chairman)Optional works fund with 17,000 members (male workers only) and compulsory office fund with 18,000 members. Contributory schemes, roughlyon a 50/50 basis. Retirement pensions at 65/60 (in case of works employeespension roughly corresponds to additional benefits proposed in memorandum).Widows, children, and dependant pensions also payable. Full preservation of rights given after 10 years membership of the fund.Female workers number 8,000; the few who reach retirement age with firmare given voluntary pensions from the Company.Annex AAnnex A sets out the broad outline of a State scheme which is ingeniouslydesigned in such a way as to make contracting-out appear a practicable proposition.In essence, it provides for additional contributions at the rate of 4 per cent, bythe employer and employee on earnings between  10 and  15 a week, to be appliedto buying extra retirement pensions (and presumably widow pensions) on top of the existing flat rate benefits. The pensions would be calculated by referenceto the age of the individual at the time of payment of the contribution; underthe system known as &quot; money purchase.&quot;The system would be unattractive to the electorate, because the additional contributions would be payable immediately but extra benefits of worthwhileamount would not become payable for many years. Employers would thereforebe under certain pressure from their staff to contract out, and it would be hard to find convincing reasons for not doing so, bearing in mind that the trend towardshigher interest rates that has developed in recent years would enable individual employers initially to calculate their pensions on more favourable tariffs than anya Government scheme is likely to be able to offer.A decision to contract-out would eventually lead an employer into serious difficulties. It seems to us that the scale of benefits under the State scheme would almost inevitably be revised at a later date with some retrospective effect, eitherto allow for rises in the cost of living or because a changing social climate led ito political pressure for more generous treatment of pensioners. An employerwho had contracted-out would then find that he was contributing through general taxation towards the cost of revising the State scheme benefits, while at the sametime he would be under an obligation to make up the benefits for his own employees to the same level.This is, in our view, the most serious objection from an employer^ viewpointto the scheme outlined in Annex A. There are, however, other objections. Theadministrative complication of calculating, collecting and recording contributions
and benefits on a money purchase basis is likely to be unreasonable, bearing inmind the relatively trivial extra benefits that are to be provided.Further complications would arise in the interpretation of the various criteria for contracting-out, particularly in the case of private schemes whose basis forthe calculating of benefits is entirely different from the money purchase basisproposed for the Government scheme (e.g., schemes in which benefits are related to salary in the final years of service).It is, perhaps, pertinent to recall here that the question of permitting employers to contract out of the State scheme was given serious consideration when theUnited States State scheme was introduced. It was then decided that it wasunworkable, and it is a fact that no other major country has permitted it, includingcountries such as Belgium and West Germany, who have earnings-related pensions in their State schemes.We are in sympathy with the general principle of preserving pension rights,and in Unilever we are already more generous in this respect than almost allother employers. We are prepared in principle to go to the length of seeing thatall pension benefits accrued in our service are preserved. There are two reasons why we do not at the present time preserve the pension benefits of employees who leave after very short periods of service. The first is that the benefits wouldbe so small as not to justify the administrative costs involved. The second isthat many employees would object to the imposition of paid-up pensions insteadof a return of their own contributions. Our experience in Unilever is that morethan 80 per cent, of those who are entitled to paid-up policies derived from thetotal contributions to the fund, prefer to take instead the much less valuablepayment of a return of their own contributions. This illustrates that legalcompulsion would be necessary before employers could impose full preservationwithout causing serious resentment amongst their employees.This leads us to make an observation on the desirability of keeping people in benefit for their basic retirement provision, and at the same time ensuring amaximum mobility of labour. It is not really practicable for private schemes to preserve or transfer accrued rights for verv short service employees. Only aState scheme can fully cover the whole of working lifetime when there are anumber of changes in employment, and this is particularly so in the case ofseasonal workers and in industries such as the building trade.Because we believe that there can be no effective guarantee that any national superannuation system can continue unsupported by taxation indefinitely, wewould be most reluctant to contract-out, even from such a scheme as set outin Annex A. We are afraid that a decision not to contract-out would be difficultto explain, but we would make a determined effort to impress upon our employeesthe reasons for our action. It is our practice to carry our employees with usin changes of pension matters, but the ultimate decision rests with the Company.Annex BAnnex B sets out a system which in our view is far superior. It providesfor a graduated contribution related to earnings up to  15 a week for men and 13 a week for women. The suggested rate of contribution is 8-V per cent., dividedin roughly equal proportions between employer and employees. 1 per cent, wouldbe required for the National Health Service, and the balance of 7-V per cent,would be available for National Insurance and Industrial Injury benefits. Therewould be an Exchequer contribution of 2 per cent, of earnings up to  8 a week for men and  6 a week for women. The present flat rates of pensions would bereplaced by graduated pensions related to earnings, and it is estimated that themaximum pension for a married couple would be in the region of  6 a week.Contracting-out would not be permitted.This system incorporates many desirable features, and would form a sound basis for any future extensions of the national system. It establishes from the outset important principles, viz.:  (1) Contributions are levied on a relatively small slice of salary, correspondingroughly to the average earnings of a worker. There is thus no seriousconcealed subsidy of the lower paid by the higher paid (such as is contained in the Labour Party proposals).(2) It could be co-ordinated easily with supplementary schemes for thehigher paid.53581c
(3) Contributions would be shared between employers and employees.(4) It could be made administratively simple and cheap to run.(5) It would be readily adaptable to changes in earnings levels.The main criticism of the scheme in Annex B from Unilever&apos;s viewpoint isthat the benefits are on the low side, so that the retirement benefits even for thelower paid of our employees would be unsatisfactory by our standards. It isappreciated, however, that higher contributions might throw too severe a burden on the economy and on smaller employers.There should be no difficulty for any employer, whatever his type of scheme,in adapting his own private fund to fit in with this proposal. Some funds set up under trust deeds are, however, exceptionally rigid, and there may also bebenefits included in contracts of service. Statutory power in general terms topermit adjustment therefore seems desirable.Annexes A and BThe adjustment of our own arrangements following the introduction of thesystem would vary for works staff and office staff.Pension fund membership is not compulsorily for works staff, although thegreat majority are covered for a minimum benefit roughly corresponding to theadditional benefits proposed. This group would therefore cease contributions to the fund altogether. We do, however, have an arrangement whereby worksstaff can pay voluntary contributions which are matched by equal Companycontributions, in order to improve their benefits. This arrangement could continue.Pension fund membership is compulsory for office staff, and we should mostprobably adjust our arrangements by relating contributions and benefits to an artificial &quot; contribution salary &quot; lower than actual earnings. The deduction fromactual earnings to arrive at the contribution salary would either be a fixed amount,or a proportion of the maximum salary on which contributions were payable tothe State scheme. The advantage of the latter method would be that an automaticadjustment would be secured when changes were introduced in the State scheme.An alternative method, which might be more suitable to other employerswith different types of funds from ours, would be to require some employees to pay a contribution based on full salary and after deducting and paying overto the State scheme the contributions required under that scheme, to credit thebalance to the employer^ fund.One or other of these methods could be used to adapt any type of privatepension scheme to any type of National pension system.Appendix II (v)IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.(Mr. R. A. Banks, Personnel Director, on behalf of Sir Alexander Fleck, Chairman)Weekly paid workers: Self-administered scheme, compulsory for all newemployees; membership 68,610. Employees pay 2\ per cent, of &quot;total pick-up &quot;;employer pays balance actuarially required to maintain solvency of fund (at present3^ per cent, for men, 3 per cent, for women). Pensions are one-hundredth of average annual pay throughout service for each year of service. No preservation of rights for workers who leave voluntarily.Monthly paid employees: Self-administered scheme, compulsory for all newemployees; membership 33,220. Employees pay 5 per cent, of salary; employermatches this and pays further 2-V per cent, for male employees&apos; widows and children&apos;sbenefits. Pension for men is one-eightieth of average annual salary over last 10years of employment for each year of service; retirement age is 62.  Pension fori
women is one-seventieth instead of one-eightieth; retirement age is 55. preservation of right &quot; permitted but not generally practised.&quot;From time to time the Company has paid additional sums into the funds totake some account of the effect of inflation.Annex AIf a National scheme on the basis of Annex A were to be introduced, theCompany would wish to contract-out so that all our present funds could continue in addition to the basic State pensions.The fact that the proposed Government scheme is based on a 3 per cent, perannum rate of interest, whereas the Company&apos;s pension funds are at present earningabout 5 per cent, makes it all the easier for the Company to take the decision to contract-out, since the Company can provide its employees with better benefits fora given expenditure than would be economic under the scheme mentioned in annex A.The terms under which the Company would be allowed to contract-outare only briefly stated but they do not appear objectionable to the Company, though they would require careful drafting in which a committee of experts from industryand the Government might play a useful part.The most important changes required of our funds would relate to preservation of rights which is permitted but not generally practised in our staff funds, whereasno provision is made for it in our workers&apos; fund in the case of those who leavevoluntarily.If the Company contracted-out as provided in Annex A, it is assumed that the contract could be reconsidered if in the future the Government scheme were substantially altered.Annexes A and BIt is we think fairly easy for our Company funds to continue as supplementsto basic State pensions as envisaged in the provisions for contracting-out under thearrangements outlined in Annex A; but under the proposals briefly set out in annex B we believe there would be more difficulty. In any case, as the benefits under A (for those not contracted-out) would we believe be broadly comparable with those under B (from which there is no contracting-out) the scope for additionalCompany benefits must be less under B than for those who contract-out from A.In the event of basic State pensions being increased in the future, or a new state scheme, such as that outlined in Annex B, being introduced which precludedcontracting-out, the Company might wish to alter one or more of its present funds in order to prevent total contributions and total pensions becoming too large. Inthis connection our view is that a pension from the State, plus pension from anoccupational fund, should not exceed two-thirds of pay over the last few years before retirement.Consultation with employeesThe Company&apos;s pension funds are in no case the subject of agreement with thetrade unions. The operation of the workers&apos; fund is discussed through theCompany&apos;s joint consultative machinery and the financial state of the fund isreported, and suggestions for improvements and modifications are frequentlymade. We should, therefore, want to mention there at the appropriate time anychange likely to arise as the result of the Company contracting-out of a government scheme on the lines of Annex A. As, moreover, it has been our custom to advise the trade unions with whom we deal of any major change in the conditions orprovisions of the workers&apos; fund, we would naturally follow this course in such an event. In neither case would we expect serious opposition since the over-all pensionprovision as the result of contracting-out would presumably be better than that under the State scheme as set out in Annex A.general for these reasons [see last but one paragraph] and for others, such as new conditions required of those who contract-out, the trust deeds might need to be altered.   Powers already exist for this provided the Actuary certifies that any

Of total payments into fundsso far, company has contributed 75 per cent. Minimum pension age 60 for women.For most male employees 60, with two-sided option to extend to 65; for new maleentrants 65, with company option to retire employee after 60. Pension is fraction of final average wage or salary (in last five years) for every year of service after IS(1 / 90th for works employees, 1 / 84th for male staff and 1 /80th for female staff).Power to adapt benefits in light of N.I. benefits never exercised. Proposal nowunder consideration to offer a cold storage pension of twice employee&apos;s owncontributions (after qualifying service) with interest as an alternative to cash return of contributions.Annex AIf the Government introduced proposals on the lines of Annex A we wouldprobably wish to contract-out if we were satisfied as to the conditions for doing so.Annex BIf Annex B were adopted we would want to modify contributions and pension under the powers in our existing rules. We find it, however, difficult to see anygood reason why there should not equally be an option for occupational schemes to contract-out of Annex B, and if such option were incorporated we wouldprobably wish to take advantage of it rather than modify.Consultation with employeesWe would not anticipate any difficulty from the point of view of employeerelationships in either contracting-out (because the advantages to them of doing so would be obvious) or modifying or adapting our existing scheme (because thefairness of such proposals could be made abundantly clear). We would, of course,discuss with, and explain to, the employees any such changes just as we did when we modified our scheme after the National Insurance Act 1948.In this last connection we would like to emphasise the importance we attach to sound&apos; occupational schemes as a factor in securing and maintaining goodemployee relationship and we would hope that anything which the Governmenthave it in mind to do in this field would be accompanied by every possible practicalencouragement to the extension of occupational schemes within industry.GeneralIf I am not presuming in doing so, I would express the hope that very carefulconsideration would be given to the argument that it is not the function ofGovernment to attempt to provide universal wage-related schemes or to go beyondthe provision of a universally applicable basic retirement pension, coupling that, ofcourse, with every possible encouragement to occupational schemes.   It wouldalteration does not substantially prejudice the rights of any contributing member or pensioner. This certificate may not be easy to obtain and additional statutory powers might be needed.I hope that this information will be helpful to you, but I would emphasise thatour comments are based on the barest outline of proposals by the Government sothat many aspects of the pension plans are left out. For this reason we believe thatit would be extremely important to allow full scope for consultation between government and industry and perhaps others before legislation is adopted.
seem that neither of the two schemes now proposed goes very far in the directionof meeting the deficit ten years hence on the existing National Insurance Fund,nor do they offer any appreciable benefit to employees who retire in the near future.Annex A, which for some reasons we as a Company would prefer, has less attractionfrom that point of view than Annex B inasmuch as it does nothing for those men whose earnings are between  8 and  10 per week.In conclusion, may I say that while we understand that Annex A and Annex Bdo not purport to be more than outlines, we would hope that if either is beingproceeded with, whether with a view to the submission of a White Paper or theintroduction of a Bill, a small committee of experts representative of different types of funds might first be appointed to study the proposals and make suggestions as to (1) Equivalence and other tests to be applied to contracting-out;(2) The preservation of pension rights; and(3) The provision for the contingency of further inflation, or the raising of wage and salary levels as a result of general expansion and improvedproductivity.In our own case we would not,anticipate any difficulty in complying with any reasonable tests for equivalence; for example, the minimum contribution in respectof our lowest paid female worker is 6s. per week, that is 50 per cent, more than the4s. minimum in Annex A, and as regards preservation of pension rights, if wecontracted-out there would be no difficulty in our assuming the obligation to pay,either to the State or to another firm that had contracted-out (whichever wasapplicable in any particular case) a sum equivalent to the contributions under theState scheme plus 3 per cent, interest in respect of service prior to leaving.Appendix II (vii)CHURCHILL MACHINE TOOL CO., LTD.  [AND RONEO LTD.](Sir Greville Maginness, Chairman)Manual workers are dealt with by way of lump sum payments on retirement.Staff: 1,227 covered by pension schemes in the two concerns (1,060 men and167 women).Annex AAs regards my own organisations, I do not think we would wish to contract-out but would probably adapt our schemes which are already in existence.Annex BYou say in your letter that whilst the scheme in Annex A provides an option to contract-out this does not apply to Annex B. There may be good reasons forthis but I cannot myself see why the same contracting-out should not apply to annex B and if this were done I would think that such a scheme would be betterfrom the national point of view.general  am veiy sorry that I cannot give any estimate at all of the extent of eithercontracting-out or adaptation over the whole range of industry as I feel that no single individual is in a position to hazard any guess on this point.It might be that some staff pension schemes giving high rates of benefit would possibly wish to contract-out but until the precise intentions of the Governmentare known it would be impossible for anyone to say whether or not they would wishto contract-out or adapt.Having regard to the above it seems to me very desirable that the Governmentshould issue a White Paper to permit a full discussion and consideration of any proposals.
Annex AThe benefits under our staff schemes are such as would allow us to exercise the option to contract-out, one amendment only seeming to be necessary, i.e.,provision to be made to permit of the transfer of pension rights, or some part ofthem, on change of employment. The benefits under the works schemes, however,are not such as would permit the exercise of the option.If it were allowed, I feel that it would be right to contract-out in so far asstaff employees are concerned, and operate the Government scheme for worksemployees only. If this could not be permitted, then we should have to decide whether to improve the works schemes to such an extent as would permit us to contract-out; here, of course, the cost to the group would be an important factor.Assuming we could not afford to improve the schemes to the necessary extent, thenI consider amendments to the staff schemes would be essential, to avoid the totalcontributions and pensions under the national and occupational schemes beingexcessive.Annex BIf the proposals outlined in Annex B were adopted, it would undoubtedly benecessary for some amendments to be made in our schemes for staff employees forthe reasons given above. No amendment to the schemes for works employeeswould be necessary.Consultation with EmployeesAmendments to the schemes for staff employees could be made upon requisitenotice being given. Consultation with the employees themselves, or theirrepresentatives would not be necessary.As to the schemes for works employees, we should, as a matter of general practice, advise the employees&apos; representatives of any proposed amendments, but here again actual consultation would not be called for.GeneralThe foregoing represents my first thoughts, but you will appreciate that thematter is quite complex, and would require a great deal more study before firm decisions could be taken.Appendix II (ix)STEWARTS &amp; LLOYDS LTD.(Mr. A.

Onwithdrawal employees receive at least their own contributions or an equivalent cold-storage pension. The cold-storage pension may at the discretion of the trusteesinclude the value of the employers contribution except in cases of fraud ormisconduct. Additional pension (up to a defined total) may be purchased by voluntary contributions.Annex AOur reaction to Government scheme A is that it would be acceptable for ourworkmen, but the works fund would be re-modelled and continue to provide apast service pension for those men who by reason of age could not qualify for afull State pension. The death benefit (payable after 10 years&apos; service) would also becontinued. So far as the staff fund is concerned it would seek to contract-out of scheme A.Annex BIf scheme B became compulsory the works fund would probably be adaptedas outlined above and the staff fund would be adapted so as to provide a reducedpension representing the pension now provided by the fund less the increase in theState pension.Consultation with EmployeesThe Company has the right to terminate both funds and set up new fundswithout consulting the employees affected, but they would be given ample noticeof our intentions and representations made by them would be considered.GeneralWhilst appreciating that there may be difficulties about contracting-out of scheme B, we do feel strongly that contracting-out should be available under any scheme which may be introduced.Particularly in relation to our staff pension fund, we would like to have widestatutory powers to amend.We would very much hope, from the point of view of obtaining the maximumco-operation from the members of our funds, that whatever scheme is introduced,something in the form of a White Paper is issued prior to legislation.We would hope that prior to the final drafting of the Bill or Regulations,consultation might take place with representatives of industry to iron out any difficulties of interpretation or administration.Whilst recognising that pressure from certain directions may be considerable,we feel we must express the view that the introduction of any such scheme atthe present juncture of the nation&apos;s affairs seems somewhat unfortunate.Appendix II (x)J. SAINSBURY LTD.(Mr. N. C. Turner, on behalf of Mr. A. J. Sainsbury, Chairman)Self-administered re-insured scheme covering 7,300 employees (office staff,central factory and warehouse and retail shops).Annex AAn employer^ decision as to contracting-out will obviously depend on his judgment as to the balance of advantage flowing from many different considerations,some of which are:  (a) The employer (and  his  employees)  would  inevitably  consider  the relationship between contributions and benefits in the State scheme and
the corresponding relationship in a private scheme. An employer maywell take the view that at the present time at least, owing to high interest rates and freedom from tax on interest income in a pension fund, hecould provide better ultimate benefits for the same total outlay thanthose which would arise in the State scheme from the use of 3 per cent,as the interest basis.The results of the individual employee&apos;s consideration however maywell differ according to his age and wage level. If some employeesconsider that they are likely to be better off in a State scheme whilstothers consider that they are likely to be better off in a private scheme,then dissatisfaction is bound to arise whatever decision is taken by the employer. The &quot; money purchase &quot; basis of scheme A will accentuatethis problem since it will emphasise the very much larger benefit secured by a given contribution in the case of a young man than that secured bythe same contribution in the case of an older one.(b) The employer may feel that it is desirable in principle for pension liabilitiesto be guaranteed through the establishment of a fund rather than thatthey should be covered by a promise even though the promise is madeby the State.(c) He may feel that the development of a fund and its investment is for thecountry&apos;s good in increasing productivity.(d) If his present scheme provides benefits and contributions at a lower level than that proposed by the State he may well accept the State scheme in place of his own (and so cease a certain amount of present investment).(e) He  must consider what may well be  the increased  administrativecomplication of running his own scheme in place of the wage related partof the State scheme.(/) He may well consider not only the apparent simplicity of contracting-out hisscheme as a whole at the present time, but also what variations might bemade subsequently in such arrangements by the present or anotherGovernment. He might feel that, for example, contracting-out of theprivate scheme and into the State scheme by individual employees might at a later stage be permitted, thus facing him with the need to deal withan additional set of pension arrangements. He might decide that futurealterations of benefit rates could well provide added complication for him which he was not prepared to face. He might expect that at sometime in the future a form of &quot; escalator clause &quot; similar to that proposedby the Labour Party might be introduced and which he would not beprepared to introduce into his own scheme.(g) He could be influenced by the relative numbers of his employees whosewages come below the maximum contribution limit of  15 per week andhe may decide to deal himself only with those employees above the limit.(h) He could take the view that the benefits for all his employees should be ata certain scale and deal with this desire by adjusting his own scheme toprovide the benefits he wished, but making them subject to deduction ofamounts receivable from any present or future State scheme.(/) He may feel that he does not wish to submit to the degree of State controland supervision of his contracted-out fund which would be inevitable.(Requirements as to periodic actuarial valuation would cause noproblems, but much could go wrong with a fund during an inter-valuation period and, since an insolvent fund of a bankrupt employerwould be no guarantee of benefit, some form of continuous inspectionwould need to be instituted.)The precise method of determining the &quot; equivalence &quot; of a private scheme is ofimportance. In scheme A the use of total outlay as the criterion of equivalenceinevitably means that ultimate benefits in a private scheme will be different (perhapsappreciably different) in amount and possibly very different in form from those ofthe State scheme. Individual employees will compare ultimate benefits and if in aparticular event benefit received from a private fund is less than would have beenreceived in that event from the State fund, there will be disaffection betweenemployees and employers and between employees and the State which has approved the private fund as equivalent.
The differing rates of accrual of benefit in a private fund and a State scheme(particularly if the latter is on a &quot; money purchase &quot; basis) would inevitably causeunfortunate comparisons to be made if either (a) or (b) were chosen, (c) would bevery undesirable since the method of funding private schemes is frequently to require a total contribution expressed as a percentage of salary, although in fact the employees share is in practice allocated unevenly as between employees of differentages.The method of preservation is also of importance. If payment of a transfervalue to the State or to a new employees fund is envisaged there could be many problems for the paying fund, e.g., the difference between the transfer value and theactuarial reserve held in the fund giving rise to possible need to realise investmentsto produce cash. Further, a transfer value calculated on the basis of the benefit which would have accrued for a young man under a &quot; money purchase &quot; state scheme would in very many cases be considerably in excess of the reserve held inthe private fund.If, on the other hand, the &quot; cold-storage&quot; method is to be adopted,administrative problems arise and continue for a considerable period of years. Foran employee who changes his employment at frequent intervals there will the disadvantage of having to collect his ultimate pension from a number of differentsources.Some employers may well be influenced in their consideration by a knowledgeof what happened in the United States at the time when social security legislation was being discussed there in the 1930&apos;s. It seems to have been the generally accepted view in the United States that some form of contracting-out was desirable.However, very full consideration eventually led to the conclusion that contracting-out could not be made a workable proposition. If, therefore, an employer takes theview that the ultimate decision in this country would inevitably be the same, then hewould probably decide that even if contracting-out arrangements are made possible at the outset he will not take advantage of them since he feels that they cannot bemaintained.Although no firm decision can be taken in the absence of complete details ofthe proposed State plan and of possible contracting-out arrangements, it is felt atthe moment that J. Sainsbury Ltd. would be considerably influenced by the points53581dThe inclusion in the test of equivalence of payments by the employer in respectof back service could well produce cases where the employee^ accruing benefit wasappreciably less than that under a State scheme, since the total payments to theprivate fund in such a case will in effect be payments in respect of benefits accruingduring two separate periods of time.Requirements for some form of preservation of accrued pension rights for an employee who changes his employment can give rise to considerable problems and difficulties. The principle of preservation does not commend itself to ail employers,a number of whom still regard a pension as a benefit which only vests in the employee on his retirement.The extent of the problem of enforcing preservation contrary to the wishes ofsome employers would clearly depend on the extent to which preservation isrequired. There would presumably be little objection if it is required only in respectof benefits at State level arising after the inception of the extended State scheme.There will be stronger objection to a requirement for preservation of all rightsaccruing in a private scheme after such time and probably serious difficulties if anattempt were made to enforce preservation in respect of rights accrued in privateschemes throughout the past working lifetime of members. (J. Sainsbury Ltd. wouldbe happy to provide for preservation of all rights accruing under their own scheme,at least from the inception of the extended State schemedA further question to be considered is whether the rights to be preserved are based on:  (a) accrued benefit in the private fund; or(b) the amount of benefit which would have accrued in the State scheme; or(c) the amount of contributions paid into the private fund in respect of thetransferring employee; or(d) the amount of contributions which would have been paid to the state scheme in respect of the transferring employee.
made in paragraph (/) and the paragraph above and would probably refrain from taking advantage of initial contracting-out arrangements. It is considered likely that many employers would be similarly influenced.Annexes A and BThe extent of adaptation of existing schemes would clearly vary according tothe relationship between the benelits which they provide and the contributions which they require from employees and the corresponding figures for the increaseof benefits and contributions in the alternative State schemes. In cases where an existing scheme provides small benelits and requires little or no contribution fromemployees, employers may well be prepared to continue to operate such a scheme&quot; on top of &quot; the new State scheme. On the other hand, the higher the rate ofbenefit or the rate of employee contribution under the existing scheme, the moreneed there is likely to be for adaptation.The form of adaptation could be either:  (a) reduction of benelits and/or contributions (so as to prevent the total cost ofState and private scheme to employer or employees from becoming too high) and consequent operation of such reduced scheme on top of thenew State scheme;(b) the insertion of a provision in the existing scheme to the effect that benefits would be reduced by those arising under the State scheme (or perhapsthose arising under the wage-related part of the State scheme). In sucha case a corresponding reduction in contributions would also berequired.Any plan for adaptation would normally require the agreement of all members or, alternatively, those members not agreeing would cease to be covered by thescheme. Employees would thus have in effect an option to remove themselves from the coverage of their employers scheme which, in the case of youngeremployees at least, they might be tempted to exercise so as to avoid some paymentof contribution. In consequence employers who at present operate generouspensions schemes and require their employees to contribute could be forced toaccept what would amount to resignations from their scheme but not from their employment.In the case of the existing J. Sainsbury Ltd. scheme the rate at which pensionbenefit accrues to the individual is inevitably different from that of either of theproposed State schemes and it would probably be necessary to adapt the present scheme by providing for a scale of benefits which would be subject to deduction ofamounts receivable from the State.Consultation with EmployeesPresumably the majority of employers wishing to contract-out would first take steps to ensure that such an arrangement would not meet with violent opposition from their employees. This could be done in most cases by informal consultations with shop stewards although the latter might be influenced in expressing opinionsby any published views of the T.U.C. or Labour Party. Such published views could thus have some effect on the amount of contracting-out which would eventuallycome to pass.The practical need for some consultation with employees could well give riseto lengthy and detailed negotiations with the staff as to all the details of an existing or adapted scheme. This again is a point which might influence some employers in deciding not to adopt the contracting-out procedure.GeneralAny extension of State pensions which requires from employees contribution in excess of the present rate could well be regarded by them as a reduction ineffective (i.e., net) earnings and might therefore lead to increased wage demands.From this point of view scheme B is to be preferred to scheme A since it requiresreduced contributions from lower paid workers.It is implicit in a &quot; money purchase &quot; scheme that benefit will only accrue inrespect of contributions after the inception of the scheme. Further, in the case of scheme B it is apparently the intention that benefit in excess of present flat rates would only be paid in respect of years of contribution on a wage-related basis.

Non-contributory self-administered schemes for all three grades. Thehourly paid operatives scheme would need a small improvement to bring up to levelof benefits in Annex A. The other two are above it. None of the schemes providesfor preservation of pension rights.Annex AWe would not seek, in the case of Annex A, to contract-out.Annexes A and BWe would seek to amend our own pension schemes so as to provide pensions which, together with National Benefit, were reasonable in relation to earnings. Inmaking such amendments to our schemes, a dominant consideration would be thatwe should not render ourselves, in this respect, uncompetitive at home and abroad.Could this intention possibly be maintained in the face of inevitable political andpopular pressure for &quot; full &quot; benefits to become immediately payable as has alwayshitherto been the case with increases of benefits?It may be noted that any back-dating of rights to wage-related pensions would to some extent duplicate rights which have already accrued (and been funded) ina number of private schemes.Although the point is not concerned with any of the three specific questionsasked, it is noted that both of the alternative State schemes appear to anticipatepayment of all pensions (including the wage-related part) out of accruing income.In other words, both schemes appear to provide what is, in effect, a redistribution of part of the national income. No arrangements are apparently contemplated forspecial steps to be taken to assist an increase of productivity. It is suggested that,in view of the likely demographic situation in Great Britain in future years, an extended State pension scheme would need to rely on productivity increasing to agreater extent than would otherwise be necessary. Failing this, the real resourcesof the country in future years would not be sufficient to meet the financial spending power of the then employed persons and pensioners. The result could only befurther inflation, and neither pensions nor wages would have the real value expectedunder the terms of the proposed schemes.It is not suggested that the solution to this problem lies in the creation of aninvested fund for State pensions. On the contrary, it is felt that the very largefund necessary would for several reasons be highly undesirable. What issuggested is that whatever steps may be taken by the State to increase productivity(for reasons unconnected with National Insurance) would need to be made evenmore effective if they are to provide for the ultimate economic needs caused by anextension of State pensions.It is believed that all the problems which would arise from the introduction ofenhanced benefits on a wage-related basis would become progressively more serious as the levels of benefits and contributions are increased. Correspondingly theproblems would be minimised and be far less disturbing to the very considerablenumber of satisfactory existing private schemes if State benefits are restricted towhat might be termed &quot; basic need.&quot; This phrase is not intended to imply a baresubsistence level but rather a reasonable level of benefit in relation to the normalearnings of an average routine industrial employee (possibly  11/ 12 a week).Existing benefits might be retained as being appropriate to a somewhat lowerearnings rate and wage-related benefits introduced in respect of the difference.
Consultation with EmployeesWe have power to vary the terms of all our schemes at appropriate notice, and indeed in this connection our Rules visualised specifically the possibility of futurechanges in National Social Insurance plans. Further, our schemes arenon-contributory, and we would seek to continue them in that form. It would not therefore be necessary for us to consult with employees, but naturally the reasonsfor any important and fundamental changes in our schemes would be thoroughlyexplained in advance to them. In this connection, it would be of the greatestassistance if the general public were fully informed of Government intentions inadvance of legislation, so that our employees would have the benefit of fullunderstanding of the proposed Government scheme.general in 1951, National Insurance pension benefits represented, for marriedhourly-paid employees, only about 25 per cent, of their earnings, and our purpose in then introducing a pension scheme was to &quot; top up&quot; their benefits so as toprovide, from national and company schemes combined, a pension representingapproximately 50 per cent, of earnings, as a maximum.The Government schemes now under consideration, both Annexes A and B,would fundamentally alter the whole background to our own schemes. Forexample, under A, a Ford employee with average earnings could receive maximum benefit from the Government scheme alone of approximately 50 per cent, of earnings. Also, we have to consider the possibility that further advances in national pension benefit might be made by subsequent Governments. Inconsequence, we believe that the effectiveness of Company schemes will inevitablytend to be eroded in the future, and it would be better that we should face up tothe position now, and regard the National scheme, with its manifest advantages of transferability, &amp;c, as the foundation and main future source of pension benefit for our employees.Appendix II (xii)JOHN LEWIS PARTNERSHIP LTD.(Mr. O.

These will be permanent features in any retailbusiness, since it is uneconomic to employ more men and more older persons for a great deal of the work.Annex AIt is most improbable, in the case of Annex A, that any employees wouldbe contracted-out.
Annexes A and BIt is probable that the Partnership^ scheme would be adapted, in the caseof Annex A or Annex B, by a change of the rules. That change would make itpermissive to deduct, from the pension calculated in accordance with the scheme,half the half paid for by the employer of the wage-related part of a retiringmember&apos;s National Insurance pension. Amounts equal to such deductions wouldbe repaid by the pensions fund to the employing company to compensate that company for the wage-related contributions that it had paid.Consultation with EmployeesAs the statement indicates, such a change, indeed any change, of the ruleswould require the consent of a Board and Council on which members of thescheme are very fully represented.general for many of the young women employed on relatively low pay in such[retail] businesses the 7s. 8d. (soon to be increased to 8s.), which is now deducted from their weekly pay, is a heavy charge in respect of which, if they marry, theyobtain little return unless they can afford to continue their contributions aftermarriage.The Partnership is therefore inclined, and I think that most retailers wouldbe inclined, to prefer Annex B to Annex A, since Annex B would reduce thecontributions paid by and in respect of any women whose pay is less than about 9 8s. a week.It is stated in paragraph 4 of the memorandum attached to your letter that&apos;; adequate powers to adapt schemes by agreement would be available.&quot; It is assumed that the powers would be wide enough to allow variations of trust deedsand that there would be ready acceptance by the Commissioners of Inland revenue of necessary adaptations of schemes already approved.Appendix II (xiii)THE ENGLISH ELECTRIC  CO.

These schemes cover approximately 10,000 membersof the staff or 22 per cent, of this Company&apos;s total number of employees and forthem contracting-out could be considered, and our present feeling is that weshould do so.
We should not be in a position to contract-out in relation to the membersof our works pension scheme who number 8,100 hourly-rated employees.Annexes A and BTo the extent that employees were not contracted-out. the adaptation ofour staff pension schemes would probably take the form of reducing the figureof pensionable salary used in the schemes by an amount which would as closely as practicable ensure that the combined benefits to be derived from the national insurance scheme and the staff pension schemes would remain unchanged. this the Company would have power to do unilaterally under the rules of the schemes.One effect of this form of change would be to&apos; reduce the compulsory minimumcontribution of the employee who would be left to decide whether to reduce hiscontributions in the light of his increased contribution to the National scheme or not.Consultation with employeesAlthough there would be no obligation upon the Company to obtain theapproval of the members of the scheme to the changes proposed, we should nevertheless take every step to inform our staff of the reasons for the changesby consultation through the various staff committees.We should here explain that none of our schemes are the subject of agreementwith the Unions and changes in these schemes would not be negotiated withthe Unions.Appendix II (xiv)COURTAULDS  LTD.(Sir John Hanbury-Williams, Chairman)Works: About 20,000 employees.

Though it may be necessary for us to examine our scale of such benefits inthe light of the proposed changes in the Acts, it will probablybe unnecessary to make much other change affecting those of our employees who do not contribute, and these of course number the great majority of our people, some 20,000 or more.The position of the staff scheme, all of whose members some 6,000 menand women contribute, and of the contributory members of the employeesscheme some 2,000 is much more difficult. It will first be difficult to decide what is best to do, and this decision can only be reached after lengthy consultationwith experts and managers, both inside and outside the Company, and after careful study of the details of the National scheme when it is introduced. one possibility, of course would be for the Company scheme to come in only at the stage where the National scheme reached its ceiling, that is to say,  780 per annum,or such other figure as might be the limit from time to time in the future.
-    165^ SECRET 23Consultation with employeesAs to the nature and extent of consultation with members of our schemes,the rules of our schemes do require very full consultation with members about any proposed changes. All members are entitled to a vote, and 75 per cent, ofthose voting must be in favour before the change can be made. We would useevery endeavour of explanation and persuasion to effect the changes necessarywithout invoking statutory powers, but we feel that it would be essential that adequate statutory powers should be available for the purpose. Indeed, youask us to assume that adequate statutory powers to adapt schemes by agreement would be available, but I suggest that there would have to be some provision in such powers to deal with a situation where agreement seemed impossible tosecure.general  believe a graduated retirement benefit to be a desirable development ofthe National Insurance provisions.Appendix II (xv)SHAW SAVILL AND ALBION CO.

m     1B 8Consultation with EmployeesThe adaptation of the Company&apos;s scheme would involve an alteration in the trust deed Following a recommendation by the trustees (representing the company and members) meetings of the members would be necessary and resolutions passedthereat to alter the trust deed and rules which alterations would also have to besubmitted to the Inland Revenue authorities for approval.GeneralThe above comments are made in respect of men only since we havecomparatively few women employees and these are in offices. It would probably bedeemed desirable to restrict the entry of women to our scheme if either A or Bschemes were instituted (Very few women continue in Company&apos;s service untilpensionable age.)On broad lines I would say that plan A would be the one likely to be preferredif the shipping industry had to choose between that and plan B and I would not anticipate a great deal of difficulty in exercising a right to contract-out understatutory powers. In this connection we have already had some experience as wehave &quot;contracted-out &quot; of the Merchant Navy Officers&apos; Pension Fund and havehad our scheme accepted in lieu thereof for officers serving in our vessels. Similarlyunder plan B I would not expect any great difficulties in securing the approval ofour employees to adaptations of our scheme. I think we could reasonablydemonstrate that the combined contributions and benefits of both schemes couldbe fairly held to be excessive. Under both plan A and plan B, however. I think it is inevitable that some form of controlled transferability of minimum benefits will haveto be provided for either by legislation or alteration of rules of many private schemes.In most of what I have written above I have had in mind private contributoryschemes which provide benefits greater than those envisaged by the proposed national schemes but I think the cases of non-contributory private schemes presenta different problem and approach.It also seems to me that both plans A and B proceed on the assumption that unemployment and sickness benefits could be retained at their present levels butthat pensions would vary with earnings but I am doubtful if this different treatment in National Insurance benefits could be of long duration.Appendix II (xvi)THE BRISTOL AEROPLANE COMPANY LTD.(Sir Reginald Verdon Smith, Chairman)[No details of pension scheme supplied]Note on.Position in Aircraft industry for a variety of historical reasons, in particular the large-scale rise andfall of employment levels in the aircraft industry over the last 20 years,occupational schemes for workpeople (as distinct from staff) in this section of engineering (and probably in most) are uncommon: in our own case work-people have the benefit of a non-contributory life assurance and lump sum retirementbenefit scheme but no pension scheme and we have not thought that with theinstability of recent years its introduction has been justified.and might take the form of eliminating the first  7 per week of earnings say  30 per month from contribution to the Company&apos;s scheme by employee and company with consequent diminution of benefits. (Note. Under Annex B the present standard rates of National Insurance benefits are appropriate to earnings of  8 perweek and the Company&apos;s scheme at present is entirely additional to present national insurance benefits Annex B contemplates an extension of contributions and benefits up to  15 per week earnings and the adaptation mentioned above wouldeliminate the extension appropriate to  7 per week of earnings.) Annex B scheme would operate entirely for categories (4), (5) and (6) and in all probability forcategory (2).
Annex AIn the case of Annex A, employees would not be contracted-out at all.Annexes A and BIn either case we should arrange for existing occupational schemes to be modified.Consultation with EmployeesWhen alterations are made to the rules of the Company&apos;s scheme, consultationis normal and in the case of contributory schemes (staff only) is obligatory but no particular difficulty has been experienced jn the past in giving effect to substantial,alterations in rules (e.g., to adapt our schemes when the National Insurance Acttook effect), nor would it be expected in this case unless there was nation-wideopposition to the proposals.GeneralOur general preference would be to see the Government encourage theextension of occupational schemes rather than the extension of the national scheme.We feel that this is in the public interest in channelling private savings throughinsurance companies into industrial investment generally, rather than throughGovernment into forms of investment or expenditure which are not necessarilyproductive.We also feel that the encouragement of company loyalties on the part of employees, which has prompted the introduction of occupational schemes, shouldbe an object of policy on the part of a Government which is convinced of theeconomic merits of private enterprise.But if an extension to the national scheme must be introduced, we ourselveswould prefer that there should be no contracting-out since we feel that contracting-out not only encourages situations inconsistent with the development of standardnational practice, but also (notwithstanding safeguards) discourages mobility within an industry.We are of course aware that other far-reaching proposals have been canvassedand we recognise that there may be over-riding reasons for the introduction of changes at the present time, but unless there is compelling urgency in the matter wewould have hoped that, having regard to the many divergencies of view withinindustry and the real difficulties of reconciling them, the subject might have beenpublicly debated against the background of a White Paper before the introductionof legislation.Appendix II (xvii)PILKINGTON BROTHERS LTD.(Sir Harry Pilkington, Chairman)Works: Contributory and compulsory scheme. Minimum contribution of employees, 2s. a week; no maximum, but matched by employees contribution up to5s. a week only.Staff: Contributory scheme, each side paying C per cent, of salary.Annex AIf scheme A were to be introduced we would be likely to contract-out, for two reasons; first, that our own schemes give a considerably better return than theGovernment one, at least in part, because our actuaries are willing to accept a 4 percent, rate of return and the firm guarantees such a rate, whereas the Governmentactuaries seem to consider that 3 per cent, is the best that can be assumed; and secondly, because we believe that a special scheme with varying benefits for that section of our employees only that earn between  10 and  15 a week would be administratively extremely difficult and unsatisfactory. If we contracted-out we donot think we would need to modify our occupational schemes to any material extentsince the benefits given are already better than those proposed under scheme A.
general it might interest you to know that in 1947, when the National Insurance schemestarted, there was come considerable feeling at the time that it would be impossibleto retain our own workmen&apos;s pension scheme intact, under which membership of ourworkmen&apos;s pension fund is a condition of employment. After prolonged talks with the Unions and the shop stewards it was possible to get all employees toagree to retain membership as a condition of employment and to be ready for improvements in our own scheme which we have since introduced. I am quite sure that this is now regarded as being a very wise decision. At that time, in ourworkmen&apos;s pension fund, the contribution was only Is. 2d. per week, matched, andlast year we felt that sufficient time had passed for us to be able to make a further improvement and we made the minimum matched contribution 2s. and offered to match up to 5s. There has been no difficulty about this at all and at the momentabout 50 per cent, of those eligible are contributing at least the 5s. that we match.Your proposals are certainly a move in the right direction, but on first readingit seems to me that scheme B is considerably the better of the two, and that wewould be able to keep our own schemes as well.Appendix II (xviii)SHELL PETROLEUM CO. LTD.(Lord Godber, Chairman)Contributory funded scheme; covers 7,000 works employees and 12,100 staffon a uniform basis (a further 6,100 works employees and 5,700 staff of the Shell-Mexand B.P. Group are in a separate fund). Contributions and pension benefits are inexcess of those proposed under Annex A or Annex B, and take account of thosepayable under the present National Insurance scheme.Annex AIn the case of Annex A, we should most probably not contract-out.Annexes A and BThe contributions to both the funds mentioned above (both by employees andby Companies) are in excess of those which would be payable to either of the schemes in Annex A or Annex B, as are the pension benefits. Contributions to the funds are already reduced by the amount of contributions to the present national insurance scheme so far as they relate to retirement pensions and widows&apos; benefits and the benefits payable by the funds are correspondingly reduced when national insurance retirement pensions or widows&apos; benefits become payable. We should expect to be able to continue on a similar basis. It might be that no modification of annex BIf, on the other hand, scheme B, which to us appears a better scheme, were adopted, then we think we would modify our own schemes so that in the earlier stages at least the employees, both in the staff and the non-staff schemes, wouldhave the opportunity of paying no more in total than they pay now. We would,however, expect, by patience and persuasion, to induce the very great majority ofour employees in both schemes to continue paying the same matched contributionsas at present, thereby securing rather better retirement benefits in the particularsalary groups with which your scheme deals.As regards the staff, under your scheme B those earning  10 a week would pay less than now; those earning  15 a week would pay 2s. 9d. more. If we wereto reduce our staff contribution from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent, at this level if wouldresult in a reduced contribution of about 3s. per week, which almost balances the2s. 9d. but again we believe that we would be able to keep most people convincedthat it was worth paying the present percentage in our scheme in addition to yourextra contributions.
the present regulations of the funds relating to &quot; State pension deductions &quot; wouldbe necessary, but this in particular will require further study when the terms ofthe National scheme are known.Consultation with EmployeesIt will be understood from the above that the introduction of a wage-relatedNational pension scheme would result in no basic change either in the total ofcontributions payable by employees towards retirement pensions or in the totalof the benefits they received. Employees are accustomed to a similar result whenchanges are made from time to time in the level of contributions to and benefits fromthe present National Insurance scheme and it is thought that a re-affirmation of theposition in the form of an announcement to employees is all that would be required.Appendix II (xix)COLVILLES LTD.(5/7- Andrew McCance, Chairman)Staff scheme; insured; covers approximately 2,200 members.Annex AThe desire to contract-out would arise for two reasons, either:  (a) that an occupational scheme was already in existence which gave greaterbenefits than the State scheme, or(b) that the benefits equivalent to the State scheme could be obtained from a smaller total contribution, which would therefore benefit both the worker and the employer.The matter of pensions for wage earners has been under consideration by myCompany and a quotation received from our insurance advisers indicates thatpensions equivalent to those of Annex A could be obtained for approximately one half the proposed combined contribution of 8s. per week given in the memorandum.For the foregoing reasons, therefore, I would anticipate that the number ofemployers who wished to contract-out might be considerable.Presumably some portion of the contribution of 8s. per week is intended tocover back service that is, a contribution to cover the payment of full pension tocontributors who have made only partial contributions to the pension fund from thedate of its inception to the time for their retirement.If so, this purpose only requires a lump sum total payment and not a weekly contribution in perpetuity.Annexes A and BIn existing occupational schemes where the benefits are less than those offered by the new State scheme, it is not anticipated that any great difficulty would befound in modifying the scheme to bring it into line with the State proposals. Itshould be realised that in some cases action contrary to trustee responsibilities maybe involved.There are, however, a large number of non-contributory schemes in which thewhole premium is paid by the employer and it is most likely that opposition would arise if the suggestion were made that they be abandoned in favour of the state scheme.The employee could well argue that if the employer could afford to pay for anon-contributory scheme before the State scheme, no change in these circumstances had been made by the introduction of the State scheme.
GeneralThe graded contribution principle of Annex B is to be preferred.The National Health Service and Industrial Injuries benefits should be divorcedentirely from pension benefits. This is an unsatisfactory feature of Annex B.No Exchequer contributions should be made to any scheme of pensionimprovement. The benefits and contributions in any case for improved pensions should not depart from sound actuarial principles.I suspect that neither Annex A, nor Annex B, conforms to this condition,although there is insufficient information disclosed to judge properly.Block contributions from State revenue at the inception of a new schemeprovides a precedent for future Governments to offer still greater benefits out ofgeneral taxation.The opportunity might be taken to reconsider the basis of 3 per cent, interest onwhich calculations in the memorandum have been made.All schemes should contain a provision for contracting-out.The principle of transferability will demand a substantial amount of administrative work, requiring enlarged staffs on the part of the employers. It is equivalent to an increase in their contributions.Without commenting on the additions proposed in the memorandum foraugmentation of weekly pensions, it is suggested that this matter requires the most careful deliberation and consideration before any final decision be taken.Two probable consequences are likely to arise out of any scheme to augmentpensions:  (i) the workers will demand wage increases to meet the increase in their contributions, thus increasing costs without any gain in production;(ii) there will be less incentive for private saving and industrial investment,and therefore industrial progress will suffer. More and more it will encourage the socialist belief that only the State can provide the capitalrequired for industrial expansion.The comments which I have expressed have been derived from a considerationof the industrial problems which are involved in the proposals and not from theconsideration of any political consequences.I believe that the abandonment of non-contributory schemes in thecircumstances might create some industrial resentment.That being so, there is some danger that quite a number of cases might arisewhere, owing to combined national and occupational pensions, the total amountswould be excessive.Consultation with EmployeesI would regard it as within the powers of an employer in the case of a non-contributory scheme to take such decisions as he thought fit without consultationwith the employees. In the case of a contributory occupational scheme-,consultation would be necessary but it is not thought that much difficulty would arise if a change involved improved benefits for the insured persons. In cases wherebenefits from a private occupational scheme exceeded the proposed State schemeterms, modification to bring it into line with the State scheme would seem to beimpossible without great opposition from the employees.
Appendix II (xx)ARTHUR GUINNESS,  SON &amp; COMPANY LTD.(Sir Hugh Beaver, Managing Director)Non-contributory scheme for staff and permanent works employees in theUnited Kingdom; (separate but identical scheme for staff and employees in irish republic). Pensions at age 65 (60) or later retirement; one-sixtieth of retiring salaryor pay (one-forty-fifth for female staff) for each year of service after age 18 (up to a limit of two-thirds retiring salary or pay). Pension abated by amount of national insurance pension for a single man. Scheme at present only partly funded; UnitedKingdom fund amounts to about  1-4 millions (Irish fund about  44- millions). fund is at present supplemented from profits sufficiently to meet the cost of using finalsalary instead of average salary basis.Benefits are transferable after 10 years&apos; service.The scheme also includes ill-health or injury pensions and widows&apos; pensions.Annex AWe believe that under your scheme A we would be allowed to contract-out,but this is not certain. There are many grounds particularly those of our relationswith our employees that would make us wish to maintain our present closepersonal and intimate scheme. On the other hand we are not certain, so far as weare competent to judge, that scheme A is the better scheme; while at the sametime we realise contracting-out may be impracticable under scheme B. In anycase we feel that we would wish in such a matter before the final decision were taken to lay the whole matter before the beneficiaries of the pension fund.There are two further points that affect us one is the obvious one that if wedo not contract-out, but abate the State pension, we shall, as we understand it, be virtually operating two different schemes, for employees under  800 a year andfor those over  800. This, though not impossible, would we feel be unhappy.Secondly, we have at present two schemes absolutely identical and operated inexactly the same way for our English company and our Dublin company. unless we contracted-out, there would have to be two different schemes.The arguments as we see them at present are therefore in favour of contracting-out, but had we the full schemes and were we able to consult our people the decision might conceivably be different.Annex BIf scheme B, or something like it, is in the end introduced we have the powers under our approved pension rules to modify our scheme to abate the new Statepension; as we do the present in part. There would thus be no question of the combined pensions producing a total exceeding or at least equalling the full wageof an individual. But there would be the grave disadvantages which I have already mentioned.Consulation with EmployeesWith regard to your question (iii) it will be obvious from what I have alreadywritten that we would like to have the fullest open consultation with all the people in our employ who would be affected. Although the initiative of contracting-out lies with the employer, we consider that in this we are no more than the trustees of our employees&apos; interest. The decision would involve our good faith and the goodwill of our employees; and we feel this is so likely to be the casegenerally throughout industry that we for our part would hope that in due course the scheme could be made the subject of a White Paper, or the equivalent, and beopenly debated.general there is one further matter of general impact on which we feel bound toexpress our views.   Both schemes seem partly to arise out of the fact that the

Caffyn, Chairman)Garage ProprietorsHourly paid employees: Contributory scheme; weekly contributions of Is. 6d.or 3s. at employee^ option; pension (at 65) of 6d. or Is. for each year of service.Weekly and monthly paid staff: Contributory scheme; 5 per cent, of salary each side; pension one eightieth of average salary over last five years for each year ofservice.Annex A-We should not wish to contract-out in the event of Annex A being put intooperation.Annexes A and BWe do not think any adaptation of our scheme would be required. In thecase of [hourly paid employees&apos; scheme] we might introduce the option of transferring back from 3s. to Is. 6d. At the present time, if an employee agrees to Is. 6d. he can later transfer to 3s., but we do not allow the reverse procedure.In regard to [weekly and monthly paid staff scheme] it is just possible that we mightintroduce a modification to ignore the first part of the employee&apos;s salary, &quot; e.g.. 100 or  200,&quot; but we think this is most unlikely since the additional contributionat the maximum for the employee would only be 4s. a week less tax.Consultation with employeesOur pension scheme is operated by a Board of trustees comprising fiverepresentatives of the Board and five members of the staff who come from five ofour major branches, but a consultation could not be very complete as we have staff employed in 50 branches. We feel, however, we could arrive at a reasonableconclusion as to the reactions of our staff. We would add that when our schemewas instituted in 1947, [the hourly paid employees&apos; scheme] only allowed for a contribution of Is. 6d. and it was on the request of the staff that we gave the option of 3s. We have been contemplating a possible extension to 4s. 6d. a week, but weare holding this in abeyance until we know what modifications will be made to theNational scheme.GeneralWhen our scheme was instituted in 1947 we gave all staff the option of joining.Ninety-one per cent, of the hourly paid staff and 95 per cent, of the weekly andmonthly paid staff joined, and we are of the opinion that there is an increasingdesire to make provision for pensions on retirement, and an addition to the national scheme would be welcome, and the one you suggest would not be looked upon asimposing an excessive burden on the staff.May I make two further observations (1) As a member of the Local Authority it appears to me that legislation would be needed in order to modify the present Local Authoritysuperannuation scheme, since otherwise a member of the staff earning 750 per annum, having served for forty years and obtaining themaximum pension under scheme A for a married man, would apparently be entitled to a pension of  850 per annum.SECRET!present State pensions scheme is financially unsound; both schemes certainlyscheme A would apparently only temporarily improve the position. Presumablyhowever this is already engaging your attention. But on the broader questionwe believe that the large part of industry which is already operating good pension schemes should be encouraged to continue doing so; and that that will producegreater national economic strength and a sounder national investment position.
(2) As a member of the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, I am naturallyinterested as to how this would affect the Civil Service pay conditions,and again it seems to me that the modification in the Civil service pension scheme would be called for.Appendix II (xxii)JAMES LONGLEY &amp; CO. LTD.(Mr. Norman Longley, Chairman)Building Contractors and Joinery ManufacturersThe Company belongs to an industrial pension fund managed by trusteesappointed by the National Federation of Building Trades Employers. [No further details supplied.]Annex AI do not think that in my industry (building) there would be a great deal of contracting-out. Undoubtedly firms already having pension schemes would wishto modify their schemes in order to top up benefits under any National scheme.Speaking of industry generally, no doubt, given the opportunity, some firms wouldopt to contract-out, particularly the larger firms with specialised products andif not given the opportunity to contract-out they might oppose the whole proposal.Annexes A and BI think that in either case firms that did not contract-out would wish to modify their schemes so that total pension rights were giving retirement benefits slighty more favourable than at present.In my Company&apos;s case, we are members of an industrial pension fund managed by trustees appointed by our trade federation (National Federation of BuildingTrades Employers) so that many firms are in the same scheme. Any option to contract-out would complicate matters as different firms would have different views and the trustees might well be in a difficult position. But if the scheme in Annex Bis applied then the combined benefits of compulsory and voluntary pensions wouldhave to be judged and perhaps re-assessed.Consultation with EmployeesHaving been told by the trustees of our fund what we could do the directorswould decide and tell members of the staff and for this reason they would wish theiroverall pension position to be slightly improved to prevent resentment.general  consider the contribution and benefit scales in Annex B preferable to thosein A.I am afraid my views may not be very &quot; consistent.&quot; I find the whole questionhighly involved and I feel that if you contemplate any action plenty of time shouldbe allowed for discussion so that people can grasp the proposals and expressopinions after consultation with people having specialised knowledge.
Appendix II (xxiii)E.

Provision for reduced pension on earlyretirement. Benefit may be foregone in part to provide widow&apos;s pension; deathbenefit of one year&apos;s salary is provided.Note on position in cotton industrySo far as my experience goes I think that occupational insurance schemesextending to all classes of workpeople are few in the cotton spinning and weavingindustry. How many firms have schemes similar to our own for their managers,foremen and office staff I do not know. The firms with which I am connected,notably, for example, Combined English Mills (Spinners) Limited, which is one ofthe largest spinning combines, certainly have them, but there may still be quite alarge number of smaller firms which do not.Annex AI do not think that, so far as my firm is concerned, we should want to contract-out if we were able to do so.Annexes A and BI think that on balance scheme A is the better one because the interests of thehigher paid workers are not prejudiced in favour of those lower down the scale.general  think the principle of establishing an occupational pension scheme to be run by the Government is a good one. It has the result of making it obligatory fora person to provide for his future retirement and to that extent it is a form ofnational saving.Appendix II (xxiv)BEAVER &amp; CO. (BINGLEY) LTD.(Mr. John Foster Beaver, Chairman)Worsted Spinners[No details of pension scheme supplied.]Annexes A and BI would say that proposals would meet with considerable criticism in many quarters, but that if carried through, Annex B would be preferable. I do not think there would be much desire to contract-out of a scheme, but that the right to amendpresent schemes would generally be desired. In the case of B, adaptation would feel be fairly general.
Appendix II (xxv)SWAN, HUNTER, and WIGHAM-RICHARDSON LTD.(Mr. E. J. Hunter, Chairman)Contributory, insured, covers staff only. Employees&apos; contributions vary according to salary band between 4] per cent, and 5^- per cent. Pension is on average salary basis varying according to salary band up to something like two-thirds of average salary. Additional pension may be purchased by voluntary contributions.   Also non-contributory supplementary scheme for senior officials.Proposals under consideration for works scheme in 1959 (nearly 12,000 worksemployees).Annexes A and BIt will be apparent from these figures [specimen contributions and benefits of company&apos;s scheme] that it would be in the best interests of our members to contract-out of the proposed scheme, or failing that to modify the existing scheme.It would obviously be impracticable to consider continuing the present scheme and,in addition, meeting the extra cost of the proposed scheme because the ratio ofaggregate pension to salary would be too high and, what is more important, the combined schemes would impose too heavy a burden of deductions from currentremuneration.Summing up the position so far as this group is concerned, the presentoccupational scheme covers a relatively small proportion of the total number employed and, while at this stage I could not say whether we would contract-contributory modify our existing scheme, we think it highly desirable that there should bea power to take one or the other of these steps. Failing a power to contract-outwe would certainly wish to modify our scheme.Consultation with employeesOur pension schemes are operated through an insurance company by trusteesamongst whom are representatives of the monthly salaried and weekly paid staff.It is noted that the employer will have the right to apply to contract-out withthe consent of the trustees. It is thought that the trustees may be taken as representing the views of the members and therefore, beyond their consent, nofurther consultation with employees would be necessary. While it is not consideredthat the application by the employer to contract-out would lead to any unfavourablereaction on the part of the employee members, it would probably be desirable tocircularise the members with a statement setting out the reasons for contracting-out.Modifications to the present scheme would require the sanction of the trustees.GeneralRegarding the merits of the two alternative schemes proposed, I would say thatAnnex B would be more favourably received, particularly since it concedes animmediate benefit in the shape of reduced contributions for those earning under 8 a week. I would be in favour of Annex B if it were possible to introduce a contracting-out clause. The proposals under either Annex A or B will of course be widespread in their application and the scheme is one which I think requires themost careful consideration and full consultation before it reaches its final form.

Pension is approximately one-third of salary.Annex A[No specific comment see general remarks below.]Annex BOur scheme, being of recent origin, provides a retirement pension related tothe current State pension and therefore if Annex B was adopted our scheme wouldbe modified approximately to the extent of the increased pension under the new state scheme. Having regard to the modification of our own scheme if Annex Bwas adopted I would strongly urge that we should have statutory powers to effectsuch modification.It is exceedingly difficult at this stage to express an opinion as to the reaction of the members of our scheme to Annex B without first ascertaining the revisedcontributions they would be called upon to pay. I feel however, that the higher-paid staff would present no problem but there might be some reaction from themembers in the lower salary grades.general in our opinion, so far as this Company is concerned, the scheme under Annex Bis preferred.Appendix II (xxvii)JEYES&apos; SANITARY COMPOUNDS COMPANY LTD.(Mr. T. B. Brown, Chairman)Compulsory and contributory scheme; covers all employees with not less thanone year&apos;s service between 21 and 60 (men) and 25 and 55 (women) (300 in all).Benefits are at least as high as those proposed in Annex A.Annex AIn the event of Annex A coming on the Statute Book my Company would wishto contract-out of the wage-related part of the State scheme. Our contributoryoccupational scheme will be found, I feel, to satisfy the criteria of equivalence andsolvency but, in common with most other occupational schemes, it does not satisfy the criterion of transferability of pension rights. It is probable, however, that thesubject of enabling legislation to cover this point is in your mind.Annex BIf Annex B were to be enacted, it is probable that our decision would be tomaintain our occupational scheme with few or no adaptations.Consultation with EmployeesAs the decision at which we would arrive under Annex A, or under Annex Bif any adaptation of our occupational scheme is considered desirable, is not inthe nature of the negotiations normally entered into between trade unions and
pi1employers such as those relating to wage awards I feel that it would be incorrectto inform our employees of such a decision through such channels. The matter would be handled on a more domestic basis.The following points are not in the nature of replies to the questions put inyour letter and accompanying document but are, I think, pertinent to the issues involved and have weighed with me in the replies I have given above.The wage-related addition to the present flat-rate scheme, envisaged in annex A, stands away from it in a marked way. Unlike the present fiat-ratescheme in which the contributions are not specifically hypothecated as betweenpension and other benefits, the additional pension resulting from the wage-relatedpart of the scheme is, or may be considered to be, directly calculable. In the document the maximum additional pension on the basis of 3 per cent, interest isgiven as  3 a week. But objection may and probably will be raised to the interestfigure assumed. In present, or possible in average, conditions 3-  or even 4 percent, may be said to be more reasonable, the respective maximum additionalpensions being  4, and over  5, a week. The scheme under Annex B is not onlymore rational and better integrated with the present flat-rate scheme, but thecontributions not being specifically hypothecated against the several benefits, doesnot as easily invite the criticisms that may be levelled against Annex A.I would like to end this letter by casting a doubt as to the need for thelegislation now proposed. The present flat-rate scheme provides in my opinion the desired elements of social security which industry, in its wisdom and in accordancewith its ability, supplements. The two proposals provide only for increasedpensions but not for any increase in other benefits such as sickness and unemployment, a matter which is likely to be seized on and magnified. In anycase I feel that the issues involved are of such import that they should be subjectto the fullest debate.General
Appendix III (i)NATIONAL COAL BOARD, ELECTRICITY COUNCIL, GAS COUNCIL(a) Copy of Letter dated 7 May, 1958, from Minister of Power to Ministerof Pensions and National InsuranceAs requested in your letter of 18th April I have had confidential discussions with the chairmen of the nationalised coal, electricity and gas industries on the impact on their pensions schemes of a national scheme on the lines outlined in annexes A and B of the memorandum enclosed with your letter.The summary of the information given me is rather lengthy to incorporatein a letter and may be more useful to you in the form of a memorandum, which Ienclose. There are, however, one or two points which I would like to make in thelight of my discussion with the chairmen.The first is that the possibility of substantial increases in pensions benefits is amatter of some concern to all three chairmen in the light of the benefits securedto their employees under their industry schemes which, apart from the mineworkers,may already be considered adequate. The National Coal Board, in particular, arealso very concerned about the cost of such increases. They would be especiallyaffected by changes of the kind contemplated because of the higher labour element in production costs, and their present financial difficulties cause their chairmen toview with alarm any proposals for cost increases.I estimate that if Annex A scheme was introduced and none of the industryschemes for which I am responsible was contracted-out, the Boards&apos; totaladditional costs in contributions, based on some 1-08 million employees, might amount to nearly  8 millions a year of which just over  6 millions would have to beborne by the National Coal Board.If all these schemes, including the mineworkers&apos; scheme (which covers some562,000 employees) were contracted-out of the top tier of Annex A, additionalcosts would still arise in respect of those employees who are not members of theschemes. At a rough estimate this additional cost to the Boards might amount to just over  1 million a year, as follows:  Employees  Coal     .........      102,000 827,000Electricity      ......       54,000 262,000Gas      .........        13,500 65,000If the mineworkers did not contract-out of Annex A but substituted it fortheir own scheme, this might put up the Coal Board&apos;s additional costs of  827,000by a net figure of about  2 millions a year.The introduction of Annex B without any adaptation of existing industryschemes, might cost the Boards  84- millions a year, of which the National coal board might have to bear about  6 - millions. Even if in spite of the complicationsand difficulties, all these industry schemes were so adapted as to obviate any additional cost to the employers in respect of existing members of their schemes,as well as new entrants, the national scheme would still cost the Boards about 1^ millions a year in respect of those employees outside the schemes, including 900,000 from the National Coal Board.But the mineworkers&apos; scheme with its comparatively low benefits could notbe cut back in the same way as the staff schemes; it might be discontinued on the advent of Annex B in which case the net costs to the Coal Board, additional to the 900,000 to which I refer above, might be about  2-^- millions a year.Secondly, all three Chairmen emphasised the personal nature of the viewsthey have expressed in the absence of any consultation with the management committees of their schemes, on which employers and members are represented,or with the unions. They point to the necessity of such consultations in advanceof any further information for which they may be asked.
(b) Memorandum on Minister of Power&apos;s Consultations with Chairmen of national coal Board, Electricity Council and Gas council the three chairmen were asked for their advice on how far their industryschemes would be affected by national schemes as outlined in and described as annex A and Annex B. In particular (i) To what extent would their employees be contracted-out of the graduatedpart (top tier) of Annex A?(ii) Under Annex B (and Annex A to the extent that employees are notcontracted out) What adaptations of their occupational schemes would appeardesirable to avoid the aggregated contributions and pensions under national and occupational schemes being excessive?(iii) What is the nature and extent of the consultations required with their employees in connection with (a) Contracting-out of Annex A (top tier), bearing in mind that theinitiative lies with the employer?(b) the adaptation of their schemes to avoid excessive contributions and pensions?Annex A PreferredAll three industries have pension schemes covering their staff and manual workers (the latest is for gas manuals which is planned to come into effect on1st June). The three chairmen all expressed, on the information given them, theirstrong preference for Annex A over Annex B scheme for all their employees, because it provides an option to contract-out of those benefits and contributions which wouldbe additional to those under the present national insurance scheme.Importance of the Option to Contract-out this option to contract-out is considered by the chairmen to be of veryconsiderable importance because the higher benefits envisaged under either of these schemes, when added to the industry scheme retirement benefits, would become so large in relation to salary as to be a disincentive to employees to remain at workbeyond minimum retiring age. They assume that this would be contrary to anyGovernments policy with the result that, where it arises, steps would have to betaken to remove it.Excessive pensions the coal, gas and electricity staff schemes already provide at age 65, and after40 years service, a retirement pension of two-thirds retiring salary (or its equivalent of one-half retiring salary plus a lump sum); for all new entrants to the schemes since1948 these pensions are abated by 26s. a week in respect of the national pension but,with its increase to 50s. a week, a single man&apos;s total pension after 40 years may nowbe equivalent to over 70 per cent, of his salary (over 80 per cent, if a married man).Adaptation of SchemesIt is recognised that for the first 10 years or so of the new national scheme theadditional pension payable under Annex A would not be very large (5s. in the caseof a  15 a week man after 10 years), but the scheme is based on additional benefitsrising to 45s. after 40 years and 60s. after 50 years and accordingly the alternative to contracting-out of these additional benefits must, in the view of the chairmen, leadto adaptation of their own industry staff schemes. This, it is thought, would beregarded as involving loss of existing benefits and would arouse serious discontent among those affected and strong resistance from the Unions, though it would be accompanied by a reduction in contributions to the industry scheme, and evenperhaps though such adaptation was restricted to new entrants.Con tracting-O u tThe Boards of the three industries would therefore wish to contract-out fromthe graduated part of Annex A all their pensions schemes and retain these intact.The chairmen think (i) the members of the staff schemes would readily accept this;
(ii) the same applies to the electricity manual workers&quot; scheme, but notnecessarily to their protected workers&apos; schemes, some of which providevery poor benefits;(iii) the gas manual workers&apos; scheme, which is to provide roughly only half staffscheme benefits and would not give rise to excessive pensions, probablymeets the requirements of the gas workers who should therefore beprepared for the scheme to be contracted-out.Members AffectedBased on this advice some 312,000 workers in these three industries would becontracted-out of the top tier of Annex A scheme, or up to 350,000 if members ofelectricity pre-vesting schemes should be included.MineworkersThere is considerable doubt about the workers&apos; attitude to contracting-out the mineworkers&apos; scheme which has a present membership of nearly 600,000.The introduction of a national scheme with higher benefits than at presentwould clearly not be without interest to the miner; the maximum benefit he can get under his industry scheme is 30s. which is just under one-half the total pensionhe would get as a single man (including the present national retirement benefit), butthe raising of the maximum national scheme benefit by up to  3 a week would make his industry scheme benefit seem very small.Price for Contracting-Out Costly Improvements to scheme the National Coal Board would prefer that, if possible, the industry scheme should continue to provide a substantial part of the miner&apos;s retirement benefits, andto contract-out of the top tier of Annex A, but the chairman finds it impossible to say,without consultation with the Union, whether the men&apos;s reaction would be the same.He has little doubt that, as a price for contracting-out of Annex A, the miner would want substantial improvements in the mineworkers&apos; scheme (which the Boardcannot afford at present) and the Union might, therefore, prefer to take the fullnational scheme in substitution of their own scheme; to take it in addition to theirown scheme would cost most of them another 4s. a week in contributions.Assume Mineworkers Scheme May Not Contract-out at present, therefore, it should not be assumed that the mineworkers&apos; would becontracted-out of Annex A scheme.Annex B and Excessive pensions the introduction of Annex B would give rise to the same problem of excessivepensions as under Annex A, but since it includes no provision for contracting-out of benefits in excess of those at present provided, the effect on all industry schemes,except perhaps the mineworkers&apos; scheme, would be more keenly felt. The amountby which the industry scheme benefits would be cut back would not necessarily be quite as big because the maximum pension which could be earned under Annex Bis theoretically not so large ( 2 as against  3 for a single man), but without furtheradaptation the increases generally would be higher than under Annex A.Effect of Compulsory Adaptation of Industry schemes the chairmen regard the possibility of further adaptation of their schemes,without any alternative with considerable concern because it would be so stronglyresented by the members who would see their Boards taking away from them whatParliament had given. When the present modification arrangements were introduced in 1948 and a distinction had to be made between existing members andnew entrants, this gave rise, and still gives rise to considerable feeling; furthercompulsory adaptations involving reduction in benefits, even on a basis of reducedcontributions, would aggravate this situation.Adaptation Necessary to Reduce Additional Costs of Annex BNevertheless the chairmen are firmly of the opinion that their schemes wouldhave to be adapted in order to reduce the additional costs which would otherwise fall upon the Board. The National Coal Board estimate that the introduction of annex B would cost them in respect of members of the mineworkers&apos; scheme, if notadapted, an additional  5 millions a year.
Appendix III (ii)SCOTTISH ELECTRICITY BOARDS-Extract of Letter dated 21st May, 1958, from Secretary of State for Scotland to minister of Pensions and National InsuranceVery briefly, the answers to the three specific questions which you asked inparagraph 4 of the memorandum you sent me on 18th April are:  (1) If Annex A were adopted the Boards would prefer to contract-out their employees; that means that the great majority of the Boards&apos; employeeswould be contracted-out since 80 per cent, of the eligible manual workers and most of the other staff of both Boards are members of their existing schemes, which provide comparable benefits.(2) If Annex B applies or if there is no contracting-out of Annex A the Boardscould modify their schemes in the same way as they are already modified to take some account of national insurance contributions benefits.(3) Neither Board is required to consult the employees&apos; side of the industry in framing or modifying superannuation schemes, but in practice bothBoards do so.Appendix III (iii) (a)BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION(Sir Brian Robertson, Chairman)Extract from Memorandum submitted by Commission to Minister of TransportGeneral Considerations on the ProposalsIt would make for greater flexibility and lessen difficulties in adapting existing schemes if it were permissible for distinction to be drawn between various groups ofstaff, for instance, under Annex A:  (a) to contract-out for existing staff, but not for future entrants;(b) to contract-out for male wages staff, but not for female wages staff.Consultations w!th Unions and Staff Associations on Contracting-out a decision to contract-out one or all of their schemes from the top tierof Annex A would not in itself involve any amendment of existing industry schemes,save in respect of transferability, but all three chairmen feel it would be necessaryto consult trade unions and staff associations before taking any such action.Questions of alternatives to contracting-out would arise and the Boards would wislito feel assured that they carried their employees with them on any proposal affectingthem so closely.Consultations on Adaptation to schemes the rules of all these industry schemes (except the mineworkers&apos; scheme)provide for alterations in contributions and benefits to be made by the employer inthe event of changes in National Insurance legislation. While this provisionoverrules other provisions under which a majority of two-thirds of contributorsaffected must approve any proposal to reduce the benefits of an existing member ofthe industry scheme, the chairmen consider it would be essential to have informal discussions with the trade unions and staff associations before any amendment ormajor modification to their schemes was introduced.Under the rules of the mineworkers&apos; scheme any proposed amendments mustbe agreed with the Union before submission for the Ministers approval, and no alteration may be made which would have the effect of reducing the amount of anybenefits already earned or accrued. If the Board and the Union are unable to agree on any amendment which the Board wish to make, the matter becomes a question under the conciliation scheme for the industry.
Annex ADealing in detail with the Annex A proposals, a number of points emerge.Considerations to to Salaried Staff(i) It would be virtually impossible for the maximum benefit to be obtainedbecause salary progression is usually steady through the grades, and theaverage retiring salary for men on British Railways after long service isprobably no higher than about  650 a year at the moment.(ii) Even with the present modifications of the main superannuation funds theaccrual of benefits is substantially greater than under Annex A(iii) The logical course would seem to be to contract-out, at any rate for existing staff. The alternative would be to make further complicatedmodifications in the superannuation funds to take account of the new state pension arrangements, although inequalities might well result fromthe differing actuarial bases of the funds and the State scheme.(iv) Again logically, the course would seem to be to rely on the Annex Aproposals (by not contracting-out) for future entrants, and to close the superannuation funds to new entrants. There would, however,undoubtedly be opposition from the trade unions to what would be aworsening of the overall arrangements for new entrants, unless somesupplementary arrangements were introduced.Considerations as to Wages Staff(i) British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grades) Pension Scheme(a) At the  12 10s. level, contributions and benefits seem to correspondfairly closely with the Annex A proposals. This may, or maynot, satisfy the first criterion for contracting-out.(b) For men earning, say,  13 to  15 a week consistently for long periods, Annex A may prove better; therefore there could be nocontracting-out for existing staff or new entrants, but closure ofthe British Transport Commission scheme might have to follow.The Commission^ approach might be conditioned by the views of other employers, and the attitude of both employers and employees could well depend onthe scale of State pension in relation to contributions. If, as is suggested, theproposals are based on 3 per cent, interest accumulation, a smaller benefit would beproduced for like contributions than in the British Transport Commission salariedfunds (usually 4 per cent, accumulation) and the male wages grades scheme (34- percent, accumulation). It may be that this would also be true of the majority of occupational schemes, whether self-administered or insured.If that were so, there would probably be:  (a) a reluctance on the part of employers and staff to acceptance of thearrangements in Annex A in preference to existing arrangements.(b) pressure on employers to supplement Annex B benefits.No mention is made of death and ill-health retirement benefits in the proposals,a serious disadvantage compared with the Commission^ schemes. TheCommission^ salaried schemes also permit of optional retirement at or after age 60for men (55 for women).For like contributions the &quot; money purchase&quot; basis would producesubstantially lower pension for women than for men, because of the earlierretirement age for women and women&apos;s lighter mortality at advanced ages.An unexplained feature is that the Annex A scheme would provide anadditional pension of  3 a week, and under Annex B the graduated pension wouldbe  2 a week (or less) above the standard rate, whereas under Annex A and Annex Bthe total contributions for men in the  10 to  15 band would seem to be withincoppers of each other; similarly for women earning  10 to  15 a week.
-    183% SECRET 41(c) Men earning less than  13 a week would be worse off underAnnex A. Supplementary arrangements would therefore be needed if there were no contracting-out, and the British transport commission scheme would have to be modified. This would undoubtedly be somewhat complicated.id) Contracting-out might well be precluded because contributions arenot alienated from the Commission.(ii) Ex-gratia ArrangementsContracting-out might be precluded because the arrangements are notcontributory; there is the further difficulty of equivalence of benefits in different forms, i.e.,&apos; in comparing lump sums and pensions. But, if the male wages grade scheme were to be modified to take account of the State pension arrangements, this might similarly be done for the ex-gratia arrangements.Other Considerations(i) Generally, it would be difficult, in considering whether or not there shouldbe contracting-out, to decide on equivalence of benefits when comparing the flat rate benefits of the Commission^ wages grade arrangements and the graduated State pension proposals.(ii) If the Commission were to contract-out for any section of the staff, theirprovisions for preservation of pension rights would require alteration.The Government proposals would leave many small cold-storagepensions in occupational schemes, and provision for a cash payment tothe State, which might then become responsible, would be preferable.Annex BOn the Annex B proposals, the principal considerations are:  Considerations as to Salaried staff the Commission^ existing schemes are better than those proposed. Thecourse would, therefore, have to be that the present basis of benefits wouldhave to be maintained for existing staff by modification of the schemes, leavingthose schemes to pay the balance of existing benefits, or by supplementation.To rely simply on Annex B for new entrants would lead to opposition by trade Unions on the grounds of worsening of conditions. Other largeemployers would probably find themselves in the same position.Considerations as to Wages staff the Annex B benefits would be better for a few, but worse for most,compared with existing arrangements. Some supplementation fromCommission sources would, therefore, be necessary.ConclusionsIt would be possible to contract-out from Annex A for existing salariedstaff, and leave future entrants to be covered by the proposals. There would,however, be Union opposition to this latter suggestion.Equally, it would seem feasible to contract-out of Annex A for lower-gradedwages staff who have pension cover, but not for certain senior pensionable wagesstaff. The Unions would be likely to oppose contracting-out as they would clearly desire the best of both arrangements, and the difficulty would be in decidingwhere the line should be drawn, and where supplementation would be required.Under Annex B, some betterment from Commission sources would seem tobe inevitable, since there would be no contracting-out.Instinctively, the thought of being able to contract-out where benefits areduplicated is attractive. But past exception from the State pension arrangementsfor salaried staff has, looking back, had disastrous effects for them in the lack
of the State pension for them unless they became voluntary contributors. Itwould seem wise not to allow the same situation to arise again by contracting-out,quite apart from difficulties contracting-out might bring with the Unions.If the Commission were to contract-out, they would be under implicitobligation to maintain future benefits from their schemes at least at the Statepension level.To safeguard the future as regards the individuals and the State scheme,it would seem on balance that the Commission ought not to seek to contract-out for any of their staff, but to take advantage to the full of any proposal as regardsState pension, and modify as necessary their own arrangements, which wouldproperly be supplementary to those of the State.If, however, this is accepted, the modification of the Commission^ schemes should be on a realistic basis related to the factual State pension and not to the1948 rates of State pension. It is assumed that Ministerial Regulations wouldbe authoritative on this aspect.Modifications of the Commission^ schemes, which might prove complicated,would be a matter for the Commission to discuss with the Trade Unions, priorto any request for Ministerial Regulations; but acceptance of modification by theTrade Unions might be difficult to obtain, except in the knowledge that the samecourse would be followed by the Civil Service, Local Government and the other nationalised Industries.Appendix III (iii) (b)BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS  corporation british EUROPEAN AIRWAYS(Sir Gerard d&apos;Erlanger, Chairman, Airline Chairmen&apos;s Committee)Extract from letter dated 19th May, 1958, from Sir Gerard d&apos;Er!anger to minister of transport the following are our views on the proposals:  (a) As you know, there are two alternative proposals put forward and, fromthe information available, it would almost certainly seem that the corporations would prefer scheme A to scheme B. The mainadvantage in our eyes of scheme A is that there is provision for contracting-out in respect of certain categories of employees.(b) Since it appeared obvious that the Corporations&apos; pension scheme as itat present stands produces better benefits than either of the proposedState schemes, the right to contract-out if scheme A was adopted would almost certainly be exercised. It appeared that the Corporations&apos;scheme satisfies the proposed criteria for contracting-out on the points made regarding equivalence and solvency. The arrangements fortransferability so as to ensure preservation of pension rights would undoubtedly, however, require further attention to bring them into line with the proposals set out in your paper.(c) If scheme B was adopted in view of the proposal that there would beno option to contract-out, substantial alterations to the Airwayspension scheme would be necessary. The extent of such alterationscannot be assessed without considerably more detailed knowledge ofthe proposed scheme B.(d) As it is visualised that the adoption of either scheme A or scheme B wouldrequire material alterations in the rules of the Corporations&apos; pension scheme, we consider that such changes would require prior consultation and agreement with the Trade Unions on the National Joint Council;in this context, it can be assumed that there would be little or no prospect of reaching agreement with the Unions on any points whichhad the effect of lowering the pension, or increasing the contributionwithout a commensurate increase in benefits.
(e) Should this State scheme provide higher pension benefits (by either ofthe alternatives), it would almost certainly be necessary to amend thepresent rules so far as to deal with the exclusion from the calculation of pension and contributions of the first  100 per annum of pay.This figure would probably have to be increased, either to a pre-determined fixed amount or by way of percentage of pay.(/) The proposed alternatives to the State pension scheme referred to earnings and not basic pay and this can present administrative difficulties owingto fluctuating earnings. It is suggested that it would be an administrative convenience if deductions from pay were calculated on the earnings of a preceding period, e.g., the preceding twelve months or six months.(g) As a general comment, it is hoped that you will not find it necessary to cancel your existing regulations governing the pension schemes ofthe Corporations in order to meet the Government policy on Statepension schemes. It is hoped that whatever plans are finally agreed on.employers should be given the facility to adapt their schemes ratherthan have to replace them. The general policy on which such alterationswould be based would be the maintenance of the existing total benefitsby a combination of State and occupational schemes.
Appendix IVPUBLIC SERVICES(Civil Service, Local Government. National Health Service, Teachers. police and Firemen)At a meeting under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on1st April, 1958, departments concerned with pensions for the Civil Service, LocalGovernment, the National Health Service and teachers expressed the view that ifthe September scheme [now represented by Annex A of the working document at appendix I] were adopted, most of those concerned would on balance be in favourof contracting-out. A note of the conclusions of this meeting has been circulatedto all Ministers affected.Subsequently the departmental Ministers concerned were sent a copy of theworking document (Appendix I) for any further comments they wished to make.In general Ministers do not wish to amplify what was said at the meeting, except thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland wishes to withdraw the suggestion made on his behalf that police and fire authorities in Scotland might not contract-cut.The Minister of Education makes the following additional comment onAnnex B of the Working Document (i.e., the August Scheme):  &quot; There can be no doubt, in my opinion, that both the teachers and their employers would, under Annex B, demand that modification of the teachers&apos;pension scheme should be extended to cover all additional National insurance benefits above the 26s. per week already covered. This, if indeed it is practicable, would be tantamount to contracting-out, and would involve very complicated and expensive administration. Moreover, such a demand wouldbe sound in principle, for the problem of excessive pensions is probably moreacute in the teachers&apos; scheme than in other public services. Successivelegislation has brought us to the position that many teachers will from now on be retiring on a pension based on 40 years or more of pensionable service.Their benefits already exceed two-thirds of retiring salary, and we could not reasonably expect additional contributions to be paid for further unwantedand excessive benefits.&quot;The Secretary of State for Scotland also makes an additional comment onAnnex B:  &quot; Adaptation of occupational schemes would certainly have to beconsidered if we had the scheme in Annex B, and would be controversial.Teachers, for example, would think a total employee&apos;s contribution of 9f percent, burdensome but the corollary of some reduction in it &apos; abatement&apos; of teachers&apos; pension beyond the present rate of 26s. a week would not be easy to impose. With policemen and firemen, who are already entitled to a two-thirds pension after 30 years service, the problem is even worse, for weshould presumably have to try to &apos; abate&apos; the service pension by an amount equal to the whole of the new national pension.....&quot; It will be recalled that the teachers&apos; associations were consulted about the modifications to service pensions required in 1948, and there is specific provision for pension matters in the joint machinery for the police and fire services. The Police Council in particular would have to be with us if wewere to have any hope of passing without the most acute controversy the bill that will be necessary if we are to tamper with the safeguard for pensions of serving members which was written into the Police Pensions Act, 1948.&quot;On the question of police and firemen in England and Wales the Home Office(who were not represented at the meeting of 1st April, 1958) have made thiscomment:  &quot; On the assumption that there could be only one decision for each ofthe services as a whole, our view is that, as police and fire officers meet lessthan one-quarter of the cost of their pensions and the pensions schemes of thetwo services are already more expensive than other public service pensions schemes because of the early age of retirement, the attitude of police and fire
authorities would be influenced largely by financial considerations. If, asseems possible, on the information at present available, they would incuradditional expenditure by remaining in the scheme, they are likely to exercise their right to ask that scheme A should not extend to police and fire officers.Fire authorities and, to a lesser extent, police authorities are however also likely to be influenced by whatever decision is reached about the applicationof the scheme to local government employees.On the second question, on the best estimates we can make without consulting the local authorities or the Commissioner of Police, we have noreason to suppose that the additional contributions involved in either scheme would in themselves create real difficulty either for serving officers or for police and fire authorities, though it may be contended otherwise by representativesof the police or the authorities. If, as we understand is likely, it was considered necessary to provide for the abatement of public service pensions at age 65 toensure that the combined service and State awards did not exceed two-thirds of retiring pay, it appears to us that this would deprive police and fire officersof virtually all the additional benefits which the schemes are intended toprovide, so that the payment of additional contributions would be made without a corresponding return and this would be greatly resented.The answer to the third question is that there would have to be consultationwith the Police Council for Great Britain and Central Fire Brigade AdvisoryCouncil.&quot;
Appendix V (i)LIFE OFFICES ASSOCIATION(Mr. J. H. Kitten, Chairman)ASSOCIATED SCOTTISH LIFE OFFICES(Mr. K. K. WeatherheacK Chairman)INTRODUCTIONFirst, we wish to make it very clear that whatever scheme may ultimatelv been acted our two Associations and our individual members would do their utmost to assist Government in making it a good and workable scheme.Secondly, the subject is one which touches us closely and in the interim period between the Governments intentions becoming public knowledge and the passingof the necessary legislation we would wish to comment freely and maybe forcibly on certain aspects.This memorandum is divided into five parts:  I. General Views of Life Offices.II. Background Information.III.-Study of Scheme A.IV.-Study of Scheme B.V. Suggestion by Life Offices.Part IGENERAL VIEWS OF LIFE OFFICESWe think that we should begin this memorandum by stating in general terms the views of the Life Offices regarding the provision of pensions by the State. Webelieve that the State should confine its activities to making provision for &quot; basicneed,&quot;&apos; leaving to thrift and private enterprise the development of pensions beyond this level. Obviously we recognise that what constitutes &quot; basic need &quot; is debatableand we do not rule out the idea that a small graded pension element might reasonably be included in any State provision for &quot; basic need.&quot; // any scheme were intended tomake provision beyond &quot; basic need,&quot; then we would oppose it for that reason.Any State pensions scheme must have financial discipline. One such disciplinewould be for the contributions paid in respect of any graded pension element to becarried to a separate fund and accumulated at interest, this fund not to be takento offset the growing deficit under the existing National Insurance scheme nor tobe &quot; raided &quot; in any way. We shall, however, assume that this approach will notbe adopted, but we felt that we should mention it for the sake of completeness.We believe that any State scheme confined to &quot; basic need &quot; should be of&quot; quick maturity &quot;; in other words, even the older members of the population should be able to qualify for some reasonable proportion of any graded element the limiting factor being the level which the National finances could support. Thegreat importance of this principle of &quot; quick maturity &quot; which in practice means that a scheme would be largely financed on a &quot; pay-as-you-go &quot; basis and include some element of past service is that the quicker the maturity of a scheme of gradedpensions the firmer is the financial discipline imposed on the Government of the day.Under a &quot; quick maturing&quot; scheme it would be more difficult for a future government to enlarge the scheme by promising bigger pensions at some remotefuture date without at the same time increasing the pension rates for those already
nearing pension age. Thus any increase in benefit would be reflected more quicklyin the burden on the Exchequer and so some financial discipline would bemaintained.It is inevitable owing to the growing proportion of old people to the working population that any National Insurance scheme providing pensions must face rising costs any scheme of a &quot; slow maturing &quot; nature must aggravate this feature.The idea of &quot; quick maturity &quot; is fundamental to our appreciation of theNational position. We regard with uneasiness any State scheme which relatespensions for present employees to future contributory service only: it is slow tomature and promises a remote disbursement of benefits for an immediate collection-of contributions. Such a scheme could place a very heavy remote burden on theExchequer in years to come in return for an immediate relief by way of collectionof contributions. Further, it would always be a temptation as Governmentsucceeded Government for the process to be repeated for increases to be made in immediate contributions in return for increases in remote pensions resulting in further immediate relief to the Exchequer and a further burden on futuregenerations. We greatly fear the dangers of this cumulative process both for theNation and for our industry.Part IIBACKGROUND information the activity of the Life Offices in recent years in providing pensions schemeshas resulted in some of the largest Offices in the country deriving over one-half their total life premium income from pensions business. In addition, provision for old age has been made by means of endowment assurance policies effected through boththe ordinary and the industrial branches of the Life Offices. It is of the utmost importance that nothing should be done which could lead to serious damage tothe Life Offices and through them to the insurance industry as a whole.The following figures are extracted from Table 24 of &quot; National Income andExpenditure, 1957 &quot; published in August 1957:  Distribution of Personal Income, 1956			Number of	Income beforeRange of income before tax			incomes	taxNot under		Under	Thousands	  millions 		 		50		250    .........	6,570	1,300250		300    .........	1,550	425300		400    .........	2,850	995400		500    .........	3,050	1,370500		600    .........	2,950	1,620600		800    .........	4,850	3,360800		1,000    .........	2,450	2,1701,000		1,500    .........	1,100	1,2901,500		2,000    .........	275	4702,000		3,000    .........	180	4353,000		5,000    .........	111	4205,000		10,000    .........	50	33510,000		20,000    .........	12	16020,000 and over .			2	70			26,000	14,420Income not included in the distribution by ranges				2,630Total personal	income    ............			17,050Note.

The table can be recast as follows to indicate the importance to pensionsbusiness of various ranges of income: Group	Range of income before tax	Total amount of income before tax falling within the range shown*		  millions1         .........

Scheme A makesquite substantial provision for (approximately) Group 3 and scheme B makes a smaller provision for (approximately) Groups 2 and 3. We think that the above figures will help to explain the effects which scheme A and scheme B would have on Life Office pension schemes.Part IIISTUDY OF SCHEME ABenefits and ContributionsThe scheme set out in Annex A is based on interest at 3 per cent, and thisappears to be so uncompetitive as to be unrealistic. Table Al illustrates the benefits which would appear to be secured by the scheme. Table A2 compares the gradedpart of the pension with a scale of benefits which would result from using the more realistic interest rate of 4 per cent, (without, however, making any allowance for adminsitrative expenses).Table Al	Weekly contribution		Total weekly pension at age 65 (single				man)	Weekly earnings								throughout life									At	Possible		Age at beginning of scheme					outset	in 10 years	55	45	35	25	16	 	s.   d.	s.    d.	s.   d.	s.    d.	s.    d.	s.    d.	s.	d.8    ......	18    2	20    2	50    0	50    0	50    0	50    0	50	010    ......	18    2	20    2	50    0	50    0	50    0	50    0	50	011    ......	19    9	21    9	51    3	53    0	55    3	58    6	62	012    ......	21    4	23    4	52    6	56    0	60    6	67    0	74	015    ......	26    2	28    2	56    3	65    0	76    3	92    6	110	 note. We have insufficient information (widow&apos;s pension, remarriage, &amp;c.) to reproduceaccurately on the basis of 3 per cent, the figure of  3 a week mentioned in paragraph 2 of Annex A.If we accept this figure the remaining figures seen reasonably consistent on a 3 per cent, interest basis.Table A2	Graded part of weekly pension at age 65 of a man whose weekly	Age at beginning of scheme	earnings throughout working life have been  15		On Annex A basis	On 4 per cent, interest basis	s.    d.	d.55       .........	6    3	7    345       .........	15    0	18    035       .........	26    3	34    025       .........	42    6	57    616       .........	60    0	88    6Note. Despite the lack of information referred to in the note to the previous table, we think thatthe two scales of benefit closely reflect the effect of the difference in the rates of interest used.
An examination of Table A2 leads us to doubt whether any Government couldsponsor a scheme under which the terms were seen to be so poor as compared withthose which might be put forward by private enterprise, and we believe that political pressure would compel the adoption of a more realistic scale of benefits in return forthe contributions paid.&quot; Basic Needs &quot;We would repeat our view that the State should confine its activities to meeting&quot; basic needs.&quot; The above tables show that even on the basis of 3 per cent, interest the developments envisaged in Annex A go beyond what we would have thoughtwas reasonable provision for &quot; basic needs &quot; for young entrants, but fall short ofany such interpretation for older entrants. If a realistic basis of calculation is usedTable A2 shows that the scheme would go far beyond the provision of &quot; basicneeds &quot; for young entrants in the case of a married man the combined fiat andgraded pension could reach  7 a week (or more) but that older entrants would belittle affected.// is a fundamental truth that a &quot; money purchase &quot; scheme of the characterset out in Annex A is quite unsuitable for dealing with &quot; basic needs.&quot; Indeed any form of contributory future service scheme is unsuitable; &quot;basic needs&quot; are, bydefinition, immediate and cannot be dealt with appropriately by such schemes.The very slow maturity of the scheme would make it highly vulnerable to the dangers which we have discussed in Part I of this memorandum.Effect on business of Life OfficesIt is exceedingly difficult to make any estimate of the reduction in business which would be suffered by the Life Assurance Offices as a result of the developments set out in Annex A. The extent of &quot; contracting-out &quot; would dependon the following factors:  (a) Would the terms granted by the State in fact be competitive with thosegranted by private enterprise?(b) Would political reasons, possibilities of friction between employer and employees, possibilities of future subsidy of the State scheme, &amp;c, leademployers and their advisers to avoid &quot; contracting-out&quot;?(c) How many private schemes would fail to qualify for &quot; contracting-out &quot; onaccount of inadequate size (contributions and benefits) or on account ofinadequate solvency?(d) What would be the relative administrative problems from the point ofview of employers of &quot; contracting-out&quot; on the one hand and&quot; modifying &quot; their private schemes on the other?Existing business would be lost through employers modifying their existing schemes to allow for the new State scheme; on the other hand, a certain amountof new business might be secured more quickly than would otherwise have beenthe case through employers accelerating the adoption of new schemes in order tobe able to &quot; contract-out&quot; of the new State scheme. It is impossible to estimate the net effect on the pensions business of Life Assurance Offices; on the one hand,if the State scheme were uncompetitive there would be an accretion of business to the Life Offices: on the other hand, if the State were competitive or evensubsidised the Life Offices would lose a considerable amount of business.General problemsThere are certain general problems that would be created by any scheme suchas that set out in Annex A. There are three main reasons for grave concern and&apos;these may be stated briefly as follows:  (a) Direct competition between the State and the private sector(i) In general terms we are concerned and indeed we think that theState also should be concerned at the idea of the State entering into direct competition with the private sector. Table A2 show show uncompetitive and indeed how unrealistic would be therates of benefit secured by the basis set out in Annex A. Werepeat that we do not believe that as Government succeededGovernment the State could stand in the market offering pensionson terms which were not competitive with those offered by privateenterprise.
(ii) This form of competition, where one of the competitors the State would not be inhibited by commercial considerations, does,however, cause us concern. It would be so easy for some government at some time to quote rates of benefit which werenot commercially sound, to add &quot; fringe &quot; benefits, e.g., gradedwidows&apos; pensions for which no proper charge was made, to incorporate some &quot; escalator clause &quot; linking the benefits to thecost of living. These are the kind of actions which the private sector would be unable to take and they might lead to seriousfriction where employers had &quot; contracted-out&quot; of the State&apos;scheme.(b) Labour relations(i) We note in Annex A that responsibility for &quot; contracting-out&quot; after consultation with the employees is to rest on the employer and that once the decision has been taken that a pension scheme will &quot; contract-out&quot; of the State scheme individual employees in that firm will have no choice of staying in the State scheme.With respect and our knowledge of the negotiations whichtake place in arranging pension schemes is very extensive wewould have thought that such an arrangement was fraught withdangers of friction between employer and employee. pension schemes, whether State or private, do not remain static and itwould seem a thousand pities to introduce a scheme whichcould provide a source of friction between employer and employee according to whether it appeared on any particularchange that those who had &quot;contracted-out&quot; were betterfavoured or less v/ell favoured than those who had not.(ii) On the other hand, the giving of the option to individual employees while attractive from the point of view that it would moderatethe need for &quot; control &quot; by the State of schemes which had&quot; contracted-out &quot; has drawbacks. Apart from problems ofadministration, controls might have to be introduced to preventthe disruption of perfectly good private pension schemes owingto all the young employees going into the State scheme becauseof the better transferable pensions at young ages leaving onlythe older lives in the private pension scheme.(c) Possibility of future subsidy(i) If a scheme were in fact started on the lines suggested in Annex Apolitical pressure for &quot; quicker maturity,&quot; i.e., for better pensions for the older employee, would become great, most probablyleading to the State scheme becoming subsidised.(ii) The effect of the fall in the purchasing power of the   on pensionsis most clearly shown by the history of the various increases inpensions which have been proved necessary under the national insurance scheme. It appears to us inevitable that sooner or later the State graded pensions would prove to be inadequate and that the State would therefore have to take action. TheState itself might well provide in whole or in part by way of subsidy the amounts necessary to secure the required increases in pensions; it appears to us most improbable from a political point of view that the State would, in fact, be prepared to face the odium of increasing adequately the employers&apos; and employees&apos; contributions. (The past history of pensions underthe National Insurance scheme would appear to justify thisbelief.)(iii) Any developments such as envisaged in the previous paragraphswould be disastrous for those schemes which had &quot; contracted-out.&quot; Pressure would be brought upon employers to increasethe benefits under their schemes to &quot; keep in step &quot; with theState scheme, and they would therefore be faced with the double burden of the increased cost of their own private schemes and the increased (general) taxation necessary to finance thesubsidy to the State scheme.
&quot; Contracting-out &quot;It appears to us that the scheme set out in Annex A has been created largelyfor the purpose of enabling contracting-out &quot; to take place. If the contributions were commercially sound and the scheme were properly funded and maintained in its strict integrity, and if employers and their advisers believed that it wouldbe so maintained, then &quot; contracting-out&quot; might take place on a substantial scale. If, however, our appreciation of the position is correct-particularly inthat subsidy might be forced into the scheme then employers and their adviserswould not be justified in holding this belief nor in fact would they hold it and&quot; contracting-out&quot; would prove to be temporary and its effectiveness illusory.We are alarmed by the damage that could be done.to the life assurance industry by such a scheme as envisaged in Annex A and by the damage that would bedone to the accumulation of private savings by its adoption, and we would oppose the scheme.administration the administrative problems of &quot; contracting-out,&quot; e.g., the problems of&quot; equivalence,&quot; &quot; solvency &quot; and &quot; transferability &quot;; the problems of &quot; modifying &quot;schemes which did not wish to &quot;contract-out&quot;; all these are vast and complex.Even in the simplest setting over five years would be necessary to enable ail those concerned Inland Revenue, employers, consulting actuaries, pensions advisers,Life Assurance Offices, &amp;c. to carry through the various arrangements consequent upon the enactment of the scheme.Part IVSTUDY OF SCHEME BGeneral comment the first general observation which we would wish to offer on the developmentsset out in Annex B is to comment on the linking of the cost of the fiat benefits to a graded contribution.  Two very important things are achieved:  First, an immediate diminution of the burden on the lowest-paid workers,and secondly, the great advantage that in the event of earnings risingcontributions rise before the granting of a demand for increased flat benefits.We cannot help but feel after much thought that if only a &quot; quicker maturity &quot;element could be introduced into Annex B the scheme set out therein would beincomparably healthier than that set out in Annex A. The scheme would then have the important discipline to which we have already referred in Part I ofthis memorandum inherent in &quot;quick maturity&quot; and &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot;; this principle was perhaps best expressed to us by a leading American actuary whoremarked that a National pension scheme was only healthy when it was insolvent!Benefits and contributions from the information available the following figures have been compiled:  -Table B	Weekly contributions		Total weekly pension at age 65 (single				man)	Weekly earnings								throughout life									At	Possible		Age at beginning of scheme					outset	in 10 years	55	45	35	25	16	 	s.    d.	s.   d.	s.    d.	d.	s.    d.	s.    d.	j.	d.8    ......	13    7	15    2	50    0	50    0	50    0	50    0	50	010    ...	17    0	19    0	52    6	55    0	57    6	60    0	60	011    ...	18    8	20   11	53    9	57    6	61     3	65    0	65	012    ......	20    5	22   10	55    0	60    0	65    0	70    0	70	015    ......	25    6	28    6	58    9	67    6	76    3	85    0	85	 note. The table is based on 1 /160th or lid. per   per year, maximum 5s.
Part VSUGGESTION  BY  LIFE  OFFICESGeneral CommentWe are very conscious that we have criticised and rejected the suggestionsput forward in Annex A and Annex B and we believe it to be our duty to make some positive comments. In offering these comments we shall make twoassumptions:  First, that some graded pension element will, in fact, be introduced intothe National Insurance scheme within the concept of &quot; basic need.&quot; Afterexhaustive examination of the problem, however, we are left wondering whetherthe difficulties and dangers of this course should not, in fact, lead theGovernment to adhere to the existing flat pension benefit system.Secondly, that the contributions collected in respect of a graded pensionelement would be used in meeting the current and growing annual deficit underthe National Insurance scheme, and that they would not in fact be whollycarried to a separate fund accumulating at interest to be used only for thepayment of graded pensions benefits.Benefits and contributions in pursuance of our wish to quicken the maturity of the scheme set out in annex B we suggest that instead of the gradation being based on 1 jd. per   per year with a maximum of 5s. per   it should be based on Id. per   per year with a minimum of at least 2s. per   operating at age 55, and a maximum of, say, 4s. 6d. per   at age25 (i.e., 10 years at 1 / 100th plus 30 years at 1 /240th).Note. The exact application of the 11100th and the 11240th is a matter ofgreat importance one possible application would be that the first 10 years ofevery man&apos;s service after the inception of the scheme would rank for 1/ 100th,the remainder of his service ranking for 1 / 240th; the total fraction would beapplied to his average earnings throughout working life (any earnings below 416 or above  780 in any one year not to rank).The first point which we wish to make regarding the scheme set out in annex B is that while we would accept it as not going beyond our idea of &quot; basicneed &quot; in size, it has little element of &quot; quick maturity &quot; in it; in fact, it is nearly as slow in maturity as the scheme set out in Annex A. For this reason we oppose the scheme.We regret, too, that it is stated in Annex B that the principles of the scheme&quot; preclude the option to contract-out.&quot; While recognising that in theory thereare some impediments to permitting &quot; contracting-out,&quot; we suggest that thismatter calls for reconsideration having regard to the desire of certain employers to have the opportunity of maintaining their present schemes in full.Effect on Business of Life OfficesWe believe that the adoption of Annex B would, in the long run, mean aconsiderable reduction in the premium income which we might expect to receive from pensions business. We repeat that the scheme lacks the financial discipline of &quot; quick maturity &quot; and so is very liable to grow it is this possibility of growththat causes us alarm.A dministrationWe have no further comments to offer on the developments set out in annex B which, from the point of view of the Life Assurance Offices, would merely be an extension of pensions under the National Insurance scheme, theprinciple of universality continuing to apply. The main problem for our members would be to deal with those existing private schemes which might require to be&quot; modified &quot; the problems would be widespread and complex. It would takeover five years for all the parties involved to carry through the transition.

As regards existing schemes, itis exceptionally difficult to assess what would be the action of employers-the best estimate which we can make is that premiums might suffer a reduction of between10 per cent, and 30 per cent. This overall figure is reached after considering theaction which might be taken by various groups of employers:  Group I. A number of employers would continue their private sectorschemes unchanged that is, they would regard the developments set out herein the same way as at present they regard National Insurance pensions.Group II. A number of employers would modify their private sectorschemes in the sense that contributions and benefits would be diminished to offset wholly or partially the increases under the developments set out here.Group IIIj A number of employers might discontinue private sectorschemes providing small benefits.It will be appreciated that the above percentages are necessarily speculative.For those offices that have specialised in pensions business, however, the reductions would, in any event, be heavy. It is possible, however, that the suggestions putforward in this part of this memorandum would in the long run stimulate the general interest of employers and employees in pensions schemes and that there wouldbe some countervailing increase in pensions business due to employers wishing toprovide better pension schemes and not merely to rely on the State scheme.administration the administrative problems would be similar to those which would arise under Annex B.The benefits shown in Table B would then become:  Table C
VJCONCLUSIONWhatever developments take place the work to be done by the Lite AssuranceOffices will be vast in quantity and complex in character; it is the type of workwhich can only be handled by skilled and experienced manpower. Our supply ofsuch manpower is limited and in many cases it is already fully extended in dealingwith the adjustments necessary following the Finance Act, 1956. We would pleadmost earnestly not only for simplicity in any new scheme that may be introducedbut also in order to remove unnecessary burdens being borne by Life Offices for legislation to extend some of the provisions of the Finance Act, 1956. (See ourletter to the Home Secretary dated the 3rd March, 1958.)We conclude:  First, it is our earnest desire to help Government in the working of any scheme which may become law.Secondly, for the reasons given in this memorandum we would reject theschemes set out in Annex A and Annex B. We believe that the potentialdamage would be so great that our members would resist the adoption of such schemes with all the means at their disposal; we believe that in the scheme in annex A even the anticipated advantages of &quot;contracting-out&quot; would betemporary and illusory.Thirdly, if it is decided to depart from the traditional basis of Hatbenefit for flat contribution, then we would earnestly ask that consideration begiven to a &quot; quick maturing &quot; scheme such as that set out in Part V of thismemorandum. We believe that our members (although, obviously, we havenot been able to consult them) would accept such a scheme.If there is any information which we can add we shall, of course, be only toeglad to do so. We cannot end, however, without expressing our grave doubts fromthe National point of view as to the wisdom of Government entering the field ofgraded pensions gradually built up by virtue of contributions paid. An exhaustivestudy of the subject has led us to fear greatly the long-term effects on the national finances as Government succeeds Government of the State collecting immediatecontributions in return for remote benefits. The temptations and dangers seem too great.
Appendix V (ii)THE ASSOCIATION OF SUPERANNUATION AND PENSIONS FUNDS(Mr. Henry Lesser, Chairman)Copy of letter to Deputy Secretary,Ministry of Pensions and National InsuranceANNEX AAn increase from 50s. to 110s. (married 80s. to 140s.) in pension is suggested -if the maximum additional contributions are paid for the maximum period. It is.of course, unlikely that an entrant at 16 would be earning  15 per week, so that itwould seem that Annex A would in the large majority of cases increase the pensionby well under  3 with presumably no increase of additional pension for a married man, or other benefits (except the limited increase in widow&apos;s benefit mentioned in mr. Carswelfs letter of 7th May). We are, therefore, left wondering whether theproblems connected with contracting-out which were dealt with in my letter toMr. Boyd-Carpenter of 23rd August, 1957, and the considerable administrative problems involved in Annex A are worth facing for the sake of the proposed increase. On balance we feel considerable doubts. As stated below, we do notthink many employers would contract-out though it may be that some employers would appreciate the option to do so in the region where no State subsidy issuggested, i.e., beyond a wage of  10 per week.We have given careful consideration to the suggested criteria for contracting-out.(a) EquivalenceWe are not clear as to whether the 4s. per week mentioned in paragraph 4 isintended as an average per employee or as a minimum for any member we presumethe former. We should like to consider this matter again when more detail,particularly regarding the last sentence, is available.As additional widow&apos;s pension is suggested then presumably the private scheme would have to include widows&apos; benefits before contracting-out could be permitted.(b) SolvencyIt must be realised that in a large number of existing schemes the employer is not legally liable to pay contributions indefinitely, nor in most cases does he givea guarantee of solvency. All such schemes would, therefore, require amendment,in these respects, if the employer decided to contract-out. Presumably the solvencyreferred to here is in respect of the equivalent benefits (some schemes, of course,provide pensions up to  2,000 or even  5,000 per annum) but we find it difficult tovisualise how it is going to be possible to show that part of a self-administered fund is solvent. It would involve determining what part of the contribution wasapplicable to these equivalent benefits and also what part of the existing fund was so applicable. These matters are, no doubt, possible from an actuarial point ofview (although a good many arbitrary decisions might be involved) but unless thereis some legal division of the fund, the contributions and the benefits, how can apart be said, in the strict sense, to be solvent or insolvent? Possibly the equivalentbenefits might be given priority in a winding-up.(c) Preservation of pension rightsSome arrangements for the preservation of pension rights are, of course, essential if contracting-out is to be effective. We feel that a system on the lines suggestedcould be worked out. The wording of paragraph 6 (end of second sentence) seemsto equate preservation to transferability. If a person who has paid contributions to the State on salary in excess of  10 joins a firm which has contracted-out, is it proposed that the State should pay or credit a transfer value?In paragraph 4 you suggest a period of two years to adapt schemes. It maywell be that a longer period would be required in view of the actuarial and legalwork involved and we suggest that there should be power to extend this period ifnecessary.
ANNEX BIf it is decided that graduated contributions and benefits are inevitable thensomething on the lines of Annex B would be simpler to operate than Annex A, butwe would prefer to see no reduction from the present rate of contribution, the Statesubsidy being granted up to the same level as in Annex A and the benefit availablebeing based on the money purchase principle related to the contributions by the employer and employee. We have made no attempt to go into the figures givenin Annex B as presumably there would be another opportunity to do that oncegeneral principles have been decided upon. We would, however, draw attentionto the fact that 81- per cent, of  8 is 13s. 8d., i.e., a good deal less than the 17s. 6d.which is the present contribution for an adult male. 84- per cent, of  10 is in factonly 17s. It would appear that the self-employed contribution would be collectedwith income tax because the amount could not be known until that tax was assessed.Turning now to the specific questions you have raised in paragraph 4 of yourmemorandum:  (i) Few employers would welcome the element of supervision or control asthe case may be and we are very doubtful whether many employers would take the responsibility. Nevertheless we believe that some employers, having regard to the interest rates they could earn in theirfunds, would desire to contract-out, but in our view most of themmight well prefer to let their employees enter the State scheme to thefull extent and use any other moneys available to augment the benefitsprivately where appropriate.(ii) A substantial number of modern schemes base the pensions and contributions on a formula, such as salary less  5 per week, or some modification of this general idea. In those cases the adaptation wouldbe a simple one. In other cases it should be possible to adjust thebenefits appropriately, provided always there were power to do so.Both in contributory and non-contributory schemes the contributionscould be actuarially adjusted to fit in with the revised benefits and ifthe amendments gave rise to a surplus in the existing fund a temporaryadjustment might also be involved.(iii) A pension scheme provides benefits for the employees, and the employergets no direct monetary benefit; it would, therefore, seem desirable thatthe employees should be brought into full consultation before any decision concerning contracting-out is taken. However, a decision notto contract-out should be entirely in the hands of the employer. In thecase of amendments to adapt the scheme to integrate with the fullState scheme, consultation would also seem to us desirable; there may,however, be a less urgent case where there is a non-contributory scheme.In considering amendments arising because of a desire to contract-outwe should regard full consultation as desirable for both contributoryand non-contributory schemes.Thus we reach the conclusion, that on the whole the ideas of Annex A maybe preferable, but possibly excluding contracting-out. The money purchaseprinciple for contributions and benefits on salary or wages over  10 appears to usmore suitable because no State subsidy is proposed at that level and under it aperson gets value for money (his and his employers).
Appendix vi the TRADE UNION  COUNCIL(Mr. C. R. Dale, Secretary of the Social Insurance Committee)Copy of Letter to the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceYou may find it convenient to have this record of the main points we put toin discussion this morning:  1. If a national scheme of wage-related superannuation were to be introducedit should be additional to, not in substitution for, a flat-rate national insurance pension.2. An immediate and substantial increase in National Insurance pensionswas urgently needed, and every effort should be made to increase and maintain the pension at the amount needed for adequate subsistence.3. (a) Contributions for the National Insurance pension should not exceed the amount actuarially needed to provide pension for thoseentering insurance at 16 years. The Exchequer supplement tocontributions should be restored to its pre-1951 proportion.(b) Contributions for the wage-related element should not be an unreasonable burden on the insured contributor.4.
