As you know, the difficulties which the cotton industry is facingin Lancashire are very much in our minds.    V/e have given muchthought to the question of what we, as the Government which isultimately responsible for the well-being of Hong Kong, can properlysay to the Government and industry there about what the next step should be following upon the understanding which the United kingdom industry has now reached with the Indian and Pakistan industries.2.      This is a very serious matter for Hong Kong.     We have torecognise that Hong Kong must expand its exports of manufactured goodsif it is to be able to sustain any acceptable standard of life for itsgrowing population, swollen by a great influx of refugees from China.It is only natural that Hong Kong should expect the United Kingdom,whose ward she is, to admit Hong Kong goods freely to the markethere (especially as she admits United Kingdom goods free of tariffor quota).    Moreover, in the case of cotton textiles there are, as youwill recognise, particular difficulties.    Not only is the Hong Kongindustry already facing difficulties in some of its markets outsidethe United Kingdom (e.g., in Indonesia), but it is threatened withrestrictive action in others (e.g. , the United States of America).Moreover, the proposal now is that the Hong Kong industry ought to-1-
be prepared to agree to a voluntary limitation over the whole range ofits cotton textile products - i. e., covering &quot;made-ups&quot; as well as piecegoods - whereas hitherto the industry has stated firmly that it willnot contemplate an agreement going beyond the basis indicated toSir Frank Lee - i. e. , one covering grey cloth only (plus possiblybleached cloth).    Finally, there is the problem arising from theinsistence of the Indian industry that the basis of negotiation for aHong Kong ceiling should be the figure of exports in 1957, whereasHong Kong exports so far in 1958 have been running at about 25 per cent above that figure.3.     These are formidable difficulties.    Nevertheless the Govern-ment have reached the conclusion that the advantages both to theindustry here and to those in the other countries concerned of an agreed inter-industry understanding for a period of three years, reached on a voluntary basis, are likely to be so significant that they areprepared to tell the Hong Kong industry, through the Governor, thatin their judgment the industry would be well advised to show itselfprepared to negotiate an agreement with Lancashire covering &quot;made-ups&quot;.Otherwise, as you have pointed out, there would be the risk that theagreement reached with the Indian and Pakistan industries would falland that the whole concept of a voluntary inter-industry settlement would be lost.4.      In the last analysis this must be a matter on which the hong Kong industry must make its own decision, and we adhere to theprinciple that any arrangement must be a voluntary one.    For thereasons which I have indicated it will not be easy for them to accept theidea of an understanding covering made-up goods.    And there willremain the difficulty arising from the insistence of the Indian industry on the 1957 import figure being taken as a basis for the Hong Kongceiling.    There will, I feel, have to be some compromise on this point,even if it means some difficult further discussions with the Indianindustry.5.      The Government is prepared to take the action which I have indicated in the belief that, while the United Kingdom cotton textile industry must be prepared to make drastic adjustments, painful though these will be both in financial and human terms, because of the largeexporting power now developing in the Commonwealth (and not least in hong Kong), it is desirable that these changes should take place in an orderly manner and in a way which would remove the danger of violent reaction.    In short, it is essential that the United kingdom industry should realise that what the Government envisages is not astate of perpetual protection against Commonwealth industries but theopportunity of securing orderly change over a period.9TH JULY, 1958
