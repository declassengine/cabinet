Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1958C. (58) 141 Copy No.7th July, 1958CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the 40th Session of the International Labour Conference in June 1957, adoptedthree Conventions and two Recommendations. One of the Conventions, No. 105,concerning the abolition of forced labour has already been ratified by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in accordance with the Cabinets decision of 6th November, 1957(C.C. (57) 78th Conclusions, Minute 10). This memorandum discusses the action proposed on the other Conventions and Recommendations adopted by theConference, viz.:  Convention No. 106 and Recommendation No. 103 concerning weekly rest incommerce and offices;Convention No. 107 and Recommendation No. 104 concerning the protection and integration of indigenous and other tribal and semi-tribal populationsin independent countries.2. The texts of these Conventions and Recommendations were presented to Parliament in December last with the report by the Government delegates tothe Conference (Cmnd. 328). Annexed is a summary of their contents and thereasons for the decisions proposed on them which are as follows:  (1) the Convention on weekly rest in commerce and offices should not be ratified, because it would impose on the Government an unnecessaryobligation to legislate or take other action to ensure entitlement to a weekly rest period already well established by custom, and that the supplementary Recommendation (No. 103) should not be accepted;(2) the Convention on the protection and integration of indigenous and othertribal and semi-tribal populations in independent countries should notbe ratified because it has no application to the United Kingdom andthat the supplementary Recommendation (No. 104) should not beaccepted.3. Conventions and Recommendations of the International LabourOrganisation are ratified or accepted on behalf of both Great Britain and NorthernIreland. The Minister of Labour of Northern Ireland has been consulted andconcurs with the present proposals.4. It is the practice to inform Parliament by means of a White Paper ofthe Governments proposals on Conventions and Recommendations adopted bythe International Labour Conference. If these proposals are approved, authority is sought for the issue of a White Paper which would state briefly the action proposed and the reasons for it.I. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,4th July, 1958.53602
2CONFIDENTIALANNEXConvention (No. 106) and Recommendation (No. 103) concerning Weekly Restin Commerce and Offices1. The Convention provides that all persons employed in commerce and offices to whom its provisions apply shall be entitled to an uninterrupted weeklyrest period of not less than 24 hours, to be granted wherever possible simultaneously to all the persons concerned in each establishment. Provision is made for temporary exemptions in certain circumstances, subject to appropriatecompensatory time off work. The provisions of the Convention, in so faras they are not otherwise made effective by statutory wage-fixing machinery,collective agreements, arbitration awards, or other means appropriate to nationalconditions, have to be given effect by national laws or regulations, and appropriate measures have to be taken for enforcing the provisions.2. The Recommendation supplements the Convention. It provides that thepersons to whom the Convention applies should, as far as possible, be entitled toa weekly rest of not less than 36 hours; deals with the detailed calculation and application of the rest periods provided for under the Convention; and providesfor longer rest periods to be given wherever practicable to young persons.3. In the United Kingdom workers within the scope of the Conventiongenerally enjoy a weekly rest period which is at least equal to and in most cases is more liberal than that specified in the Convention. There is no legislativecontrol, however, except in the case of those workers in shops where the ShopsAct, 1950, and the corresponding legislation in Northern Ireland apply and alsoin the case of women and young persons in industry who may not, with certain exceptions, be employed on Sundays. As far as is known, there is little or no formal entitlement to the rest periods under voluntary arrangements. Rest periods,generally speaking, are adequately secured by custom which is widely recognised and supported by the fixing of enhanced rates of pay for overtime and week-endwork in voluntary collective agreements and statutory wage regulation orders.4. In these circumstances ratification of the Convention would involve legislation granting entitlement to the specified period of rest at least to thoseworkers not at present formally entitled to it, and an obligation to ensure that theconditions of those already in formal entitlement were, and continued to be, in fullcompliance with the Convention.But unless there are compelling reasons for doing otherwise, it is not thepractice in this country for the Government to intervene in matters which arethe concern of both sides of industry to determine. In view of the generally satisfactory situation already described there would be no sufficient justification for such intervention by the Government.5. It is proposed, therefore, that the United Kingdom should not ratify theConvention, or accept the supplementary Recommendation.Convention (No. 107) and Recommendation (No. 104) concerning the protection and Integration of Indigenous and other Tribal and Semi-Tribal Populationsin Independent Countries6. The Convention, which was drawn up with the co-operation of the united nations and the other specialised agencies concerned, provides internationalstandards for the protection and integration of indigenous and other tribal and semi-tribal populations in independent countries. It lays on Governments the primary responsibility for developing co-ordinated and systematic action for theprotection of the populations concerned and their progressive integration into the life of their respective communities. The Recommendation supplements, in moreparticular terms, the general provisions of the Convention.7. The United Kingdom, in which there are no populations of this kind, isnot directly affected by either of the two Instruments and, as they refer specifically to independent countries, they are not applicable to the non-metropolitan territoriesfor which the United Kingdom is responsible.8. It is, therefore, proposed that the United Kingdom should not ratify thisConvention nor accept the Recommendation.
