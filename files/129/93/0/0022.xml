THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTWAGES POLICY: COMPULSORY ARBITRATION AND THE industrial disputes order memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service at the invitation of the Committee on Wages Policy (W.P. (58) 1st Meeting,Item 2) I am setting out the considerations on which I think we should base adecision to abandon Defence Regulation 58aa, and with it the Industrial DisputesOrder, at the end of this year. This raises a question of considerable importance for the future of industrial relations in Britain, namely, whether in presentcircumstances any part can be usefully played by compulsory arbitration in settlingindustrial disputes. A short note on the Industrial Disputes Order and on theoperation of compulsory arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Tribunal is appended.2. My Department have sounded the British Employers&apos; Confederation(B.E.C.), the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.), the Nationalised Industries, and thelocal authority associations on the subject in a series of informal discussions since february 1957.   Two things have been made clear to them throughout:  (a) that Defence Regulation 58aa (and with it the Industrial Disputes Order)must go but that Ministers are under no commitment to replace it, orany part of it, in permanent legislation;(b) that whatever happens to the Order, the existing facilities for voluntaryarbitration, and for inquiry and investigation, provided by the industrial courts Act, 1919, and the Conciliation Act, 1896, will remain entirelyundisturbed.3. Throughout these discussions, the B.E.C. have declared themselves firmlyopposed to permanent legislation embodying compulsory arbitration on the presentlines. They contend that the present arrangements have become a source of friction and frustration in industrial relations, and tend to operate unfairly againstemployers. On the other hand, the T.U.C. are in favour of continuing the presentsystem with the least change and public debate possible. They point to the benefits in terms of the reduction of working hours lost through strikes which, they say, have resulted over the last eighteen years.4. There is, therefore, a state of disagreement between the B.E.C. and T.U.C.with little hope of compromise. Over a limited area, however, there is sufficientagreement to make it probable that all interested parties would support the continuation of that part of the existing Order which relates to what are known as&quot; issues &quot; (see paragraph 3 of the Appendix). This relates to the question whetherwage rates, &amp;c, not less favourable than those negotiated by the establishedmachinery of the industry concerned should be enforced upon a particular employer.(Organised employers, no less than trade unions, disapprove of employers outsidethe organisation being allowed to undercut negotiated rates.)5. When the Order was introduced in 1951, the Socialist Administration made it clear that it was to be experimental and had been accepted by the two sides ofindustry on the firm understanding that if at any time either of them wished it toPrinted for the Cabinet.

be discontinued it would be reviewed immediately. This has been construed to mean further that the Order would be withdrawn if, after review, either siderequested it. It would be very difficult, in my view, to argue that, since the initiativefor review has in fact come from the Government, this undertaking has no bearing.6. The Nationalised Industries have expressed no strong view on the futureof the Order but appear to be content that some form of compulsory arbitrationshould continue to be available. They have not, in any case, made much use of it;for the most part they have agreed voluntary arbitration arrangements of their own.On the other hand, the Tribunal is much used for settling disputes in localgovernment, especially in the higher income ranges. The Local authority associations wish to retain the Order, mainly as a means of keeping their members in line, and the National Association of Local Government Officers are naturallyof the same view. There will, then, be discontent in local government circlesif we abandon the Order, but as we had it in mind to impose a top salary limit if weretained the Order in permanent form, there would have been discontent anywayat the exclusion of the higher income ranges. The Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment does not wish to press for the retention of the Order for local authoritypurposes. No consultations have been held with the professional organisationswho were, by inadvertence, excluded from the scope of compulsory arbitration in1951 when the wartime Order (Statutory Instrument No. 1305) was replaced by theexisting Order. This is a grievance which has in the past given rise to considerableParliamentary criticism of the Government, and came before the Cabinet inOctober 1952 (C.C. (52) 90th Conclusions, Minute 7). There is, however, no pointin consulting them unless compulsory arbitration is to be continued in some formin permanent legislation.Conclusions7. In these circumstances, the Wages Policy Committee are in generalagreement about what our attitude should be when the time comes, as it must fairlysoon, for us to declare our intentions about the future of compulsory arbitration.We are clear that industrial arbitration can operate only against a generalbackground of agreement on both sides of industry to accept it and the form whichit takes. If we are to have permanent legislation about this matter, therefore, itshould not extend beyond the area of agreement between the two sides and that area of agreement, the question of &quot; issues &quot; referred to in paragraph 4 above, is too small to have a significant effect on industrial relations; only about 20 or 30&quot; issues &quot; are referred to the Tribunal each year, and these are matters of smallimportance in the wider setting of industrial relations as a whole. The effect ofthe &quot; issues &quot; procedure is, in fact, to put a lever in the hands of the unions, withthe collaboration or assent of organised employers, against employers who for reasons of their own choose to remain outside employers&apos; organisations. Suchmatters are probably better left to the regulation of industry itself without the intervention of this form of legal compulsion.8. Apart from the fact that the two sides of industry disagree sharply aboutthe continuation of the main provisions of the Order, there are, on merits, not manycases in which resort to compulsory arbitration can be regarded as reasonable,given the system of free collective bargaining which we have in this country. Anygap that might be left in the machinery of industrial relations by the disappearance of the Order would probably only be temporary since it has for some time been felt that the existence of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal has tended to attractdisputes which could and would (but for the existence of the Tribunal) have cometo the Industrial Court and been settled there on a voluntary basis. It would be wise to do what we can to encourage this development, which would also apply inthe local authority field.9. On this showing, then, our best course would be to drop defence regulation 58aa and the Industrial Disputes Order, without replacement of any kind, at the next annual review of the Defence Regulations. To resist any opposition there might be, on political as well as on industrial lines, we would haveto rely principally on two lines of argument:  (a) the doubt whether there is any permanent place for compulsory arbitration in our system of free collective bargaining;(b) the need for basing any system of industrial arbitration on the broadassent of unions and employers&apos; organisations alike.
10. I propose therefore that we should abandon compulsory arbitration underthe Order with effect from 10th December, 1958, when the Defence Regulationwould fall to be renewed, and that I should announce this intention probably inthe autumn after the meeting in September of the Trades Union Congress.I. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,12th June, 1958.appendix the INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ORDER, 1951, AND THE OPERATION of compulsory ARBITRATION UNDER THE industrial disputes TRIBUNALThe history of the existing system of compulsory arbitration in Britain is thatStatutory Rule and Order No. 1305, introduced under Defence Regulation 58aa in1940, prohibited strikes and lockouts and at the same time set up an independent tribunal (the National Arbitration Tribunal) to which either party to an industrial dispute could seek access, without the consent of the other, for the adjudication ofdisputed claims regarding, principally, terms and conditions of labour. After thewar it was judged, with the concurrence of both sides of industry, that the urgent need to maintain production made the continuation of the compulsory systemessential but that the penal provisions against strikes and lockouts which had proved unworkable should be dropped. A new Industrial Disputes Order(Statutory Instrument No. 1376) was introduced on these lines in August 1951 inthe closing days of the Socialist Administration. This is the Order which constitutes the present Industrial Disputes Tribunal, and it was made on the understandingthat if at any time either side of industry wished it to be discontinued, it would be reviewed immediately. This has been construed to mean further that the order would be withdrawn if either side requested it.2. The Industrial Disputes Tribunals jurisdiction is limited to contestedclaims connected with &quot; terms of employment or conditions of labour &quot; in effect,remuneration. The compulsive elements of the Order are twofold: first, an obligation to submit to the Tribunals adjudication at the behest of a dissatisfiedclaimant and, second, an obligation, on pain of enforcement by the civil courts, to implement the terms of the Tribunals award.3. The Order contemplates that contested claims may be of two types. Thefirst type is described as a &quot; dispute &quot; which is generally about a straight claim forincreased wage-rates; the second type is described as an &quot; issue &quot; or, in other words,a question whether terms and conditions not less favourable than those negotiated by the established machinery of the industry concerned should be enforced upona particular employer.4. The Tribunal is appointed from panels of independent members chosen bythe Minister of Labour, and of members chosen in consultation with the B.E.C. andT.U.C. to represent employers and workpeople respectively. The result is that the tribunals decisions may be influenced by people who themselves are still active inthe wage-negotiating field, though not, by custom and practice, in the industry withwhich the particular claim which they are called upon to hear is concerned.5. The Industrial Disputes Tribunal in recent years has awarded on anaverage of about 116 disputes and 26 &quot; issues &quot; annually. The great majority ofthese cases have, at face value, been of very small national significance but majordisputes with a crucial bearing on the course of wage claims and wage movementscan, and occasionally do, come before the Tribunal. It has, throughout, beenexceptional for an employer to take the initiative in invoking the Tribunal for thesettlement of a dispute.
