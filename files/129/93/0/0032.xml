COMMONWEALTH immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and -Lord Privy seal in his memorandum of 20th June (C.(58) 129) the Lord Presidenthas reported the result of the consideration given by the Committee on commonwealth Immigration and has submitted certain questions for decision by the Cabinet.    It may be helpful to my colleagues in consider-ing these questions if I indicate briefly what my present attitude to them is.2.      I hope that the administrative measures that are being taken will reduce the flow of immigrants from India, Pakistan . and the West indies and that legislative action v/ill not therefore be necessary.    Legislationdirected against the Commonwealth would be controversial in itself.It would be used against us by those who are anxious to prove that theCommonwealth is no longer a unity.    And it would force us to considerthe question of permanent legislation about aliens which would be no less difficult and contentious.    I agree, of course, that the position must be kept under very close review and that we should examine it again in the autumn.3.     If legislation does eventually become necessary, my present view is that it would have to apply to the whole of the Commonwealth and theRepublic of Ireland, even though we used it initially only to deal withimmigration from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.    To discriminate against these countries in the Bill would obviously be difficult.Secondly, to leave the Republic of Ireland outside the scope of the bill and to bring the whole Commonwealth within it would invite attack.Thirdly, even though the problem is at present confined to India,Pakistan and the West Indies it could crop up elsewhere and we wouldnot wish to be faced with the prospect of fresh legislation if it did.4.     As regards permanent legislation about aliens I do not dissent from the proposal that the possibility of a Bill dealing with aliens aswell as with Commonwealth immigration should be studied.    I hope,however, that my colleagues will understand the difficulties of such an operation.    For forty years aliens control has been exercised under anOrder made in the exercise of enabling powers given by a temporaryAct which has been continued from year to year by the Expiring LawsAct.    The Act of 1919 is in general terms: the actual powers of control are contained in a Statutory Instrument.    If our present aliens policyis to be maintained we must have the present powers, including the-1-C.(58) 132 COPY NO.25th June, 1958CABINET
general power to deport or exclude an alien where the Home Secretary-considers this to be in the public interest, and it would be necessary to embody such powers in the Statute and not in subordinate legislation.Any attempt to incorporate such permanent powers in a Bill whichauthorised the exclusion of British subjects in carefully definedcircumstances would strengthen the hands of those who want to make ourpowers to deal with aliens much more precise and circumscribed andsubject to much more closely defined safeguards.    I fear that bittercontroversy would result and that we might at the end of the day findour position considerably weakened.R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.I.24th June, 1958.-2-
