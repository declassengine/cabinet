I SECRET -        269(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRC PERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)..........7&quot;COPY NO. ^ rCAB NETOVERSEA INFORMATION SFRVTCES;  expenditure memorandum b yCv.- C::--. r.ic.? i I 0:1 oc* i-Le Duchy of lancaster the Cabinet approved last year a substantial expansion of the oversea information services and authority was given for expenditure of 15 millions a year (C.C.(57) 48th Conclusions, Minute 2).   The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that, if costs rose, the  15 millions should not be automatically increased in proportion and it was understood that the figureof  15 millions should not be exceeded without further Cabinet authority.2. Substantial progress has been made in recruiting additional staff,opening new information offices and increasing the output of television andother information material.3. Estimated expenditure in 1958/59 is  14. 6 millions and in1959/60  14. 7 millions.   No allowance is made in these estimates for any expenditure due to increases in costs and there is no allowance for contingencies.   The ultimate cost of the oversea services on the scaleapproved in 1957 will rise to about  15. 2 millions.   The Treasury&apos;latest estimates are set out in Appendix A.4. Some costs have risen this year and there is no provision forfurther increases.   In so far as rises in costs occur abroad, they are not under our control and it seems likely that there will be further such increases in 1959/60.   Home costs, including salaries, may well increase after theend of this year.   It does not seem prudent to work on the basis of nofurther increases in costs.5. The Treasury view is that the commitments already accepted will inevitably bring us to the &quot;ceiling&quot; of  15 millions and it is not possible to accommodate any expenditure, however small, on new projects.6. The Foreign Office have now put forward a project for strengtheningour information effort in the Horn of Africa (Somalia and  Ethiopia) byexpanding the British Council&apos;s education work.   This project would cost 41,000 in 1958/59,  109,000 in 1959/60 and  92,000 in 1960/61.   TheForeign Office attach great importance to countering Egyptian/Sovietsubversion into East and Central Africa and regard the situation nowdeveloping in the Horn of Africa as an urgent political problem.   Theimmediate need is to find  22,000 in 1958/59 to cover the cost of meeting a direct request by the Somali Government for four teachers of Englishforthwith.   If suitable men are to be appointed to take up these posts inSeptember, 1958, a decision to authorise the expenditure is requiredurgently.-1-C.(58) 1398th July, 1958
7. This urgent problem and the action required to deal with it are described fully in Appendix B.   The Ministerial Committee on the oversea information Services have discussed the problem and strong support was expressed for the proposed expenditure.   The Financial Secretary emphasisthat there was no room for this project within the existing ceiling and theCommittee invited me to bring the matter before the Cabinet.8. We have emphasised the importance of flexibility in our oversea information effort:-&quot;While  stability and continuity of effort are essential, our effort must be able to react swiftly to a changing situation witha flexibility which permits, as the need may arise, a switch of emphasis from one area to another. 11  (Cmnd. 225, paragraph 4)We must expect new needs to arise suddenly in this uneasy world and theHorn of Africa problem is unlikely to be the only new and urgent claim onour resources this year.   Rising costs inevitably make it more difficult forus to switch our information effort without making such large reductions in the existing level of services as to destroy continuity of effort in important areas.9. In the past, our information effort inevitably suffered seriouslyfrom the frequent cuts in expenditure and stopping work already under wayoften proves wasteful in the end.   It does not seem wise, therefore, toconsider stopping work now on any of the new projects approved last year after searching examination of their merits.10. In order to give my colleagues some idea of the possible field of reductions in existing work not of the first priority, if the Horn of Africaproject had to be accommodated within the existing ceiling, officials havemade a rapid review and I attach their report - Appendix C.   I should emphasise that these are simply some illustrations of work which might bereduced; they are not agreed recommendations of cuts to be made shouldthe Cabinet decide that the Horn of Africa project must go forward withinthe existing ceiling.   There has not been any consultation with the B.B.C.or the British Council and it is important to avoid undermining relationswith them by presenting them with a fait accompli.11. Reductions such as those mentioned in Appendix C could not besaid to damage the basic character of our information effort overseas, butthey would constitute a serious weakening of that effort in some very important areas and we have publicly stated that the existing programme&quot;is necessary to maintain Britain&apos;s Information Services at a levelconsistent with our world-wide responsibility&quot;.   (Cmnd. 225, paragraph 32)12. The increase in expenditure approved last year was substantial and I recognise the importance of keeping within the  15 millions ceiling.Had costs remained steady, and seemed likely to continue so, I would havebeen reluctant now to re-open the question of ceiling expenditure in spite ofthe importance of providing for this new project in Africa.   I cannot, howeverecommend reduction of our existing effort in order to accommodate this orany similar new project.CH.Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,S.W.1.7th July, 1958

THE HORN OF africa note by the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign AffairsAn urgent political problem has arisen in the Horn of Africawhere   anti-Western sentiment is being successfully fomented and must be countered if a situation of real danger is not to arise^  Our strategic interests there are to retain our staging and overflying facilities and inparticular to prevent the spread of Egyptian/Soviet subversion into Eastand Central Africa.   To counter the threat to our interests, action is needed both in the political and economic field and in the sphere ofinformation and culture.   This paper is concerned only v/ith the latteraspect.2. Somalia is a target for Egyptian and Soviet propaganda designedto draw her away from the West into a position of political neutralismor worse when independence is granted in 1960.   The Russians alreadypropose to establish an information centre in Mogadishu and to distributefilms.   Since last summer Egyptian anti-Colonialist propaganda andagitation has been sharply intensified.   It has an obvious appeal to certainclasses of Somalis, who are the more receptive because the Egyptiansare so near and because they have a religion in common.3. Egyptian interest in Somalia at present finds its clearestexpression in the educational field.   There is an Egyptian Cultural centre at Mogadishu.! and there are six schools controlled from Cairo and staffedby Egyptian teachers.   About 180 students from Somalia are at presentstudying in Cairo, many of them on scholarships provided by the egyptian authorities.   One of the main baits used by the Egyptians in Somalia is toteach English.4. Hitherto our information work has been slight and the british council&apos;s work limited to two bursaries though the post of information officer in Mogadishu has now been created and will shortly be filled.   Much moremust be done if we are not to fail to meet the great demand for english language instruction.   Instruction in the State schools is in Italian, theKoranic schools being taught in Arabic.   Only the Egyptian schools giveinstruction in English which in part explains their popularity.5. There are urgent political reasons for strengthening british council work in the neighbouring country of Ethiopia at the same time.   Atpresent the Council subsidise two British-type schools in Ethiopia at a totalcost of  15,500 per annum, but have no representation there: this was with-drawn for reasons of economy several years ago. H.M. Ambassador inAddis Ababa reports that no single act of Her Majesty&apos;s Government sincethe war has done more harm to Anglo-Ethiopian relations than this withdrawalThe Emperor and successive British Ambassadors have long been pressing for the re-opening of the British Council centre.   If the Council were to start operations in Somalia without intensifying their present small?scaleactivities in Ethiopia, this would give serious offence at a time when it isparticularly important to maintain and indeed strengthen British influencethere.   Furthermore, English occupies a special position in Ethiopia.-4-
After the Emperor&apos;s return in 1941, it became the second official language of the country.   All instruction in Ethiopian schools from Grade 5 toGrade 12, except religion and Amharic, is conducted in English.   a friendly Ethiopia is just as important to us as a friendly Somalia as an obstacle to Egyptian and possibly Soviet penetration in the Horn of Africa.6. The Somalis and Ethiopians have a passionate desire for education, and an extension of British Council activities in Somalia and ethiopia is therefore the most pressing need.   Further intensification ofinformation work will however probably also be necessary to reinforce the cultural effort.7. For this essential expansion of educational work in the Horn of africa the British Council have as a first step produced the following plans:-(a) Somalia(i)       An immediate need is to meet an urgent request which we havereceived from the Somali Government for four teachers of English forthwith.Arrangements are in hand to recruit men for September, 1958, subject to financial authority.   The supply of these teachers is of urgent importance as a political gesture as well as intrinsically.(ii)       Thereafter a centre should be established in Mogadishu:  fouradditional teachers should be appointed and scholarships, books, periodicalsand films provided.(b) EthiopiaAt present the British Council only subsidise two schools in ethiopia at a total cost of  15,500 per annum.   In addition the Council need a representative in the country and a general intensification of their workthere.8. No money is, however, available for these purposes.   A detailedestimate of the cost cannot be made until a survey on the spot has beencarried out.   A tentative estimate is as follows(a)(i)      21,900 in 1958/59K 12,000 in 1959/60 12,000 in 1960/61 15,000 in 1961/62Note;  This includes heavy initial costs on furniture, air-conditioning equipment, etc.(a)(ii)  300 in 1958/59 (for a survey) 66,900 in 1959/60 53,000 in 1960/61 53,000 in 1961/62-5-
j :.......:v(b)  18,500 in 1958/59 29,700 in 1959/60 26,800 in 1960/61 26,800 in 1961/62Grand        40,700 in 1958/59Total        108,600 in 1959/60 91,800 in 1960/61 94,800 in 1961/62.9. This problem has come to the fore since the Cabinet paper c.(57) 141 and therefore no account of it was taken then.   The financial problem which it raises is stated as follows in a communication-from theTreasury to the Foreign Office:-&quot;As a matter of finance, the position is that the Cabinet, when they approved the expanded oversea information services programme, implied that Cabinet authority would be required for any expenditure which exceededa figure of  15 millions a year, when all the priority proposals then putforward had taken full effect.&quot;The 1958/59 Vote provision for oversea information work totals 14,577,000 and we calculate that rather more than this will be required toput into full effect the projects included in the 1958/59 Estimates.   allowance should also be made, presumably, for eventual full British Council activity in Egypt, Syria and Greece, which would cost at least an additional  100,000a year.   Then there are rising costs (in large measure not under orcr controlbecause they occur abroad) and other contingencies.   Our general conclusion is that we are for all practical purposes already at the ceiling of 15 millions,&quot;In our view, your proposals in respect of Somalia could be putinto force only if some compensating savings were made elsewhere.   this need not, of course, involve any change of policy regarding Category Iprojects approved last year.   There is the great body of information workwhich has continued from previous years, some of which may well be of lower priority than the work you now propose in Somalia and Ethiopia. &quot;10. There is unfortunately no solution to be found along the lines of theTreasury suggestion in the last paragraph of the foregoing quotation. - TheCommittee on Oversea Information Services reviewed the existing work in1957 and the only field where Her Majesty&apos;s Government, after reviewingits Report, directed that economies should be found was Western Europewith particular reference to Germany.   The economies asked for have already-been arranged and are accounted for in the financial picture traced in thefirst two paragraphs of the Treasury&apos;s communication.   The Foreign Officecannot contemplate a weakening of the existing information machinery in other areas or agencies to the extent necessary to meet this requirement.   OtherOversea Departments were consulted at the Official Committee on oversea information Services on 28th April and recorded a similar opinion.   Theonly possible major field for economies might be further pruning of theB0B,Ce, but it is extremely debatable whether this is in fact advisable andit would be politically difficult to sustain.-6-
11. Tn sum, the authority is needed for raising the informationceiling by making additional provision for British Council activities asfollows :- 40,700 in 1958/59 - of which  21,900, for expenditure beginning with immediate effect, is for the urgentrequirement of the four teachers referredto in paragraph 7(a) above. 108,600 in 1959/60 91,800 in 1960/61 94,800 in 1961/62.I.D.H.APPENDIX CPOSSIBLE FIELD IF REDUCTIONS IN existing in NGN-PRIORITY I WORKReport by OfficialsWe have made a rapid review of the possible field of reductionsamounting to about  100,000 a year in the work of the oversea information services.   The reductions set out below are put forward as illustrationsof ways in which information work might be reduced and they are not agreedrecommendations for cutting down existing services.   We have not consultedeither the British Broadcasting Corporation or the British Council.2. In the time available, and in the absence of consultation with theB.B.C., it has not been possible to estimate closely the likely reductions in expenditure from the curtailment or elimination of particular activities.It will be seen that the total sum involved in the reductions which are described in this Report amounts to  140,000;   some of the illustrations areincluded as alternative ways of securing reductions amounting in all to 100,000.3. Summary of illustrations of possible reductions in oversea information services  (a year)B.B.C.External Services(see paragraph 4) .    80,000Foreign Office 25,000(see paragraph 5) 50,000 N. American 20,000 Thai and Burmese 10,000 German and Italian 17,000 Russian magazine 5,000 Communications 3,000 Information materialCommonwealth relations office (see paragraph 6)Colonial Office(see paragraph 7)30,0005,000140,000 20,000 Films 10,000 New Zealand 4,000 Reuters 1,000 Information material
4. B.B.C. External services.   These services account for about40 per cent of the total expenditure on oversea information and it is reasonable to look to this sector for the larger part of any necessaryreduction in total expenditure.   To make a large nhmber of relatively small reductions throughout the range of the B.B.C.&apos;s external services would almost certainly result in a serious deterioration in the morale and efficiency of the whole of them out of all proportion to the savings achieved.It would seem wiser to look for reductions by way of eliminating one or more of the individual services, even though such a step would necessarily involved an immediate political impact on the countries served and it wouldbe very difficult to restore such services.Possible reductions:-(i) Virtual elimination of the North American service: a saving of the order of  50,000 a year.(ii)    Elimination of the Thai and Burmese services: a saving of the order of  20,000 a year.(iii)    Further reductions in the Italian and German services;a saving of the order of  10,000 a year.It would be essential to discuss these and any other possiblereductions with the B.B.C. on the basis of a comprehensive examination ofthe external services as a whole.   It is impossible to give more precisefitures without consultation with the Corporation.5. Foreign Office.    The following are illustrations of possiblereductions in the field of Foreign Office expenditure (some of the savings would be in Central Office of Information and Stationery Office Votes).(i)  Indefinite suspension of the project to produce a Russianmagazine:  a saving of the order of  17,000 a year.   TheForeign Office will, however, feel bound to continue to press this project on the Russians as opportunity offers.(ii) Deferring improvement of communications equipment forcertain Foreign Office posts: a saving of the order of  5,000a year.(iii) A sizeable and painful reduction in the supply of newspapers,periodicals and other material provided by the Central Officeof Information on behalf of the Foreign Office:  a saving of theorder of  3,000 a year.6. Commonwealth Relations Office.    The Commonwealth relations office concur in the suggested abolition of the North American service of.B.C. which covers Canada as well as the U.S.A.The modest establishment of United Kingdom based officers in commonwealth Relations Office information posts in Commonwealth capital and provincial cities precludes any reductions in existing expenditure on them without the most serious damage to their work.   To try to securesavings of the order of  30,000 a year by making small reductions in staff at a number of these posts, which would then revert to one man posts with
all the attendant disadvantages, does not seem a wise course to follow so soon after the announcement in July, 1957, of the expansion programme.   if ministers decided that a reduction must be made by the commonwealth relations Office, it would be wiser to maintain the efficiency of this workover the widest possible area and, therefore, to concentrate the reductions on one Commonwealth country.   However ill-timed such a decision mightbe at present it could be argued that the results might possibly be lessunfortunate in New Zealand than elsewhere.(i) Abolition of Commonwealth Relations Office information work in New Zealand: a saving of about  10,000 a year.Similarly, the needs of old and new posts under the expansion programme forinformation material - newspapers, magazines, booklets, films - are soheavy that it seems wiser to concentrate reductions on one of these media.To give up the use of films (other than television films) in commonwealth countries would be particularly damaging in the newermember countries where so many people are illiterate or only semi-literateand also in work in schools throughout the Commonwealth.   reciprocal arrangements with other Commonwealth countries for distribution of filmsfor schools secure a wide showing for our films at little or no cost to us and once broken it would be impossible to restore them.   Moreover, the costs of production by the Central Office of Information for the ForeignOffice and Colonial Office would rise substantially if the commonwealth relations Office had to give up the use of films.   But their abolition would produce the balance of a sum of  30,000 if the Commonwealth relations office had to make reductions on this scale.(ii) Abolition of the use of films: a saving of the order of 20,000 a year.7. Colonial Office.    There is no scope for significant reductions inthis field without cutting down the Priority I projects approved in July,1957.   The Colonial Office had only two information posts before this expansion was approved (Nigeria and British &quot;West Indies).   Even to reduce expenditure by  5,000 would involve a damaging reduction in the supplyof information material prepared by the Central Office of Information forthe Colonial Office and giving up hope of improving the British news service to the British West Indies by helping Reuters to provide a radio teletypeservice.(i)  Reduction of Central Office of Information/Stationery Officeinformation material: a saving of  1,000 a year.(ii)  Not helping Reuters to set up an improved news service to the British West Indies:  a saving of  4,000 a year.8. British Council.   Although the British Councils work takesalmost 30 per cent of the total expenditure provided for the oversea information services, we have not taken any illustrations of possiblereductions from this field.   The Oversea Departments attach a very high priority to the work of the British Council.   Broadly speaking, its work isof a long term character;   it does not provide operational services in thesame way as the Central Office of Information.   To be effective in any field,
the British Council must work there continuously for a long period.   hence the importance of long term planning and the need to avoid too frequentchanges.   But the Oversea Departments are agreed that in the event of adecision that the present level of expenditure on the information service as a whole must be reduced, and a searching examination made of allpossible economies, British Council expenditure would have to be reviewed.July, 1958
