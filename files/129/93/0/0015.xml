COMMONWEALTH PREFERENCES ON BASIC MATERIALSMemorandum by the Paymaster-general  was asked by the Economic Policy Committee to circulate anote on the effect on Commonwealth preferences of the proposals relating to basic materials in 0.(58) 110.2. The United Kingdom has no significant duties on the main basic materials with the exception of vegetable oils, sisal, leather and hard-wood.3.      Our tariffs on these are:-Most favoured     Preferential Main.&apos; -nation CommonwealthPercentage sourceVegetable oils 10/15 Nil Most exceptAustralia andNew Zealand.Sisal 10 Nil East AfricaLeather 10/15 Nil IndiaHardwood 10 Nil West Africa4.      Our intention is that the negotiation to agree upon low or zerotariffs for basic materials would not involve an obligation on the country with a high tariff to reduce its tariff to the &quot;agreed level&quot; (which wouldin any case have a margin of tolerance either way).   Thus even if the&quot;agreed level&quot; were lower than our most favoured nation level, weshould not be required to reduce our most favoured nation level and soreduce the formal preferential margin.   The position, say, of east african supplies of sisal to the United Kingdom market vis-a-vis thatof Brazilian supplies would be unchanged, so far-.as the sales of the rawmaterial in the United Kingdom market would be concerned.   This wasnot perhaps entirely clear from the report of officials circulated with c.(58) 110.5.      On the other hand, the existence of the Free Trade Area (andthis is quite independent of whether any agreement on the lines nowproposed for basic material is or is not made) subjects the consumersof Commonwealth materials in the United Kingdom to sharper competition-1-C.(58) 115 COPY NO.  5^21st May, 1958CABINET
from Continental production.   It is true to say, therefore, that thePakistani goatskin merchants may not be able to get the higher price that the present margin of preference has been securing for them,because French purses made from North African skins would be coming in duty-free.6.      There will inevitably be pressure from the United Kingdomconsuming industries on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reduce the most favoured nation tariff on basic materials, where any exists, and with itthe preferential margins.   But provided that the Commonwealthsuppliers are prepared to supply at world prices (as they do now inmany cases), using the preference to keep their share of the market,there is no reason to assume that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would haveto give in to this pressure.7.      There is inevitably uncertainty about the outcome in these particular basic materials where a preference exists.   In vegetable oils and hardwood, the &quot;Six&quot; have not yet fixed their common tariff:   in crudelinseed oil, for example, the tariffs of the &quot;Six&quot; vary between  and 22 per cent, whereas the United Kingdom most favoured nation is15 per cent:   in hardwood, they vary from nil to 1 8 per cent andthe United Kingdom&apos;s is 10 per cent.   In sisal, the &quot;Six&quot; have agreedupon a nil tariff, which implies sharper competition in rope and otherSisal products in the United Kingdom.    In leather, the &quot;Six&apos;s&quot; common tariff is to be 10 per cent and the United Kingdom&apos;s 10-15 per cent.8.      There are other cases of less importance.   Major materials with small preferences include zinc, lead and softwood (about Zj per cent,-I per cent and ^per cent respectively).   There are many minor materialswith preferences (mostly 10 per cent), such as casein, tallow and the minor non-ferrous metals.9.      From the point of view of the Commonwealth as a whole, themain interest is in maintaining, and retaining their opportunity to develop,their markets in the Free Trade Area as a whole.   The lower the tariffs on basic materials, the better the prospect of retaining liberalorigin rules, with corresponding advantages for this Commonwealthobjective.R.M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W.1.20th May, 1958S EC RET
