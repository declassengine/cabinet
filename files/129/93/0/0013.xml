C.(58) 113 CGFY NO.19th May, 1958CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT bill memorandum by the Secretary of State.fcr Scotland,the Minister of Housing and Local Governmeritj.nd Ministgrfor Welsh Affairs and the Minister of education on 29th April the Cabinet (C.C.(58) 35th Conclusions, Minute 2)invited us to circulate a memorandum on the implications of moving,in the House of Lords, an amendment to restore the percentage granton capital expenditure by local education authorities.The nature of the proposal2.      The proposals could not be confined to capital expenditure onthe education service:   if the Bill were to be amended, capitalexpenditure on all the relevant services would have to be treated in thesame way.   It would be a matter of retaining a percentage grant forall loan charges which attract it at present, and not merely for thefurther capital expenditure which we want to encourage.   This is adifferent proposal from that put forward by the Association of EducationCommittees:  the amendments urged by them and referred to in theCabinet were more far-reaching - they would have taken all educationright out of the general grant.3.      Capital expenditure would of course have to be defined;   and as time is not available for all the consultations necessary to ensure anadequate definition in relation to all the services involved, power wouldhave to be taken for the appropriate Ministers to make Regulations.Questions to be settled4.      If the change were to be made, an important decision would need to be taken on the rate or rates of grant which should be paid on capitalexpenditure.   The present rates of percentage grant vary widely;  theyrange from 25 per cent (fire service) to 7 5 per cent (advancedtechnological education), with the greater part of the capital expenditure involved receiving 60 per cent by way of education main grant.   Thegrant towards old people&apos;s homes under the National Assistance Actis a unit grant and very small.   Even those who believe in percentagegrants recognise that there is likely to be a lack of proper regard for economy with a rate higher than 50 per cent (though this is lower thanthe current rate on educational expenditure).   On the other hand therehas been pressure from the local authorities for a long time for anincrease in the 25 per cent grant for the fire service, and for an increasein the unit grant for old people&apos;s homes.   V/e should also be under heavy
pressure lor a grant of more than 50 per cent for the development of the mental health services, as recommended by the Royal Commission.   Anew grant would also have to be provided for capital expenditure on welfare services for the handicapped, which are being grant-aidedunder the Bill for the first time.   But a new Financial Resolution inthe Commons would be required if any statutory maximum for an existing grant were to be increased, or new grants made, and with theBill in the Lords this would involve grave procedural difficulties.There has been no precedent since 1868, and when in recent years- therehas been a suggestion of taking a supplementary Resolution after theBill has left the Commons the Public Bill Office have shown themselvesstrongly opposed to the procedure being revived.   In addition to theCommittee and Report Stages for the Financial Resolution, the lords amendments covered by it would probably have to be taken both in committee and in the House.Amendments required5.      The first three clauses of the Bill are drafted on the basis thatfor whole services, or several parts of services; the general grant is toreplace the former grant.   The change proposed would mean that items of expenditure in these services were grant-aided differently accordingto their nature.   It would have to be decided whether, as a matter of presentation, this major change should be brought out plainly on the face of the clauses or should be limited to amendment of the Schedules.Some amendment of the clauses could not in any event be avoided;  and certainly in debate on the clauses the Government would have to disclosetheir intentions.6.      The essential amendments are:-(a) on the clauses or the Schedules, limitation of the general grant to expenditure other than capital expenditure;(b) new provision for definition of capital expenditure;(c) new power to make grants for capital expenditure on welfare services for the handicapped;(d) omission of the paragraphs of the First Schedule whichbring into general grant the planning grants, grants under the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937,and grants for the provision of accoinmodation by localauthorities under the National Assistance Act, 1948;(e) removal of the weighting in the formula for decliningpopulation in Part III of the First Schedule;(f) amendment of the provisions for pooling in Fart iv of the First Schedule;(g) amendments to the Eighth and Ninth Schedules dealing withminor and consequential amendments and repeals.7.      Similar amendments would be required to the Scottish Bill.-2-
Arguments for and against the proposal8.      Arguments in favour of the amendments may be summarisedas follows:-(a) The need for expenditure of a capital nature varies widely fromone area to another.   In education, for example, the replacement of bad school buildings will be a more acute problem in the industrialmidlands and the north than in the home counties, where, because ofthe influx of population and high employment in the 1930&apos;s, a greatdeal of new school building was undertaken between the wars and since.(b) Capital expenditure accounts for only some 10 per cent of localauthorities&apos; expenditure, but it is the starting point of most developments and psychologically so important that grant in respect of it should be ona demonstrably fair basis;   it is not altogether easy, in rsspect of thisparticular expenditure, to have to rely too much on the &quot;swings androundabouts&quot; defence of the working of the general grant.(c) Most important, it cannot be argued that a percentage grant on capital expenditure will lead to extravagance because capital expendituremust in any case be strictly controlled from the centre both in amount(size of programme) and, at any rate in education, in standard (cost perplace);  and, for the same reason, we could not reasonably be accused of restricting the scope for increased local responsibility which theBill as a whole is intended to offer.(d) The adoption of the proposal would be a sign that the Governmentare in earnest in the protestations that they will make proper provisionfor development under the new system of local government finance.And if we decide, as part of our future programme, to undertake measuresof educational advance we need to produce a more favourable climate forthem.9. On the other hand, apart from the procedural difficulties discussed in paragraph 4:-(a)    A change would undermine much of the case which has been advanced during the passage of the Bill in favour of the general grantprinciple.   Government spokesmen have repeatedly said that thedevelopment of services, and especially of education, can be fully safe-guarded under the Bill as it stands.   They have also pointed out that important public health services have been developed without any grant at all.   The Government and the Party have stood and fought for thegeneral grant principle ever since the White Paper was laid nearly ayear ago.   Every attempt by the Opposition to defeat it or to limit its scope has been successfully resisted.   A change now would be a repudiatioof the responsible Ministers.   An Opposition amendment to retain thepossibility of specific grant to aid the development of services was defeated on Report.   Suddenly, and for no apparent reason, to proposea major breach of the principle - and in the House of Lords at that -would confound our supporters and rejoice the Opposition.-3-
(b) It is true that capital expenditure is now closely controlled againstextravagance.   Eut this is a post-war development, and the controldoes not extend to the mode of borrowing, which is left entirely tolocal discretion;  the mode of borrowing may greatly affect the total amount of interest payable, which in its turn will rank for grant.(c) The case in Cabinet was wholly argued with reference to thefuture development.   But the proposal is to provide percentage grants for all loan charges, i. e. in respect of past expenditure as well as thaton further development.   In the first year the loan charges on new development will be only a small proportion of the total, certainly lessthan  5 millions in a total of perhaps  40 millions.(d) The grants in respect of the remaining loan charges on pastcapital expenditure would be regarded as a discouragement to those whohave been financially prudent.   Up to the war, some local authorities had a considered policy of financing capital expenditure out of revenue to the maximum extent practicable;   and during the war a numberexpedited their locn   repayments.   They would now lose thereby.(e) If we re-introduce percentage grants exceeding 50, we are opento the criticism, out of our own mouths, that they are an incentive to expenditure;  while we shall invite demands to increase the percentages of those below 50, in particular the grant towards old people&apos;s homes.(f) The removal of the planning and other capital grants from thegeneral grant (even though they are quantitatively small) would reduceits range, make education even more obviously the predominant service,and reduce the validity of the &quot;swings and roundabouts&quot; argument infavour of the general grant.(g) If capital expenditure (especially on education) were taken outof the Bill, the fears of the teaching profession that it is the intentionof the Government to encourage local authorities to oppose increases of teachers&apos; salaries, or the reduction of the size of classes, would be confirmed, because salaries would be left as the only important point at which local authorities were left with discretion to control their expenditure.   It would be particularly unfortunate to intensify the teachersopposition to the Bill at a time when a negotiation on salaries is pending.(h) So far from being moderated, the educational opposition to theBill might well be encouraged to renew its campaign by a concessions which at this late stage would certainly be.regarded as an abandonment of the arguments on which the Government have relied all this time.(i) No local authority association nor any individual local authority has asked for this change.   Their attitude is uncertain;   much might turnon the rates of grant offered.   They would be astounded by the volte face;and certainly they would   expect   to be consulted before the government announced such a fundamental departure in policy.G.I-1,Ministry of Education, W.l.17th May, 1958
