C.(58) 101COPY NO10th May, 1958CABINETWAGES POLICY:   NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of health on 27th March the Cabinet discussed the terms on whichstaff should be assimilated to the new scale of salary and pay structureto be introduced for general grades of administrative and clerical staffin the hospital service (C.C.(58) 26th Conclusions, Minute 3).Negotiations in the Whitley Council have broken down so far as thegeneral grades are concerned.   These are, roughly speaking, thoseoffice staff at present earning under  1,200 a year.   The Staff Sidehave rejected as a matter of principle the assimilation proposals putforward by the Management Side.   These were designed to limit boththe immediate cost of the award and the amount of increase receivedthis year by individuals.2.        The Staff Side proposed that the question of assimilationand date of implementation should be referred to the Industrial Courton the basis that all other matters had been agreed.    The ManagementSide rejected this proposal and told the Staff Side that a reference tothe Court of the entire &apos;package&apos; was not ruled out, provided suitable terms of reference could be agreed.   Infoimal talks to agree terms ofreference were suspended because the Staff Side claimed the right, inaccordance   with Health Service Whitley Council practice, to refer tothe detailed course of the recent negotiations when stating their case.3.        The record of discussions would reveal that certain scaleswere offered by the Management Side and that at a later stage the staff side said that they accepted them.     The record, however, contains twostatements made on behalf of the Management Side and noted by theStaff Side, which set out my views on the bearing that the current economicsituation must have on the negotiations and on the method of bringing into effect such new scales as might be agreed.4.        I am informed that in Civil Service Whitley practice negotiations are on the clear understanding that offers by either side which are made subject to a final settlement are not to be quoted in arbitration, except with the express agreement of the party making the offer.     Health Servicepractice has not made the same clear distinction and the detailed course of negotiation has normally been quotable in full.   I am satisfied that it wouldbe impossible for me to say to the Whitley Council that reference of thepresent dispute to the Industrial Court could be made only if the staff side undertook not to refer to the course of the recent negotiations.   I also consider that there are advantages as well as disadvantages for theManagement Side if references are made.-1-t 4(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5.        I therefore propose to agree to a reference to the industrial court on the basis that what is put before the Court is the entire&quot;package1 - grades, scales and assimilation - so that the ManagementSide will be able to put in issue not only the assimilation arrangements proposed by the Staff Side but also the scales proposed in their claimas well.D.W-S.Ministry of Health, W.l.9th May, 1958-2-
