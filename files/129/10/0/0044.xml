PROPOSED STATEMENT 3Y MINISTER OF FUEL AND PO\iER.The Government have reached the conclusion that to getthe coal needed for our expanding industrial production and domestic consumption over the next few years it is essentialthat more boys and men should voluntarily enter the coal mining industry than has been the case in recent years.I have accordingly been considering what stops can betaken to attract additional recruits and    in particular1, theproposals made to that end by the N.U.M.&apos;in the Miners&apos;Charter.Certain items in the Charter cover the reorganisation ofthe industry together with better provision for training,health and safety,  end action upon many of these is already being taken.      There are also other proposals, of which themost important is that for&apos; a 5 day week, which has always been -regarded as a specially desirable reform for the coal mining industry in view of the conditions under which miners work.Normally this would have been for consideration by theindustry through the established conciliation machinery.It is clear that the present owners could not be expectedto undertake the responsibility for negotiations with theUnion on a major dsaue of this kind on which any agreement reached must have far reaching effects on the future workingof the industry for which they will bear no direct responsibility.Nor are the members designate of the National Goal Board,which has not boon and cannot yet be legally constituted assuch and has not yet the necessary staff,  in a position to embark on ouch negotiations.      On the other hand, in theGovernment&apos;s view an early announcement on this issue ise sscntial.Accordingly I take this opportunity of announcing thatthe Government favour the proposal in principle,  provided thatarrangements and conditions can be established with the full co-operation of the miners, for an organised 5 day week of a kind which will secure the output of coal which is necessaryto meet the country&apos;s needs.      It is vital to attract morerecruits to the industry to secure the  coal supplies which weshall need over the next few years.      It is equally vital toproduce as much coal as possible for the country&apos;s immediate requirements.While the Government favour the proposal in principleprovided there is acceptance of the conditions which will secure the necessary output, the working out of the scheme indetail is a matter to be undertaken within the industry itself, and will proceed as soon as the Goal Industry-Nationalisation Bill becomes law and the N.C.B. is constituted.The Minors&apos;  Charter also contained proposals for anadditional weeks&apos;s holiday with pay and payment for the sixstatutory and customary holidays.      The Government cannotentertain the proposal for an additional weokks holiday inaddition to that for a 5 day week.     ,The,suggestion that payment should, be made for the six statutory and customary

holidays is on a different footing provided payment for the holiday Is made conditional on full attendance during theweek in which it falls.      As however it would, involve paymentbeing nfa.de before&apos; the constitution of the N.G.B. , I have boonin touch v/ith the Mining Association and at my request theyhave agreed to enter into discussions with representativesof the National Union through the established conciliation machinery of the industry with a view to agreement being reached in regard to the method and amount of such holidaypayments in time for the first payment to be made in respectof the Bank Holiday falling on 5th August.
