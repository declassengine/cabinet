(46) 21124^ May, 1946.CABINETRELAXATION OF THE BAN ON MARRIAGES between british SERVICEMEN AND ALIEN WOMENMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. In view of the representations that are being made and pressed by Members ofParliament and others that marriages should be permitted between British Servicemenand Austrian women, I consider it desirable that the present position, which is not entirely satisfactory, should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.2. In March, 1945, the War Cabinet (W.M. (45) 29th Conclusions, Minute 4)considered, as part of the policy of non-fraternization, that everything possible shouldbe done to discourage marriages between British Servicemen and German women; their decision did not, however, cover Austria, which was not then within the Allied Armies&apos;sphere of operations. Such marriages were therefore forbidden by order of the C.-in-C.as part of the policy of non-fraternization.A similar policy has been applied to marriages between British Servicemen and austrian women, except that, in view of the generally more lenient policy towardsAustria, in very special circumstances marriages have been permitted, mainly those ofBritish ex-prisoners of war who were befriended by Austrian families whilst they wereprisoners of war and sometimes aided in escaping, and who, in consequence, becameengaged to Austrian women before their liberation.In the case of other aliens (viz., Hungarians, Bulgarians, Finns and Roumanians)no instructions have been issued and it has been left to Commanders-in-Chief to applysuch policy as they thought fit on grounds of security. In B.A.O.R. a General RoutineOrder has been issued forbidding all such marriages, but allowing cases which arethought to merit special consideration to be submitted individually. In C.M.F., onthe other hand, no ban has been imposed and soldiers have been allowed to marry,e.g., Hungarians, if there is no security or other objection. I understand that twomarriages with Hungarians have been sanctioned to date in Germany and three inC.M.F.3. In my opinion the present ban should be relaxed to the extent of allowingmarriages between British Servicemen and alien women (other than German and japanese see below) if the local military commander considers the reasons for the marriage are good and subject to there being no security objection. I am advised thatthe security standard required should be a strict one and that before approval is givento any particular case, the woman concerned and her whole family must be quite clearof any suspicion.4. The original policy of non-fraternization was concerted with the Americans andI would propose that they should be informed of our intention if my suggestion is approved.5. I suggest that the question of marriages with German women should be considered separately at a later date. The legal position in regard to prohibition isat present being-examined, and before asking for a decision on the matter, I would like to obtain theviews of the Commander-in-Chief, and I propose that a letter should be sent to him inthe terms of the draft attached at Appendix A. It will be noted that I include in this letter authority for him to allow marriages in very exceptional circumstances. I thinkhe should have discretion to decide when circumstances are such as to warrant an exception being made.The question of allowing marriages with Japanese women should also, in my view,be left in abeyance for the present. It is additionally complicated by reason of thefact that agreement will have to be sought with the American, Dominion and Indian
Governments; and the fact that a marriage with a Japanese is a &quot; mixed marriage &quot;is a further difficulty. I do not imagine that there will be strong political or publicpressure for this ban to be lifted for the present, at any rate.6. I understand that the Foreign Secretary is in sympathy with the above proposals.7. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to approve:  (a) my proposal to authorize local military commanders to relax the present banon marriage between British Servicemen and alien women, other thanGerman and Japanese, if the reasons are good and provided there is nosecurity objection;(6) the continuance of the ban on marriage between British Servicemen and Germanwomen, with exceptions only in very special cases;(c) the continuance of the ban on marriage between British Servicemen and japanese women.The War Office,24th May, 1946.APPENDIX AIn March, T945, the War Cabinet, in discussing matters in connection with theoccupation of German&apos; territory, and especially the fraternization problem, decided thatmarriages between members of H.M. Forces and German subjects in Germany shouldbe prohibited. A like restriction was extended, as a corollary to the Cabinet decision,to Austrian subjects as soon as British Forces occupied Austrian territory.Inquiries have been made in recent months, through Parliamentary, Ministerialand other channels whether and when the ban on marriages with German and Austriannationals is likely to be lifted, while recently representation has been received on behalfof members of the Jewish Brigade that special exception should be made to the rule in their favour and allow them to marry refugee and D.P. Jewesses notwithstandingtheir German or Austrian nationality.One outcome of the inquiries is a decision to re-examine afresh the legal positionin respect of the prohibition and to seek the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crownin the matter.Meanwhile the C.-in-C. British Troops in Austria has represented that the banimposed on British soldiers under his command on marriage with Austrian women shouldbe lifted at an early date, on the grounds that the rule applied to Austrian women whencompared with the position obtaining in regard to the Italian, is a cause of dissatisfaction,whereas most men consider the Austrian girl as better suited to be the wife of anEnglishman than some or most Italians.The question of relaxing the ban on marriage with Austrian, and with other alienwomen other than German and Japanese, is about to be submitted to the Cabinet.It may well be that the Cabinet will desire to take an early decision on the questionof the ban on marriages. with Germans, and in anticipation of this, I shall be most grateful if you will say whether you consider the ban should or should not be maintained,having regard especially to the morale and well-being of the men under your command.Pending a decision, the Secretary of State, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, has decided to give you discretion to allow marriages with Germans in very exceptional circumstances. It is not desired to fetter your discretion in this matter in any way, but in coming to a decision, which should be that of yourself, your Deputyor&apos;of the C.-in-C. or his colleagues in the other two Services personally, you will doubtless be guided by the compassionate circumstances on which the application is based as wellas by normal considerations of security. Taken by itself, the fact that if a marriageis not sanctioned, a child would be born out of wedlock would not, in the opinion ofMinisters, warrant the exercise of your discretion, though it would doubtless be a factorto be taken into consideration with others in framing your decision.(B46/13)   110   5/46   W.O.P.   25737
