ANNEX IINDEX 70 14th June,  1946.Following to Prime minister from Cabinet Delegation and Viceroy.Position regarding Interim Government which was reported in the Secretary of State&apos;s Telegram INDEX 67 ofthe 12th June has now reached critical phase.      Viceroy hasinduced Jinnah to say that if he can be assured that Congresswill accept a Government composed of equal representation of congress and Muslim league plus one scheduled casterepresentative who would be Congress and two other minorityrepresentatives, he will put that to his working committee.Viceroy is still trying to induce Congress to accept on that basis.      Congress want Council of 15 and have suggested 5Congress, k Muslim League,  1  Independent Muslim and1  scheduled caste (Congress),  1 Sikh, 1  Indian Christian and1 woman who would be  in fact a well-known Congress lady the ughnot a Hindu.      There  is no hope of agreement to  that from the muslim League.2. If we cannot get the  agreement of Congress on thebasis of 13 as above, we do not think that further discussions are likely to produce any result.      The  situation is worseningthrough the prolonged delay.      We therefore propose  to issue astatement text of which is contained in my next succeedingtelegram and Viceroy will issue  invitations at once to personsmentioned in paragraph h.    &apos; You will see that we havecompromised on Id members but have chosen minority representatives who are likely to be reasonably neutral.      The important pointin this statement is the penultimate paragraph by which we  shallbe bound,  if there is refusal to co-operate,  to proceed toform interim Government on the most representative basispossible.As there  is nothing in this statement which goesbeyond general instructions received from you we are proposing if necessary to issue it within  the  next 2h hours.Informal approval of King has been sought through,India office by immediately preceding telegram.

ANNEX II

INDEX 71

14th June, 1946

For Prime Minister from Cabinet Delegation and Viceroy.

Following is text of Statement referred to in our immediately preceding telegram.

Begins.

His Excellency the Viceroy, in consultation with the members of the Cabinet Mission, has for some time been exploring the possibilities of forming a Coalition Government drawn from the two major parties and certain of the minorities. The discussions have revealed the difficulties which exist for the two major parties in arriving at any agreed basis for the formation of such a Government.

The Viceroy and the Cabinet Mission appreciate these difficulties and the efforts which the two parties have made to meet them. They consider however that no useful purpose can be served by farther prolonging these discussions. It is indeed urgently necessary that the best and most representative Interim Government should be set up to conduct the very heavy and important business that has to be carried through.

The Viceroy is therefore issuing invitations to the following to serve as members of the Interim Government:

Nehru, Rajagopalachari, Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Mahatab (Prime Minister of Orissa), Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan, Nazimuddin, Nishtar, Mohammed Ismail, Matthai, Jagjivan Ram, Baldev Singh, and one other minority representative. If any of those invited is unable for personal reasons to accept, the Viceroy will after consultation invite some other person in his place.

The Viceroy will arrange the distribution of portfolios in consultation with the leaders of the two major parties.

The above composition of the Interim Government is in no way to be taken as a precedent for the solution of any other communal question. It is an expedient put forward to solve the present difficulty only, and to obtain the best possible coalition Government.

The Viceroy and the Cabinet Mission believe that Indians of all communities desire to arrive at a speedy settlement of this matter so that the process of constitution-making can go forward and that the Government of India may be carried on as efficiently as possible in the meantime.

They therefore hope that all parties especially the two major parties will accept this proposal so as to overcome the present obstacles and will co-operate for the successful carrying on of the Interim Government.



In the event of the two major parties or either of them(roving unwilling to join in the setting up of a Coalitionovernrnent on the above lines, it is the intention of the Viceroyo proceed with the formation of an Interim Government which wille as representative as possible in order to carry on theovernment of India while  the constitution-making proceeds.The Viceroy is also directing the Governors of theJrovinces to summon the Provincial Legislative Assembliesforthwith to proceed with the elections necessary for theit ting up of the constitution-making machinery as put forwardI] the statement of 16th May.        Ends.ANNEX IIIBIN 26lbth June, 19u7,For Cabinet Delegation from Prime Minister.Your INDEX 70 and 71.I approve draft Statement which is in consonancelth the general views expressed by the Cabinet.
