WORLD FOOD SUPPLIESi^PEPPg^^yatcment by -one Lord Presidentof the GoonciJ^iin^No one now questions that the world is rapidly-heading for famine^   nor is it questioned that the threat offamine is no passing crisis, but is a continuing peril whichwill hang over us at the very least until the harvest of 191+7reaches the cons mier.      The political and economic consequences of famine on this scale are difficult to predictsince no really comparable disaster has ever hit the community of civilised nations *      We kn o w that a1r eady ou t p ut isdropping in the affected areas to a low level and respect for law and order is breaking down in the  stimulus to get food byfair means or foul..      We cannot measure  statistically the&apos;switch over from production of coal and other useful goods to production of future Fascists, but we can be quite sure thatit is taking olacc      We know from experience after the last war that the one output figure which can be counted on to go up in these circumstances is the output of mischievousextremistSo      The consequences of famine are not  just amatter of nutrition, but of economics,  politics,   and evenstrategy..    - Enough food to live on is the basis of the wholesocial and economic fabric,  and it is this foundation whichis cracking before our eyes-.Within the United Kingdom,  as the crisis gathered,the Prime Minister set up machinery on the lines of the battle of the Atlantic Committee which directed all energiesagainst the U-Boat as a matter of priority during the middlepart of the war.      This machine has worked well within thelimits of its  jurisdicfj on..      Unfortunately,   food cannot betreated as other than a world-wide problem either from theproduction or the consumption angle.      All nations are involved in it and even unanimous agreements by Governments

to produce more and useless are peculiarly dependent for theirfulfilment on the understanding and the will of immensenumbers of individual men and women,      Unfortunately,   theworld has been caught       the famine threat in an awkwardinterregnum between the wartime Combined Pood Board set-up,the various transition period arrangements such as iPIwR P, A-and the Emergency Economic Council for Europe,  and thelong-term set-up represented by the Pood and agriculture organisation of the united Nations..      There has been no oneformal body with satisfactory terms of reference andmembership to tackle the whole famine threat in all its aspects oPending a solution of this problem which is nowbeing worked out at the Pood and Agriculture Conference in washington.;   the Cabinet considered that special inter-governmental talks at a high level were necessary through theUnited Kingdom,  United States and Canadian Governments  (thatis,   the three governments to whom the Combined Pood Boardreports)o      On our initiative  the united  States and canadian government&apos;s have now discussed with us at a high level themost urgent elements in the world food and agriculture problem with particular reference to wheat,   and the measures whichthey and we are adopting to meet the menace^There has been a temptation to say that a matterlike agriculture is the exclusive concern of each nation,  butthe facts are demolishing this attitude.      I told thePresident,   and I told His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada,   thatthere was no aspect of British food and agriculture which Iwas not willing to discuss with a view to their makingcriticisms and suggestions if the point had: any bearing on theprevention of famine *      I made it no less clear that Iexpected them to take the same attitude-     -Both Governmentsshowed themselves fully aware of this need for raising the fight against famine not only to the highest level of priority/

but also to a plane above all petty considerations ofnational pride-      I wanted to find out whether we weresupposed to be dealing with famine on the basis of each nation contributing to.the full extent of its ability,whatever inconveniences and even hardships might have to be faced in the process-      I &quot;had the clearest assurances from both the united States and Canadian Governments that theywere resolved to work with us on that footing-.In these, circumstances I and my colleagues in -theGovernment felt,   as I am sure the House will feel,  that britain could neither stand aside,  nor afford to bevictimised-      I laid detailed evidence before the UnitedStates Government to show that we in Britain have,   in proportion to our resources, given the world a lead in this.matter-      Our agricultural community is in all thedcircumstances doing wonders.      The British consumer also has accepted more austerity for more years and. has played the    **game better in fairly working a fair rationing scheme than any other body of consumers I can think of-      I included asummary of cur various measures in this field in theannouncement which was issued in Washington on the 17th May,and which will be inserted in the Official Report for the convenience of Honourable Members-In a starving world we cannot defend to ourselves -quite apart from what other nations might think. - any policyexcept contribution to the utmost extent of our ability;    thatis and has been our policy,   and I was agreeably surprised bythe deep conviction of this,  not only in Canada, but in theUnited States..      Our present and past sacrifices have hurt,but they have certainly given us a remarkable degree of moral&apos;leadership in this matter among the nations of the world-The immediate occasion of ray Mission to Washingtonwas the emergence of some disturbing misunderstandingsregarding responsibility for,  and ability to supply,   India

2.2and the British Zone of Germany.      It was widely felt in theUnited States that since V,E.  Day we had continued to maintainstocks at an unnecessarily high level,   and that in view ofthe imminent world, famine  threat and the fact that most other nations claim to he getting along on no more than J or it-weeks&apos;   supply,  we should make some contribution not from cuttingour consumption but by economising the amount of wheat lockedup in that long pipe-line which stretches from the Canadianprairies,  through &quot;the St.  Lawrence to the ports,  mills,bakeries,   and finally stomachs in the U.-. K.      I explained tothe Do 8)   Government with the utmost force and in detail thereasons why we feel that the exceptional effort now beingmade by the British people to carry out their commitments forwinning the peace cannot be assured without approximately thequantity of wheat which is now moving through the supplypipe-line.      I did not feel that in spite of having gone sofar earlier,  the British people would wish to be represented as the only ones who were making no abatement Of any sort intheir current demands in view of the vast gap of nearly three-quarters of a million tons monthly between May-Septemberscreened demands for bread grains and. world supplies in sightfor the  same period.       I therefore  (with the authority of theGovernment) most reluctantly agreed to reduce our importclaims during the period up to September by 200,300 tons asan outright sacrifice without any condition of replacement.This is undoubtedly&apos; a&quot; most hazardous step to take, but thewhole world food situation is hazardous and moreover our ownhazard, as an importing country dependent as we are on supplies from others might well have been increased rather thandiminished In the long-run by assuming a rigidly negative attitude on this critical occasion.      The scale of the sacrifice must, however,  be viewed in perspective.      Itamounts to little over 10:-% of our import programme.      In anemergency of this kind it seems not unreasonable  that -we- k -

might expect to make an economy of this limited proportion bythe use of some of the types of &quot;emergency measure which had tobe adopted in blitz conditions when the  dangers to the united nations on&apos; the food front were certainly no greater than theyare now.      Every effort will be made to cope with this reducedsupply by extra administrative ingenuity and effort ratherthan by further cuts on the British consumer..Regrettable as this cut in our import programme isit forms part of an agreement whose benefits promise to be substantial      In the first place,  the united StatesGovernment have agreed that the criticism that has been run inAmerica against the levels of United Kingdom stocks will nowbe regarded by the Administration as definitely and finallymet by the  sacrifice which we have made-      Largely on thestrength of this reinforcement,   they have now felt able toaassociate themselves unreservedly with the task of supplyingIndia and the British Zone of Germany on the same basis thatthey will supply any other claims,   that is,   to the full extent that available resources allowo      Sc far as Germany isconcerned they have accepted the proposition that there shouldcnot be a starving or a more under-fed British Zione in Germanyside by side with an American Zone which is getting assuredfood supplies,  but that both zones shall work up to the same-standard of rationing and shall have the same degree of assurance that their supplies will not suddenly come to an end.These are great advantages and our decisions - whichiare right in themselves - depended for their adoption on the mutual confidence that there was no holding back in sacrificeson either side-      It is very difficult and probablyunprofitable to try to measure the efforts of one country against another,  but I would say that the Americans are nowmost thoroughly aware of the importance of diverting food to europe and are making diversions &quot;which,  at least in somecases,   are upsetting their own system of distribution and are- 5 -

instrumental in closing some of the flour mills-      What seven more  important,   they have now changed the price ratio inorder that farmers may find it more profitable to sell grainas human food rather than to feed it to livestock-      It hasalways been difficult to tell in that huge and loose-knitcountry just what effect any given decision will yield,   andthose effects are dependent on the spirit behind the decisionrather than on an integrated administrative machine as we know ito      Nevertheless,   as the President said to me,   &quot;Whensomething must be done we usually do it&quot;,  and in the light of american performance in the field of the war effort when their concern was fully engaged,   it would be rash and also unfair toassume that these measures which are now being applied with somuch energy throughout the United States will not in due course give resuits-His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada readily associateditself with the general lines  of the conclusions reached in washington at which in fact their own Ambassador had been present-      A joint announcement to this effect was issued in ottawa on 20th May and will be inserted in the Official Report-Canada is of course not only a huge exporter of wheat and otherfoods,  but is very export-minded and above all is. minded to export the utmost possible to the United Kingdom on groundsboth of interest and of sentiment;    while the nature of theCanadian administration and control over wheat makes theproblem of ways and means less difficult than it is in theunited States-      I cannot do  justice to the encouragement whichwe are, receiving from the Canadian attitude in this matter atthis moment.-.      Their cordiality and affection for this &apos;country and the spirit in which they are facing political difficulties in order to deliver the wheat are wonderful.      Iwas particularly glad to meet Mr -  James Gardiner,   theDominion Minister for Agriculture,   and to be personalls&apos;convinced that we are moving.abreast in these matters-- G -

22nd May,  19lf6.In conclusion I would say that if my talks withthe United States and-Canadian Governments are any guide weare now on the way to creating the same type of spirit andurgency about food for winning the peace which we created for resources for winning the war      It is becoming more andmore obvious that the world must, by concerted measures andsacrifices,   get on top of famine if famine is not very shortly to get on top of the world.      Only if all countries will put their houses in order and implement all measureswhich,   in their peculiar circumstances,   are calculated to make,available the greatest supply of bread grains will the crisisbe overcome and the world be able to turn to more constructive and congenial tasks.
