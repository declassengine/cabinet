THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITA:CP. (46)  22k(Also C. 0. S. (h-6)  156 (0))7TH JUKE 19^6CABINETREVISION OP ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATYReport by Chiefs of StaffWe have been asked, as a matter of urgency, toexamine the Foreign secretary latest proposals forthe revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty as set outin CP, (46) 219.    The background against which we seethis problem is briefly as follows.2.      On the 28th December, the Chiefs of Staff, atthe request of the Foreign Office, prepared a paper (C.0.8. (45)  699 (0))  setting out the military requirements, both in peace and war, which must besecured under the Treaty.    These are summarisedas follows -&quot;3.     War.    In war we are likely to have to conduct operations based on Egypt.    We shall,therefore, require in war the.full facilities in that country which we have enjoyed in this war.9. Peace. -;-0ur communications through Egypttogether with the necessary facilities must be assured to us in peace.In addition,  it will be necessary inpeace to maintain or develop base installations in Egypt,  for the use of our forces in war.The Egyptians will clearly be unable to undertake this work without British assistance and we shall,therefore, need, a certain number of technical and. specialist personnel permanently in egypt to ensure the preparedness and efficiency of ourbase.    It may be possible for a considerable-proportion of these personnel to have civilian &apos;It will not be necessary to maintain largoforces in Egypt in pea*e.    We do, however,require a small land force which would be-available, if required,  to ensure the protectionof our administrative personnel and establishments of all three Services and of ourvital communications in the event of internalstatus.

disorder;    we do not consider that we can relyentirely on the Egyptians for the safety of these interests.    Some air force units will he necessaryto provide a stiffening to the Egyptian air defences and a nucleus from which we can expand in anemergency.It is not necessary that our forces shouldhe in the Nile Valley except in so far as isnecessary to supervise the preparation andmaintenance of &quot;base installations.    Moreover,they.should he represented to the Egyptians asbeing required, not for any internal securitycommitment, but as our immediate contributionto the defence of the Middle East as a whole.&quot;X   X   X   X3.      On 18th January, the.Foreign Secretary circulated a Memorandum to the Cabinet (CP. (46) 17), which included the following passage -&quot;I also agree with the advice of the Chiefsof Staff that it is essential to press for facilities for the maintenance of British land andair forces in Egypt in time of peace in order thatthe aid to he given in. emergency may be effective and sufficiently speedy,&quot;4.      On the 15th. April t the Chiefs of Staff circulated a Report  (&quot;P. 0.(46)  56)  examining a suggestion made by the&quot;Foreign Secretary that our Delegation for the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty discussions should be given authority tostate the following policy at the outset, it being understood that the projected withdrawal would he carriedout by stages --&quot;(a)  The complete evacuation from Egypt of allcombatant     British troops.(b) The.&quot;maintenance by Egypt, with Britishcollaboration, of Naval, land, and Airadministrative and air defence organisations.(c) Permission for the transit of troops and aircraft, and for the maintenance requirementsof the transit organisation.(d) The creation of a Regional Headquartersto be located in the Canal Zone.(e) The provision of equipment for theE gyp11an forces.&quot;

more relevant extracts from this, report are as follows&quot;4.      Our comments en the five points in theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposal are as follows -Evacuation of Troops(a) Royal- Navy.    There are no Navalimplications, as it was not intended to Station anynaval combatant forces in Egypt in peas3time. &apos;Army.    We would have diked to haveretained a garrison in the Canal Zone for theprotection of our administrative personnel and establishments,, and. of our vital communications in the event of internal disorder.    The presenceof such a force would have retained a foothold on egyptian territory from which we would have beenable to defend our interests in the country if need be.    The Canal Zone, however, is away from themain centres of &quot;population, and therefore from the   .potential seats of internal disorder.    We therefore consider that for normal internal security and theprotection of British personnel,  the presence ofBritish troops in the Canal Zone is desirable, but cannot be regarded as essential.   We thereforeagree that oar delegation could propose thecomplete evacuation of all combatant Army troops,if the term combatant is clearly interpreted as not applicable to those troops required for running the bo.se.R.A.F.      In order to ensure in war the air defence of Egypt and the Middle East as a whole,it is most desirable that we should maintain an airgarrison in Egypt in peace.. In war, attack from theair is likely to come quickly and in greaterstrength than the Egyptians can possibly hope todeal with.    The Egyptian Air Force is not at presentnor is it likely in the near .future to be,  soconstituted as to be able to undertake the air defence of the country without considerable aid.Moreover, it is impossible to ensure the air defenceof Egypt from any one area of the country, such asthe Canal Zone.    We should therefore wish to obtainthe right to Base fighter squadrons in the canal zone, and in conjunction with the Egyptians toconstruct and develop airfields, a signalsnetwork, and radar installations, as required inEgypt,    An interpretation of the clause &quot;completeevacuation of all combatant British troops&quot;,  ifthis includes fighter squadrons and the fighterdefence organisation, is therefore militarilyunac c ep t ah 1 e.

If, however, it is thought to he absolutely necessary for political reasons that the fighter squadrons should also be withdrawn, we suggestthat the delegation should be authorised tonegotiate on the following &quot;basis:-The maintenance op effective air defence is vital, not only for the defence of Egypt but aspart of the overall air defence of the middle east.      This involves the maintenance in peace by the Egyptians with British collaboration,of airfields, a signals network, radarinstallations, and an administrative organisation.It also means the presence of an appropriatescale of fighter squadrons.      It is hoped thatin due course the Egyptian Air Porce will bo ableto create and. maintain fighter squadrons insufficient number, and possessing a sufficientdegree of. efficiency, to provide the peacetimegarrison.     When this stage has been reached,R. A. P ,  fighter squadrons will be withdrawn,though arrangements will have to be made fortheir immediate return in the event of anemergency, and for periods of combined Anglo-Egyptian air defence training in peacetime.In addition to Air Defences there must bebases in Egypt from which we can operate longrange strategical air forces in war.     We canconcede that&quot;such bases could ultimately bemaintained, by  the Egyptians, but for many years to come British expert technical advice and ,supervision will be necessa^, therefore the hand over to the Egyptians must be a gradualprocess.      We must at all times retain the rightto move squadrons to these bases periodicallyfor training and to ensure that the maintenanceis adequate for war purposes.      We must alsoensure the right to having these bases kept up-to-date with modern developments, which may involve improvements from time to time, and wemust be the authority on the need for suchimprovements.Administrative Organisation(b) We consider that the broad terms of the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals would meet our requirements in anticipation of war.      The administrative installations whichmust be maintained In Egypt are shown in the Appendix andAnnexures to this report.      As far as possible these should bemaintained by the Egyptians, but it will be necessary for usto help them with advice and technical assistance.      certain of these installations are essential at the present time tothe maintenance of our forces in Palestine and elsewhere,and these will require to be operated mainly by british personnel.X X X6.      We conclude that the British delegation should&apos; beauthorised to open negotiations by making proposals on the

lines of the &quot;foreign Secretary&apos;s five points,  subjectto the following modification -&quot;If possible, the withdrawal of combatanttroops should not include fighter squadrons,but the delegation should, have discretion tonegotiate on the basis set oat in paragraph h(a) and (h) above.&quot;5.      On 17th April a telegram was received from our delegation in Cairo (ho. 679)  reporting that the ambassador and Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East estimated thatthe best chance of getting our military requirements wasto start by offering complete evacuation of all Britishtroops and hot only of combatant troops.      The telegramwent on to say that unless a promise of complete evacuationwithout conditions was made,  the Egyptian Delegation mightrefo.se to open negotiation,  the Government might fall, andthere might be grave disorders.3m       On 18th April,  the Chiefs of Staff sent their comments on the above  telegram to the foreign Office.      their conclusion was as follows -&quot;We conclude that anything less than the reduced requirements to which we had previouslyagreed, is unacceptable from a military point ofview.Since the attainment of these  reducedrequirements would depend, under the latest proposals,  on a gamble on Egypt&apos;s goodwill,we are of the opinion that the risk is too great to take.1&apos;7*       On 22nd. April, a telegram (no.  713) was received from our Delegation in Cairo, strongly recommending that weshould offer complete evacuation of all British troops from egypt, and should make a public announcement to that effect at the opening of the negotiations.      This telegram included the following passage -&quot;There is little doubt that the egyptians would meet us half way in facilitating operationof any scheme worked, put on these lines and ofcourse  they would, give us complete freedom ofaction in Egypt at a time of apprehendedemergency and in&apos;war.      But it would be wrong toimagine  that this plan would get us everythingwe want in peacetime.     -Strategical implicationsare likely to be serious.-     Nevertheless weshould secure Egyptian friendship and co-operation in full measure and this  is surelysomething that is worth more than a positiongained at the point of the bayonet.&quot;

8., On 24th April, the Chiefs of Staff submitted theirviews on this proposal to the Prime Minister., The moreimportant extracts are as follows -&quot;(i) We have examined Telegram No. 713 fromthe Secretary of State for Air in Cairo, andhave had the comments of the Commanders-in-chief in their telegram No. 81/CCL.    Our views areas follows.(2)  The alternative courses of action are put forward by our delegation in Cairo -(a) To go forward to formal negotiationswith the Egyptian delegation on thebasis of the instructions given toour delegation in F.O.  telegrams-   :Nos 718 and 719:(b) To announce at the opening of formalnegotiations that we are proposing towithdraw all British armed forces froinEgyptian soil, end to negotiate withthe object of arranging details of thiswithdrawal and of making satisfactory arrangements for mutual, assistance in emergency.X    X   X.   X(5) We are thus on the horns of a dilemma.    Onthe one hand,  the political effect of pressing for our full requirements involves the risk,which the local advisers regard as a practicalcertainty, of(a) Disorders necessitating the despatchof.considerable reinforcements to egypt to restore and maintain order:(b) Permanently ruining; our relations with egypt:    and(c) Being pilloried in the Security Council.On the other hand, we stand to secure the friendly co-operation of Egypt, but by a definitesacrifice to our military position.    Of the two,we consider the latter to be the lesser of thetwo evils.&quot;X    X   X   X

9.    &quot;The latest position as  disclosed by CP(46)219i.s that the Egyptian Delegation have refused to embodyin a new Treaty any clause which would give us thefacilities which we require in the event of war or the imminent throat of war.    They argue that we should getwhat wo require through &quot;staff conversations and agreements between the military authorities of the twocountries.&quot;    In our view such agreements would not be worth the paper on which they were written.    Apart fromthe fact that the function of military authorities isinherently advisory/ the Egyptian military authoritiesare not only completely incompetent but also devoid of influence or prestige with their Government or theircountrymen.    In other words,  this latest proposalinvolves yet another retreat from a position which wasadmittedly at very best a gamble.    We have no hesitation in saying that from the point of view of thesecurity of our vital interests in the whole Middle Eastarea,  it is completely unacceptable.10.      It remains therefore to find an alternative.In attempting to do so we recognise that wo areencroaching into the political field, but in a problemof this kind it is impossible to draw a hard and fastline between what is political and what is military.11*   It seems to us that there is a tendency on thepart not only of the Egyptian Government but also of others to underrate British rights and British interestsin this matter.     The following are some of the facts,boldly stated:-(i).   We have twice saved Egypt, but - we have only been able to do so because we have hadthe necessary facilities.(ii)     At the end of a world war there is boundto be a lot of clearing up to be done.    Itcannot be expected that all the vastinstallations and arrangements which are involved in waging total war can be cleared away immediately the fightingstops.    After all the period ofemergency is still in force.

(iii) It is true that foreign troops,  enemyprisoners and military dumps are stillon Egyptian soil, Put is this a hardshipcomparable to what we, their Allies, haveto bear, with conscription still in forceand vast occupational forces all over theworld?   And is it in any way comparable to what they would have had. to bear hadwe not saved, them?(iv) We are doing our very best to clear out theDelta with all speed.    We should have thoughtthat there would be no harm in telling the egyptians that the Chiefs of Staffinstructed the Commanders-in-Chief,Middle East as far back as the 30thApril, 1946 that it was imperative toget out of Cairo at the earliestpossible moment, and. that they followedthis up on the 30th May with a peremptoryorder (0.0.S.(M.E.) 87).(v) We cannot get away from geography.    It sohappens that Egypt occupies a uniqueposition in relation to the group of states known as the British Commonweolthof Nations.    In the long run, therefore,the security of this area is as vital tothe British as it is to the Egyptiansthemselves,  and we surely cannot beexpected to forego our minimum security requirements there.   When one thinks ofthe steps that Hussia has taken in theBaltic and. the Balkan States to secureher frontiers, surely what we are askingin Egypt is a very little thing?(vi) We went to the limit of our militaryconcessions in our oxjening offer in the hopeof securing the goodwill of the Egyptians.The only response we have obtained is toreceive further pressure to withdraw ourrequests for our minimum military facilities.&apos;12.    In our opinion, the above points should be emphasised, as strongly as possible to the egyptian government.13-     We consider that the facts set out inparagraph 11 give us the right to demand that satisfactory arrangements for mutual assistance in emergency or in time of apprehended internationalemergency should be publicly recognised by theEgyptian Government, in such a way as to form an integral part of any revised Agreement which may be negotiated.

14-    Prom the foregoing, it will he seen that the revised Draft Treaty proposed, hy the Foreign secretary in.CP. (46)  219 does not meet our minimum military requirements unless it is fundamentally altered in thefo11owing respects a(a) Article 53    There is no mention of the&quot;menace of war&quot; or of &quot;an apprehendedinternational emergency&quot;.    It mustcover the pre-war period:    otherwiseour measures will he too late.    the phrase &quot;apprehended internationalemergency&quot; should therefore he inserted after &quot;the event of war&quot;.(h) Article 4 of the draft Protocol should nolonger he in the form of a note hutbecome a definite part of the Protocol.Furthermore:, it would have to set out infull detail the minimum military facilities which we requiree(c) If Article 5 and Article 4 of the draftProtocol are revised as above, Article 4of the Treaty would become redundant.and could be omitted.15:    If, en the other hand, H.M.G.  should, despite our representations, decide to proceed v/ith the idea ofa Joint Defence Board, as set out in Article 4 of thenew Draft Treaty, we consider that for the reasons givenin paragraph 9 it oould be improved by establishing aJoint Anglo-Egyption Council on a Ministerial level.This Council could., of course, be advised by a joint defence Board on the lines proposed by the foreign secretary n.16,    We must, however, categorically state that this alternative would still fall short of our minimummilitary requirements, and does not provide thenecessary Safeguards for achieving these requirements.(Signed)    ABANBK 0 OKE&quot; CLTMINGHAM OFHYNDHOPE&quot; TEDDERC ab i ne t Off ice,  S.
