SECRETCP. (46)   209 COPY NO. 3 b.25TH MAY,  194oCABINETSupply Position of Wheat and Plour forthe period from the 1st May to the31st October, 1946.Memorandum by the Minister of food.      The supply position of wheat and flour for theperiod to the 31st October has been re-assessed in thelight of the recent discussions in Washington and theresults are set out in Appendix I.    The calculations take into account all economies in wheat &quot;usage and flourconsumption effected to date, details of which are givenin Appendix II.    The figures unfortunately are not firm,and have to be calculated on several alternativeassumptions.    This general atmosphere of uncertainty isone of the major difficulties-in the whole situation.It will be seen from Appendix I that on the most favourablebasis the United Kingdom bulk- stock falls to a lowpoint of 6A8,000 tons at the 31st July, while on the leastfavourable basis it will be reduced statistically to asubstantial minus quantity at the 31st October.    The true position lies somewhere &quot;between these two points but it isimpossible to predict where with any certainty.    Theprincipal element of doubt is the ability of the americans to ship to this country during the period from July to september 194b the following quantities needed to satisfy the most optimistic forecast.(a) 200,000 tons in repayment of the loan.(b) 256,000 tons to make good the Canadianshort-fall.(c) 101,000 tons the balance of the total programme for the United Kingdom up tothe 30th September agreed with the UnitedStates in recent discussions.557,000 tons     Total2.      The Americans recently reaffirmed their undertaking to supply to this country the first two items, but theywere clearly apprehensive about the political criticism whichwould be brought to bear upon them - and indeed upon theUnited Kingdom - at the time,   since to implement their(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

undertaking they would need to devote a substantial part of their total export availability to the satisfaction of the U-.K.  programme.    In any event,  there is still no certainty unfortunntely that sufficient wheat in theearly positions will be available for export from theUnited States to enable the Americans to supply the total quantity required by the United Kingdom without causinggreat hardship to other claimants..    These considerations apply with even greater force to the balance of 101,000 tonsif,  in fact, as seems probable,  the source of supply hasalso to be the United States,    Nor is it certain that even if the total volume of wheat can be produced it canall be physically handled.    The coal strike has already had a delaying effect;    the rail strike may add materiallyto the difficulties and the Gulf export capacity is limited,3.      A further factor making for uncertainty is the netdeficiency of 700,000 tons on the world account remainingat the end of the Washington discussions.    It ispossible,  though not probable,  that additional suppliescan bo made available in the U.S.A.  during the period inquestion to cover the deficit.    But if this hope be notfulfilled it can be dealt with only by a further cut inrequirements and the United Kingdom could hardly escapea further reduction in her import programme:.h.      The estimates of home-grown wheat to be receivedby the flour mills in August and September have beenput by the Ministry of Agriculture at 1+20,000 tons.This is 265,000 tons over the previous estimate for thesetwo months and it is proposed to be achieved by special measures which the Minister of Agriculture is explaining   *in another paper.    I must, of course,  accept the opinionof my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture,  thatthe measures he has in mind will in fact result in this large quantity of wheat being threshed and moved offthe farms in these two months.    I understand, however,that the realisation of this target is dependent on the crop being harvested in a reasonably good condition.    if that assumption is not realised and the condition of the crop when harvested proves to be unsatisfactory, thequantity which could be marketed in those conditions wouldprobably be much less than the 420,000 tons at which mycolleague is aiming.  In any event,  the increase will-not add to our potential supply for 1946/47.    It simplymeans that a part of our resources will bo brought intodistribution earlier ana the supply in later months willbe that much reduced.5.      I must strongly emphasise that even if the most favourable interpretation is put on the statistical outlookup to the 30th September,  this is only a part of the story.We must look forward to the autumn and winter when, as aresult of the freezing of the Great Lakes system and the st. Lawrence,  the main flow of wheat to the easternAtlantic seaboard ceases,     In normal tines substantialstocks are built up on the seaboard before the freeze-upoccurs so  as to take care of shipments until the thawoccurs in the spring.    During the coming winter, however,it is doubtful whether Canada will be in a position to

&apos;build up substantial stocks at the eastern seaboardbecause her stocks of old crop wheat will be extremelylow before the new crop becomes available,  and when&apos;that crop begins to move to the seaboard in Septemberit will be required largely to satisfy currentshipments.    Consequently, when the freese-up occursin late autumn or early winter,  it must be anticipatedthat the stocks available for shipment until the springwill be oil a reduced scale compared with recent seasons,even if the Canadian crop is a good one.    The most recent weather reports and reports on soil conditionsfrom Canada are adverse, and while there is still timefor an improvement it cannot unfortunately be taken for granted that a good yield will be obtained.    The UnitedKingdom is almost entirely de-pendent.upon Canada for supplies and these factors must be kept well in mind,when considering the stock position at the end ofOctober.6.      There has not yet been time adequately to examinethe possibilities of shortening the United Kingdomdistribution pipe-line by taking exceptional measures in regard to the unloading and internal movement of wheat and until this question has been studied by experts,it would be unwise to express an opinion as to the resultBut, as pointed out in paragraph 23 of CP. (ho) 159the reduced flour consumption resulting from the recentmeasures of &quot;economy will automatically permit of some reduction in the bulk stock level of 775,000 tons agreedto recently by the Cabinet as an emergency measure    .*provided that it be understood that the risk of running at this lower level has not diminished.    At the present rate of consumption of 97,500 tons of flour a week atan extraction rate of 90% the bulk stock of wheatrequired on this basis of computation is 700,000 tons.I regard this as the minimum level to which we can gopending the result of the detailed examination which isbeing instituted into the possibility of shortening thepipe-line by exceptional measures involving a greater use of shipping and labour resources.    It should perhaps be added that if the problem were simply to overcome the difficulties of the next 90 days with an assurance of full supplies thereafter there would be some justification tor taking quite exceptional risks.    Butwe are not dealing with a 90 day problem.7.      I should perhaps inform&quot;my colleagues that 1recently arranged for an independent examination ofthe United Kingdom wheat stock level by a personhaving no connection with the Ministry of Pood or withthe food trades.    The report made as a result of thisindependent survey recommended that the minimum UnitedKingdom wheat stock should be maintained at 7^ weeks&apos;usage,  equivalent on the basis of the usage prevailingtoday of&apos;810,000 tons.

8.      It will be seen from the Appendix that even onthe most optimistic assumptions total bulk stocks will fall below this figure at the end of July and august and again in October.    Weighing up all the factors   -I should be disposed to guess that our total shortfall in supplies from the U.S.A. and elsewhere will not beless than,  say,  327,000 tons,  and on this basis our stocks would fall in August to 550,000 tons and inOctober to irLuh.,000 tons - (this Is assumption (d)  inAppendix I..)    These stocks would be below anyconceivable safety minimum even assuming that theenquiry referred to in paragraph 6 is productive ofgood results.9.     With the general uncertainty of the whole position -we must secure full control of the distribution and consumption of flour, bread and other cereal products.With this object in view it is essential to press on with the preparation of a rationing scheme (the only practical means of control)    for promulgation on 21stJuly next, the earliest date by which it can becompleted.    With such a measure in forCe the whole position can be kept under control - without it, anyshort or long-term failure in supplies Would result inthe position getting completely out of hand with veryserious consequences.    I attach as Appendix III a brief outline of the kind of scheme I have in mind.Once introduced it could be used to give effective control at any desired level of consumption dependingupon the supply position.10.    I do not wish to hide from my colleagues theobiectionswhich I see to the introduction of the scheme.It will be distasteful to the public who are looking forrelaxation rather than for further rationing.    It will inevitably impose hardship upon those whose consumptionis above.the average, and result in some loss of productiveefficiency, the measure depending upon the extent of the economy it is necessary to achieve.    Administratively,it will require some 5,000 staff, and will be a most difficult task.    There may well be localised break-downswhich will result in criticism and unrest.    The scheme must incorporate differential rationing and thi3 maylead to a demand for differential rationing of otherfoodstuffs and the surrender of couxjous for meals incatering establishments.11.    These objections are weighty, but what is thealternative if the Americans should fail to make goodtheir promises?    Supplies might have to be cut at the source at short notice.    There would be unevendistribution with runs on flour and the probability of long queues which,  for the first time in our history,might well be hungry queues.    There would be widespreaddisaffection and discontent, and possibly even in some places bread riots.    All this might produce a more dangerous position in the country than we have known forcenturies.    A bread rationing scheme has the advantage

46of equality of treatment, and experience shows that people in this country are prepared,  if necessary,to put up with very serious inconveniences andhardships if they are persuaded that these are sharedequally by the whole community.    Moreover,  a rationing scheme has the great advantage that it can be adaptedat short notice to effect any desired measure of economyby simple adjustments in the coupon values.12.    The uncertainties of the future supply positionand the risks of breakdown are so great that I am driven to the conclusion that it would be the height of follyto carry on as we are at present and to take no remedial action,  in the hope that everything will turn out allright.    If by any chance it does, no harm will have been doneby the completion of the scheme,    I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to the institution of a rationing-scheme for bread,  flour and certain other cereal productson the 21st July next.    In order not to waste time, Ihave already authorised my officers to consult thebakery trade and the Trades Union Congress on thedetails of the scheme in confidence to secure their full co-operation and their help in devising a practicalmeasure,  though   making it clear that no Cabinet decision has yet been reached.    I need eight weeks&apos; noticebefore the scheme can be launched, and if this date is to be adhered to,  the decision must be given onMonday the 27&apos;th May,   though it would be better not *to announce it as the Government&apos;s firm intention tillsome weeks later.13.    No rationing scheme could now produce any economies before the 21st July, but in view of thedecision to lend 73,000 tons of wheat set once to theBritish Zone of Germany it may well be necessary tointroduce further economies to come into force during june.    I am examining the position further and am not asking for an immediate decision, but the choice wouldprobably fall between--(a) raising the extraction rate to 95a -above the level generally accepted as the optimum;(b) adulterating with 10% barley with apossible further cut in beer production;(c) a further reduction in biscuit production.(Intld.)

Interchangeability with ordinary pointsBread coupons would &quot;be exchangeable at the food office withordinary points    coupons either way, probably, at the rate of2 points - one small (14 ozs.) loaf.    This is to enable those whose bread needs are much above average to get more bysurrendering entitlement to other foods and those who needlittle bread to keep off flour consumption and receive compensation.    It provides  just that elasticity which is needed to avoid serious hardship.5.      PrintingIt is hoped that for general use the existing rationbooks can bo utilised and that it would only be necessaryto print extra coupon sheets for adolescents (13 - 18 years)and heavy workers.    Schedules of heavy workers  (when agreed)would need, to bo printed.    Those documents must be ready for distribution 4 weeks before rationing begins.6.      Classification of heavy workers.The Ministry of Labour and National Service are givingmuch help in preparing lists of &quot;heavy workers&quot;, but itwould, be proposed to bring the T.U.C.  into consultation..      Staff.The provisional estimate of staff requirements is4,000 to 5,000 for the preparatory work lasting about twomonths, and thereafter a permanent addition of 2,000 to2,500.-   Most of these would he in the clerical grades.
