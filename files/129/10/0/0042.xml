TTf. 2U2 copy no..?OTH^JUNE f  1 9/.1-6cabinet .output, rfcruitmfnt and conditions of jffplqymfnt&quot;in tnc coalmining industry memorandum.by tlreLord president of the council.     The Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;s paper (C.P.(k6) 232)includes an annex on the present outlook for coal productionand the action proposed to relieve the demand next winter onavailable coal supplies.      The forward position looks very graveindeed.      Fven if the existing labour force were maintained andthe stocks continued to rise at current rates-  the distributedstocks in October next (the seasonal maximum) would reach onl;about 11,000,COO tons compared with 13k millions in October19k5.     Even the 13k&apos;j/b.6 stocks were not sufficient to avoidinterferences with industry and public utilities during thewinter.      The normal seasonal fall would bring stocks down toabout h,000,000 next April on this assumption.      The assumptionis, however,  too optimistic because as the- Minister of Fuel and power points out the return of ex-miners from the Forces will shortly tail off and wastage from the industry will again exceedintake in.. the - absence of further measures.      (At present out ofa gross weekly intake of some 1,500,  approximately 600 areex-miners returning from the Forces.)2.      I suggest,  therefore,  that in addition to the measures proposed by the Minister of Fuel and Power a number of furtherpossibilities should be examined.        I offer the following suggestions *,-(a) that a definite target should be laid down of,  say,2,000 a week gross intake to-the Goal Industry and-   that the achievement of this target should rank asa first priority claim until further notice onsuitable labour.(b) that all unemployed men in coalmining districts(particularly in Development Areas)&quot; should bepersonally interviewed by Ministry of Labourofficers and should be pressed where suitable to anter the coalmining industry.(c) that male labour from Fire recruited by the Ministryof Labour should, so far as practicable, be placedin the coalmining industry during the next sixmonths.  . -(d) that the absorption of Poles into the coalmines inaccordance with existing plans should be pressed on as speedily and extensively as possible,  andthat any.assurances on the five-day week shouldbe conditional on N.U.M.   co-operation in thisrespect.document is the property of HIS britannic majesty&apos;3 government)

-,10 &quot;3. These suggestions are intended to supplement andlinforce the recruitment campaign already &quot;being carried outthe Minister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of Labourend National Service. If all possible steps are not taken,it appears certain that many industries, including buildingraid some- -export industries, will be forced to cut productionand to throw some of their labour into unemployment owing to lack of coal next winter.H.M.Office of the Lord president of the CouncilS-.V7.1.&apos;20TH JUNE ,  1 9b-6.
