(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (hG)^ 2U82 5TH JUNE,  1946FAY!TENT FOR LOSS  OP REMUNERATIVE TIME TO MEMBERS OPBODIES&quot;ESTABLISHED UNDERLIE I1MPTONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. In considering the Report of the Official Committeeon Payment for Loss of Remunerative time to members of bodies established under the National Health Service, mycolleagues will no doubt take note of the reservationmade in paragraph. 17 about the Scottish position.      Since1930, payment has been made, under statute, at a flat rate to members of Scottish County Councils who lose remunerativetime through attendance at meetings of the Council and its committees.      This system is simpler in operation thanthe payment, within a prescribed?maximum,  of the actualwages lost, which may involve detailed verification on each occasion.      If, as a result  of the inquiry which isnow being instituted by the Minister of Health and myselfinto the whole question of the payment of the expenses oflocal councillors, the present Scottish system is retained,and perhaps extended to other types of authority, I seedifficulty in applying a different basis of compensation to the members of National Health Service Bodies, many ofwhom will also be members of local authorities.2. The only point of immediate urgency is to include in the National Health Service Bills a provision enablingpayment to be made for a loss of remunerative time, thebasis of payment being left for later settlement by regulation.      I therefore suggest that,  so far at any rate as Scotland is concerned, we should at the moment merelydecide upon the inclusion of such a provision, leaving thebasis of compensation to be settled when the future positionof local authority members lias been considered.(Intld.)
