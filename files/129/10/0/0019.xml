THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 219.5th June, 1946.CABINET.REVISION OF ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE my last report to the Cabinet on the 27th May I have had theopportunity of personal consultation with Lord Stansgate in regard to theposition which has been reached in the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. this position is, briefly, that the Egyptian Delegation have refused (and I am assured that the refusal is final) to embody in a new treaty, or in any published treatyinstrument, (a) clauses similar to those of the 1936 treaty which promised thiscountry, in the case of war or international emergency, all facilities which Egyptcould offer, &quot; including the use of ports, aerodromes and means of communica-tion &quot; and the right, after consultation, to send in troops, (b) certain new provisions which we desired about the maintenance of installations and facilities in peace-time. The attitude of the Egyptian Delegation is, however, that weshall obtain the substance of what we require through the medium of staff conversations and agreements between the military authorities of the twocountries. Such agreements would not, however, be published and they would notbe binding on the Egyptian State, i.e., a future Government could refuse to implement them.2. At first it appears that we have reached a complete deadlock, and thatthe Egyptians are offering us no real possibility of filling the vacuum which Ihave pledged His Majesty&apos;s Government not to allow after the withdrawal ofour troops. It has, however, been represented to me that in actual practice the implementation of any defence scheme maintained in peace-time&quot;- on egytian territory and by Egyptian personnel depends on the goodwill of the egyptian government and the Egyptian people, and that this holds good whateverprovisions may, or may not, figure in our treaty arrangements, published orunpublished. Thus, even if the provisions of the 1936 treaty were textaallyreproduced in the new treaty, an unfriendly Egyptian Government could, in anemergency, sabotage them without great difficulty. For instance, even under the1936 treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government were not the sole judges of the existenceof an emergency. There was to be consultation as provided for in the agreedminute which forms part of the treaty. It would be open, therefore, to a hostileEgyptian Government to refuse to admit that an emergency had come into&quot;existence. Contrariwise, a friendly Government might give us (as in 1940-44)far more extensive facilities than were ever defined in writing. In any event itis useless to have facilities for the re-entry of troops if there are no adequateinstallations available for them, and there was nothing in the 1936 treaty toprovide for this. From a practical point of view the maintenance of installations,&amp;c, is more important than a treat)^ right of re-entry after consultation. Theonly method by which we can secure the maintenance of these installations isthrough arrangements between the two military staffs carried out by a friendlyEgyptian Government.3. This being so, I have endeavoured so to readapt certain jjrovisions of anew draft treaty, to which Sidky Pasha personally (though so far not theEgyptian Delegation) has given his assent, as to replace, in a manner acceptable to Egyptian opinion, the (in Egyptian eyes) inadmissible provisions of the 1936treaty. The result is contained in articles 4, 5 and 6 of the annexed draft treaty(Annex I) which are intended to provide, through the mechanism of arrangements between the two staffs, for the necessary action in time of emergency including[31942] b
the maintenance of the installations and facilities required for use in an emer-gency. My colleagues will observe that I have adopted the device of a joint defence Board (on the analogy of the United States-Canada Defence Boardformed in 1940), the function of which will be &quot;to keep under review the inter-national situation and to consult with a view to advising and recommendingappropriate action to the two Governments upon all events which may threaten the security&quot; of the Middle East or the vital interests of the two countries, andthus, in fact if not in name, plan the facilities, &amp;e, granted to us in war oremergency by the old treaty. I would refer my colleagues in this connexionto Sir R. Campbells telegram No. 1009, a copy of which is annexed (Annex III)which indicates that support for the idea of a Joint Board will be forthcoming from the King of Egypt. The evacuation protocol (Annex II -see Articles iii and IV) provides for the co-ordination of the evacuation with the plans for thefuture drawn up by the British and Egyptian military staffs. This is my proposal for filling the vacuum.4. In my view, it is unnecessary to insist that the military staff arrangements which are foreseen by these three articles (notably Article 6) should be completebefore the treaty is signed. The treaty only becomes operative on ratification,and inevitably an interval of at least three months must elapse between signatureand ratification. The discussions between the two military staffs can continue in this interval, and progress can be assessed. Consequently we shall, if necessary,have in connexion with the ratification of the treaty, a further opportunity of using influence with the Egyptian Government to carry out the scheme by sayingthat we are unable to ratify unless the Egyptians show that they are in factready to do so.5. After ratification, we should, as I have already said, still be dependenton the loyal fulfilment by Egypt of her obligations under the proposed treaty.This would have been just as much the case if the treaty had contained an elaborate military convention. In both cases it would be open to us, if Egyptis not carrying out her obligations, either (a) to change our military plans and arrange for our bases to be elsewhere, e.g., Cyrenaica, or (6) if we thought fit,express our disquietude to the Security Council about the unsatisfactory positionof the Middle East as regards defence and try and arrange for the security council to make alternative demands on Egypt by way of a security agreement under Article 43 of the Charter. In any case, we should be on far better ground in going to the Security Council as suggested after Egypt had failed to fulfilher obligations under a new treaty which she has freely accepted after the charter had come into force than we would be if we went to the Security Councilnow on the ground that Egypt had failed to conclude a new Treaty of Alliance,on terms which we considered suitable, namely a treaty containing elaboratewritten terms because we could not believe in Egypt&apos;s good faith.6. For the rest I would point out that the proposed treaty only abrogatesthe corresponding articles of the 1936 treaty, which are appended in Annex I,and leaves the Sudan article untouched, as the Egyptians have stated that they wish to deal with the Sudan in a separate protocol, a course which is desirablefrom our point of view also. It is of course understood that the financial implications-tions of the proposed treaty arrangements (which are under examination in Cairo)will require further consideration. Some idea of the problems arising in this connexion is given in the note which appears in the draft evacuation protocolas Article IV. But I would make it clear that we have never had to incurexpenditure in regard to the provision of accommodation for our forces which,but for the war, we should have incurred under the 1936 treaty. If we regardEgypt as a vital Imperial connexion, we must be prepared now to pay forinstallations, communications and other facilities. Our negotiators must beempowered to negotiate in the last resort a generous financial settlement, thoughnaturally they would secure the best financial terms they can.7. If the Cabinet approve, I would authorise His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Cairo to explain to Sidky Pasha our proposals on the lines of paragraph above and enquire whether it is worth while for Lord Stansgate to return to cairo to continue the negotiations on that basis, which represents a very greatconcession to the point of view expressed by the Egyptian Delegation.Foreign Office, 5th June 1946.E.

Further, in providing for consultation Iand the recommendation of action in the case pof international emergency, it provides for a 1procedure which gives exactly the substance Iof paragraph 2 of Article 7 of the Treaty of I1936, since under the Treaty of  1936 there was, strictly speaking, to be consultation on pthe question of imminent menace of war and faapprehended international emergency (vide (ii) gof the agreed minute).

ANNEX II.Draft Protocol relating to the Withdrawal of the British Forces from egypt.THE Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland and the Egyptian Government:Having regard to abrogation by the Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed this day of the Treaty signed in London on the 26th August, 1936, which provided forthe stationing in Egyptian territory of certain British forces : and desiring to settle by agreement the arrangements for the withdrawal from egypt of the British forces which are at present there and for the removal, ordisposal, of the large installations, stores of material and equipment, and com-munications facilities, which those forces have made or accumulated in Egypt asa result of the war 1939-45 : andFurther considering that these arrangements should be such as to provide that the withdrawal of the forces should take place as soon as possible, and tosecure that both this withdrawal and the removal and disposal of the material,equipment and facilities should be co-ordinated with the arrangements agreed between the competent military authorities of the two Governments in accordancewith Article 6 of the Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed this day having in view the continued security of the Middle East, including all territories adjacent to egypt:Have agreed as follows :-Article I.(i) Not later than .... from the date of the entry into force of theTreaty of Mutual Assistance signed this day &apos;(a) all British forces shall be withdrawn from the cities of Cairo and alexandria, and from the Nile Delta;(b) the total number of British forces in Egypt shall be reduced and certainfield formations of the Army and certain operational and training units of the E.A.F. shall be withdrawn from Egypt;(c) all Naval  forces shall be withdrawn  from  Egypt except  a small number of personnel, directly concerned with the withdrawal ofthe military and air forces referred to in Article I of the Protocol.Article II.Not later than . . . . from the date of entry into force of the Treatyof Mutual Assistance signed this day, all combatant troops of the Army and alloperational and training units of the R.A.F. shall be withdrawn from Egypt andno British military, air force or naval personnel will be retained in Egypt otherthan those required during the period covered by Article III for the operation and removal of the installations, stores of material and equipment and com-munication facilities made or accumulated in Egypt by the British forces during their presence in Egypt.Article III.The installations, stores of material and equipment and the communicationfacilities made or accumulated by the British forces in Egypt slhall be removedor disposed of, or be placed at the disposal of the Egyptian forces, in accordancewith plans which shall be drawn up and agreed by the Staffs of the British and egyptian forces. These plans shall be such as to co-ordinate, in the interestof the continued security of the Middle East including all territories adjacent to Egypt, the removal and disposal of the installations, stores of material andequipment and communication facilities with the arrangements agreed betweenthe competent military authorities of the twro Governments in accordance with article 6 of the Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed this day. The British naval,military or air force personnel retained under Article II of this Protocol, inconnexion with the installations, stores and facilities to be removed or disposedof, or placed at the disposal of the Egyptian forces, shall be withdrawn from egypt as each installation, store and facility is removed or disposed of in accor-dance with this plan.[319421 d
Article IV.Note.[A.rticle III above provides for the removal or disposal of installationsstores and material and of communication facilities in accordance with plans to be drawn up and agreed between the British and Egyptian military staffs.The idea is that these plans should provide : (1) for certain installations to be maintained in Egypt by the Egyptians for joint use in time of emergency. Some of the installations to be somaintained exist now and others have to be constructed. We shouldbe willing to construct these and to pay a generous share of the cost.(2) that certain stores of material and equipment shall be guarded in Egyptby the Egyptians for use by the British forces if, in time of emergency,they return to Egypt. These stores of material and equipment toremain the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptiansto employ some British technical personnel as their servants for thepurpose of helping the Egyptians to look after them and also of teaching the Egyptians.(3) that the Egyptians should purchase some material and equipment andpossibly some installations of ours for the exclusive use of their own forces.It will consequently be necessary to have a financial provision either here orin some annexed letter dealing with the payment by the Egyptians for the stores and equipment and installations which they purchase for their own use. Anotherquestion is what the Egyptians should pay for installations left in Egypt for joint use.Everything which the British forces leave in Egypt will be handed overto the Egyptian Government either for their sole use or for maintenance for joint use or for guarding for British use according to the category in whichthey fall.It will be seen that nearly all these detailed arrangements must be leftto be settled by the plans of the two military staffs and they cannot appeareither in the Treaty or in the Evacuation Protocol. It may be possible, however,to insert something here about handing over to the Egyptian Governmentinstallations, &apos;&amp;o, which are left.]Article V.The provisions of the convention relating to Immunities and Privilegessigned on the 26th August, 1936, will continue to apply to the British forcesuntil their withdrawal is complete in accordance with the provisions of thepresent Protocol.Article VI.This Protocol shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification exchangedat the same time as those relating to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed this day.This Protocol shall be regarded as an integral part of the Treaty of mutual assistance.In witness whereof :ANNEX III.Sir R. I. Campbell to Mr. Bevin. [Received 2nd June.)(No. 1009.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, 2nd June, 1946.YOUR telegram No. 782 instructed us to try to secure some benefits of theJoint Defence Board on the lines of the United States-Canadian arrangement.Egyptian negotiators rejected this out of a ludicrous fear engendered by themisapprehension of the words &quot;on a Ministerial level&quot; fear which preventedthem from reading the next words saying the Board would &quot;meet from time to
time.&quot; This ridiculous incident is a revealing example of the depth of morbid-ness to which the Egyptians have been plunged by their state of raw-nervedsensibility a state of which we have perforce to take account as a genuine factor in the situation.Misapprehension has, however, been removed by our explanation and when we mentioned it recently to King Farouk he seemed to like the idea of a joint board. At our last audience His Majesty spontaneously referred to it as some-thing which might meet the difficulty over action in an emergency (and facilities)and recommended that we should study its possibilities. He did not think thatthe Egyptian delegation ought to feel unable to accept something on these lines.He suggested a mention of it in the treaty provisions themselves.Since then Hassan Youssef Bey, in private conversation with a member of the embassy staff, has twice referred to the United States-Canadian Board. TheMinister for Foreign Affairs showed considerable interest in the arrangement between Canada and the United States concerning Alaska highway when LordStansgate mentioned it to him on the 1st June.2. Though doubtless His Majesty&apos;s Government suggested a Joint Boardchiefly as a piece of mechanism to give staff contacts proposed by Egyptians anelementary concreteness and permanency, I wonder whether we could not nowextend scope of suggestion and use it in conjunction with Article 5 of avant-projetto get round present impasse and at the same time actually to secure our requirements.3. It seems possible that a Joint Board system if mentioned in Article 5as a means of filling out provision of that article might both ensure for us thenecessary facilities and even render possible requisite action in emergency period.This might be more possible if it were combined with understanding aboutdisposition of Egyptian and British forces in case of Egyptian military actionin limitrophe countries (Foreign Office telegram No. 1077).4. Joint Board would then constitute a method both of consultation andof action.5.   Question of what happens in case of disagreement on the Board remains.Presumably, disagreements would go to heads of the two Governments.(King Farouk toyed with the idea that heads of the Board might be the two headsof State as being Commanders-in-Chief of forces so that the matter might bedealt with on military as distinct from political basis. But this is doubtlessimpossible constitutionally.)If there was [ ? dispute] at this level could His Majesty&apos;s Government con-template reference to an umpire satisfactory to both parties ?If so, would the President of the United States, King Ibn Saud or arab league be expedient?6. Sidki Pasha has said he thinks he could get the Egyptian delegation to accept Article 5 of avant-projet.King Farouk has said the same and acting head of Royal Cabinet has saidthat His Majesty would be able and ready to force acceptance of Article 5 inconjunction with a Joint Board system to which reference would be made onthat account.   Joint Board would be in substitution for a military convention.7. His Majesty would, of course, be encouraged and helped in such action if we gave definite and really early dates for withdrawal of HQ. and all troops from the cities and of combatant troops from the delta and the rest of Egypt.I am sure that we should in any case determine to overcome all practical andfinancial difficulties in the way of rapid withdrawal from the cities, &amp;c, and early communication of dates to the Egyptian Government.8. I believe we must face the fact that the Egyptians will not accept aspart of treaty or close tie up with it a military convention or similar documentof detailed and comprehensive character we put forward.9. I do not know how far ideas put forward above are acceptable as Iam still without text of United States-Canadian Joint Defence Board arrange-ment or any comments upon it. I hope we may be sent early information since in case there is anything in the idea it seems a pity not to be able to utiliseinterest shown on Egyptian side.10. Above is subject to concurrence of Lord Stansgate, to whom it maybe useful as bringing together the ideas we have discussed.
