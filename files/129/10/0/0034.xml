THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 234.I 17/A June, 1946.CABINET.CONTROL OF SUBORDINATE LEGISLATION  BY  THELEGISLATION COMMITTEE.Note by the Prime Minister.THE Legislation Committee now examine in draft all Bills and all orders in Council made under emergency and transitional legislation (e.g., the supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945). It is desirable (c/. H.P.C. (46)49) that the scope of the Committee&apos;s work should be widened to include the scrutiny of at least some of the statutory instruments made under legislationother than emergency and transitional legislation; and I have agreed that its terms of reference should be amended to read as follows :  &quot; To keep the Governments legislative programme under review and toundertake a detailed examination of all draft Bills and of such statutory instruments in respect of which proceedings may be taken in Parliament asmay be referred to it.&quot;2. These terms of reference leave it to tlhe Minister concerned to decide whether a particular statutory instrument should be submitted to the legislation committee. In exercising this discretion Ministers should keep it in mind thatthe Committee ought to have an opportunity of examining : (a) all Orders in Council under emergency and transitional legislation;(b) all statutory instruments likely to affect a large number of Departmentswhose interests cannot conveniently be ascertained by directconsultation;(c) all statutory instruments likely to give risa to criticism from the SelectCommittee on Statutory Rules and Orders;
(d) all statutory instruments involving any departure from precedent (e.g.tin the type of penalties proposed, in the procedura regulating suchmatters as appeals, or in encroachments on the liberty of the subject),This list is not exhaustive and may be enlarged in the light of further experience.Meanwhile, the bias should be in favour of submitting to the Committee any statutory instrument in respect of which the Minister feels any doubt.The primary task of the Committee will be to examine the form of thestatutory instruments submitted to them and to consider whether they raisepoints of general concern. Any major question of policy connected with a statutory instrument should be submitted to the appropriate policy Committesor to the Cabinet itself.3. The increasing use of subordinate legislation to enact provisions whichin the past would have been included in statutes makes it specially important that Ministsrs should keep their colleagues informed of their use of this procedure,in order that the collective responsibility of Ministers for all Government legisla-tion may be safeguarded. I trust, therefore, that all Ministers will look on itas their personal responsibility to ensure that in all appropriate cases the advice of their colleagues is obtained through the Legislation Committee. In particular,each Minister should see that the officials within his Department are alive to theneed to bring to his notice all statutory instruments, and to draw his attentionto any feature in them which may concsrn other Departments, either directly or because of the precedent that it may set, or which might give rise to criticismby the public or in the Press or to opposition in Parliament.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,11th June, 1946.
