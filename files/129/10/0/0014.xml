(46) 214.30th May, 1946.Copy No.CABINET.PROSPECTS OF DRY-CARGO SHIPPING TONNAGE FOR 1946.Memorandum by Minister of Transport.IN my Memorandum CP. (46) 36 of the 31st January, 1946, I set out for theinformation of my colleagues the prospects of dry-cargo shipping for 1946.They may like to have now an appreciation of the probable position in the last half of the year.Imports in the First Site Months of 1946.2. Cargo availability has been less than was hoped, and the latest estimateof United Kingdom imports in the first six months is -.&apos; Million tons.Food ...      ...      5-5     (excluding diversions to the Continent)Materials ...      8-miscellaneous ...      0-3Total13-8     (averaging 2-3 million tons monthly)Our Tonnage Resources for the Second Half of 1946.3. Since I last reported on the position, the Congress of the United states has passed the measure relating to American shipping and did not insert any powers enabling surplus American ships to be chartered to foreigners on bare-boatterms. Nevertheless, I have assumed that we shall continue for the time being toretain 2f million d.w. tons of United States shipping now on bare-boat charter to us under emergency arrangements, in addition to rather over 1 million d.w tonsof Canadian ships, on bare-boat terms, under the arrangements negotiated last autumn with the Canadian Government which assured these Canadian ships tous for the next two or three years. I also assume that much of the balance of theCanadian-owned tonnage will continue to be employed in trades which directly or indirectly relieve us of liabilities.4. My figures allow for the increase in our resources by new construction.On the other hand, I have made no allowance for the possible purchase of american ships, which are now being offered for sale under the terms of therecent legislation. British owners have been authorised to bid for about 40(say 400,000 d.w. tons) of the better types specially suitable for use in our linertrades while our building is in progress. These are not likely to be deliveredbefore September.5. There may be a small loss of tonnage by sale of old and uneconomicalships to foreign buyers. This is a necessary feature of the rehabilitation of ourmerchant fleet. For the time being I am forced by our need for tonnage tocontinue to limit such transactions more than may be wise in the long run; butwe must let some ships go. The loss of tonnage on this account is, however, not of sufficient magnitude to affect the balance-sheet.Demands upon Shipping in the Second Six Months of 1946.6. In my last memorandum I indicated that the requirements of the food and Supply Ministries were aimed at a total United Kingdom import programme for the year of 35 million tons, as compared with an import of 25^ million tons in1945.  It is already clear that supplies are not available on this scale, quite apart[31912]
from any questions of shipping. With imports of less than 14 million tons inthe first half-year, over 21 million tons would be needed in the second half-yearto satisfy the requirements as originally stated. Supplies are not available toprovide even as much as 19 million tons in the second half-year, and it wouldnot be altogether unexpected if in the outcome the imports in the second half-year were less than 17 million tons, giving a total for the year of less than31 million tons.The Departmental requirement programmes for imports into this countryin the second half of 1946 are as follows : Million tons.Food        .........      .......        6-5Materials.........       ...       ...       12-miscellaneous     ...      ...      ... &quot; ;;Total    ...      ...      ...      ....      18-8 (averaging over  million tons monthly)Of this total, upwards of 30 per cent, is programmed from North America,and about 25 per cent, from N.-W. Europe.If additional supplies of goods could be made available in the Indian Oceansareas and in the Far East, they could, in present circumstances, be brought to thiscountry at a relatively low tonnage cost, since in doing so certain reductions in ballast movements could be effected.7. The requirements of the Allied Control Commission in Germany, andCereals for India and South Africa, amount to 1^ and just Over 2 million tonsof cargo respectively, on the assumption that sufficient cereals will be available.Coal programmes, apart from exports from the United Kingdom toN.-W. Europe, amount to about 4 million tons, including shipments forU.N.R.R.A. Of this 4 million only 800,000 tons is from the United Kingdomand the rest is shipped from India or South Africa and other sources.8. Military maintenance is estimated to require the equivalent of 11 sailingsa month from the United Kingdom, 2 to 3 sailings a month from the UnitedStates and about 7 sailings a month on other routes. These &apos;&apos; sailings &apos;&apos; represent only some 50 per cent, of those required in the first half of the year.Other tonnage required for Naval and Military purposes throughout thesecond half of 1946 averages 2-0 million d.w. tons, as compared with 4-4 actuallyengaged oh these services as at the beginning of the year. Troopships and othertonnage wholly on Naval and Military service will decrease from 2-2 to 1-45million d.w. tons, and tonnage for Military shipments in the Mediterranean,Indian Ocean and Far East, and to N.-W. Europe, from 2-2 to 0-55 million d.w.tons.9. The import programmes of the Dominions and Colonies (apart from coal,cereals and exports from United Kingdom) include about 1\ million tons from theUnited States, which is costly in tonnage and represent an increase of about 7 percent, over the latest programme for the first half-year.10. No specific allowance has been made for help by our tonnage toU.N.R.R.A. or to other European programmes (apart from the items in para-graph 7 above), but some assistance is being given and must continue to be given in short-sea tonnage, in internal movements in the Mediterranean and in other tradesas we are able. It is obviously important on shipping and other grounds that weshould continue to give such assistance. For the purpose of the balance-sheet,however, these, and other miscellaneous demands, may, so long as they remain at about their present level, be regarded as offset by chartering of foreign tonnage for Dominion requirements, which is likewise not specifically allowed for.Conclusion.11. The balance sheet indicates a deficit of 1-7 million d.w. tons; that is tosay, the programmes and responsibilities taken into account would, as a whole,require the continuous use of 1-7 million d.w. tons more shipping than we arelikely to have available, apart from foreign help. The continuance of the linersailings of United States ships to the United Kingdom on the current basis would,however, cover 0-3 million d.w. tons of this deficiency, and continuance of thepresent level of charterings of European tonnage would cover a further 0 - 3 milliond.w. tons.
It will be seen that unless, on the ground of non-availability of supplies, someof the programmes fall below the figures indicated to me, we shall still need tocover a gap of over 1 million d.w. tons during the rest of the year, which we could do either by increasing our chartering of European tonnage, or by continuing totake additional ships on voyage charter from the United States. Current indi-cations are that for the next month or two we shall need very little additionaltonnage to cover this gap. The explanation is to be found in the fact that goods are not yet becoming available in the quantities envisaged in the statements of requirements to which reference is made in paragraphs 6 and 7 above.A.B.Ministry of Transport, W.l.30th May, 1946.APPENDIX.Balance Sheet for British Ocean-going Dry-Cargo Shipping(1,600 g.t. and over) in the second half of 1946.(Million d.w. tons.)Tonnage   available   (including   2-75   m.d.w.t.   and1 -1 m.d.w.t. on bare-boat charter to the UnitedKingdom from United States and Canada respec-tively.
