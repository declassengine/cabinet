I CmcuurED.ag.;g;ttV&quot;&quot;At ^.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted by the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET. Copy No,   3CP. (46) 212.25th May, 1946,CABINET.EIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affatrs.I think my colleagues will like to read the annexed copy of a note bySir John Maffey. the United Kingdom Representative in Dublin, of an interviewwhich he had with Mr. de Valera on the 18th May.A.Dominions Office, S.W.1,25th May, 1946.ANNEX.MEMORANDUM OF INTERVIEW WITH Mr. DE VALERA on saturday, 18th MAY.Mr. de Valera asked to see me this morning and I was with him for an hour and a half. He looks thin and worn and his health seems to havedeteriorated in recent months. His manner was very friendly and though our conversation was, as usual, very frank, there was no electricity in the air.His object in asking to see me was to make sure that I appreciated the&quot;tragic difficulty&quot; in which he and his Government are placed by having totake firm administrative action against men who are moved to violence andmartyrdom by their strong resentment against Partition.First, however, with genuine sincerity he said that he wished to express hiswarm congratulations to me as United Kingdom Representative on the courageousaction of my Government in their generous offer to India. He had no doubt thatwe should reap great benefits from Indian goodwill. In thanking him I saidthat I felt sure that the line we were following offered the best hope, but that Iwas genuinely concerned lest the situation should develop into a bitter communalconflict between the Hindus and Mohammedans. He said that in his view this consideration should not deter us.   We could not be held responsible.The death of McCaughey, the I.R.A. hunger striker, in Maryborough Jail andthe likelihood of a similar end for Fleming in Belfast have considerable signifi-cance here. In Ireland, administration is swayed by politics. Politics areswayed by emotions and emotions are swayed by hysteria. Thus on the one sideyou have the simple practical administrative principle that no Government cantolerate direct interference with its own conduct of policy and must crush therebel ruthlessly. On the other side you have the crowds and marchings and bandsand Requiem Masses which summon Irish men and women to active symapathy for one more Irish patriot, one who has died because the Union Jack still fliesin Ulster. All this inferentially condemns the de Valera Government for itsapparent acceptance of this finai wrong to Ireland. There is dangerous incite-ment in this for an indoctrinated and frustrated generation of Irishmen.On the administrative side of this problem, which was the easy one for me,I said that clearly there was no alternative since no Government could bestampeded by law-breakers on hunger strike. I felt that the firm line taken inthe case of McCaughey would deter others from following his example and thatin this way hunger striking would cease to be a problem. I said that it seemedto me that patriotism in the case of many of these men is nothing more than acloak to cover the gangster and the anarchist.[31886]
Mr. de Valera made two good comments. Firstly, that strict censorshipdhring the war had had a powerful effect in keeping would-be &apos;&apos; martyrs &apos;&apos; incheck. Now that publicity was again available he feared there would undoubtedly be successors to McCaughey. Secondly, he said that the only reason that he and his Cabinet, mostly men who had been out in 1916, could deal firmlywith a problem of this kind was because of their own record of active service to their country. Nevertheless, it created great difficulty for them since they,too, detested Partition.Here we plunged into the long tale of lost opportunities, of what he had worked for in 1921, of how more recently Mr. Neville Chamberlain had evidentlybeen anxious to end Partition and described it as an anachronism. I said thatthe war had come too early for any developments on these lines. The war had altered the whole picture. Mr. de Valera agreed that this was so and recurredto the opportunities lost when Mr. Lloyd George had the chance to grasp them.He (Mr. de Valera) had at that time always assumed the necessity of a defensivealliance with England and would have been well disposed to a dual monarchy.Much that could have happened at that date was now completely out of the picture owing to the march of time.o The friction now engendered by Partitionwas impeding even such co-operation as was possible and necessary to-day. Therewere contacts which might be made now, but there was no denying the difficulties.(This may have been a reference to the impending Commonwealth TradeConference.)He said that, if he were to-day a young man in Northern Ireland, he feltthat he would be giving his life to fight the existing order of things. I askedwhether now, as an older man, he felt that such a course would be wise. To meit seemed likely to do far more harm than good. If Partition ended, it would end because it was natural for it to end, because the majority of people desiredit to end. Partition did not rest on British bayonets and British subsidies as was incorrectly believed in many quarters here. It was idle to suppose that any british Government could take action to influence the majority in the North togo against its own wishes. He ought to be the last to wish the British Govern-ment to take a line against the North. Any such action would lead to a violentpolitical outbreak and in my opinion the result of that would be to rally immensesympathy all over the world to the North. It was all very well to talk of thepower of Irish-American isolationists in promoting anti-British policies, butthere would soon be another side to that picture if the Presbyterian Northbecame vocal in America and the Commonwealth. Nor would the Americanbe deaf to the argument that Northern Ireland have provided their Forces withsafe harbours and safe bases in the war. I could see his difficulties and couldenter into his feelings. But the strong Republican move of the Twenty-six counties by creating such a different picture from that envisaged by BritishLiberal opinion in the old Home Rule Bill and, indeed, by creating such adifferent position from that defined in the Treaty of 1921, had introduced new factors which, coupled with neutrality, made Partition a far more stubborn.and intractable problem than it might have been if events had followed anothercourse. He himself had stated publicly more than once that he ruled out force as being a solvent of the problem. Agitation was likely to lead to force. I wasdisturbed by the way in which the Partition question was used on politicalplatforms. I could assure him that personally I could see many arguments forthe unity of Ireland. I thought that unity might come and that it would comeall the sooner by being left to the peaceful working out of natural factors andby the closer contacts between our two islands which time and patience wouldmake possible.The preceding does not call for any particular comment. Mr. de Valerasaid that he was very glad to have had this talk with me. It certainly seemsto do him good to give vent to his feelings. It is to be hoped that the&quot; martyrdom &quot; tactics do not catch on. Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government have beensane and sound on this issue up to date. But the blood-sacrifice tradition inIreland is strong. I can understand Mr. de Valera&apos;s anxieties. On thebiographical note I asked him whether he regretted that the Home Rule bill had not been implemented in 1913, whether he felt, in fact, that this measure would have been inadequate to satisfy his ideas of a free Ireland. He saidthat it was not easy to work back over the &quot; ifs &quot; of his life, but that if theHome Rule Bill had been passed, he personally would never have been in politicsat all. He would have remained a teacher. What had moved him to action wasGarson&apos;s flaming defiance of the British Government and the unhampered armingof the North against this measure of Irish freedom. That was the clue to allthat followed.
