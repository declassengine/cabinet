DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S E ORE TCP. (46)   215 COPY NO.  j g3QTH MAY.  19U6CabinetGREECEMemorandum &quot;by. the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs at their meeting on the 27th March,  the Defence Commit teeagreed:-(a) that British troops must he withdrawn from Greeceat the earliest possible moment;(b) that for the present the Greek Army should bemaintained at a strength of 100,000; it being understood that the question would be reviewed again after the Greek elections.The elections have now been held and a new GreekGovernment has been formed .    It is therefore necessary to reconsider the position of the British troops in Greece and ofthe Greek forces.    There are two matters for settlement1.    What conditions must&apos;be fulfilled before Britishtroops can be withdrawn;  can any provisionaldate be fixed for withdrawal?2.    What should be the strength of the Greek armed forces and what financial arrangements must bemade for their equipment and maintenance?2,        The fundamental assumptions of our policy have been dee it with in previous papers.3.        For the maintenance of a stabilised position in. Greece itis essential that there be agreement with Russia.    This involves the. withdrawal of Russian troops from South and East Europe andthe withdrawal of our troops from Greece.    In this connexion wemust obtain the support of the Dominions and the United States.4.        If there were premature withdrawal a grave danger would arise that Greece would not be able to maintain her integrityagainst possible attacks by the neighbouring satellite powers,while U.N.O.  is not yet sufficiently well established for completereliance to&apos; be placed in its ability to safeguard Greekindependence.

9.       My conclusions are:-(1)    That we must make every effort to obtain thewithdrawal of Russian forces from South East Europe as soon,as possible after the peace treaties have been signed and thaiwe should try to obtain the full support of the Dominions and united States Governments over this.(2)    That it would be unwise to commit ourselves towithdrawing British forces from Greece until the Internationa:situation is clearer and at least until we know what we can obtain about the withdrawal of Russian troops from South EasstEurope, and until the Greek Army is strong enough to defend  ifrontiers against Yugoslav and Bulgarian aggression.(3)    We should consider what financial obligation weare prepared to enter into to maintain the larger Greek Armyso as to make it possible to withdraw our A&quot;rmy at the end ofthe summer.(Intld)    E.B.Foreign Office, S.W. 130TH MAY, 1 9*4-6.5.        I do not anticipate a direct Russian attack on Greece,out I cannot put out of ray mind the possibility of encourage-rnent being given by Russia tc those other powers to createtrouble with. Greece, particularly in respect of the questionof Macedonia and Galonion as well as with Turkey over Thrace,These difficulties will not arise as long as British troops are in Greece.6,       We have encouraged the Greek Government to build their army up to its present ceiling figure of 100,000, but theyclearly cannot afford by themselves to maintain so large anArray.    The economy of Greece certainly cannot for a considerable time stand the strain of maintaining an Army of more than50,000 but I take the view that until stability is achieved in the Balkans the Greek Army ought not to he reduced to thelower figure.    In any case, provided that the British Serviceand Police Missions remain,  the larger figure would providea reasonable prospect of the Greek Array being adequate forthe defence of Greek independence once the peace&quot;, treaties with Roumania and Bulgaria,  have been concluded and Russian,troops withdrawn from S.E.  Europe.7.        There is nothing much His Majesty&apos;s Government can do to protect Greece from the effect of printing paper money in &apos;order to cover the internal cost of the Greek Armed Forces.It would be of no use to cover this expenditure in sterlingsince the danger of collapse arises not from the shortage of sterling, but from -printing too much paper money in Greeceitself.8.        The maintenance of an Army of 100,000 also involvesan expenditure in sterling of more than  115,000,000 a year.So long as British troops are in Greece this can be partlymet out of the sterling due to the Greek Government in respectof the Greek currency supplied for the local needs of british forces.    This however is only a temporary alleviation.    Inthe long run.,  if Greece maintains an Army of 100,000, a large   i4part of the external cost will fall on His Majesty&apos;s Government.The amount of money available for military expenditure bythis country is limited, and the question is whether better-value is obtained, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned,hy spending over  15,000,000 a year on the Greek Array, or byspending the same amount on British Forces in other parts ofthe world.
