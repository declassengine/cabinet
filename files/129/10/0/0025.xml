The conditions limiting dietoncer, classes of goods and persons for whom the E licensee can carry apply only in relationto carriage for hire or reward.     One operator may have severalconditions attached, to his licence (e.g. general goods 5 miles,livestock 50 miles,  goods for a named, individual 100 miles).In 1338,  there were some 60,000 conditions attached to 3 licencesdetermining the distances for which the holders, could carry goods for hire or reward, and some 17,000 condition.&apos;- of other kinds (e.g.Limiting the operator to goods for specified perrons;    goods tospecified destinations,  etc.) .     The a ones of operation allowed,under the conditions relating to distance were;-Not exceeding&apos;10 miles ApproximatelyExceeding 10 miles hot notexceeding 20 miles ;iExceeding 20 miles but notexceeding 30 miles                       . &quot;Exceeding 30 miles but notexceeding 50 miles &quot;Exceeding 50 miles &quot;23 per ceim.29 i; ;I20    &quot;        ;t16123.     The Ilinister of Transport &apos;s proposal is briefly that theC licence should author!oe the holder to operate his vehicleswithin a radius of ho miles from the base at which they are normally kept.      Beyond that radius the onus would be on theapplicant to  justify to the Licensing Authority the case for usingprivate as distinct from public transport.        But the Bill wouldrequire the Licensing Authority to have regard to the followingamong other relevant considerations:-(i) The extent to which it is necessary for the applicantto employ his own vehicles for the purpose ofconnecting two or more plants or depots to maintain      Aa continuous process of production;-(ii) The effect on the trade or business of the applicant,including the extent 00 which additional costs inpacking, handling and. breakages- aro likely to be incurred,  if the permit is withheld;(iii) Any representations made by the British transport commission, particularly as to the extent to which,and. the circumstances in which, the applicant callson the Corralssion to carrjr any of Lie traffic.h.      It has been suggested that the Government&apos; s policy on the location of industry may in some cases require a liberalinterpretation of the proposed long distance limitation and thatcertain firms may not be satisfied, with the direction to the licensing Authority contained in paragraph 3(i)  of this Report.The Ministerial Gooiiittee reoouimend that the Bill should contain a clause to the effect that where it appears to theMinister,  after consultation with the President of the Board ofTrade,  that, with a view to stimulating industry in a development area, it is just and expedient that a. &quot;Q&quot; licence should, be grantedto enable the applicant to carry his own goods between two points,one of which is&quot;in a development area,  the minister may direct the licensing authority-to grant the appropriate licence.The minister of Transport accepts the views of hiscolleagues as to the need for recognising the special positionof such &quot;Cw licenseeo, but considers that there are importantarguments against the inclusion of ai special clause in the Bill/ v/hich

which require consideration &quot;by the Cabinet and these are setout in an annex.      If the Cabinet conclude that on grounds of expediency some special assonance should bo given to tradersin development areas,  the best course night be to add to the considerations to which licensing authorities are to have regardunder paragraph 3,  a rider to the effect that ia. the case of an applicant based in a development area, the Minister,  afterconsultation with the President of the hoard of Trade,  may givea specific direction for the grant of a licence.5.      The extent to which !:C;; licence vehicles are normallyoperated beyond a radius of UO miles from their base cannot be closely estimated, but the be t information available (whichis related to present traffics - see Annex II)  suggests thatthere is an originating traffic of about 9,000,000 tons per annumwhich,  in the absence of any restriction,  could be carried by&quot;C:; licensees for distances beyond 10   dies from their base.If the hO odle radius were applied probably about one third, or3,000,000 tons, would bo allowed to pass under the considerationsmentioned in paragraphs 3 and h above.      Thus,  about 6,000,000 tons,representing a gross revenue of about syi million is the initialannual volume of traffic in dispute.      If this traffic is notsecured to the public system the loss ah 11 be a continuing one and is likely to increa.se in amount.      If this is permitted, itwill lead to the erosion of railborne a;:- well as road traffic,and against this the public system needs to be safeguarded.6.-     The proposed UO mile radius would not interfere with local retail or wholesale distribution or with the short rangeindustrial traffic.      Moreover,  there will be many cases wherethe Licensing Authority can readily be satisfied,  in the  lightof the criteria -mentioned, in (3), that there are good reasonsfor allowing movement beyond the b,0 mile radius.      Taken together,a high proportion of the 0 licensees will remain unaffected butif the aim is a unified and co-ordinated system of public transport by road,  rail and water under national ownership,  there is a j,strong case for-including ordinary long distance haulage movementsby road, in the sphere of the national organisation.      otherwise there may be,  and in the opinion of men well acquainted withhaulage development there is. certain to be a tendency for privateenterprise to counter the public   monopoly by baying vehicles and. taking out C licences.       It would, be unfortunate if theresult v;ere to accentuate that drift or if the national undertakingwere forced, to quote unduly low rates in order to arrest it.A position in which private and public vehicles are running paralleleach with only part loads-cannot be justified in the national interest.     Moreover,  it seems indefensible to allow long distanceC vehicle owners to fall bach on public haulage at will for peak,seasonal and other contingencies or to require those who use thenational transport system to pay higher rates because others,particularly the larger firms,  are able to carry the cream oftheir traffic in their own vehicles.7.      The Committee has considered whether there is anyjustification for exempting owners of si*ugle C vehicles from anydistance limitation.      Most owners of single vehicles are engagedin retail delivery or other employment of a local character.      Ifthey need, to go beyond the proposed qO mile radius they will beable to apply for extension in suitable circumstances.      It wouldbe extremely difficult to discriminate in favour of owners of single vehicles as against those owning two or three vehicles oreven larger fleets,   and the Committee agree with the Minister ofTransport&apos;s conclusion that such a concession to the owner of asingle C vehicle would be inexpedient as well as unnecessary.

3.      Farmers&apos;  licences.    Under the Act of 1933,  goods vehiclesregistered in the na ie of a person engaged in agriculture and usedsolely for the carriage of the produce of,  or articles requiredfor the purpose of,  laud which he occupies, do not require anytype of carrier 5s licence.      The Ainister has not proposed to disturb this position and farmers v:ill remain entitled to transporttheir own agricultural produce or requirements in their ownvehicles irrespective of.distance.      If, however,  a person engagedin agriculture desire;: to carry for hire or reward the goods of another person engaged in agriculture in the same localitrq, he also has the privilege of doing so in any vehicle for which hehas obtained a. 0 licence,  and it is only in respect of thisprivilege that a. farmer,  like any other G licence holder, would,unless he can justify greater latitude, be limited to a hO mileradius.     To allow a farmer to carry not merely his own goods,but also goods for hire or reward under a C licence without theproposed limitation of distance of UO miles would Undoubtedlylead to criticism by established hauliers who are required totake out an A or B licence (and under the Pill would generally be limited to a radius of 25 miles) and would also lead to abuseswhich could not be checked.HAH.Office of the Lord President of the Council,Great George street,  8.&quot;.&apos;/. 1.

A IT IT S X    I.The following are arguments against the inclusion of a clause in the Bill on the lines proposed in Paragraph, u.( a)  the licensing authorities are experienced and impartial people and if such arrangements are essentialthere should he no difficulty in satisfying them tothat effect:(h)  the &quot;Minister will have power under another clause in the Bill to give general directions to theauthorities ;(c) a. further safeguard is the -proposed right of appeal;(d) it will be part of the duty of the Coo.mission toprovide adequate facilities for the development as for other areas.      Duplication of such facilities by private traders will be&apos; wasteful and tend to raisethe cost of traffic to or from the areas where itoccurs.      It is important that the Commission shouldhe encouraged to give the best possible service tothe development areas, the progress of which will certainly not he advanced by extravagant methods oftransport.        The fact that a trader chooses to usei;C&quot;  licence vehicles as a form of advertisement or that ( often upon a basis of inadequate provisionfor overheads) he claims that it is cheaper touse his own rather than public transport,  ought not to entitle him to endanger the public systemupon which the welfare of the majority of tradersmust depend.

In the course of afew yeare,  this tendency might well-/increase the net loss oftraffic to an even  core serious degree.      But the loss of tonnageis not in itself a complete presentation of the damage which theCommission -sight Be expected to sustain.      If the Commission is to fulfil its statutory obligations it will require a nation-wideorganisation the overheads of which oust Be finely Balanced inrelation to the traffic available.      It is doubted if it would bepossible in face of C licence erosion for the Commission eitherto estimate in the first instance the aiount of buildings,  land and plant required,  or to reduce the overheads proportionately toany progressive loss of.traffic.      This situation would result inan increase in rates which would in turn accelerate further lossof tonnage.180,000
