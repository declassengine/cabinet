The Committee will meet regularly, once a fortnight, on Tuesdays at11 a.m.I ask the members of the Committee to make a special point of reserving thesetimes so that they can attend the meetings in person. It is only in the most exceptional circumstances that they should be represented by Junior ministers or officials.5. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will submit to the Committeeperiodical progress reports describing the problems confronting the british administration in Germany and Austria and the progress which is being made towards their solution, and indicating the directions from which special difficulties are likely to arise in the future. These reports will not cover the whole fieldcomprehensively on each occasion : they will take the various subjects in turn,month by month.
Arrangements will also be made for senior members of the british administration in Germany and Austria to meet the Committee from time to time,when they are visiting London, to explain their problems in person.6. During the Foreign Secretary&apos;s absence at the forthcoming meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris, and on other occasions when he is outof the country, I propose myself to preside at the meetings of this Committee.C.
