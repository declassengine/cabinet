THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946. 11\SECRET.CP. (46 ) 230.lith June, 1946.CABINET.Copy No.A kUNITED MARITIME CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.1. I reported in OP. (46) 68 the proposal to establish this body, for a transitional period till the end of October 1946. The proposal was accepted byall the important maritime nations formerly participating in the united maritime Authority. It is open to every nation to join the Council, and theSoviet Government was specially informed of its establishment but has not joined.The Council will begin its first session in Holland on the 18th June.2. Upon the general issues of shipping policy arising, the United kingdom delegation will continue to be guided by the principles stated in CP. (46) 42, theacceptance of which will help to create conditions in which our shipping canrestore and improve upon its position in the world&apos;s carrying trades in faircompetition with other flags.3. Upon one important item on this agenda, however, I particularly desiremy colleagues to be aware of the nature of the instructions to the United kingdom delegation, given after consultation with other Departments concerned. this item concerns the relationship of the United Maritime Consultative Council to theUnited Nations, and the question whether there is to be any continuing inter-governmental shipping organisation after the present transitional arrangementsexpire. This matter has been examined recently by a Temporary Transport and communications Commission established by the Economic and Social Council, inrelation to international transport organisations generally, and the Report ofthis Commission has been discussed by the Economic and Social Council at its current session in New York. The Report proposed that the United nations should sponsor the establishment of a world-wide inter-governmental shippingorganisation to deal with technical matters; and that the United maritime consultative Council, at its forthcoming meeting in Amsterdam, should be requested to consider the permanent inter-governmental organisation needed in shipping with respect to technical questions and to consider whether it mightitself be transformed into such an organisation, and to make a preliminary reporton these questions to the Economic and Social Council before the next session ofthe latter.4. I am anxious to ensure that international discussion of shipping problemsis conducted in the future in a body properly designed for the purpose, and inwhich the initiative and responsibility rests with this country and the other important maritime nations. Though this must be a &quot; world &quot; body, open to all,and related to the United Nations, it can best be built on the basis of war-timeco-operation, which has been very fully developed in shipping.5. Following the general line set by the Report of the Temporary transport and Communications Commission, our delegation will suggest at this sessionof the United Maritime Consultative Council that the proposal that there shouldbe an inter-governmental body in the shipping field, standing in the relation ofa &quot; specialised agency &quot; to the United Nations, merits sympathetic considerationby all the Governments concerned. They will put forward the following proposi-tions for consideration :  (a) There should be a single inter-governmental shipping body to providefor consultation in all matters suitable for inter-governmental discus-sion as regards shipping. Membership should be open to anyinterested nation.

Though this must be a &quot; world &quot; body, open to all,and related to the United Nations, it can best be built on the basis of war-timeco-operation, which has been very fully developed in shipping.5. Following the general line set by the Report of the Temporary transport and Communications Commission, our delegation will suggest at this sessionof the United Maritime Consultative Council that the proposal that there shouldbe an inter-governmental body in the shipping field, standing in the relation ofa &quot; specialised agency &quot; to the United Nations, merits sympathetic considerationby all the Governments concerned. They will put forward the following proposi-tions for consideration : (a) There should be a single inter-governmental shipping body to providefor consultation in all matters suitable for inter-governmental discus-sion as regards shipping. Membership should be open to anyinterested nation.
(&amp;) The constitution of the body should be considered in relation to thesuccessful wartime co-operation amongst the United Nations in shipping matters. Notably it should provide for all matters within its scope to be initiated and developed by discussion between repre-sentatives of Governments with a view to securing common agreement,and its secretariat should not be endowed with initiatory or advisoryfunctions.(c) The body should be consultative in character and representative of governments. No binding decisions should be taken until constituentGovernments have had the opportunity of considering proposals.(d) To handle any specific matter within its terms of reference, and as agreed by the constituent Governments from time to time, the bodymight set up Standing Committees representative of a small numberof nations, e.g., to facilitate consideration of future action by theconstituent nations in a specific field, or to carry on discussions withother official international organisations concerned (in respect of administrative as distinct from substantive questions). Such a standing Committee might be established at an early date to dealwith questions relating to safety of life at sea and such a StandingCommittee would also be the most appropriate method of providingfor consideration in consultation with the proper United Nationsauthority of administrative arrangements in regard to shipping thatmay be necessary for the purposes of the Security Council.6. Since there will be many detailed questions of constitution and procedure to be considered before any conclusion could be come to as to the desirabilityand practicability of any such world shipping body, our delegation will suggestthat the present session of the United Maritime Consultative Council mightestablish a small committee, to meet during July, to consider the. matter in more detail and draw up a draft report for consideration by Governments and membersof the United Maritime Consultative Council in time for the next session ofthat Council in October. Thus consideration of this matter by the importantmaritime countries will be well advanced by the time the Economic and social council meets for its next session.A.
