(46) 240.19rVi June, 1946.CABINET.GENERAL CONDITIONS WHICH IMPEDE THE RECOVERY OF the ruhr AND OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE BRITISH ZONE INGERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.IN CP. (46) 239 I have set out the immediate causes of the present crisis in the Ruhr and have indicated the action which I consider we should now take to restore the output of the Ruhr mines.2. Apart, however, from the questions discussed in the paper referred toabove, there are certain others of a more general character, bearing on theefficiency of the administration in the British Zone which affect not only the welfare ^of the Ruhr coalfields, but also the whole economy of the British Zone.These I propose to refer to briefly in the present report.3. I have no doubt indeed I am convinced that Sir Sholto Douglas andhis staff are doing their best to administer the British Zone within the limitations imposed by the directives under which they are working. In making the observations which follow, I am, therefore, in no sense criticising the way inwhich the task is being tackled by the Commander-in-Chief and his officers.What I am doing is to criticise the conditions under which he and they areexpected to work. Those conditions are, however, I am convinced, such that no reasonable person could expect to obtain a successful result.4. First and foremost, it is absolutely clear that the Quadripartite systemimposed in the Potsdam Agreement is, in existing conditions, absolutely unwork-able. It would be extremely cumbrous and difficult to operate, even if each ofthe four Occupying Powers were genuinely trying to co-operate and to play thegame by one another. It is patent, however, that no attempt at such co-opera-tion is being made by the Russians, and that, while the.French attach more importance to those parts of the Potsdam system from which they benefitdirectly (such as the export of coal from the British Zone), they also consistentlyblock any proposal designed to secure even a slight improvement in the generaleconomy of the country. As might be expected, the British authorities are doing what they can to make the Potsdam system work, although they realise that, with the exception of the Americans, the other parties to the agreement are making no effort to do so. The result is that the British Commander-in-Chieffinds himself involved in an attempt which is foredoomed to failure. But this,is not all, for the efforts which have been, and are being, made in the british zone to comply with the requirements of Potsdam are having the only results which they could have, viz., to reduce the economy of our zone to the verge ofcollapse.5.   In my report on the Ruhr coal industry, I have expressed the view that,we should now impose a moratorium on exports of coal from our zone, in orderto give to the Ruhr industry a chance of recovery.   What I did not state in[31993]
that report, but what I fully recognise, is that there is not the remotest chanceof securing agreement on the Quadripartite level at Berlin for the policy whichI have recommended, not because there is any doubt that it is the right policy but because the question of whether a given policy is or is not the right one is not the criterion by which proposals from particular zones are judged whenthey come to be considered at the Quadripartite level. In other words, i recognise that the policy which is the only proper one for us to take is quite impossible of achievement, so long as the present arrangement persists by which any one of the Occupying Powers can exercise an absolute veto over mattersvitally affecting the administration of a zone occupied by one of the other powers.6. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I should make it clearthat it is not only in regard to the coal mining industry that the Potsdam systemworks in the way in which I have described, for during the discussions whichI had in Germany it became obvious at every turn that that system is impedingevery branch of the economic administration of our zone.7. It goes without saying, also, that the Potsdam system, in its applicationto our zone, pays no attention to the fact we are pouring the British taxpayerbmoney into our zone at a rate this year estimated at  90 million and are beingprevented by Potsdam from raising the economy of our zone to a level at whichwe could make the zone more self-supporting either by manufacturing more ofits needs (such as synthetic petrol, the manufacture of which in the zone is atpresent prohibited) or by increasing exports.8. While the Potsdam system is and for so long as it continues must remain the principal cause of our failure properly to administer our zone, Iam bound to say that I feel that the task of organising the economic life of a highly industrialised population of&apos;22 millions is not one for which a military organisation is best suited. The hierarchical character of the military system is not adapted to dealing with complex economic problems for which there isno answer which is necessarily the right one and which can only be solvedsatisfactorily by policies which recognise the inter-action of large numbers ofdifferent factors. My conclusion is, therefore, that the sooner the purely economicdepartments in our zone can be divorced from military control and placed on agenuinely civilian footing, the better will be our chance both of improving our administration and of reducing the burden imposed by that administration on theBritish Exchequer.9. While I consider that the civilian element in the administration shouldbe given a wider measure of responsibility and control than it now possesses,I consider, also, that the administration could be further improved and its costreduced :-(i) If we were to go much further than the timid steps which we have so fartaken in our zone to associate Germans with us in the administration:(ii) If the British civilian element in our administration were reduced in number but, at the same, improved in quality.10. During my recent tour I met a number of civilian officers of the british military government who were clearly both highly qualified for the posts whichthey held and enthusiastic about the work they were doing. On the other hand,it was perfectly clear that many members of the lower grades were of a differentcalibre, not possessing either the qualifications or the enthusiasm necessary forthe proper discharge of their duties. These defects are due to a variety ofcauses, of which the most important are the relatively unattractive salariesoffered, the fact that neither Government departments nor industries want to spare their really good men, and that such men are themselves unwilling to acceptappointment for the uncertain, but probably short, term of employment inGermany, which can alone be offered them. The fact that, so far, it has been necessary to separate British officials in Germany from their wives and familieshas also exercised an adverse effect on the recruiting of men of a good steadytype. Moreover, the civil departments of the administration still contain largenumbers of military officers awaiting demobilisation. These men have absolutelyno incentive to devote themselves whole-heartedly to their task and, while someof them are disinterestedly rendering most valuable service, there are far too many who do not realise the serious nature of the duties entrusted to them. Many
of these difficulties would disappear if, as I recommend, we were now to take steps to reduce the numbers, and improve the quality, of the British personnelemployed on civilian administrative duties in our zone.11.   To sum up, my view is: (1) that we shall never be able to administer our zone in Germany properlyor make it contribute to the economic recovery of Europe, or to reducethe large sums now being expended on it from the British Exchequer,for so long as we are hampered at every turn by the Quadripartitesystem imposed by the Potsdam agreement, for by some at least of theGovernments concerned that system is not being administered in good faith but is being used as a means for furthering purely national policies;(2) that the military machine is not well adapted for dealing with the complex economic problems involved in administering a highlyindustrialised area comprising 22 million inhabitants, and therefore that the sooner we can place real responsibility for, and control of,economic affairs in the hands of British civil officials the better willbe our chance of establishing an effective administration in our zone,of enabling that zone to make a contribution towards the economic recovery of Europe, and, at the same time, of reducing the scale onwhich money from the British Exchequer is being spent on theadministration of our zone;(3) concurrently with the action indicated in (2) above, we shall gain in proportion to the extent that we are able :-(a) to associate the Geimians to a larger extent in the civil administra-tion of our zone;(5) to reduce the numbers, and improve the quality, of the Britishcivilian personnel engaged on administrative duties in ourzone.(Initialled) E.
