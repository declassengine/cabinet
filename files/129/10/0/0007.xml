THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 207.23rd May, 1946.CABINET.COUNCIL  OE  FOREIGN  MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1 circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the discussions in Paris concerning Germany.E. B.Foreign Office, 23rd May, 1946.DISCUSSIONS  IN  PARIS   CONCERNING  GERMANY.IT was unfortunately impossible to make much progress in Paris either on general questions relating to Germany or on the special question of the Ruhr-There were useful discussions with French experts at the official level aboutthe methods of industrial control in the Ruhr. An agreed report was drawnup, the conclusion of which is that once a decision has been taken on the funda-mental question whether the Ruhr should be politically separated from Germanyit should not be difficult to reconcile any divergencies between the British andFrench authorities on the method of application of the control to the Ruhr mines and industries under whatever plan is approved in principle.The Secretary of State had a long conversation with the French ForeignMinister. M. Bidault restated the French case for the political separation ofthe Ruhr, Rhineland and Saar from Germany and for the immediate creation ofa new State of the Ruhr under international government. The Secretary ofState took the line that he had great sympathy with the French security require-ments but was unable to take a definite line for or against the political separa-tion of the Ruhr for the time being, particularly before the French elections ashe was not sure that some of the French parties might not change their attitude on this question after the election. The Secretary of State also emphasisedstrongly the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the British zone commander in Germany should not be put in an inferior position and that the British zoneshould not be singled out for special measures of international control. We were proposing to go ahead with setting up a new province in the Ruhr and then toconsider whether the industries should be taken over by the provincial government or held in trust by the British commander.The discussion then turned to the level of industry in Germany and whenthe Secretary of State said that it would be impossible to carry out his aims forthe positive development of Ruhr industries to serve European and world needsif they started in a more or less bankrupt position, M. Bidault agreed that itmight be necessary to modify the original French proposal that if a separate-territory was set up in the Ruhr area the level of industry agreed in Berlin wouldnot be affected. But he maintained that the economic arguments which had beenput forward against political separation were not valid, since some of the profits,made in the Ruhr could be used to pay for German imports.There were some useful discussions on the official level with members of theAmerican State Department whose views seemed to be very much in line with ours.At the meetings of Foreign Ministers there was a brief reference to Germanyearly on when Mr. Byrnes produced the American proposals for a 25-year treaty13341   T318751
to ensure the disarmament of Germany. This was badly received by the Russianswho said that they were more interested in ensuring that the immediate dis-armament of Germany laid down in the Potsdam Agreement was being carriedout. German questions were only discussed at any length in the last two days of the Conference. M. Bidault developed the usual French thesis about the ruhr, Rhineland and Saar. The Secretary of State said That the discussion should be on Germany as a whole. He could not discuss one part only as it was first necessary to know whether Germany was to be a centralised or federalisedState. Moreover it was impossible to take any definite decision without consulting the other Powers who were closely concerned. Mr. Byrnes then put forward aproposal that special deputies should be appointed to consider five questions :  (1) Will consideration be given to the internationalisation of the Ruhr andRhineland ?(2) Will German resources be made available for Germany as a whole (i.e.,will the proceeds of exports be available to pay for imports ofGermany as a whole) ?(3) The question of setting up administrative machinery to permit Germanyto be treated as an economic unit.(4) The removal of zonal boundaries.(5) The final limits of Germany in the west.Mr. Byrnes proposed that recommendations on these questions should beput before the Council of Foreign Ministers at its next session in June. He also proposed that the special deputies should study the question of making a treaty with Germany and that the Council of Foreign Ministers should submit a draftpeace settlement to a peace conference on the 12th November. He emphasised that this did not imply that there should at that time be a German Governmentready to accept a treaty.M. Molotov then made a long statement emphasising the importance of the ruhr and reverting to the proposal made by the Soviet Delegation about the ruhr at Potsdam (that it should be treated as part of Germany and controlled by a special four-Power body similar to the Control Council in Berlin). He alsocomplained that he did not receive enough information about what was going on in the Ruhr. The Secretary of State replied that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould supply the Control Council with any information it might require and thatwe should equally like to know what was happening in the Russian zone.At the next meeting M. Bidault made another plea that before submittingthe whole German problem to the deputies a decision should be taken about the saar. Mr. Byrnes said he had no objection to the French proposals about the saar if the French would agree about setting up central administrations inGermany. The Secretary of State reverted to his view that Germany must betreated as a whole and mentioned that while some of Mr. Byrnes&apos;s questions referred to the Ruhr and western boundaries of Germany the eastern boundaryhad also not been finally settled and that the deputies should consider allboundaries. Similarly they should consider the whole of German industry andthe question whether any part of it in any zone should be internationalised.The Secretary of State was unable to give a direct answer about the Saar butagreed that the deputies should take it up as an urgent measure. The Secretaryof State also queried the elate proposed for a peace conference. &apos; There was some further inconclusive and general discussion in the course of which M. Molotovquestioned whether Mr. Byrnes&apos;s proposal was intended to upset the Potsdamdecision which had in fact dealt with all the fundamental issues in Germany.Mr. Byrnes made a statement defending the American proposal for a 25-yeartreaty and said that he would never have put this forward unless he hadreceived Stalin&apos;s prior approval in principle. M. Bidault provided a revisedset of questions to be put to the deputies which altered the emphasis but not toany great extent the substance of the American&apos; proposals.The final meeting was brief. Mr. Byrnes put a direct question to M. Molotovwhether he could now say whether he agreed that special deputies should beappointed to consider German problems, leaving the terms of reference for laterdiscussion. M. Molotov replied that the Soviet Government had not been ableto study these questions which were new to them. Mr. Byrnes then said that he wished to revise the second part of his proposals by providing for a &quot; generalAllied conference &quot; instead of a &quot; peace conference,&quot; and that the date of theconference should not be fixed now but should be fixed by the Council of foreign ministers at its next meeting.   Mr. Bidault said that subject to a reservation
with regard; to the terms of reference he agreed to the proposal. The Secretaryof State said that he agreed to the appointment of special deputies and proposed the following resolution :-&quot; That we appoint special deputies to examine the whole problem ofGermany; to study the implementation of the Berlin decisions; to studyproposals to lead up to the preparation of. a peace treaty and the fixing of frontiers; to take into account the views expressed at this conference on germany and its future, and to present an interim report at the meetingon the 15th June.&quot;In reply to another question from Mr. Byrnes, M. Molotov repeated that hecould not agree to the establishment of the machinery proposed by the UnitedStates Delegation.   In view of this the session was closed.The Council of Foreign Ministers is meeting again on the 15th June andthe discussion on Germany will no doubt be continued. The Secretary of Stateintends to ensure that whatever machinery is set up an early opportunity shouldbe given to the other Powers concerned to express their opinions about the peace settlement with Germany. His idea is that after initial consideration by thespecial deputies of the four Foreign Ministers a preliminary meeting should beheld of all the other Powers concerned (perhaps to be defined as those who havemilitary missions in Berlin) to have a general discussion on these and any other problems. After that a draft peace settlement might be prepared by the Councilof Foreign Ministers for submission to a general peace conference.
