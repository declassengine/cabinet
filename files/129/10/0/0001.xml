(45)  801 COPY NO.   jjj^___24th -May-,   1946CABINETRATIOIJg  &apos; OF    FEEDING    STUFFSMemorandum Toy the minister&amp;ff of Agriculture and Fisheries andthe Gocretary- of State for scotland.       At the meeting of the Cabinet on 2nd May reference was made tothe disastrous effects upon the livestock industry of the further economies required to meet the short ago of wheat.      The Cabinetnevertheless felt bound to decide (CM. (46) 40,  Conclusion 3) thatthe flour extraction rate should bo raised to 90% until30th Beptember next and the position reviewed before that date.In conscq.uen.ee we have had to &quot;announce that rations for farm pigs.and poultry would, for the months of July, August and September, bebased on one-twelfth of pre-war numbers.     Reduced allowances arcalso being made during the summer to cortain classes of dairy animals.2.        The Minister of Food was asked at the meeting of the Cabineton 23rd&apos;May (Cabinet (46) 5 1,  Conclusion 3(5)) to submit proposalsfor securing; further economies in flour consumption in the U.K.      Woconsider that it is desirable that at the same time the cabinet should also be apprised of the prospective deficit in supplies ofrationed feeding stuffs which might be accentuated if any further economies in the consumption of flour are achieved by methods leading to any material reduction in the supply.of milling offals or otherfeeding stuffs.3,        It  is now clear that there will  continue to be a deficit on existing requirements in feeding stuffs supplies during theforthcoming winter period (October to April) of somewhere between490,000 to 750,,000 tons of cereals and of 250,000 tons of protein,the amount of the cereal deficiency depending on the nature of any-further economies in wheat and flour consumption which the Cabinet-may decide to be essential as a result of the decision to accept areduction of 200,000 tons in theUvK; wheat allocation during theperiod May/September,   1946.      In certain circumstances the deficitmight exceed 750,000 tons.      The deficiency of protein arises fromthe cessation of exports of oilseeds from India.      In view of thefamine conditions in that country a resumption of supplies from this source cannot be expected during the current year. . &apos;4. &apos;      The farming community are naturally anxious to know as early as possible whether any further reductions in supplies of feedingstuffs are in prospect cither during the present summer-or in theforthcoming winter rationing period,  October,   1946 to April,   1947.Livestock production must necessarily be planned well ahead and itis very difficult to make adjustments in production programmes at short notice without Involving the farmer in serious difficulties and even heavy losses.      Wo consider therefore that it would bodesirable to decide and announce - at an early date future ration scales up to 30th April,   1947, on the basis of- the best estimates that can be made of future supplies.5,        While it is obviously undesirable to adopt too pessimistic a forecast and thereby cause premature slaughter of stock, which may eventually prove to be unnecessary,  it w6uld.be preferable to proceed on the basis of a reasonably cautious estimate of future supplies,   in
the knowledge that it Is always oasior to make supplementary issues of feeding &quot;stuffs if supplies unexpectedly prove more favourable than&apos; was anticipated,  than to cut down suddenly if the supply position moves adversely..6.    p Calculations have accordingly been made,  after consultationwith&apos;an Advisory Committee of feeding stuffs experts,  of the most appropriate reductions in ration scales&apos; next winter on three alternative assumptions:-A. An extraction rate of 8 5&apos;&apos;&apos;$. with delivery to this country  -of Argentihe&apos;&apos; coarse grains (maize and barley) alreadypurchased;- &quot; --.,&apos;-B. An extraction rate of 85&amp;without delivery to thiscountry of Argentine coarse, grains already purchased;C. An extraction rate of 90J$ without delivery to thiscountry of Argentine coarse grains already purchased.The deficits to be met arising from the above assumptions are estimated as follows:-Protein Cereal&quot;TOOO tons)252 493&apos;252&apos;&apos; 576252 7527.-        The lowest cereal deficit (i.e., Assumption A) could be met by reductions    involving practically all classes of stock exceptworking horses.     Ration issues&apos; for dairy cows would be reduced &quot;by approximately 25 J% for farm pigs and poultry by 40    and - for domesticpoultry &quot;by 60&apos;$ and domestic pigs by 50$  as compared with the scalespreviously in force.      Smaller reductions will also have to&apos;be made in rations for pig and poultry, breeding stock.    - By making an adjustment in the method of assessment pig and poultry keepers with only small areas of land, who cannot be expected to grow feedingstuffs for their stock, will suffer less than the larger farmers who can bo partly self-supporting-,  .   A. number of those small producerswill in fact be  in a better.position than in the latter part of thepresent summer, -when the only means, of effecting a saving (owing tothe introduction of 90^? extraction /flour)&apos;, was by devaluation of thecoupons already issued. /,8,        We recognise that.. the. proposed reduction in rations for pigs,and poultry kept on the domestic scale has political and other aspectwhich the Cabinet will wish to consider.      There will no doubt becriticism from the over       million families that will be affectedwho will have to be content with fewer -pigs or birds in future,  andwill consequently suffer a loss of pigmeat and eggs at a time whenthe ration of other foodstuffs is still relatively small,     .Moreover,there is always a risk of much more widespread illegal usage of bread and oatmeal for,feeding to such stock and it is very difficultto check malpractices of this kind. .    On the- other hand, when suchsevere reductions in supplies of feeding stuffs have to be ..faced,it would be unfair to. the rest of the community to allow thesedomestic stock-keepers to remain in an unduly privileged position.9,        The higher cereal deficit (Assumption B)  could be met by requiring     dairy farmers to provide from their own resourcescereal for the first  1^ gallons of milk and by further lowering the basic ration for farm pigs and poultry by reducing from one-sixthto one-eighth the  1939 numbers eligible for rations, but with a smaller acreage deduction than is shown in the Appendix.AssumptionI!C
10.      The highest cereal deficit (Assumption C) could only he met by still further lowering the basic ration for pigs and poultry,  by continuing the reduced fraction of one-eighth but with an acreagededuction of 1% birds per acre,  and 1 pig per       acres.      Detailsof the reductions on this assumption arc set out in the Appendix.11,      The revised ration scales on each of the three aboveassumptions would save from 230,000 to 242,000 tons of protein,,leaving a deficit of from 22,000 to  10,000&quot;tons as the case may bo,which is within the margin of error of supplies and actual off take.12.      It is difficult to form a reliable forecast of the effectof such reductions in feeding stuffs rations upon the productionof milk,  pigmcat and eggs.      Past experience shows that the loss in output will not be commensurate with the reductions in rations.In particular, wo are advised that many dairy farmers could attaina greater measure of self-sufficiency,  and with normal yields ofhay and other fodder crops and reasonable weather in the autumn and winter,  the loss of milk production might be very small and shouldnot exceed 5$ of the high&apos; 1945/6 figure.      Owing to the recentdrought in certain districts, however, notably in Scotland, yieldsof hay and possibly of other fodder crops may be bolow normal andthis would affect milk output adversely next winter,13,      With bigs and poultry the effect must be more severe.      Notonly arc these classes of stock much more dependent on purchasedfood but the psychological effect of repeated blows to the industry will be more marked end this applies especially to pig keepers whohave always been inclined to cut down or even give up productionin adverse circumstances.      Moreover,   if as we propose,  an effort is made to maintain milk yields by issuing additional rations tothose dairy farmers who cannot roach the assumed standard ofself-sufficiency,  supplementary issues to especially hard-hit pigand poultry keepers must be reduced.      Reductions in output ascompared with 1945/6 may, therefore, be of the order of 30 to 35      tper cent, for pigmcat and 15 to 20 per cent for eggs,14,      Unless the Cabinet arc satisfied that it will be practicable to restore the rate of flour extraction to 85$tby 1st October nextwe recommend that we should be authorised to proceed on the basisof the v/orst of the three Assumptions and announce at an earlydate the appropriate winter scales of rations, with an intimation that any improvement in the supply position that may eventuate, will lead to such issues of supplementary rations as appear to bewarranted.T.W.JAW.
