The situation was, however, completelytransformed shortly after the outbreak of the recent war, for the enlistment inthe Forces of large numbers of the younger miners in 1939 and 1940, coupled withthe decline in output per man shift which followed as the result of the fall in thepercentage of face-shifts to total shifts worked, created a situation in which itwas urgently necessary to reinforce the man-power of the industry if nationalneeds for coal were to be met, even after coal exports had been virtually broughtto an end. It was to meet this need that steps were taken first to recall ex-minersto the mines and later to secure for the mines the services of the Bevin boys.2. Notwithstanding these efforts, man-power in the industry is stilldeclining, though in recent Aveeks there has been a significant improvement in therate of recruitment of juveniles under 18, which in recent years has been extremely low. In other respects also there are signs that the worst is over, forabsenteeism, though still far too high, has recently declined somewhat, whileoutput per man shift, though still far below the pre-war level, is better by at least4 per cent, than a year ago. All these are encouraging signs, but it remains truethat unless we can maintain man-power at least at its present level and put moreheart into the miners, we shall not secure the coal necessary to enable us to get through next winter without serious interruptions of industrial activity. (Forfurther particulars, see attached annex).3. The main problem is still how. we can make the industry sufficiently attractive both to increase the number of recruits and to check the present high rate of wastage. It was with these considerations in mind that at the end of lastyear I requested the National Union of Mineworkers to give me their suggestions for increasing the inflow of recruits into the industry. This they did in the&quot; Mineworkers&apos; Charter &quot; which they submitted to me in March. Some of these demands, such as a shortening of the working day and. the grant of a second week&apos;s annual holiday with pay (continuous with the one week&apos;s holiday alreadygranted) would clearly result in a substantial loss of output. For this reason thegrant of these demands must, in my opinion, be deferred until the productivity of the mines has been.improved, as the result of the major reorganisation of theindustry now to be undertaken by the National Coal Board, to an extent whichwould render possible these improvements without endangering our coal supplies.4. There is, however, one demand included in the &quot; Mineworkers&apos; Charter,&quot;to which both the rank and file of the miners and their leaders attach the greatest importance and which, if granted, would enormously enhance the attractivenessof the industry both in the eyes of the miners themselves and in those ofprospective recruits. I refer to the 5-day week. Early this year I caused aspecial investigation to be made into the probable effect on output of introducingthis change in working conditions in the mines and I have since carefully examined the whole question, jointly with the National Union of Mineworkers.[31982] 3SECRET.CP. (46) 232.17th June, 1946.
5. It is part of the proposal of the National Union of Mineworkers thatthere shall be no loss of earnings as the result of the introduction of a 5-day week. I agree that this stipulation is reasonable but I should be strongly opposedto the shortening of the working week if, in order to obtain this object, a uniformincrease were to be made in wage rates without any incentive to secure improvedattendance for, if the 5-day week were to be introduced in this way, not only would costs per ton be raised appreciably, but there would also be a substantialloss of output through the discontinuance of Saturday working.6. If, however, appropriate conditions were attached to the introductionof a 5-day week, the following advantages would be secured : (1) If wages rates were kept at their present level but a payment equivalentto that for one shift was made to men who worked all five shiftsin a week, miners who now normally work six shifts a week would suffer no loss, those who now normally work five shifts would continueto do so and those who work four shifts or less would be encouraged to work five shifts in order to obtain the bonus payment. An arrange-ment on these lines would reduce absenteeism substantially and soreduce the loss in output now suffered as the result of irregularattendance by the miners.(2) Output per man shift should also improve, through the reduction inabsenteeism, for colliery managers would be able to plan and carry through their work in a way which is impossible when, as at present,they can never tell how many workers will report for duty for any given shift.(3) It would be reasonable to expect also that, once the miners had secured the long-desired 5-day week, they would put an increased effort into their work and so provide a further increase in output per man shift.(4) In so far as improved attendance made it possible to increase thepercentage of face-shifts to total shifts worked, a further improvementin output per man shift would be secured. If this percentage couldbe raised substantially, the improvement in output would be very marked.(5) For historical and other reasons there are numerous practices in thecoalfields which unnecessarily restrict output and a substantialadvantage-would, be secured if the grant of a 5-day week were madethe occasion for bringing these practices to an end. Prominent amongthe reforms needed under this head is the re-measurement of the tasksallotted to piece-workers, in order to put an end to the practice bywhich at present many workers are able to perform their task (andtherefore to earn all the wages that they can) well before the endof their shift.7.   The introduction of a 5-day week would also : (1) act as a most valuable stimulus to recruiting and would thus contributedirectly to raise the volume .of output;(2) provide colliery managers with two clear days at the end cf each week in which to carry out necessary maintenance work, thereby facilitatingwork on the other days of the week and so raising output per manshift8. With so many unknown factors, it is extremely difficult to form anyquantitative estimate of the effect on output of introducing a 5-day week. Iam satisfied, however, that, if this reform was accompanied by the changesindicated in paragraph 6 above, and if, in addition, as a purely temporary measure, the working day wras increased from 7^ to 8 hours, the net effect wouldbe to secure an appreciable increase in output. It is doubtful, however, whetherthe mine-workers would agree to a lengthening of the working day even as atemporary concession to be given in exchange for the benefits of a permanent5-day week. Moreover, such a change would require legislation and would be generally regarded as a retrograde step. The conclusion which I have reachedis that we should not seek to make the lengthening of the working day a conditionto the grant of a 5-day week but that we should insist upon every practicablecondition to secure that a 5-day week shall mean a week consisting of five fullshifts. If we adopt this line, we shall have done everything possible, by improving the attractions of the industry, to secure an increased inflow of recruits, to check wastage, and to get more work from the existing miners, while at thesame time we shall have done all in our power to ward against the risk of lossof output consequent upon the shortening of the working week.
9. From the point of view of increasing recruitment and checking wastage,the sooner the proposed change can be made the better, but the discontinuance of practices which unnecessarily restrict output, which we must secure if we areto protect current output from loss, will involve not only agreement in principle between the Government and the Executive of the National Union of Mine-workers, but also detailed discussions and local agreements at district and collierylevel between colliery managements on the one hand and the district and pitrepresentatives of the National Union of Mineworkers on the other. these discussions will necessarily take some time and, as agreement on the questions at issue must precede the introduction of the 5-day week,&apos;it is not possible atthis stage to fix a definite date for the shortening of the working week.10. The problem is now one of considerable urgency since the annualdelegate conference of the National Union of Mineworkers is due to be held atBridlington on the 26th June, and it will certainly be necessary for me at that conference to make some statement on the attitude of the Government towardsthe &quot; Mineworkers&apos; Charter,&quot; Subject, therefore, to the approval of my colleagues,I propose at the conference to announce that the Government have decided inprinciple to introduce the 5-day week as soon as practicable after agreement isreached in regard to the changes that are necessary to protect the country fromloss of output. I should propose to add that the necessary negotiations to thisend have already been started between the Government and the National Unionof Mineworkers, and that, so far as it rests with the Government, these negotia-tions will be carried through as rapidly as possible.11. A declaration on these lines will, I am convinced, do much to improve the general atmosphere in the industry and will be sufficient to prevent a more serious situation from developing in the coal-fields. It should also stimulaterecruitment, though naturally we shall not get the full benefit under this headuntil the 5-day week is actually introduced. If, however, we are to extract themaximum advantage from the grant of the 5-day week, it is essential that weshould grant some immediate tangible benefit at the same time as we annouce our decision about the 5-day week, for there is no doubt that this is wdhat theminers and their leaders are looking for and what they are determined, if possible,to secure. &quot;What I propose, therefore, is that at Bridlington I should alsoannounce that the Government have decided that as from August Bank Holidaywages-payments will be made in respect of statutory holidays (on which menare debarred from working), subject to the condition that this payment shall only be made to those men who work every possible shift in the week in whicha given statutory holiday falls. This concession is desirable, not only for thereasons to which I have referred, but also because it will bring the position ofthe miners into line with that of workers in many less arduous industries. from our point of view, it has also the concrete advantage that the conditions which,as I have explained, I propose should be attached to these holiday payments arelikely to secure an appreciable improvement of attendance and consequently anincrease of output at holiday periods. This is particularly important in viewof the high absenteeism and substantial loss of output which, for some time pasthas marked each statutory holiday. If every miner were to qualify for a wages-payment at each of the statutory holidays, the maximum additional cost in afull year would be about 5d. a ton, but in practice I do not expect that the extra cost would be more than 3d. a ton.Summary.12. The following is a summary of my principal conclusions andrecommendations : &apos;(1) There are signs that conditions in the coalmining industry are over the worst, though man-power is still falling, voluntary absenteeism isstill too high and output per man shift still too low.(2) If we are to obtain the supplies of coal necessary to maintain our generaleconomy, it is essential that we should at once create conditions whichwill (a) increase recruitment and check the present high rate of wastage;(b) greatly reduce, if not entirely eliminate, voluntary absenteeism;(c) increase output per man shift by eliminating all local practices- which now tend to restrict output.[31982] b 2
(3) These objects can only be secured if we introduce some change in theconditions in the industry which will (a) make it substantially more attractive than at present to theexisting miners, thereby securing both that the miners giveregular attendance at their work and do a full day&apos;s work during each shift;(b) draw recruits into the industry in much larger numbers than atpresent and will also retain in the industry men who would otherwise have left it.(4) The one change in working conditions which, if made, may be expectedto secure the foregoing result would be the grant of the 5-day week,provided that this was granted, subject to conditions which wouldprotect output (a) by providing an incentive to miners to give full attendance;(b) by eliminating all existing practices which restrict output.(5) The conditions which must be attached to the grant of a 5-day weekwill involve negotiations and agreement not only directly betweenthe Government and the Executive of the National Union of Mine-workers, but also at district and pit level throughout the country.(6) It will take some time to secure all the necessary agreements and it istherefore not possible at this stage to announce a date for theintroduction of the 5-day week.(7) It is essential, however, that at the annual delegate conference of theNational Union of Mineworkers to be held at Bridlington at the endof this month I should be in a position to make some statement onbehalf of the Government, in regard to the demands embodied inthe Union&apos;s &quot; Mineworkers&apos; Charter.&quot;(8) An announcement at Bridlington of the Governments intentions inregard to the 5-day week will go a long way towards securing the objects which we have in view, but it is essential that we should alsothen be able to announce some immediate tangible concession.(9) The concession which we can safely make at once is the grant of payin respect of the statutory holidays (Christmas, Bank Holidays, &amp;o).This reform is overdue and, if accompanied by the conditions which i suggest, is likely to result in an actual increase in output.(10) I propose that at Bridlington I should announce- (a) that the Government have decided in principle to introduce the5-day week as soon as practicable after agreement is reached in regard to the changes that are necessary to protect thecountry from loss of output, that negotiations to this endhave already been started with the National Union of Mine-workers and that, so far as it rests with the Government, these negotiations will be carried through as rapidly as possible;(b) that the Government have decided that, as from August bank holiday, wages-payments will be made in respect of statutoryholidays, subject to the condition that this payment/shall onlybe made to those men who work every possible shift in the week in which the statutory holiday falls.E.

StJLANNEX.The Present Outlook for Coal Production and the Action proposed to relieve the demand next winter on available coal supplies.(a) The Present Outlook.Now that we have entered upon a new Coal Year, it is right that we should look at the prospects which face us during the next twelve months. The factors which govern the output of coal are the output per man shift, the numbers of miners available and the extent to which those available give regular attendance.I propose, therefore, to examine briefly the current trends of each of these factors.2. Output per man shift. Before the war the overall output per manshiftamounted to 1-14 tons. In the early part of the war large numbers of the younger miners left the industry to join the Forces, and there was in consequencea significant fall in the percentage of face shifts to total shifts. This was inevitable, since with any given lay-out the number of men required on the surface and underground for work on haulage and maintenance cannot becontracted beyond a certain point, and in consequence any sharp drop in man-power can only be made by reducing the number of face-workers. As a resultoutput per man shift overall fell to 1-07 tons in 1941 and continued to declineuntil in 1944 and 1945 it amounted only to 1-00 tons. In the later part of lastyear, the rate was running at 1-03 tons and in a number of weeks in the presentcalendar year it has reached 1 - 04 tons.3. Various factors have accounted for this improvement, of which probably the most important are (1) that the experienced ex-miners who, during the lastnine months, have been returning to the mines in considerable numbers, have brought with them a higher standard of energy and discipline, and (2) that weare beginning to secure the advantages of the increased mechanisation intro-duced into the mines during the war. Whichever may be the more important of these causes, we are entitled to conclude that, so far as concerns output permanshift, the adverse factors introduced by the war are ceasing to operate andto look forward to further improvement. This is likely to be particularly markedwhen we are able to dispense with the Bevin boys and others compulsorilyrecruited into the industry during the war, in so far as their departure does not mean transferring men from the face to the haulage, for many of these were unwilling workers and contributed less than their fair share to the total output.4. Number of available miners. Shortly after the end of the 1914-18war there began a fall in the number of men on colliery books, the numberdeclining almost uninterruptedly from 1,227,000 in 1920 to 782,000 in 1938.During these years, however, the fall did not exercise an adverse effect on output,for throughout that period the limiting factor was not the amount of coal whichcould be produced by the available man-power but the extent to which marketscould be found for such coal as was produced. With the outbreak of war in1939, this fall in man-power acquired a new momentum, owing to large numbersof miners joining the Forces, until in May 1941 the number of men on collierybooks declined to 690,000. At that point it became necessary to take steps to check the fall, first, by the recall of miners from other industries and later by various forms of compulsory recruitment. These measures secured an increasein numbers to 717,000 in March 1945, when a new decline set in which was onlychecked last winter by the return of men from the Forces.5. At the present time the number of men on colliery books is 699,000. Itwould, however, have fallen to about 664,000 if it had not been for the returnto the mines during the last 8 months of 24,800 ex-miners from His Majesty&apos;forces and of 11,000 ex-miners from other industries. Both these are non-recurrent items which have already largely exhausted themselves. the demobilisation of the Bevin boys and the restoration of freedom to leave theIndustry which will follow the final withdrawal of the Essential Work Orderwill both inevitably lead to. further losses of man-power. For these reasons and because of the disproportionately large numbers of miners in the higher age-groups, it must be expected that for the next few years gross wastage will &quot;beabnormally high.6. The problem of recruitment is therefore one of exceptional importance,tor, if We are to avoid a further substantial decline in the total number of men inthe industry it will be necessary not only to secure enough recruits to make
good normal wastage but also to make some contribution towards filling the gapcreated by the exceptional losses of man-power which we must certainly expect.7. Before the war the annual intake of juveniles was of the order of 25,000per annum, but since 1939 the number has declined sharply until in 1945 itamounted only to 9,000. It was especially to deal with this problem that somemonths ago I took steps to start a comprehensive recruiting campaign for the mines. It will take some time before we obtain the full benefits of these efforts,but already, in recent weeks, there has been a significant improvement in the intake of juveniles as compared with the corresponding period last year. In thesame period adult recruits from other industries have been coming in in encouraging numbers. These results suggest that in the matter of recruiting (asin that of output per man shift) we are now over the worst and that, if we canenhance the attractions of coalmining in relation to other industries, we may reasonably hope substantially to increase recruiting- between now and the timewhen, upon the technical reorganisation of the industry, we can obtain the coal which we require with a smaller labour force than is now necessary for that purpose.8. Absenteeism. In 1938 absenteeism amounted only to 6-4 per cent.Practically the whole of this may be regarded as involuntary absenteeism due toinjuries, sickness, or other unavoidable causes, for in the inter-war years low wages, short time, and high unemployment combined to make the miners only tooanxious to secure whatever work was available. In this period, therefore, therewas no problem of voluntary absenteeism. With the war a new situation arose,for wages w;ere substantially advanced and all men were offered full employmentevery week. Moreover, the Essential Work Order which tied men to the industry,made it difficult to discharge even men who gave unsatisfactory attendance. Itis not surprising, therefore, that by 1945 the average rate of absenteeism had arisen to 16-3 per cent, of which 9-2 per cent, was classed as involuntary and per cent, as voluntary.9. During last winter absenteeism was for the most part about 17 per cent.,of which about 2 per cent, was in respect of men who voluntarily absented them-selves from work for a complete week at a time. During this period, the ratefor voluntary ^absenteeism was about 8-5 per cent. In recent weeks, there hasbeen a considerable improvement in the average rate of attendance, the overallrate of absenteeism having declined to about 14-5 per cent., while voluntaryabsenteeism has fallen to about 7-5 per cent. The position as regardsattendance is still far from satisfactory and is likely to continue so until theBevin boys have been eliminated from the industry and until the disappearance of such adverse conditions as inadequate rations, shortage of consumers&apos; goods,and liability for income tax (with the special incentive to absenteeism offered by the operation of the system of P.A.Y.E.). Notwithstanding all this, we may reasonably hope that in the matter of absenteeism, like the other factors discussedabove, the worst is now over, and that we have a good chance of restoring a proper standard of attendance on the part of the miners.(b) Action proposed to relieve the demand next winter on available coal supplies.10. The foregoing particulars show that, although the situation is far fromsatisfactory, the signs at last are definitely encouraging: a further decline inman-power is inevitable, but recruitment is showing a definitely more buoyanttendency; voluntary absenteeism is still much too high, but has recently begun to decline; output per man shift, though still far below the pre-war level, is betterby at least 4 per cent, than it was a year ago. All this is to the good, but unless we take steps to accentuate the rate of improvement under each of theseheads, we shall find ourselves in severe difficulties next winter. Shortly, theposition is that we managed to get through last winter without any seriousinterruption of industrial activity, partly because, as the result of the appealthat I made last autumn, output during the winter exceeded the total originallybudgeted for and partly because, owing to a variety of factors consumption duringthe winter was lower than had been expected. Even so, current supplies fell short of requirements by 3 - 2 million tons, and this deficit had to be made goodby drawing upon distributed stocks which, at the end of the winter, stood at the record low level of 6-8 million tons. Thus we started this year with lowerreserves than in any previous year, which is all the more unfortunate, since ifwe are to secure our planned level of industrial activity (including the achieve-ment of the export target) we must this year ensure that total coal supplies shallamount to 194 million tons, as compared with 181 million tons obtained lastyear from current production.
11. It is my intention to do everything possible to supplement supplies ofcoal from the mines and from other sources and for this purpose to take all possible steps : (a) to encourage industry and public utilities to turn over from coal to oil fuel;(&amp;) in conjunction with other Departments, to ensure that there shall be adequate supplies both of fuel oil and of appliances for the use of suchfuel;(c) to increase the output of opencast coal above the present target and toensure that all necessary preliminary work is carried out so as toprevent there being any delay in opening up new sites;(d) to double the output of coal briquettes from the Government-ownedfactories, to investigate the possibility of manufacturing briquettes ofpeat and generally to develop the use of peat as a fuel in suitableareas;(e) to improve still further the arrangements for the distribution of coal, sothat, if necessary, we may be able at the end of next winter to reducedistributed stocks to an even lower level than we did in the winter justclosed.12. The action which I propose to take to this end is set out in the paper towhich the present note forms an annex.
