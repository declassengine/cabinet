(k-6)  226UgTH JUNE o  19U6CABINETWORTH BORNEOMemorandum by.the Secretary of State  for the colonies the Cabinet was informed on 5th March,  19/4.6,  (CP.  (46)  93)of the difficulties that had arisen in regard to the financial terms for the transfer to the Crown of the British North Borneo(Chartered) Company&apos;s sovereign rights and assets in North Borneo.At a Cabinet meeting on 3.1 th March,  I946,  (CM.   (46)  23rdConclusions, Minute 8) I was authorised to continue negotiationswith the Company with a view to securing agreed arbitrationterms on the basis proposed by she Government.      It was also agreed that the Company should not be invited to resumeadministration pof the  territory pending settlement of thefinancial basis of the  transfer.2.      I am glad to report that the Court of Directors of theCompany, has now agreed to the Government5 s basis for arbitration, vis.,&quot;The arbitrator snail ascertain the fair price ontin. day of transfer on the basis of -(a) the net maintainable  revenue(b) the number&apos;of years purchase which,  inthe opinion of the Arbitrator should beapplied thereto.&quot;The Directors have also agreed that in making the award,   the Arbitrator shall add nothing as compensation to the company for any effect on the condition of the Borneo assets of damage or deterioration consequent upon the war of 1939-45.3.      I will not trouble my colleagues with the other provisionsof the necessarily lengthy draft Agreement for the transfer ofthe  territory,  the  terms of which have been settled inconsultation with the Treasury,  and agreed with the Court of directors.  -4.      The Court of Directors has still to obtain the consentof the shareholders.      They propose to call a meeting on25th June,  I.940a      A circular,  covering the draft Agreement,will be issued to the shareholders on about 15th June.5.      If;,  as I understand Is probable,  the shareholders acceptthe recommendations of the Court of Directors,  the agreement will,  if possible,  be  signed, before  the 1st of July,  so asto enable  the Company to give their Debenture Holders  the requisite six months&apos;  notice of redemption.      Unless it issigned before then,  the Company will have to defer noticeuntil December,  1946,      I hope  that it will ,be possible to resume civil administration in the territory on or about theI5th of July.

6.      As my colleagues are aware,   there has been someParliamentary interest in this matter.      Apart fromthat,  I understand that since this transaction willimpose a financial burden on the taxpayer,  it isnecessary,  on constitutional grounds,  to seek parliamentary approval but that, for this purpose,  it will be sufficientif a statement is made in the House at the earliest opportunity,  and before the Agreement, is signed, brieflysummarising the proposals and stating, the intention to seek Parliamentary approval of the necessary financial provision in due course.      I am arranging to make such astatement at the first opportunity after the WhitsunHeceso.      attached is a draft of what I propose to say.7.      I accordingly seek the approval of the Cabinet to sign, on behalf of His&apos; Majesty,  an Agreement for thetransfer of the Borneo sovereign rights and assets tothe Crown in the terms agreed   with the Court of directors of the Company,  subject to my making a statement inParliament on the lines proposed in the preceding paragraph and. provided that the shareholders of theCompany consent when the matter is put to them onthe 25th June.G. H. II.Colonial Office,  S.W-.1.lhTK JUNE,   1946.

/jbpbf/dixdraft action&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonieswhether he is able to make any further statement regardingthe negotiations with the British North Borneo (Chartered)Company for the assumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of direct responsibility for the administration of the territory.&quot;DitiFT PPIBY&quot;Agreement has now been reached between the Governmentand the Directors of the Company on the terms for thetransfer of the North Borneo rights and assets to the Crown.These  terms are embodied in a draft Agreement which hasbeen circulated to the shareholders of the Company withthe Directors&apos;  recommendation for its acceptance;      Underthe draft Agreement the compensation to be paid by the crown to the Company is to be determined by an Arbitrator on thebasis of (a) the net maintainable revenue and (b) the numberof years purchase which,  in the opinion of the Arbitrator,should be applied thereto.      It is proposed to execute anAgreement in the terms of this draft if the shareholders a;proveit at their meeting on the 25th of June and I hope that itwill be possible for the Borneo rights and assets to betransferred to the Crown on the 15th July or shortly afterwards,as the Government cannot set up a civil administration in that territory,   to replace the  existing military administration,before the date of transfer.It will be necessary to provide a Grant-in-Aid towardsthe coat or the administration of the territory,  owingto the loss of revenue-earning capacity resulting fromthe Japanese occupation;    provision must also be made

12 o&apos;for rehabilitation costs, for the compensation to be paidto the Company, and for the cost of the Arbitration Tribunal.This will be included in supplementary estimates to be brought before Parliament in due course.I should like to add that the Chief Civil AffairsOfficer in North Borneo, who has had over thirty years&apos;service in that territory as a civilian, has telegraphedexpressing the view that there was no question but that all communities in North Borneo would welcome  the proposed transfer.        He went on to indicate that there was generalrecognition of the fairness and justice of CharteredCompany rule, but that the general feeling was that thechange would accelerate:&apos; the development of the countryand bring with it a consequent increase of prosperity.&quot;
