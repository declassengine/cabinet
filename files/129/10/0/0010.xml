THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERN MEN&apos;&quot;Printea for the Cabinet.   May 1946.secret copy No.    3 8CP. (46) 210.mh May, 1946.CABINET.REPATRIATION OF SOVIET CITIZENS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Recommendations.I recommend that the Cabinet should decide (i) to cancel the rulings on the repatriation of Soviet citizens given in WarCabinet Conclusions 115 (44) of the 4th September, 1944 (see annex 1).(ii) to authorise the issue of instructions to the British military authorities on the lines of the American directive quoted in Annex 2 to this paper.C onsiderations.2. On the 4th September, 1944, the War Cabinet ruled (War cabinet conclusions 115 (44)) that we should agree to the Soviet Governments request to repatriate their prisoners from the United Kingdom and that we should instruct the Middle East authorities to send back all Russians whom the soviet authorities wished to have back, irrespective of whether or not the men wishedto return. On the 16th October, 1944, at the Moscow Conference, M. Molotov saidto Mr. Eden that the Soviet Government demanded as their right that all Sovietcitizens should be returned to the U.S.S.R. Mr. Eden replied that he had noobjection to their return. In accordance with Mr. Eden&apos;s assurance toM. Molotov, it has hitherto been our practice to hand over to the Soviet repatria-tion authorities all persons whom we regard as coming under the RepatriationAgreement which we concluded with the Soviet Government at Yalta on the11th February, 1945. The text of this agreement is attached as Annex 3 tothis paper.3. The text of the Agreement contains no provision laying down whatdegree of coercion is to be used to secure the repatriation of Soviet citizens whoare reluctant to return to their homes, and in point of fact the vast majority ofthe Soviet citizens coming under the Agreement have now been repatriatedwithout disturbance. There remain, however, groups of recalcitrants in varioustheatres whom it may not be possible to repatriate without resort to coercion.4. On the 30th January last, in the Overseas Reconstruction Committee,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster questioned the desirability of usingforce to secure the repatriation of these recalcitrants, pointing out that&apos;theconsequences might be unpleasant. As a re&apos;sult, it was agreed that our policy asregards the repatriation of Soviet citizens should be reviewed (O.R.C. (46)3rd meeting). In the meantime instructions were given to commanders in all european theatres that the use of force in the repatriation of Soviet citizens wasto be suspended.5. I now recommend, after consultation with the War Office, the ControlOffice for Germany and Austria and the State Department, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should bring their policy regarding the repatriation of Soviet citizensinto line with that followed by the American Government, as laid down in the directive attached as Annex 2 of this paper. This means, in brief, that we shallapply the principle of compulsory repatriation only to such Soviet citizens as were captured in German uniforms, or who were members of the Soviet Armed13347   [31897] b
Forces on or after the 22nd June, 1941, and were not subsequently dischargedtherefrom, or who can be shown to have rendered aid and comfort to the enemy.Only persons who were both citizens of and actually within the Soviet Union onthe 1st September, 1939, will be regarded as Soviet citizens for this purpose., 6. I submit this recommendation to the Cabinet because it involves a departure from the War Cabinet Conclusions of the 4th September, 1944, andfrom Mr. Eden&apos;s assurance to M. Molotov of the 16th October, 1944, to which Ireferred in the first paragraph of this paper.7. The advantages of bringing our policy into line with that of the americans as set out in Annex 2 are i(a) that we shall in future have an  agreed  policy  for  dealing  withrecalcitrants in areas of joint command, such as Italy;(b) that by so doing we shall also bring our policy substantially into con-formity with the resolution on refugees and displaced persons adoptedby the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation on the12th February, 1946, under which the compulsory repatriation of refugees and displaced persons other than war criminals, quislingsand traitors is prohibited.8. In recommending this modification of our policy to the Cabinet, I wishto point out that there has been an evolution in the views of the Soviet authorities on this question since M. Molotov stated in 1944 that the Soviet Governmentdemanded as their right that all Soviet citizens should be returned to the U.S.S.R.In September 1945, at the Council of Foreign Ministers, M. Molotov said that&apos;&apos; the Soviet Government did not ask for the forcible return of those who hadnot committed crimes against the Soviet Union.&quot; M. Vyshinsky spoke in thesame sense at the General Assembly of U.N.O. (Journal of the General Assembly,page 536) and Marshal Zhukov has recently requested the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens who fought against the United Nations with weapons intheir hands or by other methods. The restriction of forcible repatriation to thethree categories of Soviet citizens specified in the American directive at Annex 2is, I believe, in accordance with this evolution of Soviet policy.E. B.Foreign Office, 29th May, 1946.ANNEX 1.Extract from War Cabinet Conclusions 115 (44) 4th September, 1944.PRISONERS OF WAR.Disposal of Russians captured in Normandy.1. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 492) about the disposal of Soviet prisoners captured in France and in the Middle East.   The Foreign Secretary proposed (i) that we should agree to the Soviet Governments request to repatriatetheir prisoners from the United Kingdom;(ii) that we should instruct the Middle East authorities to send back allRussians whom the Soviet authorities wished to have back, irrespective-tive of whether or not the men wished to return; and that the practiceof obtaining statements from the Soviet prisoners as to their willing-ness to return should be discontinued;(iii) to explain to the Soviet Government that shortage of shipping made it impossible for us to accede to their request that we should arrangefor repatriation from the United Kingdom.After a short discussion the War Cabinet approved these proposals.
ANNEX 2.Directive to General McNasney and General Clark concerningRepatriation of Soviet Citizens.THE following directive will guide you as to repatriation of persons-determined by you to be Soviet citizens The contents of this directive arebeing communicated to the Soviet Government through diplomatic channels. Thisdirective should also be released to the appropriate Soviet authorities interestedin the repatriation of Soviet citizens.   Text of directive follows:-&quot;Over 2,034,000 Soviet citizens have already been repatriated from western Germany, leaving only approximately 20,000 Soviet citizens in theUnited States zone in Germany. It is the policy of this Government, pursuant to the agreement with the Soviet Union at Yalta, to facilitate the earlyrepatriation of these persons to the Soviet Union. In the execution of thispolicy you will be guided by the instructions which follow:  &quot;1. Persons who were both citizens of and actually within the soviet union on the 1st September, 1939, and who fall into the following classeswill be repatriated without regard to their wishes and by force ifnecessary:  &quot; (a) Those captured in German uniforms.&quot; (b) Those who were members of the Soviet armed forces on or afterthe 22nd June, 1941, and who were not subsequently dischargedtherefrom.&apos;&apos; (c) Those who are charged by the Soviet Union with having voluntarilyrendered aid and comfort to the enemy, where the Soviet Unionsatisfies the United States military authorities of the sub-stantiality of the charge by supplying in each case, with reason-able particularity, the time, place and nature of the offences andthe perpetrator thereof. A persoAs announced resistance to hisrepatriation or his acceptance of ordinary employment in german industry or agriculture shall not of itself be construed as con-stituting rendition of aid and comfort to the enemy.&quot; 2. Every effort should be made to facilitate repatriation of personswho were both citizens of and actually within the Soviet Union on the1st September, 1939, but who do not fall into any of the classes defined inparagraph 1. However, in the case of such persons, you are not requiredto compel involuntary&apos; repatriation. With respect to these persons you aredirected :  &quot; (a) To permit Soviet authorities, on their own request and respon-sibility, free access to these persons for the purpose of persuadingthem to return voluntarily and assisting them to do so.&quot; (b) To take such practical steps as you may deem appropriate to minimise the development of organised resistance to repatriation, such asseparating existing groups into smaller groups, segregatingknown leaders of any resistance groups, and such other practical measures as you may deem appropriate to prevent the continuanceor recurrence of organised resistance.&quot; (c) To continue vigorous efforts to prevent the dissemination of propa-ganda of any kind designed to influence these persons againstrepatriation.&quot; 3. You are authorised in your discretion to permit Soviet authoritiesto have access to persons not specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 who are claimed to be Soviet citizens by the Soviet Union for the purpose of persuading themto return to their homes under practical arrangements which exclude the useof force, threat or coercion. .&quot; 4 Efforts should be continued to facilitate the transfer to the soviet union of all persons who, since the 1st September, 1939, have been given theright to become Soviet nationals, who affirmatively assert this right, and whoindicate that they desire the transfer.&quot;[31897]
