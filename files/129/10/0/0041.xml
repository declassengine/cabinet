THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946.Copy No.GABINET.BROADCASTING POLICY.Joint Memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Postmaster-General.THE current Royal Charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation expireson the 31st December, 1946.2. At their meeting on the 20th December, 1945 (CM. (45) 64th Conclusions,Minute 1), the Cabinet approved the recommendations contained in the Reportof the Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting (CP. (45) 293) regarding theGovernments future broadcasting policy. On the 1st April, 1946 (CM. (45)29th Conclusions, Minute 9) the Cabinet approved our proposals regarding theproposed reorganisation of the B.B.C. home services, which will take effect aboutthe beginning of October 1946.The Parliamentary Position.3. On the 18th February, 1946, the Prime Minister undertook, in answer toa Supplementary Question by Mr. Butcher, M.P., that, before the B.B.C Charterwas renewed, the House should have an opportunity of discussing whether ornot an independent investigation should first be held into broadcasting policy.4. It seemed to us to be very desirable that there should be a general debate on broadcasting policy and that this should take place before the home services were reorganised. That reorganisation, although it will mean a general improve-ment in the services, will worsen the service received by people in certain partsof the country, and we do not want the tone of the debate to be set by the complaints of this comparatively small minority of listeners. We had hopedaccordingly that it would be possible to arrange that the debate should takeplace on a Supply day about the middle of July, and for this purpose we had prepared the attached White Paper on Broadcasting Policy, for the publicationof which we now seek the approval of the Cabinet. A copy of the current B.B.CRoyal Charter and Licence are also attached for convenience of reference.5. Since the draft White Paper went to print, a motion has been putdown in the House of Commons to the following effect :  British Broadcasting Corporation (Charter) That the question of the renewal, with or without amendment, of the charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation be referred to a joint select Committee of both Houses [an early day].6. The list of sponsors of this Motion is formidable. It is headed byMr. Churchill, and includes the leading members of the Conservative, Liberaland Liberal National parties, and such Independent Members as Mr. Bartlett,Sir Alan Herbert and Mr. W. J. Brown. Clearly, therefore, the demand for aJoint Select Committee must be treated seriously. Before the first B.B.C.Charter was granted in 1927 the Government of the day appointed an indepen-ient committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Crawford, to advise it on the[31996] BSECRETCP. (46) 241.list June, 1946.
policy to be adopted and a similar course was followed with the appointment ofthe Ullswater Committee in 1936 to advise on the renewal of the Charter. Thepossibility of repeating this procedure in 1946 was considered by the ministerial committee on Broadcasting, but the unanimous opinion of the Committee, whichwas subsequently endorsed by the Cabinet, was that the appointment of suchan independent body was unnecessary. Undoubtedly, however, a plausible casecan be made out for an independent enquiry into the workings of a public corporation whose essential feature is its political impartiality and which entersso largely into the day-to-day life of the people. Moreover, although no membersof the Labour Party have put their names to the motion, it is possible that theidea of a Joint Select Committee will prove attractive to some of them. Weare satisfied, however, that a Joint Select Committee would contribute no more to the efficiency and prosperity of British broadcasting than an enquiry along the lines of the Ullswater Committee. Any radical alteration in the existing organisation, such as the setting up of competitive broadcasting bodies, is ruled out by the shortage of available wavelengths. Moreover, time is short, and theB.B.C. is already embarrassed in its work of planning by uncertainty as to its future. We feel, therefore, that, provided we can carry the parliamentary labour Party with us, the proposal embodied in the motion should be firmlyresisted. If this is agreed we suggest that the motion should be made theoccasion for the debate which we had intended to take place during July andthat the Opposition should be invited to nominate a Supply clay for this purpose.The Contents of the White Paper.7. We have aimed at making the White Paper in part a public relationsdocument and for this purpose have included in it a considerable amount ofinformatory material covering the whole field of British broadcasting. For themost part the policy which it lays down is that contained in the report of the ministerial Committee on Broadcasting, but we would draw the particular attention of our colleagues to the following points :  (i) Ministerial Responsibility.8. It will be remembered that the Cabinet, at their meeting &quot;on the21st February (CM. (46) 7th Conclusions), took the view that it was undesirable to name any specific Minister as having formal responsibility for matters of highpolicy affecting the B.B.C. as this might suggest that the Government intendedto take a much greater measure of control over the Corporation than it had inthe past. In his statement in the House of Commons on the 7th March on thefuture of the Government Information Services, the Prime Minister accordinglyinformed the House that Questions on major broadcasting policy should beaddressed to him. Since that statement was made, it has become pretty generally known that the Lord President is acting as the Prime Ministers deputy on broadcasting matters, and we hope that the. terms of the White Paper will make clear the degree of control that the Government intends to exercise over the B.B.C.With the approval of the Prime Minister, therefore, paragraph 19 of the white paper clarifies the Lord Presidents position as the Minister who will answer questions on major broadcasting policy save where they fall clearly within theprovince of one of his colleagues, and the White Paper, if approved, will be presented to Parliament jointly by the Lord President and the Postmaster-General.(ii) Salaries of B.B.C. Governors.9. It will be seen from paragraph 20 of the White Paper that it is our intention to reduce the salaries payable to Governors, other than the chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board, from  1,000 per annum to  600 per annum.The B.B.C. Board meets once a fortnight, and the office of Governor does not otherwise make any substantial call upon the time of its holder. The proposedsalary reduction, which has been agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is designed to prevent the B.B.C. being quoted as a precedent for the payment of excessive salaries to part-time members of the boards of other public corporations.(iii) Consultation between the Governors and the Staff.10. We consider that the Charter should contain specific provision for theestablishment of adequate joint consultative machinery between the staff and the
Board of Governors. It will be seen, therefore, from paragraph 23 of the draft white Paper that we propose to insert in the new Charter a provision similarto that contained in the Coal Industry (Nationalisation) Bill and the CivilAviation Bill imposing upon the Governors the obligation to enter into consulta-tion with the representatives of appropriate staff organisations for this purpose.We do not envisage, however, that the new Charter should entitle the staff associa-tions to a voice in programme policy. Such a provision would undoubtedly be resented by the Corporation as an infringement of their responsibility, and wedo not consider that questions of this sort which are mainly matters of tasteand involve the impartiality of the B.B.C. are appropriate subjects for joint consultation. We have, however, satisfied ourselves that the Director-General is fully aware of the need to give all his responsible officers a proper voice in the formulation of policy.(iv) Radio Luxembourg.11. Paragraph 44 of the White Paper repeats the statement which theLord President made in the House of Commons on the 30th April, 1946, that theGovernments policy is to do everything they can to prevent the direction ofcommercial broadcasting to this country from abroad and that, to this end, theywill use their influence with the authorities concerned.12. We should warn our colleagues that Radio Luxembourg proposes to resume commercial broadcasting on the 1st July, and that a means has been found of enabling British companies to purchase time in its programmes and so to avoidinfringing Exchange Control regulations. Negotiations are still proceeding withthe Luxembourg Government with a view to the whole of the programme time onRadio Luxembourg, other than that required by the Luxembourg government itself, being made available to the British and French Governments for broad-casts to Germany, Austria and Central Europe, but it is by no means certainthat these will succeed. It may also be possible to close the loophole through which British companies are at present able to evade the exchange control and purchase time on the station. We must, however, face the prospect that these efforts may fail, and that Radio Luxembourg will once more become a com-mercial station. We feel, therefore, that, while we must persevere in our efforts to prevent commercial broadcasting directed to this country from stations over-seas, there may come a time when we have to recognise that these efforts have failed; that commercial broadcasting has successfully re-established itself, andthat something must be done to allow British companies to use stations like RadioLuxembourg on an equal footing with their foreign competitors.(v) Finance.13. The passages in the White Paper relating to finance implement therecommendations of the Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting. Effect hasalready been given to one of these by the increase in the wireless licence chargeas from the 1st June, 1946. We should point out that, while there is little doubtthat practically all the increased revenue will be needed to meet the anticipatedexpenditure of the B.B.C. within a few years&apos; time, it seems probable that itwill produce a surplus for the Exchequer of about  2 millions during the current financial year and perhaps &amp;1\ millions during 1947-48. There may, therefore,be a substantial amount of criticism on the ground that the Government is using the B.B.C. licence charge as an indirect means of taxation. We do not thinkthat this should prove difficult to dispose of. Clearly, it is impossible so to equatethe licence revenue and the B.B.C.&apos;s current expenditure so precisely as to prevent a surplus arising, and if this surplus did not accrue to the Exchequer, it wrouldbe impossible to maintain any real financial control over the Corporation. More-over, the right of the State .to any surplus accruing after full provision had beenmade for broadcasting services was endorsed by the independent Crawford Com-mittee in 1926, mainly on the ground that the Government safeguards the listeneragainst exploitation and exercises regulative functions without which broad-easting would be thrown into chaos. It is also relevant to point out that, owingto the impossibility of collection, receivers of broadcasting and television pro-grammes pay no entertainment tax. Logically, there is little reason why theyshould not do so, and, when it is remembered that during the financial year1046-47 people who went to other forms of entertainment paid over  51 millions in tax, it does not seem unreasonable that the surplus from wireless and televisionlicence fees should accrue to the Exchequer.[31996] b 2
: 114. The size of the anticipated surplus during the current year may also flead to a renewal of the plea that old age pensioners should obtain their licencesat a reduced charge. This, we think, must be resisted. Such a concession wouldrequire legislation and would set a dangerous precedent for giving similar concessions to a number of other classes such as the sick and ex-service men. Itwould also mean that the benefit of a reduced charge would be given to a largenumber of people who were perfectly able to pay the very reasonable sum oftwo-thirds of a penny per day for their wireless entertainment.H.

BROADCASTING policy a. THE BRITISH BROADCASTING- CORPORATION&apos; S CHARTER,I. Historical Retrospect1. The first public service of wireless broadcasting in Great britain was opened in 1922 by the British Broadcasting Company, a commercialundertaking sponsored by the principal British radio manufacturers. this company, which operated under a short-term licence from the Postmaster -General, derived its revenue partly from royalties charged on the sale ofj^ireless receiving sets and partly from the receipts from the issue ofywireless receiving licences.2. The original British Broadcasting Company, although it did excellentpioneer work with the limited resources then available, did not provide auniversally acceptable service, and the various aspects of broadcasting werethe subject of enquiries by committees appointed by the Postmaster-General in 1923, under the Chairmanship of Sir Frederick: Sykes, and in1925, under the Chairmanship of the late Earl of Crawford and Balcarres.Their reports (Cmd. 1951 and 2599) recognised the part played by theBritish Broadcasting Company in establishing the service, but found thatthe range and functions of broadcasting in the fields of entertainment,culture and education, its social and political possibilities, and its potentialpower over public opinion called for more control by the State.3. The Sykes Committee, in recommending a single broadcasting-service, had in mind not only the part which broadcasting would play in the life of the nation and in international relations, but also the need to use the limited number of wavelengths available for this purpose in thebest interests of the community.4. The Crawford Committee, in endorsing this recommendation,considered and rejected the alternatives of continuing the British Broad-casting Company in its existing or in a modified form or of placing theservice under direct Government control. It rejected the United Statessystem of free and uncontrolled broadcasting as unsuited to this countryand felt that no body constituted for profit could adequately perform the broader functions which were then beginning to emerge. On the otherhand, it equally rejected the transfer of the service to the direct controland operation of the State, on the grounds that the State would lack thenecessary freedom and flexibility to meet the varying demands of thepublic. The Committee recommended, therefore, that broadcasting shouldbe conducted by a public corporation to be known as the British Broad-casting Commission, acting as Trustee for the national interest; that itsstatus and duties- should correspond to those of a public service; and that,although Parliament must retain the right of ultimate control, and thePostmaster-General must be answerable to Parliament for broad questionsof policy, the Commission should be invested with the maximum freedomwhich Parliament was prepared to concede.5. The Crawford Committee also proposed that the Commission should consist of from five to seven Commissioners (later styled Governors),nominated by the Crown. It rejected the suggestion that the governors should represent the various interests concerned with broadcasting, suchas music, drama, education and manufacturing, on the grounds that such appointments might lead to a division of allegiance between the Governors&apos;responsibility for the brodcasting service and their special interests.    It
considered that they should be persons of judgment and independence, whowould inspire public confidence by having no other interests to promotethan those of the public service. It recommended that they should beappointed for a term of five years.6. The Crawford Committee also recommended that the commission should receive from the Postmaster-General, as a first charge on revenue from the issue of wireless receiving licences, an income adequate to enable it to ensure the full and efficient maintenance and development of the broadcasting service, and that any surplus revenue should be retained bythe State which safeguarded the listener against exploitation and exercisedregulative powers without which broadcasting would be thrown into chaos.7. In July 1926, the Postmaster-General announced the Government &apos;acceptance of the substance of the Crawford Committee&apos;s recommendation^The Commission, renamed the British Broadcasting Corporation, was&quot;established by Royal Charter on the 20th December, 1926, for a period often years from the 1st January, 1927. A. Licence and Agreement to cover the same period were concluded between the Postmaster-General and theCorporation, laying down the conditions under which the Corporation would operate and defining the percentages of the licence revenue which theCorporation should receive.8. In April 1935, towards the end of the life of the first Charter, thePostmaster-General announced the appointment of a Committee, under theChairmanship of Viscount Ullswater, to consider the constitution, controland finance of the broadcasting service and to advise generally on the con-ditions under which the service, including broadcasting to the Empire,television, and wire broadcasting, should be conducted after the31st December, 1936.9. After a thorough investigation, the Ullswater Committee in its report(Cmd. 5091) endorsed the general principles which had guided the Corpora-tion in the conduct of the broadcasting service, and recommended the renewal of its Charter, with some modifications, for a further ten years. Thereport recommended that a senior Minister without heavy departmental responsibilities should answer in Parliament on matters of general broad-casting policy, the Postmaster-General remaining, responsible for thetechnical conduct of the service; this recommendation was later rejected by the Government on the grounds that allocation of responsibility to a senior Minister would imply an increased control over the day-to-dayactivities of the Corporation and would lead to an undesirable division of responsibilities between two Ministers. Further notable recommendations by the Ullswater Committee were that Empire and television services shouldbe expressly authorised.10. The Government announced in June 1936 (Cmd. 52.07) that theyhad accepted the main recommendations of the Committee, and the charter and the accompanying Licence and Agreement were renewed, with appro-priate modifications and extensions, for a further period of ten years(Cmd. 5329). Less than three years of this period had elapsed when thenormal progress of British broadcasting was interrupted by the War.II. Renewal of the Charter11. The existing Charter, and the Licence from the Postmaster-General,expire on the 31st December, 1946. In preparation for that date, thequestion has been under consideration for some time past whether it wouldbe desirable to appoint an independent body, on the precedent of theUllswater Committee to advise the Government, but the circumstances do not
appear to render this course necessary. The Charter and Licence of-1937have been in force for less than four years in all under peace-time conditions and the Government have decided that the issues involved are sufficiently clear to render a new committee of enquiry unnecessary. They do notconsider that a new enquiry could add anything of substance to the exhaustiveinvestigation conducted by the TJllswater Committee in 1935.12. The Government have considered whether the British broadcasting corporation should continue to be the only body licensed to originate broad-casts in this country, since, if it is agreed that a single national broadcastingorganisation is desirable, there is no evidence of any widespread desire for aradically different type of organisation. It has been argued that the existing system places too much power in the hands of a single corporation, anddeprives broadcasting of the advantages of healthy competition. The Govern-Jfcient are, however, satisfied that the present system is best suited to -the^circumstances of the United Kingdom. Where only a limited number ofsuitable wavelengths is available to cover a comparatively small and densely-populated area, an integrated broadcasting system operated by a public corporation is, in their opinion, the only satisfactory means of ensuring thatthe wavelengths available are used in the best interests of the community,and that, as far as possible, every listener has a properly balanced choice of programmes. Co-ordination and the planned application of resources,rather than their dissipation, is, moreover, in the opinion of the Government,likely to lead to the greatest advances both in technique and programmes.Finally, the Government are satisfied that the record of the British Broad-casting Corporation during the twenty years of its existence fully justifiesits continuance. The Corporation has no doubt been open to fair criticism from time to time; and, indeed, criticism and constructive suggestions from parliament, the public, and the press are desirable. But taken as a whole,the achievements of British broadcasting since 1926 will bear comparisonwith those of any other country. Both the Government and the. Corpora-tion are fully alive to the advantages to be derived from the spirit of competition in broadcasting, and in order to encourage this, the corporation is actively pursuing a policy of enhancing the status of its individualregional organisations, and fostering a spirit of emulation throughout theservice, with the object of developing a number of vigorous regional bodies,each with a staff drawn largely from the region which it serves and each with a distinctive programme policy in keeping with the character of the region and the needs and wishes of its people. In the circumstances, theGovernment propose that the Corporation should continue to be the soleorganisation licensed to conduct a service of public broadcasting in Britainand that its Charter and Licence should be renewed, with such alterationsas are discussed later in this paper, for a further period of ten years fromthe 1st January, 1947.III. General Provisions Governing the Conduct of Broadcasting Services13. relations  between the Government and the British broadcasting corporation rest formally upon its incorporation by Boyal Charter and onthe Postmaster-Generals powers under the Telegraph and wireless telegraphy Acts 1863 to 1945. While under both these heads the Govern-menfs control over the Corporation is in the last resort absolute, they have,in peace-time, allowed the Corporation complete independence in the day-to-day management of its business. This practice is in accordance withthe views of the Crawford Committee which recommended that, while thePostmaster-General would be responsible to Parliament for all broadquestions of policy and finance, the Corporation should not be subject to[31996] o*
continuous Ministerial guidance and direction, which the Committee thoughtwould discourage enterprise and initiative, but should have the fullest liberty,within well-defined limits, to conduct the service. This policy was adoptedwhen the Corporation was set up, and has been consistently followed inpeace-time by successive Governments. It was endorsed by the UllswaterCommittee, which was convinced that no better line of demarcation betweenthe responsibilities of the Government and of the Corporation could befound. The Government see no reason to alter that policy which they believe to be the one best calculated to ensure freedom of expression onthe air and to remove from the party in power the temptation to use theState&apos;s control of broadcasting for its&apos;1 own political ends.14. The objects of the Corporation, its powers and its organisation areprescribed in its Charter (Cmd. 5329), while the terms and conditions under-which it operates are set out in the accompanying Licence and Agreement&apos;,,between the Postmaster-General and the Corporation. The Corporation^Licence contains not only provisions complementary to those of the Charter,but also confers the authorisation required under the Wireless TelegraphyActs for the working of broadcasting stations. The provisions of the Licencemay conveniently be divided into three groups : those governing the technicaloperation of the stations, dealing with such matters as siting, power andwave-lengths; those which relate to the revenue of the Corporation and-certain other financial matters (dealt with more fully in Section F of this paper); and provisions relating to the character and conduct of broadcasting-services themselves. There is an overriding clause reserving the right ofthe Government to take over and operate the Corporation^ stations in timeof emergency.15. Apart from a general obligation to observe the International Tele-communication Convention and any International Convention relating tobroadcasting to which the United Kingdom may be party, there are fourprincipal conditions broadly governing the character and conduct of theservice. The first prohibits the broadcasting of commercial or sponsoredprogrammes except with the written permission of the Postmaster-General.The second provides that the Corporation shall broadcast for Home and empire audiences during such times as the Postmaster-General shallprescribe. The third provides that the Corporation shall broadcast any announcement or other matter which a Department of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may require. The fourth states that the Postmaster-Generalmay require the Corporation to refrain from broadcasting any matter, eitherparticular or general.16. The clause requiring the Corporation to broadcast Governmentannouncements has been applied principally in relation to such matters aspolice notices and outbreaks of animal diseases. The clause contains aprovision permitting the Corporation to announce that any such item issent at the request of a named Department.17. The power vested in the Postmaster-General of prohibiting the broadcasting of a particular item has never been formally exercised, althoughremaining as an ultimate sanction. Under his power to prohibit the broad-casting of any class of matter, the Postmaster-General issued certain general,instructions to the Corporation, at the time of the first Licence: firstly, thatit should not broadcast its own opinion on matters of public policy, and,secondly, that it should not broadcast on matters of political, industrial orreligious controversy. The first prohibition was regarded as essential in apublic service with potentially so wide an influence, and has been maintained.The second prohibition was withdrawn by the Postmaster-General in 1928,
leaving the Corporation to exercise its discretion in permitting broadcastson controversial subjects, in the belief that the Corporation would ensure -that such subjects would be treated with complete impartiality. TheGovernment of the day made it clear that they held themselves free tomodify their decision in the light of experience, but the present Governmenthas no desire to exercise this right. The arrangement has worked well inpractice and has shown clearly the value of introducing a controversialelement into broadcasting programmes.18. During the war, most of the Postmaster-General&apos;s powers in non-technical matters under the Licence were transferred to the Minister ofInformation. In assuming these powers, the Minister of Informationdisavowed from the outset any intention to take over the administration ofMhe Corporation or to become responsible for its entertainment programmes.! The Corporation agreed that it would accept the direction of the Governmentin all matters affecting the war effort.19. On the dissolution of the Ministry of Information on the31st March, 1946, the powers under the Licence reverted to the Postmaster-General. As the Prime Minister announced in the House of Commons onthe 7th March, 1946, the Postmaster-General will be responsible for the broadcasting Vote and in the ordinary course Questions in the House ofCommons on broadcasting will, in present circumstances, be answered bythe Assistant Postmaster-General. The Prime Minister went on to saythat Questions on major broadcasting policy should be addressed to him.Since then the Prime Minister has asked the Lord President of the Councilto exercise this responsibility on his behalf. As a general rule, therefore, theLord President will answer Questions on major broadcasting policy unlessthe matter at issue is clearly within the province of one of his ministerialcolleagues.IY. Miscellaneous Provisions20. The Government intend to ensure that the Governors of the Cor-poration are as representative as possible of the public which they serve, andare convinced that the importance of broadcasting makes it essential thatthe Corporation should be controlled by the best possible talent. It is onthe Governors that the Royal Charter jolaces the responsibility for developingand exploiting the service &quot; to the best advantage and in the national interest,&quot; and it is to them that the Director-General and all other officers. of the Corporation are responsible for their actions. In exercising this responsibility it is the Governors&apos; duty to take an active interest, not onlyin the programmes, but also in the financial and staff policy of theCorporation. The current Royal Charter provides that, out of the revenues of the Corporation the Chairman of the Governors shall receive a salary o:t 3,000 per annum, and the Vice-Chairman and other members of the Board 1,000 per annum. The&apos; Government has given careful consideration tothe appropriateness of these salaries. They are satisfied that there is noreason to alter the salary either of the Chairman or of the Vice-Chairman,but they feel that while the duties of the other members of the Board are highly responsible the call which these duties make on their time is notsuch as to justify payment at the rate of  1,000 per annum. they accordingly propose that, when the Charter is renewed, the salaries of othermembers of the Board should be fixed at  600 per annum.21.   The Government attach great importance to the part which broad-casting   can   play   in   keeping   the   public   informed   of   parliamentary proceedings, but they are opposed to the broadcasting of actual debates[31996] c* 2
since they do not consider that the proceedings of Parliament lend them-selves to such treatment. Daily reports are already being given in theBritish Broadcasting Corporation^ programmes in addition to weekly talksby Members, and the Government have now laid upon the Corporation an obligation to continue to broadcast an adequate and impartial daily account by professional reporters, of the proceedings in both Houses of Parliament.22. The Government do not think it desirable to attempt to reduce towritten rules the principles which should govern the Corporation in regardto political broadcasting. It must be the responsibility of the corporation to maintain an impartial balance between political parties and in exercisingthis responsibility the Corporation will, no doubt, act in concert with therepresentatives of the political parties, as was done during the pre-Electionperiod in 1945 when the Corporation provided facilities to nominated^spokesmen of the main political parties and studiously avoided, in its*programmes, any expressions of political opinion.23. The Ullswater Committee made recommendations on the recruit-ment and terms of appointment of the British Broadcasting Corporation^staff, designed to prevent patronage and favouritism in selection, and toensure that members of the staff dealing officially with matters of controversy should maintain a degree of anonymity and impartiality similarto that expected from Civil Servants. These recommendations were accepted, and there have since been no important developments in this field which call for a reconsideration of the status of the Corporation^staff. The Government consider that, in staff matters, the corporation should retain the general independence which it now possesses, and Govern-ment control should be restricted to laying down broad limits of policywithin which it should work; nevertheless, the Corporation has beeninformed that, while it is not rigidly bound to relate the salaries andconditions of employment of its permanent staff to those ruling in theCivil Service, it should, in fixing such salaries and conditions, pay properregard to those of the Civil Service and to the greater security offered byemployment in a&apos; Public Corporation, as compared with employment inmost business concerns. The Government consider, moreover, that thereshould be adequate machinery between the Board of Governors and thestaff for &quot;the settlement by negotiation of terms and conditions of employ -ment with provision for reference to arbitration in default of such settle-ment in such cases as may be agreed; and for joint consultation regardingthe operational efficiency of the Service. They propose, therefore, that thenew Charter should impose upon the Corporation the obligation to consult with accredited representatives of such organisations representing the staff as appear to the Corporation to be appropriate, with a view to agreeing uponsatisfactory arrangements for this purpose.B. THE INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM OF WAVELENGTHS24. The number of separate broadcasting services which can be transmitted at any given time to Home listeners and the proportion ofthe total population which can be reached by these services, depend to alarge extent on the number of long and medium wavelengths available tothe British Broadcasting Corporation for the purpose.25. In broadcasting, as in other types of wireless communications, thewavelength used by any station must be protected from interference byother stations if effective service is to be given. Since stations may be capable of interfering with each other over great distances if they useidentical or neighbouring wavelengths, protection from, interference must
be organised internationally; and nearly all nations have adherecLto anInternational Telecommunication Convention, last codified at Madrid in1932. to which are annexed Regulations governing the operation of wireless services. These Regulations, which are normally revised at about five-yearly intervals, allocate groups of wavelengths to the various categories of wireless service, such as maritime services, fixed (i.e., long-distance tele-graph and telephone) services, aeronautical services, and broadcasting services. The use to which radio waves can be put depends on theirwavelength. Thus national and regional broadcasting services, involvingtransmissions over distances up to some hundreds of miles, require longand medium wavelengths; long-distance services over distances of thousands of miles can only be conducted on short wavelengths; while television and^frequency-modulated broadcasting services can only be operated on very*%hort waves which are normally suitable only for local transmissions oversome tens of miles. The number of wavelengths of any class that can bemade available to broadcasting is restricted by the requirements for wave-,lengths of other essential radio services.26. The distribution between the various countries of the wavelengthsthus -made available for broadcasting services so as to avoid mutual inter-ference can only be settled by further international agreement. This agree-ment is difficult to secure in practice because in broadcasting, as in otherradioi services, there are not nearly enough wavelengths to provide for allthe services which each country would like to undertake; and compromisemust be achieved in allocations which take account of the varying require-ments and considerations of the individual nations. If agreement werenot reached on an international basis and countries acted without co-ordina-tion, completely chaotic conditions, under which intolerable interferencewould be experienced between the services of one country and another, would inevitably follow.27. In the case of long and medium waves used for national and regionalbroadcasting services where interference may be caused over moderatedistances only, Continental agreements have been concluded under whichthe wavelengths available for such services are &quot;shared out among theclaimant nations. The present allocations in Europe are based on a planagreed by an international conference at Lucerne in 1933. Under this plan, wavelengths were allocated to each country in the European regionin order to enable it to conduct a national broadcasting service, the numberof wavelengths allotted to any one country depending on such considerationsas the population, area and configuration of the country, the number oflanguages spoken in multilingual countries, and the density and distributionof receivers.28. The Lucerne plan gave the United Kingdom the use of one longwave and ten medium waves, and also permitted it to operate transmittersof very low power on two further medium waves whose use is shared between a number of countries. While it proved impracticable to use these sharedwavelengths, on account of interference from stations in other countries,an additional medium wave allotted to Belgium but not then used by thatcountry was secured for use by the United Kingdom by bilateral agreement.29. Transmissions to countries outside Europe are made on short wave-lengths and it is expected that it will be possible, by international agreement,to retain sufficient short wavelengths to enable a number of programmes to be broadcast from this country simultaneously. The problem of how best to allocate these resources between the various foreign and Empireservices must be left for solution in the light of circumstances ruling fromtime to time.
C. THE HOME services . Transmitting Stations30. On its establishment&apos; in 1927, the Corporation took over from theBritish Broadcasting Company one long-wave transmitter of 25 kilowatts,eight medium-wave stations each of a maximum power of 3 kilowatts, andeleven auxiliary stations of low power.31. While these stations provided the main centres of population with one programme, the Corporation^ aim, progressively realised between 1927and 1939, was to give every listener in Britain, as far as technically possible,(a) an uninterrupted service throughout the day and evening, and (b) a selection between two alternative contrasting programmes, one national^and supplied mainly from London, the other including a considerable propor-tion of regionally produced material. A high-power long-wave transmitterbecame the mainstay of the National Programme and a chain of medium-wave stations curried the alternative or Regional Service. Some of the medium-wave stations were equipped with twin transmitters to increasethe area covered by the National Programme in addition to carrying thelocal Regional Programme.32. The power of the stations was progressively increased and by theautumn of 1939 the National Programme was carried by one 150-kilowattlong-wave transmitter and three medium-wave stations each of 20-50 kilo-watts; while nine medium-wave transmitters ranging in power from 60 to100 kilowatts, supplemented by four relay stations of lower power, formed a network, organised in seven distinct regions (London, West of England,Midland, North, Scotlaud, Wales and Northern Ireland), for the alternativeprogramme. Further increases in power have siuce been made to improve the audibility of the programmes in areas of difficult reception.33. Throughout the history of the Corporation, its engineers, working in close and cordial co-operation with those of the Post Office, have kept in the van of technical development and progress and no greater tributecould be paid to the technical excellence and reliability of their stations and equipment than to say that these have been extensively copied inother countries. The Government, however, attach great importance to improving the technical quality of the broadcasting services still further,and have welcomed the Corporation&apos;s proposal to spend a substantial sumeach year on research and development in broadcasting engineering and allied spheres. The Government also approve the Corporation^ intentionto press ahead with the development of frequency-modulated broadcastingon very short wavelengths as a solution to some of the reception difficulties caused by the limited availability of long and medium wavelengths, and hope that the radio industry will realise the importance of producing setsdesigned to receive this type of transmission.II. Wavelengths34. The distribution of the available twelve wavelengths in August 1989is shown in Appendix 1. The high-powered transmitter using the long wave,and several stations synchronised on one medium wave, carried the national programme. The remaining medium wavelengths were used for the RegionalService, two wavelengths each being used by transmitters in the West ofEngland, North and Scottish Regions while the remaining Regions (London,Midland, Wales and Northern Ireland) were each served by one wavelength.
35. On the outbreak of war, the separate National and Regional services were discontinued, mainly to avoid giving navigational aid to enemy aircraft,and a single Home Service was given to the whole country, transmitted by a number of stations synchronised first on two, and later on three,medium wavelengths. The degradation of service caused by this procedure in certain areas was alleviated in some degree by the provision of a numberof low-power auxiliary transmitters in densely populated areas. The home service was supplemented, in January 1940, by a Forces Programme,transmitted first on one, and then on two medium wavelengths and on short wavelengths for overseas reception. The remaining five Britishmedium wavelengths and the long wavelength were used for broadcasting,to Germany and other European countries. The Allied Expeditionary Forces^Programme, addressed to Allied forces in Europe, was added in 1944, beingtransmitted on a medium wavelength allocated under the Lucerne agreement to Latvia and Tunis, but not then used by the latter country (seeAppendix 1).36. After the end of the European war, in July 1945, a return was made towards the pre-war arrangements for the Home Listener. The National(now called the &quot;Light&quot;) Programme is again, as before the war, trans-mitted on the long wave and from synchronised stations on one mediumwavelength. The alternative programme, now called the &quot; Flome Service,&quot;was restored on a regional basis, but because of the continuing requirement of the European service for wavelengths, only eight medium wavelengthsare employed instead of the ten used before the war. This saving hasbeen effected by using only one wavelength for the Scottish Region, and bysynchronising one of the Northern regional transmitters and the NorthernIreland transmitter on the same wavelength. The two medium wavelengthsthus saved, supplemented by one additional medium and one long wavenot then in use by the countries to whom they were allotted under theLucerne Plan, were employed on the European Service. The allied expeditionary Forces Programme was closed down and the wavelengthpreviously employed for this service was transferred to the Flome Service,as the Belgian wavelength, which was used before the war, had been takenback by the Belgian authorities (see Appendix 1).III. Reorganisation37. The Corporation now proposes to make a third programme availableto the Home listener. This programme, which will at the outset be confined to evening periods, will be transmitted by one main transmitter situated atDroitwich, using a good medium wavelength and giving reliable reception upto one hundred miles from the station. This will be supplemented by anumber of low-power transmitters synchronised on one medium wave-length;and although there is a limit to the number of such synchronised stationswhich can be used without mutual interference, it is hoped that these will bring the programme to all towns of over 120,000 inhabitants which are out-side the range of the main transmitter at Droitwich. By these means theCorporation hopes to enable the third programme to be received effectivelyby about 80 per cent, of the population.38. Since the Government consider it essential to maintain theEuropean service and to continue to use at least two medium waves forthis purpose (see section D II of this paper) only one of the wavelengthsrequired for the third programme can be obtained by diverting it from theEuropean Service. The other wavelength will be made available by arearrangement of the Home Service, reducing the number of Regions from
seven to six by merging the West of England and Midland Regions&apos;into one(see Appendix 1). Any loss of range brought about by this reorganisationwill be largely compensated by additional low-power transmitters at Redruthin Cornwall and Bartley near Southampton, and by the erection of a newaerial system at the London Regional Station which will considerably increase its range. With the other regional services continuing unchanged, it isestimated that 94 per cent, of the population (approximately the same proportion as at present) will be able to hear the Home Service satis-factorily, although in certain small areas, for instance in parts of Norfolk,programmes intended for listeners in other regions will be received at betterquality and strength than those proper to the area. Similarly, listeners incertain areas of Northern England will continue to receive transmissionsfor Northern Ireland under more favourable conditions than those for the/North of England. These cases of &quot; cross-regionalisation,&quot; however, cannotweigh heavily against the advantages of introducing a third national programme, which the reorganisation will permit. Moreover, the improve-ment of the London Regional transmitter wall give substantially betterreception of the Home Service in South-East England. On the other hand,any reorganisation of broadcasting services must inevitably shift the boundaries of areas of poor reception and as a result there will be a deterioration-tion of reception in some areas, balanced by improvement in others. TheCorporation recognises the importance of affording a satisfactory standardof reception to the greatest possible number of listeners, and will be supported by the Government in pursuing technical investigations to thisend.89. The Corporation proposes, with the Government&apos;s agreement, tointroduce the third programme, with the consequent reorganisation of the regional services, in the autumn of this vear if possible, on the1st October, 1946.40. The Light Programme will continue, as at present, to be transmittedon a long wavelength, supplemented by low-power stations synchronised on a medium wavelength, covering about 95 per cent, of the population.IY. Programmes41. During the period of the first Charter, the Corporation steadilyexpanded both the number and variety of the programmes, and the total programme-hours broadcast per week in 1936 (including regionally-produceditems) was 169 as compared with 73 at its inception. This expansion con-tinued after the renewal of the Charter and the weekly programme-hours in respect of services for Home listeners reached 181 in 1939 and now standat 227.42. The selection of programme material to meet all tastes is an extremely difficult task, but the Corporation has endeavoured, by all themeans open to it of ascertaining the wishes of the public, to give all listenersa wide selection of the types of programme they desire, while preservinga reasonable balance between the various broad categories of programmes.Many of the Corporation s regular programmes, such ;as the SymphonyConcerts in the field of serious music, &quot;World Theatre&quot; and &quot;SaturdayNight Theatre&quot; in the field of idrama, their Information Services andBroadcasts for Schools in the field of education, &quot; ITMA &quot; in the field of light entertainment, &quot;The Week in Westminster,&quot; &quot; World Affairs&quot; andthe &quot; Brains Trust &quot; in the field of general interest are outstanding judgedby any standards: but of course it is not possible to please all tastes atany one moment when the choice of alternative programmes is limited.
43. The third programme will be mainly directed to the serious-mindedlistener, and will be used for such purposes as the broadcasting of plays,concerts and operas in full. Although its introduction will not mean the elimination of such items from the other two programmes, listeners will normally have a wider choice of contrasting programmes during the eveningperiods of listening than is possible at present. The Government are satis-fied that, when the new service is in full operation, the British listener willbe able to receive a wide variety of programmes ranging over the whole field of literature, science and art. The existing methods by which the Corpora-tion keeps in constant touch with listeners&apos; views and requirements will bemaintained.44. The Government have considered the use by the Corporation ofCommercially sponsored programmes, and do not consider that there is acase for any change in the present policy of prohibition. The Corporationhas shown no desire to use sponsored programmes, and any attempt to doso, they consider, would be resented by a large body of public opinion. Suchprogrammes would also be out of keeping with the responsibilities of theCorporation as the trustee of a Public Service. The Government, moreover,intend to take all steps within their power, and to use their influence withthe authorities concerned, to prevent the direction of commercial broadcaststo this country from abroad.Y. Growth of Home Listening45. The improvement in the broadcasting services, and the increasingly important part played by them in the life of the nation, is reflected in the steady increase in the number of wireless licence holders. During the periodof the British Broadcasting Company, this number increased from about35,000 at the end of 1922 to over two million at the end of 1926. At the expiry of the first Charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation the figure had risen to nearly eight million, and by early 1946 it had passed theten million mark, so that about four households in every five now have a wireless receiving licence. (A table showing the number of licences issuedyearly from 1922 to 1945 is given in Appendix 2.)D.-THE OVERSEAS services . Services to the Empire46. Experimental shortwave broadcasts from this country to oversealisteners began in December, 1927. The results were sufficiently satisfactoryfor plans for an Empire Broadcasting Service to be drawn up by the british broadcasting Corporation and to be submitted to the Colonial Conferenceof 1929 and to the Imperial Conference of 1930. A regular service to theDominions and Colonies was inaugurated in December, 1932, beginning witha ten-hour daily service in English, sent out from two short-wave transmitters.The service was gradually expanded, and reached eighteen hours a day in1939. New high-power stations and new aerial systems improved its efficiency and arrangements were made with Commonwealth broadcasting organisations for&apos; the relaying of selected programmes from London by their domesticbroadcasting stations.47. At the outbreak of war, the Empire Service became a world service,enabling listeners in all parts of the globe to hear frequent news bulletinsand talks in English, giving the British point of view on current events.Later, to satisfy the needs of British and Allied troops overseas for news
and entertainment, a General Overseas Service and General Forces Pro-gramme were introduced, broadcast throughout the twenty-four hours ofthe day. Assistance and facilities were also afforded to Dominion and AlliedCommands for broadcasting to their troops stationed in this country.48. The Government consider it essential that the Empire Services ofthe Corporation should be maintained and developed in co-operation with theDominions, India, and the Colonies. The wavelengths available for these services should bo used to the greatest advantage and should be supplemented by the transmission of programmes over overseas telephone circuits forrebroadoasting locally, and by the export of programmes in the form ofscripts and recorded material. They consider that move emphasis shouldbe laid on programmes of interest to individual member countries of theBritish Commonwealth. The Government have, informed the Corporationthat they approve, and wish it to continue, its practice of employing staff&apos;with a background Dominion experience in its programme departments and,where possible, of making arrangements for a periodic interchange of staffwith the Dominion broadcasting authorities. In order to maintain the reciprocal nature of these services, the Government hope that the Dominionbroadcasting ^authorities will bo encouraged to develop more programmessuitable for United Kingdom audiences, which could be accepted by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation for rediffusiou in the services for Homolisteners.II.-Services to Foreign Countries49. In October. 1937, after other countries, notably Germany, hadembarked on extensive schemes of broadcasting to listeners in foreigncountries in their own languages, the Government of the day decided, inaccordance with, a recommendation of the Ullswater Committee, thatbroadcasts of news in foreign languages should lie started, without detriment to the development of the Empire Services. The Government consideredthat the Corporation should have the same full responsibilities and duties,as set out in its Charter, for the Overseas services as for the other services.50. The foreign language services began early in 1938 with Arabicbroadcasts to the Near East and with programmes in Spanish and Portuguesefor Latin America. A service lor European listeners was inaugurated duringthe Munich crisis in September. 1938, with a speech by the Prime Minister,Mr. Chamberlain, which was translated into French, German and Italian.Mews bulletins in those languages then continued daily throughout the crisis.Prom thai date onwards the scope of foreign broadcasting increased rapidly,particularly after the outbreak of war. Many new transmitters were speciallybuilt and brought into service, including the largest short-wave station, andrite most powerful long-wave transmitter, in the world. Xews bulletins weresupplemented by commentaries, talks, music and feature programmes, so arranged as to give, as far as possible, an early morning and midday bulletinin each language as well as a fuller evening programme. More frequenttransmissions were given in the principal European languages. facilities were also given to Allied Governments in exile for broadcasting to their ownpeoples, and to hue United States Office of War Information for relayingAmerican broadcasts to Europe An American Broadcasting Station(A.B.S.LB.) was also established in this country and obtained transmittingfacilities from the British Broadcasting Corporation. These activitiesreached a peak in the summer of 1944. when the Corporation^ own foreignlanguage services to Europe amounted to 37 programme hours a day in24 languages. At that time, the total volume of broadcasting to overseasaudiences was over 130 hours a day in 46 languages.   A reduction took place
after the end of hostilities in Europe and again after the victory over Japan,with the result that at present foreign language broadcasts to Europe totalabout 26 hours a day out of an aggregate of just over 100 hours to overseasaudiences in all.51. The important part played by the Corporation^ Overseas broad-casts, in creating and maintaining goodwill towards this country during thewar, is universally recognised. The Corporation&apos;s services to the occupied countries of Europe, in particular, were of the greatest value in sustainingthe morale and spirit of resistance or the people. In some cases, the broadcasts became an effective link between the leaders of the resistancemovements and their followers, as, for example, when one of the leadersof the Danish underground movement recorded a speech at his secretheadquarters, the records were smuggled out of the country and the voiceof their leader, broadcast from London, shortly afterwards called the peopleof Denmark to further action. Instructions from the Supreme Commander,Allied Expeditionary Force, were regularly broadcast in the Corporation^European Service and helped to make the efforts of the people still underNazi domination an integral part of the Allied assault on their oppressors.Expressions of appreciation for the help given by broadcasts from thiscountry, have been received from many foreign Governments, broadcasting and other organisations, and from countless individuals in every part ofthe world.52. Apart from direct transmissions to foreign audiences the Corpora-tion, originally at the request of the Government, supplied records of programmes to stations Overseas. These recordings, supplied in english and 19 foreign languages, are transmitted by local stations in all parts ofthe world, thus bringing British programmes to large numbers of listenerswho cannot receive them direct.53. The rebroadcasting of such programmes and the relaying oftransmissions direct from this country by stations overseas have been greatly facilitated and stimulated by the efforts of Corporation representa-tives permanently stationed in Australia, Canada, India, the Middle East,the United States, and Latin America.54. Another war-time development of the overseas services was theestablishment of an agency to keep a check on the output of broadcasting stations in foreign countries. During the war the Corporation^ MonitoringService listened to iu million words a day in thirty languages, extractedimportant news and intelligence material and made it available to theBritish and Allied Governments, to the Corporation for its own news pro-grammes, and to the Press. With the restoration of communications with most parts of the world, the scope of the Monitoring Service has been considerably reduced, but it still provides a valuable means of obtainingnews and information.55. The Government have considered the future of the foreign languageservices, and have come to the conclusion that, in the national interest andin order to maintain British influence and prestige abroad, it is essentialthat many of the services should continue. Conditions have, of course,changed with the advent of peace, and the European Service, for example,cannot expect to retain the enormous audience which it built up for itselfduring the war. In the first place, it is normally not technically possiblefor transmissions from this country to Europe to compete with the standards of audibility achieved by locally-situated Continental stations, and european listeners no longer have the strong incentive to listen to Britishprogrammes that they possessed under the German domination.   Moreover,
now that the national broadcasting systems of the Continent have regainedtheir independence, it must be assumed that many listeners will be content to take from them the news and comment on current events for whichthey were forced to rely on this country during the war. Nevertheless theEuropean Service rotains a large audience and friends of this country onthe Continent are anxious that it shall continue. Moreover, there are clearindications, at present, that other Powers intend to continue to use the broadcasting medium to put their point of view before the Europeanaudience and we cannot afford to let the British viewpoint go by default.To continue the European Service effectively requires the use of at least two medium wavelengths on high power in addition to short wavelengths.The Government consider it essential that out of the medium wavelengthsavailable hi this country, two should be set aside for this purpose. ^56. The Government consider that the Overseas Services of the Corponv.tion should continue to be conducted in the most effective manner possible,consistent with economy in money, manpower and wavelengths; and that every endeavour should be made to secure the acceptance by overseas broad-easting authorities of as many of the Corporation^ programmes as possiblefor rediffusion over their national networks. Such programmes, reaching the Overseas listener with as high a standard of audibility as his own pro-grammes, can do much to promote an understanding of British life and customs. The Government would also welcome acceptance by theCorporation of suitable foreign programmes for rediffusion in the services for Home listeners. As far as the content of the Overseas Service isconcerned, the Government consider that great care should be taken toensure the complete objectivity of the news bulletins which will form thekernel of all Overseas broadcasting. The Corporation^ reputation for tellingthe truth must be maintained, and the treatment of an item in an Overseasnews bulletin must not differ in any material respect from its treatment incurrent news bulletins for domestic listeners.5% The Government intend that the Corporation should remainindependent in the preparation of programmes for overseas audiences, thoughit should obtain from the Government Departments concerned such informa-tiou about conditions in those countries and the policies of His Majesty sGovernment towards them as will permit it to plan its programmes inthe national interest.E. TELEVISION5S. Experimental television broadcasts started in this country as far-back as the autumn of 1929. and in August 1932 the British broadcasting corporation afforded facilities to Baird Television Limited for publicexperimental transmissions of low-definition television (30 line) from itsLondon Station at Broohmans Park.59. Other systems of television began to emerge and in May 1934 aCommittee was appointed, under the chairmanship of the late Lord Selsdon,*&quot; to consider the development of television and to advise the Postmaster-General on the relative merits of the several systems and on the conditions under which any public service for Television should be provided.&quot; after receiving a considerable volume of evidence, inspecting various televisionsystems and sending delegations to the United States of America andGermany, the Committee submitted its report (Cmd. 4793) to the Postmaster-General m -January 1935.   Its principal recommendations were:  (ar) that a public television service of high definition operated by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation should be established;
17 186(b) that the Postmaster-General should appoint an Advisory Committeeto plan and guide the initiation and early development of theservice;(c) that an initial station in London should at the outset operate on thesystems of Baird and Marconi-E.M.I. alternately;(d) that the aim should be the establishment of a network of stationsoperating on a national standardised system of transmission;(e) that at the start the cost of the service should be borne out ofbroadcast receiving licence revenue.60. The Government accepted these recommendations and a regularpublic high-definition television service, the first in any country, wasinaugurated in November, 1936, at the British Broadcasting Corporation^Ration at Alexandra Palace. The Baird and Marconi-E.M.I. systems were1 used alternately until February, 1987, when it was decided, on the recom-inendation of the Advisory Committee, that the Marconi-E.M.I. system(405 lines) should be employed alone in future.61. By 1939 the service had reached a high standard; the programmetechnique had made great progress, and the result was a service ofconsiderable entertainment value. Plans were under consideration for theextension of the service to the Provinces, but before further progress couldbe made the television service was closed down for military reasons onthe 1st September, 1939.62. In September, 1943, a Committee under the chairmanship ofLord Hankey was appointed &quot; to prepare plans for the reinstatement anddevelopment of the television service after the war.&quot;63.   The main recommendations in its report* were:  (a) that the Minister responsible for sound broadcasting should also beresponsible  for  television  and   that   the  British  Broadcasting-Corporation should continue to operate the service;(b) that an Advisory Committee should again be appointed;(c) that the London service should be restarted on the pre-war standardof definition and that this standard should also form the basisof plans for an extension of television to provincial centres;(d) that vigorous research should be initiated with a view to the introduc-tion of an improved system approaching the cinema standard ofpicture definition and possibly incorporating colour and stereoscopiceffects;(c) that two types of special television licences should be introduced for domestic viewers and for cinemas respectively.64. The recommendations of the Hankey Committee were accepted in substance by the Government in October, 1945. A Television AdvisoryCommittee was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. G. M. Garro Jonesto advise the responsible Minister on television policy, with particular reference to the following points :  (a) the planning, after consultation with the industry, of the futuretelevision service, including the standards to be adopted;(b) the co-ordination, and where necessary the initiation, of research into the principles and practice of television;(c) the encouragement of pooling of television patents and their use inthe national interest;* Report of Television Committee 1943: published by His Majesty&apos;s stationery office, 1945.
(d) the investigation of all developments in television, at home andabroad, including its use for cinemas, bearing in mind theimportance of the export trade and the desirability of the adoptionof international television standards.The Committee contains representatives of the British Broadcasting Cor-poration and of all Government Departments directly concerned with thedevelopment of television from the financial, supply, technical and scientificpoints of view. The Committee meets frequently to consider and report tothe Postmaster-General (as the Minister now responsible for broadcasting)on all the problems connected with television as they arise. It alsomaintains close liaison with the radio industry and, as necessary, other interests concerned with various aspects of the development of the television service.  65. The London television service was reopened by the Corporation onthe 7th June, 1946, and urgent consideration is being given to the difficult problems involved m extending it to the Provinces.F. FINANCE66. The Corporation was financed up to the war by the payment to it of a sum representing a stated percentage of the net licence revenue be., the receipts from the issue of wireless receiving licences, less the costs of their issue and of the associated services undertaken by the Post Office(consisting of accounting, enquiries and prosecutions in respect of unlicensedsets, and investigations and advice to the public in regard to electrical inter-ference with broadcast reception). These costs amounted to 9 per cent, of receipts during the years immediately before the war.67. Various alternative methods of financing the broadcasting services in this country, such as by the use of sponsored programmes, special dutieslevied on manufacturers of sets, or on imported receiving sets, an additionto general taxation, and so on, were examined in detail by the SykesCommittee of 1923 but were rejected for reasons which still hold good inall essential respects. The licensing system has the merits of simplicity,fairness and ease in administration and the financial arrangement basedupon it directly relates the expenditure on the broadcasting services to theamount collected from listeners.68. The existing Licence and . Agreement between the Postmaster-General and the Corporation provides (Clause 20) that the corporation should receive in each year a sum equal to 75 per cent, of the net licence revenue, but provision is made for an increase in this percentage if theCorporation shows that the amount thus made available is insufficient inany particular year for the adequate conduct of the service. That situationdid., in fact, arise before the war, and an increase of 8 per cent, was granted in 1937-38, which was raised to 15 per cent, for 1938-39, thus bringing theCorporation^ proportion of net licence revenue to 90 per cent. There were clear indications that, even under pre-war conditions, the continuingdevelopment of the Corporation^ services would necessitate still largerexpenditure in subsequent years, with the result that the stage was imminent where the total licence receipts would have been insufficient tomeet the cost of those services.69. During the war, however, the normal arrangement had of necessity to be- set aside, since national requirements imposed such heavy expenditureupon the Corporation as far to outstrip the revenue from the issue of licences.
The Corporation has accordingly been financed by. Grants-in-Aid, the amountof which has, during the past three years, been at a rate of over  8 millions per annum.70. With the return to peace-time conditions, the Government consider this procedure no longer appropriate, and it is proposed that at the end ofthe present year there should be a reversion in principle to the pre-warmethod. The Corporation will again receive as a first charge on the ne trevenue from the issue of licences an income adequate to enable it to ensurethe full and efficient maintenance and development of the broadcasting and television services, and, if necessary, the whole of the net revenue fromlicences will be made available to the Corporation for this purpose.71. The level of the Corporation^ expenditure on the Home servicesJin ring the new Charter period can be estimated only broadly at this stage,Hout it is expected that the cost of the Home sound broadcasting services under conditions of normal post-war development will soon rise to the orderof  7J millions a year. This is a very considerable increase over the pre-warcost hut takes into account the higher standards of service which listenersin this country may rightly expect to receive in post-war years, the general increase in prices and the extension in the daily hours of broadcasting,including the addition of the third programme which it is the Corporation^intention to provide later this year. For example, the Corporation intends,by the end of 1946, to increase the number of hours of programmes broadcastweekly for reception by Home listeners by about 50 per cent, over the pre-war level. The average cost of each hour of programme, in turn, is expected tobe almost double the pre-war level, on account of a number of factors suchas the greater complexity and variety of programmes, higher fees to artists,greatly increased engineering costs arising from the larger number and muchgreater power of the transmitting stations, and the generally increased levels of salaries and wages.72. In addition, the cost of the television service, as far as can beestimated at present, is likely soon to reach about  2 millions a year.Initially, the cost of this service will not be covered by the proceeds fromthe issue of the special television licences, and the cost of the service duringthe development period will have to be met to a substantial extent from the proceeds of ordinary sound broadcasting licences. The Government considerthat this course is justified, since the development of television will ultimately be of direct benefit to a substantial proportion of broadcasting licensees.73. In the circumstance, the Government have raised the annual charge for wireless receiving licences from 10s. to  1 for the reception of soundprogrammes only, and have issued a new licence covering the reception of television and sound programmes for domestic use at an annual charge of  2.Consideration is being given to the conditions which should apply in the caseof licences for the reception of television programmes in cinemas and other places where a charge is made for admission.74. The Government have given very careful and sympathetic considera-tion to the impact of the increased wireless licence charge on people of smallmeans, such as old age pensioners, widows in recept of pensions, and so on.They have reluctantly come to the conclusion, however, that it would be impracticable to try to adjust the charge to the varying means of listeners,and that the cost of administering such a scheme would be prohibitive inrelation to the annual sum involved. The new charge of  1 a year represents a cost of only two-thirds of a penny per household per day, which is a verysmall sum in relation to the value given in the wide diversity of programmesavailable to the listener from early morning until late at night.   For those
who might otherwise find difficulty in meeting this charge, facilities arealready available through the Post Office for the accumulation of small sums of money (which may be withdrawn at any time) by the purchase of savingsstamps which are sold in 6d. units.75. While the number of licences which may be taken out in future years cannot be predicted with certainty, it is expected that the total revenue from the new licences will be about  10 millions per annum initially andthat the yield will grow as the television service is developed and extended,and the number of television licences increases.76. Although the levels of expenditure for the Home sound broadcasting and television services forecast in the preceding paragraphs will not bereached in the immediate future, the indications are that the provisionnecessary for these services will soon absorb practically the whole of th^net licence revenue.77. The Government have decided that financial provision for allOverseas broadcasting services, whether directed to the Empire or to foreigncountries, and including their ancillary services, should take the form ofan annual Grant-in-Aid to the Corporation from public funds, so that thecost of these services will not be a charge against wireless licence revenue.The present cost of the Overseas services is about  4 millions per year andthe amount of the Grant-in-Aid should be adjusted from year to year tomeet the cost of the operation by the Corporation of Overseas services ofa character and on a scale approved by the Government.78. During the period of the new Charter, financial provision in respectof the services conducted by the Corporation will be made as hitherto inan annual Vote for broadcasting, for which the Postmaster-General willbe responsibleG. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS79. The conclusions reached by the Government are summarised below:  The Charter(1) The issues involved are sufficiently clear to render unnecessary anew enquiry by an independent Committee into the conduct ofthe broadcasting services.

APPENDIX 3WIRE BROADCASTING1. In a wire broadcasting system, broadcast programmes are picked up at a central point, either by the use of very high-grade wireless receivers, or, in somecases by means of direct lines from a convenient point on the cable network whichthe Corporation leases from the Post Office for its normal programme distribution ;the programmes received by these methods are then distributed to individualhomes by specially provided wire lines. The central receiving point, with itsassociated network of distribution lines, is known as a &quot; relay exchange.&quot; Thesystem avoids the need for a separate wireless receiver in each home, the onlyequipment required in most cases being a loud speaker and programme-selectorswitch.2.   Each subscriber, before he can be connected to a wire broadcasting system a ,is required to be in possession of the usual annual wireless receiving licence in* ,addition to paying a rental to the owner of the relay exchange for the facilities provided, including the hire of the loud speaker and the use of the lines.3. The Illlswater Committee recommended in 1936 that the Post Office should undertake the unification and co-ordinated development of wire broadcasting inthis country, together with the ownership and operation of the relay exchanges,for which it had been granting special licences to private proprietors since 1927.The Government of the day came to the conclusion that this recommendation shouldnot be adopted immediately in view of the many practical and technical considera-tions involved, and that it&apos; woidd be expedient that the system of licensing privateconcerns to conduct relay services should continue for a further period, duringwhich the Post Office could undertake technical and practical experimental work.The licences to operate relay exchanges were accordingly extended to the31st December, 1939, and a programme of research and experiment was put inhand by the Post Office.4. Before any final conclusions could be drawn, however, the growing iuter-national tension and eventually the outbreak of war necessitated the reconsider a-tion of the whole matter; and it was decided that the existing relay exchangelicences should be extended to the 31st December, 1949, and that any new licencesgranted should be terminable on the same date. The experimental work in handby the Post Office was suspended; and, during the war, shortages of materials andlabour made it necessary also to suspend the issue of new licences to privateundertakings.5. The existing concerns gained a substantial number of new subscribers duringthe war, largely because of the difficulties of direct wireless reception in manydistricts under war conditions; the scarcity of domestic receiving sets, components and batteries; and the shortage of servicing electricians. At the present timesubscribers to relay exchanges number some 650,000 (i.e., about 6J per cent, of thetotal number of holders of wireless receiving licences), as compared with 260,000at the outbreak of war, and are served by 274 separate relay exchanges.6. All licences issued to relay exchange undertakings can be determined,subject to a year&apos;s notice, on or after the 31st December, 1949, and provide thaton their expiration the Postmaster-General may acquire by purchase all or anypart of the plant and apparatus of the licensee for a sum equal to the value atthe date of purchase, exclusive of airy other consideration.7. The Government have considered the future of wire broadcasting in thiscountry and have deferred a decision on the question of public ownership and operation of wire broadcasting services pending a further review nearer the date on which the licences held by the relay exchange proprietors are terminable.Wt.- 6/46 F.O.P. 31996 Gp. 340
