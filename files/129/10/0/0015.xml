THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT   ,/Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1946. &quot; % 3SECRET. Copy No.     6 8CP. (46) 215.24 A June, 1946.CABINET.NOTES ON SOME OVERSEAS ECONOMIC AND PUBLICITYPROBLEMS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I have already reported to my colleagues (in OP. (46) 202) on my mission to the United States and Canada. There are, however, a number of wider points which have impressed me since my mission, and may also be of interest.2. First, I am much concerned over the piecemeal and untidy state of theinternational machinery for handling the supply and economic side of winningthe peace. During the war these aspects were taken care of by the structure of combined Boards geared up to the Combined Chiefs of Staff and through themto the United States and United Kingdom Governments at the highest level.Strategy and policy were therefore decided in the light of a continuous andaccurate knowledge of resources, and decisions reached were immediately trans-mitted through the combined machinery to all the agencies of the two governments and wherever necessary to their opposite numbers representing other united nations Governments. All this has gone by the board and such relics of combinedmachinery as remain (notably for food) are accordingly crippled in their operation.No doubt in due course the long-term post-war structure of U.N.O. will fillpart of the gaps, while as shortages are overcome the need for inter-governmentalmachinery will be correspondingly reduced. At the moment, however, we arein an interregnum which is seriously threatening the winning of the peace. Onthe food front the new International Emergency Food Council may meet theneed, provided that it is given a really strong secretariat including some first-rateBritish personnel and provided that it can develop a compact and effective centralsteering committee. But even on the best possible assumption, the fight againstfamine will be hampered by the absence or inadequacy of corresponding arrange-ments covering supplies of equipment and incentive goods and possibly transport,and the weakness of the machinery for dealing with coal. I cannot go into more detail here, but I suggest that the new Steering Committee for international organisations should be instructed to review the field and report to Ministers assoon as possible.3. On the publicity side great advantages would follow if the economic arrangements for dealing with the transition period could be more clearly defined and explained in a simple and convincing way. Bodies such as the european coal Organisation, the European Central Inland Transport Organisation andthe Emergency Economic Council for Europe are virtually unknown to thegeneral public, apart from occasional conference reports; and we are hampered by not being able to point to any structure which the ordinary man can graspand which looks like meeting the obvious and compelling needs of the transition period. In view of the sacrifices which people will have to accept throughoutnext winter here and elsewhere, I think we should have publicity plans ready and I am asking the Overseas Information Services Committees to take this aspect up.4. In Washington and New York I received the impression that we are missing many American publicity opportunities, especially now that the intenseunpopularity of the Russians and our attitude in India, Egypt and elsewhere[320111
are creating relatively the most favourable atmosphere which we have had therein time of peace. I was extremely well served by the skeleton team available during my visit, but it was desperately thin on the ground. With impendingreinforcements I hope we can take the initiative and clear away bogies such as british Imperialism, which cost us so much in practical ways and which couldbe tackled now with real hope of success. Again, an incident like the notoriousMacDermott denials on the food agreement shows the importance of being strong enough on the publicity side to cover the State Department and other agenciesas closely as the scale of our interests at stake requires. It is not altogether amatter of numbers quality is more important in this field.5. I was very much impressed by the excellence of the British team work-on economic matters in Washington, but at the same time by the precariousnessof our situation. We have extremely few officers left there with real experience and contacts, and those few are melting away week by week, through the naturaldesire to repatriate those who have been out some time, through return to non-Government service, and for other reasons. No doubt this has been inevitable in the immediate post-war phase, but a new stability is badly needed now. i suggest that Ministers with representatives in Washington should watch this aspect very carefully in future. We cannot afford to see our representation thereor our provision for backing them up at the London end further weakened either in number or in quality. In fact, some increase in strength may well be necessary,as it clearly is in the case of food at this moment.There is also a continual danger that with insufficient staff economic co-ordination will suffer through too many people being out at meetings or in transit. During the war we had a branch of the Cabinet Office in Washingtoncalled the British Civil Secretariat. Now that this has been disbanded it isimportant that the Embassy should be appropriately staffed to do this job andto keep the Information side continuously posted on developments. The cost of I&quot;being caught short in this key field at this key point in the world may be very heavy.6.   What has been said about Washington to some extent applies to Canadaalso.  We are going to remain tremendously dependent on the maximum support Ifrom Canada in all sorts of ways, especially during the next two years, and we i cannot do too much to convince tne Canadians that we are aware of their problems Iand of the risks and difficulties they are facing to help us.   Unfortunately, thefact that we do not have to argue so hard with the Canadians as with the americans to secure their understanding and co-operation is apt to mean thattheir goodwill is taken for granted, and there is a dangerous accumulation of 1minor disappointments and grievances which must be closely watched.   For this Ireason it is particularly opportune that the Minister of Food has been able to Itransact such important business in Ottawa in connection with the wheat 1-agreement.7.   In conclusion I would refer to the growing importance of arrangements for transport and accommodation of Government representatives on missions Ioverseas, if full value is to be got out of their visits.  I suspect there may be a Itendency for these matters to be put into the hands of officers overseas who arenot considered suitable for other work, or alternatively for such arrangements to be left to administrators and diplomatic representatives who are already over-&quot;burdened with policy matters.   I suggest that the aptitude and adequacy of staffdealing with these points and the system for avoiding difficulties should be given jeven further attention by the Treasury and others concerned, in view of the 1difficulties and embarrassments which any lack of effectiveness here can create.II. M.   1Office of the Lord President of the Council,24th June, 1946.
