H. H.Colonial Office, 24th June, 1946.General Sir A. Cunningham to Secretary of State for the Colonies,dated 17th June, 1946.(No. 982.)FOLLOWING is text of communication from Jewish Agency in reply to request of His Majesty&apos;s Government for their views on the recommendationsof the Anglo-American Committee : &quot;The Jewish Agency for Palestine have made abundantly clear in theirmemoranda and oral submissions to the Anglo-American Committee of Inquirytheir views on the inseparable problems of Palestine and the Jewish people andthe reasons for their conclusion that the only just, practicable and lasting solutionof those twin problems is the establishment of Palestine as a Jewish state. these views and reasons remain valid and unaltered. The Jewish Agency&apos;s memo-randa and oral submissions are doubtless available to the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and the United States of America; a copy of their principalpolitical memorandum is attached for ready reference.2. The Jewish Agency note the Committee&apos;s condemnation of the basicprovisions of the White Paper of 1939. They would urge the authoritiesto carry out with the utmost despatch the Committee&apos;s recommendations that 100,000 Jewish victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution be permittedimmediately to enter Palestine and that the discriminatory and restrictiveLand Transfers Regulations in force in Palestine be rescinded and replaced by a policy of freedom in the sale and lease of land irrespective of race,community or creed. They hope that the Governments of Great Britain and theUnited States as well as the bodies indicated by the Committee will co-operatewhole-heartedly in the tasks of transport and resettlement involved.3. What has happened since the publication of the Committee&apos;s report has, however, given rise to serious misgivings and perturbation among Jews inPalestine and throughout the world, who see cause for grave concern in the[32012]
hesitation and delay shown in implementing these positive recommendations ofthe Committee. The  act that Jews are still confined to displaced persons campsa year after the defeat of Germany and the continuing deterioration in theposition of the Jews in Europe makes such procrastination indefensible.. 4. After the primary recommendation of the Committee that the first100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe be enabled to reach Palestine immediatelyhas been implemented in good faith, the Jewish Agency will be fully preparedto discuss with the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United states the various aspects of the problems of Palestine and the Jewish people and any matters arising out of the recommendations of the Committee.&quot;Copy of memorandum referred to under paragraph 1 follows by air mail.8
