(4.6) 217*The attached report has been submitted by the Chiefs ofStaff in pursuance of the above conclusion.2.. The Defence Committee, at their meeting on the1hth June -(a) Endorsed the conclusions set out in paragraph 29of the Annex, namely -&quot;(a) The policies of complete withdrawal,  orwithdrawal&apos; by a certain date are alreadyeliminated by Cabinet decision, and thepolicy of appeal to U.N. 0.  would provide no solution to the immediate problem.(b) A policy of withdrawal into Pakistan wouldnot only fail to safeguard our strategic interests,  but would inevitably lead to civil war in India, a situation which wouldbe completely unacceptable on military grounds(c) A policy of remaining in the whole of India andfirmly accepting responsibility for law andorder would result,  if the Indian Armyremained loyal, in an acceptable military commitment and would safeguard our long termstrategic interests.The total loyalty of the Indian armed forces is admittedly open to doubt, but we believethat this would largely depend on the firmnesswith which the situation is handled and onthe  terms in which we announce our intentionto remain.If, however,  the Indian armed forces did not remain loyal we are informed by the localauthorities that we would be faced with thenecessity of providing five British divisions for India, with the consequent abandonment of commitments in other areas hitherto regardedas inescapable,  serious effects on our import&quot;and export programmes and world-wide reper-cussions on the release scheme.      The  only alternative to this would be ignominiouswithdrawal from the whole of India.&quot;

(b) Invited, the Chiefs of Staff to prepare plans tomeet the situation which would arise if the worst case envisaged in policy (c) above wereto arise.      The Defence Committee emphasised the vital importance of secrecy in the preparationof these plans.(c) Invited the Ministry of Transport to prepare plans for the early evacuation of United Kingdomcivilians from India on the basis that such action if it became necessary, would be given priority over all personnel movements other than thoseinvolved in military movements related to the reinforcement of India.(d) Agreed,  in principle&quot;,  that no further women andchildren should be embarked for India whilethe present situation existed, and invited theMinistry of Transport and the India Office toexamine the practicability of applying this principle forthwith,,3.

C (46)  68        J12TH june.  1946.cabinet defence COMMITTEEINDIA - MILITARY IMPLICATIONS OP PROPOSEDCOURSES&quot;OP ACTIONReport By the Chiefs of StaffBoth the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy in theirappreciation4&quot; of the possible course of future events inIndia,  stress the urgent need for an indication of thepolicy which His Majesty&apos;s Government would adopt should thepresent negotiations Break down.    They consider that ifserious trouble does arise,  it might come with littlewarning and might assume very serious proportions.      promp action would Be required to deal with it, with very little time for consultation with London.2,      The Cabinet Mission consider that if the negotiationsdo in fact break down and wo are faced with serious internaldisorders, the situation can only be met by the adoption ofone of the five following courses:-(a) Complete withdrawal as  soon as possible.(b) Withdrawal by a certain date.(c) App ea1 t o U.N.0.(d) Maintaining overall control throughout India,(e) Giving independence to Southern and Central India,and maintaining the existing position in North-West and North-East India.We have been asked, to give  the military implications ofthese courses of action.3.      We would emphasise that, due to the short time available,bur appreciation&quot;has perforce Been prepared without consultationwith G.H. Q.   India,Basic Factors4.      In cohsidering the military implications of our future policy with regard to India, v/e must bear in mind&apos; that in any future war our strategic requirements in India are that she should. Be a main support area,   (i. e.  we should Be in a positionto have recourse to her industrial and man-power potential)and. that we  should, he enabled to use her territory for operational send administrative bases, &quot;and. air staging posts.* Circulated as CP. (46)  217,

It is, therefore, Important that India should &quot;be secure both from external aggression and internal disorder. For defence purposes,  it is essential that she should remain a single unit.In addition,  the Viceroy has stated that:-(a)    Our short term policy is  to give India self-Government as quickly as possible without disorderand chaos breaking out.(h)    We.must maintain law and order in any part of india for which we retain responsibility for government.Furthermore, we must protect British lives and property throughout India.(c) We- have certain moral responsibilities towards the minorities throughout India.(d) We must at all costs avoid a situation in which wohave to withdraw from India under circumstances ofignomy after t;ht;re hove been widespread riots and attacks on Burcpeans,  and we cannot accept any course which could be represented as a policy of &quot;nouttie&quot;or which gives  the appearance of weakness.(e) Wo must not allow ourselves to be placed in theposition of helping Congress to coerce the Moslemprovinces.In deciding our short term policy,  full weight must begiven to these factors,  in particular,  to the need for safeguarding our long-term strategic interests&apos;;;Elimination of first three  courses proposed by Cabinet Mission.5,      The Cabinet have expressed the opinion that a policy of complete withdrawal, either with or without a time limit, wouldbe very undesirable;    further,  such a policy would do nothing to safeguard our long-term strategic interests.As regards an appeal to U.1T. 0.  apart from political objections,  this course would have the disadvantage from themilitary point of view,  that we should be left to maintain our position in India while negotiations with U.N.O.  are inprogress.    This course would therefore provide no solution tothe  immediate problem.Wo therefore do not consider it necessary to examine further the military implications of any of the above courses.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING A POLICY OFMIMINING IN INDIAInternal Political Factors6.      The Congress Party can rely on wholehearted support in theCentral Provinces, United Provinces, Bihar, Orison, and or some support in Bengal, Bombay Presidency and Madras.    A mass ruove-raent sponsored by Congress would be extremely hard to put downand might involve considerable bloodshed.    In the event of serious disturbances sponsored hy Congress it is probable that\wi could count on the support of the Moslems.The Sikhs, are the most important of the minorities since they occupy a key position in the Punjab (a predominantly MoslemProvince;  and  can bo dangerously violent.    Their sympathies,insofar as they have any for either of the principal parties,tend to align them, more closely with the- Hindus.    They are animportant elembfit in the Indian Army.

-  , . The Viceroy points out that the great mass of theInoian people are  anxious for peace,  and will support theGovernment in its maintenance of law and order provided it shows itself firm and resolute.    These people,   so long asthey remain in any doubt as to their future, however,&quot;areunlike openly to support us,  and they may be swayed into action against us.Indian St a tes7.      The attitude of the States will,  in our opinion,  be influenced primarily by what they consider their future statuswill be in India.     It is unlikely that the States will beanti-British during a period of widespread disorder, but theassistance which we can expect from them will be considerably less if our policy appears,  in their eyes,   to be one ofy/e akne s s.The larger native states all possess local armed forces,and are less likely to be involved in communal strife than british India.    Although we cannot count on the use of these local forces outside their own states,   ,,e should hope to beable to use base facilities,  airfields,  etc.,  in certainstates,  and there is not likely to be any heavy guardingcommitment.North-West prontier8.      It is likely that the tribes on the North-West Frontierwould take advantage of any weakness of the frontier garrisonand follow their hereditary predatory instincts to raid,across the administrative border into the North-West frontier province.We have no evidence of Russian military activity on theAfghan border at present.    We  consider it unlikely that shewill adopt aggressive tactics towards India until she isassured of a strong position on the Persian Gulf and untilshe has allayed the distrust of the Moslem world.The Foreign Office have requested that we should considerthe possibility of Russia being able  to organise Communistforces which would menace the frontier.    Material is availablein the area for exploitation by the Soviet Government anddisorders and risings in Afghanistan can be easily engineered,he consider,  however, that the Russians will play a waitinggame in this respect until such time as they consider it suitstheir policy to do otherwise.&quot;1&quot;   The danger of Russian inter-vent ion in this manner would,  in our opinion,  increase if weshow weakness in dealing with the Indian problem,  or if there-is a lack of unity in its defence.IMPLICATION OP REMAINING III THE WHOLE OF india.     This course will hove the following advantages :-(a) India will be kept under control.    We should run the  risk,however,  of permanently antagonising the Indiansas a whole, which would militate against our long-term strategic interest.(b) We shall be carrying out our responsibilities as regardsthe safeguarding of minorities.*    J.I.C.   (b,6) 38 (0)

(c) Our capacity for dealing with trouble onthe North-West Frontier would not be prejudiced by the disruption of the indian army which would occur under Pakistan.(d) We  shall keep open our communications withthe Kingdom of Nepal.10.      On the other hand, we should remain responsiblefor the whole of India and must therefore be prepared tomaintain law and order throughout the country.    A resolutepolicy from the outset la essential and might preventtrouble growing and spreading,  but in the last&quot;re sort wemust be prepared to use force  and to proclaim martial law.Our ability to maintain law and order depends largely on the  loyalty of the Indian armed forces.Reliability of the Indian Armed Forcos11,      l/e  consider that,  in general,  the reliability ofthe Indian Armed. Forces to act in aid of civil power inthe event of widespread, communal and anti-Governmentdisturbances depends-on the security of the future of &quot;individuals  at present  serving in the Forces.    Regardingthose units of primarily combatant arms if they feelthat they can rely on the British and that they will notat some time in the future be dependent on a CongressGovernment for their&apos; livelihood, or not become answerablefor any action committed under British command,  they arelikely to do their duty.    Since we foresee no possibilityof being able to implement any guarantees which it would,he desirable to give them regarding their future security,unless we were  to remain in India for a prolonged period,we consider that the reliability of the Indian Army as awhole,  Including those in garrisons outside India is opento serious doubt.    This even applies to Gurkha units.An early announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government would continue to employ Gurkha units would largely increasethe chances of them remaining loyal.The Royal Indian Navy and Royal Indian Air Force cannotbe regarded as reliable.    There  is some danger that the elements of shore establishments in the former1 may be actively hostile,  but disaffection is more likely to takethe form of a mere refusal of duty.    A few units of theR.I.A.F. may be depended on, but ground crews, particularlyin or near large towns,  are unreliable.As regards forces stationed, on the North-West frontier,both the  Indian Array and the R. I.A. F.  would probably do their duty as they will be remote from the scenes of anti-Government disorder.lie i nf orcement s Re quiredShould Indian Armed Forces remain loyal12.      To deal with internal disorders,  Commander-in-Chief,India, has estimated that he would require(a)    British forces now in the country to beretained, at their existing strength.In particular, the proposed run down inBritish infantry battalions to a totalof 15 would have to be halted.    This would entail a serious additional man-powercommitment.-A-

(b) Reinforcomerit by three brigo.de groups(2 Inf.  Diy.. less one bde.  end 31 Inf. Bde).(c) Reinforcement by five sir transport squadrons.Further,  he is of opinion-that the despatch of reinforcements to India before the outbreak of disturbanceswould tend to aggravate the situation.     &quot;Therefore,  we propose  to invite the War Office to prepare plans so  thatthe retention of forces in (a) and reinforcements in (b)above can be.put into effect at short notice if they arerequired.    With regard to (c) above,  the necessary warningorder has already been issued.Should the Indian .^rmed Forces Become disaffected.13*      In India.    The Gommandor-in-Ohief has estimated, thatwe should require:-(a) To hold key areas.British forces at present in the  country andreinforcements detailed in paragraph 12 above.(b) To restore the situation.In the worst case of widespread disorders somefour to five British Divisions,  in additionto those detailed, in (a)  above.The administrative backing required for these cannot be assessed, without a reference to India, but it may be verycons ider able.14*      Outside India.    The British formations which (nightbe required to replace Indian troops would be:-(a) In Malaya and Burma(i)    Six British brigades.(ii)    The administrative organisation for their maintenance,(b) In Hong; Hong and JapanTwo British Brigades.(c) Two battalions in the Dodecanese and threebattalions in Iraq,We consider that it would, be essential to relievedisaffected Indian units in Burma, Malaya and Iraq, but that wecan afford to take a risk as far as Indian units in Japan,Hong Kong and the Dodecanese are concerned;!,If   necessary, we suggest- that the Dominions mightbe asked to assist as regards Japan.15,      Total reixif orcements requiredIn the worst case we should therefore    require in additionto tho reinforcements given in paragraph 12 above:-(a)    Five British Divisions for India.(.b)    Six British Brigades for Burma and Malaya and threebattalions for Iraq.(c)    Administrative troops for India, Burma and. Malaya.

Sources of Rslnf-orcemehts and Impligati90s16.      The sources from which reihf or cements , additional tothose in paragraph 12, might be provided, and the implications are considered below.      In the case of the Armyt,  these implicationsare more fully discussed at Annex,Spurees of Reinforcements17. (a) Middle Mast............... One DivisionThe maintenance of existing British forces atpresent strengths, the provision of five air transportsquadrons, and the provision of administrative troops wouldhave repercussions on all theatres.Implications of providing British Reinforcements&quot;I fri If Indian-. Forces remain - loyalThe necessary reinforcements have already been earmarked(2nd Infantry Division less one Brigade   . 31st infantry brigade send, five air transport  scruadroris&apos;)&apos;.i9. If&quot; Indian Forces become disaffected(i) Middle Mast.      There would be insufficienttroops to deal with the serious disorderswhich might result when a decision en theAnglo-American report on Palestine isannounced;  or in the event of an unsatisfactorytermination to our negotiations for an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.(ii) Greece.

Our forces would virtuallybe halved, with consequent repercussions on our tasks in the country,(v) All administrative services in India,and to a great extent those in S.E.A.C. ,are manned, by Indian personnel.     It isclear, therefore that the- administrativeimplications will be very serious.     a review of the problem would have to bemade in con junction with G.II.Q. , India.(b) Greece,(c). Italy ,(d.) GermanyTwo divisions one Division and seven BrigadesOne Division(a) Army

(b) Naval.      All naval forces at present stationed in theIndian Ocean would have to be retained in the area;    inaddition, considerable naval reinforcements would berequired in order to assist in maintaining internal security in the ports, and if necessary,  to assist inevacuating civilians.      These forces would also provide an insurance against active hostility on the part of theR.I.N.      The provision of these reinforcements would seriously prejudice the ability of the Navy ti meet itscommitments in other theatres.(c) R.A.N.      The five R.A.P.  transport squadrons  required t*reinforce India would cut down the remaining commands by50 per cent,  of their medium range transport.      Thiswould dislocate their internal scheduled services and seriously affect their other transport arrangements.    Inaddition, the maintenance of these;squadrons in india would take up a considerable portion of our trunk routelift, as owing to an acute Shortage of spares it wouldnot be possible to pre-stock India with the requiredspares.      Furthermore , owing to the present high, rate of release of air crews it will be necessary to invoke themilitary necessity clause for aircrews of there info rc ing squadrons.(d) Release and Morale.      The maintenance of the existing units in India a ^&quot;present strength, and the provision of reinforcements would make&quot;it necessary to stop release  inthe Army formations concerned.      It is for consideration whether   in the interests of equality of treatment, wewould not be forced as a result, also to suspend releasethroughout the Army and the other Services.      these measures would have considerable effect on morale.(e) Movement.      If a decision were taken on the 15th Juno itwould, be possible for the leading brigades with their essential vehicles  to arrive in India before the end ofJuly.      The movement of the five divisions to India wouldbe complete, on a reduced scale of transport, by mid-October.The provision of the necessary freight shipping would have serious effects on both the import and export programmes,and would involve the loss of approximately 110 dry cargo ships for one voyage to India.The necessary personnel shipping could be provided at thecost of a corresponding reduction in present plannedmovement of military personnel.      It would, however,  benecessary to postpone the planned release  of troopshipsfor reconversion and to suspend the movement of Britishcivilians, other than those  returning from India,.for two to  three months.      If,  in addition,  it were necessary tomove six brigades from Germany to Malaya and Burma,  themovement would continue for at least a further month.This assumes that the evacuation of European civiliansfrom India to b.K.  would be  in progress concurrently with,the movement of roinforcoments.53  .-2f Implications of Maintaining our Position in India.If, therefore, it is decided to adopt a policy of maintainingpposition throughout the whole of India,  it is necessary that i-either (a)  the Indian Array should, remain loyal;or (b)  the British, reinforcements, summarised above,should be forthcoming:.have already stated that the reliability of .Indian forces iswi to serious doubt.      By relying on their integrity we mightil find ourselves in. a situation from which we should do forcedwithdraw under circumstances of ignominy, since we would already declared our intention of remaining in India.

We have  set out the serious implications of providingBritish reinforcements, and thorp- availability would haveto he dependent on a political decision to abandon commitments in other areas, hitherto regarded as inescapable.IMPLICATIONS OF WITHDRAWIHG INTO PAKISTAK21. The advantages of a policy of granting independence to Hindustan and of maintaining our position in the&apos; areasof 1T.W.  and P7.B. India, constituting Pakistan, would beas follows: -(a) We avoid the risk of being involved in helping the Hindus to coerce the Moslems.(b) This policy is consistent with our promisesto the Moslems.(c) Congress will be disarmed of their principalweapons of sabotage and civil disobedience.(d) Responsibility for the administration ofHindustan would tend to steady the moreirresponsible elements of Congress andthus might deter them from encouragingviolence against us.22. On the other hand, it is extremely unlikely thatthe Congress Party would agree to this proposal since it,in effect, amounts to setting up Pakistan, to which theyhave always been violently opposed.     Even if, however, theydo not actively oppose our withd.rawal the implications wouldbe as follows:-(a) It would bo necessary to re-organize theIndian armed forces.      The Array iscomposed partly of class units (i,e.  thosecontaining men of the same religion) whichare all Hindu.      The remainder is in mixedunits (i,e, containing both Moslems andHindus).      In the event  of India beingsplit, therefore, it would, be  a matter ofyears, even in peaceful conditions, before an effective army could, be formed in pakistan,      This would, be equally aoplicableto the R.I.N.  and the R.I.A.F.(b) This proposal would, result in a divisionof India and this would undoubtedlyprejudice the sotting up of a central administration to deal with defence, andin turn prejudice the future security ofIndia against external attack.(c) Should. Hindustan insist on the withdrawalof Hindu troops from outside India, weshould be obliged to:-(i) withdraw from N.E.I. and. the Dodecanese;(ii) provide an administrativeorganisation for Burma, and Malaya.I. n addition,  the Briti sh troops atpresent held, in Malaya as a reserve for India would be absorbed in garrisonduties in the former country.

There would probably &quot;be a temporaryIBSoutbreak of raiding from the tribes - - &quot;on the ITorth West frontier,  consequent on the disorganization of the indian forces in this area.finally,  the Implications of dealing with the problemof minorities will be extremely grave,    This is discussed fully in paragraph 2d below,23. If Congress decides actively to oppose our withdrawalwe should, be faced not only with the above, but also with thefollowing:-(a) We should have to undertake a military task orgreat difficulty and danger in evacuating all british civilian and military personnel fromHindustan,    This would, involve the provision,of British, reinforcements *    The extent ofreinforcement necessary could only beaccurately assessed after reference to G-.H.Q,.,,India,, but we estimate that it would, bo cons icier-able.    The implications of providing those forces would, be comparable to those summarised inparagraph 19 above,(b) The task of sorting the Indian Forces would bemade almost impossible.(c) The efficiency of units on the North west frontier would be likely to deteriorate rapidlywhich would probably result in more serious and prolonged, raiding by the tribes.(d) Oommuni cat ions across India would l*e cut and our ability to use the Gurkhas would, be curtailed,due to the severance of commuhicatfons withNepal.Minorities2h. In. Pakistan and especially in the; Punjab, there would bea large and. militant Hindu minority and. communal trouble in theform of serious riots could be expected in the ares, which, would,be under our control. Congress would have a direwt interest inthese people.In Hindustan,  there would be no guarantee of the fairtreatment of the Moslem minorities.    Even if there were no ill-treatment there would, bo bound to be wild, and inflammatory rumours&quot;which would add. to onr&apos; difficulties- in Pakistan.We consider that these two factors taken in conjunctioncould not but end in civil war and we should, be involved notonly iii fighting with Hindustan^ but aloe in serious communalstrife in parts of Pakistan where there wore Hindu minorities,where British troops would be the only effective armed, force.We have not bo-en able to assess the forces required tomaintain law and. order un.iJ.or these circumstances, without reference to Oomm.-uid.er-.iJ w&apos;Urief ,  India.Summary23, To sum up, a policy of withdrawal into Pakistan wouldnot only fail to safeguard our strategic requirements but would inevitably lead in the course of time, to civil war in. India.Should Congress actively oppose our withdrawal to Pakistan, war would bo precipitated..    This policy would, thus be completelyunacceptable on military grounds.

REMOVAL OF BRITISH CIVILIANS FROM INDIA26.    The Cabinet Mission have proposed&quot;1&apos; that an emergencyplan should be worked out in consultation with G. H.p.   india for the removal of United Kingdom civilians from India inView of the very considerable risks  to which Europeans maybe exposed.     It is impossible to prepare a plan untilinformation is available as to the numbers which would be involved in such an operation.    The India Office state thatan -estimate can only be given after consultation with India.27. &apos;  It is,  however,   clear that such an evacuation wouldcompletely dislocate the planned movement of both the Servicesand Civilian personnel for a considerable period.    Since suchan evacuation would only be undertaken in the event of the active hostility of Congress resulting in the defection ofthe Indian Army, we consider that the plan should be prepared on the basis that the evacuation of civilians would&apos; be given priority over all other personnel movements except thosedirectly related to the provision of British reinforcements for India.28.    The Cabinet Mission have also pointed out that it wouldhe very helpful if immediate steps could he taken to expedite the passage of women and children in India now awaiting returnto the United Kingdom.    The India Office have estimated that by the end of July there will be a considerable number ofpersons in this category&apos;&quot;.     From the military point of vie1./,it would not be justified,  under present circumstances,  toInterfere with the planned movement of service personnel.    Weconsider, however,   that the provision of passages for women and children awaiting return to  the United Kingdom might wellbe given priority over all other civilian movement,   since their evacuation would reduce our military tasks in india should the situation deteriorate.We understand that numbers of women and children arestill being embarked for passage to India.    We consider that,&apos;at the same time as steps are being taken to expedite thereturn of women and children to this country,   the India office should be invited to ensure that no further women and children are despatched to India while the present situation exists.To -prevent alarm,  these measures will necessitate a careful].y prepared cover plan.4-    Index 6l, paragraph 25.

CONCLUSIONS29.    We conclude that:-.The policies of&quot; complete withdrawal,  or withdrawal by a certain date are already eliminated by cabinet decision,  and the policy of appeal to U, N.0.would provide no solution to the immediate problem.A policy of withdrawal into Pakistan would not onlyfail to safeguard our strategic interests,  but&apos;   would inevitably lead to civil war in India,  a situation which would be completely unacceptableon military grounds.A policy of remaining in the whole of India andfirmly accepting responsibility for law and order would result,  if the Indian Army remained loyal,in an acceptable military commitment and wouldsafeguard our long term strategic interests.The total loyalty of the Indian armed forces is admittedly open to doubt,  but we believe that this,would largely depend on the firmness v/ith which thesituation is handled and on the terms in which weannounce our intention to remain.If,  however,   the Indian armed forces did not remainloyal we are informed by the local authorities thatwe would be faced with the necessity of providing fiveBritish divisions for India,  with the consequentabandonment of commitments in other areas hithertoregarded as inescapable,  serious effects on our import and export programmes and world-viderepercussions on the release scheme.    The only alternative to  this would be ignominious withdrawal from the whole of India.30.    On the subsidiary issue of the repatration of women andchildren,  we conclude that:-(a) The plan for the evacuation of United Kingdomcivilians from India should be prepared en thebasis that such action,  if it became necessary,would be given priority over all personnel movementother than those involved In military movementsrelated to the reinforcement of India.(b) Action taken to expedite the passage of women andchildren awaiting- return to the United Kingdom shouldnot under present circumstances interfere withplanned service personnel movement, but should have priority over all other civilian movement.(c) No further women and children should be&apos;embarked forIndia while the present situation exists.(S i signed)    ALANBROOKF,j. h, d. cxmsmmmTEDDER(a)(b)(c)IJOffices    of the Cabinet and minister of Defence,  S.

ANNEXIl^^LilidJCATION5 CF INOViDING ABMY RjjINrORCIfl-DJNTGICE INDIAIRCDLEM1 . To provide the Army reinforcements which would bonecessary to restore the situation in India should widespreaddisorders break out and the Indian Army become disaffected.For this purpose, Field Marshal Auchinleck has stated that four to five- divisions might be required in India, inaddition to the 2nd-Division less one brigade, and the 31 stInfantry Brigade,      To replace disaffected Indian units in burma and Malaya would require six brigades and the necessary administrative organization to support thorn.      We have leftaside the problem of relieving the two Indian Brigades in hong Kong and Japan, as the problem is already of suchmagnitude that the relief of these brigades can be considered in a lower priority.ASSUMPTIONS2. We have assumed that :-(a) Initial ReinforcementsThe 2nd British Division, less one Brigade,and the 31st Infantry Brigade would be movedimmediately large scale trouble had broken- out,under arrangements which we are inviting theWar Office to make with Theatre Commandersconcerned.(b) Time FaatorThe four to five British Divisions required -forIndia over and. above-the force in (a)  above should be complete in India as soon as possible after the1st July,(o) Personnel movement must bo timed to arriveWith the minimum of their&apos; essential vehicles.lOSSIBLD SOURCES OF REINFORCEMENT3. (a) The only strategic reserve at present is the13th Brigade.Group in Germany which is at14 days notice to move.(b) Other -formations which might be madeavai 1 a bl e ar e; -3rd British Division from Middle Bast,4th and 13th British Division,-; from Greece(15th Division is without Divisional Troops).6th Armoured Division from Italy.We examine the implications separately.(*) The formations in (a)  and (b) above give an approximate total of four divisions.      To reach field marshal Auchinlock1s maximum of five divisions forIndia and to provide for replacing disaffectedIndian troops in Malaya and Burma we have,  therefore,also studied the implications of moving infantry-formations from Germany,--12-

IMPLICATIONS

Strategic

4. (a) Middle East. If the 3rd British Division, in addition to the 31st Infantry Brigade is moved from Middle East we shall be unable to deal with disorders which may result when a decision on the Anglo-American Report on Palestine is announced. We shall also have insufficient troops to deal with any serious disorder which might result from unsatisfactory negotiations for a new Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, and in addition, there will be no reserve to deal with any trouble which might arise in Tripolitania, entailing reinforcement in General Paget&apos;s estimation by one infantry division.

(b) Greece. It is at present the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to evacuate Greece if possible by September. The withdrawal of British forces from Greece would then be contingent upon the peace treaties restricting the size of Armies in the rest of the Balkans. Until satisfactory Peace Treaties have been made, or the Greek Forces are sufficiently strong, a minimum of one British Division will be required in Greece.

(c) Venezia Giulia. 6th Armoured Division is at the moment a reserve for 13th Corps in Venezia Giulia. If this division were withdrawn before the Peace Treaty has settled the face of this part of Venezia Giulia we would be unable to withstand a determined Yugoslav attack which might be made if the move of this armoured division were taken by the Yugoslavs to mean a withdrawal from the present stand we have taken. It is unlikely  that we shall be able to obtain any extra forces from the Americans as a reserve to replace this Division. In any event it is probable that the Combined Chiefs of Staff would object to withdrawal of 6th Armoured Division since they have already agreed to this Division forming part of the reserve in the event of Yugoslav aggression.

(d) Germany. Our forces in Germany would virtually be halved, and it has already been appreciated that the Forces now in that country are the minimum consistent with security and with our task of restoring economic life within the British Zone. Removal of even one Division, in addition to 13th Infantry Brigade would, therefore, have serious repercussions on the situation in Germany. It is difficult to see the practicability of moving more than one Division.
