(U6J 20=523RD MAY.  1 946PROPOSED  INCREASE IN CHARGES OF CONTROLLEDRAILWAYS AND L.P.T.B.Memorandum By the Minister of transport.      The Cabinet agreed on 16th May that,  subject to the limita-tion of the increase in freight rates (other than coal rates) to10 per cent,   of the pre-war level instead of 1673^,  the increases in railway charges proposed in CP. (46) 193 should be brought intooperation from 1st July, 19d6.2. I propose to announce in Parliament at an early date that the increases will be as followsControlled Railway Companies &amp; Joint LinesFares  (other than Workmen&apos;s &amp;.

Iwas authorised to increase the charges for goods train traffic,other than coal, by a further 10f: making in&quot; all 262/3tX,  over pre-war.      Such a percentage would create administrative difficulties and would give the impression of being a closely calculatedpercentage, whereas the increases now being made are  on verybroad lines.      I propose,  therefore,  to adopt a figure of 25%and the consequent reduction in yield in a full year is something over  1 m.      The annual yield of the increases which 1 now propose is estimated at about  31 m.COPY NO.CABINET
