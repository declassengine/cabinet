THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,.  June 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 216.   (Revise.)3rd June, 1946.CABINET.DESPATCH OF FAMILIES TO B.A.O.R.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.IN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet at their meeting on the6th May (CM. (46) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 4) I have reviewed, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, the proposals made in CP. (46) 147 for the despatchof families to B.A.O.R. in the light of the points raised when these proposals were considered by the Cabinet.2. The main point raised in the Cabinets discussion was whether, by givingmore frequent leave to men in B.A.O.R. or by allowing their wives to pay shortvisits to them, it would be possible either to avoid altogether the need to offer men with twelve months&apos; service or more to run in that theatre the option of having their families with them for the remainder of their service or at any rate to reducethe number of men who would take advantage of the offer.3. At the outset of our review we were satisfied by the information givenby the Service Ministers that the expense, disturbance and inconvenience involvedin any scheme for allowing large numbers of Avives and children to pay shortvisits to B.A.O.R. frequently enough to meet the demand must rule out this expedient. As regards the suggestion that the demand might be met by the grantof more frequent leave from B.A.O.R., the Service Ministers represented strongly that any such concession would lead to much discontent among the Forces in thosetheatres where leave arrangements are on the same basis as in B.A.O.R. andto even more discontent in theatres where the leave arrangements are already less favourable. It would, moreover, make additional demands on the man-power resources of B.A.O.R. which they could not afford to meet. We were, therefore,driven to the conclusion that there was no alternative to a scheme on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 147.4. We then considered whether it would be possible to limit the numbersof families despatched to B.A.O.R. (i) if the benefits of the scheme were restricted to men serving as regulars or on extended engagements or (ii) if more frequentleave were granted to men with twelve months&apos; service or more to run in B.A.O.R.On these points the views of the Service Ministers were that any discrimination between men serving as conscripts and men on regular or extended engagementswould be untenable in practice; and that the grant of more frequent leave, inaddition to being open to the objections referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, was not likely to make any appreciable reduction in the numbersof men wishing to take advantage of the scheme. We think that there is substance in these arguments and accordingly recommend that if the scheme is adoptedthere should be no attempt to restrict its benefits, beyond the limitation to thosewho have still twelve months&apos; service in B.A.O.R. before them. We have been assured by the Service Ministers that, so far as they can judge from what has happened in Austria, the number of men who will wish to have their families with them is not likely to be so great as to impose an undue strain on the facilities to be provided under the scheme. We also understand that it is the intentionof the Service Departments that a man who has his family with him shall beentitled to local leave in Germany only, except for leave on compassionate grounds,and it seems clear that many men will prefer to leave their families in the United[31932]
Kingdom and retain the right to two periods of nineteen days&apos; leave each year at home.5. The following subsidiary points were raised in the cabinets discussion : (a) if children were sent, would the scheme not make excessive demands onthe available supply of teachers and were there not in any eventserious objections to sending children to Germany, especially in thepresent unsettled conditions?(b) would the transfer of families to Germany for periods of a year or morenot lead to awkward housing questions in this country since localauthorities could not afford to leave houses empty and would nevertheless hesitate to requisition houses belonging to the wives of serving soldiers?6. On the first point we were assured by the Service Ministers, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and the Education Ministers that the 250 teachersrequired for the scheme could be supplied without undue detriment to the progressof education in this country, and that there was no reason to believe that theeducation of the children sent to Germany, who would be grouped in communitieson a two-battalion cantonment basis, would suffer. As regards the problem of security it will not in any event be possible to begin the movement of any familiesuntil August, by which time it is hoped that conditions will be more settled.7. With regard to the housing question, the view of the Service ministers and of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is that a family which has a house in the United Kingdom and is transferred to Germany should have nodifficulty in subletting their house furnished and that, on the whole, the scheme should relieve rather than aggravate the housing problem, since it will at theexpense of Germany provide accommodation and furniture during the critical period immediately ahead of us for a number of families who would otherwise be a charge on our resources. In these circumstances, the Minister of health and the Secretary of State forScotland do not wish to press the objections whichthey raised at the discussion in the Cabinet.8. In the foregoing paragraphs no separate mention has been made of thestaff of the Control Commission. We are, however, satisfied that their case for having their families with them is, if anything, stronger than that of men inthe Forces and we suggest that the same conditions should apply to them, subjectto the exception that staffs who have several years&apos; continuous service in Germanybefore them should not be deprived of leave to this country because they have their families living with them in Germany.9. We accordingly recommend that the Cabinet should give the service ministers and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster authority to undertake the necessary preparations for the scheme outlined in CP. (46) 147 and to announce that the scheme has been approved in principle, on the understandingthat the movement of families will not start until the three Service Ministers andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster consider that conditions in germany are sufficiently settled to justify bringing the scheme into operation.(Intld.)      A. G.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,3rd June, 1946.
