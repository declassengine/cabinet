(46) 56th Conclusions, Minute 3), 1 circulate herewith for theconsideration of my colleagues the report which I htwe prepared, setting out theconclusions which I have reached in regard to the present situation in the Ruhrcoal-field as the result of the discussions which I held with the Commander-in-Chief and his headquarters staff, with the officials of the North German CoalControl at Essen, with German mining engineers, trade union leaders, and individual miners during my recent visit to the British Zone which extendedfrom Wednesday, the 29th May, to Monday, the 3rd June.2. At the conclusion of my report I have indicated the action which, inmy opinion, we should now take to remedy the extremely serious situation disclosed.(Initialled) E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Potver,Millbank. S.W.1,19 th June, 1946.REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN THE RUHR,My object in visiting the Ruhr was to examine on the spot the reasons why it had so far proved impossible to restore the level of output of coal in the Ruhrand, in consequence, to satisfy the urgent demands for coal for reconstructionpurposes received by the European Coal Organisation from the European coal-importing countries. In particular I was anxious to ascertain what were thereal reasons for the significant fall both in output per man shift and in total output which occurred in the week ending the 3rd March last.2. The greater part of my discussions were accordingly with the officials of the North German Coal Control at Essen. At the same time I had discussions with leading German mining engineers in charge of large coal-mines and withsuch trade union leaders in the coal-mining industry as were now available. Itsoon became apparent that the lack of mining supplies forms a very important element in the situation, and I therefore had discussions both with the officials in charge of timber supplies and those in charge of steel production. Later Ihad the benefit of discussing the underlying economic problems with theCommander-in-Chief, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Sholto Douglas, who,on the following day, kindly arranged a conference which was attended by the deputy Military Governor, General Sir Brian Robertson, Sir Percy Mills, whois responsible to General Robertson for the operation of the civil departments ofthe Military Government, Sir William Strang, the Political Adviser to theCommander-in-Chief, and also by the heads of a number of the civil departments.[31992] BSECRET.CP.

The reasons for the loiv output of coal in the Ruhr.3. The conclusions which I have formed in regard to the fall in the outputof coal in the Ruhr may be summarised as follows :  (1) From the time of the arrival in the Ruhr of the Allied Armies in July1945 there was a steady increase in the output of coal (&quot; steinkohle&apos;!)from about 400,000 tons to about 1,051,000 in the week ended the23rd February last. In the same period output per man shift overallrose from 0-50 tons to 0-87 tons, though even at the latter figure itwas far below the pre-war figure of 1-55 tons when weekly output was 2-5 million tons.(2) The announcement at the beginning of March of a substantial cut in food rations led to an immediate fall both of weekly output and of output per man shift underground and overall. The output fell by10 per cent, to 938,000 tons, while O.M.S. underground and overallfell by 9 per cent, to 1 -10 tons and 0 - 80 tons respectively.(3) There is no doubt that even before this cut the total quantity of foodwhich a miner could get was insufficient to enable him to work hardthroughout his 8-hour shift, and it was for this reason that the mereannouncement that there was to be a further substantial cut in hisrations (from 3,400 to 2,800 calories a day) was enough to lead tothe set-back which then occurred.(4) There were falls both in weekly output and O.M.S. throughout March,the figures for the week ending the 30th March being: (5) There has since been a gradual recovery. Apart from holidays, weeklyoutput now remains at about 970,000 tons, with an O.M.S. overallof 0 - 85 tons.(6) Thus, O.M.S. (overall) has virtually recovered to the level obtaining priorto the cut in food rations, but weekly output is still about 80,000 tonsa week less, owing mainly to the cut in rations, for it is now notinfrequent for a miner to absent himself from work for as much asthree days on end, so that he can go into the country to try to getfood for his family from the farms on a barter basis, money beinguseless for this purpose.(7) More than half the rations given to miners (which are higher than thosegranted to any other class of heavy worker) is given in the form offood at pit-head canteens. Of the amount so supplied the bulk is inthe form of thick soup, which the miner eats before he starts hisshift; the remainder of the extra rations consists of two bread and margarine sandwiches which the miner is supposed to eat during his shift, but as often as not puts in bis pocket to take home to his family. There is clear evidence that many miners who eat the wholeof the meagre rations supplied at the canteen do so because they give up the whole or part of their ordinary civilian rations (1,014 caloriesa day) to help to support their families. Everyone is agreed that thelatter ration is in general being supplemented by the civilian population to the extent of 200 or 300 calories a day, in the country by home-produced food, in the towns by foraging in the countryside,and that, if this was not so, more acute signs of starvation would by now have appeared. It may be noted that in the concentration campsin the British Zone it was found that 1,014 calories a day was insufficient to prevent starvation and the ration had to be increased.(8) Although all the fit men are put to the face and even haulage and other work underground is performed by men not classed as fit, there isan acute shortage of face-workers. Theoretically there are powersof directing men into the mines, but there is no labour registered asunemployed in the Ruhr itself (though there are reasons for thinking that, in hopes of better times, industrial employers are holding on to more labour than they can now profitably use) and in consequence theonly way of obtaining extra labour for the Ruhr mines is by directingTons.Output ...O.M.S.

to this men from the agricultural districts of Hanover and Sehleswig-Holstein. Owing to the larger amount of food obtainable in these districts, such labour is most unwilling and desertions are frequentand on a large scale.(9) There is no general appreciation in the Ruhr of the great efforts being-made by this country to help the food situation by sending food intothe British Zone. Indeed the whole Ruhr is full of rumours ofwhich the most damaging, from the point of view of coal (and other industrial) production, is that food is actually being exported toEngland from the British Zone (from Hamburg and elsewhere).Everyone I spoke to agreed that this rumour was widely believedand even the German trade union leaders, in conversation with me,would not go further than to say : &quot;I have seen no evidence thatfood is being sent out of the country in this way; it may behappening, it may not.   I do not know.&quot;(10) There is universal agreement (Control Commission, German managersand German trade unionists) that there is a great lack of discipline in the pits and that this is in part responsible for the present lowoutput per man shift. There is universal agreement also that this is largely due to the policy of de-Nazification (a) because of the wide categories of persons who, by reason of their previous affiliations, are liable, under the Inter-Allied decision in regard to de-Nazification, to automatic removal from office;(b) because, in order to continue to earn his livelihood, practicallyevery person of authority in German industry during the nazi regime joined some organisation or did some act which would bring him within the widespread net of the de-Nazificationformula, with the result that members of all management gradesare frightened to enforce discipline, since to do so leads totheir being denounced as former members of the Nazi Party or its affiliated organisations. (It is true that in general theBritish security officers do not act on denunciations of this kind,but the constant fear that they may do so is sufficient toprevent managers running the risk with the consequentdeterioration in the standard of discipline in the pits.)(11) The North German Coal Control are emphatically of the opinion thatthe application to date of the de-Nazification provisions has strippedthe coal mines of managerial staff of all grades to a dangerous extent,that the standard of management has fallen materially through the promotion to managerial posts of persons not qualified to hold themand that even the standard of safety precautions has declined fromthe same cause. (It is commonly believed that the recent very seriousdisaster in a pit in the south of the Ruhr was due at least in part tothe deterioration of the management at this pit owing to the excessivestripping of this pit of its managerial staff, in conformity with therules of de-Nazification.)(12) At the present time between 90 and 100 members of managerial staff who, under de-Nazification, are due for automatic dismissal, are beingretained temporarily in their posts by agreement between the CoalControl and the British Security Stair, who recognise the disastrouseffects which the removal of these men would involve, but who aredebarred by their instructions from agreeing to the permanentretention of these men, none of whom is regarded by them as, in any sense, a dangerous ex-Nazi.(13) Although the trade union leaders in the coal-mining industry are nowasking for an advance in wages, the grant of such advances would offer practically no incentive for bringing men into the industry; still less would it be an incentive to the men already in the industry, since(even after account is taken of the high rate of absenteeism) existingearnings are sufficient and more than sufficient--to. enable them to buy what little there is to buy.(14) Thus until there are some consumers&apos; goods in the shops and more shopsare reopened, there is absolutely no incentive to increased effort on thepart of the miners, even if in their present state of under-nourish-ment they were capable of making such an effort.[31992] B 2
(15) The almost total absence of consumers&apos; goods in the shops is due to the cessation of the manufacture of such goods owing to no coal being available for this purpose. Thus the present shortage of coal is itselfcreating conditions which will inevitably lead to further reductions in total output.(16) Supplies of pit-props are adequate for current needs but there is agreat shortage of other mining supplies, particularly those in themanufacture of which steel plays a part.  The extent of this deficiencymay be gauged by the fact that in normal times the mining supply industry requires approximately 1 million ingot tons of steel perannum.  But owing to the deterioration of the equipment of the minesduring the war both, as the result of non-replacement and war damage the actual needs are above the normal and if these are not met it willbe impossible to maintain output even at the present low level. Mattershave come to such a pass that on occasion whole pits have in recent months had to be shut for three or four days through lack of smallrepairs parts in one machine or another,(17) Within the limits of current steel production, efforts are made by theControl Commission to allot as much as it can to the manufacture of mining supplies, but the quantity so allotted is wholly inadequate andmust continue to remain so, as long as steel production in the british zone remains at its present low level (2-0 million tons a year).   Thereis no lack of steel-making plant and the limiting factor, apart fromman-power, is lack of coal for the steel plants.  Once again the presentlack of coal for industrial purposes in the British Zone is seen to be operating to produce a further reduction in coal output.(18) The general state of depression among the Ruhr miners is accentuated by other events, of which they cannot understand the meaning.Apparently an effort wras made recently to codify the Social security services in Germany (as the result of a decision taken on the Quad-dripartite level at Berlin) and in the process certain benefits which appeared to be anomalous were pruned away.   The result was thatafter the recent pit.disaster in the Ruhr a widow with 2 childrenfound that she was getting a much smaller pension than she wouldhave got under the Nazis and that the widow with 4 children suffered a more than proportionate cut.   Trade Union leaders and individualminers both said to me : &quot; We can&apos;t understand it; we thought thingswould be better when you came but our people are now worse off thanthey were under Hitler and are treated worse.&quot;. (19) In the British Zone the actual operation of the mines is in every casestill in the hands of German technicians, in contrast to the french zone where German technicians have been replaced by Frenchmen.On general grounds I am convinced that our practice in this matter is the right one, quite apart from the fact that in existing conditions it would clearly be impossible to obtain a sufficient number of Britishtechnicians of adequate quality.- At the present time there are about20 French technicians attached to the North German Coal Control insubordinate positions.   I am bound to say that the presence of these officers is unfortunate, since they do not contribute anything material to the work of the Control and their presence is not calculated topromote smooth working with the Germans.   Moreover, these Frenchofficers are no doubt quite as much concerned to keep an eye on theControl itself as to assist in the operation of the mines.Conclusions regarding the action necessary to re-establish the coal industry inthe Ruhr.4. In the early days of the occupation the disorganisation of the Germanrailways was such that the coal raised could not be got away from the mines and large stocks accumulated. Considerable steel supplies have since been allotted to the railways, which have now greatly improved. They can now handle the limited coal supplies available and have been able also to lift the pithead stocks which have now been removed. There are therefore now no coal stocks in the ruhr and in consequence no reserve of coal in the British Zone.5.   Current production in the Ruhr has at present: *(a) to provide supplies (at levels fixed on the Quadripartite basis in Berlin)for the Russian, American and French Zones in Germany and also for the British. American and French Zones in Austria;
(&amp;) to provide substantial exports for France, Belgium and  the other european coal-importing countries, the allocations being made throughthe European Coal Organisation;(c) to maintain a minimum standard of industrial activity in the british zone.6. Under the directive issued last year to the Cormnander-in-Chief, subse-quent to the Potter-Hyndley report, coal exports were to be maximised and the revival of industrial activity in the British Zone was relegated to the future.The period covered by the Potter-Hyndley report has now run out, but the general principle of maximising exports from the Zone still holds the field, thougheveryone with whom I talked, from the Commander-in-Chief down to the officials of the North German Coal Control, recognise that under this system the british zone is being starved, of its essential minimum needs. The general pattern ofthe disposal of coal produced in the British Zone may be seen from the followingtable which shows the allocations of coal from the British Zone in May 1946  British Zone - Tons.       Percentage.Essential civilian purposes   ...      ... 1,432,500Railways, ports, inland water trans-port         ............&apos; 543,110Troops (including Berlin troops)   ... 66,390Total to be retained in british zone............      2,042,000 49-0Transfers to other Zones in Germany United States Zone......... 662,500 15-9French Zone   ............. 158,000 3-8U.S.S.R.

The foregoing analysis shows (a) that, if every practicable measure of help was now being taken to assistthe Ruhr coal industry, it would still be in a very serious positionowing to the shortage of miners and the inadequate food rations givento miners;(b) that, far from everything possible being done to help the Ruhr coalindustry, that industry is now being handicapped most seriously and quite unnecessarily (1) by the lack of mining supplies;(2) by the lack of all incentive to the miners owing to there beingnothing for them to buy with the money which they earn -(3) by the continuance of the de-Nazification policy which is robbingthe pits of efficient management, endangering the safety ofthe workers, and making it impossible to maintain discipline in the.pits through the fear, on the part of managerial staffs,that action of this sort, if taken by them, would lead to their being denounced under the de-Nazification provisions.8.   The conclusions which I have reached are : :(1) that, in order to secure a breathing-space for the Ruhr coal industry andso to save it from collapse (with all the consequent dangers to public security in our Zone), we should now : (a) impose a complete moratorium for six months on all coal exports from the Ruhr; and(b) arrange at the end of the moratorium that the total quantity then to be exported monthly to Europe should not exceed a specifiedpercentage of total production in the preceding month, thatthis percentage should be fixed at 25 per cent, for the first5 million tons of monthly output but should be increased by appropriate steps as output rose above the 5 million-ton level;
(2) that in order to prevent any further deterioration in the management ofthe Ruhr pits and in order to restore to colliery managements thepower to enforce discipline, a date should at once be announced forthe final completion of de-Nazification, after which no person thenstill employed in the undertaking should be liable to be removed from such employment on the ground of his former affiliation with Naziorganisations. (It would no doubt be necessary to qualify this announce-ment in some way in order to secure that there should still be powerto prosecute any dangerous ex-Nazi who had been hiding himself inthe industry, but, if the proposed announcement is to secure the desiredeffect, it will be essential that the power to arrest persons (or dismissthem from employment) on account of former Nazi affiliations shouldbe restricted within narrow limits and only made use of if a seriouscase were to be discovered. Even in such cases the right to exercise the proposed power should be limited to officers above a certain rank.)(Initialled) E.
