June 1946.Copy No.CABINET.1 STATISTICAL REPORTS.Note by the Prime Minister.ON the 12th October I circulated a note (CP. (45) 223) about the arrange-ments made to keep Ministers informed of the main developments of the economicsituation by means of statistical reports. Since that date one or two changes have been made and my colleagues may care to have a revised note of thearrangements.2. The Cabinet agreed (CM. (46) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4) to thepublication of a monthly Digest of Statistics, and copies of this Digest are sentto all Ministers. This published Digest, together with the Statistical Report,Series &quot; A,&quot; will, in future, include all the statistics which have hitherto beengiven in the Reconversion Report referred to in paragraph 3 (a) of CP. (45) 223,and that Report will henceforward cease to be issued.3. The duty of keeping the development of the export trade under regularreview now rests on the Committee on External Economic Policy and OverseasTrade and! a monthly report by the Board of Trade on the United KingdomIexport trade is now circulated to members of that Committee instead of to members of the Lord Presidents Committee.4.   The main monthly statistical reports are thus : (a) General Economic Situation. Statistical Report, Series &quot;A,&quot; preparedby the Central Statistical Office, summarising the key statisticsrelating to  the  current economic  situation; and  the  publishedmonthly Digest of Statistics, which is in effect a continuation of Statistical Digest,  Series  &quot;B.&quot;     A confidential supplement to  the  monthly Digest of  Statistics  is  also prepared  by  the secret.CP.

Arrangements will, however, be madeto circulate any of these reports to any Minister who desires to receive copies.5. I would again draw the attention of my colleagues to the arrangements which have been made to display in my Map Room a series of charts designed to illustrate the statistics in the reports. The Map Room is situated on the groundfloor of the Cabinet Office immediately to the left of the top of the flight of stepsleading from the Park Side Entrance. A messenger is in attendance at thisentrance and will direct Ministers to the Map Room as required.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,17th June, 1946.
