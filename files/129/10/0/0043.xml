(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)2 0S E 0 R I-! T . . &quot;v5 6CP. (h6)  2U3 - COPY NO.__22ND JUNE,  1946CABINET&apos; UNITED SOMALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies1.     The Foreign Secretary&apos;s telegram No. 233 of the 20th Junefrom Paris, reporting his withdrawal of the proposal which he made at. the last Council of Foreign Ministers for the creationof a United Somalia under British trusteeship, raises animportant issue of policy from the Colonial Office point ofview on which I should like to consult my colleagues.2.      I fully appreciate the immense difficulties which theForeign Secretary has had to contend with at Paris in trying to get a peace settlement with Italy, and I realise that theSomali question is only one part of the colonial aspect ofthat major problem.      Everything which has proved to ho .ahobstacle to agreement between major Powers must clearly horemoved so far as this can he done consistently with securing&apos;our essential interests.      So far as I am in a position to judge, what has particularly aroused opposition among theother States concerned on this Somali issue has been our claim that United Somalia should he placed under sole Britishtrustee ship.      Though made in good faith,   this claim has &quot;been represented as.an attempt to annex further territory to theBritish Empire.      In view of the statements which we havemade, in the past disclaiming any intention to seekterritorial additions out of the war,  the claim for Britishtrusteeship over a United Somalia is evidently a very,difficult one to sustain internationally,  even though british administration would probably be preferred to any otheradministration by the&quot;inhabitants themselves.      We should therefore offer no objection to the claim for a UnitedSomalia Under British trusteeship being withdrawn.3.      I feel, however,  that we should consider carefullybefore finally abandoning the idea of a United Somalia assuch.      It has, I think, long been recognised that the case for unifying the Somali  territories and wiping out theexisting arbitrary international frontiers which cut acrossthorn is a very strong one on its own merits, irrespective of the regime to he installed once the area has been unified.There is an opportunity now,  in the course of the post-warsettlement, of rectifying the mistakes of the nineteenth century which have produced this situation.      If this opportunity of a proper settlement is not taken, it maynot recur for many years to come.h,   - Over and above these considerations of general policythere is the special question which concerns my Departmentof the future of British Somaliland.      A return to thestatus quo in this part of Africa would leave us with aBritish. Somali land- within frontiers which past experience has shown to be most unsatisfactory and indeed unworkable.

A considerable part of the essential grazing areas of theBritish Somali  tribes lie on the Ethiopian side of the oldfrontier,  in the Ogaden and the Reserved Area.      Without access to these grazing grounds,  the present end future welfare of theBritish protected tribes cannot be secured,      The most satisfactory way of remedying this situation would he by thecreation of a United Somalia (which would include the grazing.areas).      If the United Somalia project were dropped entirelywe should still he obliged,  in the interests of british somali land, to negotiate bilaterally with Ethiopia for the cession of these vita1  areos.5.      It might be possible to make a further attempt atachieving a United.Somalia if we were prepared to do so at theprice of accepting some regime for the whole area other than british administration.  .   The placing of a British protectorateunder some other authority would &quot;be a far-reaching step calling for very serious consideration.      Subject to the views of mycolleagues, I would not bo -prepared to recommend puttingBritish Somaliland into a United Somalia under theadministration of any single foreign State,      There remains,however, the alternative of an international administration,on the lines of the collective trusteeship originally proposedby the United States for the Italian colonies as a whole.I do not foel that the same objections would apply to mergingBritish Soinalilo.no. into an internationally-administered UnitedSomalia.      In the paper which the Foreign Secretary and Isubmitted jointly to the Cabinet in March&quot;1&quot;, we stated that;&quot;It has become apparent that the substitution of collective trusteeship for British trusteeshipwould not affect the merits of the case for seeking to&apos;create a unified- Somalia.      Suchunification would undoubtedly be far preferable to turn to the status quo which appears theonly other- alternative.1&apos;6.      Before his Majesty&apos;s Government finally agreed to thecreation of a United Somalia under collective internationaltrjrsteeship, it would be necessary to carry the Dominions with us, and also,- in view of past pledges to Parliament,  to consult the British protected Somali tribes.      But- theadvantages to the Somali peoples as a whole of creating a united Somalia are so great that I consider the above solution is one which wo should be justified in recommending strongly to the British Somalis and to which they could reasonably beexpected to agree-4-    CP. (h.6)  10d

7.      For these reasons I should be reluctant to see the door finally closed to the possibility of creating a UnitedSomalia.    I appreciate that the present is not a suitablemoment for pressing thin  solution, tfn view of the turn ofevents over&quot;the Italian Peace Treaty.    The question remainswhether, without prejudicing the general peace settlement,the door can still be Pent open.8.     The immediate problem is one of procedure.    the ethiopians have recently suggested that they might cede toBritish Somaliland an unspecified portion of the grazingareas ,  in return for our ceding to them a corridor to thesea at Zeila in British Somaliland.    The details of this offer still require elucidation; but it is probable that what they are suggesting is a settlement of the problemon the lines of British&quot;policy in the 1930&apos;s.    (This policy was never brought to the stage of negotiation owing to theItalian-Ethiopian war).    Such a settlement would not give usall we want, and would involve placing part of british somali land under Ethiopian rule.    This would no doubt be much-resented by the British Somali tribes concerned,  and the wholeproject would require very careful examination.    It may eventually prove to be the best we can get, and it is arguable that we are more likely to get it now, when the Ethiopians areevidently anxious to reach a general agreement -with us, ratherthan by holding it over for a year in the hope of getting a united Somalia when the disposal of the Italian coloniesfinally comes up.    By that time (unless the present Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement can be extended) v/e should have to haveevacuated the Ogaden and Reserved Area, and our bargaining position would be to that extent weaher.    As against this,by holding the matter over until it can be considered inconjunction with the disposal of the Italian colonies, we might be able -to use the bargaining counter of Eritrea, whichwe should not possess if we embarked now on direct negotiationswith Ethiopia.&quot;9.      It might be possible to get the United Somalia projectmere dispassionately considered no its real merits after theconclusion of the peace treaty.    It would therefore seemvery unfortunate if, in the process of securing our immediateobjectives, v/e were to have deprived ourselves finally ofany chance of raising the United Somalia project again atthat later stage.    We do in fact believe it to be the bestlong-term solution in the interests of all concerned.Moreover, we have now publicly advocated United Somalia onthe grounds that we are seeking only to promote the interestsof the inhabitants.    Having taken up this position, it appearsto me that (in the interests of our general policy towardsdependent peoples) we ought not to withdraw without at leastmaking it plain to the world that the responsibility for preventing such a settlement does not rest with ourselves.10.    The question of&quot; the course to be pursued at thepresent delicate stage of the Paris negotiations must be forthe Foreign Secretary to judge;  and it is also not yet quite clear how the question of the eventual disposal of the italian colonies (as distinct from the immediate issue of what is tobe said on the subject in the Italian Peace Treaty)  is going tobe left.    The withdrawal of our position about United Somaliahas already been made by the Foreign Secretary, and this mustevidently been accepted as&apos; a. fact.    I would urge, however, thatwe should proceed on the basis of the recommendations set out below if we can do so without prejudice to the peace settlement.(Meanwhile we .should.examine with the Ethiopians the propooalin paragraph 8)..

11.    My re cornme ndat ion s aro : -(i) That, if it is decided to make any provisional&quot;arrangements now at Paris about-procedure foreventually disposing of the Italian colonies,the  &quot;terms of reference&quot;  (or equipment.ivs.lent)  should if practicable bo so drawn that the possibilityof taking the ether Somali territories intoaccount as well as Italian Somaliland is not.excluded.(ii) That, if no such arrangements are made now,nothing should be done on our part which wouldirrevocably close the door to our putting theUnited Somalia idea forward again if we desiredto do so at a later stags.(initialled)    G.U.H.Colonial Office, S.W.1.22nd June, 19h7.
