SECRETCP.   (46) S4524TH JUNE.  1946CABINETPAYMENT FOR LOSS OF REMTPTERATIVE TIME to members  OF BODIES&quot;ESTABLISHED UNDERTHE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by_the Chancellor of the exchequer attach the Report by the Official Committee, rappointedin pursuance of the Cabinet decision of 9th May,  1946s toconsider the question of payment for loss of remunerativetime to members of the new bodies to be established under theNational Health Service.2. The Official Committee recommend -(i) that the principle of payment of compensationfor loss of remunerative time should be accepted for the new National Health Service bodies,  subjectto certain exclusions,  the reasons for which aregiven, in paragraphs - 4,  5 and 6 of the Report.(ii) that the principle of eligibility for compensation should apply to all members of thenew bodies,  the payment being conditional onproof of financial loss and limited to theactual loss sustained, within a maximum ofSI/- daily.3. The arrangements proposed by the Committee are,  Ithink, satisfactory;    but..the details may need furtherconsideration,  for example in Scotland, where the existing statutory provision &quot;for payment to County Councillors at af ixed-rate-for loss&apos;of remunerative time may complicate the thing...     But,we must take a decision now on the question&apos;&quot; of principle,  so that provision may be made in the EnglishBill before the conclusion of the Committee Stage.4. I recommend that approval be given to the proposalsof the Official Committee and,&apos;in particular, to a Governmentamendment to the National Health Service Bill to authorisethe Minister to make Regulations on this subject.H.D.Treasurs^ Chambers,  S./W. 1.24TH JUNE,   1946.COPY NO.s   CM.

introduction.      We were appointed with the following&quot; terms of reference. &quot;To consider as a matter of urgency the question of payment for loss of Remunerative time to members of thehew bodies to be established under the national health Service.&quot;We have reached the conclusions summarised in paragraphbelow.2.      Consideration of the question has involved three mainlines of enquiry(a) Investigation of the composition and functionsof the new Bodies.(b) Survey of current practice in Government Depart-ments with which voluntary Bodies55 are at presentassoci ated.(c) Determination of practice for the new Bodies.Composition and Functions of the New Bodies3.      The following thirteen types of Bodies are to be setup under- the National Health Service Bill;(a) Central Health Services Council(b) Standing Advisory Committees(c) Regional Hospital Boards(d) Hospital Management Committees(e) Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals(f) Joint Boards of local Health Authorities1Notes    For the purpose of this Report:, we use the term&quot;voluntary Bodies&quot; as meaning Bodies, whetheradvisory or executive a which, are associated with government Departments and on which the members give their services without receiving remuneration from public Funds.

(g) Health Committees o*f Local Health authorities(h) Executive Councils(i) Local Representative Committees of doctors,dentists and chemists(D)    Medical Practices Committee(k)    Dental Estimates Board(1)   Ophthalmic Services Committees(rn)    The Tribunal (for disciplinary decisions in theGeneral Practitioner service).A brief description of the Bodies is given in Appendix Ito this Report.    Most of the Bodies are based on the principleof unpaid membership, the Bill providing merely for paymentof travelling expenses and subsistence allowances under regulations to be made by the Minister.b.      The practice of paying members of voluntary Bodiesassociated with Government Departments compensation for loss-&apos;of remunerative time from public funds is well established,but where members of such Bodies are directly remunerated fortheir services compensation is not payable.   \ /e think that this principle is sourd and should bo maintained.    The Medical PracticesCommittee- The Dental Estimates Board, and the Tribunal areBodies whose members can, under the Bill, be remunerated fortheir services, and specific provision for compensation for loss of remunerative time is thus unnecessary.    We have,therefore,regarded these Bodies as outside our furtherconsideration.5.      Joint Boards and Health Committees are essentiallylocal authority organisations.    The cruestion of payment to members of local authorities is being remitted for examination by an Independent Committee.35    Payment to members of Joint2With Cabinet Conclusions CM.(1+6) of 9th May, 191+6

Boards and Health Committees must,  in our view, fall to hedetermined in the light of that Committee&apos;s Report    and wehave regarded these Bodies as outside our terms of reference.6.      The Bill provides that the Medical and Dental Practitionersand Pharmacists in the area of any Executive Council may,  ifthey wish, form Local Representative Committees from amongsttheir members for the purpose,  in the main,  of voicing theirprofessional interests in consultations with the responsibleExecutive Councils.    Where such Committees are formed, theMinister has undertaken to recognise them and to require theExecutive Councils to consult them .on appropriate subjects,and we think that the question of compensation of members ofLocal Representative Committees can appropriately be left tothe interested parties themselves.7.      With the exclusion of the six types of Bodies referredto in paragraphs h, 5 and 6 the scope of our enquiry has been restricted to the seven remaining types of Bodies- viz:-Central Health Services CouncilStanding Advisory CommitteesRegional Hospital BoardsHospital Management CommitteesBoards of Governors of Teaching HospitalsExecutive CouncilsOphthalmic Services Committeeand any Sub-committees or similar Bodies which may be formed by the&apos;above Bodies or which may work on their behalf.Survey of Current Practice in Government Beuartmenis withwhich Voluntary Bodies are at present sssccisoel8.      The earliest authority for the payment of eomrersaoiorwe have been able to trace is contained in Section 21(3)  ofthe Trade Boards Act, 1909, which reads&quot;To representative-members of Trade Boards and members(other than appointed members) of district Trade ccrr:ii&quot;ees

any expenses  (including compensation for loss of time),up to an amount sanctioned by the Treasury, which may heincurred by them in the performance of their duties assuch members  .....11    This Act was repealed by the &quot;wages councils Act:, 1945* which provides,  in paragraph 9 ofthe First Schedule,  a more general authority.It is clear from the records that,  in practice;, paymentof compensation was restricted initially to wage earners whosuffered a reduction of their normal earnings through attendingmeetings and were able to prove loss.9.      With the multiplication of voluntary Bodies associatedwith Government Departments, provisions for payment of corn-pens at ion have become widespread.    Consequently, we have examined the current practice over as. wide a field as possible,and a representative  selection of voluntary Bodies associatedwith Government Departments is shewn in Appendix II.10.    The general.results of our survey may be summarised asfollows:-(a) The common practice is to make payments to  &quot;workmenfollowing their trade&apos;-, a phrase which is notinterpreted narrowly, but is regarded as includinge.g.  the working employer,  the clerk9 and, in fact,any wage earner who can prove loss of earnings. TheMinistry of Pensions also makes payments in thesmall number of cases in which shop-keepers, owners of  1 one-man&apos; businesses, or members working on acommission basis, prove loss of earnings or theemployment of a paid substitute.(b) Payment is conditional on proof of loss, and, withthe exception of members of local Insurance Committees(who receive a flat rate of 5s.  a half-day), isbased upon the actual loss sustained, subject to amaximum payment of 21s.  a day.

(c) Some twenty years ago. Treasury authority was givento compensate medical practitioners who were membersof Ministry of Health, and Department of Health(Scotland) Consultative Councils and Committees.vie understand, however that this authority was little used.(d) hotwithstanding the extremely varied composition of the Bodies examined, which appear to representall sections of the community and many diverseorganisations and associations,  the demand for compensation from members outside the category of &quot;workmen following their trade&apos; is negligible.Determination of Pract ice for the New Bodies11.    The new Bodies differ from most of the existing bodies in the preponderance of members drawn from the medical and allied professions,  and we have considered, in the light of current practice and past experience, whether this factjustifies or necessitates special provisions.12.    In considering how far current practice should befollowed or new provisions made,  the principal questions arising appear to us to be:-(a) Should the practice of paying compensation for loss of remunerative time he applied to the newBodies?(b) If the principle of compensation for loss of renumerative time is accepted,  should payment be restricted to  &apos;workmen following their trade&apos;?(c) Should payment,  if made, be; as usually at present,on the basis of actual loss,  subject to a limit,and,  if so, what limit;    or at a flat rate?13&apos;. As regards the question at (a) above, our recornmendati onis that provision, should be mode for. payment of. compensation

&quot;because it seems to us to be vital,  in a service of the scope and importance of the new Health Service, to ensure thatnobody who is willing and competent to take part in its administration should be debarred from doing so on accountof his or her financial circumstances.    It is a principleof the service that financial barriers shall be removed inrespect of those who receive its benefits.    It ought, wefopl,  to be no less a principle in respect of those whoundertake the task of providing and administering the benefits./,. or cover,  the principle of paying compensation is well established and the practice widely followed;-  there arevery few instances where -power to pay compensation does not exist.Against this it may possibly bo said that there isalsc a wide area over which no payment or claims to paymentare made:    there might thus be said tc be a tradition of purely voluntary service which does not require the induce-merit of compensation.    This consideration cannot, however,be decisive,    We do not, in any event, regard compensation as an inducement, but simply as a means of removing obstaclesfrom the path, of individuals willing to serve.lh.    If the conclusion in the preceding paragraph is accepted?the next question, tc determine is whether power to pay compensation should be restricted to certain classes onthe ground that it is a common feature of present arrange-ments to confine payment to  &quot;workmen following their trade&apos;.The principal arguments for raid against restriction in thisway appear to us to be:-Arguments for:-- (a)    The membership of the new Bodies will consistlargely of the professional classes end therewill not in our view be many instances where a

9 9 9% w wcase for payment will actually be established underthe conditions recommended hi paragraphs 15-17 of thisReport.    it could be urged,  therefore,  that thefacts of the position should be recognised and thepower to pay confined to  &apos;workmen following their trade&apos;.(b) There is a widespread current practice in favourof restriction, and to abandon it in respect ofthe new Bodies might advertise a departure from present practice and thus possibly affect thetradition of purely voluntary service which hasbeen a notable feature of public life in this country.Arguments against:-l;.y j: -P&quot;p.(c) Although.,  as stated in (a)  above, we do not expect that many members of the new Bodies will establish a case for payment, yet,  in theory, any one of them,may - a.t some time or other - be in a position to fulfil the conditions for payment described, inparagraphs 15 - 17 and there seeks to be no good reason for &quot;barring such a case: by arbitrary definition of&apos; the classes eligible.(d) The provisions for compensation must be madeeither in the Bill or in Regulations and whilstdistinctions may be adopted by working rule whendealing with cases administratively, it is moredifficult to devise a Statutory definition,restricting the right to certain classes,  either in a Bill or in Regulations.(c)    To confine payments to &apos; workmen following their trade&apos; might, by the very fact of the exclusion of other classes, lead to claims on behalf ofthose classes, with, possibly, undesirable public discussion of class distinctions.

(f)    If, as we suggest in paragraphs 15 - 17,  a limit is.put to the amount of compensation and proof of directless of remuneration is required, the generalobject of restricting payment to cases wherecompensation is really justified will be achieved.Our conclusion is that the appropriate course is to treat all members of the new Bodies as eligible to claimcompensation on the same footing.15.    In considering whether compensation should besasusually at present, on the basis of actual loss, subject toa limit,&apos;, we first had regard to the nature of compensation under current practice.    The payment is designed to avoidsuch financial hardship as might deter a purson from engaging in public service *    incce lost is made up, within a limit/the loss differs in individual cases and the compensationis directly related to the loss sustained.An alternative to the present arrangement would be-to ba.se the compensation payment on total loss of earnings,irrespective of the hardship factor.  If this were done, membersof the new Bodies would be receiving treatment different from that accorded to members of other Bodies alreadyrendering public service in similar circumstances.    V/e donot think that members of the new Bodies should be placedrn that position - or that they themselves would wish, tobe.    To base compensation on total loss of earnings wouldprobably involve the abandonment of an upper limit altogether,and such an arrangement could scarcely be restricted tc thenew Bodies;    any wide extension would lead to a considerably increased cost tc the State from which no correspondingbenefit would result.,-vo therefore do not recommend any fundamental departure from the basis of current practice.

16.    It follows from our conclusion in the preceding paragraph that we favour a limit to the amount of compensation payable in individual cases,    v/e understand that the presentlimit of 21s9 a day, which applies over a wide area-;achievesits purpose,    There have been few complaints and there isno evidence of inadequacy.    We accordingly recommend that21s.  a day be adopted as the maximum for the new Bodies.17.    There remains the question whether payment should beat a flat rate or on the basis  of actual loss, within thelimit recommended.    The weight of current practice is onthe side of the latter method,    only members of localInsurance Committees being compensated by a flat ratepayment,    v/e think that the adoption of a flat rate for thenew Bodies, the amount of which would almost certainly haveto be 21s0  a day, might suggest that the payment was onemade for services rendered and this in our view would bea wrong conception.    In any event,  it is more equitableto compensate to the extent of a loss within the limit,and we recommend this method.18,    The Scottish, members of the Committee agree with, our recommendation that the principle of paying compensationfor loss of remunerative time to members of the new health service bodies should be applied universally both inEngland.and Wales and in Scotland,    The arrangements in Scotland for payment of members of lockl authoritiesare, however, rather different from those in England,There is no provision in England for payment to members oflocal authorities for loss of remunerative time.    InScotland the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, providesfor such payment to members of County Councils, at a fixedrate.    The Scottish members feel bound to call attentionto the difficulty,  in these circumstances,  of deciding now

2c) ron a basis of payment depending on actual wages lost, forthe Scottish Health Service Bodies, which will include asubstantial number of local authority members,  especially as the question of payment to persons serving as localcouncillors is about to be reviewed.    The Scottish members ofthe Committee:&apos;,  therefore;, desire to reserve a finalexpression of view on the question whether: the same basisof payment can be adopted in Scotland as in England..    Theywould, however, propose that power should be taken in thoScottish Health Service Bill to provide by regulations for payment of compensation, leaving the detailed arrange-ments to be considered further.Summax ,y of Rocoiamendaticns19.    Our recommendations are: -*(a)    That for the following six types of Bodies provision should not be made for payment of compensationfor loss of remunerative time to tho members:The Medical Practices Committee )The Dental Estimates Board )  paragraph kTho Tribunal - )(    being Bodies which can, under the Bill,be remunerated for services.Joint Boards of local Health Authorities )) ParagraphHealth Committees of Local Health 5Authorities )being Bodies whose members will be membersof local authorities, the question of their remuneration or compensation will fall to bedetermined in the light of the independent committee 1s report.Local Representative Committees    )    paragraph 6being Bodies formed by the doctors, dentistsend chemists to voice their professionalinterests in consultations with executive councils and therefore appropriately leftto make their own arrangements.
