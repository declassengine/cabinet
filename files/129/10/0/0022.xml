(46) 222.14th June, 1946.CABINET.SITUATION IN INDIA AND ITS POSSIBLE EFFECT UPONFOREIGN RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT their meeting on the 5th June (confidential annex to Cabinet MinutesCM. (46) 55th Conclusions), the Cabinet agreed that we could not exclude thepossibility that in certain circumstances the situation in India might be brought before the United Nations Organisation as one which might affect the peace ofthe, world. As their Conclusion No. (3) the Cabinet accordingly invited me, inconsultation with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India, toarrange for a memorandum to be circulated showing in what circumstances thesituation in India might be brought to the attention of the United Nations.2. In accordance with this Conclusion, I circulate to my colleagues as an annex to this paper, a study of the theoretical possibilities under the united nations Charter, in which I have included certain comments to bring out theeffect of the various alternative courses. This study has been prepared inconsultation with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for India, who agrees with it.3. In addition my colleagues will no doubt wish to know what effects thesituation in India may be expected to have upon our foreign relations. Theseeffects, in so far as they can be estimated, are set out in the ensuing paragraphs.4. The conclusions to be deduced from the Annex to this paper are that anappeal by the Government of India or by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to the United Nations would be tantamount to a virtual relinquishmentof sovereignty and a confession that we were incapable of maintaining law andorder in India. It is hard to see what practical advantage would result, andon the other hand it might also amount to a virtual invitation to the soviet union to take our place. Were some other Government to take the initiative in bringing the Indian situation before the United Nations Organisation, andwere we not to challenge the competence of the Organisation under the Charter,the result would be the same.5. In general, any action by His Majesty&apos;s Government which appears tosuggest that we are abandoning our position in India without obtaining asolution on the lines put forward by the Cabinet Mission would weaken ourposition in international affairs to the extent that it can be interpreted as evidence of a decline in British power and resolution. This is particularly trueas regards the United States, where the Administration have for some monthspast been urging us not to abandon essential strategic positions in India and even to combine with them in an approach to the Government of India to be allowedto participate in the use and upkeep of some of these positions. Their motiveis apprehension as regards Russia and they would be dismayed by any policy onour part which offered Russia an opportunity to interfere in India. An openabandonment by us of our position in India without safeguards might wellembarrass them to the point where they would feel unable to give us any public support in the matter. As regards American public opinion, such sympathyas we might hope to get and it would not be much from liberal internationalistcircles for a policy of abandonment would be infinitely outweighed to our disadvantage by the confirmation that far wider circles would see in such apolicy of their assumption that we no longer had the means or resolution to faceour responsibilities. Even a reference of the issue to the United Nations wouldbe a matter of regret to the Administration in so far as Russia was thereby13375   [31969] bVPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946. r\c,SECRET. Copy No.
given an opportunity to fish in troubled waters. In general, it may be saidthat the Administration will be behind us in any policy which, while leavingopen a solution on the lines put forward by the Cabinet Mission, shows clearly that, in the meantime, we intend to maintain the essential responsibilities ofgovernment in India.6. By withdrawing from India, or even to Pakistan, the Soviet union would be robbed of the argument at present employed by their propaganda thatGreat Britain is insincere in its approach to the Indian problem, but this wouldbe compensated by the opportunity afforded to take advantage of our weakness.The attitude of the Soviet Union in the event of an appeal to the United nations organisation is referred to in the Annex to this paper.7. Among the Arab States of the Middle East the reaction to the situationin India will be predominantly influenced by our solution of the Palestine andthe Egyptian problems. If the solution of the former is unfavourable to theArabs, or if there is a hitch over Egypt, and if, at the same time, it can berepresented that we are abandoning the Moslems in India, then there will bea greater incentive to violence. Both in the Arab States and in Persia the mainreaction will be a tendency to put up less resistance to Russian pressure in propor-tion as it may appear that the British position in India is becoming weaker.8. In the Far East political developments in India are likely to be watchedwith interest by nationalist elements in the hope that they may derive advantagetherefrom. But since all Far Eastern countries are at present absorbed in theirown affairs, the situation in India may be expected to produce no major reactions.On the other hand, any apparent weakness on our part will adversely affect our prestige throughout the Far East and correspondingly diminish our influence and authority.9. We must also consider what the political repercussions will be if we remainin India and become militarily involved to the extent that it is necessary towithdraw British forces from other areas to reinforce our position.10. If we become heavily involved in India the Soviet Union may be disposed to intervene elsewhere as, for instance, in Persia or Turkey. The withdrawalof British forces from Germany, Italy, Greece or the Middle East would render it easier for the Soviet Union to pursue their policies in these areas, and theywould tend in consequence to stiffen their attitude in negotiations. withdrawal from Italy would encourage Yugoslavia to occupy Trieste.11. In the Middle East the withdrawal of British Forces might make itdifficult for us to bring them back again later on if we wanted to. In Palestinetheir withdrawal would lead, in present circumstances, to civil war and anarchy,unless replaced by American troops.12. In Greece withdrawal before Greek forces are in a position to maintaininternaJl security and to guard the frontiers wrould undo all we have beenattempting to do to put Greece on her feet again and would greatly discouragethe Turks.13. In Indonesia the premature withdrawal of Indian troops without their replacement by British forces would have a seriously adverse effect upon theprospects of a Dutch-Indonesian settlement. No major political repercussionswould result from the withdrawal of Indian troops from Japan.14. Disaffection among Indian troops while stationed in Far Easternterritories would seriously undermine our authority, especially if it led to localdisorders.15.   To sum up, the conclusions are :-(a) Reference to the United Nations Organisation would have serious reper-cussions on our prestige, and, so far as can be seen, would not bringany practical help, either to us or to India; thus the intervention ofthe United Nations Organisation should be avoided or, if proposedby another Power, be resisted.(&amp;) Any appearance of abandonment of our position in India without asolution would weaken our world position; and(c) The premature withdrawal of British forces to reinforce India, or ofIndian forces from Indonesia would weaken our influence in the areas concerned and adversely affect the solution of existing problems inthose areas.
16. Finally, I consider it to be of the utmost importance that the UnitedStates should be taken into our confidence as soon as we have decided upon ourcourse of action.&apos;     ... E. B.Foreign 0 ifice.Uth June, 1946.   .ANNEX.Situation in India and the United Nations Organisation.ALL the provisions in the Charter of the United Nations Organisationrelating to the preservation of peace, whether they are the provisions of chapter VI relating to the settlement of disputes which, if continued, willthreaten the peace, or whether they are the provisions of Chapter VII which deal with measures taken by the Security Council to enforce peace, relate to international clashes and not to the maintenance of peace within a State, evenif a State dissolves into a state of civil war. The maintenance of peace withina State is a matter of domestic jurisdiction, and, prirna facie, domestic juris-diction also covers a civil war. On the other hand, a state of complete disorderwithin a State, and particularly a civil war, may involve dangers to international peace because the lives of foreigners within the territory may be endangered,and more particularly because the civil war may be fought on issues which rangethe States of the outside world in strong sympathy with one or the other party.This strong sympathy may arise from community of religion, i.e., Moslems and moslem States, or on ideological grounds (e.g., because one of the parties in a civil war adopts a Communist ideology and the other party is dubbed by theCommunist States as Fascist).2. If it is right to picture the situation in India as one where gravedisorders, perhaps amounting to civil war, are taking place; where the Moslemsand the Hindus are in conflict; and where either one or both parties are hostile to the British and perhaps to Europeans in general; then it may be said thatthere is a situation which, if continued, may threaten international peace. Afurther factor is the presence in Egypt, Indonesia and elsewhere of Indian troopswho may become disaffected and create a problem in the foreign countries wherethey are stationed. On the other hand, it is equally true that the assistancefrom U.N.O. which is really required immediately is not suggestions andrecommendations for settlement of an internal dispute in India but practicalassistance in the way of forces to maintain order and maintain communica-tions, &amp;c, so that the otherwise starving people of India can be fed.3. The situation in India might be brought to the attention either of theSecurity Council or of the General Assembly of the United Nations. As the reference would presumably be connected with a state of grave disorder in India,the Security Council is perhaps the more likely of the two, in view of the primary responsibility conferred upon it under the Charter for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Moreover, the Security Council is in continuoussession and has the power to take positive military action, whereas the general assembly only meets once a year (in September) and cannot do more than make recommendations, referring to the Security Council any question of takingmilitary action.Reference to the Security Council.4.   The possibilities here can best be considered under two heads assuming :  (a) reference to the Security Council by the Government of India (in practice by the Governor-General since under the present constitution he is him-self in charge of External Affairs) or by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom, if, as is possible in the conditions predicated,the Government of India were not capable of acting ;* or(b) by the Government of some other State.* As India is a separate member of U.N.O. it would be preferable, if course (a) is taken atall; that the reference should go in the name of the Government of India. On the&apos;other hand,as the Government of India is, under the existing law, amenable in all respects to direction byHis Majesty&apos;s Government it would be a legitimate exercise of its authority for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to act as de facto and de jure the responsible government.[31969] &apos; b 2
A alternative.5. (a) The Government of India could bring the matter before the security council under Article 35 (1) as a &quot; situation which might lead to internationalfriction,&quot; and it would then be the duty of the Security Council to determine whether the continuance of this situation was likely to endanger the maintenanceof international peace and security. The supporting argument would no doubt be that a state of anarchy, conflict or civil war in India was, by its repercussionsamong the population of other States (e.g., the Mohammedan States) or by its general effect upon foreign interests and nationals, likely in fact to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. If the situation were brought before the Security Council in this way by the authority having responsi-bility for the administration of India, there would be an automatic waiver (whichit might be desirable to state expressly in the letter to U.N.O.) of the provision in Article 2 (7) of the United Nations Charter, whereby &apos;&apos; nothing in the Chartershall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentiallywithin the domestic jurisdiction of any State or shall require the Members tosubmit such matters to settlement under the present Charter.&quot;6. In accordance with Article 36 (1) of the Charter, the Security council could then &quot; recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment.&quot; Inpractice, these would be most unlikely to settle the grave situation in India andthe Council would then have to consider whether it should proceed to Article 39of the Charter and determine the existence of a &quot; threat to the peace.&quot; UnderArticle 39, the Council could then either make further recommendations or decide what measures should be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42 to &apos;1 main-tain or restore international peace and security.&quot; Article 41 deals with non-military sanctions, which would be obviously unsuitable. Article 42, how-ever, provides that, if non-military measures (Article 41) would be inadequate,the Security Council may proceed to &quot; take such action by land, sea or air forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.&quot;It goes on to provide that such action may include operation by the forces of member States. Article 43 of the Charter provides that all Members of theUnited Nations shall make available under Agreements between themselves andthe Security Council armed forces to assist the Council in maintaining inter-national peace and security, but no such Agreements have yet been concludedand the whole matter is at a very early stage. Therefore it might be contended.that Article 106 of the Charter applies, under which the Five permanent members of the Security Council are to take joint action on behalf of U.N.O.for the purpose pending the coming into force of the agreement to be made underArticle 43.7. In accordance with Article 47 (3) the Military Staff Committee of theSecurity Council (composed of the representatives of the five Permanent Membersof the Council) is responsible under the Security Council for strategic directionof any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Council.Comment.8. It must be emphasised that if the Government of India, or His Majesty&apos;^Government, took the initiative of appealing to the Security Council in this way,they would in fact have abandoned their sovereign authority over India andwould have invited the United Nations Organisation to assume that responsi-bility. The political consequences of this action would obviously be incalculable,from every point of view. In particular, we might be certain that the SovietGovernment, who by their power of veto could prevent any action in a sensefavourable to British interests, would seek to draw her own profit from thesituation. The military aspect is rather for the Chiefs of Staff, but it seems likely that in the event of the Council being in principle ready to take military action to restore order in India, the Soviet Union would be the only country whichwould be both ready and able to supply the necessary number of troops. Theresult of such an appeal to the Security Council might therefore amount inpractice to handing over the Empire of India to the Soviet Union.A Iternativp.9.-*(b) Any other State Member of the United Nations could bring thesituation in India to the attention of the Security Council in accordance withthe same Article 35 (1). So long as the Council was considering the disputeunder Chapter VI of the Charter, the Government of India (or His Majesty&apos;sGovernment) could invoke the &quot;domestic jurisdiction&quot; Article 2 (7) as a bar
to action by the Council. If, on the other hand, the Government of India (or his MJajesty&apos;s Government) were willing to have the situation in India discussed by the Council, then they could expressly waive their rights under Article 2 (7)and the position would be as described under (a) above.10. If, on the other hand, the matter were brought before the council under Article 39 of the Charter, as a &quot; threat to the peace,&quot; either by theaction of the Council itself arising out of the discussion under Article 35 (1)or by some State raising the matter directly under Article 39, the Governmentof India (or His Majesty&apos;s Government) would not be able to invoke &quot; domestic-jurisdiction &quot; under Article 2 (7) as a. bar. However, it would be open to them to argue that the situation in India in fact did not constitute a threat to the peace of the world, and, if any State were to take the law into its own hands by seeking to intervene in India, then the tables would be turned and it would be that state which could be arraigned as responsible for a threat to, or breach of, international peace and security.Comment.11. In the event of the Government of India (or His Majesty&apos;s Government)agreeing to the matter being discussed in the Security Council on the initiative of another State, the situation would be as in the comment under (a) above. Inthe event of their resisting the proposal, His Majesty&apos;s Government would in thelast resort retain the right to veto any action proposed by the Security Council,since they could prevent the matter from being declared a &quot; dispute &quot; under chapter VI, and they have an absolute veto on any action proposed under chapter VII.Reference to the General Assembly.12. Any State could raise the situation in India in the General Assemblyunder Article 11 (2), which provides that the General Assembly may discussany question relating to the maintenance of international peace and security, orunder Article 14, wdiich provides that &quot; the General Assembly may recommendmeasures for the peaceful adjustment of any situation regardless of origin whichit deems likely to impair the general welfare or friendly relations amongnations.&quot; Under either Article, however, the General Assembly could not do more than make recommendations, either to the State or States concerned orto the Security Council or to both. Moreover, the General Assembly could not(as a result of Article 12) make any recommendations if the Security council was already considering the matter or elected to do so. Any action, in the sense of physical steps to restore order, could only be taken by the Security Council,and, if the General Assembly thought such action necessary, it could only proceed by way of recommendation to the Security Council.Comment.13. The General Assembly would be the more suitable body if we desiredto debate before the United Nations the whole complex of the situation in India,and thus in some sense to share the responsibility with the other United Nations.The General Assembly takes decisions in matters of substance by a two-thirds majority of those present and voting, and there is no veto. But, as already mentioned, the General Assembly only meets once a year, and is powerless totake any military action to restore order, for which purpose it must refer to theSecurity Council. The majority view of the General Assembly is essentiallythat of the small States, and its sympathy would no doubt lie with what wasconceived to be the desires of the Indian people. It would be likely to be critical of the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
