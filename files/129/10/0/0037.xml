DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (U6)  257 0OPY NO.19TH JUNE , 1SA6CABINETOUTPUT. RECRUITMENT - AID CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENTIN&quot;&quot;THE COALMINING industry memorandum by the Minister of Labour end National service am strongly in favour of a five-day week and thepayment for holidays in the coalmining industry and I believethat it would stimulate output.      At the same time I feel itnecessary to draw my colleagues&apos;  attention to the possibleresults of the methods by which it is proposed to effectthese changes and the reactions they may have.2. In his Paper, CP. (US) 232, the Minister of Fuel and power states (paragraph&apos; 12(5):-&quot;The conditions which must be attached to a grant offive-day week will involve negotiations and agreementnot only directly between the Government and theExecutive of the National Union of Mineworkers:, butalso at district and pit level throughout the country.&quot;This is a new departure, the implications of which requireserious consideration.      Direct negotiations between theGovernment and the Union on wages and conditions is contraryto the general principle of allowing industry itself to settleits own conditions.      Moreover, the suggestion that theGovernment may be concerned in negotiations with branchesof the Union, or even possibly with pit committees, isdisturbing.      The repercussions of this on the negotiating machinery in industry may be serious and widespread.3- Furthermore, the proposed announcement that theGovernment have decided that a five-day week will beintroduced, that wage payments will be made in respect of statutory holidays, and that a bonus payment equivalent tothat for one shift-will be made to all men working five shiftsinvolves an even greater breach in the principle of collectingbargaining,  as it means that the Government itself is fixingwages and conditions.      In the field of hours of labour it isparticularly important at the present time that there shouldbe no breach of this principle, having regard to the demandfor the Government to enforce a UO-hour week in industry.Direct Government intervention to secure a five-day week inthe coalmining industry will inevitably lead to strongrequests, which will be difficult to refuse,  for the government take similar action in respect of other socialised Industrie!It will also lead to requests for Government  action to securereductions in hours of work in other industries.

U. The proposal for a bonus payment for good %attendance involves a major amendment of the PorterAward, under which the coalmining industry&apos;s wages areregulated.      The coalmining industry is at presentgoverned by an &quot;agreement which stabilised wages until19^8.      It  is possible that a major adjustment of wages in the mining industry, which this amendment would represent, might have repercussions on wages applicationsthroughout the industry generally and lead to anothercycle of wages increases.5. In view of the above, I suggest that, until theNational Goal Board takes over, the proper procedure isfor any alteration in existing arrangements to be negotiated between the national Union of Mineworkersand the Mining Association.6. Also I would suggest that if it is decided tomake any announcement of such far-rea*hing importanceit should be the subject,of a Parliamentary statement and not made in the first instaiice at a conference ofone side of the industry.(Signed)    G.A.  ISAACS.Ministry of Labour and national Service, 8,1?. 1 ,19TH JUNE ?  19u7.
