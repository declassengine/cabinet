ANNEX  &apos;A&apos;INDEX 61 &apos;        3rd June, 19A6Following Top Secret for Prime Minister fromCabinet Delegation and Viceroy.Index k3&quot;kl, Index 50, 56 and 59 containcorrespondence which ha,s passed between us and Azad and Gandhisince the issue of our statement of the l6th Hay.These letters together with Congress resolution of2hth Hay show the present attitude of Congress.      Muslim Leagueattitude will &quot;not be decided until meeting of Muslim LeageCouncil fixed for 5th June.      Jinnah&apos;s statement of 22nd May wasnot very encouraging but he has recently made a public referenceto the desirability of a settlements      The interpretations whichCongress have placed upon our statement would* if they prevailed,almost certainly make it unacceptable to the Muslim League.      Butwe have already publicly repudiated these interpretations.2. Apart from this  the difficult question of the powersand composition of the Interim Government is still unsettled.We have succeeded in convincing Congress that there can be no legal change in the present constitution, but they are stillpress inn for a Convention or Gentleman&apos;s agreement under&apos;whicha large measure of de facto independence would be assured.     Wocertainly could not go as far as that as it would leave usconstitutionally responsible, while depriving us in advance ofthe means of implementing our responsibility.      Viceroy&apos;s letterof 30th May to Azad will perhaps satisfy Congress, but we may be compelled to go somewhat further by making a public statementof a general kind as to the attitude that the Viceroy and HisMajesty&apos;s Government will adopt to the Interim Government and. weshall be&quot; telegraphing you text of this for your approval beforeissue.Viceroy feels strongly that no further concession ispossible except as a result of a demand by both Parties and notmerely Congress. In any case indications are that Jinnah willnot come in unless Viceroy&apos;s existing powers remain. muslim league are also likely to insist on parity v/ith Congress in the interim Government and to this Congress declare themselves opposed.3. We are not without hope of coming to an agreement with both Parties on all points at issue as we have reason to believethat the majority of the Working Committee of Congress desire toreach a peaceful settlement.      Even if our plan for constitution-making machinery is not accepted, it may still be possible to get agreement between the major Parties as to the setting up of an interim Government.      Nevertheless, we have to be prepared forfailure to achieve this.      We arc aware that there is  an important element in the Congress which aims at securing&apos; control of the interim Government and forcing upon us the removal of Britishtroops  and officials  so that it can deal with the Muslims and theStates in its own way and subsequently impose a Constitution oiits own choosing.      This element believes that the Muslims can becomparatively easily suppressed and. is indifferent to theconsequences in terms of bloodshed, administrative chaos and

famine.      This&apos; element may get control if the. moderates fail tosecure by peaceful negotiation an arrangement which they can accept.k* We expect that the crisis will he reached any time between 5th and 15th dune and a break may occur because - a)    of a rejection hy the Muslim League, orvb)    of a rejection by Congress, or(c)    of a rejection by-both.We are agreed that if breakdown occurs Ministers should leavevery soon afterwards for London remaining here only for suchshort period as may be necessary to arrange for action under(a) ,   (b)   or  (c) below.(a) If the breakdown oomes through the refusal of the muslim League to take part in the Interim Government orConstituent Assembly, or if they make impossible conditions5Congress will undoubtedly expect us to go ahead without them,and will quote the statement of the Prime Minister.      If wedo not fulfil their expectation,:; ,  they will accuse us of bad faith and we should expect a crisis to arise almost at once.We could make one last effort to get the Muslim League to seereason.      We should inform thorn that we must go ahead withhanding over independence to India,  in spite of theirintransiganco; and that while- we do not intend to assist congress to enforce Hindu domination, we have no intention of assisting the muslim League to a sovereign Pakistani We shouldremind Congress of their repeated assertions that they will&quot;allowindependence to those parts of the country which desire it and state that we propose to proceed as far as practicable with theplan indicated in our statement of 16 th May with such modificationas circumstances require.The Interim Central Government would be composed, of congress representatives and some representatives of minoritieswith a proportion of seats reserved for the Muslim League butfilled for the time being by officials or non-league Muslims.(b) If the Congress refuses, while the Muslim League agree,the situation would be much more serious.      We should invite;Muslims to go on with their own constitution-making in Groups Band JJl    ie our grouping,and if N.W.F.T.  or ASSAM refuse to send representatives to the Group constitution-making bodies, carryon without them.      The Central Government would have Muslim Leaguerepresentatives and representatives of the minorities with septsreserved for Congress but held temporarily by officials or Non-Congress Hindus. In the rest of India we should have toconsider the circumstances as they arose, but we should endeavourto get Provincial Assemblies  to elect representatives to theConstituent;/. Assembly for the Hindustan provinces;    it may wellbe that this plan would not be carried out with success and thatthere would be widespread opposition which would lead to thesituation we. deal with later, in this telegram.... p

(c)      If both Congress and the Muslim League finally reject the scheme after we have made every further effort to arrive atsome compromise the Cabinet Minister;.! propose to return home atonce,     &quot;Before they do so we would to is,sue a statement givingour version of the breakdown and-announcing that the search for asolution would be continued, but that in the meanwhile ministers are returning for consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government andthat the Viceroy will be re-opening fresh negotiations shortly.We  think that this statement may hold the situation forsufficiently long to enable the matter to bo fully reviewed athome and for instructions to be given to Viceroy as to new approach.      We shall of course be most careful not to commitmission to return themselves to India after consultation, or tosuggest that other Ministers will be sunk out in their place.5. It is possible, however,  that the issue of this,statement will fail to hold the situation and the-Viceroy mayhe faced shortly after mission have left with open opposition from Congress which may develop into a mass struggle on 1942lines, but more widespread and better organised.    This may be accompanied by the resignation of provincial Congress Ministriesor the Ministries may remain in office and join in acts ofdefiance.      It is essential  therefore that the Viceroy should ,have from His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government an indication of the policyhe should carry out in this event.      It is further desirable thatwe should have this policy in our mind when we engage in discussions with the Muslim League- and with Congress which maybegin any time after 6th June.      Moreover, even if the situationis held for the time being (i.e.  immediately after the departure of&apos;the Mission)   it may well be that the further negotiations may break down later and that a clash -with Congress may occur then.6. We contemplate&apos;that in the first instance disturbancesmay be local and unco-ordinatod and we are all agreed, that thecountry must continue to be governed effectively curing thisohase and such disturbances must be suppressed.     At the same-time constructive efforts to promote a settlement should notbe, abandoned but the nature of such a settlement must depend, uponthe course that it is intended to follow in the last resort.

revolt or a declared Muslim League Jehad.      The civilian services are tired and discouraged and the loyalty of the pel/c-y wouldbe uncertain under the strain which a repressive policy would put upon them.      Apart from its feasibility a full-scale policyof repression would mean an end of political progress for a long period and the long term incarceration of the Indian Leaders,Government would have to be carried on by executive councils&quot; of officials both at the centre and in the -provinces indeteriorating&quot;conditions.      We should thus gain no ultimateadvantage.      Finally the process of repression might bring as great disasters&apos;to India in regard to famine as any other&quot;courso,and if so we should be held responsible.      We do not therefore recommend it.8. At the other extreme is a decision-to withdraw fromthe whole of India as soon as the Congress call for a general massmovement against us.      This would,  if necessary, be a military operation, plans for which in emergency conditions have been worked out.      Those are broadly speaking to hold the main ports and for as long as possible Delhi and certain strong points whereEuropeans can concentrate and be given protection.      This meanswithdrawing Governors and. officials and European civilians,except those who wish to stay, and thus relieving ourselvesforthwith of all responsibility for India without furtherconcerning ourselves with her internal differences.      The almostinevitable consequences would bo administrative chaos resultingfrom withdrawal of koi) European administrators, famine, and civil war.      We feel that s&apos;uch a withdrawal would cause generalconsternation throughout the British Commonwealth and that unionsobviously forced, upon/from sheer necessity of the situation it ought not to be adopted.9. A possible variation of this plan designed to mitigate the consequences of withdrawal would be to announce our intentionof withdrawing from India by a certain date, say, 1st January, 1947*and. to occupy the interval with an attempt to make arrangements with the political parties for phased withdrawal which would give them time and. opportunity to organise their own administration.In effect this would amount to handing over the central Governmentof India,  after possibly a short transition, to Congress.      Ourjustification would be that we wished to avoid the charge of having increased the dangers of famine and chaos which we ourselvesanticipate by an instantaneous -withdrawal, as under paragraph 8&quot;it. would have the advantage of retaining the goodwill of theCongress.      But on the other hand., it would alienate the Muslimsand^their reaction would probably be such that we should have towithdraw immediately from the Muslim majority provinces, and civil war would result.      Our failure to support the Muslims inobtaining the degree of independence which we have -publicly so id.in our recent statement we consider them entitled to, would involve us in discredit and would react to our detriment in our relationswith the Muslim States of the Middle East.      In the event of civil war we should, have failed to secure our main object of avertingadministrative chaos and this course which would be represented^as a surrender to Congress, is really no better than the form of withdrawl which we have already advised against.10. It has been suggested to us by several people in Indiaand has been mentioned elsewhere that with the concurrence of theprincipal parties in India the British should submit the wholeIndian question to the decision of the United Nations or to some-h-

named international arbitrator and agree to abide by the result.Wo do not think it is likely that His Majesty&apos;s Government willbe attracted to this idea in present circumstances and we do not therefore think it necessary to  elaborate the cogent arguments against it.11. If we reject a &quot;policy of repression and of inter-national arbitration and if general withdrawal is  to be adoptedonly as a conn el of despair, we must find an alternative whichis practicable.      The general situation v/e are considering willhave arisen because the Congress has refused to co-operate andis determined to seize power as soon as possible and it is extremely unlikely that there will be any hope of compromise between the two major parties.     We now describe what appears tous to be the best alternative.      In doing so we deal with theBritish Indian situation, but v/e should be free in executing sucha plan, to take advantage of the friendly attitude of many of the rulers of the larger states.12. The plan that we put forward would briefly be to allow the six provinces of Madras, Bombay, 0.1.., U.P. s Bihar and Orisaa,which are almost entirely Hindu,   to become self-Governing inevery respect;    but to maintain for the time being the existing constitution, in the remo.in.der of British India, and the existingrelationship with certain of the States.      This would moam ineffect giving independence to southern and central India and maintaining the existing    osition in North-West and north-BastIndia.13. Before putting ouch a plan into operation, -we should first of oil make a last approach to Congress and explain to them the main feature of this plan with the hope, firstly, of indueingthem,  in the interests of Indian unity,  to come to a settlement on the terms of our statement of lbth May;    or, failing this, to persuade them to agree to the orderly execution of this plan.Wo should then put the proposal before the Muslim League and endeavour to obtain their acceptance of it.lip. The aim of these approaches would be to secure the orderly acceptance of the plan and the time necessary to carryout the division of the Indian Array, the necessary arrangementsfor communications, and other administrative arrangementsconsequent on this division of India.      Luring this time weshould endeavour to maintain, by common consent, a government at the centre, possibly composed ox officials, which would,continue to deal with the present central functions.15. If Congress refused, this approach, we should inform them that we propose to put the plan into operation, to withdraw from the six Hindu provinces and to deal with any opposition thatwe encounter in doing so.16. The plan is in effect that laid down in paragraphs 11to 13 of the Viceroy&apos;s appreciation4&quot; which has been sent you.17. The following are additional details of the plan.The six Hindi provinces -would, at once.proceed to set up their owngroup government, which when formed would take over, for theirown area,  all central subject;:; including foreign affairs, defence-1-   Annex &apos; B&apos;

and communications.     We should use all our influence to secureadequate provision for minorities in the new group and provincial constitutions;    and should not anticipate any greetdifficulty in doing so.      An endeavour should he made to securedefence arrangements with this independent part of India.18. In the remainder of British India, the present constitution would remain in force except in so far as the separation of the six Hindu provinces made a change necessary.This means that the responsibility of the Governor-General andof Parliament for these area;; will continue for the time being.The communal problem is very acute in the Punjab and Bengal,and the temporary maintenance of British Control in those areas will be necessary in India&apos;s interest.      This continuance ofBritish responsibility would!., we hope steady North-West and north-hast India while the rest of British India was establishingits freedom.      V.o should intend to maintain ourselves at Delhiduring this period.19. Meanwhile we should encourage North-West and North-East India to determine their own. constitutions with due regardto minority rights.      The possibility of non-Muslim areascontiguous to the Hindustan ^provinces opting out and. joiningHindustan would have to be considered.20, During the interim period we would encourage everysort of co-operation between Northern.India and the rest ofIndia in the hope that feeling in. favour of an Indian union would, grow.21. The advantages of this plan are:-(a) It is consistent with what we ourselves have recognised in our statement as justice for the Muslims.(b) It absolves us from the charge of letting downentirely those who supported, us in the war and who were givenassurances in 19H0 that they would, not be subjected by theBritish Parliament to a form of government whose authority theydirectly denied.(c) It gives complete political independence to the Hindumajority in their majority area without qualification.      By doing so it disarms  the Congress whose weapons of civil disobedienceand sabotage in these areas &quot;would be made ineffective.(d) It is consistent with our undertaking that the resistance of a minority must not be allowed to impede thepolitical progress of the majority.(e) We escape the risk of becoming involved in assisting the Hindus to suppress a Muslim revolt.The disadvantages are:-(i)      It will be argued that we are lending; our support to the partition of India In spite of our statement of 6th May.(ii)     We should remain responsible for the course of events in the Muslim majority provinces where there might be trouble with  the Hindu and Sikh minorities.(iii)      We might find it difficult to make our eventualwithdrawal iron the Muslim areas at the -moment of our choice.

22. It has not of course escaped our notice that the plan-ve have described above cannot be carried out within theprovisions of the existing constitution as defined in the india act of 1955&apos;      It is admittedly an emergency plan to be defendedon the ground of urgent necessity and requiring subsequent approvalof Parliament.-..    We should like to make it clear that none of usregards  this plan as fully satisfactory,      There- is no satisfactory solution except by securing agreement and v/e must therefore leave-no atone unturned to obtain that agreement,     jS.ll that can besaid of. our plan is that it is the least bad of all the possible alternatives in a situation which wo hope will not arise but of which we must face the possxbility,23- 11 is necessary for us to lay these ultimate possibilitiesbefore you at this stage and to ask for the preliminary reaction of His Majesty is Government on what should bo done in thesituations described above, for two reasons.      First, because the handling of next phase of our discussions with the Party Leaders,which will begin after the 5th Juno, depends to some extent;uponthe policy to be adopted in the last resort.      And secondly,because a dangerous situation may arise quite suddenly, and itmay then be necessary for prompt action to be ink en with the shortest possible time for consultation with you,as anyhesitation may unnecessarily endanger the lives of our nationals.2d. We are aware that wo have &quot;-said very little in theabove with regard to the States.      It may be taken for granted that most of the rulers would prefer British rule to&quot;continue at anyrate until they have been given time to adjust their relationswith Brit lab. India.;    and that they would regard a prematurewithdrawal as a betrayal of their interests and a poor reward fortheir loyal support in the war-     We should therefore use our utmost endeavours with  the Hindu provinces to obtain for them thebest possible terms in. the new situation.25. It is plain that the risks to Europeans in the country may become very considerable.     We think that the Ministry ofTransport and Service Departments should work out on a top secretbasis an emergency plan for removal of United Kingdom civilians,from India sna. consult GsH.Q.  India in regard to it.      It wouldbe a great help if immediate steps could be taken to expedite the passages home of women and children of whom there are longwaiting lists..26, .     Owing to his illness Gripps has not sat in throughoutthe discussions on. this  telegram, but he has discussed final draft.      He dissents from the condemnation of proposals described in paragraph 9 which he considers would be more workable than Lireplan recommended..

APPRECIATION OF POSSIBILITIES IN INDIA,MAY,   19 U6By His^Excellcncy the viceroy,      The Cabinet Delegation have asked for an appreciation of the situation likely to arise if our present proposals fail,and for- a general policy for India in that event.    For the-reasons given below,  it is  :..ueh namely difficult to predictthe course of events, and impossible to have a cut-and-driedscheme to meet all the various situations that may arise.It must be remembered that India&apos; is very nearly theslse of Europe, and contains an even greater diversity ofpeoples and languages,  and that there are many different forms of government.    The South of India v.ill behave in anentirely different way from the North;    the reaction of theStates  ,vill not be the some as in British India;    Bengalhas its can popularities, and so forth.    There are otheruncertain or intangible factors,  e.g.  the attitude of theIndianAhrmy,  the staunchness &apos;of the Police,  the value of theasset of prestige, and  so on.2.      The general political situation in the country may bebriefly described as follows.    The principal party, theCongress, which has long been a purely revolutionary movement;,devoted almost entirely to agitation, suddenly sees power        twithin its grasp and is not suite able to believe it yet.    Theleaders are still mistrustful    of our intention, and believethat we may take away from there what is offered and startanother period of repression if we do not like what they do.They are therefore determined to grasp all the power they canas quickly as possible, and to try to make it impossible forus to take it back&quot;.    It Is as if a starving prisoner, wassuddenly offered unlimited quantities of food by his gaoler;his instinct is to seize it all at once and to guard ngainst, it being taken away again;    also to mat as much and as quickly as possible,  an &quot;action which. Is bound, to have ill effects on.his he;: 1th,There are many internal stresses in the Congress;    andthe section which is for constructive work finds difficultyin controlling the section whose ideas still run entirely on.agitation and destruction.    Over it all broods the influence of Mr.  Gandhi,  a pure political opportunist, and an extremelyskilful one, v/hose guiding principle is to get rid of thehated British influence out of India as soon as possible.Congress will probably hold together as long as it is in opposition but is likely to split Up when it comes into power.The-; real, objective of the Congress,  certainly of the left Wing extremists,  is not, at the present,  so much to makea constitution,  as to obtain, control and power at the Centre.Their plan is to delay the formation of a constitution until they have obtained, control at the Centre, have succeeded in getting British troops end British influence removed from thecountry,  and have gained over the Indian Army and the IndianPolice forces as their instrument.    They then intend to dealwith the Muslims and the Princes   rt their leisure, and to makea constitution that accords with their ideas.    They will notswerve from this objective.    Whether the moderate element inthe Congress can. control them,  or wishes to,  is uncertain.-1-

3.     The Muslim League is deeply suspicious of Congressunder its present leadership, wad wore particularly of Sir, Gandhi.I think the Muslim League would bo prepared to work with the moderate Congress element, if it could, get rid of .its ewtr . meLeft and of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s influence.    The former is onlylikely to-be removed by n violent conflict,  the latter only by -the normal process of a non-violent old age.    So long a;;1,the Left-wing of Congress continue to exercise influence,and Mr. Gandhi throws his authority unaccountably to one side or the other,  it is gain   to be almost impossible toobtain Muslim-Hindu co-operation,h.      Of the minorities, the Sikhs are the most important fromthe point of view of this appreciation,  since they occupy   -a key position in the Punjab and can be dangerously violent.They are much divided both in politics and in space;    and their actions are never easily discernible.    They are an important element in the Indian army.5.      The great mass of the Indian people desire to go -about their&quot; affairs peaceably;    few of them have any feeling againstthe British,  whom they have looked upon as protectors formany years;    and they do not realise what is happening,  or what disorder or misfortunes threaten the country if lav/ -aid-order break down.    They are, however, ignorant, and easily andsuddenly swayed to violent passion and action;    and there in,in every large town and in many country districts,  a dangerouselement who are accustomed to live -aid profit by violence    adare ready tools in the hands of any agitator.    Hatred againstthe British could soon and easily be roused;    and there wouldthen be considerable danger to isolated British officials,planters,  etc.6.      The Rulers of States are perplexed and anxious;    they realise that their former protectors-   the British, are going,,that they will be subject to the agitation of Congress, and thatthe end of their autocracy and easy living is in sight.In any conflict or disturbances, the States would in -all probability remain goner filly friendly to the British.    Hyderabadfor irista IMC -3 a  W ould welcome tie   retention of British troopsin Secunderabad,  and Mysore would certainly be unlikely toraise any objection about their remaining in Bangalore;    thesetwo places have important airfields which might be of great value to us,7.      It is impossible to tell how or when trouble  Is likelyto come.    It may take the form of very serious communal rioting^owing to tins Congress and the Muslim League being quite unableto come to terms.    The chief areas would probably be the Punjab,the IT.P., arid Bengal.    Rioting in the Punjab would be likely totake the most severe form,  since  nie peoples of the Punjab are more naturally violent than elsewhere in India.    It would alsobe serious in the U.P.  and Bihar,  and these two provinces,which might be termed the &quot;Mutiny&quot; provinces, where the trouble was greatest both in 1837 ana 19h2, are probably more anti-British than any others, with the CP. a good third.    Communalrioting in Bengal would take place mainly in the large eita.. s,e.g,  Calcutta and Dacca,  since in the countryside the two communities are generally separated.    Troublesome factors anserious disorders in the U.P.  and Bihar are that the maincommunications in India from east to west run through theseprovinces,  also that they cut off Nepal from India,

Or trouble may tone the form of a mass movement against british authority,either by m tabus or by Muslims,  or by bath.. This is  dealt with in more detail later on.almost all one can say for certain is  that if serious trouble does come,  it will come with great suddenness sadunaccbuntability.    I have had seme experience of  eastern-uprisings;    in Egypt in 1919J    in Palestine in 1937-38;    inIraq. in&apos;l9hl;    in India in 19b2 and recently in the Calcuttaand Bombay riots.    111 these came suddenly, violently and eithlittle warning;    On the other hand they were all suppressedwith comparative ease;    curiously enough,  the least organised,the smallest and the least violent - the Arab uprising in1937-38 - was perhaps, apart from the difficulties of thecountry,  the most troublesome to leal with.    This was probably due to the fact that it had not been sufficiently firmlyhandled at the original outbreak a year before.A widespread mass movement,  sponsored by the whole: forceof the Congress, would be likely soon to take a violent form..,even if nominally begun on non-violent lines;    aril it wouldprobably be beyond our resources to suppress it,  at leastwithout very considerable reinforcements of British troops.8.      In all  this uncertainty,  our best plan is to have certain definite.principles on which to act in the varyingconditions that may arise.    I suggest that these may bo 3sfollows;(1) Our task is to give India self-government as quickly as possible without disorder and chaos.    We mustinduce them to establish a Constitution for ituia,get them into the  o:.addle:, guide them during the interim period, and help them in every possible way;(2) So long as we retain responsibility for governmentin any part of India, we must perform the mose essential task of any Government., and maintainlav. and order with determination by all themeans at our command.    In particular, we mustprotect British Lives and property;(3) It will not be: advisable to risk another conflict with Congress as a whole;    if they sponsor a massmovement on a wide scale,  it will probably be extremely difficult  to repress it;    and anotherperiod of repression will lead us nowhere unless we are prepared to stop In India for the next tenor twenty years.    If there is a really widespreadmovement against our rule,  we should try and secure an orderly withdrawal:, but not necessarilyfrom all India,  certainly not from all India atone e;(b) We must never,  however,  allow ourselves to be placedin the position of helping the Congress to coerce the muslim Provinces;(5) We should remember that there are still plenty of people in India who are anxious for peace said will support the Government in its maintenance of lawand order provided it shows itself firm and resolute.We must nod allow ourselves to be deterred from doing the rigt.it thing through fear of provoking thee x. t r e me el eiaie nt s,

9.      The military pier, to meet the event of serious troubleprovides for our holding on on in the last resort to theprincipal ports - Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Karachi - end toDelhi.&quot; .1 agree that this is the only sound plan.    Thescheme also provides for the collection if necessary ofE:ux6&quot;oeans from points of danger.    It does not of course mean that&quot;we in Send to withdraw at once at the first outbreakof trouble,  simply that these are the vital points whichwe apropos e, to; hold whatever happens, .0it may be necessary at a later stage to transfer our^troops from southern India to the north (see paragraph 11).10,    If the above estimate of the situation, general principles and military plan are accepted, it remains to consider theirpi&apos;aetioal application.If it were the firm policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government,that,  in the event of the main parties failing to agree and,either or both launching a movement against the authorityof the existing British rule,  it should be suppressed, Ishould be prepared to attempt this, and believe it would havea Chance of succeeding, if His Majesty&apos;s Government supportnie with all forces they could make available and give me -free hand to take all measures necessary to restore order,e.g.   the proclamation of Martial Law and the use of all force at my disposal.    It would be essential for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make a clear statement of this policy and ofits determination to enforce it..(I assume, however,  that in the state of public opinion,at home and abroad, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not -wish-to adopt such a policy.A policy of immediate withdrawal of our authority, influence and power from India, unconditionally, would to my mini be disastrous and even more fatal to the traditions and morale of our people and to our -position in the world than a policyof repression,    I &apos;could not consent to carry out such a policy.It remains to examine -whether any middle course between&quot;repression&quot; and &quot;scuttle&quot; can be found, if we are unable to persuade the Indians to agree to a peaceful settlement of theirC onstitu ti on,&apos;11.    We wast at all costs avoid becoming embroiled with bothHindu and Muslim at once.    Hor do I think that we can possiblyaccept the position of assisting the Hindus, that is theCongress, to force their will on the Muslims;    that would be fatal to our whole position in the Muslim&apos;world, and would bean injustice.The alternative is that, if we are forced into an extremeposition, we should hand over the Hindu -provinces, by agreement and as peaceably as possible, to ifindu rule, withdrawing our troops,  officials and nationals in an orderly manner;    and should at the same time support the Muslim provinces of India againstHindu domination and assist them to work out their ownconstitution.

If such were our general policy,, we should mo.Ice it quite clear to the Congress at the appropriate time that this would heour policy and that &quot;it  eould result in the division of India.This&quot;might compel them to come to terms with the Muslim League.12.      There are obvious difficulties and dangers in such apolicy.    It is possible that the Muslins might decline our assistance,  though I think it is unlikely;    it would mean the division of the Indian Army;    and our military position in theN.iV.  and of India would be weak,  as a permanency, as teeC.-in-C.  has pointed out.    Tin   actual military operation of withdrawl from Hindustan into Pakistan would be difficult andpossibly dangerous.Further,  we should have the  large minorities, Hindus andSikhs,  to deal with in the Muslim provinces;    and we should havehad to abandon our responsibility to minorities, and our own interests, in Hinduston.Nevertheless I can see no better policy available;    andif it were carried out firmly, I think it would succeed.13.    The position of the States and of Nepal in such a policy must be considered.The principal southern States, Mysore, Travoncore andCochin, would probably have no difficulty in finding aninfluential position in southern India.    The Pastern and central States would have to come  to terms with the C.P.and Orissa.Kashmir, Baluchistan and the Punjab States would remain within the British spjliere of influence in the North-west.; *ahd Sikkim, Bhutan, Cooch-Behar, Manipur, etc.,  in the North-east,assuming that we still retained control in the North-east.There remain to bo considered Rajputana,  some of the CentralIndian States,  such, as Gwalier;    the &quot;Western States,  andHyderabad.The rulers of Hyderabad would undoubtedly wish to remainin the British orbit;    but with its - geographical position -andpredominantly Hindu population, it would not be possible orappropriate for it to do so.    &quot;we might remain in Hyderabadtemporarily,  to assist the Nizam to obtain suitable terras inHindustan, but we should certainly be there for the shortest possible time.    In Sajputana the action taken would depend onthe influence the Rulers wore able to exert over their subjects.The Rulers would wish, to remain in the British orbit, andgeographically could do so;    &quot;but their peoples are mainly Hindu.The same would apply to some  of the Central Indian States, -eg.Gwalior, Phopal.fbe vVo.stern India States would probably make terms withBombay,  though some might adhere  to British influence, e.g.Cut oh.Nepal would be cut off the British sphere, and would presumably make terms with Hindustan..    It is not suggested that this arrangement should be apermanency;    and that we should maintain indefinitely what would amount to a &apos; Northern Ireland&apos;   in India.    We should endeavourto bring about a Union of India on the best terms possible;and then withdraw altogether.

Hi.    The formation of nn Interim Govtmnrant is likely tc bethe crux of the whole problem.If both the mo in parties come in, and really try tc   a. rkthe government,  all may go well..I think we may dismiss the contingency of the muslim league agreeing to participate in the Interim Government,while the Congress declines,  since I  cannot conceive that aGovernment forme! -without Congress agreement could exerciseauthority in the Hindu provinces.The difficult situation rill arise if the Congress agrees to take part in ah Interim Government while the Muslim Leaguedeclines.    It will be very difficult to refuse to form aGovernment with Congress members&apos; and again to allow Jinna-to hold up all progress.    Mt the same time to give controlof all India to a Government in which Muslims refused  be t ,kepart would be very dangerous.    It would be likely to lead tograve disorders in the Punjab and Bengal,  and -would beinjurious to our whole position in the Muslim world.    I could probably get a number of non-Congress. non-League Muslims tojoin the Government, but with the League standing out thewrit of such a eovernment Would probably not run in the Punjabor Bengal;    and there would be serious disorders.It might be possible to form a Government temporarily,with non-League Muslims taking the seats reserved for the   ouslimLeague in the hope that this might induce the League to breakaway from Jinnah&apos;s control,  or make Jinnah reconsider hisrefusal.If this fails,  a possible solution might be to a lie    the hindus to form a Hindustan C-e-err..rent for all the Congressprovinces;    and the League to form one for the Muslimprovinces;    while the Centre was a purely official Government,carrying on as a Union Government,  until the two Hindustanand Pakistan Governments could agree  on terms of Union orSeparation.adie dangers of sue!&apos;, a solution are obvious, but it mightoe possible to work out a temporary arrangement on such lines.15.    given supposing that we succeed in forming a CoalitionInterim Government and the Constituent assembly formed,  ourtroubles will by no means be over.    There is also sure to be-in an Interim Government controlled &quot;by the Congress a continuous attempt to sap British authority in every possible way.    A real Coalition Government might avoid.this, as theMuslims and other Minorities would not wish British influence to be lessened or removed.    It is, however, likely thai itwill be difficult to hold together either the interim government or the Assembly.    /. 11 we can. do then is, I think,to f.11 back on the policy outlined in paragraphs 11-13.
