(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3-GOVERNMENT)secret-SLJOLTCP,   (46)  202 COPY NO,22ND MAY,   1946CABINETREPORT ON MISSION TO THE U.S.  AND CANADA&apos; &quot; BY THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE council I attach for the information of my colleaguesa report on my Mission to the United States and canada-HAM.Offices of the Lord President of the Council.22AD May,   191+6.

REPORT ON MISSION TO THE UNITES STATES AND CANADABJLATM LORD PRESIDENT OF THE council I have now completed the Mission    to the UnitedStates and Canada on world food supplies which I undertookat the request of the Cabinet (CM. (h6)U3rd Conclusions,Minute 2).2.      I left Northolt at 8.U0p.m.  B.S.T.  on 11th May and reached Washington at 11.55 E.S.T.   on the following(Sunday) morning.    Mr. Hoover arrived almost at the samemoment from his world famine tour.    After being welcomed &apos; .by Mr. Clayton I lunched with Lord Halifax and conferred with British officials about the Mission.3.      The following morning,  after a short talk withMr. Dean Acheson,  I  called on the President and had apremising reception from him,  as described in telegramNo.3118 to the Foreign Office.    In the afternoon I met mr..  Clayton and Mr.  Clinton Anderson and officials of theState Department, and U.S. Department of Agriculture,  as described in telegram No.3119 from Washington to ForeignOffice.    By this stage it became apparent that the americans were just as concerned about the famine situation as wetwere and that the vast and increasing public pressure was just bringing them to - the point where they were preparedto put over necessary measures even at the expense oftreading on the toes&apos;of vested interests such as the millers,  the bakers,  and above all the Farm Bloc.    They (were,  however,  somewhat resentful at what they regardedas an overseas campaign to represent America as a selfishand glutton!sh country which was making no serious attemptto help its neighbours;    and while accepting as a matterof logic that each country&apos;s action in the realm of foodwas of vital interest to others they were not veryenthusiastic about working out the implications by lettingus discuss  their agriculture and food economy policies as fully as I was ready to let them discuss curs.    Theseinhibitions,  however, soon yielded to treatment and on thelUth May officials on both sides held a serioa of very useful meetings in the Department of Agriculture at which one&apos; working party went over the United States and U.K.position while a second examined the prospective re quire -rnents and supplies of bread grains for May to September,19u7 on a world-wide basis but with particular referenceto India,  Japan and Germany.    As a result of very intensiveeffort reports were completed in time for a second toplevel meeting on Wednesday attended by Mr.  Clayton, bustnot Mr. Clinton Andersen.    The Canadian Ambassador alsotook part.

U.      As described in Washington telegram 3193 difficultycentred on the question of handling the 3.d million tonsbread grains deficit during May/September 1946.    It proved possible to reach agreement on the instructions to be given from the Ministerial level&apos; to the working party about thebasis on which cuts were to be examined except in the caseof the United Kingdom, where I argued strongly against anycut while the Americans considered, that some reduction shouldbe possible through economies in management of stockswithout involving any cuts in U.K.  consumption,- which theystrergly disclaimed any wish to see.    On the following day,Thursday,  the working party reported and the final top levelcommittee meeting with Mr. Clayton and Mr. Anderson   andthe Canadian Ambassador present,  took place in the after-noon.    The argument was stiff and prolonged, but the friendly arid courteous atmosphere which had been maintained on botlf sides throughout stood the strain,  and the deadlockwas discussed without ill-feeling.    As the Americans wereprepared to meet us so fully on the Common treatment ofGermany and on fair treatment for India,  so far as physicalsupplies permit,  and as other countries (including the U.S.)all claimed to be managing on a very much lower level of stocks than ourselves,  it seemed to me that we would lose&apos;far more than we would gain by allowing negotiations tobreak on the point of some reduction in the U.K. programme,particularly since it was clear ti me from my independentenquiries into American public opinion that the U.S.Administration would have the greatest difficulty injustifying shipments to the U.K.  at the full level necessaryto cover our current consumption and to rebuild our stocks to the 750,000 level while much&apos;of the world, was starving.5.      The Americans at no time hinted that it was in their power to force a reduction on the U.K. by the simple processof not shipping us wheat which we could not then get fromanywhere else,  but the point was very much present in my mind and in that of my official advisers from the Ministriesof Food and Agriculture, who    cabled to their Ministers onthis point.    I finally said that while I could not answerfor my colleagues I would recommend this cut to them and Ithereupon sent to the Prime Minister cables Nos.32-32 and3233 which were considered in a most&apos; helpful&apos; and expeditiousmanner by the Cabinet (CM. (U6) U9th Conclusions), which enabled me to report to the President on Friday 17th May,that agreement had been reached on all points.6.      The President&apos;s attitude on this occasion was again veryfriendly and he had evidently been fully informed of theconclusions at his Cabinet meeting earlier in the morning.I was glad to find that he assented to all my points (as reported in cable No. 3-292 from Washington) withouthesitation which indicated that not only Mr. Clayton, but mr. Clinton Anderson, must have left him in no doubt thatin committing himself he could count on their support in implementing what had been agreed.    As implementation is somuch of the battle where agreements with the United StatesGovernment on matters of this sort are concerned, I was veryrelieved to have been able to leave officials on the spotwith such a  favourable atmosphere in which to apply theagreement.

7.      As a further reinforcement, I persuaded the americans to agree to an unusually full announcement setting forth in neutral terms v/hat both Governments are doing and outlining the main points on which agreement had been reached (see annex    I).    I gave a Press Conference on this immediatelyafter leaving the President, but it was only just before mytrain started that word reached me of clearance having beengiven for publication by  the United States Government&apos;.&apos;8.      I devoted considerable attention to publicity andmet a number of the leading editors,  columnists and otherjournalists on various occasions.    We had long and frankexchanges which I hope will have cleared up a number of current misunderstandings.    I also had an opportunity to deliver a C.B.S. broadcast which I observe was reported hereto have been ignored by the American press.    So far as i know it is the custom of the press all over the world to ignore broadcasts&apos; unless there is some particular news itemor sensational element which makes a report on it; essential.The Columbia Broadcasting System are now reported (in P0.333J+from Washington received after my return)  to have beenenthusiastic about the broadcast and to have stated thatthey have received no single complaint from any source.I see also that the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that my visit -was resented in the United. States;  if so I can only say thatall concerned showed an un-American skill in concealing thefact from me.9.      In addition to members of the U.S.  Government I hadinterviews with Mr. Hoover,  as reported in No.3195 from washington, and also saw Mr. La Guardia,  the Director-Generalof UNNPA and M.  Monnet.10.    I left Washington via New York for Ottawa on the 17th May,and after considerable delay, due to exceptionally badflying weather,  reached Montreal in time to see Mr.  James Gardiner,  the Canadian Minister of Agriculture andhis deputy Dr. Barton on their way through to Washington.Mr.  Gardiner was helpful, although a little guarded in his attitude,  and accepted my explanation that the 200,000 cut in the U.K. programme was most unlikely to involve anydiversion of Canadian wheat to Germany and that the agreement as a whole would in fact do much to remove the circumstances which, have made last minute diversions of Canadian wheat from the U.K.  inevitable.    I then proceeded to Ottawa wherethe Canadian Government held a Sunday afternoon conference with me presided over by Mr. J.A. MacKinnon, Minister of Tradeand Commerce,    Attended by my officials I went over all thepoints on which we hove been concerned about Canadianagriculture which proved to have been in every case prettyfully considered by the Canadians, who were able to givefairly satisfactory answers,.  I was, however, much disturbedto hear that,  owing to lack of rain on the prairies the new crop was in danger of being seriously injured.    Following themeeting a working party produced that evening a draft announcement, which I -approved the following morning,and     which was approved with very slight changes by theCanadian Cabinet just before my departure.    I also saw theCanadian Press  and made two broadcasts before taking off forMontreal soon after 2 p.m. E.D.T.11,    I reached Northolt at 12.2.5 p. in. 3.3. S. T.   on 21st May,after a short stop at Gander,  Newfoundland,  where HisExcellency the Governor &quot;made a special journey from St. Johnsto meet me.

Washington Press Announce me, n t -British and American officials announced jointlytoday that they had reached agreement on guiding principles, which their two Governments should adopt in their commoneffort to solve the man;&apos;&apos; immediate and longer range problems arising in connexion with the world food crisis.The announcement was made on the departure of Mr.HerbertM orris o ni M.P., Lord President of the Council, who hadflown from London early this week to discuss thewheat crisis with President Truman and other high officials of the United States Government,  including Mr. Anderson, theSecretary of Agriculture,  and Mr. Clayton, assistant secretary of State for Economic Affairs.        Mr.  L.B. Pearson,Canadian Ambassador in Washington,  and other Canadianofficials were also, present at the Conferences.      Mr. herbert morrison is now proceeding to Ottawa where he will discuss with the Canadian Government the matters discussed in washington and other food problems.The object of Mr. Morrison&apos;s visit to Washingtonwas to review the efforts which the two Governments ofthe United Kingdom and the United States have been making to combat world famine, -to agree on general lines of future policy and to solve certain f mnediate problems of common concern.The two Governments are agreed that even moreenergetic measures are needed throughout the world to-secure effective and complete removal of all threat to world famine and that their plans in this respect must bebased on the assumption that this threat will continue at least through the summer harvest of 1947.   The twoGovernments are further agreed to consult together in thefuture as in the past on the initiation or removal of any measures of major importance undertaken by them as a contribution to the world effort to prevent famine.      Thetwo Governments have reviewed the requirements and avail-abilities of bread grains for the period May-September,19u7.      The maximum supplies presently in sight for thisperiod amount to only 10,000,000 tons. The total statedrequirements for this period were 13.h million tons.    Thereis &quot;an indicated deficiency,  therefore,  of 3.I4 million tonsor about 25 per cent.This deficiency makes it inevitable that severecuts should be made in requirement;:,   as previously stated.Recomvaendations to this end will be submitted to the combined Pood Board by the two Governments-      In preparingthose recommendations the two Governments have made regardto the extent to which the forthcoming new crops can bemobilised with sufficient speed to relieve the worst ofthe strain.        Even after severe cuts there would be a gapof something under one million tons between such roquire-ments and available supplies.      It will have to berecognised that the cuts-,  proposed, in the recommendationsmust inevitably cause hardship and a risk of famine remains.

This risk can ho reduced in so far as other sources ofsupply can he found in addition to those at present insight and the two Governments are resolved to-do everything in their power to secure these -additional supplies.The United Kingdom representatives have reportedfully on the measures of consumer rationing and othereconomies currently in effect in the United Kingdom whichmay he &quot;briefly summarised as follows.Consumer rationing has been continued and in thecase of fats, &quot;bacon,  dried eggs, meat and preserves, rationshave been reduced below the austere low wartime levels,nations of the British forces in the United Kingdom havetwice been cut since V.E. Day.Since the beginning of 19I46 the follov:/ing measures have been introdticed(a) Increase in the extraction rate of flour.1.    From 80 per cent to 82? per cent on February 2U ;2.    From &amp;2:k per cent to 85 per cent on March 10 ;3.    From 85 per cent to 90 per cent during the most critical period May-September..(b) Reduction in supplies of grain for snirit distillingfrom 300,000 tons to 130,000 tons.(c) Reduction in the size of the standard loaf from 2 lb.to 11 lb.( d) Reduction&apos;of 25 per cent in production of biscuitsand similar products.- 4(e) Reduction of production of cake and flour confectioneryby reduction of 2.5 per cent in allocations of sugar and fatsfor this purpose.( f)    Reduction of beer production to 90 per cent of prewarproduction in terms of standard barrels.( g)    Inauguration of a campaign to secure a reduction inwastage of food.In order to increase the output of bread grainsthe United Kingdom has continued its wartime policy ofland utilisation,crop production and disposal with theeffect of encouraging cereal production at the expense of livestock.        The feeding of mi liable wheat to livestockcontinues to be prohibited.The following measures have been introduced sincethe beginning of 19u7.(1)    Payment of a grant of 2 per acre in respect of the ploughing up for the 19u7 harvest of grassland which hasbeen clown for three years or longer.

(2)    Increase of 1/9 per cwt.  in price of wheat from the19U7 harvest.(3) *Reintroduction of directions to grow wheat for I9U7harvest in order to secure a minimum target of 2.5 million acres.      This means.return to the position prevailing upto and including the 19h7 harvest. Directions to growpotatoes and sugar &quot;beet have been&apos;maintained throughout.(h)    Reduction in-rations for pigs and poultry as from the1st of Kay from the basis of one quarter of prewar numbers tone-sixth of prewar numbers and to one-twelfth as from 1st July.      (It had been originally intended to increasethe rations as from 1st may to the basis of one-third ofprewar numbers).As a part of the measures necessary to reduce the deficit in world supplies the United Kingdom has agreedto reduce its stated requirements already screened tothe minimum necessary to maintain its lowered consumptionlevel by another 200,000 tons.  This may involveeither a reduction in pipeline stocks to a point at whichdistribution may be interrupted with consequent disruptionof the industrial economy or still further restrictionson the austere diet maintained in the United Kingdom forthe  six years since the beginning of the war.The United States representatives reported on themeasures taken in the United States to achieve, greaterproduction and to switch agriculture and available suppliesaway from the wartime emphasis on livestock products andover to a maximum production of bread grains directed tohuman consumption.      Among other measures the United states has taken the following steps, to attain maximum exportsof grain.(1) Substantial increases in- the ceiling prices of grainfor export to replace earlier export premiums of 30 centsper bushel on wheat and corn.(2)    Increase of the extraction rate of flour to 80 per cent(3)    Limitation on millers&apos;inventories including grainpurchased and in transit to a 21 day supply.      Actualinventories are in many cases even less, averaging two weeks supply with some of the big mills already shut down.(U)    Prohibition of the use of wheat and wheat products for alcoholic beverages and severe &quot;curtailment of such useof other grains including limitation to 2l\ hours run per month in the manufacture of alcohol and a cut in beerproduction to 70 per cent of the 19U5 level.( 5)    Restriction on the purchase of grain and grain productsby livestock feeders to amounts designed to limit the weight of hogs and cattle and the numbers of poultry.(6)    Limitation of the use of grain by mixed feed manu-facturers to 80 per cent of the 19U-5 use.

(7)    A similar 80&apos;per cent limitation on the use of corn orsorgmun   grain in syrups etc.The United States production problem differs fromthe British in that it requires an extensive change fromagricultural policy established to meet wartime demandsinstead of a further development along wartime lines as in thecase of Great Britain.      The measures recently adopted fordiverting grain into human consumption and for cutting downconsumption in livestock are only now beginning to have their full effect.The two Governments re-affirm their belief thatcommon measures should be taken in all zones of Germany withrespect to the collection of indigenous foodstuffs, the setting of common ration standards and the adoption of acommon basis for calculating import requirements.      Sincethe timing of these measures must be left to agreement in thefield,  the British and American Zone Commanders will be immediately requested to set in motion the necessary consultations to achieve these objectives in theirrespective zones and the French Zone (these being theareas for which the Combined Food Board makes- allocations) .It was also deemed desirable that the ration scale in theBritish and French Zones of Germany should be adjustedupwards to the level prevailing in the United States Zoneat the earliest feasible date and to this end full andintensified efforts should be continued in each sone to achieve maximum utilisation of food resources.      It is also agreed that special emphasis should be placed on miners&apos;rations in order to secure a maximum output of coal.The United States Government has reviewed theJapanese import programme in order to ensure that except to the extent that the Supreme Commander of the AlliedPowers determines that imports are essential immediatelyfor the safety of the occupation forces,  no imports shallbe permitted which will have the effect of giving to theJapanese a priority or preferential treatment over therequirements of the people of any Allied Power or liberatedarea.      The conclusion has been reached in the discussions that the low level of feeding contemplated by the current programme may not suffice even if fully met,  to provide theminimum essential for the  safety of the occupation forces.

Ottawa Press Announcement-Discussions of the world food situation havetaken place over the weekend between members of theCanadian Government and ilr. Herbert Morrison, H.F.,Lord President of the Council,  of the United Kingdom,who came to Ottawa for this purpose following similardiscussions with United States representatives in washington at which the Canadian Ambassador was present.The Canadian Government has taken note of thejoint statement issued by the United Kingdom and theUnited States on Hay 17th,  following Mr.Morrison&apos;discussions in Washington and has expressed general agree-ment with the proposals it contains for continuingconsultation and collaboration to meet the world foodcrisis.During the discussions in Ottawa the steps already taken by Canada and the United Kingdom to alleviate the disastrous effects of world food shortages were reviewed and broad lines of future policy were discussed.The maximum supplies of bread grains that are.at present likely to be available from May through September,19L6,  have been assessed at  some ten million tons,  of which canada expects to supply 2.3 million tons.  Screened requlre-ments for the same period were expected to total 13.ilmillion tons leaving a deficiency of 3.I4. million tons or abou25 per cent.      A. further intensive review and scaling down of these requirements to the barest minimum needs are likelyto reduce the gap over this 5 month period to something under one -million tons.    Inevitably severe hardship will resultand great- danger of famine will continue.      Trie canadian government has agreed.to associate itself with the UnitedKingdom and the United States Governments in maintainingconstant review of the situation,  and to put forth its best,efforts to secure and make available additional supplies of grain.The Canadian Ministers described the comprehensive .programme of agricultural production and of conservation offood which their Government is carrying out to meet this situation.        In anticipation of the urgent world need for food that would arise immediately following the conclusionof the war,1 Canadian food   production had been expandedduring the war years.      This high rate of expanded produc-tion has been maintained and in some cases even increased.Wheat acreage has been raised to a very high level.Rationing and restrictions on sales of certain foods tohelp provide -more for export were continued and even extended,meat rationing was r-e imposed.       Complete control ofagricultural products in particular grains has been retained in order to ensure that as much food as possible may be madeavailable to the hungry of other nations.When, -some months ago,  it became apparent thatthe expected serious food situation in the world would be

greatly aggravated, by drought in large areas, and- by-other difficulties,  the Canadian Government toot, stillfurther steps to meet the threat of famine.      On March 17ththe Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King,  announced anine-point programme- upon which the Canadian Governmenthad decided in order to increase supplies of foodstuffsfor export,   &quot; This programme included:1 .      Reduction by 10% below 19h7 of -wheat released for human consumption in Canada.2.      Reduction by 50;b of wheat released for distilleries.3- Special income tax arrangements to encourage immediatemarketing of wheat stored on farms.U.      Measures to release increased quantities of oats andHo.  k wheat for export.5- Special priorities for railexport.6. Modification of regulationsflour and feed.transport of wheat foraffecting bulk shipment ofI&apos;      A campaign to urge Canadian farmers to plan their production to obtain the maximum yield of foodstuffs overthe next four years.8. A campaign for the reduction of inventories of wheat and wheat products. (9.      A campaign to encourage consumer savings,  avoidance ofwaste and development of home gardens.This programme has been put into effect and. isalready producing encouraging results.      Other specialaction has also been taken by the Government.      For example,further wheat is being diverted from producers of bothpotable and industrial alcohol to the extent that substitutesbecomes available;      additional efforts to reduce use ofwheat for animal feeds are being made.The United Kingdom representatives doscribed theefforts being put forth in the United Kingdom.    Consumerrationing has been continued and over a wide field, rationsare now below low wartime levels.      The rations of home basedUnited Kingdom forces have been r educed.      The extraction rate of flour has been raised, several times and. will bemaintained at 90% during the critical May to September period.Supplies of grain for distilling have been cut from 300,000tons to 130,000 tons.      The size of loaves has been reduced,while production of biscuits,  cakes and pastry has been substantially curtailed.      Beer production has been set at90^i of prewar production.       Cereal production is being encouraged and a number of special directions and inducementshave recently been introduced to this end.      Feeding ofmi liable wheat to livestock remains prohibited and. rations

for livestock have been, cut down.      Consumers are being encouraged to conserve food and to reduce waste.Further,  the United Kingdom has recently agreedto forego another 200,000 tons of imports which will thus be released for use elsewhere.      This has been done with full awareness of the dangers to the United. Kingdom in theway of still further interruptions of distribution orrestrictions on the austere diet obtaining in the UnitedKingdom for the six years since the beginning of the war.The Canadian and United Kingdom Governmentsagree that ever;/ effort must be put forth to removecompletely the threat of world famine,  a threat which&apos;&quot;willcontinue at least until the harvests of 19U7 become avail-able.      The two Governments agree that they will continueto collaborate through the Combined Food Board or other appropriate agencies to this end.      Tboy will continue to consult on measures of major importance which may befound necessary to meet the present world food shortage.
