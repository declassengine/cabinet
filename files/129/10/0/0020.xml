H. H.Colonial Office,Downing Street, S.W. 1,Qth June, 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 220.Qth June, 1946.A rab Higher Committee,Jerusalem, 2nd May, 1946.British Prime Minister, London.Through his Excellency, the High Commissioner, Jerusalem.ON the occasion of the declaration of the Anglo-American Joint Committeeof Enquiry&apos;s report in connection with the case of Palestine, the Arab higher committee convened a meeting on the 1st May, 1946, at which they decided onthe refusal of the proposals embodied in the above-mentioned report.The Arab Higher Committee does not consider this report to have been theresult of free and innocent enquiry, but to have been made under clear pressure of Anglo-American policy; and there is no doubt that the execution of theseproposals would threaten the existence and national life of the Arab nation.It (execution of the proposals) would mean, in addition to this, the suppression of our natural right to determine our destiny, the breach of the promise made by Britain to the Arabs and the contradiction of the democratic principles of the Atlantic Charter for which the Allies have fought. The ArabHigher Committee, therefore, confirms the Arab people&apos;s determination inPalestine-to defend their country by all means in their power.Awaiting the British Government&apos;s decision in connection with above-mentioned proposals, the Arab nation will proceed in mobilising its national forces and preparing the means for the defence of itself, to resume the nationalmovement fight. The Arab nation will not hesitate to adopt an attitude whichwill lead to the checking of the approaching danger and realise freedom and independence for them. ;In view of all this the Arab Higher Committee considered it essential tosubmit to your Government this warning, demanding the rejection of theabove-mentioned proposals and the realisation of all our national demands.Respects,(Signed) JEMEL HUSSEINI.[31951]
