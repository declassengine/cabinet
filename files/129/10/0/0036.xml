THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   g QCP. (46) 236.20th June, 1946.CABINET.AMENDMENT OF THE LAW RELATING TO THE  nationality of MARRIED WOMEN.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.1. Successive Governments in the United Kingdom have for many years been pressed to amend the existing law under which a woman takes on marriagethe nationality of her husband. The main obstacle to legislation has been the lackof agreement among the self-governing members of the Commonwealth, but it now appears that this obstacle no longer exists and that South Africa, Canada,Australia and New Zealand are prepared to agree to the law being so changed asto provide (a) that a British woman on marriage to a foreigner, whether she doesor does not acquire his nationality under the laws of his country, shall not lose herBritish nationality, unless she takes some overt step to renounce it; and (b) that aforeign woman on marriage to a British subject shall not thereby acquire british nationality, but shall have the right to apply for it, and that if she applies the granting or withholding of British nationality shall be within the discretion ofthe authorities of the country concerned (in the United Kingdom the authority would be the Home Secretary).We recommend that these changes in the law should be approved by theUnited Kingdom Government, and that communications should be sent to theGovernments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, asking fortheir concurrence, so that a public statement may be made showing that thedifficulty has been removed which in the past prevented legislation on this subject.2. Canada has already legislated to give effect to these changes, and they intend to bring their Act into operation by Proclamation on the 1st January next.Australia also has just passed an Act which provides that a British womanresident in Australia shall on marriage to a foreigner retain her british nationality under Australian law. In the past South Africa has been an opponentof the changes, but at the recent meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers Field-Marshal Smuts took the initiative in raising the question of amending the law.It was agreed at the meeting of the Dominion Prime Ministers that there shouldbe informal talks between officials on this and other nationality questions, and asa result of these talks it appeared that, if these changes were approved by theUnited Kingdom Government and communications were then sent to the otherGovernments, replies expressing concurrence would be received from South africa and New Zealand, as well as from Canada and Australia.3. Such opposition as has existed in the United Kingdom to these changeshas in the past been based mainly on the principle that the nationality of husband and wife should normally be the same and that exceptions should only be allowedon strong grounds. A large exception has already been made by the Act of 1933,which provides that a British woman shall not lose her British nationality on marriage to a foreigner, unless she thereby acquires the nationality of her husbandunder the laws of his country. Moreover, the Act of 1918 provides that a British-born woman married to an &quot; enemy &apos;&apos; alien may at the discretion of the HomeSecretary be re-admitted to British nationality, and has thus created theanomalous situation that in time of war a woman married to an &quot; enemy &apos;&apos; alienis placed in a more favourable position than a woman married to a national of an allied or neutral State.[32000]
Much publicity has been given to the sex inequalities and other defects of theexisting law, and it is unlikely that there would be serious opposition in thepresent Parliament to the proposed change.The existing law dates from the Aliens Act of 1844 and the NaturalisationAct of 1870. Before 1844 a foreign woman did not acquire British nationalityby marriage to a British subject, and before 1870 the common law prevented anyperson who was a British subject by birth from putting off his British nationality.Accordingly, a woman on marriage to an alien could not lose her british nationality even if she wished to do so.4. Importance attaches to the maintenance throughout the Commonwealthof the common status of British subject, and hitherto the common status has been maintained by the enactment in the laws of the United Kingdom and of theDominions (other than Eire) of a common code of provisions on the subject of nationality.The recent Canadian Act, however, introduces a new method of legislatingon the subject of British nationality the principle of the Canadian Act beingfirst to define what classes of persons are Canadian citizens and then to declare that Canadian citizens are British subjects. This new method of approachmakes it necessary to consider what changes, if any, shall be made in the nationality laws of the United Kingdom ana of the other Dominions, and it isproposed that a Conference of experts shall meet later in the year to consider this question.The opportunity will be taken at this Conference to try to reach agreement on the details of the new provisions which will be required to give effect to theproposed changes in the law relating to the nationality of married women.5. The question of the date at which United Kingdom legislation on thissubject may be possible cannot be settled at present. We propose to submit assoon as possible to the Cabinet a Memorandum on the far-reaching issues raisedby the Canadian Act, and, if it should ultimately be decided to make large changesin the United Kingdom law, it might be appropriate to embody new provisions relating to married women in a comprehensive measure.It will, however, be advantageous to make as early as possible a public statement about the removal of the obstacle to legislation on the nationality of married women. The Prime Minister in reply to a Parliamentary Question onthe 4th June said :  &apos;&apos; As a result of discussions at the meeting of Prime Ministers, arrange-ments were made for informal talks between officials of the Governmentsof the Dominions represented at the meeting and United Kingdom officials on nationality questions generally with special reference to the particular problem of the nationality of married women. These officials will now reportto their respective Governments and the next step will be an exchange of views between Governments for the purpose, amongst others, of overcoming the difficulties which have existed in the past regarding the national status of married women.&quot;6. We ask for the approval of our colleagues to the recommendation at theend of paragraph 1 above.J. C. E.A.Whitehall, S.W. 1,20th June, 1946.
