Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 204.23rd May, 1946.CABINET.NON-ITALIAN REFUGEES IN ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A difficult and urgent problem has arisen regarding the disposal of a largenumber of non-Italian refugees in Italy in the light of the decision which hasbeen taken by the War Office that these people must cease to be a military british responsibility on the first of next month.2. The question was discussed between the War Office and the ForeignOffice last March and it then seems to have been agreed that, as no alternativesolution could be found, the responsibility for these refugees would have to betransferred to the Italian Government when our military responsibility forthem came to an end. It is now clear, however, that this solution is open to several serious objections.3. The majority of these refugees are Yugoslavs. A considerable numberof these are known quislings or collaborators, and it is hoped that, provided the concurrence of the State Department can be obtained in time, it will be possibleto hand many of them over to the Yugoslav Government before any question of transferring them to the Italian Government arises. Even so, however, therewill be a very large number (running into several tens of thousands) of Yugoslavdissident refugees in Italy who may well constitute a serious political danger.The majority of these refugees are not war criminals or collaborators and thereis general agreement that it would be unjust to hand them over to the yugoslav government, from which they would be likely to obtain very short shrift. Manywere supporters of General Mihailovitch who are naturally &apos;&apos; wanted &apos;&apos; by theTito Government, even though many of them fought very gallantly in the war on our side. Others belong to various elements of the Royalist Yugoslav army;their position is equally difficult. Even if there are many undeserving casesamong the refugees, we have moral obligations towards the majority of them which we cannot ignore.4. But quite apart from these there is a serious political, social and evenmilitary danger in simply leaving them to become the responsibility of theItalian Government. The Italians do not possess the means to keep them incamps, to control them, or to feed them. They would, therefore, tend to scatterand form bands which would likely prey on the local population and add greatly to the difficulties of the already serious problem of the maintenance of public order in Italy. What is even worse is that most of these people are bitterlyhostile to the Tito Government in Yugoslavia. It is not impossible, therefore,that they might, if not properly controlled, organise raids into Yugoslavia whichwould greatly complicate Halo-Yugoslav relations which are already quitestrained and difficult enough. The Yugoslav Government on their side are extremely anxious to obtain the delivery of these people in order that this element of opposition to the Tito regime may be effectively liquidated. They will almost certainly bring strong pressure on the Italians to get them handed over. Asthey hold many Italian hostages, and are in a position to squeeze Italy in various ways, they may well succeed and this might lead to great injustice which wecould not condone. But an even greater danger is that these people might be exploited by ill-intentioned trouble-makers, and it is clear that anyone anxious13340      [31872]
to injure I talo-Yugoslav relations or to give the Yugoslavs the excuse for actionagainst Italy would not find it difficult to incite them to carry out provocativeacts against Yugoslavia which the Italian Government would probably be unableto prevent. Were this to happen the Yugoslav Government would have a first-class excuse for intervening in Italy., if necessary even by force, so that the already difficult question of the Italo-Yugoslav frontier might be further compli-cated, even if no worse results were to follow. In any such event it may be presumed that the Soviet Union would strongly support the Yugoslav Government,so that a new and possibly major cause of conflict between the Western Powersand Russia might well develop.5. In these circumstances it seems clear that every possible effort mustbe made on grounds of high policy, and in the interests also, in the long run,of Anglo-Russian relations to avoid a situation where these people have to be handed over to become a responsibility of the Italian Government alone.6. The War Office have pointed out that, in view of the curtailment ofman-power available, it is physically impossible for them to continue to keepthese men under British military control after the 1st June. The removal oftJhe more dangerous elements among them is the only alternative and somethingmay be done in this direction if the United States Government will consent in time to the handing over of the known quislings and collaborators. Thispoint is being pursued separately. But it must still leave a serious problem.It has been suggested that the officers might be separated from their men; butthis suggestion has proved impracticable, since it would mean ^That, there wouldbe no one to keep the men in order or to control or administrate \them. Theonly remaining solution therefore seems to be removal of these men from Italy.; 7. Suggestions have been considered for their removal to Sicily, Sardiniaor Tripolitania. In each case, however, an acute problem of supply arises, apartfrom problems of police and transport. The only destination left, therefore,seems to be the British zone in Germany. This proposal is obviously open totihe gravest objections as it is generally realised that the food problem in theBritish zone will become desperate in about a month&apos;s time, and the transferof an additional twenty to thirty thousand mouths at this moment presentsadministrative problems of very great difficulty. On the otlher hand the men will have to be fed on imported food wherever they may be, and in some ways itmay be easier to provide this food in Germany than in Italy. Moreover, trans-port from Italy to Germany, though exceedingly difficult, may present a moresoluble problem than transport overseas. If necessary at this time of the year,part of the journey could even be covered on foot. It is therefore suggestedthat the Cabinet should decide that the transfer of these men to the british zone in Germany is the lesser of the two evils with which we are confronted,and that after consultation with the United States authorities the arrangements should be made to give effect to this policy as soon as possible.8. Meanwhile, it is submitted that British military control over these menmust somehow be continued even if this involves the employment or partial useof operational troops on what are in fact base duties. The War Office pointout, however, that the present allocation of man-power to the Army is barelysufficient for the work they already have in hand, and that it would thereforebe impracticable to continue any military control over these people unless moreman-power can be made available.E. B.Foreign Office, 2Srd May, 1946.
