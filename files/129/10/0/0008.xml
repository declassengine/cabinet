B.Foreign Office, 22nd May, 1946.PROCEEDINGS OF THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN MINISTERS.The meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers opened on the 25th april and closed on the 16th May. Its agenda was established as being : (1) considera-tion of the Peace Treaties with Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland;(2) a preliminary examination of German questions (the German questions arenot examined in this document). Three other subjects which were raised at theCouncil meeting were : (3) the Treaty with Austria; (4) the Northern Epirus,and (5) Revision of the Italian A rmistice.The French and American Delegations maintained, as I did, that a date should be set for the Conference of the twenty-one Powers, which, under the moscow decision, should consider the drafts prepared by the Council. Mr. Byrnesand I maintained that this Conference should be convened in the first half ofJuly whether complete agreement was reached by the Council on the five peace treaties or not. M. Molotov, however, refused to allow a conference to be conveneduntil complete agreement had been reached on all fundamental issues. Since itis, in fact, these very issues which are still outstanding, we were obliged to choose between deferring issuing the invitations to the conference until a later date andimpairing Great Power unity by proceeding to call the conference in the face ofRussian opposition. The consequences of this latter course would be serious andI was not prepared at that time to take that step. The Council therefore decidedto recess until the 15th June, when it would meet again to re-examine the Treatydrafts, on which the Deputies would continue work, and then determine whetherthe invitations to the Conference should be issued, and for what date. I wouldlike to point out to my colleagues that there has in effect been no total breakdownbut only a deferment of the major issues, on which I am still hopeful that satisfactory agreement can be reached.General.Iln general, more work has been done on the five Peace Treaties than has beenapparent.   The military subjects of four of the five Peace Treaties have been pratically completed and the various viewpoints of such subjects as the italian colonies and reparation have been brought somewhat nearer agreement.   The13342. [31876] copy No.    3 g
general political subjects of all Treaties have also been more or less finalised,including the preamble of each Treaty, and, with a few exceptions, the frontiersand clauses laying down the preservation of human rights, &amp;c. On the otherhand, little progress has been made with the economic clauses of the five Treaties.Peace Treaty with Italy.The principal questions on the Peace Treaty with Italy are the following :-(1) I talo-Yugoslav Frontier and Trieste.In accordance with the decision of the Council in September, a commission was despatched to Venezia Giulia to examine the situation on the spot. On thewhole this Commission agreed on the determination of fact, but on the inter-pretation of the Council&apos;s decision to establish a frontier between Italy and yugoslavia which should leave a minimum under alien rule, there was a fundamental difference of opinion. The line proposed by the Russian Delegationignored this decision and wTould award to Yugoslavia the whole of the Yugoslavclaims, leaving within Yugoslav territory about 600,000 Italians and withinItaly no Yugoslavs whatever. The Russians have maintained that the. City of trieste is the head of the Venezia Giulian body and that both head and bodycannot be separated, but should both be awarded to Yugoslavia. The Frenchline approximated most closely to a frontier which would leave a minimumnumber of Italians under Yugoslav rule and Yugoslavs under Italian rule. TheBritish line awarded a larger area to Italy, including Pola, and in effect would leave the minimum total under alien rule, though it would leave rather moreYugoslavs under Italian rule than Italians under Yugoslav rule. The Americanline differed from the British in leaving to Italy certain economic resources, suchas the Arsa coal mines, thereby recognising that there were certain economic factors to be taken into consideration as well as ethnic, but as a result this leftsubstantially more Yugoslavs under Italian rule than Italians under Yugoslavrule. In general, the French, British and American lines were similar in thatthey attempted to draw a frontier approximating to the clear ethnic division between Italians and Yugoslavs in the area north of Trieste, but in Istria itselfthey varied in accordance with the consideration given to economic factors.Under each of these three proposed frontiers, Trieste, which was recognised byall four Delegations as being predominantly Italian, would be left under Italiansovereignty. It is also notable that the French, American and British lines would, north of Gorizia, follow a frontier which would take into accountgeographic considerations, whereas the Russian line ignores them.The French Delegation were expected in Paris to propose a compromise solution by which the area of Trieste, which is in fact the fundamental issue inthis frontier problem, would be internationalised. This proposal was not made,but the British Delegation have been giving considerable thought to itspossibilities. Should it be necessary for the Council to consider such a coni-promise, it would be essential that the State so established should be trulyinternational and that no Power, either Italy or Yugoslavia or any of the states in the hinterland, should play in it a predominant part.The Council in September decided as a separate question from the limitationof the future Italo-Yugoslav frontier that the Port of Trieste should be inter-nationalised. A special Committee was set up by the Council&apos;s Deputies toexamine this question, but no progress has been made because the soviet delegation are not prepared to discuss even the technical arrangements of suchan international port regime until the sovereignty over the city is determined.The purpose of the United Kingdom Delegation is to establish a port regimewhich would be truly international and in which no State would play apredominant part, much less exercise the power of veto.The Deputies will continue the examination of this question.(2) Zara, the Dalmatian Islands and Pelagosa.The Council agreed that Zara, the Dalmatian Islands and Pelagosa shouldbe ceded to Yugoslavia and a clause to this effect has been finalised. Pelagosawould remain demilitarised and the rights of Italian fishermen will be preserved.(3) Albania.Clauses regulating the independent status of Albania and annulling certainformer Italian rights in this territory have been finalised.
(4) The Dodecanese.Although the Soviet Delegation have agreed in principle that these Islandsshould be ceded to Greece, they have made their acceptance of this provisionconditional on agreement on other territorial questions, especially that of theItalian Colonies. This would seem to be part of a bargain which they areattempting to strike over the whole of the Italian Treaty. The other twoDelegations have agreed to the cession of these Islands to Greece.(5) Austro-Italian Frontier.The Council decided that the Austrian claims to the whole of the province of Bolzano could not be considered as a &quot;minor rectification&quot; in conformitywith the Council&apos;s decision of September. The Austrian Government was informed to this effect and has replied claiming the area of Brunico, the cession of which to Austria would afford lateral communication between the Austrianprovinces of the North and East Tyrol. The Deputies are inviting the Austriansand Italians to state their case on this Austrian claim to them on Thursday, the30th May.(6) Franco-Italian Frontier.The Council agreed that three of the four rectifications requested by theFrench Delegation should be accepted. These were minor rectifications trans-ferring little or no population. The fourth rectification (Tenda-Briga) claimed by the French Delegation was examined on the spot by a commission despatchedduring the recent session of the Council. The Commission reported that thesentiments and language of the population and geographical considerationsoperated neither in favour of the French nor the Italians, but they recommendedthat, whether the territory should be awarded to France or to Italy, suitable arrangements for the water-power of the area should be made so that Italy shouldnot be deprived of the sources on which she at present relies. It is my belief that provision for such economic arrangements should be made in the Treaty, but i hope that the French and Italian Governments may also come together to negotiatesuch arrangements between themselves.The Deputies are to hear the Italian case on Monday, the 27th May.(7) Ethiopia.Clauses regulating the sovereignty of Ethiopia and former Italian rights inthis territory have been finalised.(8) Italian Colonies.Whereas before the meetings of the Council each Delegation had a funda-mentally different approach to this problem, there are now, broadly speaking, two major approaches to it :- &apos;(i) the American plan to place all the Italian Colonies under oollectivetrusteeship by which the administration would be exercised by the trusteeship Council in the name of the United Nations and, so faras possible, Great Power politics would be eliminated;(ii) the French proposal that the Italian Colonies should be restoredindefinitely to Italy under United Nations trusteeship.I made a proposal that Libya should be provisionally recognised as independent under the same form of administration as was enjoyed by the class Amandates after the war of 1914-18, and that the problems of Eritrea and italian somaliland should be examined more closely, i.e., by commissions, particularly inrespect of the claims made by the Emperor of Ethiopia and of the needs of theinhabitants of the territories. My proposal, therefore, as regards Libya, was a variation of the American plan and, in respect of the East African territories,a fulfilment of the principle accepted by the American plan that the needs ofthe inhabitants should be the primary consideration. At one point during theConference, the other three Delegations came near to agreement that the colonies should be restored to Italy under trusteeship and I was prepared to accept therestoration of Tripolitania to Italy under United Nations trusteeship, providedthat Cyrenaica should be placed under United Kingdom trusteeship. I have made it plain on repeated occasions that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to abidefaithfully by the pledges given !to the Senussi tribes of Cyrenaica, not to restorethem to Italian ^domination. It is important to note that the Russians have withdrawn their claim to Tripolitania,&apos;The examination of this -question has been referred to the Deputies.[31876j B 2
(9) Other Political Subjects.Agreement was reached on the necessary, though less important, subjects of: Italian rights in former Turkish territories in the Red Sea, special interestsof China, the Congo Basin Treaties, and Mandates. The desire of the French,American and British Delegations to establish some screening authority tofacilitate the apprehension and trial of war criminals was strongly resisted bythe Russian Delegation and this question is still under discussion, not only inthe Italian but also the Balkan and Finnish Treaties.(10) Limitation of Fortifications.Agreement has been reached on the demilitarisation of Pantellaria andPelagosa as mentioned above and on limitation of fortifications in Sardinia andSicily. The question of the demilitarisation of the Franco-Italian and Italo-Yugoslav frontiers is still under discussion. I am anxious to avoid acceptanceof any radical demilitarisation of the former lest we expose North-East italy to a Yugoslav cowp de main in the event of Trieste being awarded to Italy.(11) Italian Fleet.The Council reached agreement on the size by categories of the futureItalian Fleet and discussion is still proceeding on the units to be left to Italyand on the allocation of the surplus to Russia, the United States of America,United Kingdom, France, Greece and Yugoslavia. The principal outstanding-issues here are the allocation of the two 15-inch battleships, either of whichI am unwilling to see-awarded to Russia; and the French assertion that their claim to certain specific units should be recognised in toto. I am confident that agreement can be reached on this question. I supported very strongly the Greekclaim to one Italian cruiser, and the Council accepted this in principle, thoughthe Soviet Delegation are now holding out against it during the present divisionof the Fleet.(12) Italian Army and Air Force.The Army and Carabinieri are to be limited to a total of 250,000 and Italy is to be limited to 200 medium and heavy tanks. The Air Force will not exceed200 combat type and 150 unarmed aircraft.(13) Other Military Subjects.Agreement has also been reached on certain special weapons (e.g., rockets)which are to be prohibited, on the control of war material, and on the exclusion of the possibility of Italy assisting Germany to rearm. On the other hand, thequestion of any control machinery to enforce the military clauses, the existenceof which was decided upon by the Council in September, is still outstanding,since the Russians refuse to stand by this decision, in order to avoid anyprecedent for possible Anglo-American interference in the Balkans.(14) Existing Bilateral Treaties.I am anxious to include in not only the Italian Treaty, but in the treaties with the Balkan Satellites and with Finland, a provision that each Allied andAssociated Power should be able to notify the ex-enemy State of the Treatieswhich it desires to keep in force. This provision would, in my opinion, preserve the rights of such small States as might not be in a position to negotiate new agreements immediately, and it would prevent the ex-enemy State from auto-matically renouncing such agreements as are essential to international inter-course. No agreement has been reached on this question, since M. Molotov hasrefused to go further than to accept the provision, if it is subject to a veto onany such Treaties by any of the members of the Council, e.g., Treaty betweenAustralia and Italy(15) Ecorvpmic &apos;and Financial Clauses.Since our requirements in all the five Peace Treaties are of a similar nature,I believe it would be most convenient to consider these clauses in their relationnot only to Italy, but also to the Balkans and Finland.I consider that the principal economic and financial questions which have arisen out of the war ought to be settled in the Treaties of Peace. These includesuch matters as reparation, the restitution of looted property, the restorationof the property, rights and interests of the United Nations in enemy countries;
the regulation of contracts; the renunciation by enemy countries of claims whichthey may maintain against Allied countries in respect of action taken by thelatter during the war; the provisions which should govern commercial relationsbetween enemy and Allied States in the period immediately after the signature of the Treaties and other matters. I think that if we settle these matters in clear and precise language, and on a comprehensive multilateral basis, we shallhave contributed materially to the general settlement. I believe that the UnitedStates Government and the French Government share this view and that these governments, together with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,realise that in this, as in other, fields it is their duty to safeguard the interestsof other Governments not represented on the Council of Foreign Ministers. these important but difficult questions have been explored in Paris on three Committees:the Committee on the Italian Reparation Settlement; and the Committees on theeconomic and financial clauses to be included in the Treaties with Italy andwith Bulgaria, Hungary, Roumania and Finland. I fear that no great progress has been made, since it seems to be the wish of our Soviet friends to reducethese provisions to a minimum often, so it seems to me, a rather vaguelyworded minimum and to leave the working solution for bilateral settlement between the enemy Government and the United Nations Government concerned.We shall not relax our endeavours to obtain in the Treaties a clear, comprehensive and practical solution of the principal questions; but I think it is going to beuphill work, especially in the Treaties with Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary.There are thus three major questions on which the negotiation of the ItalianTreaty depends :-(1) Future of the Italian Colonies;(2) Determination of Italo-Yugoslav frontier and the future of Trieste;(3) The payment of Reparation to the Soviet Union.Peace Treaties with Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary.The principal issues in the Balkan Treaties are the following : (16) Frontiers.Agreement has been reached on the frontiers of the Balkan Satellites, briefly,as follows : (a) Transylvania is to be returned in toto to Roumania and the Viennaawards annulled.(&amp;) The frontier between Roumania and the Soviet Union will be recognised as that of the Soviet-Roumanian Agreement of 1940, subject to theSoviet Delegation illustrating the present line on a map.(c) The Bulgar-Roumanian frontier will be that established in 1940 by whichpart of the Dobruja was awarded to Bulgaria.(d) The Greco-Bulgarian frontier will remain as before the war, subject to consideration at the Peace Conference of the Greek and Bulgarianclaims.(e) The frontiers of Hungary will remain as before the war, subject to consideration of the claims which may be made at the Peace Con-ference by Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.With the above exceptions, the frontiers of the Balkan Satellites will beas before the war.(17) The Danube.It is my purpose to ensure that the Danube would be open for navigationby all Powers and I wish, therefore, to restore in some form the arrangements which existed before the war. I have pressed for the inclusion in the BalkanSatellite Treaties of a provision that a conference will be held on a certain dateafter the coming into force of the Treaty and that the Balkan Satellites willsubscribe to the arrangements that such a conference would make. Mr. Byrnesis anxious also that the principle of freedom of navigation and trade on the danube should be established in the Treaties and to this I have been giving mysupport. M. Molotov has been unwilling to accept the inclusion of such provisions and no decision has been reached. The question of the Danube may ultimately be settled as part of the whole question of the waterways of Europe.
(18) General Political Clauses.As in the case of Italy, no serious difficulty has been encountered and suchnecessary provisions as that preserving human rights have been agreed by theCouncil.(19) Withdrawal of Allied Forces.The Council has agreed to include in the Treaties with Roumania and hungary a provision that the Allied Forces would be withdrawn from those two territories with the exception of such forces as may be required for the main-tenance of the Red Army&apos;s lines of communication with Austria.The Council took the decision in September that all Allied Forces should be withdrawn from Bulgaria. But M. Molotov has been unwilling to abide by thisdecision and has attempted to bargain the withdrawal from Bulgaria againstthe Anglo-American withdrawal from Italy. Mr. Byrnes and I have maintained that the Council should abide by the September decision and that the questionof Italy is separate, although I have stated my willingness to examine whetherthe British lines of communication with Austria might not, with Americanconcurrence, be maintained through Germany. In my contention any parallelthat may exist lies between Italy and Roumania.Mr. Byrnes and I have contended at the Conference that, if it were possibleto conclude a Treaty with Austria, all Allied Forces might be withdrawn fromthe Occupied Zones and that, therefore, no lines of communication through eitherItaly or the Balkan Satellites would need to be maintained.(20) Military Subjects.As in the case of the Italian Treaty, these are near settlement. agreement has been reached by the Council&apos;s experts on a Roumanian Army to consist of120,000 men and on a Roumanian Air Force of 150 aircraft, of which 100 willbe combat types.  The Roumanian. Navy will be limited to 15,000 tons.The Bulgarian, Hungarian and Finnish Armed Forces are still underdiscussion and agreement should be reached at an early date on levels, whichshould be about one-half or two-thirds of the Roumanian figures.The Soviet experts have also agreed to similar limitations on the war material of the Balkan Satellites as has been mentioned above in the case of Italy, and,similarly, the question of an Allied Inspectorate is also outstanding.(21) Economic and Financial Clauses.This question, as stated above, is broadly the same as in the case of Italy.Peace Treaty with Finland.The principal issues in the Treaty of Peace with Finland are thefollowing : (22) The A aland Islands.A formula has now been agreed by my Deputy and the Soviet Deputy whichshould assure our requirements, i.e., demilitarisation and preservation of therights of the inhabitants.(23) Frontiers of Finland.The Council has agreed to the cession of Petsamo to the Soviet Union, to therestoration of Hango to Finland, and to the lease of the naval base atPorkkala-Udd to the Soviet Union.(24) Military Subjects.These are dealt with above under the Balkan Satellite Treaties.(25) Economic and Financial Clauses.These are dealt with under the Peace Treaty with Italy.Peace Treaty with Austria.Mr. Byrnes made great efforts to secure the Council&apos;s agreement that the deputies should commence work on the drafting of a Treaty with Austria, but
was unable to persuade M. Molotov. At my suggestion, it is understood that theCouncil will reconsider placing this Treaty on its agenda at its meeting on the15th June.Greek Claims on Northern Epirtjs.I suggested at the Conference that the Greek claims on the Northern Epimsshould also be placed on the agenda. I intend to raise this question again at thenext Council meeting.Revision of Italian Armistice.Agreement was reached to revise the Italian Armistice. The new agreement will be presented to the Italian Government by the Supreme Allied Commander,together with Military Agreements providing for the necessary rights and facilities of British and United States forces in Italy.
