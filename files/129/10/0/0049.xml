CSRCOLATEB,[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)  249 COPY NO.2ND JUDY,   19U6CABINETGANADIAN WHBxAT CONTRirOTMemorandum by the Minister of PoodOn 15th May the Canadian. Government announced that theywere prepared- to enter into negotiations on the basis of theirown proposals and the counter proposals contained in w. F.S.(h6) 17th which were approved by the Food SuppliesCommittee on 10th May.    A delegation from the Ministry of Foodleft for Ottawa on 12th June and opened negotiations onlUth June.2.      At the outset the Canadians were disposed to harden their terms (partly because full agreement had not been reachedinside the Canadian camp).    I therefore saw Mr.  Gardinerimmediately after I reached Ottawa on 18th June.3.      -Afiier a long discussion Mr.  Gardiner proposed thefollowing termsA four year contract (1946-7 to 1949-50).160,000,000 bushels in the first year at a fixed pri*e of 0 1.55160,000,000        &quot;          &quot;    &quot;    second    &quot;        &quot;        &quot;          &quot; &quot; 0 1.55140,000,000       &apos;,!         V    &quot;    third     u    at a minimum price of 0 1.25140,000,000        &quot;           &quot;          fourth    &quot;        &quot;             &quot;      &apos;   &quot; &apos;.&apos;    0 1.00Larger quantities would be provided in the first two years inthe event of a good harvests    The prices for the third andfourth year were to be fixed one year in advance of the yearto which they applied.4.      This was a considerable improvement on the proposals withwhich the Canadians had confronted our Delegation.    The fifthyear was dropped.    The flat quantity of 145,000,000 bushels ayear for each of the four years had been scaled off to give uslarger quantities in the first two years when our needs are specially heavy.    The price for the third year had been reduced from 0 1.55 a bushel to a minimum of 0 1.25.5.      I reported- the new terras to the Chancellor in Amaze 7390,pointing out that on reasonable estimates of market pricessuch a contract might save the Treasury 0 128,000,000.    I was authorised to conclude a contract on these lines,6.       Mr. Gardiner submitted his proposal to the Canadian cabinet and secured approval to it, subject to the U.S. State Departmentbeing informed and raising no objection.      The U.S. State department and the Department of Agriculture had been informed of thenegotiations by the British Food Mission on 17th June.      this had elicited no hostile reaction.

7-      The Canadian External Relations Department had beendoubtful whether an agreement on the lines proposed was inconformity with the proposed international Agreement on commercial policy (Cmd.  6709) and they were sure that Mr.  Claytonwould personally not like it.    They hoped.that the U.S.1A mightpropose some wider plan which,  while stabilising wheat prifc.es,would assure the U.K.   of its requirements without a specificU.K.  - Canadian arrangement.8.      The Canadian approach to the State Department produced the expected opposition but not the desired wider plan.    TheCanadian Government was therefore faced with the alternative of proceeding v/ith the contract or dropping the plan entirely.9-      I discussed the whole  question with Mr; Dean Acheson andMr.   Clayton.    The latter could not have been personally more friendly.    He clearly disliked the proposed contract.    While he admitted that it was not contrary to the letter of the proposedCommercial Agreement he argued that it was Contrary to itsspirit.    This I did not accept,   and pointed out that any agreementwith Canada would contain a clause providing that it would subsumeany wider international agreement to which the two countries might become parties.    He feared that the signature of theAgreement might prejudice the chance of the Loan with congress and added that if the Agreement was raised during the Loan Debatehe would personally be unable to defend it.    In the circumstances reluctantly recommended that signature be postponed untilCongress had taken a decision on the Loan (P.0.   cables from washington A090 and hllh).    This advice was accepted by mycolleagues.10.     I returned to Ottawa on 20th June.    There was considerableconfusion in Canadian circles.    External Relations department was disheartened at receiving no concrete proposal from the U.3.State Department.    Mr.  Gardiner,   the chief protaganist of theAgreement was out west.    Mr.  Mackinnon, who was in charge of thenegotiations, w&amp;s without any definite policy^    The canadian wheat Board,  in Mr.  Gardiner&apos;s absence, had been urgingMr.  Mackinnon to reject the understanding I reached with theformer and return to the staffer original proposals.    I InformedMr.  Mackinnon that in no circumstances was I prepared to re-open the details of that Agreement,  but would examine any entirely new approach which the Canadian Government might make.11.     I saw Mr. Mackenzie King and found him favourably disposed to an agreement on the lines of that which I had negotiated withMr.  Gardiner.    The latter returns to Ottawa this week and will certainly press for an agreement to be concluded on the terms proposed.    I informed- the Canadian Government that the U. K.   couldnot sign the Agreement until Congress had taken a decision on theLoan.12.     I hope that we shall be able to conclude an agreement on thelines of para.  3 of this paper in two or three weeks time.    Thereare certain points of detail and one of substance (the quantityof flour to be taken by the U. K.  under the agreement, within the specified quantities of wheat)  still to be settled, but I do notthink these will present any real difficulties.J. S.Ministry of Food,  S.W.1.2nd July. 1S^&quot;6T
