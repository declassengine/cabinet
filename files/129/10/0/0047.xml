(THIS DOCUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET-O.P. (U-6)   2U7 COPY NO.26TH JUNE, 19k6.CABINETRATIONING .QF. BREAD. AND&apos; OTHER CEREALSMemorandum By Minister of Pood1*      In accordance with the decision reached by the cabinet at their meeting on 27th May (C. M. (h-6) 52nd Conclusions^Minute 5) I have&quot;made all preparations for introducing a rationing scheme after full discussion with the Bakery Trade,the Trades Union Congress and the British EmployersConfederation.     A summary of the scheme is attached at appendix A, and all the necessary documents are beingprinted on this basis..2.      If the scheme has to be introduced, 21st July is formany reasons far and away the best date.      If we are tointroduce the scheme on 21st July I must have the finaldecision of the Cabinet by mid-night Thursday/Friday27th/28th June.    I propose to announce the scheme in answer to a Private Notice question in the House on Friday morning,A draft statement is attached at Appendix B.3.      My predecessor has already Informed my colleagues ofthe many difficulties inseparable from any bread rationing scheme.      I believe that the psychological preparation&apos;ofthe public mind for the scheme has had a useful effect.    Onthe other hand there will, of course, be great unpopularityto be faced over the imposition of bread rationing a year after the end of the war and in face of a largely hostilePress.    Nor can the possibility of a loss of productiveefficiency be ignored.h-      The essential objection to any abandonment of the bread rationing scheme, or even to its postponement, is that I comgive my colleagues no guarantee that in default of rationingsupplies of bread and flour would not run short some time thisAugust,      I need not stress the gravity of the situation whichthe Government would face if bread queues, some of which wouldnot receive a supply of bread, developed at that time,5.      Since my return from Washington I have carefully re-examined the supply position in the light of the latest information inthe possession of my Department here and collected by myself and my officials in Washington and Ottawa.    The position on thefairly long term is, I believe, .improving mainly as a resultof materially better prospects for the Canadian crop -although those prospects will not be firm for another month or six weeks - and the assurance of a good American crop.Unfortunately these better prospects do little to help usget through the.danger point which will occur next August,

/6*      On reasonably optimistic assumptions, including provision by the U. S.A.  of 1P56,000 tons of wheat and receipts from the new home crop arnoitnting to 575,000 tonsby the end of October, &quot;our bulk wheat stock at the endof each month for the period -July/October will be asf ollov1s&apos;000 tons  .tLJuly 592August......... 513September ..... 5901 October ....... 551These stock estimates assume that flourconsumption will continue at the average weekly rate of97,500 tons.  It has in some recent Keeks boon much above this figure and in fact was 110,000 tons in the weekending 15th June.    In this connection the fact must notbe lost sight of that the severe cuts which have had tobe made in rations of animal feeding stuffs, particularly the cut in the domestic pig; and poultry-keepers1 ration,may well lead to a substantial diversion of flour andoatmeal to the feeding of animals unless some form of rationing is adopted.    The wheat stock figures mentioned. above compare with the desired minimum bulk stock levelof 760,000 tons (the equivalent of 7 weeks&apos; flourconsumption)  and recent investigation of the working 8tolevel by my Department gives no justification for thinking that at current consumption rates, a significantly lower level could be operated, except for a very short time,without serious difficulties arising.7.      The scale of rationing proposed in Appendix A will only result in approximately a       saving of flour, but itwill give us control over the situation and will alone, inmy view, moke it possible safely to truer the cornerduring the next &quot;two mcnths of very low  stocks.8,      If it had not been tor this consideration I shouldhave been much tempted to ask my colleagues to postpone thedecision for a few weeks during which we could obtain 0.clearer view of the prospects over the next year,  since it is just possible that they will improve materially;but I feel that the short term risk is not one which i could poseibly ask the Government to take.8.      I am in a position to give the public one piece of goods news, which I think will be unexpected.    This isthat we con increase the meat ration by 2d.  a week.For administrative reasons it is much more convenient thatthe increase should take place on 11th August, but Ishould propose to announce it on Friday, simultaneously with the annoumcement of bread rationing, which will comeinto effect on 21st July,,

9fi; &quot;39*      It has been very strongly represented to me by myDepartment that the whole success or failure of the bread rationing scheme, which is a most complex administrativeundertaking, may depend on adequate explanatory advertising:in the Press.    As -my  colleagues know, there is acutecompetition for the small space available to Governmentadvertisements in the Press at the present moment.    I would ask my colleagues whether they would give directions tothe Central Office of Information to give a very high priority to Ministry of Pood advertisements explaining the bread rationing scheme in the Sunday -papers for the four weeks, 30th June, 7th duly, lb-th July arid 21st July.    Thiswould undoubtedly affect prejudicially other Governmentcampaigns for that limited period, but the consequences of any breakdown in the bread rationing scheme owing to public failure to understand it would be so grave that I feelthat I must make this request for priority.10.    I therefore recommend -(i)    that bread rationing on the  scales proposed at Appendix A should be introduced on21st July next;(ii)    that the meat ration should be increased by 2d*  o.week on 11th August;(iii)    that both, these changes should be announced by me in answer to a Private Notice question on Friday morning;(iv)    that a high degree of priority should be givento Ministry of Pood explanatory advertisementsrelating to the bread rationing scheme in the sunday papers of 30th June, 7th July, lath july and 21st July.Jo S.Ministry of Pood,   U.26TH JUNE, 191+6;

4,      laterchangeability with ordinary pointsBroad coupons will be exchangeable at the food office withordinary points  coup one either way at the rate of 2 points- one small (14 oz, ) loaf.      This is to enable those whosebread needs are much above average to get more bysurrendering entitlement to other foods and those who needlittle bread to keep off flour consumption and receive compensation.      It   provides just that elasticity which is needed to avoid serious hardship.5.      Printing and distribution of documentsThis will have been completed within the next few days.6.      Classification of manual workers the Ministry of Labour  and National Service and theT.U.C.   and B.D.C.  have given much help in preparing lists of &quot;manua1 wor ke r s&quot;.

To secureapproximate flour equivalence the ration will be measuredin Bread Units - one 1 lb.  12 oz.   loaf will be h breadunits, 1 lb.  of flour 3 bread units,  and 1 lb.  of flourconfectionery 2 bread units.Except in the  cases of adolescents of 11 to 18,and of manual workers the necessary coupons are already inthe ration book namely L M G J and P.      The adolescent group will obtain additional coupons from a food, office whilemanual workers will apply through their employers or, ifthey are  self-employed,   through the local office of theMinistry of Labour and National Service.Allowances to catering establishments and institutions will be similarly restricted but I am makingspecial provision to safeguard the adequacy of the &quot;meal-on-the  job&apos;&apos; which is already a feature of the rationing system,particularly for workers engaged in very heavy manual work.I am also making special provision for those workers whohave no access to canteens and who now enjoy the specialcheese ration.      They will be able to secure cou.pons foran additional 6 bread units per week to assist them in providing packed meals from home,answer the Government has decided to introduce as from21st July,  1946, a scheme of bread and flour rationing.I need scarcely emphasise to the House that the Governmenthas only reached this decision becaa.se they are convincedthat to fail to ration bread and flour at the present time would be &apos; to tabe an unjustifiable risk, with, the basicfoodstuff of the British people.      The Government is determined that every family in this country shall be sure of its share of broad and that that share shall be,  in sofar as humanly possible,,  adequate to the individual needs ofits members.      In present circumstances of grave worldshortage of cereals,  the only way of ensuring this is by awell thought out scheme of bread and flour rationing.The scheme will cover bread,  flour, and flour confectionery.Measured in terms of ounces of bread per day,  the rationsfor different groups will be as follows:-

Special authorisations, e.g. for the benefit ofagricultural workers at harvest -time will be granted, forbread as for other rationed&apos;foods.We do not-consider that even these careful gradingsas between different consumers will sufficiently meet the wide variations in individual and family needs for bread.A special feature of the bread rationing scheme will therefore be that the bread unit coupons will beinterchangeable at- the food office with ordinary points.The rate of exchange will be at the rate of one bread unitfor one point, but for administrative convenience the food,offices will only make the exchanges in multiples of 8 atany time during each four week period.      In other words youwill not be able to change less than 8 bread units into8 points.      This -provision will have two effects.      Onthe one hand it will offer an inducement to familieswhich use less bread and flour than their ration to abstain from drawing their full ration and. so obtain some extra points on which they can draw other foodstuffs.On the other hand it will enable any * family which findsthat it needs more than Its broad ration to supplementthat ration by sacrificing some of the family&apos;s supplyof points.I do not for one moment under-estimate the gravity of this step, which conditions of world, famine or nearfamine in many la/ads have compelled us to take,but the Government would be unworthy to hold office if itflinched from this measure and. so id. shed a breakdown in  the bread supply of the people,I have  one good piece of news to give the House.Our meat supply enables me to announce that the meat ration will be increased by.2d.  a week,  from l/2.d.   to1/hd. ,  as from 11th August next.      The increase will bein carcase meat,  so that the ration will then be 1/2d.of carcase meat  and 2d.  worth of canned meat.      Inaddition we  shall increase again from 1.1th Augustmeat supplies for manufacturing purposes, mainly sausages,by about&quot; 20yi.
