I was also asked for a study of the implications ofthe positive proposals in paragraphs 12 - 22 of telegramIndex 61 (CP. (46) 217).     I understand that the Chiefsof Staff are urgently making a military appreciation,with which my military advisers (with such politicaladvice from within the India Office as is required) are ,being associated.     As regards the purely political,economic and constitutional aspects, there is littlethat I can add either to the Delegations own appreciationset out in paragraphs 6-11 of their Statement of 15thMay and, more summarily, in paragraph 21 of theirtelegram Index 61 - or to the Cabinet&apos;s comments containedin telegram Cabin 22,3.     In respect of the Northern Provinces, the planenvisaged in paragraphs 12 - 22 would have all the disadvantages attaching to the Muslim League&apos;s originalproject of Pakistan, with the added, embarrassment forHis Majesty&apos;s Government that they would be inextricablyinvolved in responsibility for maintaining the two widelyseparated Moslem blocks of territory (both of which are&apos;ex hypothesi rion^viable militarily or economically) , inthe face, probably, of a,determined effort on the part ofHindustan to prevent it.     In particular, there would besufficient elements in the northern areas, sympathetic to Hindustan, to form very formidable &quot;fifth columns&quot;operating against the authority of the Government set upin those areas,&quot;and the suppression of these subversive activities would fall, ultimately, upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and its available forces.&apos;4.     In the circumstances predicated, it is not by any

a Office,2th June, 1946.A.H.raeans certain, as Lord, v/avell has indicated in hisappreciation on which Index 61 is a commentary, how theIndian States (or their Rulers) on the fringes of theNorthern areas, would align themselves - whether withHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s authority in the North, or with Hindustan.     His Majesty5s Government might find themselves under an obligation to support certain Rulersand a proportion of their subjects in resistance toHindustan and to domestic disaffection fomented byHindustan,5,     As regards Hindustan, which ex -hypothesi would beleft to its own devices - it may be claimed for it thatit would, by and large? constitute a &quot;viable&quot; state,   Itwould possess a sufficiency of major ports, Bombay,Cochin (for it may be assumed that Cochin State wouldwillingly be abosrbed), Madras, Vizagapatam and Calcutta.It would command the greater part of industrial resources and coal (but not the Indian sources of oil):   it wouldhave a better balanced proportion of the Indian Armyamong its subjects: and - with one reservation mentionedbelow - it would form a solid block of territory.6.     It would, however, be faced with&quot;two very serious problems.     First - in the present abnormal conditionsof world food, supply, with imports much below requirements and in any case forming only a small proportion of whatis consumed in India, Hindustan would be at the mercy ofthe&quot;Northern areas for the avoidance of famine.7.     Second - though the Hindu States in the Hindustanarea might quickly reach an accommodation with them, the ruling class in Hyderabad, headed by the Nizam, would not readily subordinate itself to the dictates of the Hinduauthorities of Hindustan.     The latter could not allow the Moslem Government of Hyderabad to persist like acanker in its midst in a commanding position:   the Nizamcould, however invoke the treaty obligations of the crown to come to- his aid in resistance to any attempt byHindustan to liquidate his dynastic position and authority- an awkward dilemma for His Majesty5s Government to contemplate.8.     The foregoing are the most obvious defects of theproposal in paragraphs 12 - 22 of Index 61.     There are many others to which attention could be drawn - for example,the dislocation of communications which the resultantdivision of India must.entail;   and. the costliness ofestablishing a customs cordon between the two portions.Instances could be multiplied to show that though Hindustancould perhaps better accommodate itself to the results ofthe division of India, it also would have many formidableproblems to surmount, and many-&apos; disastrous conditions todeal with before it could maintain itself as a fullyviable polity.     We should in fact be neither getting&apos; outof India nor retaining the means of maintaining an effective administration.

OUTLINE OF A SHORT-TERM PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION-_FOR INDIA .1.     The plan set out in this note is, in brief, one forthe establishment by Act of Parliament of a provisionalconstitution of strictly limited validity (which mightbe extended, at the request of Indians) containing initself the power of development to the full stature ofan independent state, (the.immediate short fall from full self-government being restricted to those matters whichwould eventually be regulated by agreement with theUnited Kingdom as a concomitant of the complete transferof power), and comprising an Executive which would be legally responsible to the Indian Electorate (through a sufficiently representative Legislature) instead of toParliament at Westminster.2o     A plan of this order, if accepted as in principlesuitable, might point the way to the &quot;new approach&quot;referred to in paragraph 4(c) of Index 61, as necessaryin the event of an impasse being reached in India overeither the Cabinet Delegations proposals for theconstitution-making machinery, or the interim government or both.     Though the danger of an impasse seems reduced,the plan outlined here - or some of its features - might still prove useful for adoption whether to ease the strainsand stresses that may, as with &apos;new wine in old bottles&quot;,develop, during the considerable period required for theconstitution-making process to take effect, in a&quot;political&quot; Executive set up under the present interimconstitution, with an inadequately representativeLegislature, or to facilitate the transference of functionsfrom the present high-powered Centre to the Provinces,which is a cardinal feature of the Cabinet Delegationsproposals.3,     For it is necessary to remember that historicallythe autonomous. Provinces have obtained their presentauthority &quot;and functions as the result of a processof devolution from the Centre, which has been fixed at its present point by the Act of 193b.     (The States,on the other hand, possess their autonomy, and their positionin respect of residual matters as a matter of inherentright and their position is that they have surrenderedcertain of their autonomous rights only to the CentralGovernment of India, e.-g. in respect of communications,customs, currency etc. by agreement).     Having regard towhat has passed already between the Cabinet Mission andthe principal political parties in British India, it isclear that no Central Government is likely to be acceptable to the Muslim League at any rate (and perhaps to most ofthe States) unless its functions are restricted to theessential minimum of federal subjects i.e. external affairs, defence and communications, and the requisitefinancial powers therefor.     But at the present time, notonly these but a great many other functions statutorilyrepose in the Central Government.     It is not possibleto transfer all these functions from the Centre to theProvinces at a stroke of the pen without a grave risk of

administrative chaos;   but that is the goal to be aimed at.     The plan, now propounded therefore&apos;&quot;starts froma realistic recognition of the present position, and aimsat enabling the Provincial units to withdraw from thecentre to themselves all affairs,. other than theessential federal, minimum, to the extent that, aftermature deliberation, they think proper, and to arrange to shoulder the additional administrative burden entailed,4.     The plan is essentially an amendment of-the present act of 1935 for the purposes:(a) To enable the Provinces (and the States) tobecome federated, for such matters only as are essential ;to maintain the status and authority of India as a singlecompetent State among the United Nations, i.e. for defence, external affairs and their means of execution.(b) To give the resultant all-India Government full self-government in respect of the federal subjects.(c) To give the Provinces&apos; (and leave to the States)the fullest measure of self-government compatible with(a) and. (b),5.     It follows that to meet the general desire of indians to -manage their own affairs without interferencefrom the United Kingdom, the present reservation under&apos;the Federal Chapters of the Act of 1935 to the governor general in his discretion of the control of defence and external affairs must go, and these matters mustbe transferred to Indian control;   but the transference of defence is a complicated matter, and it is proposed,under this plan for a provisional constitution that theGovernor General should have certain overriding powers(as indeed he would under the existing form ofgovernment so long as it has to operate) to keep thefield clear in respect of that and such other matters as eventually will be regulated by agreement betweenthe Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United. Kingdom,     it is a feature of this -plan thatthis regulation by agreement might be effected by theprovisional government proposed, and not have to wait,as under the Cabinet Mission&apos;s scheme, until the final form of Indian constitution has been evolved.Period of operation, and range of Governor-General&apos;s andGovernors&apos; r    rveol powers6o    .The Constitution might be enacted to operate for five years if not superseded earlier by a constitutionagreed among Indians providing for a successiongovernment.     (But it&apos; could be subject to extension ifnecessary for such further period as Indians desire.)The Governor-General and Governors appointed by HisMajesty would be advised by ministers in practically thewhole field of government.     They would need to retain

in addition, to the powers appropriate to constitutionalHeads of Government, power to act in independence&apos; oftheir ministers only for two main purposes: (1) tosafeguard, pending the conclusion of the Treaty between his Majesty&apos;s Government in.the United Kingdom andthe Provisional Federal Government, the position underthe Government of India Act in regard to the mattersproposed to be covered in the Treaty, (2)- to maintainby executive decision between the Centre and the unitsthe relationship envisaged in paragraph 4 above incases where the Federal Courts judicial determinationwas i napp1i cable,Method of setting up the Federation7,   . The Provinces would become federated by the bringing into operation of the relevant part of the act of 1935 as amended by the measure now suggested.   Itwould be left to the States to decide for accession,no minimum number being required.For the reason explained in paragraph 3, federalsubjects, to begin with, would be as in the .presentFederal Legislative List;   but the Provinces and states could demand in the Federal Legislature to contract out of the matters held not to be essential forthe purpose of paragraph 4,     Of this in the last resort&apos; the Governor-General would be the judge.     Neithera State nor a Province could, during the lifetime of theConstitution, secede&quot; from the Federation.Constituent Powers8.   &apos; Besides thus effecting a re-distribution of function,between units and Centre - in itself a feature of theconstitution-making process - the Centre and&quot; Provinceswould be free to enact amendments of certain other,provisions of the Act except those which would bescheduled, as unaraendable (because they comprise mattersreserved to be dealt with by treaty or agreement withHis Majesty&apos;s Government) and those necessary for maintaining the essential features of the provisionalconstitution.Protection of minorities9.     The Constitution would include a Charter of fundamental Rights of all-India validity enforceable bythe Courts.10.     As the purpose is to reduce the Federal Governmentto an Agency Centre for the essential minimum functionsonly, and as it is desired also to remove to the efullest extent possible in a provisional constitution the special powers of the Provincial Governors and the Governor-General, most of which are closely interlocked, it would

be desirable, ideally, for the limited period projected,to alter the provincial constitutions in such a way asto necessitate the formation of coalition governments inwhich the minority communities would have their dueproportion of places and which would send to the central legislature their delegates;   but it is probably too late,and at this stage would be too controversial to press thisfeature on the Indian political parties.It is therefore proposed, faute de mieux, that theCentral Legislature should be established in accordancewith the provisions contained in the Act of 1935 forthe Federal Assembly which, of course, has never yet beenbrought into being.     This will secure that the central legislature is at any rate composed of representativesof the various communities and. interests in each Province.It need not, how ever 9i be beyond its competence for theCentral Assembly, in agreement with the&quot; Provinces, to vary its composition to meet nore modern&quot; conceptionsthan those obtaining ^eleven years ago, e.g. by increasingthe representation of Labour or of women in the variousProvincial quotas,11,   Federal Legislature.    -In accordance with this general conception, the Legislature will consist of asingle Chamber, corresponding in composition to theFederal Assembly of the Government of India Act andconstituted like it by the Units and not by direct popularelection.     The States element would be of the same order as that prescribed in Part II of the First Schedule ofthe Act, with the modification that, as indicated above,no necessary minimum number of acceding States wouldbe prescribed.12.   Powers of the Federal Legislature.     The essentialminimum functions of a Federal Centre are recognised,even by the Muslim League, to be in the sphere of defence;external affairs, and communications, with the powersincidental to those subjects, including the provision ofthe necessary finance.  - As it would be an impracticabletask for Parliament to attempt in the present context tore-distribute, in pursuance of this aim, the functionsat present reposed in the Central Government by theLegislative Lists scheduled to the Act of 1935, it ispoposed to regard this as a task which can be undertakenonly in India, in full consultation between the authorities concerned.     It is proposed therefore that initially theprovisional constitution should be based on the existingLegislative Lists, and that any redistribution of the lists may be left to be effected by legislation in India,on the initiative either of the Centre or the Provinces(but with a bias in favour of the authority of theProvinces)., subject to non-interference with the duedischarge by the Federal Government of its essentialminimum functions as described above.   It is suggestedthat, notwithstanding, the provisional constitution should enable the Centre to take powers to over-ride the

It is suggestedthat, notwithstanding, the provisional constitution should enable the Centre to take powers to over-ride the

authority of the federating units in the face of a graveall-India emergency, such as wide-spread famine.13.     The Federal Executive.     The executive power of theFederation will be vested in the Governor-General,acting in almost all matters, including defence and external affairs, on the advice of Ministers.     The transferof defence and external affairs will be complete, subject only to the retention (see para.5 above) of certain powers in respect thereof by the Governor-General in his discre-tion, pending the conclusion of a treaty and to such extent thereafter (e.g. in respect of British defence personnel) as the treats, may provide,14,     The Federal Ministry.     The plan for the FederalMinistry, is, in effect, an adaptation to Indian conditionsof the salient features of the Swiss Federal Constitution.The suggestion is that the Ministers should be appointed &apos;tythe Governor-General after election by the federal legislature, subject to observance of communal proportionson the basis, say, of 40;u caste Hindus, 40/5 Muslims, and2QS for the other^communities.     Provision would have to bemade for the inclusion in the ministry of one or more re-representatives of the States.     The suggested process of election would be, firstly a primary election by communitiespanel of eight elected by caste Hindus, a similar panel -elected by Moslems, a panel of four elected by the remainingBritish Indian representatives, and a panel elected bythe States representatives of two or tour candidates(according as the Governor-General has decided that oneor two States representatives should be included).     Thenumber of Ministers would be decided, in advance by theGovernor-General;   and the whole Assembly would thenelect from the panels of twentytwo or twentyfour candidatesa ministry of that number in the prescribed communalproportions, the elected States&apos; candidates being includedin the appropriate communal group (or groups) with acorresponding diminution therein of the number of British.Indian candidates.     The elected Ministry will in its turnelect one of its number to be Prime Minister.15.     Ministers will be appointed for the life of thelegislature.     The Governor-General must retain the powerof dismissal;   but in the interests of stability, theMinistry will not ordinarily be required to resign as theresult of an adverse vote in the Legislature.   The lattervail, however, be able to- move a vote of no-confidenceprice a year (otherwise than in the budget session), anduie Ministry will be required to resign if the vote iscarried by a two-thirds majority,. As a corollary of the foregoing, it is necessary at the Ministry, in so far as it is unaffected by an

adverse vote of the Legislature, should have power tosecure essential legislation (including taxation).     Itis not proposed to deny the Legislature the power ofrejecting budget demands;   but it is suggested that,for purposes essential to the conduct of the administra-tion, the Governor-Generalexercising his individualjudgment,, should have power to restore rejected grants or to enact necessary legislation which has been refusedby the Legislature by certifying the grant or the bill as essential to prevent a breakdown of the administrationor to safeguard the welfare of the people.17,     In addition the Governor-General, acting on theadvice of his Minister, should have power to enactby short-term Ordinance legislation required to meetan emergency when the Legislature is not in session.
