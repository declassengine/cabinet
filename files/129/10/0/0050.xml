SECRETCP. (46)   2501 2ND JULY s  1946GIFT POOD PARCELS FOR OVERSEASMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of FoodUp to the present there has been a prohibition on private individuals sending food parcels abroad.    Thisdecision was announced in the House of Commons by my predecessor and defended on the i+th April last by the primeMinister.    I have,  however, been invited by the prime Minister   *to re-open the matter, and the question has been discussed between the Departments concerned.2. I feel that it is very difficult to justify apolicy which completely prevents people here sending parcelsof food to individuals abroad - even if they are closerelatives - when they may wish to do so for reasons of personal attachment or conscience.    It is in effect anassertion by the Government of a right to  stop peopledisposing of their own property as.they think appropriate.This can only be justified  if the effect is harmful to others.3. In working out a scheme,  therefore,  I have deemedit necessary to include certain provisions which would prevent its becoming an abuse;    the main provision is to limit the scheme to rationed foods and thus preventdonors drawing on the supplies of unratioired foodsavailable to the community as a whole,4. The United States authorities have now givenpermission for food parcels to be sent from America to theUnited States Zones of Germany and Austria, and I understandthat the British Zone Command have just agreed to admit tothe British Zone of Germany parcels of food consignedin bulk from U.S.A.    There should, therefore - though there probably will be - bo no criticism from America ofthe policy which I propose.5. I understand that the Secretary of State for theDominions is somewhat apprehensive of reactions in theDominions;    it may be contended that while the Dominionsare making sacrifices on our behalf we should not pass onto the Continent food which they have provided for thehome country.    Such.critic ism can, however, be answeredby the fact that the scheme is to be limited to rationedfood stuffs freely given up by those with the right to draw them..*-o4 ^COPY NO .    ; -&apos;  -CABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

6. I would,  therefore,  like Cabinet authority tointroduce a scheme on the following lines:-(i)  For those countries,  to which there is a postalparcels or packet service,  food parcels shouldbe permit ted to be sent not more often than once a month by any individual in the UnitedKingdom to any individual in the overseas countries,  subject to the following conditions:-(a) The contents to be limited to rationed foodswith a detailed statement of them to beput on the parcel;(b) The weight of each parcel containing food to be limited to not more than 7 lbs.no more than 2 lbs.  to consist of any onecommodity;(c) All parcels to be unsolicited gifts astatement to that effect being put on theparcel by the sender.(ii)  For Germany and Austria,  to which countries thereis at present no parcels or packet post, aseparate scheme would be necessary.    This could&apos;be worked through the &quot;Save Europe Now&quot;Organisation, which is prepared to accept responsibility for receiving parcels, limitedto one a month, from individuals in thiscountry and addressed to individuals, forwardingthem in &quot;bulk to Germany and Austria,  and injectingthem there into the domestic postal systems.7. If this policy is approved in principle, there willbe certain details to settle between the Departmentsconcerned, and  it will also be necessary to determine whatpolicy should be adopted in regard to the despatch offood parcels to members of H. M.Forces serving overseas.The policy would at present contravene the Trading withthe Enemy Act, but this,  I understand,  can easily,beput right by the Board of Trade.(Intld)    J.S ministry, of Pood,  S.W.1.2nd July,  19k;6.
