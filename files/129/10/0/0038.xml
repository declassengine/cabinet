A series of widespreadattacks on road and rail bridges on or near the Palestinefrontiers was mede by armed Jews during the night of 16th/l&apos;&quot;&apos;thJune.      Bridges blown up included the ATleriby Bridge (Jerusalem-Amman Road),  the road bridge north of Metulla (northern frontier),  the road bridges over the Jordan at Jisr BanatYacoub and Jisr Sheikh Hussein and the railway bridge betweenSamakh and SI Hamme (Jordan Valley).      On the night of 17th Junea party of about 30 Jews forced an entry into the Railway Workshop:at Haifa and placed explosives.      Explosions followed and firesbroke out.      Damage was done to machinery.      During the subsequent engagement 7 Jews were killed.      On 18th June a party&quot;of armed Jews entered the Officers&apos; Club, Tel Aviv, held up all officers present and carried off 4 British Army officersand one R.A.F.   officer.      later the same day there was apparently another attempted kidnapping,  when 2 Army officers were shot and wounded by an assailant in the streets of jerusalem.      A third Army officer in Jerusalem is missing and is believed to have been kidnapped.      It is understood thatthe kidnapped officers are being held as hostages in connectionwith a case of two Jews sentenced to death for terroristactivities recently,  the sentence still awaiting confirmation bythe G.O.C.2. In the telegram of which a copy is annexed theHigh Commissioner refers to the situation which has arisen as aresult of these outrages and urges -(l)    that His Majesty&apos;s Government should refuse to conductany further discussions on the subject of the admission of 100,000 Jews into Palestine until thekidnapped officers have been returned and(2)    that he should be authorised to put into effect thefull plan against the Jewish illegal organisations and the Jewish Agency at whatever time he thinksappropriate.

Since then we have hadthe Report of the -Anglo-American Committee and the statementof the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 1st May,when he pointed out til t it would not be possible for theGovernment of Palestine to admit so large a number cfimmigrants as the 100,000 recommended hy the Committee unless and until the illegal&apos;armies in Palestine had teen disbandedand their arms surrenderedt      &quot;As the Report points out,&quot;the Prime Minister continued &quot;private armies constitute a danger to the peace of the world and. ought not to exist.Jews and Arabs in Palestine alike must disarm immediately.The Committee have drawn attention to the failure of the jewish agency to co-operate in dealing with this evil, and haveexpressed the vie?:&apos; that the Agency should at once resume active and responsible co-operation with the Mandatory power.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government regard it as essential that the agency should take a positive part in the suppression of these activities,      They hope that both Jewish and Arab leaderswill give counsels of patience and restraint.&quot;4. In reply to the High Commissioners telegram I have informed him that it is not possible to let him have adefinite answer in time for his conversation with Dr. Weizmannto-day, since it is necessary to consult ray colleagues, whichI undertook to do with the least possible delay.5. As regards  the High Commissioner1s first proposal,I do not think it would be well to interrupt at this stage theofficial discussions which have been taking place during thelast few days between an official British delegation and an american delegation under the leadership of the american ambassador,  limited to examination of the implications of therecommendation regarding admission of 100,000 immigrants interms of transport,- the physical and economic aspects of theirabsorption in Palestine and the financial commitment involved.6. As regards the full plan of action against theJewish illegal organisations and the Jewish Agency,  involvingoccupation of the Agency&apos;s headquarters and the detention of selected leaders of the Hagana and the Agency, I suggest that my colleagues should seriously consider whether, in the absenceof any alternative means of dealing with this situation andsubject to the observations of the Chiefs of Staff,  the HighCommissioner should not be given the authority for which heasks.      In view particularly of the statement by the PrimeMinister on 1st May, from which I have quoted above,  thequestion arises whether,  if action is to be taken against theJews,  it is not necessary at the same time to insist on disarmament of the Arabs,      Subject to agreement by the Chiefsof Staff that this additional commitment may be accepted, i suggest that the High Commissioner should be informed that any announcement of intention to proceed wiht the disbandment ofillegal armies and disarmament should apply to all communitiesalike,  though,  in the absence of Arab organisation corresponding to the Hagana and the Jewish Agency,  the most obvious immediateovert action will be against the Jews.      My colleagues will no doubt agree that,  if the High Commissioner is to be given authority accordingly,  the President of the United States andthe Dominion Governments should at the same time be informed,with an explanation that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard themselves as compelled to take this action urgently in thelight of the recent serious deterioration of the internal &apos;s i that ion,G.H.H.mial Office,  S.W. 1.,19th -Time.   1946,       &apos; 0

ANNEXPROM PALESTINE (General Sir A. Cunningham)TO S.   OF S. . COLONIESP.   19th June,  1946MOST immediate no.  995 Top Secret and PersonalI have reported to you series of outrages whichhave taken place In Palestine over the last few days.These have now culminated today in kidnapping of 4 army officers and one Air Force Officer in Tel Aviv, probablyone Army Officer in Jerusalem who is missing, and anattempt in Jerusalem to kidnap 2 other Army Officers whoescaped, but were both wounded in doing so.      I have,nodoubt that captured officers are to be held as hostagesagainst 2 Jews sentenced to death for terrorist activitiesrecently.      These sentences have not been considered byG.O.C.  for confirmation or otherwise.      Apart from otheroutrages, question of these kidnapped officers raises amost serious problem in respect of the death sentences,  asI feel that by some means or other G, O.C. will eventually be informed that the carrying out of sentences will entail the execution of the officers.      All possible steps arebeing taken to recover the officers, but I cannot ignore the fact that normal police and military measures may well&apos;fail to achieve this result in a community which is eithersympathetic to the perpetrators or frightened of result to themselves should they give any assistance to ust      Ilook on the recovery of these officers as of supreme importance and would urge that in the first place.HisMajesty&apos;s- Government should refuse to conduct any further discussions on the subject of admission of 100,000 Jewsinto Palestine until they have been returned;    and in thesecond place that I should be authorised to put intoeffect full plan against Jewish illegal organisations and Jewish Agency at whatever time I think appropriate.In respect of the latter recommendation I should say that recent conflict in Jewish Agency between the moderates,headed by Weizmann, and&apos;extremists, by Sneh and others,  onthe subject of resumption of terrorism has (a) clearlyresulted in a victory for advocates of terrorism.      Partat least of the outrages were carried out by the Haganawhom we know are definitely controlled by the Agency,We can therefore expect further future incidents, possiblyincreasing in intensity unless drastic action is taken.Moreover any hesitancy in action as result of kidnapping .and shooting at officers will have serious effect on the morale of troops who have already been tried very highly.Though fully conscious of the severe political repercussionsat this time yet I request permission to put into effectfull plan against the Agency and illegal organisations at whatever time I think appropriate.      It may be possible forme to use threat of drastic action to secure improvement inthe situation, but as I am banned from taking full actionmy hands are tied in this respect.      I can assure you that should I see any way of avoiding use of extreme measures I 1and always-7    shall do so.      I have told Weizmann to come and see me at 17,45 hours Palestine time tomorrow 19th June,  inthe hope that I can use him to intervene,      I would be gladtherefore if I could get a reply to this telegram by thattime.
