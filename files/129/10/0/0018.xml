&apos;&amp; V&apos;\^.       &quot;    SIl-2--.!!L-- THS PR0PSRTY 0F HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET - S e.COPY NO. t? &amp;C.P.(d6)  218U.th June,  I9d6.CABINETTHE COST OR TBS BRITISH ZONE IN germany memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer must once more bring before my colleagues some factsregarding the British Zone in Germany.      We are spending on thiszone much more  than we should reasonably be required to pay,  andwe arc getting out of it much less than we are reasonably entitledto receive.      And,  though we are putting so much in and taking so little out, we are told that the inhabitants are nearly  starving,and that,  unless we put more in and take less out,  they will allbecome either Nazis or Communists.2. The latest figures furnished to the Treasury by theControl Office indicate that we shall have to spend, in the calendar year 19h7,  91  millions on imports into Germany -including  59 millions for food and  32 millions for other commodities, chiefly agricultural supplies,  raw materials,  etc.  -plus  10 millions on Civil Administration.      As against this expenditure of  101  millions,  the Control Office hope that,  inthe  same period, we aught receive some  1+9 millions from the proceeds of exports.      But my own advisers do not think this hopewill be realised.      Neither do I.3. So far,  since V.E.  day, we have spent,  on the maintenance and administration of our zone of Germany - in addition to themilitary costs of occupation - about  AO millions.      As against this,  the only offset which we have so far received is  500,000for exports from the Bxdtish hone to other countries,  some 1+00,000 worth of exports to this country,  some  750,000 worth of scrap, which we take over as war booty (our only venture inthis field]) and,  in reparations proper (1.e.  goods receivedwithout payment to the Germans),  an insignificant total - perhaps 100,000 of machine tools.      Our total receipts are,   therefore,less than  2 millions up to date.      The distinction between&quot;reparations&quot; and. goods received by us in payment for imports into  the German Zone, has,  of course, no real meaning so long as our total receipts remain so trivial a fraction of our totalpayments.This sum of less than  2 millions is all I can take credit for,  so far,  in  the Budget - though I find It extraordinarilydifficult to get accurate and consistent answers from the responsible Departments to even the simplest questions on thissubject.d. The Control Commission is now employing 1,053 persons atNorfolk House,  and 22,700 persons in Germany.      Of this lattertotal,  16,0/4.1 are military, who are being gradually fitted outwith bowder hats.      These are very large establishments, for whichI do not think we are getting value.      I should like to prune themconsiderably,  and,  in Germany,  to substitute German for1 british labour to the maximum extent.

5. In addition to all&apos; the above expend!tare, v/e are, atpresent,  also spending at the rate of about  100 millions ayear on the Military Forces of Occupation.      Tov/ards this theGermans contribute nothing, but only provide accommodation and certain local supplies and services free.Thus,  contrary to all reason and to all Germanpractice when they occupied other countries,  it is we,  andnot they,  who are paying practically all the costs of occupying Germany.      We should,  1 think, now consider whether wecould not do this  job more cheaply with less Army and more Air.The more we can reduce our personnel in Germany, without reducingits military&apos;effectiveness,  the better.      And there would besocial gains in having fewer of our young men in contact withthe German population.6. The Potsdam Agreement is not being carried out -except one-sidedly by us to our own great disadvantage.According to Potsdam,  we should be  receiving the exportable surplus of foodstuffs from the Russian and other &quot;Zones, whichwould reduce our dollar expenditure on food imports into ourZone.      We should, also be receiving a share of the proceeds ofother exports from the Russian Zone to countries outsideGermany.      None of this is happening.      But we are dismantling,and preparing for delivery to Russia, - as reparations, and,therefore,  without payment - plant which would be a valuableasset,  if we took it for ourselves,  or even let the Germansgo on using it.      We are also exporting coal from our Zone toother countries,  in quantities which prevent us from restoring the minimum German economy which might mare our Zone moreself-supporting.Financially,  we cannot stand the continuance of theseunjust and lop-sided arrangements,  which were certainly not contemplated when we signed the Potsdam Agreement.7. Nor is this all.      V/e are not even taking advantage ofsuch meagre rights as we still enjoy.      We are entitled to charge for exports from our Zone.      But,  up to date,  Iunderstand that we have presented bills only for about a thirdof what we have exported, and we may still expect delays before we receive payments on those bills.      For the protection ofour finances, I must ask that these delays shall come  to an end and more  business-like methods be  adopted by the control commission and by the other agencies concerned.8. Two things which v/e ought to be getting from germany in great quantities are:-( i ) T imb e r,  an cl(ii) industrial plant,  including machine  tools.g. Our need for timber,- both for housing and for amultitude of other purposes,  is extreme.      We have twicedevastated our own poor little woodlands in wars begun byGermany.      The Germans,  on the other hand,  still have hugeforests, which they have carefully safeguarded,  while they haveruthlessly cut the  forests in occupied countries.      Yet,  to theend of April,  only &quot;,,500 standards have come to us from Germany.This has,   in my view,  been one  of the major failures of our administration in Germany,  for which our. own Timber Controlmust be held largely responsible.      I must press strongly fora much more - efficient and more vigorous organisation of this vital service.

10. The proposal that we should take from our Zone the machine tools and other equipment which we urgently needfor our housing programme,  and to gather in our crops, was putforward some six months ago.      We should, in my view, havetaken swift and immediate action to obtain these deliveries,and afterwards submitted a full account of what we had takento the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency at Brussels.      Insteadof this, there has been one cielay after another.      Eventually,on the proposal of the Foreign Secretary, and with my full support, we decided to take unilateral deliveries;    butobjections were raised by our representatives in Berlin,  andthis Ministerial decision has never been carried out.      A plan for urgent deliveries to all countries entitled to reparationwas next put forward;    but this again has been hung up by onedelay after another,  and nothing has been done.      Meanwhile,the Russians and French have gone   on taking what they needed,and General Clay is seexing authority from Washington to dothe same.      The British,  alone, have shown no inclinationtowards self-help.11. Under the present procedure, I am told that it will takesix years to deliver the capital equipment earmarked for reparations.      This is a monstrous timetable, and v/e mustorder a sharp acceleration.12. The only final solution of our difficulties is, nodoubt,  a satisfactory political settlement of Germany,  inagreement with Russia,  the United States and France.      i recognise,  though with great regret,  that we must continueto spend money on Germany in the financial year 1947/48. &apos;   Butwe should not,  and cannot,  call upon the Britsh taxpayer tocarry the Germans on his back beyond that year.      I must ask that&apos; this target date should now be fixed by the Cabinet,  andthat the Control Office and all other Departments should make their plans accordingly.13. I propose,  therefore -(1) An immediate overhaul of the numbers of the army of Occupation and of the Control Commission.(2) A.speeding up of(a) billing and collecting payments for exports;(b) the delivery of timber&apos;to the United Kingdom;(c) unilateral deliveries of industrial plant andequipment;(d) reparations procedure as a whole.(3) The issue of an instruction to the control commission to plan their policies for our Zoneon the basis that all payments from the exchequer in aid of the Zone will cease at the end of thefinancial year 1947/48.H.D.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.,4th June, 1946,
