THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 235.18th June, 1946.CABINET.BASIC ENGLISH.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WE have to decide whether we should continue to give official support tothe encouragement of Basic English either (a) as an auxiliary internationallanguage or (b) as a means of teaching English, or both.Mr. Winston Churchill on the 9th March, 1944, decided, after the question had been referred to a Ministerial Committee, to adopt (a) but to reject (b).Methods of giving effect to his decision have since been studied by an Inter-departmental Committee. It was found difficult during the war to negotiate with the inventor, Mr. C. K. Ogden, and to devise suitable administrative machinery.   Little effective work has in consequence been done.Basic English as an international language has the merit of being derivedfrom and part of a living language. Its successful adoption would kill Esperantoand other freak languages. As a method of teaching English it is of courseonly one amongst nmny others. A summary of the pros and cons of Basic Englishis attached.The original decision to encourage Basic English as an internationallanguage was made by the Cabinet and announced.! by the then Prime minister in the House of Commons and in a White Paper. The question of continuingthat policy is therefore now submitted to the Cabinet for reconsideration.Either way is open. We can desist from further negotiations with Mr. Ogden,to whom  23,000 was recently paid in order to extinguish certain claims. these were formulated at a figure of  56,370 when it was recently decided to discontinue negotiations which had been proceeding over a long period for setting up a Trust to develop Basic English. In return, and subject to existing commitments, Mr. Ogden has agreed to assign his copyright to the Crown (butnot to the British Council), if so required before the 30th June next. He is nowbeing asked to extend this date. Unless so required, the copyright will be freedfor general use throughout the world. A memorandum explaining these negotiations is also attached.Despite doubts about the merits and prosjoects of Basic English, I am not sure that we ought to drop it and I should like the Cabinet to decide whetheror not to continue to give it official support. The extent and method of that support will then be further considered in the light of that decision.E. B.Foreign Office, 18th June, 1946.13383   [31989]
ANNEX 1.Summary of Arguments For and Against Basic English.What Basic English is.The essence of Basic English is the use of a very carefully chosen vocabularyof 850 Basic words in conjunction with the absolute minimum of simple all-purpose verbs such as &quot; have,&quot; &quot; get &quot; and &quot; put.&quot; Thus &quot; I have knowledge &quot;ds used in Basic English instead of the verb &quot; know,&quot; &quot; get rid of &quot; instead of&quot;eliminate,&quot; &quot;put up with&quot; instead of &quot;tolerate.&quot; For special subjects,e.g., in science or economics, an extra vocabulary of up to 150 words may berequired in addition to the basic 850.The A chantages.Among the advantages claimed for Basic English are that it (a) Promotes the use of English as a World Language. The inventor claims that by means of Basic English a wide range of expression is achievedwith a minimum of material, that sound and rapid progress can bemade in learning, and that the limitation of vocabulary compels clearthinking. Basic is therefore a vastly better choice as a world languagethan Esperanto. Ido, Interglossa and other artificial languages, andenjoys the great advantage over them of being founded on a living-language.(b) Provides an adequate foundation for the subsequent acquisition of fullliterary English and is at the same time complete in itself and veryeasy to learn.(c) Provides an efficient means of Communication, particularly among theworkers in all lands who do not need large vocabularies. BasicEnglish should also be useful among backward races of the Empirehitherto divided by dialects, e.g., West Africa, West Indies and theFar East (replacing hundreds of local varieties of pidgin English).In India Basic English should serve as a means of communication between racial groups (particularly in the Indian Army).(d) Aids British Exports. E.g., by enabling advertisements of British goods to be understood when written in Basic. The British standards institution has already undertaken to assist and is ready to print some further British Standard specifications in Basic English. One suchspecification has already been issued.(e) Aids communication of the results of scientific research. Scientificworkers everywhere are at present hampered by ignorance of foreignlanguages. If they used Basic English the records and discoveriesof science would immediately become available for Basic Englishreaders.(f) Would serve as a vehicle for British Foreign Publicity. Basic English,working within a scientifically delimited vocabulary, affords anopportunity to present the British message in a clear and. simplefashion.(g) Is easy &quot; to sell &quot; because it is a distinct product, like a Patent with a trade Mark. It can therefore be the object of specific publicity in away General English cannot. The slogan &quot;Learn Basic English&quot;is likely to be more effective for publicity purposes than the more general slogan &quot;Learn English.&quot; The very numerous attempts topirate Basic English abroad for commercial purposes are evidence ofits attractiveness from this point of view.The Disadvantages.1. The objection has been raised that the deliberate encouragement of basic English is liable to arouse resentment abroad as a form of imperialismintended to assist in making English the dominating world language.2. The limited vocabulary and the elimination of verbs lessen its effective-ness as an approach to normal English, since in passing from Basic to widerEnglish the pupil has to unlearn much that he has already learnt. It is liabletherefore to confuse, and conflict with, the spread of full literary English.
3. The circumlocution necessitated by the limitation of vocabulary andespecially of verbs is cumbrous; it makes for flatness and diffuseness, which arenot likely to be effective either in advertisement or in other forms of publicity.4. i It cannot be assumed, as claimed in (6) above, that the encouragement of Basic English as an artificial growth will enable it to supersede local pidgindialects which are a natural growth.5. It will be very difficult to persuade potential users to spend time and money on learning an international language which may come to nothing andmay, moreover, as stated in. (2) above, impede the acquisition of normal English.6. A learner of Basic may be greatly discouraged to find that people whospeak normal English, while able to understand Basic, will not themselves beable to speak it except in the rarest cases.7. It is suggested that the major difficulties in learning a language, whetherinternational or other, lie not so much in the vocabulary, as in the use and thepronunciation of that vocabulary and in subtleties of idioms and of the use ofprepositions (cf., differences of meaning between &apos;&apos; to put up&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; to put up with&quot;).8. Another objection is that attempts to sell Basic English like a patentedcommodity are likely to arouse prejudice against it as an inferior substitute for the genuine original.9. Basic, and particularly written Basic, may if enough people can be persuaded to learn it be intelligible to a wider international public than normalEnglish. Nevertheless, for advertising and commercial purposes nothing caneffectively, nor therefore should, take the place of the language of the country where the advertisement or catalogue is intended to make its appeal.General Observations.In the absence of careful and prolonged tests on an adequate scale it isdifficult to come to definite conclusions with confidence. Small experimentsconducted in Greece, Africa, Japan, U.S.S.E., Czechoslovakia, China and india are said to have promised good results. In other cases initial progress has notbeen maintained and early enthusiasm has waned in the light of experience.In America it appears that Basic English has achieved some success in variousexperiments, but as a method of learning English rather than as an internationallanguage. It may indeed prove that the distinction drawn in the White Paperbetween Basic English as a means of teaching English and as an internationallanguage cannot be maintained in practice.Owing to the difficulties of pronunciation and of conversation between a speaker of full English and a speaker of Basic the benefits of Basic as an inter-national World language may in practice be limited at any rate for a long timeto come mainly to its written use.ANNEX 2.Outline of Negotiations with Mr. C. K. Ogden for the Promotion of basic English.Mr. Winston Churchill announced in a speech at Harvard University on the6th September, 1943, that a Ministerial Committee had been appointed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to study and report upon Basic English.2. On the 9th March, 1944, Mr. Churchill informed the House of commons that, after receiving the Report of this Committee (which has not been published),His Majesty&apos;s Government, while not prepared to encourage Basic in preference to any other method of teaching the English language, had decided to promote the use of Basic as an auxiliary international and administrative language.Primary responsibility for giving effect to this decision was placed upon theForeign Office acting through the British Council.3. Negotiations were thereupon begun with Mr. C. K. Ogden to acquire the necessary copyright as well as his active co-operation, and the discussion soonled to the proposal that a Basic English Trust should be established as the primaryexecutive agency to give effect to the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
4. It proved extremely difficult in the negotiations, protracted through1944-45, to arrive at a settlement satisfactory to Mr. Ogden. No final agreementwith him had been reached at the conclusion of the war, although a basis forsuch an agreement was ready before the General Election of 1945. When thematter was reviewed after the change of Government it was decided not toproceed with the proposal for a Basic English Trust.5. When this decision was communicated to Mr. Ogden he claimed com-pensation on the grounds that he had suffered loss and damage by the cessation of financial support from certain private Foundations in the United States,by his holding at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government the copyright in basic English which he would otherwise have been able to market upon very favourable terms : by maintaining at considerable expense in the expectation oftheir use by His Majesty&apos;s Government certain facilities, staff and services nowno longer required, by his inability to safeguard and utilise certain stocks ofunbound books which have since deteriorated, and, finally, by his inability to devote his own time and energies to other pursuits throughout the period over which the negotiations have been protracted. His claim consisted of the following-items :   (1) Deterioration in value of the copyright in Basic English      20,000(2) Loss of assets which the Trust should have protected but did not      .............       ......       ...    &quot; 18,000(3) - Expenditure by loans incurred in good faith in expectation of a Government grant and expenses incurred in main-taining the continuity of the Orthological Institute andLibrary     ...................,      ...      12,370(4) Inability owing to the uncertainty and protracted natureof the negotiations to create new assets such as the&quot; Science Dictionary&quot;   ...      ...      ...       ...       ...        1,000(5) Compensation for the personal losses suffered by Mr. Ogden&apos;through his intellectual and administrative immobilisa-tion for 2-i years awaiting a decision ...      ...       ...        5,00056,370Fie stated that he would be ready and anxious to submit to arbitration hisresultant claim for compensation amounting to  56,370, but that in the interestsof a quick decision he would accept in full settlement the sum of  23,000. Thisis the amount it had been proposed to pay him upon the creation of a BasicEnglish Trust, principally in order to secure certain essential copyrights. Forthis payment Mr. Ogden declared that he would also free the copyright in BasicEnglish for world-wide use after existing agreements in certain territories expire.6. Mr. Ogden&apos;s claim has been carefully studied and he has been examined in detail upon it at meetings in the Treasury Solicitor&apos;s Office. Disallowingsome considerable amounts it has been decided that  23,000 would in thecircumstances be a justifiable award and this sum has therefore been paid toMr. Ogden.7. A condition of the payment was that Mr. Ogden would, if so required before the 30th June, 1946, assign his copyright in. the Basic English StandardisedWord List and System to the Crown, subject to existing commitments.The purpose of this reservation was to leave open the question whether itis desirable to try to promote Basic English by official means until the matter had been laid before the Cabinet.If the copyright is not required by the Crown, Mr. Ogden has undertaken to free it, subject to existing commitments, for general use throughout the world.
