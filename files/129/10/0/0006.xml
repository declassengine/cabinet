(US)  20621+TH MAY 8  19460AB.IN GT&apos;CALL-UP TO THE FORCES IN  1947 AND  1948Me mo ran darn by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs. At their meeting on 20th May (CM. (4-6) 50th Conclusions,Minute 2)  the Cabinet invited the Man-Power Committee -(i)  to consider what relaxation of the  call-up of apprentices in 1947 might be made;    and(ii)  to prepare for consideration by the Cabinet adraft White Paper setting out the revised schemefor call-up proposed in CP. (46) 194.2.      Deferment of Apprentices.      The scheme for call-up whichthe Cabinet had before them on 20th May made no provisionfor the grant of deferment to apprentices in 1947 butallowed the deferment of -all apprentices from 1st January,1948*      The    Cabinet felt, however,  that some measure of deferment in 1947 was very desirable in the interests of civilian industry.      It seems clear that deferments couldnot be granted to all the 63,000 apprentices who will reach the age for call-up in 1947 unless at the expense of retainin,men already in the Forces for an unreasonably long period;and the Man-Power Committee consider that the right course is to discontinue the grant of deferment on industrialI   grounds and to limit it to those apprentices and others whoseI   employers have entered into a definite obligation to give,j   and are in fact giving,  them a satisfactory course oftraining or who are attending full-time technical classes.The task of deciding whether deferment should be granted inany particular case could be discharged by the District Man-Power Boards, who would be given guidance by the Ministry ofLabour and National Service on what they were to regard asa satisfactory course of training.      The merit of adopting acriterion of this kind is that it would give much neededencouragement to employers to provide proper conditions of apprentiship and training and thus lead to an improvementin  the efficiency of industry.      For this reason theCommittee recommend that the test which they have proposed should be applied not only in 1947 but also in subsequent years.3.      It is impossible to estimate with any precision how many apprentices and learners would qualify for defermentunder the test proposed in paragraph 2, but it is likely toreduce the yield of Scheme D in  1947 by at least 30,000,  andthis number will be substantially increased unless the Man-Power Boards can find some way of applying very stringentrules,  which will have the effect of turning down about 1in 2.      The    Cabinet will recall  that the yield of Scheme Din 1947 already falls short of the numbers estimated to berequired by the Chiefs of Staff in D.0.(46) 44, and it shouldCOPY NO.   .?b

be borne in mind that unless the scheme for the recruitment of regular and short service volunteers is much more successful thanit has hitherto shown any signs of being, the numbers of men available will be reduced still further.      On the other hand,  ithas not yet been possible for the Defence Committee to reach final decisions on the strength of- the Forces in 1947 after taking intoaccount the relief afforded by a larger recruitment to the Women&apos;auxiliary Services and by the other measures proposed at their meeting on 17th May (D.0.(46) 16th Meeting, Minute 1).4.      Training of Men in the Forces.      The Man-Power committee recommend that .the Services should take all possible steps toensure that apprentices who are called up receive further trainingin the trade in which they were engaged before their call-up.      Itwill not always be -possible to provide for this,  since some tradeshave no counterpart in the Services, but by careful selection itshould be possible to go a long way towards providing that thetime spent by a man in the Forces will enhance his value as aworker.5.     Draft White Paper.      Annexed to this memorandum is a proof of a White Paper setting out the arrangements for call-up in 1947and 1948.      The attention of the Cabinet is drama to paragraph 2,which gives a warning that the operation of the scheme will depend -on developments in international affairs,  to paragraph 7, whichannounces the intention to make the bornen&apos;s Auxiliary Services apermanent feature of the Forces,  and to paragraph 9, which dealswith apprentices.     The Cabinet will wish to decide when the white paper should be published.6.     To sum up, the Cabinet are asked -(I) to approve the proposals made in paragraph 9 of the draft white Paper for the deferment of apprentices;(ii) to invite the Service Ministers to make the best possiblearrangements for the continued training in their owntrades of apprentices who are called up before their training is completed;  and(iii)  to approve the draft White Paper annexed to this memorandum and to settle the arrangements for its publication.E.B.gn Office, S.

ANNEXREVISED PROOFCall Up to the Forcesin 1947 and 1948Presented by the Prime Minister to parliament by Command of His majesty may 1946LONDONHIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY office net cmd.
CALL UP TO THE FORCES IN 1947 AND 19481. In February 1946, His Majesty&apos;s Government published a StatementEelating to Defence (Cmd. 6743). In paragraph 13 of that Statement it was stated that as soon as the position could be more closely gauged His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intended to announce that from a given date all new entrants tothe Forces under the National Service Act should be called up for a definite period, and to say what that period would be. It was also stated that itwould then be the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government to demobilise as rapidly as possible though this would necessarily take some time all those in theServices who on the given date would have served for longer than the periodfixed for new entrants. - -2. Many of the factors on which decisions must be based are necessarilystill uncertain. Thus, it is difficult to judge the strength at which it will benecessary to maintain Forces in the next few years in order to fulfil the responsibilities df the United Kingdom for the occupation of Germany,Austria and Japan, for the resettlement of countries disorganised by the warand for the maintenance of international peace and security. These responsi-bilities are described in paragraph 9 of the Statement Eelating to Defence.Moreover, it is not yet possible to estimate with any accuracy the rate of entry of volunteers for the regular Forces or the extent to which the voluntary recruitment of women to the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services will lessen theneeds of the Services for men. Nevertheless, Flis Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave decided that an announcement of the arrangements for the call up ofmen to the Forces in the years 1947 and 1948 should now be made. Theymust, however, make it plain that unforeseen developments may lead to a revision of the estimates on which the arrangements are based. If anysuch revision should prove necessary, it will be their aim to give as muchadvance notice as possible of any changes which may be required to be madein the plans.3. In reaching a decision it has been necessary for Flis Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent to take account of the need for maintaining adequate Forces, for continuing the release of men already in the Forces, and for meeting theman-power requirements of industry. The total man-power available is insufficient to meet all these demands in full and His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave sought to achieve the best possible balance between them.4. After the end of the war in Europe the upper age of call up was reduced to 30. Since then the position of all fit men between 18 and 30not in the Forces has been and is being constantly reviewed. By the end of1946 any such men still in civil life will be in work from which they cannotbe spared if essential production and services are to be maintained. To agreat exent they will be in coalmining, agriculture and the railway service.Accordingly from the 1st January, 1947, call up for the Forces (subject tothe few exceptions dealt with in paragraphs 10 to 12) will be confined to menliable under the National Service Acts who were born in or after 1929 and tothose born in 1927 and 1928..who will be in process of being called up inDecember 1946. Such men&quot; will normally be called up for service on reaching 18 years of age.
5. Men called up during 1947 will serve for a period of two years and,if no unforeseen circumstances arise, the period of service of men called upin 1948 will be as shown in the following table :  Date of entry.Period of fixedservice.1st January, 1948, to 31st January, 19481st February, 1948, to 31st March, 19481st April, 1948, to 31st May, 1948f I    1st June, 1948, to 31st July, 19481 &quot;    1st August, 1948, to 30th September, 19481st October, 1948, to 30th November, 19481st December, 1948, to 31st December, 1948A years.1 year 11 months.1 year 10 months.1 year 9 months.1 year 8 months.1 year 7 months.1 year 6 months.6. Men already serving in the Forces at the 31st December, 1946 (except those serving under voluntary engagements for fixed periods), will be releasedaccording to the existing age and length of service scheme, and all such men will be released before the end of 1948, that is to say, before any of the men called up in 1947. Moreover, it will be the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to release during 1947 all men called up before the 1st January, 1944.7. It has been decided that the W.R.N.S., the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F,will be continued on a voluntary basis as permanent features of the Forcesof the Crown. Recruiting and re-engagement for the Women&apos;s auxiliary services will be actively pursued. A7olunteers will be taken on for a periodof service which will not be less than 2 years. Full details of pay,conditions and terms of service will be issued at an early date.8. In 1947, and later if necessary, call up may be deferred as atpresent on grounds of industrial need in the case of men employed incoalmining, agriculture, building and the production of certain building materials. Apart from these, there will be no deferments on industrialgrounds after the 1st January, 1947. .9. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to encourage efficient schemes of professional and industrial training. &quot;With this aim in view they havedecided that after December 1946 apprentices in the 1929 and later classes,including those of a kind not eligible for deferment on account of apprentice-ship as such in 1946, will be eligible for deferment for the period necessaryto complete their training, provided that the Ministry of Labour and national Service, through the machinery of the District Man-Power Boards,are satisfied that a genuine and satisfactory apprenticeship exists, whichwas begun at the age customary for the occupation, and that a period of deferment is necessary for this purpose. Articled clerks, learners, thoseattending certain full-time technical&apos; classes, and others in a positionsimilar to apprentices will be treated on the same basis as apprentices.&apos; 10. Candidates for the Higher School Certificate and the ScottishSenior Leaving Certificate examinations, or their equivalents, born on or after the 1st October, 1928, will have their call up deferred to enablethem to take the examination in the academic year ending the 31st July inwhich they attain the age of 18, but will be called up in due course.11. Men born before the 1st October, 1927, whose call up is at presentdeferred because they are students, or who are reserved as such, will, on
completion of the normal university course, be called up or retained in civil life as the national interest, may require..) University students born afterthe 1st October, 1927, and admitted - to universities ; before the end of 1946under arrangements approved by the Minister, of Labour and NationalService will remain deferred until the completion of their normal universitycourse and will then be called up. Full details of these arrangements weregiven in the House of Commons by the Minister of Labour and NationalService on the 30th April last.12. Candidates for admission to universities in 1947 and 1948 will be eligible to have their call up&apos; deferred in so far as they can be accepted bythe universities under such&quot; arrangements as may&apos; be approved afterconsultation with the university authorities. Details of the arrangements and of broadly similar arrangements for students at Teachers&apos; training colleges will be announced in due course.london printed AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OFFICETo be purchased directly from H.M.
