THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1949Copy No.CABINETLOCAL government memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.In CP. (49) 82 the Minister of Health proposes the appointment of a RoyalCommission to consider and report on the functions and structure of local govern-ment in England and Wales, including London.2., I think that it will be useful to the Cabinet to have a statement of some-of the arguments which led certain members of the Lord Presidents Committee attheir meeting on 4th March, 1949 (L.P. (49) 5th Meeting, Minute 2) to prefer an inter-departmental (official) committee to a Royal Commission, and why the adop-tion of the Minister of Health&apos;s proposal may prove embarrassing to the&apos;Government.The valuable report on the main peacetimejproblems of local government whichwas prepared by the present Lord Chahcellbr for the Coalition Government in1942 (R.P. (42) 3) is an illustration of what can be achieved by means of an intern-departmental inquiry.3. Those of us who took this view were doubtful about the proposal for a royal Commission on two main grounds : (a) The actual composition of the Royal Commission would produce an awkward dilemma. If representative people from local governmentwere appointed, they would tend to look after the interests of theirown class of local authority. If the Commission consisted of indepen-dent people not drawn from local government, they would have theadvantage of being free from prejudice, but would find it difficult to, make up their minds in view of their lack of local governmentexperience and the conflicting evidence which they would receive fromthe local authorities. In either event, the probability of a coherentreport would be slight, and it would be more than likely that we shouldhave either a report which was an unsatisfactory compromise or aseries of minority reports. The Minister of Health argues that evenif this happened the Government would be better off because &quot; thefacts of the position, and the inability both of local government andof the Commission to agree on the action to be taken, would havebeen fully exposed.&quot; With all respect to him, I am not sure we need-a royal Commission to expose the essential facts, nor does it need a RoyalCommission to expose the lack of agreement among local authorities..(b) A Royal Commission would waste valuable time.  We can easily resistlegislation in the present Parliament, but, as the Minister of Healthrecognises, it will not be easy to do so in the next, and it is difficult. to carry through a radical scheme of local, government reform late in any Parliament.  The Conservatives discovered this in 1929.4.   If we set up a Royal Commission, how would the time-table look?   Itwould not be simple to settle its composition, and it is doubtful whether it couldbe set up until the summer or start its work effectively until &quot;after the holidays.The local authorities and their associations would have to be given time to pre--   pare their evidence, and this would be a.complicated business which would take36976SECRETCP.

several months to complete. The Commission would have to receive and digesta great mass of evidence, then draft and submit its report, and it is doubtfulwhether it would be reasonable to expect the report to be published by the endof 1950 as the Minister suggests. Allowing, however, that the report would beavailable then, when on a realistic view could we expect the necessary legislation,to come into effect ? Several months would have to be allowed for local authorityreactions to be collected and for the Government to decide upon its policy. If therewere conflicting reports, or a report which was thought to be unsatisfactory, theGovernment would have to start virtually afresh in framing its own scheme. Thenext step would be to prepare legislation and to carry it through, but even this would not be the end of the story, because presumably the Bill would fix anappointed day in the future for its provisions to come ito effect, and there mightwell have to be boundary reviews. In the case of the Local Government act of 1929 which became law on 27th March, 1929, the appointed day was 1st April,1930.In these circumstances, I find it hard to see how on an optimistic view theappointed day could be earlier than 1953, and it might very well be 1954. Thatwould be too near the end of the next Parliament to make the legislationpolitically desirable from the point of view of either political party, for wemust remember that this is a matter which cuts across party lines.5. What is the alternative? It is to face the fact that this difficult and important problem will not be solved until some Government is preparedprovisionally to make up its own mind in the face of the conflicting views of thelocal authorities and then, after fully consulting the local authorities, to come forward with a scheme which it is ready to recommend to the country early inthe new Parliament. In view of the substantial knowledge and experience oflocal government possessed by members of the present Government it is particu-larly well fitted to prepare such a scheme. We know all we need to know aboutthe attitude of the different classes of local authority, and the relevant facts are already in the possession of the various Departments concerned &quot;with localgovernment. We also have the advantage of the 1947 Report of the Local Govern-ment Boundary Commission, and we should not forget that rightly, as I think-the Minister of Health agreed that the Commission should make recommendations on the reorganisation of local government generally because he thought that itwould be valuable for the issue to be publicly ventilated^ The discussion whichhas taken place on the Report has been by no means unfriendly; it has helped to clarify the main issues; and, whether or not we endorse the recommendations,I imagine that we would all agree that the Commission has done a usefulservice in putting forward a scheme which is worthy of serious consideration.6. I do not deny that there are points on the other side. The chief onesare perhaps that we may lose time if we find ourselves unable to make up ourown minds and have to set up a Royal Commission after all; andthat local authorities might resent the Government taking the^ initiative in formulating proposals for &apos; local government reform. Some peopleargue that on the whole the present system is not working too badly, and thatthere is no real hurry. It will be for the Cabinet to weigh the arguments on both sides, but, speaking for myself, while I remain open to persuasion, I donot feel easy about embarking on a Royal Commission until we have at lease con-sidered further the kind of reforms we would ultimately like- to see adopted.This may have a bearing on the terms of reference, and a Royal commission might not unnaturally expect to have some indication of the Governmenfs ownpreliminary views, both in general and particularly as far as the relations between government Departments and the local authorities are concerned. I am very muchafraid, too, that we may be told that once again we have taken the course favoured by Governments which shirk difficult decisions and be criticised for falling backon the delaying device of setting up a Royal Commission. If we take the viewthat it is of no great account whether there is legislation in the next Parliament,we might as well give up a little time now to thinking out more precisely what we would like to achieve.H. M.11, Downing Street, London, S.W. 1,-    m May, 1949.
