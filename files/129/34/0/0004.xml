HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)secret . P. (k10) 1U28TH MARCH. 19h9CABINETSALE OF H.M.S.   &apos;AJAX&apos; TO CHILE   -Memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyAt their meeting on 21st March (C. M. (i+9) 21stConclusions, Minute h) the Cabinet considered my memorandumOsP. (i+9) 65 on the above question and agreed that an offer ofthe sale of H. M. S.   1 Orion&apos;, in the place of H. M. S.   &apos;Ajaxf,should be made to the Chilean Government.2. It was not then appreciated that H. M. S.   &apos;Orion&apos;,allocated,for ship target trials, had suffered her firstattack underwater (with resultant flooding damage), but i fear that this rules her out from consideration as apossible alternative to H. M, S.   &apos;Ajax&apos;.3. In conformity with the spirit of the Cabinet&apos;decision, I have given fresh thought to the possibility of offering the Chilean Navy another cruiser instead ofH. M. S.   &apos;Ajax&apos;, from among those which are, or may become,available for diposal.      These are H. M.  Ships *Frobisher&apos;,&apos;Leander&apos;,  &apos;Scylla&apos;,  &apos;Arethusa&apos;,  &apos;Sussex&apos; and Norfolk&apos;.1+. H. M. S.   &apos;Frobisher&apos;, completed in 192J+, is quiteobsolete (her main armament is 7.5-inch guns);   her conditionis so bad as, in my view, to eliminate her from the list of possible alternatives.5. H* M. S.   fLeander&apos; has been extensively robbed of equipment, a good proportion of which would be (at best) verydifficult to replace.      Much work that has been done in preparation for her service as a ship target would be wasted,and would have to be done again in respect of another ship,if she were sold.      In rather exceptional circumstances wehad tentatively agreed (in the interests of Commonwealthgoodwill) to accept this disadvantage in favour of Western Australia; when that State asked whether a ship of hercharacteristics could be sent to Fremontle   to produce power for the public electricity service, which is in imminent danger of breakdown.      The State Government has, however,felt reluctantly obliged to decline this offer, since (among other things) the enormous cost of towing the ship to Australiawas prohibitive.      It must be supposed that the Chileans wouldbe even less ready to accept, as a warship, this vessel whichthe Australians could not even take as a source of power.6. H. M. S.   &apos;Scylla&apos; was completed in 19^+2.      From the chilean point of view, the disadvantages of H. M. S.   &apos;Scylla&apos;would include the facts that she is armed with h* 5-inch guns,and that the results of action damage sustained in 19^1-*coupled with other defects, would take 2h to 30 months to repair.      With every inducement to make good use of her, wein the Admiralty have been unable to do so.COPY NO. 3/

7. H. M. S.   &apos; Are thus a&apos; is destined for radiologicaltrials early in May;   this fact has been publicly announced.I cannot advise that we should jeopardise, or even seriouslydelay,.this important naval work for which she has beenextensively prepared, in order to find an alternative with. M. S.   ?Ajax!.      Although these trials are likely to be com-pleted by the end of July or August next the ship is scheduledfor further shell trials.     Even if it were accepted thatthese might be transferred to another vessel it remains&quot; a fact that, as a ship, H. M* S.   ^rethusa&apos; is in very poor&apos; con-dition and a fair amount of her armament,- power units and fire control gear has been removed.8. All things considered, none of these four ships isin appreciably better condition than H. M. S;   &apos;0rion&apos; from thepoint of view of their being refitted to seagoing efficiency.9. H. M. S.   &apos;Sussex&apos; and H. M. S.   Norfolk&apos; are old ships(completed in 1929 and 1930 respectively) in poor condition;H. M* Si  &apos;Sussex1 is reducing to reserve now, and H. M. S*   Norfolk1will do so on her return from the East Indies in May.     I havenot yet decided to place them on the disposal list, and inany event I- have no reason to suppose that either of these10,000 ton eight-inch cruisers would be acceptable to theChileans instead of the smaller H. M. S.   &apos;Ajax&apos;.10. My conclusion, then, is that there is really no alternative offer that could be made to the Chilean Governmentin place of H. M. S*   &apos;Ajax&apos;.     I am9 therefore, obliged to invite the Cabinet to reconsider the question as -a simplechoice between offering the &quot;Ajax1 to Chile and refusing.11. &quot;It is relevant, in view of the Cabinet&apos;s&quot;expressedreason for seeking an alternative, that a supplementaryquestion asked in the House of Commons on 23rd March(Hansard, Column 359) deliberately mentioned &quot;any other ofH. M.  Ships&quot;.     I doubt whether the substitution of anothername, even if it were practicable, would much affect thecurrent political opposition, such as it is, to the sale.H.Admiralty, S.W.1,28TH MARCH,  1949.
