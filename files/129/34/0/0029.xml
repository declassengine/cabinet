Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1949CONFIDENTIALCP. ($9) 99 -28th April, 1949CABINETREPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL POSITION OF THEUNITED kingdom note by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will remember&apos; that, as a result of the meeting of the consultative Group of Ministers of countries represented in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation, which I attended in Paris in March last, aresolution was adopted covering a number of points for action in connection withthe 1949-50 Programme.To implement Principle I of the resolution, which dealt with financial and monetary stabilisation, participating countries were invited to submit reports on their internal financial position by 1st May. The United Kingdom report,the actual form of which was based on a questionnaire compiled in the Organisa-tion, has now been submitted in Paris, and is circulated herewith for. theinformation of my colleagues.R. S. treasury Chambers, S. W. 1, .28th April, 1949.THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL POSITION OF THEUNITED KINGDOMReport submitted by the United Kingdom to the Organisation for european Economic Co-operationI. The Problem of maintaining Internal Financial Stability   .1. The present problems of maintaining financial stability with which theGovernment of the United Kingdom are faced are to be attributed largely tothe war and to its aftermath. During the war we lost, by physical destructionon land and sea, by deterioration of capital equipment and by sales of foreignassets, about a quarter of our national wealth. Since the war there has therefore been a heavy need to modernise equipment and rebuild houses and factories. Realconsumption, particularly of durable goods, was strictly curtailed during the war;and the war ended with consumers holding an abnormal stock of liquid savings,amounting almost to a year&apos;s normal consumption expenditure, and having alsomany deficiencies of consumption which they have wished to make good.Consumers have therefore wished to spend more and save less than before thewar. The desire to save may also have been affected by the higher level of taxation,and&apos; by the redistribution of income that has taken place partly as a result of amore progressive tax system and the extension of social services : these latterhave, however, contributed to social stability. In the first three years since thewar we obtained, by running an import surplus, considerable relief from internalinflationary pressure. But the necessity to eliminate the import surplus, as wehave done over the last year, added to the inflationary problem in 1948.2.   In spite of the large inflationary pressures that existed for these reasons,many of the overt manifestations of inflation have been successfully avoided.The various measures which have been used to influence wages and prices directlyare detailed in Part II below.   Such measures have not been able to prevent36963 copy No.9 1$ 1
entirely the upward movement of prices, but the worst dangers have been avoided.In addition to internal prices, indices of export and import prices are shown inTable I below. In an economy where import and export of goods and serviceseach amount to some 20 to 25 per cent, of the national income, inflationary move-ments in the rest of the world have repercussions at many points on the internalstructure of prices. As a result of the high level of demand, unemployment has remained far below what in the past was regarded as the practicable minimum; andis now between \\ and 2 per cent, of the industrial population.3. Though the situation in the United Kingdom in the immediate post-war years was one of suppressed rather than open inflation, this did not eliminate allthe disadvantages of inflation. Too high a demand for labour was tending tomake the economy immobile and to make it difficult to expand the undermannedindustries. The high level of demand at home, and the rising level of prices, wastending to discourage exports. Moreover, the apparatus of controls, though ableto moderate some of the effects of inflation, had disadvantages of its own, and could not be completely successful against strong and persistent inflationarypressures. It remained desirable, therefore, not only to control the manifestationsof inflation, but to control the inflationary pressures underlying them. Thisbecame the more possible as the receding tide of war expenditure gave more room for manoeuvre in the Budget.Table IPrices, Wage Rates and Unemployment in the United Kingdom since 1945Wage          Retail Wholesale Import Export UnemploymentRates          Prices Prices Prices?)

Measures taken to maintain Internal Financial Stability(i) Monetary and Credit policy. On 31st March, 1949, the total of the National Debt was  25,168 million,a fall of  453 million since 31st March, 1948. This was mainly due to the overallBudget surplus and to the application of the counterpart sterling in the E.C.Special Account to the redemption of short-term debt. After taking all factorsinto account, the reduction in the floating debt over the year was  645 million.
There is no direct correspondence between these figures and the statistics ofmoney in circulation or the volume of bank deposits, as these are affected by many things besides the repayment of Government debt, and a considerableamount of the floating debt repaid consisted&quot; of the reduction in the sterling balances of overseas holders. At March 1949 both the note circulation and bankdeposits were at the level of March 1948; the bank-note circulation, was 1,250 million on 30th March, 1949, compared with  1,245 million on31st March, 1948, and bank deposits were  5,622 million in March 1949, comparedwith  5,609 million in March 1948.5. Government credit was maintained in 1948 at rates ranging from 3 percent, long-term to J--f per cent, for three months&apos; and six months&apos; borrowing.Financial control over investment was maintained through the year by theT.reasury&apos;s control over new issues of capital and by the co-operation of the banksin regulating their advances policy in accordance with the general principles governing the administration of the Capital Issues Control.6. In the figures shown in Table II below the outstanding total of theNational Debt includes some  6,000 million of small savings securities(i.e., National Savings Certificates, Defence Bonds and Savings Bank deposits,held in limited amounts by small investors and repayable on demand at short notice). .Table IIFinancial Statistics  million	National Debt		Estimated					Currency	Total Net	AdvancesYear?)

The Governmenfs monetary and credit policy for 1949 was outlined bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer in the course of his Budget Statement of6th April, 1949.     .As regards the National Debt, it is intended to use any budgetary surplus,together with other funds available for debt repayment, particularly counterpartsterling in the E.C. Special Account, for the reduction of short-term Governmentdebt in the hands of the.banks and the market.The financial control over investment will continue, and the principles uponwhich the control of capital issues is operated and the banks grant credit facilitieshave been revised to ensure that proposals to raise money for new capital purposes are judged in conformity with the investment programme laid down for 1949 inthe Governmenfs Economic Survey.(ii) Budgetary policy. Budgetary measures have been used as a major instrument of anti-inflationary policy. As expenditure on defence and transitional expendituresconnected with the war have fallen, it has been possible to budget for a consider-able surplus,^ with the object of reducing the level of total demand in the economy as a whole. Rates of tax have been reduced since the war, but with an increasingnational income the tax revenue has not been reduced. In the Budget ofApril 1949 only small tax changes were made : The figures for 1949 in Table IIIbelow are after adjustment for the Budget changes.9. Of the Central Government^ direct expenditure on goods and services,much is on account of defence, and part is on account of the social services. Muchof the transfer payments to persons and most of the transfers to the insurance* It is the Budget of the Central Government rather than those of the national insurance fundsor of the local authorities that has been able to be varied in accord with the&apos; needs of general economic policy; see figures in Table VII at the end of this Report.36963 b 2
funds and to the local authorities is also on account of the social services, whichabsorb.altogether about a third of total Central Government current expenditure.Defence expenditure has, of course, been falling since the war. In 1947 itamounted to about a third of Central Government current expenditure : in 1948and 1949 the proportion can be reckoned at under a quarter. There will, of course,be some increase in defence expenditure in 1949-50 over 1948-49.Table IIIRevenue Account of Central Government^)  millionForecast	1946	1947	1948	for 1949Direct taxes      ..................	1,867	1,668	1,823	1,945Indirect taxes   ..................	1,290	1,485	1,721	1,675Other revenue............      ...	33	43	103	110Total revenue         ............	3,190	3,196	3,647	3,730Current expenditure on goods and services......	1,965	1,490	1,384	1,470National debt interest         ............	530	545	538	535Subsidies.....................	314	410	490	490Social security payments      ...      ......	182	164	163	War pensions and other current transfers to persons	548	254	157	Transfers to other public authorities	344	454	432	455Transfers to private capital account for war damage				and in refund of excess profits tax, &amp;c.	298	306	179	185Total current expenditure ...      ......	4,181	3,623	3,343	3,480Surplus or deficit on current account	-991	-427	304	250Current expenditure plus surplus ...	3,190	3,196	3,647	3,730(&apos;) The various items of Government expenditure and revenue have been defined in this Tableso as to be in line with the official estimates of national income and expenditure. The average ofthe items is therefore different in several respects from that used in the Financial Statement thataccompanies the Budget Speech. On the definitions adopted in the latter document, there was a deficit &quot; above the line &quot; of  703 million in 1946, and a surplus of  260 million in 1947 and of  663million in 1948.10. The revenue surplus of the Central Government in 1949 will, in effect,be available as was that in 1948 for the finance of the country&apos;s investment programme. Some fixed capital formation is performed by the Central Govern-ment itself; but in recent years this has been more than offset by the disposalof surplus war stores.Table IVCapital Account of the Central Government		  million		1946	1947	1948Gross fixed capital formation	163	145	128Change in value of inventories	...     - 42	13	27Less Sales of surplus war stores, &amp;c. ...	...     -287	-236	-257Purchase of Bank of England	58		Total gross capital formation   ...	...     -108	- 78	-102Less Maintenance provision  ...	...     - 13	- 24	- 29Deficit on current account    ......	991	427	-304Net borrowing	870	325	-435In addition to the surplus on the accounts of the Central Government itself,there is a surplus on the accounts of the insurance funds and the local authorities.This, together with the small loss incurred by the nationalised industries, is shownin Table 7 at the end of this Report.11. The policy of maintaining a large budget surplus is being continued.It must, however, be regarded as one aspect of pur whole internal financial policy for the future, which is set out in Part IV below.        -
(iii) Investment Policy12. Investment is being maintained-at a high level so as to replace capital equipment, to improve efficiency, and to build up the working stocks upon whicha smooth flow of production depends. (Gross investment in 1948 was about 22 percent, of the gross national income; and net investment, as usually measured, was16 per cent, of the net national income). The size of the investment programme has, however, to be limited on the one hand to the supply of monetary savings,whether from private or public sources; and, on the other hand, to the suppliesof materials and labour for the investment goods industries. The level of invest-ment is controlled by means of steel allocations and by control over building andcertain building materials. The composition of investment in past years and that proposed for 1949 is shown in the table below. Investment on account of thesocial services is being maintained at the 1948 level; while investment that will increase the output of goods and services that can be sold abroad, particularly for dollars, is being specially favoured.Table VGross Investment, 1947-49Fixed Investment^) Fuel and power        .......     ...Transport, communications and shipping ...Agriculture, forestry and fisheries   ......Other industries        ......     ......Housing (including repairs and maintenance)Other social services   ............Defence and administration   ...      .....Northern Ireland       ......Total   :..Miscellaneous fixed investment        .....Total gross fixed investment .&apos;......      ;.....Inventory Changes, &amp;c.

Investment in National Savings Certificates, Defence Bonds and savings bank deposits, is encouraged by the National Savings Movement, which, thoughhaving official approval is a voluntary organisation. Net savings (i.e., purchasesand deposits less encashments, and excluding repayments of maturing DefenceBonds) have in recent years been as follows :   million1946-47  ..................      3261947-48.............      ......      1901948-49  .........      .........       26The National Savings Movement will continue to receive Government encourage-ment and support in a campaign to link the savings effort with the NationalRecovery effort.36963 b 3
(v) Controls14. Many direct controls continue to be enforced under emergency powersintroduced during the war. In addition, some measures of restraint, similar ineffect to controls, are carried out by voluntary agreement. The rigorous controls over exchange transactions and over imports are necessary not as measures against inflation, but for balance of payments reasons. Similarly, the allocation ofmaterials is not primarily an anti-inflationary measure. Allocation has beenconsidered necessary to meet the case where supplies of materials are scarce, i.e.,where supplies are, for balance of payments (or other) reasons, less than thedemand at the current cost of import (or of home production). At the same time,allocation both tends to moderate price increases and is made to appear fmorenecessary by the inflationary conditions.15. Controls over investment have been referred to above under financial policy and investment policy (sections (i) and (iii) above). By setting a limit tothe total expenditure, and hence resources, devoted to investment at home, suchcontrols have played an important part in moderating inflationary tendencies.It is Government policy to maintain these controls while they continue to benecessary.16. Consumer rationing was introduced in the first place to ensure fairshares among consumers of essential goods which were particularly scarce duringthe war. Until recently, however, consumer rationing must have had also aconsiderable anti-inflationary effect. For, in the first place, the prices of rationedgoods could be very effectively controlled. And, in the second place, as much asa third of total consumption was subject to formal rationing to individualconsumers, and over most of the rest of the field supplies were limited and pricescontrolled. The consequent direct restriction or shortages must have prevented aconsiderable part of the available consumers&apos; purchasing power from everappearing as an effective demand for goods and services. By now, however, manyshortages have disappeared; and over the past year footwear, clothing andfurniture have been derationed. Food continues to be rationed; and rationingor legal restrictions remain for soap and petrol, the domestic consumption of coal and wood, and on the size of newspapers. Though such measures severely restrict the demand for the goods to which they apply, they do not, of course, preventspending in other directions; and direct measures of control can now have little effect in making consumers want to spend less in aggregate.17. In view of the need to maintain stability of prices and incomes, and toprevent a serious inflationary situation developing in which rising pricesresulted in demands for increased wages and salaries, the war-time system of price control was continued over most of the field of personal consumption. Thesystem of food subsidies developed during the war was also continued to preventundue rises in the cost of living. The cost of food subsidies has, however, risenconsiderably since the end of the war, and in 1948-49 was  485 million. Thiscontinued increase was threatening the continuation of the anti-inflationarybudgetary policy, and an upper limit has now been set to the amount of the food subsidies at a level slightly above that of last year. The controlled prices of manufactured goods are revised from time to time, and account is then generallytaken for increases in certain costs; but the control over house rents is particularlysevere and particularly effective.18. To strengthen this general stabilisation, policy, the Prime Minister, ina statement made in February, 1948, while announcing that the government did not propose to interfere with the existing methods of free negotiation and contract, appealed for restraint from all those responsible for deter-mining the level of personal incomes. The statement emphasised &quot; that thereshould be no further general increase in the level of personal incomes withoutat least a corresponding increase in the volume of production.&quot; Both sides ofindustry recognised the need for restraint in this field and gave general support to the Government^ policy as set out in this statement. The Trades UnionCongress expressed their general acceptance of the need for restraint in wage increases; and the Federation of British Industries appealed to its members notbeen a very considerable increase in undistributed profits (see Table VII at theend of this report). This was a very useful supplement to the budget surplus in reducing inflationary pressure in 1948, while at the same time it has enabled to increase as a result, there has
private industry to find out of its own resources more of the additional financeneeded to replace and extend working and fixed capital at higher prices. Therehas been general agreement to continue a policy of moderation and restraint individend distribution in 1949-50. While there have been a substantial numberof wage increases in the period since the Government statement was made (see table I) the statement and the support of this policy by the Trades UnionCongress has undoubtedly been a restraining and moderating influence.(vi) Other Policies19. In previous years, the United Kingdom has perforce had a largeimport surplus, and this has incidentally afforded considerable relief frominflationary pressures at home. In the course of 1948 this import surplus waseliminated, which added to the inflationary pressures at the time the adjustmentwas being made. It is expected that the United Kingdom will remain inapproximate overall balance on foreign account during 1949.20. The level of the overall foreign balance, and the distribution of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s surpluses and deficits with individual countries, is of courseinfluenced by the receipt of Aid under the European Recovery Agreement. Thegeneral effect of receiving Aid has been to relieve inflationary pressure.III. Results of Measures to maintain Internal Financial Stability21. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his &quot;Budget Speech summarised theprogress made in 1948 as follows: &quot;Last year it was our avowed objective to counteract the then existing inflationary pressure . . . and to bring about acomfortable and not excessive degree of disinflation. This, I think, we have succeeded in doing, largely as a result of the considerable Budget surplus thatwas planned last year.&quot;22. The 1948-49 Budget aimed at a large surplus; and in the event thetotal current surplus of all public authorities reached  427 million in 1948. this represented a change of no less than  768 million since 1947, when there wasa deficit of  341 million. (See Table VII at end of this Report.) The growth in the Government surplus had to counterbalance two changes that tended toincrease inflationary pressure during the year. The first of these was the fallin the deficit in the balance of payments. This amounted to  510 million. Thesecond was the increase of about  300 million in gross investment at home. the effectiveness of the disinflationary policy can be measured by the fact that these results were achieved without worsening the inflationary tendencies which werenoticeable in 1947. Indeed the increases in export and investment would nothave been possible without this policy. By its means, consumption in real termswas maintained almost unchanged, while practically the entire expansion in national output went to increase exports and investment.Table vi the Use of National ResourcesPercentages1938 1947 1948Current Expenditure Personal consumption    .........      ...Government current expenditure on goods and services .........Total Investment Gross capital formation at home       ......External investment       ...      ......Gross National Resources ...23. The restraint imposed upon consumption has shown itself in many ways.There has been a check to hasty and extravagant expenditure; there is a. widervariety of goods on sale; stocks have improved and there are fewer shortages:it has been possible to relax the rationing of some consumer goods without fearof an uncontrollable rise in demand; and there has in general been an increasinglycompetitive temper both amongst buyers and sellers.1938	1947	1948	Forecast for 194973	65	62	6214	21	18	1815 -   2	21 -   7	22 -   2	20 0100	100	100	100
24. While the general trend of prices over the past twelve months hasbeen stable or slightly upward, there have been significant price reductions in individual cases. But at the present stage, the abandonment of price controlswould almost certainly lead to higher prices for essential goods. During 1948the index of weekly wage rates (based on June 1947 as 100) increased by four points, two of them in the first three months. The corresponding increase for thewhole of 1947 was about five points, of which four represented the rise in thelast half of the year. These increases in 1948 did not compare unfavourably withthe increase in productivity that took place. The slower rate of increase in the months from March, 1948, compared with the previous trend, must be attributedin large part to the favourable response to the Government&apos;s appeal for restraint in wage negotiations, to the relative stability of retail prices and to the successof the appeal to industry to restrict the increase in distributed profits.25. There is thus evidence of a considerable degree of disinflation in thecourse of 1948. During the year ahead the Government intend to follow the same general policy as last year.IV. Steps proposed to maintain Internal Financial Stability during 194926. During 1949 it is proposed to continue the policies to secure financial stability which have already yielded good results in the past year, and whichhave been described under headings (i) to (v) in Part II above.27. Tt is recognised that tfie success of the policies adopted depends in large part on whether the volume of monetary savings from all sources will be adequate to finance investment without inflation. The way in which it is envisaged thatsaving will be financed in 1949 is set out in Table VII at the end of this Report.Preoccupation with this question also underlay the planning of the Budgetintroduced in April 1949, and to it the Chancellor of the Exchequer devoted animportant part of his Budget Speech : 28 &quot; During 1948, we succeeded in reaching a valuable degree of stability,which we must now preserve. In other words, we must see that the total callsmade on the national income by all our different kinds of expenditure balanceagainst that income, without creating any inflationary pressure.29. &quot; Comparing these calls between the years 1948 and 1949 the firstthings to observe is that there is a change in the foreign balance. We expect,in 1949, to be in balance, compared with being in deficit to the extent of  120million in 1948. Strictly, therefore, we ought to withhold that amount of purchasing power from the home market. But we must remember that, overthe last half-year, we have, in fact, been in balance, so that we can discount agood deal of the effect of this difference, which has already been dealt with by what we planned and carried through last year.30. &apos;&apos; For investment, we estimate our needs as practically the same, or,allowing for the smaller increase in working stocks, perhaps slightly lower. Atany rate, they will need no more financing than last year. On the other hand,Government expenditure shows a large increase between the two fiscal years,principally relating to defence and to the various social services, health, education and so forth ....31. &quot; We must, therefore, make adequate provision to meet this Govern-ment expenditure .... Such expenditure must be paid for out of the currentincome of the community, by taxation., If we do not do this unflinchingly, weshall face inflation. Inflation is not an evil that, once checked, disappears; the threat remains, and we must be on our guard against it.32. &quot; For the same reasons, investment, other than that financed by theGovernment surplus, must be financed by savings-by private savings, that is,savings put aside by companies and other organisations which have investment programmes, or by personal savings, that is, savings put aside by individuals.As regards private savings, there will be an automatic increase in the allowances for depreciation, since these allowances are calculated as a percentage of thehigher costs of new buildings and plant; and, if we maintain the dividend limita-tion policy, as industry has promised to do, we shall continue to have considerableprivate savings in the form of undistributed profits, though probably not muchin excess of those of last year, which amounted to about  500 million.
33. &quot; On the whole, therefore, in view of the general world tendencies whichI have mentioned, and the check on the growth of inflationary pressure which wehave manifestly secured during the past year, and which has probably not yetentirely worked itself out, it seems that we should follow the same generalpolicy as last year for our Budget, though not with so sharp an accent upon the urgent need to check inflation. We should aim at a true revenue surplus which,while in itself very substantial, need not be so large as that realised last year.34. &quot; These are my oroad general conclusions on the disinflationary aspect of the Budget. I would emphasise again what I stressed last year, that, withthe many great uncertainties in the situation, we must remain alert to watch the trend of disinflation, and to arrest it if it threatens to widen into a generallyharmful deflation .... It is, therefore, a most essential aspect of our planningthat it should contain as large a degree of flexibility as possible, so as to enable us to adjust our fiscal and financial situation rapidly to any new circumstancesonce we are convinced that an important change is really taking place.&quot;&apos; 35. The foregoing passages from the Budget Speech describe in general terms the way in which the Government envisages public and private investmentwill be financed in 1948-49. The finance of investment in 1949 is set out intabular form in Table VII below.Table vii the Finance of Investment, 1947-49Current Surpluses of public authorities  (a) Central Government    ............
