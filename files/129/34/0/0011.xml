US DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOYERKMEHPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1949SECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 816th April, 1949CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO,JUNE-JULY 1948FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTTO ORGANISEMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in CP. (48) 209 I informed my colleagues of the adoption by the InternationalLabour Conference of a Convention (No. 87) concerning Freedom of association and the Right to Organise. The text of the Convention was published in cmd. 7638. The operative parts (Articles 1-11) are attached hereto (Annex A)for convenience of reference. The Convention is of considerable importance inthe international field and it was hoped that speedy ratification by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would be possible, particularly in view of theleading part played by the United Kingdom delegation in securing its adoption.2. The law. in Great Britain is in accord with the requirements of theConvention. This, however, is not entirely the case in Northern Ireland. Underthe Trades Disputes and Trade Unions Act (Northern Ireland), 1927, and theCivil Service (Approved Associations) Regulations (Northern Ireland), 1928,civil servants in Northern Ireland do not have the right to join organisations oftheir own choosing. Since this is a specific right conferred by Article 2, the Con-vention could not be ratified in respect of Northern Ireland with the aboveprovision on the Northern Ireland Statute Book.3. International Labour Conventions are usually ratified in respect of theUnited Kingdom as a whole. I understand that the Government of NorthernIreland are not prepared to amend the Act of 1927. Under United Kingdomcurrent constitutional practice, Northern Ireland is self-governing in the matters with which the Convention deals, notwithstanding the theoretical sovereignty ofthe Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ratification in respect of the UnitedKingdom as a whole is not, therefore, practicable on this occasion.4. In view of the importance attached to the Convention, consideration hasbeen given to the possibility of ratification on behalf of Great Britain only. this gives rise to certain legal questions, regarding which my legal advisers have beenin consultation with the legal advisers of the.Foreign Secretary and of the HomeSecretary, and subsequently with the Attorney-General. As a result, it has beenagreed that this is a case in which ratification by the United Kingdom in respect ofGreat Britain only could be regarded as appropriate. It is intended in communi-eating the ratification to the Director-General of the I.L.O. to send with it a note in the terms of Annex B to this memorandum, setting out at length the reasons which have led to ratification by Great Britain only.5.   There are certain political implications which need to be taken intoaccount in considering this question.   A reservation in respect of NorthernIreland in a matter of this kind (for that is what ratification on behalf of GreatBritain amounts to) might be used to criticise Northern Ireland or this countrv36852       - b
Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,6th April, 1949.ANNEX AConvention on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right toOrganise.Part I. Freedom of AssociationArticle each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which thisConvention is in force undertakes to give effect to the following provisions.Article 2Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the rightto establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to joinorganisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.Article 31. Workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, toorganise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes.2. The public authorities shall refrain from any interference which wouldrestrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.Article 4Workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved orsuspended by administrative authority.Article 5Workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations shall have the right to establish andjoin federations and confederations and any such organisation, federation orconfederation shall have the right to affiliate with international organisations ofworkers and employers.or employed in the controversy about relations with Eire. In my opinion, however,it is of the utmost importance that Great Britain should take a strong lead in theinternational field in the matter of Freedom of Association and it would be deplorable-able from the international point of view if we could not, for Great Britain atany rate, state our complete accord with and implementation of this Convention.6. In the circumstances, I propose that a ratification be deposited in respectof Great Britain only and that the ratification should be accompanied by a note to the Director-General of the International Labour Office in the terms of Annex Bto this memorandum. Authority is sought for the issue of a White Paper in theterms of the draft at Annex C to this memorandum, setting out the Government&apos;decision in the matter.7. I am putting forward separately (OP. (49) 80) proposals concerningConvention No. 88 and Recommendation No. 83 on the organisation of the employ-ment service, and I shall be submitting at a later date proposals in regard to theremaining two Conventions adopted at the 31st Session of the Conference.G. A. I.
ANNEX draft Letter to the Director-General of the International Labour office i have the honour to enclose a copy of the ratification by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of Convention (No. 87) concerning Freedom of Association and Pro-tection of the Right to Organise.It will be noted that the ratification is in respect of Great Britain and doesnot extend to Northern Ireland.Under the constitutional practice in the United Kingdom the matters td*which this Convention relates are, in relation to Northern Ireland, matters foi*the Parliament and Government of&apos; Northern Ireland.As you are aware, it is the practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government to ensurethat the law is in accord with the provisions of a Convention before it ratifiesthat Convention.   In the case of this Convention the law in Great Britain isregarded as being in accord with the provisions of the Convention, but the view36892 b 2The provisions of Articles 2, 3 and 4 hereof apply to federations and con-federations of workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations.Article 7The acquisition of legal personality by workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations,federations and confederations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions of Articles 2, 3 &amp;h&amp; 4hereof.Article 81. In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organisedcollectivities, shall respect the law of the land.2. The law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so appliedas to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention.Article 91. The extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shallapply to the armed forces and the police shall be determined by national laws of regulations.2. In accordance with the principle set forth in paragraph 8 of Article 19of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, the ratification ofthis Convention by any Member shall not be deemed to affect any existing law,award, custom or agreement in virtue of which members of the armed forces orthe police enjoy any right guaranteed by this Convention.Article 10In this Convention the term &quot;organisation&quot; means any organisation ofWorkers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers orof employers.Part Xl-Protection of the Right to OrganiseArticle 11Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which thisConvention is in force undertakes to take all necessary and appropriate measuresto ensure that workers and employers may exercise freely the right to organise.
has been taken that this is not entirely the case in Northern Ireland by reasonof the restriction as to membership of organisations which applies to civil servants in Northern Ireland under Section 5 of the Trades Disputes and Trade Unions Act(Northern Ireland), 1927 (17 and 18 Geo. 5, c. 20), and the Civil Service (ApprovedAssociations) Regulations (Northern Ireland), 1928, dated 23rd February, 1928(S.R. &amp; O. (N.I.), 1928, No. 18), made thereunder. Copies of the Act and regulations are enclosed.The power to ratify I.L.O. Conventions both in respect of Great Britainand of Northern Ireland rests in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom. Owing to the state of the law in Northern Ireland, however,it is not possible to ratify this Convention in respect of the United Kingdom asa whole.In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government have given carefulconsideration to the action which they should take, having regard to the factthat in the case of this convention, as, indeed, of all conventions, they feelthat the greatest possible number of ratifications is of the utmost importance,and have decided that the best course, in accordance with the spirit of theobligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Constitution of the I.L.O.,is to ratify the Convention in respect of Great Britain only.With regard to Article 19 (5) of the Constitution, which lays an obligation on the Member to bring the Convention before the authority or authorities withinwhose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action,the position in the case of the United Kingdom is that the authorities in question in relation to this Convention are, for Great Britain, the Parliament at westminster and, for Northern Ireland, the Parliament of Northern Ireland. HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, the purposes of theaction to be taken under the Constitution of the I.L.O., represents the member in this case, is thus in a position to bring the Convention before the parliament at Westminster but not before the Parliament of Northern Ireland, as this latterstep can only be taken by the Government of Northern Ireland.Article 19 (5) further provides in (d) that, if the Member obtains the consentof the authority or authorities in question, it will communicate the formal ratifica-tion of the Convention to the Director-General. In this case the conditionsprecedent for ratification in respect of Great Britain can be said to be satisfied.The position which has thus arisen in relation to Northern Ireland andGreat Britain may not be exactly covered by the letter of any provision of theI.L.O. Constitution.- Similar circumstances are, however, provided for in the caseof federal States and of non-metropolitan territories where the subject-matter ofthe Convention is within the sphere of the constituent States.of the Federationor of the self-governing powers of the territory as the case may be. UnderArticle 19 (7) of the Constitution the obligations of a Federal State are thesame as those of members which are not Federal States only in respectof conventions which the Federal Government regards as appropriate under itsconstitutional system for federal action. In respect of conventions which theFederal Government regards as appropriate under its constitutional system for action in whole or in part by the constituent States, provinces or cantons ratherthan for federal action, the Federal Government is required to comply with other obligations which are designed to ensure that the provisions of the convention are, so far as possible, carried out, even though the Federal Government is unableto ratify the convention. But the relation between the Government of the UnitedKingdom and the Government of Northern Ireland is not the same as that between a Federal Government and one of the constituent States, since so far as GreatBritain is concerned all the powers can be exercised by the Parliament at westminster and it is only as regards part of the United Kingdom, namely,Northern Ireland, that a division of powers exists similar to that existing in a federal State.On the other hand, Northern Ireland is part of the metropolitan territory of the United Kingdom, and, therefore, does not come strictly-within the provisionsof Article 35 of the I.L.O. Constitution. Nevertheless, the constitutional positionof Northern Ireland in relation to Convention 87 is similar to that of a non-metropolitan territory in the case where the subject-matter of the convention is within the self-governing powers of the territory. By virtue of Article 35,a Member is free to ratify a Convention without applying it to such a territory,the obligation of the Member in such a case being to bring the convention to thenotice of the Government of the territory as soon as possible, with a view to the
enactment of legislation or other action by such Government and, if the Govern-ment of the territory agrees, the subsequent making of a declaration of acceptancein respect of the territory. This obligation the Government of the United kingdom have fulfilled by communicating Convention 87 to the Government of NorthernIreland, but, in the circumstances mentioned above, a declaration of acceptanceon behalf of Northern Ireland is not possible. Since the. obligations of theconvention cannot be accepted for Northern Ireland, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare prepared, in relation to Northern Ireland and Convention No. 87, to complywith the requirements of Article 35 (8) of the I.L.O. Constitution by reportingto the Director-General the position of the law and the practice of NorthernIreland in regard to the matters dealt with in the convention.Thus, both in regard to Federal States and in regard to self-governing non-metropolitan territories, the Constitution provides suitable means for dealingwith situations analogous to those prevailing between Great Britain and NorthernIreland, and the general spirit and intention of the Constitution can be inducedfrom these provisions.Consequently, and in the circumstances which have arisen, it appears to HisMajesty&apos;s Government to be within the spirit and intention of the Constitutionof the I.L.O. that they should ratify this Convention for that part of the UnitedKingdom Great Britain in relation to which the Parliament at Westminsterexercises legislative authority in respect of the subject-matter of the convention in question.ANNEX CDraft of White PaperInternational Labour conference convention No. 87 CONCERNING FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION and protection OF THE RIGHT TO ORGANISEThis Convention was adopted by the International Labour Conference at its31st Session in 1948. The English and French texts of the Convention were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 7638.The Convention sets out certain principles concerning freedom of associationas a basis for international regulation of this subject.The law in Great Britain is in accord with the requirements of the Conven-tion. In Northern Ireland, however, under the Trades Disputes and Trade UnionsAct (Northern Ireland), 1927, and the Civil Service (Approved Associations)Regulations (Northern Ireland), 1928, there are certain restrictions as to membership of organisations which apply to civil servants, and consequently, inview of Article 2 of the Convention, which confers on workers a right to joinorganisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation, the viewhas&apos; been taken that the Convention cannot be ratified in respect of NorthernIreland.Accordingly His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to ratify Convention No. 87in respect of Great Britain only.
