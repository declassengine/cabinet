(49) 10710t/i May, 1949CABINETCOMMUNISTS AND FASCISTS : SECRET GOVERNMENT CONTRACTSMemorandum by the Minister of defence. The Committee on Subversive Activities haye been considering how best,in the interests of national security, to improve the measures for excludinguntrustworthy* persons from employment in connection with contracts for secretwork placed by certain Government&quot; Departments with outside contractors. TheCommittee have reached the conclusion that certain action is required and have asked me to report accordingly to the Cabinet.2. The Problem.-Contracts issued by the Admiralty, the Ministry ofSupply . and the Ministry of Works often give to persons employed by the contractors knowledge of our most secret devices and sometimes afford them aninsight into our long-term plans. The employment of untrustworthy persons bycontractors on such work is just as dangerous to the State as is the employmentof untrustworthy persons on secret work in Government Departments. It isknown to the Security Service that there are some 20 untrustworthy persons atpresent employed by Government contractors, whose exclusion from work on secretGovernment contracts is vitally necessary. Some of these hold important postscarrying substantial salaries. There is in addition a considerably larger numberof untrustworthy employees of Government contractors who, however, are eithernot employed directly on the secret work or, although so employed, have smallopportunity of access to or of assimilating the most important secrets. while some of them no doubt represent a security risk, it is considered that it is a risk that, for the time being at least, might be accepted.3. This is not a new problem. For many years it has been the practice forthe Security Service, on behalf of the contracting Departments, to maintainregular and direct contact with Government contractors. The Security Service,acting on behalf of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Supply and on the basisof the contractual clause mentioned in paragraph 5 below, have usually been able,with the willing co-operation of employers, to secure the exclusion from secretGovernment work of untrustworthy persons, mostly in the lower ranges. Theseunobtrusive methods are not, however, likely to be sufficient for the future. It willbe seen from paragraph 2 above that action may be required in respect of some* Note. -In this memorandum, this term is used in the sense in which it has been interpreted in applying to the Civil Service the measures announced by the Prime Minister on 15th March, 1948.Those measures are based on the proposition that no person is to be employed in connectionwith secret work in the Civil Service who is believed to be either:  (i) a member of the Communist Party or of a Fascist organisation ; or(ii) associated with either the Communist Party or a Fascist organisation in such a way as toraise legitimate doubts about his reliability.Civil Servants who come under either category are referred to as &quot; untrustworthy.&quot;37025
quite prominent figures, who would not hesitate to make the most of any attempt, ifthey became aware of it, to remove them by &quot; underhand &quot; means. In any casethe publicity given to the Prime Ministers statement of 15th March, 1948 notto mention the unofficial &apos;&apos; purges &apos;&apos; now being conducted by certain firms in private industry will have focused attention on the matter.4. Our first conclusion is, therefore, that, in respect of untrustworthy personsemployed on secret Government contracts, some form of overt action is requiredsimilar in principle to that applied within the Government service. We do not suggest that action should be taken in every case. It would be for the responsible minister, in consultation with the Ministry of Labour and the Security Service,to decide whether the risk of labour troubles or of political agitation, or thepossible loss of production or of technical efficiency, were likely to outweigh therisk of leakage of information. Where, however, the security risk was paramount,action would be taken in accordance with a settled procedure which would formthe subject of a general Government announcement.5. Measures proposed. The method of excluding untrustworthy persons from employment on secret Government contracts would be as follows. Everycontract for secret work contains a clause giving the Government department concerned the light to require the contractor :  (a) to furnish particulars of all persons who may be concerned with the secret aspects of the work; and(b) not to employ in such work &apos;&apos; any person whatsoever who the Departmentdecides is undesirable &quot; (the decision being final and conclusive).We are advised that this clause gives the Departments concerned all the legal powers necessary to secure the exclusion of untrustworthy persons from secretGovernment work, and it would be under these powers that contracting Depart-ments would exercise their rights in appropriate cases.6. An Advisory Body. The matter cannot, however, end there. What the contractor does to fulfil his contractual obligation is not, strictly speaking, the concern of the Government, which is not the employer of the untrustworthyindividual. It is, however because the Government requires the individual tobe excluded from secret work that the individual is either transferred to other work or discharged altogether (there will be cases in which a contractor, having no other suitable work to offer, has to terminate the employment of the individual).Both contractor and employee will be awkwardly placed by the action of theDepartment, and may look to the Government for some safeguards. Sometimes,too, the allegation of untrustworthiness will be denied. These considerations,and the principle that justice must be manifestly seen to be done, make it in ouropinion inevitable that there should be set up for industrial cases an advisory body exercising functions similar to those of the three advisers who act in CivilService cases. To do without such a body would indeed, in the present temperof Parliament, be politically impossible.7. The advisory body should, we think, be provided by extending the fieldcovered by the Civil Service advisers. There are very strong objections, particu-larly from the point of view of the Security Service, to establishing a new body with separate membership. There would be a risk, not only of information leakingin a particular case, but also of security methods over a considerable area oftheir work being compromised. It would, moreover, be difficult both to find andto secure acceptance of a separate body which had the qualifications of the existingadvisers. No advisory body could adequately consider the cases before themunless they were given all the evidence, and the sources of that evidence weredisclosed. The existing advisers, with their long Civil Service experience, areaccustomed to handling information of the highest secrecy and appreciate therisk of compromising valuable sources. It is believed that, if so requested, theywould be prepared to undertake this new task. It is, however, for considerationhow and at what stage there should be consultation, e.g., with the T.U.C., onsuch a proposal.8. A further argument for using the existing advisory body arises from thequestion of representation of those appearing before the advisers. Civil Servantsappearing before the advisers are not allowed to be legally represented or to be accompanied by a &quot; friend.&quot; Any request, which will undoubtedly be pressed, fora contractor&apos;s employee to be represented could be met with the reply that that
was already ruled out in Civil Service cases, and the advisers would only be follow-ing a common procedure. In the view of the Security Service, which is supportedby the Committee on Subversive Activities, it is essential to maintain the ban onrepresentation.9. Certain miscellaneous points may be mentioned here :  (i) The existence of an advisory body would not in any way derogate fromthe responsibility of the Minister concerned. The decision whetheror not to require an employee&apos;s exclusion from secret government work would be that of the Minister alone. As in Civil Service cases,the Minister would not be bound to follow the advice of the advisers,and they would not be concerned with the action which he might decide to take in the matter,(ii) If a contractor had to pay compensation or damages to an employee forpremature termination of his employment, or salary or wages during any period of suspension, it might be necessary for the Governmentto reimburse the contractor. Similarly, the Government should standbehind any Minister or official who was involved in legal proceedings(see paragraph 10.below).   The Treasury concur in principle.(iii) Except as at (ii) above, the measures proposed in this paper involve noexpenditure.   They call for no additional man-power.10. Legal questions.-We have consulted the Treasury Solicitor and the LawOfficers of the Crown about the legal consequences of excluding untrustworthypersons from Government work by the exercise of contractual rights. The con-tractor, if he terminated the employment of an untrustworthy employee otherwise than in pursuance of the contract of service, e.g., on a week&apos;s or month&apos;s notice,might be liable to a claim for compensation. If he did not meet this claim, or thecompensation he offered was inadequate, the contractor would be liable to an action for damages. The procedure would also create the possibility of actions againstthe Minister or one of his officials or a member of the Security Service (i) for inducing the contractor to break his contract with his employeewithout lawful justification (not, however, where the employee wasdischarged in accordance with his contract of service) with a possibleadditional or alternative claim in conspiracy;(ii) for slander or libel; it might be possible for the employee to work up into a defamatory statement something said to the contractor by theMinister or his officials or a member of the Security Service. (Suchan action might also conceivably be brought against members of theadvisory body themselves in respect of statements made by them to the employee when he appeared before them.)Actions in either of these two classes would almost certainly fail, assuming in thecase of those mentioned in sub-paragraph (i) that no more was done by theMinister than to exercise the right clearly embodied in his contract with the contractor to exclude the employee from secret government work, and in the case of those mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii) that any statements made about the employee to the contractor could either be shown to be true or tohave been made without malice and in the exercise of the Minister&apos;s right torequire the contractor to exclude the employee from secret work. The probableplaintiffs are, however, persons who will be eager to create trouble and to makepropaganda and who may think that they can secure publicity damaging to theGovernment by proceedings. We cannot rule out, therefore, the risk that actionswill be brought although they may not be successful. We think, however, that therisk should be taken.11.   Recommendations.-The Committee on Subversive Activities recom-mend : (a) That the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister of Supply and theMinister of Works should be authorised, in cases where this action -is justified on merits, to exercise their contractual right to require acontractor to exclude from secret Government work any person whothe First Lord or the Minister decides is untrustworthy.(b) That persons affected by (a) should be given the opportunity of appearingbefore an advisory body with a view to rebutting the allegations thatthey are untrustworthy.
(c) That the advisory body before whom such persons appear should comprisethe same members as the advisory body set up for the Civil Service,should follow the same procedure and should be similarly limited by its terms of reference to purely advisory functions.(d) That the measures proposed at (a)-(c) should be publicly announced ina Ministerial statement after such prior consultation as may bedesirable and after the procedure for implementing them has been worked out.I ask the Cabinet to approve these recommendations.A.
