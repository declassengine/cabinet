ihis DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  3VTAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT----.  sPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 8712^ April, 1949CABINETGERMANY: OCCUPATION STATUTE AND ANCILLARYDOCUMENTSNote by the Prime MinisterAT their meeting on 7th April (CM. (49) 26th Conclusions, Minute 3), theCabinet decided to give the Foreign Secretary discretion to conclude the bestagreement he could on the basis of the American drafts for an occupation statute and Tripartite Control Agreement for Germany, but called his attentionto three points on which he was asked to do his best to secure satisfaction.In the absence of the Foreign Secretary, I circulate, for the information ofmy colleagues, a memorandum by the Foreign Office annexing the text of the documents which have been drawn up in Washington, and showing to what extent the Foreign Secretary was able both to meet the wishes of the Cabinet, and todeal with a number of less important points raised on the departmental level.It will be seen that during the final stage of the negotiation the Foreign secretary was able to secure a large measure of satisfaction on all these points.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,12th April, 1949.36889a

SECRETGERMANY : OCCUPATION STATUTE AND ANCILLARY DOCUMENTSMemorandum by the Foreign OfficeAnnexed to this memorandum are the texts of the documents signed by thethree Foreign Ministers in &quot;Washington on 8th April, 1949. The main documentsare : (i) An agreed memorandum on principles governing the exercise of powersand responsibilities of the United States, United Kingdom and french governments following the establishment of the German federal republic (Annex A).(ii) An Occupation Statute, with a covering message to the ParliamentaryCouncil at Bonn from the Foreign Ministers (Annex B and Annex I).(iii) An agreement on Tripartite Controls (Annex C).Previous discussion at their meeting on 7th April (CM. (49) 26th Conclusions, Minute 3), theCabinet decided to give the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs discretion toreach the best agreement he could on the basis of the American proposals. Theycalled his attention, however, to the following points and asked him to do his best to secure complete or partial satisfaction on them: (i) the reappearance of weighted voting, even in -the limited manner proposed by the Americans; &quot;(ii) the omission in the American draft of reserved powers to prevent unfairtrade practices, including internal discrimination against Britishinterests;(iii) the omission of power to exact the repayment of expenditure incurred on behalf of Germany.It will be seen from a study of Annexes A, B and C that the Secretary ofState has been largely successful in covering these points.Weighted voting is now confined solely to matters of foreign trade and foreign exchange, the reference to other &quot; internal action &quot; being omitted. The weightedvote can only be exercised &quot;when action will increase the need for assistancefrom the United States appropriated funds.&quot; Moreover, the weighted vote maynot be used to contravene inter-governmental agreements or the principles ofnon-discrimination. Finally, the draft implies and the United States representa-tives have recognised, that questions of interpretation are subject to simple majority voting and not to weighted vote. This is important, since this interpre-tation would debar the Americans from arbitrarily invoking the weighted vote.Unfair trade practices. This point has now been covered twice. In theOccupation Statute (Annex B) non-discrimination in trade matters is now included among the fields in which powers are reserved under paragraph 2b. It alsoappears in paragraph 5 of the Tripartite Control Agreement (Annex C).Repayment of expenditure incurred on behalf of Germany. In addition toa reference to &quot; foreign interests in Germany and claims against Germany,&quot; theSecretary of State has secured the acceptance of an agreed minute (Annex E) inwhich the three Governments proclaim their intention of drawing up proposalsfor the settlement of financial claims against Germany, claims arising out ofthe war which remain unsettled, and claims in respect of Allied property inGermany. The intention is also proclaimed in this minute of seeking formal recognition of such claims from the German Federal Government.36889b
In addition to the above points raised at the Cabinefs meeting, there were a number of other matters to which attention was drawn by interested GovernmentDepartments.   These included : (i) Objections to the form of the Occupation Statute, i.e., its failure toprovide an adequate legal basis for relations between the germans and ourselves.(ii) The omission of the Revision Clause in the Occupation Statute.(iii) Omission of any provision for requiring the German Government topay compensation to its own nationals in respect of Allied seizure ofGerman external assets or reparations. On this point there areinternational commitments.(iv) The proposal to establish Tripartite Commissions in each Land.(v) The reference to the desirability of reducing occupation troops in the tripartite Control Agreement.(vi) Inclusion of the Western sectors of Berlin in the area to be governed bythe Tripartite Control Agreement.These points have been met in the following way : (i) Tewt of the Occupation Statute. This is now to be in the form of a proclamation rather than of a letter from the Military Governors tothe Parliamentary Council.(ii) Revision Clause. This has been included (see clause 9 of the Statute).(iii) Compensation. We have not been able to secure a specific reference inthe Occupation Statute to the reservation of powers in this connection.It is the view of the Americans, however, that this matter is coveredby restitution and reparations under paragraph 2b of the occupation statute, and we have been assured that the Americans are equallymindful of international commitments.(iv) Tripartite Commissions. Instead of having Tripartite Commissions ineach Land, the High Commission will be represented by a Land Com-missioner who will be solely responsible to the Commission. He willbe a national of the Power in whose Zone the Land is situated. Theother Powers will be represented only by observers without executive functions. (Paragraph 9 of the Tripartite Control Agreement(Annex C).)(v) Occupation Troops. It has been agreed to cut out the reference to thereduction of occupation troops in the Tripartite Control Agreement(Annex C).(vi) Berlin. It has been agreed to omit the reference to the Western sectors of Berlin in the Tripartite Control Agreement and an agreed minute(Annex D) has been drawn up providing for the principles of thisagreement to be applied so far as practicable to the Western sectors of Berlin.The signature of these texts completes the Allied side of the preparatory work which is necessary for the establishment of a Government for western germany. The remaining hurdle before us is the elaboration of the Basic Law(Provisional Constitution).Here the principal conflict concerns the financial provisions of the Basic Law,with the French and Americans backing the Right wing and Federalist ChristianDemocrats, and ourselves backing the Social Democrats in favour of a morecentralised solution.The three Foreign Ministers have drawn up a message on the Basic Law(attached at Annex H) to be delivered&quot; to the Parliamentary Council by theMilitary Governors at a time to be determined by them.The Military Governors have been instructed to inform the ParliamentaryCouncil that the Foreign Ministers will sympathetically consider any solution inthe Basic Law which guarantees financial independence and adequate strengthfor both the Laender and Federal Governments in their respective fields.The Foreign Ministers&apos; message also indicates that they would agree to allow the Federal State to supplement from its own revenues appropriations made bythe Laender from revenues from their own taxes levied and collected by them, bygrants for education, health and welfare purposes, subject in each case to the specific approval of the Bundesrat (Upper House).
The acceptance by the United States and French Governments of the principlethat the Federal Government should be allowed to help those Laender which arein greater need than other Laender is a concession to the Social Democrats, whohave always maintained that Western Germany would not be viable if the federal government were not allowed this power.It remains to be seen whether this concession to the S.P.D. will be sufficientto persuade them to reach agreement with the Christian Democrats on the basic law. Nevertheless,, the agreement reached in Washington now places squarelyon the Germans all responsibility for any further delay. This circumstance mayact as a spur, since both parties are now anxious to have a Government in western germany.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,11th April, 1949.ANNEX A    .Agreed Memorandum regarding Principles governing Exercise of Powersand Responsibilities of United States-United Kingdom-french governments following Establishment of German Federal Republici. The Governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Franceretain the supreme authority assumed by them under the declaration signed at berlin on 5th June, 1945, including the right to revoke or alter any legislative or administrative decisions in the three Western Zones of Germany.2. Generally speaking, the German governing authorities, whether federalor Land, shall be at liberty to take administrative and legislative action, and suchaction will have validity if not vetoed by the Allied authority. This means that military Government will disappear, and that the functions of the Allies shallbe mainly supervisory.3. There will be certain limited fields in which the Allies.will reserve theright to take direct action themselves, including the issuance of orders to Germanofficials at both the federal and local levels. However, these fields will be restricted to a minimum; and aside from security matters the exercise of direct powers bythe Allies should be regarded as temporary and self-liquidating in nature.4. Upon the coming into being of the German Federal Republic, theresponsibility for supervision of the utilisation of funds made available by theUnited States Government to the German economy for purposes of relief as wellas of recovery will rest with the Economic Co-operation Administration. Suchcontributions as the United Kingdom (and French) Governments agree to makeshall be within the inter-European payments agreement. It is understood thatthe German Federal Republic should become a party to the Convention for Euro-pean Economic Co-operation and execute a bilateral agreement with the Govern-ment of the United States.5. With the establishment of the German Federal Republic and the termina-tion of Military Government, the functions of the Allied authorities shall be divided, military functions being exercised by a Commander-in-Chief and allother functions by a High Commissioner. Each of the Allied establishments inGermany aside from occupation forces shall come under the direction of the HighCommissioner. The three High Commissioners together will constitute the allied high Commission.6. It is the aim of the three Governments to restrict to a minimum the size of the staffs maintained within Germany for the above purposes.7. It is a major objective of the three Allied Governments to encourage and facilitate the closest integration, on a mutually beneficial basis, of the Germanpeople under a democratic federal State within the framework of a Europeanassociation.36889
ANNEX BText of Occupation StatuteIn the exercise of the supreme authority which is retained by the Governmentsof France, the United States and the United Kingdom, General Pierre Koenig,Military Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the French Zone of Germany,General Lucius D. Clay, Military Governor and Commander-in-Chief of theUnited States Zone of Germany, and General Sir Brian Hubert Robertson,Military Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the British Zone of Germany, dohereby jointly proclaim the following Occupation Statute : 1. During the period in which it is necessary that the occupation continue,the Governments of France, the United States and the United Kingdom desireand intend that the German people shall enjoy self-government to the maximum possible degree consistent with such occupation. The Federal State and the participating Laender shall have, subject only to the limitations in this instrument,full legislative, executive and judicial powers in accordance with the Basic Lawand with their respective constitutions.2. In order to ensure the accomplishment of the basic purposes of the occupa-tion, powers in the following fields are specifically reserved, including the rightto request and verify information and statistics needed by the occupation authorities : (a) Disarmament and demilitarisation, including related fields of scientific research, prohibitions and restrictions on industry, and civil aviation;(&amp;) Controls in regard to the Ruhr, restitution, reparations, decartelisation,deconcentration, non-discrimination in trade matters, foreign interestsin Germany and claims against Germany;(c) Foreign affairs, including international agreements made by or on behalfof Germany;(d) Displaced persons and the admission of refugees;(e) Protection, prestige, and security of Allied forces, dependants, employees,and representatives, their immunities and satisfaction of occupation costs and their other requirements;(/) Respect for the Basic Law and the Land constitutions;(g) Control over foreign trade and exchange;(h) Control over internal action, only to the minimum extent necessary toensure use of funds, food and other supplies in such manner as toreduce to a minimum the need for external assistance to Germany;(i) Control of the care and treatment in German prisons of persons chargedbefore or sentenced by the courts or tribunals of the Occupying powers or Occupation Authorities; over the carrying out of sentences imposed on them; and over questions of amnesty, pardon or release in relationto them.3. It is the hope and expectation of the Governments of France, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom that the Occupation Authorities will not haveoccasion to take action in fields other than those specifically reserved above. TheOccupation Authorities, however, reserve the right, acting under instructions oftheir Governments, to resume, in whole or in part, the exercise of full authorityif they consider that to do so is essential to security or to preserve democratic government in Germany or in pursuance of the international obligations of their governments. Before so doing, they will formally advise the appropriate german authorities of their decision and of the reasons therefor.*4. The German Federal Government and the Governments of the Laendershall have the power, after due notification to the Occupation Authorities, to legislate and act in the fields reserved to these authorities, except as the Occupa-tion Authorities otherwise specifically direct or as such legislation or action wouldbe inconsistent with decisions or actions taken by the Occupation authorities themselves. ,5. Any amendment of the Basic Law will require the express approval ofthe Occupation authorities before becoming effective. Land constitutions, amend-ments thereof, all other legislation, and any agreements made between the Federal
State and foreign Governments, will become effective twenty-one days after officialreceipt by the Occupation authorities unless previously disapproved by them,provisionally or finally. The Occupation authorities will not disapprove legis-lation unless in their opinion it is inconsistent with the Basic Law, a Landconstitution, legislation or other directives of the Occupation authorities them-selves or the provisions of this instrument, or unless it constitutes a grave threat to the basic purposes of the Occupation.6. Subject only to the requirements of their security, the occupation authorities guarantee that all agencies of the Occupation will respect the civilrights of every person to be protected against arbitrary arrest, search or seizure;to be represented by counsel; to be admitted to bail as circumstances warrant;to communicate with relatives; and to have a fair and prompt trial..7. Legislation of the Occupation authorities enacted before the effective dateof the Basic Law shall remain in force until repealed or amended by the Occupa-tion authorities in accordance with the following provisions : (a) Legislation inconsistent with the foregoing will be repealed or amended to make it consistent herewith.(&amp;) Legislation based upon the reserved powers referred to in paragraph above, will be codified,(c) Legislation not referred to in (a) and (6) will be repealed by the occupa-tion authorities on request from appropriate German authorities.8. Any action shall be deemed to be the act of the Occupation authorities under the powers herein reserved, and effective as such under this instrument,when taken or evidenced in any manner provided by any agreement betweenthem. The Occupation authorities may in their discretion effectuate their decisionseither directly or through instructions to the appropriate German authorities.9. After twelve months and in any event within eighteen months of the effective date of this instrument the Occupying Powers will undertake a reviewof its provisions in the light of experience with its operation and with a viewto extending the jurisdiction of the German authorities in the legislative, execu-tive and judicial fields.ANNEX CText of Agreement on Tripartite controls the Governments of the United Kingdom, France and the United States agreeto enter into a trizonal fusion agreement prior to the entry into effect of theOccupation Statute. The representatives of the three Occupying Powers willmake the necessary arrangements to establish tripartite control machinery forthe western zones of Germany, which will become effective at the time of theestablishment of a provisional German Government. The following provisionsagreed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, France and the United Statesshall form the basis of these arrangements: 11. An Allied High Commission composed of one High Commissioner of eachOccupying PoWer or his representative shall be the Supreme Allied Agency ofControl.2. The nature and extent of controls exercised by the Allied High Corn-mission shail be in harmony with the Occupation Statute and international agreements.3. In order to permit the German Federal Republic to exercise increasedresponsibilities over domestic affairs and to reduce the burden of occupation costs,staff personnel shall be kept to a minimum.4. In the exercise of the powers reserved to the Occupation authorities to approve amendments to the federal constitution, the decisions of the Allied High-Commission shall require unanimous agreement.
ANNEX DAgreed Minute regarding Western Sectors of BerlinIt was agreed that the provisions of the agreement as to Tripartite controlsshall be applied as far as practicable to the Western Sectors of Berlin.5. In cases in which the exercise of, or failure to exercise, the powersreserved under paragraph 2 (G) of the Occupation Statute would increase theheed for assistance from United States Government appropriated funds, thereshall be a system of weighted voting. Under such system the representatives ofthe Occupation Authorities will have a voting strength proportionate to the fundsmade available to Germany by their respective Governments. This provisionshall not, however, reduce the present United States predominant voice in J.E.I.A.and J.F.E.A. while these organisations, or any successor organisation to them,continue in existence and are charged with the performance of any of their presentfunctions. No action taken hereunder shall be contrary to any inter-Governmentalagreement among the signatories or to the principles of non-discrimination.6.   On all other matters action shall be by majority vote.7. (A) If a majority decision alters or modifies any inter-Governmentalagreement which relates to any of the subjects listed in paragraphs 2 (A) and 2 (B)of the Occupation Statute, any dissenting High Commissioner may appeal tohis Government. This appeal shall serve to suspend the decision pendingagreement between the three Governments.(B) If a High Commissioner considers that a majority decision conflicts withany inter-Governmental agreement which relates to any of the subjects inparagraphs 2 (A) and 2 (B) of the Occupation Statute or with the fundamental principles for the conduct of Germany&apos;s external relations or with matters essentialto the security, prestige, and requirements of the Occupying Forces, he may appealto his Government. Such an appeal shall serve to suspend action for thirty days,and thereafter unless two of the Governments indicate that the grounds do not justify further suspension.(C) If such appeal is from an action of the Allied High Commission eitherdeclining to disapprove or deciding to disapprove German legislation, such legisla-tion shall be provisionally disapproved for the duration of the appeal period.8. A High Commissioner who considers that a decision made by less thanunanimous vote involving any other matter reserved by the Occupation Statuteis not in conformity with basic tripartite policies regarding Germany, or that aLand constitution, or an amendment thereto, violates the Basic Law, may appealto his Government. An appeal in this case shall serve to suspend action for aperiod not to exceed twenty-one days from the date of the decision unless all three Governments agree otherwise. If such appeal is from an action of theAllied High Commission either declining to disapprove or deciding to disapproveGerman legislation, such legislation shall be provisionally disapproved for the duration of the appeal period..9. All powers of the Allied High Commission shall be uniformly exercised in accordance with Tripartite policies and directives, to this end in each Landthe Allied High Commission shall be represented by a single Land Commissionerwho shall be solely responsible to it for all tripartite affairs. In each Land theLand Commissioner shall be a national of the Allied Power in whose zone, the Landis situated. Outside his own zone each High Commissioner will delegate an observer to each of the Land Commissioners for purposes of consultation and information. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the functionsof bodies established pursuant to inter-Governmental agreement.10. To the greatest extent possible all directives and other instruments ofcontrol shall be addressed to the Federal and/or Land authorities..11. The Trizonal Fusion Agreement will continue in force until altered by agreement among the Governments.
778ANNEX E-   Agreed Minute on Settlement of Financial Claims against germany the Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States will proceed, in consultation with other Governments concerned, to develop proposalstor the settlement of financial claims against Germany, claims arising out ofthe war which remain unsettled, claims with respect to Allied property inGermany, and other questions of an economic or legal character arising out of theexistence of a state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. There shouldalso be appropriate consultation with the German Federal Republic. Prior to therelinquishment of reserved powers in the field of foreign exchange, the three governments will give consideration to the desirability of obtaining from theGerman Eederal Government formal recognition of such claims.ANNEX FAgreed Minute on Wuerttemberg and BadenIt was agreed that the status quo in Wuerttemberg and Baden would bemaintained for the time being and that the plebiscite recommended by the german minister Presidents would be postponed in the interest of avoiding any possible delay in the establishment of the German Federal Government. It was further agreed that the question of the Wuerttemberg-Baden Land boundaries would bere-examined after the establishment of the German Federal Government.ANNEX GAgreed Minute on KehlThe French control authorities, with the assistance of the Strasbourg french authorities, will maintain under existing conditions jurisdiction over the Kehlport zone until establishment of the German Federal Government and conclusionof negotiations between the French and German authorities with respect to a jointport administration for Kehl.It was agreed, on a proposal of the French Government, that the City of Kehlwould gradually be returned to German administration. It was foreseen that theFrench temporarily domiciled in Kehl might remain during a four-year periodrequired for the preparation Of additional housing in Strasbourg. Around one-third of the French inhabitants will be able to leave Kehl within several months,and the remainder progressively thereafter as housing becomes available.The final decision with respect to the Kehl port zone will be made in the peace settlement. If the port authority develops harmoniously the United States and united Kingdom will be willing at the time of the peace settlement to bring an attitude of good-will toward the establishment of a permanent joint authority.ANNEX HText of Instruction to the Military Governors with regard to the basic LawFor your guidance the Foreign Ministers transmit herewith their views onthe Basic Law. It is left to the Military Governors to determine the time theymay consider it appropriate to communicate these views to the ParliamentaryCouncil, but the Foreign Ministers wish that they be transmitted before opinion
in the Parliamentary Council has crystallised in order that the views given belowmay be reflected in the Basic Law.&quot; (a) The Foreign Ministers are not able to agree at this time that Berlinshould be included as a Land in the initial organisation of the german federal Republic.(6) In the financial field any provisions put forward by the ParliamentaryCouncil in the direction of securing financial independence and.adequate strength for both the Laender and Federal governments in operating in their respective fields will receive sympathetic consideration.(c) On the question of Article 36 ^Article 95 (C)) they will also give sympathetic-thetic consideration to any formula which: (i) Eliminates from the Federal Powers those matters definitelyexcluded by the London Agreement,(ii) Assures to the Laender sufficient powers to enable them to-be independent and vigorous governmental bodies,(iii) Assures to the Federal Government sufficient powers in theimportant fields of government to enable them to deal effectively with those fields in which the interests of more than one Landare substantially and necessarily involved.(d) Finally, the Foreign Ministers request that the Military Governorsindicate to the Parliamentary Council at an appropriate time thatthey are ready to contemplate a suggestion for right of the FederalState to supplement from its own revenues appropriations made by theLaender from revenues from their own taxes levied and collected bythem, by grants for education, health and welfare purposes, subject in each case to specific approval of the Bundesrat.&quot;ANNEX. IMessage from Foreign Secretaries for delivery to Parliamentary council by the Military Governors&quot; The Foreign Ministers have considered the problem of a Federal german republic in all its aspects in Washington and have come to a number of important decisions of policy in regard thereto. They have decided that, in general, theGerman authorities shall be at liberty to take administrative and legislative action,and that such action will have validity if not vetoed by Allied authorities. Therewill be certain limited fields in which the Allies will reserve the right to take direct action themselves and which are set out in the Occupation Statute, a copy of whichis attached hereto.With the establishment of the German Federal Republic, military government as such will terminate and the functions of the Allied authorities will be divided control functions being exercised by a High Commissioner and military functions by a Commander-in-Chief. The three High Commissioners together will consti-tute an Allied High Commission, and it is the aim of the three Governments to restrict to a minimum the size of the supervisory staffs attached to their respectiveHigh Commissioners.Foreign Ministers further affirm that it is a major objective of the threeAllied Governments to encourage and facilitate the closest integration on amutually beneficial basis of the German people under a democratic Federal Statewithin the framework of a European association.Nevertheless, before the far-reaching developments which they contemplatecan be put in hand, it is essential that an agreement should be reached by theParliamentary Council upon a basic law for the German Federal Republic.&quot;
