JMIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (u10) 752ND APRIL,  19^copy NO. OfCABINETREMUNERATION OF TRAINED NURSESMemorandum by the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for scotland. A claim has been made on the Nurses and MidwivesWhitley Council in the National Health Service, by theStaff Side representing the nurses, for increased pay forthree grades of general nurse - the enrolled assistantnurse, the staff nurse and the ward sister.2. Notwithstanding the need for keeping down thecost of the National Health Service, v/e consider that,while the claim should not be conceded in full, someincreases are warranted without contravening the policy laid down in the White Paper on Personal Incomes, costs and Prices (Gmd. 7321).      Our reasons are -(a) There is a great shortage of nurses and morerecruits of good calibre must be attracted to nursing.Returns submitted by the hospital authorities show thaton 31st December, 1948, there were 60,000 beds unstaffed.Many of the hospitals have long waiting lists of patients.(b) While the pay of nurses has been improved inrecent years, it is- still low compared with comparableprofessions, especially ?/hen account is taken of anurse&apos;s hours of work (not less than 96 per fortnight),the arduous nature of her duties and her liability tonight and weekend duty, for which no extra remuneration,such as overtime, is payable.(c) The remuneration of student nurses was put ona satisfactory footing last September, and a settlement for the trained grades is overdue.(d) There are serious anomalies between the pay ofthe lower grades of trained nurse and that of certainancillary grades such as ward orderlies, and these mustbe corrected.

3* The present scales, the scales claimed by the staff side and our proposals are set out in the following-table:-adePresent scalesStaff Side ClaimProposed scales(inclusive basis)lied&apos; stante 120- 170 ( 160 inScotland)Plus 100emolu-men emoluments  220- 270( 260 in .Scotland) 230- 350Plus 120emolu-ment s 350- l4-70 285- 385fe 1 kO- 200Plus 100emolu-ments=  2AjO- 300 260- 380Plus 120  380- 5O0emolu-ments 315- 413r&quot;e 180- 260Plus 1 20emolu-ment s 3&apos;00- 380 350- 490Plus 130emolu-mentsa  480- 620 375- 500plus  50 forteaching dutiesThe present scales given in this table are those for women.The men &apos;s scales are slightly higher at most points.k- After taking account of the increased income taxpayable on an inclusive salary over that payable on a cashsalary pins free emoluments, these proposals represent an actual increase in the pocket of the resident female nurse atthe minimum and the maximum of the scales, of the followingamounts per year:-Grade	Minimum	MaximumEnrolled Assistant Nurse	 18.  16s. 3d	 kh.    9s. 1d (England &amp; Wales)  52.  13s. 1d (Scotland)Staff Nurse	 21.    8s.11d	 2+1.    1s. 2dWard Sister	 20.     1 s.   8d	 45.    5s.  9d5. In framing our proposals we have had regard to theneed to avoid repercussions in other comparable fields,particularly the medical auxiliary grades in hospitals, andthe teaching profession.

2ND APRIL,  1949.6. Allowing for the consequential salary adjustments inother nursing grades and in other fields such as mental nursingand midwifery, we estimate the annual cost of our proposals, on present. numbers of staff, to be about  hjr million.      In so faras additional nurses are recruited it will be greater.     this estimate is of net extra expenditure, allowance being made forthe extra income tax paid back to the Exchequer.     The grossannual cost is estimated at  7*8 million, of which  2.8 million is the cost for the three grades in the present proposals and 5 million for the consequential adjustments.7. A special point arises on the salary scales for malenurses.      Hitherto, while there has been no system of uniformdifferentiation between the scales for the two sexes, therehave been a number of minor differences.      These have arisenpartly through the impossibility of recruiting men-at the very low women&apos;s rates and partly because male and female nurseshave been paid on a different basis, the men receiving aninclusive weekly wage, and the women a monthly cash salary plusfree emoluments.     The difference in favour of the men hasvaried from about  20 a year in the lower ranges to  12 in themiddle ranges, tapering away to nothing at the maximum of theward sister&apos;s scale.      The Staff Side are asking for scalescommon to men and women.8. &apos; We realise that this aspect has to be viewed inrelation to general policy about the application of &quot;equal pay&quot;.      It may be feared that the removal of present differan-tials in nurses&apos; salaries may be construed as the applicationof common scales in a new field and so provoke claims andrepercussions elsewhere, in the Civil Service, amongst teachers and outside.9. Our proposals, and the figures of cost, are related to women&apos;s scales.      If for fear of repercussions, it is thought desirable to maintain the present differentials, it would benecessary to increase the scales proposed and this would costan additional  60,000.      Later, if the application of commonscales is conceded, and women&apos;s rates have to be raised to themen&apos;s, there would be a further cost of  i+75,000 per annum on present numbers of nurses.      This is a substantial price to pay for maintaining what is after all not a formal system of salarydifferentiation, but merely a collection of minor variations.If it is necessary to preserve a measure of differentiation, wethink that the principle of differentiation can be sufficientlysafeguarded at much less cost if the male nurses are given a slightly higher starting point (e.g.  one increment up; on the  .scales for the enrolled assistant nurse and the staff nurse,the maxima of these two grades and the whole scale of the wardsister grade being the same for both sexes..    These higherminima are in any case desirable for male nurses to avoidanomalies with the wages of male domestic staff.10. The present proposals have been discussed at theofficial level with the Treasury, who are in broad agreementwith them, subject to a reservation on the point about equal pay (paragraphs 7 - 9), but they have not been discussed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.11. .   We would like agreement to our proceeding on- theselines.A. B.A. W.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.
