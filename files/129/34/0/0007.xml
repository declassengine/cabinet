PNFIDENTIALREPORT BY WORKING party ( Following on the decision of the Cabinet at their meeting ort20th January, 1949 (C.M. (49) 5th Conclusions, Minute 4), we were invited bythe Government Organisation Committee (G.O.C. (49) 1st Meeting, Minute 6)to examine the allocation between the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and Common-wealth Relations Office of responsibility for the administration of overseas terri-tories and to consider the desirability of changing the name of the Colonial Office.We understood that the Cabinet bad felt that it might be a logical arrangement to transfer to the Colonial Office responsibility for some, if not &quot;all, of the overseas territories for which the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office nowaccept some measure at least of responsibility and that the present name of theColonial Office was one of the main obstacles to this.2.   The questions remitted to us can be considered under three heads :-(I) Are there good reasons for transferring to the administration of theColonial Office any of the territories for which (a) the Foreign office or (6) the Commonwealth Relations Office are now responsible?(II) The title of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and his Department,(III) Arrangements whereby the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Rela-tions Office can have access to the Colonial Office&apos;s specialist know-ledge and experience of overseas administration.I (a). Territories for which Responsibility lies with the Foreign SecretaryBritish Zones of Germany and Austria3. The British Zones of Germany and Austria are administered by theForeign Office German section. The Foreign Office is organised mainly forduties in the sphere of foreign policy and, unless special arrangements are made,,is therefore not well equipped to assume responsibility for the administrationof overseas territories. But in view of the extent to which the Foreign Secretarymust, in present circumstances, concern himself with all questions of policyaffecting Germany and Austria, it was considered essential that he should alsobe responsible for their administration and, for this reason, responsibility forthese territories was transferred to the Foreign Secretary in April 1947: the separate Department which had been set up at the end of the war to administer the British Zone of Occupied Germany under the Chancellor, of the Duchy of lancaster was then constituted the German Section of the Foreign Office andincorporated the German Political Department. This unit remains, however,administratively distinct from the Foreign Office proper and has its ownPermanent Under-Secretary responsible to the Foreign Secretary.Cyrenaica and Tripolitania4. The Cabinet decided on 20th January, 1949 (CM. (49) 5th Conclusions,Minute 4), that, in view of the importance which the question of the disposal ofthese territories had generally in international affairs and in particular in ourrelations with the Arab States, the Foreign Office should take over responsibilityfor the administration of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. A new Foreign OfficeSection (Administration of African Territories) is accordingly being set up forthis purpose. This arrangement is necessary for much the same reasons as apply in regard to the British Zones of Germany and Austria.Eritrea and Italian Somaliland5. The Foreign Office and the Colonial Office have agreed that the ForeignOffice should accept responsibility for these territories during the interim perioduntil their future is decided by the United Nations. If, however, the united nations should fail to come to a fairly early decision on the matter or if the territories are to remain in British hands, the Foreign Office will wish the ques-tion of permanent responsibility to be examined further. Without prejudgingthe result of such an enquiry, we note that the Foreign Office and Colonial Officeagree that, if Italian Somaliland were under British administration on a per-manent basis, it could best be administered by the Colonial Office; and that, if36847 m
Eritrea should be divided in such a way as to leave in British hands a part too small to exist as a satisfactory independent unit, this part might be linked withthe administration of the Sudan.A nglo-Egyptian Sudan6. The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan is administered by a Governor-General whois responsible under the Condominium Agreements to the Egyptian Government andto His Majesty&apos;s Government. The activities of the Foreign Office are, however,in practice confined to providing the administration with practical advice and guidance on policy questions. There seems to be no case for transferring thisfunction to the Colonial Office and, whether or not the name of the Colonial office were changed, such a transfer would be likely to be most unwelcome to theEgyptian Government.The A rab States of the Persian Gulf7. On 1st April, 1947, His Majesty&apos;s Government took over from the Govern-ment of India the direct control of our relations with the Arab States of thePersian Gulf. These are quasi-independent protected States in which we main-tain a Political Resident and a number of political posts. Before this transferwas made the Cabinet discussed in January, 1947 (CM. (47) 4th Conclusions,Minute 2\, which Department should assume responsibility for our relations withthese States.8. On the one hand it was felt that the Colonial Office had much experienceof indirect rule and administrative work of this sort; already had local associa-tions with Arabia by reason of their administration of Aden; and could providethe Colonial Service administrative and other staffs with knowledge of Arabianproblems.9. On the other hand it was suggested that, since the principal questions-affecting His Majesty&apos;s Government in this area were political questions con-cerning relations with neighbouring foreign countries, viz., Iraq, Persia andSaudi Arabia, and with the oil companies (in which there was a large UnitedStates interest), it would in many ways be more appropriate that the ForeignOffice should accept responsibility. Moreover, Colonial Office control of quasi-independent rulers might be misrepresented as an intrusion of British*&apos; Imperialism &quot; in this region, again whether or not the name of the department were changed.10. On balance, therefore, the Cabinet decided that the Foreign office should take over direct responsibility for these posts. The change was made on1st April, 1948, without the need to create any new or separate administrative units. We think that the considerations on which this decision was based stillapply and that the present.arrangements should continue.11. One new consideration brought to our notice was that, since the ColonialOffice is no longer concerned with Palestine, it may find difficulty in maintaining the cadre of Colonial Service officers with intimate knowledge of Arab problems which, with continued responsibility for Aden and the Arab communities on theEast African coast, it will still require. We do not think that this is so important as to justify a transfer of responsibility, but we suggest that any oppertuinities which may arise for interchange of staff between the Foreign Office and theColonial Office, joint training, &amp;e., should be taken. We note that a conference is to be held in Aden later this year at which officials of the two services will be encouraged to exchange ideas and to discuss joint training arrangements, &amp;c.I (&amp;). Territories for which the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relationsis responsible12. These are the High Commission territories in South Africa, viz., Basuto-land, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland. These Territories are underthe supervision of the Commonwealth Relations Office rather than of the ColonialOffice because of their close geographical and economic connection with the Unionof South Africa, and of the implication in the South Africa Act of 1909, which made provision for the possible eventual transfer of the Government of the terri-tories to the Union of South Africa. The United Kingdom Government arepledged to co-operate with the Union Government in regard to the administration
of the Territories, and for this purpose it has been considered convenient that HisMajesty&apos;s High Commissioner for the High Commission Territories should be theofficer who also holds the post of United Kingdom High Commissioner in theUnion. It would clearly be inconvenient if the High Commissioner dealt with two different Government Departments in this country. The commonwealth relations Office work in close collaboration with the Colonial Office in matters relating to the development and administration of these Territories.13. In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 24th January, 1949, the PrimeMinister said : &quot; There are special reasons for these Territories being dealt within the Commonwealth Relations Office, but that Department keeps in close liaison with the Colonial Office in regard to their development and affairs generally.The hon. Member may be satisfied that the Territories are at no sort of disad-vantage because of this arrangement &quot; (Official Report, col. 562). We recommendthat no change should be made.II. Title of the Colonial Office14. The main reasons urged in favour of a change of title are, we imagine,first, that the present title is not altogether appropriate, since some of the territories under the Colonial Office are not, technically speaking, Colonies ;*secondly, that the existence of this title may hamper the transfer to the ColonialOffice of territories which had best been administered by that Department; and thirdly, that the title &quot; Colonial Office &quot; is liable to give rise to misunderstanding,particularly in the United Nations, where we are subjected to frequent charges of exploitation.15. As regards this last point, it is doubtful whether a change of title would lead to any respite from abuse at the United Nations or elsewhere. France, witha &quot; Ministry of France Overseas &quot; and Holland, with a &quot; Ministry of overseas territories,&quot; are, we believe, no less subject to charges of exploitation. Indeed,the very making of a change might be made the subject of a specially virulentattack such as, for example, that we were showing typical British hypocrisy in attempting to disguise our colonial exploitation by a change of name.16. Even if the title of the Secretary of State and of his Department werechanged, we think that it would still be necessary to describe as Colonies those territories which are now so described, and also to speak of &quot; the Colonial Service.&quot;The word &quot; Colony &quot; has a statutory meaning under the Interpretation Act, 1889,and it has been used in numerous Acts of Parliament. It is difficult to think ofany word which could be substituted for &quot; Colony &quot; in this connection, while achange in the title of the Colonial Service would, moreover, be unwelcome to members of that Service and might have an adverse effect on morale and recruiting.17. It would, however, be possible, while still speaking of &quot; Colonies &quot; and&quot; the Colonial Service &quot; to change the title of the Colonial Secretary and his department, thus meeting in part the first two objections cited in paragraph 14.The only alternatives which we can suggest are &quot; Secretary of State for overseas territories&quot; and &quot; Department for Overseas Territories.&quot; But besides beingcolourless expressions, these are so wide as to be somewhat misleading and wecannot recommend them.18. Finally, we would think that, in view of the discussions now taking placeabout the constitution of the British Commonwealth, the King&apos;s Title and british nationality, it would probably be unwise at this moment to make a change in the title of the Colonial Secretary or the Colonial Office.III.-Inter-Departmental Agency Arrangements19.   Finally, we have considered whether there is room for improvement inthe arrangement whereby the Commonwealth Relations Office and Foreign office have access to the special knowledge and experience of the Colonial Office on questions of overseas administration.20.   It is the practice of the Territorial Department of the commonwealth relations Office, which deals with the High Commission Territories, to consult* Of the 38 Administrations responsible to the Colonial Office, 23 are Colonies, 4 are combinationsof a Colony and a Protectorate, 2 are combinations of a Colony, a Protectorate and a Trust Territory,2 are combinations of a Colony and Protected States, 5 are Protectorates, 1 is a Trust Territory and1 (the Western Pacific) includes 2 Colonies, a Protectorate, a Protected State, and 2 Condominiawith other Powers.36847 b 2
the Colonial Office and their various advisers and Advisory Committees on alladministrative problems effecting these Territories which need consideration in. thelight of general colonial practice. For this purpose there is a free interchange of files and minutes.between the Departments, and, in general, it may be said thatthe Territorial Department of the Commonwealth Relations Office is in very much the same position as a Geographical Department in the Colonial Office.21. The following arrangements may be mentioned as instances of this general practice: (a) Copies of all Colonial Office circular despatches and telegrams to colonial governments are sent to the Commonwealth Relations Office and areforwarded automatically to the High Commissioner for Basutoland,the Beehuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, except where clearly not applicable.(6) When it is necessary to recruit an officer in this country for service in the territories the matter is referred to the Appointments Banch of \heColonial Office with a view to the selection of an officer. Of recentyears the Resident Commissioners of the Territories have all been selected, in consultation with the Colonial Office, from the colonial service. Conversely, officers in the Territories are considered by theColonial Office for appointments in other Colonies when suitablevacancies occur.(c) As the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office have acommon Legal Adviser, all Proclamations of any importance issued bythe High Commissioner are considered by the Legal Adviser in thelight of Colonial precedents. Some Proclamations are also referredto the appropriate specialist Departments of the Colonial Office.(d) Reports and despatches from the Territories relating to the variedtechnical aspects of administration educational, medical, agricul-tural, veterinary, &amp;c. are referred to the respective Colonial OfficeAdvisers for such advice as may be necessary.In appropriate cases matters arising in the Territories are con-sidered by the relevant Colonial, Office Advisory Committee (e.g., theAdvisory Committee on Education in the Colonies or the ColonialSocial Science Research Council). The Colonial Office WelfareDepartment also assist in looking after natives from the Territorieswho come to this Country.(e) Applications from the Territories for assistance under the colonial development and Welfare Act are referred for examination to theappropriate Colonial Office Department who, subject to the agreementof the Commonwealth Relations Office, submit them to the treasury in the same way as other Colonial schemes.(/) The Crown Agents for the Colonies act for the Territories in the same way as for other Colonial Governments.22. The Foreign Office have not hitherto found it necessary to call on theadvice of the Colonial Office to the same extent, but the need may well arise forclose consultation between the two Departments, particularly on questions arisingfrom the administration of the ex-Italian Colonies. The Colonial Office haveassured us that, within the limitation imposed by shortage of staff, they are readyto make their services available to the Foreign Office in the same way as to theCommonwealth Relations Office. We regard this assurance and the intention ofthe three Departments to keep their arrangements for agency services and mutual assistance under review as satisfactory and have no specific recommendations tomake.IV. Summary of Recommendations*23. -(i) No changes should be made in the present allocation of responsibilityfor overseas territories, with the exception mentioned in paragraph 5 that ifEritrea and Italian Somaliland are to remain in British hands for more than ashort period it will be necessary to examine the arrangements for their admin-istration.(ii) The only alternative title which we can suggest for the Secretary of Stateand his Department would be &quot; Secretary of State for Overseas Territories &quot; and
department for Overseas Territories.&quot; But we do not regard this as a satis-.factory alternative and think that it would be undesirable to make a change atthe present time.(iii) We have noted the existing arrangements for enabling other Depart-ments to take advantage of the Colonial Office&apos;s specialist knowledge and experi-ence of overseas administration, and we recommend that these arrangements should, where necessary, be extended.(Signed)     E.
