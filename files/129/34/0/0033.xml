&quot;If/if *k$U,&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49)105 COPY NO..9TH MAY. 1949CABINETTHE MEAT ration memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Pood1.     When I reported to the Cabinet on 18th April on the meatsituation (CM. (49)27th Conclusions, Minute 3), I said that Iwould circulate a further report after Easter, when it would be necessary  to decide what ration could be maintained in theimmediate future.2,     Canned corned moat is cur ultimate reserve of meat and myDepartment has tried to enter each calendar year with a stock of80,000 tons to cover all emergencies.    We were, however, obligedto issue two pennyworth for 28 weeks in 1948 to maintain the totalmeat ration at l/-f and to issue six pennyworth for 2 weeksduring the dock strike in July.    In consequence our stocks at theend of 1948 had run down to 66,000 tons.    The issue of twopennyworth of canned corned meat has continued in 1949, and stocks at the end of April were only 31,000 tons.    If issues arecontinued at that rate stocks of canned corned meat are likelyto be down to 6,000 tons by the end of July.    This figure takesno account of possible arrivals from Argentina from May to July,but even under the most favourable conditions we could not hope to get more than another 5,000 tons of canned corned meat fromthat source.3.      On the other hand, -prospects for carcase meat supplies arerather more promising than they were when CP. (49)84 was circulated.Argentina has so far continued to ship at a modest rate, and we expect about 40,000 tons to.arrive from that source during april and May.    In addition, the Argentine Meat Board apparently intendsthat loading shall continue until some date in June, and thereare signs of great reluctance to face any interruption.   We expect to receive at least a further 10,000 tons during June, but obviouslyuntil a new agreement is made there must be complete uncertainty about the prospect for arrivals in later months.    We have in thesefigures written off as a total loss some 3,3 50 tons which were onboard the &quot;Magdalena&quot;.    (There is some hope of salvaging some ofthis meat but it will not reach here for many months).    Finalauthority for the purchase of 30,000 tons of United States porkhas now been received from S.C.A. and we are starting to buy.    we hope to arrange that at least 20,000 tons arrives in this countryin May and June and the balance before the end of July,4,      On this basis, and allowing for - the maintenance of thecarcase meat ration at its present level of lid,  (equivalent to8d. at&apos; the prices ruling up to 23rd April) we estimate that our stocks of ration meat would be as follows:-TonsEnd May 79,000End June 88,000End July 90,000End August 109,000

These figures would &quot;be increased by the amount- of any rationmeat shipped from Argentina after 14th May,5.      It is therefore clear that there will be no need to takethe exceedingly grave step, which we feared so much might&quot;become inevitable, of cutting the ration &quot;by another 2d.    Onthe contrary, the above figures make it possible to increasethe carcase meat ration by 2d. to the eauivalent of lOd. atthe old prices . (l/ld. at the new prices)&quot;, and I think weshould do this.    This will give us the following stock figures:-6.      There remains the&apos; question whether or not we should,when we increase the carcase meat ration &quot;by 2d,, cease toissue the present two pennyworth of canned corned meat.    Iam extremely reluctant to do this, since all the evidenceshows that the public deeply, and most justifiably, dislikesand suffers from a total meat ration of undor 1/- (at the oldprices).7.      On the other hand,  it is most important that we should begin the calendar year 1950 with adequate stocks of carcase andcanned meat combined.   We shall have good supplies of home-killed meat from early August onwards, &quot;but this cannot bestored, and the extent to which our low carcase meat stockscan be built up during the autumn to use during the leanperiod in the early months of next year depends upon the levelof imports during the second half of this year.    This againdepends mainly upon the rate of shipment from Argentina.    Theonly other possibility of meat supplies is to buy furtherfrozen pork from the United States.    There will be plenty ofthis available and the price has fallen considerably.    But ofcourse it costs dollars.    Since we have no certainty that therewill not be a complete break in the Argentine shipmentslasting some months if negotiations break down, I feelcompelled to recommend that v/e hold on for the time being toour canned corned meat stocks, which means ceasing to issuecanned corned meat on the ration at the same time as v/eincrease.by 2d. the carcase meat portion of the ration.    Ipropose that wo should do both on Sunday, 22nd May.End MayEnd June end JulyEnd AugustTons72,00067,00053,00058,000J.S.Ministry of Food,Montague House, S.W.1,9TH MAY,  1949.
