HONG KONG

Report by the Chiefs of Staff

The Defence Committee, at their meeting on 27th April, 1949 (D.O. (49) 12th Meeting), when discussing our recommendation on the reinforcements that should now be sent to Hong Kong, invited us to prepare a fresh appreciation of the extent of the threat that was likely to develop against Hong Kong.

2. Our report is attached and is divided into two parts - Annex I, the threat to Hong Kong and Annex II, the defence of Hong Kong. A War Office note on the anti-aircraft defence of the Colony is attached as Annex III.

3. Our conclusions are as follows:-

(a) If we show our determination to hold the Colony there is little likelihood of a direct Communist attack on Hong Kong.

(b) The garrison, reinforced to the strength shown below, would be strong enough to hold local or guerilla attacks; moreover, its presence would show our determination to hold the Colony and should thus deter the Communists from open hostilities:-

Navy: Far Eastern squadron augmented by local patrol craft to be manned from the cruisers on station.

Army: Two infantry brigades

One armoured squadron

Two field regiments

One composite A.A. regiment Ancillary administrative units.

Air Force: One fighter/ground attack squadron of 16 aircraft Fighter control and early warning radar Five Sunderland flying boats.

(c) In order to bring the garrison of Hong Kong up to the strength given above, the following military action is now required (in addition to the despatch of the fighter squadron, the battalion and the brigade headquarters ordered to Hong Kong last week):-

(i) To send to Hong Kong as early as possible the remainder of the brigade group, namely -

Two infantry battalions

One armoured squadron

One field regiment

One composite A.A. regiment.

(ii) To augment the fighter squadron now being sent to Hong Kong from 8 to 16 Unit equipment aircraft.

(iii) To bring forward and arm additional local patrol craft.

ANNEX I

THE THREAT TO HONG KONG

Present Situation

A communist Army group has crossed the Yangtze and in now operating against Shanghai. Two further Communist Army groups, totalling some 700,000 men, are in a position to advance into South China.

2. The Chinese Nationalist Army facing this force numbers some 150,000 men but its morale is virtually non-existent and it does not constitute an effective fighting force.

3. The Chinese Nationalist Government has withdrawn from Nanking and is established at Canton but has largely ceased to exercise control over its territory or its forces.

Future Developments.

4. It now seems more than ever certain that a Communist regime will be established throughout the Chinese mainland and it may not even be necessary for the Chinese Communist Army to continue military operations to achieve this end. In the event, however, of the Nationalist Government re-establishing resistance to the Communists in the South, or if the Communists decide that it is necessary to eliminate the British Colony of Hong Kong, we consider that the military possibilities are as follows:-

(a) Owing to the poor state of the roads and the Communist Army&apos;s lack of motor transport, the Communists would rely for their advance mainly upon the Hankow - Canton Railway.

(b) Allowing time for the collection of rolling stock, and assuming that the amount of rolling stock on the line is the same as in March 1948 and that the Nationalist Forces have not carried out demolitions, we consider that the maximum rate of movement from the Hankow area to Canton and the vicinity of Hong Kong would be as follows:

50,000 men with stores and guns 10 days

100,000 men with stores and guns 15 days

200,000 men with stores and guns 25 days

Further forces could be added to the above if they were thought to be necessary. Over and above any forces advancing from the Yangtze area, there are in South China some 80,000 Communist Forces, formerly guerrillas, but who are now organised on the same lines as the main Communist Armies.

Likelihood of an Attack on Hong Kong

5. Any strong Chinese Central Government is likely, in the long run, to desire to terminate the British occupation of Hong Kong. In the early future, however , a stable British regime in Hong Kong may well be considered to be useful to a new Communist Government, as an economic link with the outside world. For some time, moreover, the Communist Government, coming into power after prolonged civil war, is likely to be occupied with internal affairs. Unless the Communist Government, therefore were to be


tempted by nationalistic ambitions, or alternatively by the possibility of an early conquest, to risk hostilities against the United Kingdom, it seems unlikely that they will undertake an attack upon Hong Kong for some time. Evidence of the British intention to resist any attack on Hong Kong would considerably reduce the likelihood of the Communists deciding to attack the Colony. In any case, they will probably at least make an attempt to obtain its rendition by negotiation before resorting to force.

6. Since, however, the possibility of an early attack on Hong Kong cannot be ruled out entirely, we have estimated below its possible scale and nature.

POSSIBLE SCALE AND NATURE OF ATTACK

Internal Threat

7. The threat of internal unrest in Hong Kong always exists and could be implemented by the Communists in co-ordination with an armed attack from outside. The Hong Kong Trade Unions are likely under these circumstances to take orders from the Communist authorities in China: the police force may become unreliable; and the Chinese element in the Volunteer Forces may be disaffected. Should, therefore, the Communists decide to attack the Colony, labour unrest, strikes, demonstrations and mutiny are to be expected. It appears possible that the Communists in Hong Kong may not wait for the armed assistance of the Chinese Communist Army from the North, but may be instructed to cause a revolutionary situation in the Colony by the means mentioned above and this may well be assisted by the 80,000 Communists irregulars in the area.

8. Should it be possible for the Communists to make any sea or air attacks on the Colony, their effect on the morale of the Hong Kong Chinese might be temporarily, at any rate, very serious. Such attacks would further greatly encourage internal strikes by Communist controlled Unions.

9. As a result of the Communist advance to the South the garrison of the Colony would have to contend with the internal security problem created by an attempted large scale influx of refugees.

Land Threat

10. Although the Communists will have available a land force of the size described in paragraph 4 above, they would not be able to deploy all these forces against Hong Kong. The landward threat would be limited by the narrowness and difficulties of the approaches to the frontier defences. We are unable to assess accurately the size of force that could be employed without local knowledge of the ground, but we consider that it might amount to the equivalent of 2-3 divisions. In addition, there would undoubtedly be an attempt to land forces in various parts of the Colony by sea. Large numbers of sampans will be available in the Canton River and Mire Bay and may well be employed in trying to land troops on the Island of Hong Kong and behind the defence line in the New Territories. Recent evidence shows that the Communist Army have managed successfully to collect and man large numbers of local craft for river crossings elsewhere.

11. The present Chinese Communist Armies bear no resemblance to any previous Chinese Army. Their morals, discipline and standard of training is of a high order. The Communist Commanders have also shown that they


possess sound tactical principles and are able to execute complex plans. Their ? includes a high proportion of automatic weapons and artillery up to 105 mm. Their equipment in general is mainly of Japanese and American origin. The amount they possess has undoubtedly increased as a result of recent fighting, since it is reported that a large percentage of the Nationalist Forces have either defected or abandoned their arms, most of which are probably American ?. Their tanks are few, old and small. They have virtually no motor transport.

Air Threat

12. Although it has been known for some time that the Communists have been training on old Japanese aircraft, up to the present they have not made any use of aircraft in operations. It is known that they have obtained some aircraft by defection from Nationalist Forces and 21 aircraft comprising 3 Liberators, 5 Mustangs, 2 Mitchells and 11 Dakotas have been identified. There may be other aircraft not at present identified. There will also undoubtedly be many others left behind by the Nationalists in an unserviceable condition. Some of these might be made serviceable provided sufficient maintenance personal could be made available from captured Nationalist troops or civil air companies.

13. The Communists have at present no operational air experience and the morale of those Nationalist aircrews who have defected is low and they are most unlikely to be prepared to press home any attack in the face of any opposition. In view of this, any air threat to the Colony is likely to be short lived, badly conceived and lacking in determination.

14. We do not believe that there is likely to be any further appreciable defection from the Nationalist Air Force but should a peace be arranged, the transfer of the Nationalist Air Forces at present in Formosa would undoubtedly be one of the conditions imposed by the Communists. This might bring some further 450 modern aircraft under Communist control. But unless the Communists are reinforced by Russian personnel, which we consider to be most unlikely at present, the standard of operational technique would remain low and determination to press home the attack would be lacking.

Naval Threat

15. At the time of the crossing of the Yangtze, the Nationalist Navy consisted of the following ships:-

6 Destroyers

4 Destroyer Escorts

12 Escort Vessels

11 Minesweepers

3 Patrol Boats

12 Submarine Chasers

Some 37 Landing Craft

Some of these are ex-Japanese and were turned over disarmed. A few have been re-armed by the Nationalists and there is nothing to stop the Communists continuing this process.


16. It is known that one ex-Japanese destroyer and probably also ? vessels have surrendered to the Communists. A further four destroyer escorts manned is ? from the United State to China, but it is not known what ? they are likely to take.

17. ? of ? vessel listed above will have been sunk ? in the recent fighting but for any attack on Hong Kong a proportion must be expected to take part, having either surrendered or been captured. The Communists will, however, be incapable of operating those vessels together efficiently or of organising any amphibious operation on Western lines.


- in paragraph. 5 of Annex I we have stated that for political and economic reasons the Communists may very wellaecide not to attack Hong Kong in the early future overt should they quickly overrun the South of china;    aid that formilitary reasons they are unlikely to attack the Colony if itis clear to them that it will ae strongly defended?  There is*nevertheless, a possibility of an organised attack being madeon Hong Kong by the Chinese Communist Army if we do not showour determination to defend it,2.       In Maroh,19h7 it was decided  that Hong Kong would not he defended in war against a major power in occupation of theChinese mainland.   We consider that the effectiveness- af theChinese Communist Government is not such that, even if the communists control the whole of China, it could he classed asa major power.    We therefore consider that Kong Kong couldbe held, unless we are engaged in a war with Russia.3V    Hang Kong, like Berlin, may well become the stage for atrial of strength between Communism and ths vie stern Powers.If the Chlntiao Communist Government were able to force our withdrawal from ttie Colony, the blow to our predtigathroughout the world would be irreparable and there would benoriOtis reporcussions on tho efforto now being made againstCommunism in the Far Bast.h.    Our aim rahould therefore be to hold Hong Kong againstChinese Communist aggrossion even if Communist China declareswar on Great Britain*The Defence of Horn? Kong5.    We examine below the method of defending Hong Kong and.ie forces required,6.     The defence must he ablo to deal with the followingthreats simultaneouslyt-(a) internal unrest, probably sponsored by Communistinspired trade unions;(b) a large scale Influx of refugees in numbers beyondthe capacity of the Colony to absorb;(o)   external aggression.7.     Tho Communists would have large numbers of troops available for an attack against tho Colony, and could provideconsiderable artillery support.   Such nn attack would, however,have thu following limitations(a)   air support would, in thu foreseeable future,still bo lacking;+  D0(46) 7th Meeting
(b) the number of troops which could be effectively deployed across the boundary of the Leased Territories would be limited by the narrowness of the front and the poor communications leading to it;

(c) the enemy&apos;s troops would be less well-trained and organised than ours. They lack armour and mechanical transport; their equipment is unbalanced, and their artillery technique is only moderate.

8. There would be an additional threat of seaborne infiltration by sampan and junk around the long sea coast of the Colony and the Leased Territories. Although such an attack could be supported by those ships of the Chinese Nationalist Navy which had defected to the Communists, there in no likelihood of a Chinese navy making any effective attempt in the presence of the Far Eastern Squadron.

9. The tasks of the garrison would be to:-

(a) hold a line in the Leased Territories;

(b) counter seaborne landings;

(e) exploit our command of the air;

(d) maintain internal security.

10. Land Defence. We consider that if the attack given in Annex I, paragraph 10 (2-3 divisions) were mounted, we could hold the line from Tolo Harbour to Deep Bay with one division backed by adequate air support.

To meet local or guerilla attacks, one brigade group (including one armoured regiment and two field regiments) would be adequate, in addition to the brigade group for internal security.

11. Seaborne Landings. The threat might consist of large numbers of junks and sampans landing parties of infantry in widely dispersed areas. The Far Eastern Squadron, including naval manned local patrol craft, if assisted by air reconnaisance, could prevent any effective seaborne assault. Nevertheless, troops would be required to mop up such small parties which might succeed in getting ashore. We consider that this task could be performed by mobile columns from the brigade employed on maintaining internal security.

12. Air Defence. We consider that to meet sporadic air attack, one fighter squadron of 8 aircraft with fighter control and early warning radar is essential: one composite AA regiment is also required. It is most important for the morale of the local population that air attacks should be effectively countered.


MS13*     Air Supngrt.   In addition, aircraft are required tosupport tho land Joraoo, to attack jjunko and sampans, and fornoa ruoonnaioounce.The squadron at present planned for reinforcement shouldbe increased in strength to 16 aircraft, and the, allowinge aircraft for air defence, would provide 8 aircraft for airsupports   The remaining fighter squadron in Malaya couldreinforce Kong Kong ut short notice, and in emergency thelight bomber squadron from Singapore could also be sent toHung Kong.The five flying boats at present at Hong Kong willbe adequate for sea reconnaissance.If further air support is required, a light fleetcarrier could reach Hong Kong from the Mediterranean in some three weeks..   Due to the limited capacity of Kal Tak, naval aircraft would in the main have to be carrier operated:   if thecarrier was required to operate Tor more than three monthsserious logistic complications would ariseslit.      Internal security, we consider that one infantry brigade,.;ith the assistance of the battalion of the Hong KongVolunteer Defence Force now forming, would be adequate tomaintain internal security in Kowloon and Hong Kong and toprovide mobile columns to deal with seaborne Infiltration.   If,however, the attack was prolonged and the situation dwfcwJoi-tttioa,it might be necessary to reinforce these troops by up to one infantry brigade.Forces Required15.      We conclude from the above that the following garrisonvould be strong enough to hold local or guerilla attacks for aconsiderable period.   Moreover, its presence would show our determination to hold tho Colony and should thus deter the communists from open hostilities..Navy - The ffuv Eastern Squadron au mented by localpatrol craft manned from tho cruisers on the station.Army - Two infantry brigadesOne armoured regimentTwo field regimentsOne composite aa regimentAncillary administrative unitsAir   - One fighter/ground attack squadron of 16 airoraftForce . Fighter control and early warning radar&apos; 5 3underla.ua flying boats
16. If, however, an attack by some 2-3 divisions were mounted, the garrison would need considerable reinforcement. The Internal security problems would increase in accordance with the external attack and our success in holding it. Reinforcement of the following order might be required

Navy - One aircraft one division of frigates

Army - One division

Air Force - One fighter squadron

One fighter bomber squadron

These squadrons could be increased from 8 to 16 ? aircraft each

The implications of providing reinforcements of this magnitude will clearly require very careful examination. For example, the mobilisation of the units or the division would require the call up of part of Section B of the Army Reserve in addition to section A, and the provision of the necessary shipping would have wide repercussions.

Action Required Now

17. The present British garrison consists of one infantry brigade group, including one field regiment, and five Sunderland flying boats. Naval support is provided by ships of the Far Far East Squadron.

18. The Commanders-in-Chief, Far East, have recommended that the garrison ought now to be reinforced to bring it up to the strength shown in paragraph 15 above. They have, therefore, decided to despatch one fighter squadron of 8 aircraft from Malaya to Hong Kong. One ACP flight of 5 aircraft is also earmarked in Malaya to move there if required.

It is presumed that the Commanders-in-Chief, Far East, will move fighter control and early warning radar from Malaya to Hong Kong.

The necessary army reinforcements, amounting to one composite AA regiment and one infantry brigade group, with one field regiment and one armoured regiment, cannot be found from within the Far East theatre.

19. The Defence Committee recommended the all the army reinforcement referred to above, except for the armoured regiment which would be replaced by one squadron only, should be sent as soon as possible.

20. The Cabinet have agreed that a brigade headquarters and one battalion should be sent at once, and that preparations should be made for sending the remainder of the brigade group as soon as practicable.

21. The further military action required is, therefore:-

(a) To send to Hong Kong as early as possible the remainder of the brigade group, namely two infantry battalions, one armoured regiment, one field regiment and one composite AA regiment.

ANNEX III

AIR DEFENCE OF HONG KONG

Note by the War Office

Introduction

The Commanders in Chief Far East consider that there is an urgent requirement for the early arrival in Hong Kong of one composite AA regiment of two heavy batteries and one light battery.

Threat of Air Attack

2. Recent estimates that though the Communist Forces have so far made no use of aircraft in operations they have been training for some time an old Japanese aircraft and at present they are also known to have obtained some aircraft by defection from the Nationalist Forces. These consist of some 16 assorted bombers and 5 fighters though this count is incomplete and there may be other aircraft not at present identified.

There will also undoubtedly be other aircraft left behind by the Nationalists as the Communists advance, some of which may be made serviceable.

3. The Communists have at present no operational air experience and the morale of those Nationalist aircrews who have defected is low.

In view of this, any air threat to the Colony is likely to be of poor operational standard and lacking in determination.

4. Should a peace be arranged the transfer of the Nationalist Air Forces at present in Formosa may well be one of the conditions imposed by the Communists. This might bring some further 450 modern aircraft under Communist control. It is still considered however that determination to press home an attack would be lacking.

AA Defence

5. There are at present NO AA defences in Hong Kong and in spite of the poor quality of any possible threat it is considered that some AA defence should be provided for three main reasons.

(a) To maintain the morale of the population of the Colony, particularly the Chinese element.

(b) As a deterrent to an attack.

(c) To ensure that if an attack is made it meets with opposition likely to increase any lack of determination to press the attack home, and to prevent further attacks.

6. To provide an AA force capable of giving efficient all round AA defence to Hong Kong would mean sending some two AA Regiments at least and this would be out of proportion to


the threat in view of our limited resources.     On the otherhand It would be unsound to send too small a token force which.In the event of an attack, would, be quite ineffective andmight well have the affect of raising the morale of theattackers.CONCLUSIONft    It ia therefore considered, that, since the Commandersin Chief Far East have stressed the need for AA defences forHong Kong and for the reasons given in paragraph 5 above, anAA forts should be sent to Hong Kong as a matter of urgency.It is further considered that while this fores shouldbe in proportion to the threat it should also be as efficientas possible and should therefore consist of one compositeAA Regiment of two HAA batteries and one LAA/SL battery allennipped with the best equipment available for their task,and with the necessary ancillary units,SBOOMMKNDATION,8,    We recommend that the Defence Committee should agreeto tho despatch of one ooraposite AA Regiment and ancillaryunits to Hong Kong aa soon as it can be formed.
