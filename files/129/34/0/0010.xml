DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8  GOVERNMENT 0(JtHISPrinted for the Cabinet. , A-pril, 1949CONFIDENTIALGdpy No. O31CP. (40) SO6th April, 1949CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO,JUNE-JULY 1948ORGANISATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT service memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. In CP. (48) 209 I circulated an account of the 31st Session of theInternational Labour Conference held at San Francisco from June to July 1948.The present paper contains my proposals as to the action to be taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Convention and Recommendation con-cerning the organisation of me employment service which were adopted at that conference, The texts of the Convention and Recommendation were published in Cmd. 7638. .. -Convention No. 882. The Convention (No. 88) concerning the^organisation of the employment service requires ratifying States to maintain or ensure the maintenance of a freepublic employment service. It contains provision as to the principles whichshould govern the operation of such a service and as to its structure and duties.These principles are already fully applied in the operation of the public employ-ment service in the United Kingdom and no fresh legislation will be involvedin formally accepting them. I therefore, propose that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should ratify this Convention.Recommendation No. 833. The Recommendation (No. 83) concerning the organisation of the employ -ment service supplements the Convention and goes into greater detail in regardto the matters dealt with by the Convention. It is acceptable with one smallreservation on a point in paragraph 12. That paragraph relates to the referralof workers to employment and reads as follows :-&quot;12.   The employment service should &quot; (a) observe strict neutrality in the case of employment availablein an establishment where there is a labour dispute affecting such employment;&quot; (6) not refer workers to employment in respect of which thewages or conditions of work fall below the standard defined by law orprevailing practice; H&quot;(c) not, in referring workers to employment, itself discriminate against applicants on grounds of race, colour, sex or belief.&quot;4. With regard to sub-paragraph (a), our policy in dealing with this typeof vacancy is well-tried, and understood and accepted by both sides of industry.It has recently been reaffirmed in Section 2 (5) of the Employment and TrainingAct, 1948, which states that &quot;No person shall be disqualified or otherwiseprejudiced . . . . on account of his refusal to accept employment found for himthrough an Exchange if the ground of his refusal is that a trade dispute which..      36851
affects his trade exists or that the wages offered are lower than those current in thetrade in the district where the employment is found.&quot; This enables us to accept(a) of paragraph 12 without qualification, and we can also accept (c).5. With regard to sub-paragraph (b), the instructions under which theEmployment Exchanges work are that, when a vacancy is notified the conditionsof which appear in some manner to contravene the law, they should give the employer the opportunity to clarify the matter or to remove the offending con-dition. If this fails, no steps are taken to fill the vacancy. This enables us toaccept (b) of paragraph 12 so far as it relates to standards defined by law.So far, however, as it relates to standards falling below &quot; prevailing-practice,&quot; it would be quite impracticable to have a rule that the EmploymentExchanges should never submit a worker to a job in these circumstances. Itwould presuppose that it is practicable, for every job, to define what is the&apos;&apos; prevailing practice &apos;&apos; not only on wages but on conditions of work. It wouldmean that we might have to refuse to accept vacancies where the wages and con-ditions are full in accordance with the law and do not clearly contravene any trade Union agreement. It would mean further that, even at a time of high unemployment, we must allow a worker to remain unemployed rather than assist them by submitting him to a job which he would like to take even though the con-ditions appear to be inferior to &quot;prevailing practice &quot; whatever that phrasemay mean. We must clearly make some reservation on this point, but the rulequoted in paragraph 4 above ensures that a worker shall not be prejudiced by refusing to accept a job with wages below those current.6. The United Kingdom Government delegate at the 31st Session of theInternational Labour Conference, when he voted in favour of the adoption ofthis Recommendation, made it clear that Article 12 was not regarded as in every respect satisfactory by the United Kingdom, and that in voting for the Recom-mendation His Majesty&apos;s Government did not commit itself to accepting its everydetail.7. My proposal is, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should acceptthe Recommendation, but in so doing should make a reservation in respect ofthat part of Paragraph 12 (b) to which reference is made above.Issue of White Paper8. On the basis of the above proposals I now seek authority for the issueof a White Paper in the form of the draft which is annexed to this paper, setting out the Government^ decision in regard to the Convention and Recommendation.9. I am putting forward separately (CP. (49) 81) proposals concerningConvention No. 87 on Freedom of Association .and Protection of the Right toOrganise. In regard to the remaining two Conventions adopted at the 31stSession of the Conference I shall be submitting proposals at a later date.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W&apos;. 1,Qth April, 1949.Draft White PaperINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCEThere is set out below the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on theConvention (No. 88) and the Recommendation (No. 83) concerning the organisa-tion of the employment service adopted by the International Labour Conferenceat its 31st Session in 1948, which it is proposed to communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office. The French and English texts ofthese instruments were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 7638.Convention (No. 88) Concerning the Organisation of the Employment ServiceStates which ratify this Convention are required to maintain or ensure themaintenance of a free public employment service. The Convention containsdetailed provisions as to the duties and structure of such a service and lays
down certain broad principles by which its service shall be guided in its opera-tions. The organisation of the public employment service in the United Kingdomaccords with the provision of the Convention and His Majesty&apos;s government therefore propose to ratify it.Recommendation (No. 83) Concerning the Organisation of the Employment Service &apos;This recommendation supplements International Labour Convention No. 88and defines in greater detail than the Convention the methods and principlesby which the free public employment service shall be organised. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, with one reservation relating to paragraph 12, subscribe to theprovisions of this Recommendation.Paragraph 12 of the Recommendation, which relates to the referral ofworkers to employment, lays down inter alia that the service should observe strictneutrality in the case of employment available in an establishment where thereis a labour dispute affecting such employment and that it should not referworkers to employment in respect of which the wages or conditions of workfall below the standard defined by law or prevailing practice. In regard to thesetypes of vacancy the policy of His Majesty s Government is defined in Section 2(5)of the Employment and Training Act, 1948, which provides that &quot; no person shall be disqualified or otherwise prejudiced on account of his refusal to acceptemployment found for him through an exchange if the ground of his refusal isthat a trade dispute which affects his trade exists or that the wages offered are lower than those current in the trade in the district where the employment isfound.&quot; With regard to vacancies whose conditions appear to contravene thelaw, the instructions under which the Employment Exchanges work are that an employer notifying such a vacancy should be given the opportunity of clarifyingthe matter or of removing the offending conditions. If this is not done no steps are taken to fill the vacancy. These arrangements are in full accordance with paragraph 12 of the Recommendation. With regard to vacancies where thewages or conditions are below the prevailing practice, however, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are satisfied that it would be administratively impracticable toensure that submissions are not made in such cases and that the existing rule that a worker shall not be prejudiced by refusing to accept such vacancies is adequate.   It is accordingly proposed to make a reservation on this point.Apart from this one reservation on Paragraph 12, His Majesty&apos;s government propose to accept the Recommendation.
