THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1949SECRET Copy No.   31CP. (49) 868th April, 1949CABINETREMUNERATION OF MEMBERS OF NEW TOWN CORPORATIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 5th April (L.P. (49) 9th Meeting, Minute 2) the lord presidents Committee were unable to reach agreement on the question whetherordinary members of New Town Corporations should be remunerated. I was asked to circulate a paper to the Cabinet stating the arguments on both sides, andthe possible alternative courses.2. Eleven New Town Corporations are at present in being in England and scotland. In accordance with the New Towns Act, 1946, each Corporation consists of a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and not more than seven other members. their remuneration is determined by the Minister of Town and Country Planning orthe Secretary of State for Scotland, as the case may be, with the consent of theTreasury. With a few exceptions, where payment has been declined, Chairmenreceive  1,500 a year, Vice-Chairmen  1,000, and ordinary members  400. Itis estimated that the work Of an ordinary member, including preparation for meetings, takes on an average something of the order of one day or so a week.3. The Lord Presidents Committee agreed that, whatever decision might be arrived at as to the future, no change should be made in the terms of serviceof existing members during the currency of their present appointment. It wasalso suggested that, if this was practicable, arrangements should be made forany change to a voluntary system to take place when all the members of a particularCorporation came up for reappointment rather than piecemeal as individualvacancies occurred.4. We agreed that if it was decided that these appointments should cease to be paid, there should be provision for expenses and loss of remunerative ,timecomparable to that in force for members of local authorities.5.   In favour of the voluntary system it is argued: (a) Everything possible should be done to maintain the principle of voluntarypublic service, and to avoid the multiplication of paid appointmentsat the disposal of the Government. There has been no difficulty in getting competent people to serve without pay as Chairmen of regional hospital Boards and Hospital Management Committees, notwith-standing the heavy burdens involved; and appointments to New TownCorporations can be distinguished from appointments to the boards of socialised industries because the latter are highly commercialundertakings.(b) Whether or not the Corporations are strictly analogous with localauthorities, the comparison is in fact made, and there are distinctsimilarities between their work and that of local authorities in majorhousing and reconstruction developments; as an alternative to a NewTown, it is, for example, proposed that the Manchester City council should develop a new estate for about 25,000 people at Mobberley.In some areas members of local authorities feel that it is wrong thatcouncillors who serve on New Town Corporations should be paid for what seems to them essentially similar work, which is unpaid whendone by a local authority. It is also relevant that ultimately the corporations will hand the New Towns over to local authorities.(c) There is every reason to expect that, once the planning stage is over, theburden on the ordinary member of a Corporation will decline.36866
6.   In favour of payment it is argued : (a) The analogy with the local authorities is false, if only because, except to the extent that they are drawn from local authorities, members ofNew Town Corporations have not sought election to a public authority.Not only do most of them expect remuneration, but in the absence of remuneration it will not be possible to get people of the right qualifica-tions. This is particularly true of professional and business men,whose experience it is especially valuable to have. In some casessuitable people of this type could not afford the financial loss whichunpaid service on a Corporation would involve, but, even where thisis not so, they are accustomed to be paid for their work, and paymenthelps them to justify to their partners and associates the time whichthey are devoting to service on the Corporation.(&amp;) As far as remuneration is concerned, the Corporations should not beconsidered in isolation from the public Boards, whose part-time members are not only paid, but paid more than the ordinary membersof the Corporations. The Socialisation of Industries Committee haveexpressed the general view that  500 a year should normally be theamount paid to a part-time member of a socialised Board, but thereare various exceptions where salaries up to  1,000 have been authorised.(e) Contrary to the view stated in 5 (c) above, the burden on the ordinarymember is likely to increase as the plans for the New Towns are givenpractical effect.7. One suggestion which was made in the discussion was that, as an experi-ment, future Corporations should be appointed on an unpaid basis, except forthe Chairman and Vice-Chairman. This would show whether there was any real difficulty in getting people to serve without pay, and whether the systemworked well.8. Another possibility would be to reduce the remuneration to, say,  250 ayear, but some of our colleagues take the view that this would do little to meetthe arguments for changing to a voluntary system, and the Minister of Townand Country Planning and the Secretary of State for Scotland feel strongly that,when account is taken of the responsibilities of members of New Town Corpora-tions and of the remuneration of part-time members of public boards, the present rates are by no means out of proportion.9.   There are, I think, four courses open to the Cabinet: -(a) To leave things as they are.(b) To decide to change to unpaid appointments when all or most of theordinary members of a Corporation come up for reappointment.(c) To ask the Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to make the experiment of appointing futureCorporations on an unpaid basis, except for the Chairman and Vice-Chairman.(d) To reduce the payments.10. There remains one outstanding point, the decision on which may, tosome extent, depend on the view which is taken by the Cabinet on the main issue.The Working Party which was set up at the instance of the Lord presidents committee to go into this question recommended that the&apos; remuneration paid toVice-Chairmen should be reduced from  1,000 to  600 a year on the ground that,except when the Chairman is absent, his work is more in line with that of ordinary members than with that of the Chairman. The Working Partyconsidered, therefore, that, while he should be paid more than the members, thedifference need only be relatively small. The Minister of Town and country planning thinks, however, that the Working Party underestimated the Vice-Chairman^ responsibilities, and, while he would prefer to make no change, thatthe Vice-Chairman should be paid at least  750.H.
