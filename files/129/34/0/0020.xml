8ECBET &apos;       \ .     -    &apos;^.CotW&quot;Ko.o-&quot; - \ &quot; - -- ---        ----- ... - hi     .19i&amp; April, 18-19 , &apos;..,   &apos;,   .WAR ClIMSS: THE G2SMAH GENERALSMemorandum-bs- the Secretary of State for War      - -   -   -AT their meeting on SIst March (CM. (49) 24th Conclusions, Minute 2), thsCabinet took the view, after seeing repasts of a medical board composed, of-Army doctors and of medical officers of the British prison service, that it was undesirable for the Government to decide the question whether Field-Marshal voaRundstedt and Colonel-General Strauss were fit to stand trial and invited meto ascertain whether it would be practicable for the war crimes court to consideras a preliminary issue whether these two officers were fit to stand their trial and, if the answer was in the affirmative, to take the necessary steps to have thatissue put to the court at an early- date.&quot;8. I have examined this question with my legal advisers and the LordChancellor and it is clear that it would not be within the powers of a. war-crimes court, set up under the Boyal Warrant of 14th June, 1845, to determineas an issue the question of physical fitness to stand trial. The Royal Warrantprovides that, except&apos;in so far as therein otherwise provided expressly, or by implication, the provisions of the Army Act and the Rules of procedure relatingto Meld General Courts-Martial and to any matters preliminary, or incidentalthereto or consequential thereon shall apply, so far as applicable, to military courts set up under these regulations as if the Military Courts were Field GeneralCourts-Martial and the accused were persons subject to military law chargedwith having committed offences on active service. This was in accordance withthe decision of the Government at the time.3. A Field General Court-Martial has no power under the Army Act andRules of Procedure to decide the issue of physical fitness to stand trial. It has power to accept or reject a plea of unfitness to plead on account of insanityin accordance with general United Kingdom practice (S.130 (1) of the Army Actand Rule of Procedure 57), but that is a different matter.4. Under present practice the convening officer (in this case the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, B.A.O.R.) is given a medical certificate that the accused is fit to stand trial before he orders the court to be assembled, and whenthe court is assembled the prosecuting officer has to hand in to the court &apos;&amp;certificate of fitness at the opening of *sell day of the-: trial. In the absence ofa medical certificate of fitness the convening officer would not take steps to put the accused on trial. It would fee within his power to order the court to be assembled without such a certificate and, if the accused were fit by the time thecourt assentMedrths trial could proceed on the prosecution furnishing the requiredmedical certificate each day, but in ths present case the enect would merely be. that the prosecution would be unable to give the required certificates of fitnessand the court, having no power to determine the issue, could only report to the convening officer that they were unable to proceed. The responsibility would thus be thrown back on the convening officer.5. I do not think that it would be fair to throw on the General OfficerCemmanding-in-Chief, B.A.O.B., the responsibility for deciding on the strengthof the medical certificates that the two officers will neve? bo fit to stand trial
and that the prosecutions should therefore be finally abandoned, apart from thefact that he would not normally be aoked-to assemble the ceart until the prepara-tion of the case for the prosecution is complete and ready to go to trial.6. It would, in theory, be possible to amend the Royal Warrant of 14th June,1945; to.give a Military Court express power to determine the issue, whether,the accused is physically unfit to stand his trial, but I see the strongest objectionsto doing so. There would, in fact, be no issue to determine if both prevention and defence had only evidence of unhtness to produce. In any case, the courtcould only reach a decision on the medical evidence submitted.-to them.as&apos; tothe fitness of the accused to stand trial at the time, and this would still leavethe responsibility on the convening officer to consider fresh medical reports fromtime to time and assemble another court to consider the question of fitness if and when he thought this warranted. The effect of bringing the issue beforethe court in a case like the present might also be extremely embarrassing froma political and international point of view. The prosecution would be bound, Iconsider, to put before the court the medical reports they have which show thatthe accused are unfit and the defence, knowing this, might conceivably take theline that the accused, conscious of their innocence, are willing and anxious to stand their trial and that it is the prosecution after making tneir charges whoare reluctant to proceed. If such a situation were to arise, it would obviouslyplace the court in a most invidious position.7. In any case, I feel that the objections to placing the responsibility for determing fitness on a court composed.of British military officers or on theGeneral Officer *Commanding-in-Chief, B.A.O.R., are at least as great as theobjections the Cabinet felt to placing the responsibility on His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. There have already been suggestions in certain quarters that the delay in bringing these officers to triad was due to reluctance on the part of the militaryauthorities, and I cannot think that the decision of a British Military Court will carry more weight with the Russian or Polish Government than a decision byHis..Majesty&apos;s Government.8. I feel strongly in these circumstances that the proper course is for theGovernment to accept the responsibility of making a decision and to meet any criticism which the decision arouses.9. In accordance with the Cabinefs decision we are proceeding in the mean-time, as speedily as possible, with the preparations for the trial of Field-Marshalvon Manstein.The War Office,19th April, 1949.
