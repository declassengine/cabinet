Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1949SECRETCP. (49) 7328th March, 1949CABINETWAR CRIMES: THE GERMAN GENERALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for war at their meeting on 5th July, 1948 (CM. (48) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3),the Cabinet invited me to take immediate steps to collect evidence and makeany other necessary preparations for the trial of Field-Marshals von Brauchitsch,von Rundstedt, and von Manstein and Colonel General Strauss, on the under-standing that the question of trying Field-Marshal von Brauchitsch might bere considered if, after the evidence against him had been collected;, it were foundthat he was still unfit to stand trial. At that time a Home Office Board of experienced prison medical officers had reported that Field-Marshal vonBrauchitsch was not fit to be brought to trial but that the other three were fit.2. Following the Cabinet decision, the four Generals were sent back to;Germany and steps were taken to prepare the case against them with all prac-ticable speed. This has involved a great deal of research and^enquiry in washington, in this country and in Germany. Field-Marshal von Brauchitschdied from a heart attack on 18th October, 1948, and since then efforts havebeen concentrated on the charges against the other three. They were given astatement of the charges against them, subject to possible further alteration,on 31st December, 1948, and preparations for the settling of the indictments andthe serving of documents on the accused are now well advanced. I had, however,received very disquieting reports from the military medical authorities about the health of von Rundstedt and Strauss, from which it appeared likely that neither of these two officers would, in fact, ever be fit to be brought to trial and, therefore,that the efforts being made to collect evidence and prepare cases against them would prove to have been largely wasted. I accordingly arranged recently withthe Home Secretary, after consulting the Foreign Secretary, the Attorney-Generaland the Lord Chancellor, to have a fresh medical examination of the three Generalsby a joint Board of two experienced medical officers of the prison service andtwo Army doctors to determine their present and probable future fitness to stand trial. Their reports just received, which are unanimous, conclude asfollows : Rundstedt. We are of opinion thati he is unfit to stand his trial as a resultof enfeeblement of mental function due to senile changes andcongestive heart failure.Strauss. Taking into consideration his highly emotional state and theevidence of progressive and extensive coronary disease shown inserial electrocardiograms during the past year, we are of opinionthat he is unfit to undergo a prolonged trial of the durationenvisaged, namely 6-8 weeks.Manstein.- We are of opinion that he is fit to stand his trial, and thathe will remain fit to instruct his Defence Counsel- during such atrial, also to give evidence if he wishes, be cross-examined and followproceedings in court. We do not consider that there is any seriousprobability that he will collapse or break down under the strainof trial.The reports are given in full in Appendix A.36791 * copy No.   3 J
It is, in my opinion, clear from these reports that von Rundstedt and Straussare not fit, and never will be fit, to stand trial, but Manstein is fit and there isno reason, from the health point of view, why he should not be tried.3. If these findings are accepted, as I think they must be, and it is agreedthat Rundstedt and Strauss should not be tried, it is obviously desirable thatwe should spend no further effort on finishing the preparation of the eases against them, and that we should concentrate our efforts on Manstein if it is agreedthat the enforced dropping of the cases against the other two is no reason foraltering the previous decision in his case.I should be glad to know whether my colleagues are prepared to accept the findings of the medical Board, and whether they agree that no further steps should be taken to try Rundstedt or Strauss.4. As regards proceeding against Manstein alone, I think it should berealised that the whole case against him relates to the East. (Incidentally, this applies also to Strauss.) There is nothing whatever against him in the West.The case against him is a strong one and a bad one but we are not directly interested at all. It is the Russians and the Poles who have suffered and in thisconnection it has to be borne in mind that the crimes and atrocities committed by the Wehrmacht on Polish soil against Polish nationals during the period in question took place while Manstein Was Chief of Staff to Rundstedt and, inthe absence of Rundstedt being tried with him, he may be able to plead thathe was not entirely responsible. This is a point which will have to be consideredby counsel if it is agreed that we are to proceed with the trial of Manstein. should it be decided that no count is to be launched against Manstein in respect ofPoland, the Polish Government will have to be informed that no further steps&apos;should be taken by them for the collection of evidence on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the trial. This point does not arise in the case of the crimesand atrocities in Russia, of which the U.S.S.R. have a long list to bring againstManstein.5. I should also mention that on 15th February last the Ministry for Foreign* Affairs of the U.S.S.R. presented a note to our Embassy in Moscow in which theyrehearsed the crimes and atrocities alleged against Manstein, Rundstedt andStrauss on Soviet territory, and demanded that all three of them should be handedover to the Soviet authorities for trial in accordance with the Three-power declaration of October 1943 and the resolution of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations Organisation on 13th February, 1946, that war criminalsresponsible for or participating voluntarily in such crimes should be arrested and &apos;&apos; sent to the countries which were the scene of their abominable actions for trial and punishment in accordance with the laws of those countries.&quot;6. The Foreign Secretary was proposing to reply to this demand by pointing out that we were committed to the trial of the Generals by the British militaryauthorities, and that they were accused of acts committed in territories outsidethe Russian frontiers and could not reasonably be tried successively by all countrieswhich have a case against them. If, however, the charges against Mansteinrelating to Poland have now to be dropped, and the case against him remainspurely a Russian one, it may be difficult to maintain a refusal to surrender him tothe Russians for trial. It may also be difficult, if we decide not to proceed againstRundstedt and Strauss on health grounds, to refuse the Russian demand thatthese officers should be handed over to them for such action as they might thinkappropriate. This is, however, a question for the Foreign Secretary to adviseupon.7. If the trial of Manstein is to proceed, I think it will be possible totake the necessary steps to get the indictments settled by counsel and documentsserved on the accused within the next few weeks, although there is still a consider-able amount of work to be done. Manstein&apos;s case is the lengthiest and gravestof the three, but there is a great volume of evidence available against him. It is,however, important that we should know definitely at the earliest possible momentwhether his trial by us is to proceed. Even after the documents are served it willbe necessary to allow the defence a reasonable period, say up to two months if theyask for it, to enable the defence to be prepared.8. The work already done oh the preparation of the case against Rundstedtwill not be all wasted since at the trial of Manstein much of the evidence against
Rundstedt will be required for the purpose of cross-examination, as Rundstedtwillpresumably be a key wiiness for the defence of M^steinj, at least for a partof the period, and, some of the evidence may also be useful as an attack on the credit of Rundstedt in certain circumstances. , s   : ,i ft,&apos;  I ask the Cabinet to decide:- &apos;(a) Whether they accept the findings of the medical Board and aaree. ihatall further&apos; proceedings against Rundstedt and Strauss should bfr. abandoned t .. ..... ^ . ; A . ,(6) If so, whether it is agreed that we should proceed with the trial ofManstein alone. &apos;El S.The War Office, S.W.1,28th March, 1949.APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;Hamburg, B.A.O.R. 3,^. 11*A March, 1949.Director of Army Legal Services,The War Office,London, S.W.1.Subject: Medical Examinations.Ex-Field-Marshal v. Runijstedt.Ex-Field-Marshal v. Manstein:Ex-Colonel-General Strauss.( ,. In accordance with-instructions contained in WTCtJ/troops/8 dated 4th March;1949, we, the Board so constituted, visited 94th (Hamburg) British MilitaryHospital on 10th March, 1949, and examined the accused.All available records of previous medical examinations and investigationscarried out since the date of their capture were placed at our disposal forThe result of bur examinations and our opinions set forth in accordance withthe terms of reference given to us in memo, of even reference dated 26th February,1949, are submitted herewith. .    ,(Signed) J. BENNET, Brigadier.W. HARGREAVES, Lieut.-Colonel.J. C. M. MATHESON,H. K. SNELL.Examination of ex-Field-Makshal von RundstedtA frail man showing marked sigh of degeneration physically and mentally.We are informed by his medical officer in charge that he gets up at about 11 a.m.daily and is able to stay up until about 9 p.m. Also that he spends his timereading and talking to his wife.At bur examination we saw ho signs of reading matter in his room. although he stated that his interests were more active now than a year ago we were never-theless impressed by his apathetic attitude throughout the whole examination.His only complaint was of pain in the right nip. His thought processes wereslow and his apprehension poor, and in general his conversation betrayed childishtraits. These indicated to us that senile mental changes had taken place andwere progressing. This impression was in keeping with our findings on physicalexamination.Hie shows atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues and evidence ofgeneralised cardio-vascular degeneration.   On examination there is no cardiacenlargement found clinically nor radiologically, the radial arteries are thickenedahd tortuous.  The pulse is 70, regular blood pressure 150/80 mm. Hg. and the36791 b 2
retinal vessels show well marked arterio sclerotic changes. There was oedemaover the lower third of the tibia and around the ankles and a few crepitationsat the bases of the lungs. It is relevant that at the examination on the2nd March, 1949, no oedema was detected, whereas our finding indicated that con-gestive heart failure was still present. Examination of the urine showed a moderate amount of albumen and of white and red blood cells, which findingis consistent with this condition. Rectal examination revealed slight firm enlarge-ment of the prostate. Repeated blood urea estimations had been normal. Therewas clinically and radiologically evidence of marked osteo-arthritic change in theright hip.We, the Board, are of opinion that he is unfit to stand his trial as a resultof enfeeblement of mental function due to senile changes and congestive heartfailure.(Signed) J. BENNET, Brigadier.W. HARGREAVES, Lieut-Colonel.J. C. M. MATHESON.H. K. SNELL.Examination of ex Colonel-General StraussThis accused is up all day, exercises outside freely and devotes time indoorsto reading.On examination he showed senile changes but not out of keeping with hisage. He was apprehensive throughout, tremulous and over-eager to co-operate,giving an impression of having poor emotional control and being in a state ofchronic anxiety. His main complaint was of a feeling of oppression in theprecordium and of occasional pain at this site and radiating to the upper partof the left arm. His sleep is disturbed by a need to pass water and attacks ofbreathlessness. The latter usually occur in the early hours of the morning andhe states that they are relieved by sitting up.Examination of the cardie-vascular system showed that the heart is notenlarged. Radiologically the cardiac silhouette is distorted as a result of dorsalscoliosis to the right. The heart sounds are weak and the second aortic sound is relatively accentuated. The peripheral arteries are tortuous, the pulse rate 108and the blood pressure 150/90 mm. Hg.Serial electrocardiograms dating from 24th March, 1948, when the recordwas within normal limits, show changes consistent with coronary occlusion ofTl type with left bundle branch block in records of 31st September, 1948, and1st December, 1948. In the records of 8th February, 1949 and 2nd March, 1949,there are further changes indicating arborisation block.Apart from the cardiac condition and prostatic enlargement nothingabnormal is found in any other system. The urine shows no abnormality onroutine and microscopic examination.We, the Board, taking into consideration his highly emotional state andthe evidence of progressive and extensive coronary disease shown in serial electro-cardiograms during the past year, are of opinion that he is unfit to undergo a prolonged trial of the duration envisaged in the terms of reference given forour guidance, namely six-eight weeks.(Signed) J. BENNET, Brigadier:W. HARGREAVES, Lieut.-Colonel.J. C. M. MATHESON.H. K. SNELL.Examination of ex Field-Marshal von MansteinAn active alert man looking a little older than his reputed 61 years. He is up and about every day and we have been informed by his medical officer in charge thathe leads an active life within the limits obtaining.On examination we found him alert and co-operative. His conversation isrational and relevant. He complains of defective vision, some difficulty in sleepingand slight frequency in passing water at night.
He is somewhat obese and flabby. His cardio vascular system revealed nothingabnormal. Pulse was 72, regular, blood pressure 120/70 mm. Hg. He showedsign of previous tonsillar inf ection---an enlargement oi the left tonsillar gland-but no signs of of present active infection. Apart from the disability incidental to his long standing eye condition we found the accused to be well. No evidenceof renal impairment was found.We, the Board, are of opinion that he is fit to stand his trial, and that hewill remain fit to instruct his Defence Counsel during such a trial, also to give evidence if he wishes, be cross-examined and follow proceedings in court. Wedo not consider that there is any serious probability that he will collapse orbreak down under the strain of trial.(Signed) J. BENNET, Brigadier.   -W. HARGREAVES, Lieut.-Colonel.J. C. M. MATHESON.H. K. SNELL.
