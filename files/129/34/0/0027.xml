SHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (k10) 973RD ;may 1 9^9CABINETWAR CRIMES;    THE GERMAN GENERALSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor at their meeting on 28th April, 19/4.9 (C. M. (Z4.9) 30thConclusions, Minute 3), the Cabinet asked me to hear evidence,with the assistance- of the Lav/ Officers and a medical assessoror assessors, from the doctors who were in a position toexpress a view on the question whether Field-Marshal vonRundstedt and Colonel-General Strauss were physically fit to stand trial, and to make recommendations.2. I asked Professor Sir Henry Cohen, Professor ofMedicine at Liverpool University, to sit with us and on Monday,2nd May, I sat with the Attorney-General and Professor Cohen to hear the evidence.     We interviewed the two Home Office doctors and the two War Office doctors who together constituted theJoint Medical Board which had reported on 11th March, 19/4.9, onthe fitness.of the German Generals to stand trial, and we alsointerviewed the medical officers in whose care the Generalshave been in Germany, one of whom had made a report which seemed to conflict with the view of the Medical Board.3* After hearing all the. evidence and. examining theelectrocardiograms and X-ray films which were produced we cameunanimously to the following conclusions:-(i)    Field-Marshal von Rundstedt.      He is sufferingfrom congestive cardiac failure which is now kept under control by digoxin (a digitalis derivative).      His expectation-tation of life, if subjected to no undue strain, would bre from three to four years.      If, however, he were subjected to the strain of a trial which must in all likelihood lastfrom six to eight weeks there v/ould be a probability of are currence of severe congestive cax^diac failure whichwould lead to sudden death during the trial.It is relevant to say that the prison doctor inGermany who recently made a report which differed from thereports of the Joint Medical Board told us that he nowconsiders Field-Marshal von Rundstedt unfit to stand trial.His explanation of his change of opinion was that in giving his first opinion he did not know, the criteriainvolved in fitness to stand trial.      He expressed hisopinion that the Field-Marshal would not survive the strain of a long trial.. We agree with the unanimous opinion of the doctorsthat the Field-Marshal is unfit to stand trial by reasonof his physical condition.COPY NO.

We do not base our conclusion on reports of hismental degeneration, as we do not think this is so serious as to render him unfit to plead, although he wouldprobably be incapable of the prolonged concentration andsound judgment which would be&quot;needed for his defence.(ii)   Colonel-General Strauss.     His expectation of life, if subjected to no undue strain, would be eighteen months to two years, though he might die at any time.His electrocardiogram which was produced shows that the .condition of his heart is very serious.      Professor Cohen,on seeing this electrocardiogram, expressed his agreementwith the doctors that he is unfit to stand trial.   &quot;(iii)   Field-Marshal von Manstein.     The doctors areunanimously of the opinion that this man is fit to standtrial.In this opinion Professor Cohen concurred, and&apos;the Attorney-General and I see no reason why this manshould not be put on his trial.4. I am told by those responsible at the War Office that.Field-Marshal von Manstein&apos;s indictment is almost ready and itis hoped that the papers will be served on him within the nextfew days.5. I have considered, with the Attorney-General, whetherit would be better for the decision not to try Field-Marshalvon Rundstedt and Colonel-General Strauss on medical grounds tobe made by the Cabinet or by the Military Court after hearing the medical evidence.      For the reasons given by the Secretaryof State for War in his memorandum (CP. (49) 90) of 19th April,we   advise that the responsibility for this decision should betaken by the Cabinet.6. Finally, I S(ge the Cabinet&apos;s authority to make knownto the House of Lords during the debate which is to take placeon Thursday, 5th May, on the Bishojj of Chichester&apos;s Motionthe decision of the Cabinet and the fact that this was reached on the strength of a report which I made to the Cabinet inwhich the Attorney-General and Professor Cohen concurred.J.House of Lords, S. W. 1.3RD&apos; MAY, 1949.
