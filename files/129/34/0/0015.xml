this  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MJLJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  A pril 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy^ No. 3 1CP. (49) 8511th April, 1949CABINET3SICKNESS ABSENCE IN INDUSTRY AND RATES OF national insurance BENEFITMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service on 9th December, 1948 (CM. (48) 79th Conclusions, Minute 6), the cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Minister of National Insurance, to consider and report whether the increase in the rates of sickness benefit in July 1948 had resulted in any increase of absenteeism in industry.2. In order to obtain information on sickness absences in industry myDepartment invited a number of important firms and organisations believed tobe keeping tabulated sickness absence records to supply a statement indicating how the amount of sickness absence in each month of 1948 compared with the amountfor the corresponding month in 1947 and if possible in 1946. As a result of this invitation a considerable volume of statistical information was obtained fromImperial Chemical Industries relating to the sickness experience of over 70,000workpeople and from twenty-nine other undertakings relating to some 140,000workpeople in a wide variety of industries. Similar information relating to some35,000 workpeople in Royal Ordnance Factories has also been considered.3. While caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions from statistics of sickness absences, which are subject to many variable influences, examination of theresults of the enquiry shows that (1) In each of the years 1946, 1947 and 1948 there was a marked seasonalvariation in the rates of sickness absences which were highest inJanuary or February and lowest in June, July or August in each year.(2) The seasonal variations did not show any abnormality which could notfairly be associated with climatic and epidemic variations and the factthat the principal cause of sickness absences is the colds, influenza, &amp;o,group of diseases.(3) In particular, the seasonal change of trend of sickness absence in themiddle of 1948 was not so abrupt and the autumnal rise was not somarked as to justify their association with any particular cause orevent.(4) An exception to conclusions (2) and (3) above must be made in respect of sickness absences from the Royal Ordnance Factories in the last four months of 1948. During that period, the absences were some one andthree-quarter times as great as would have been the case if they hadconformed to the normal seasonal increase which took place in the other undertakings covered by the enquiry. This exceptional increaseappears to be associated with the introduction, on 1st September, 1948,of a scheme of sickness leave with pay for Government industrialemployees; and it may be relevant to observe that LCI. (Limited) insubmitting their figures for the last three years report that the figuresfor absences of staff grade workers, who receive wages during sickness,are considerably greater than those for non-staff grade workers, who arenot paid wages during sickness.36865
4. It would seem to be a reasonable inference from the information obtainedthat the increase in July 1948 in the rates of sickness benefit under the national insurance scheme did not result in any significant increase in the amount of sickness absence in manufacturing industry.5. Further information about the effect of the introduction of the industrial injuries Scheme in the coal-mining industry is being collected by the Ministry ofNational Insurance in conjunction with the National Coal Board, but it will be some time before this is available.6.   The Minister of National Insurance concurs in this note.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1,11th April, 1949.
