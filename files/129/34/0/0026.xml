J.. 139-US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.CABINETPOLICE CONDITIONS OP SERVICE - FIRST REPOPTOF THE OAKSEY committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and the Secretary of Statefor scotland we have received the first Report of Lord Oaksey&apos;sCommittee on Police Conditions of Service.      It has been presented to Parliament and was published on 25th April(Cmd.   (67k.).      The Report is unanimous and it deals with all themain subjects within the Committee&apos;s terms of reference thatinvolve additional expenditure.2. The major recommendations on pay are summarised in the annex to this memorandum.      The Committee recommend for con-stables, sergeants and inspectors new scales of pay which willgive most men in those ranks an increase of about 21s. Od a week with a variation between 17s.Od and 26b. 6d a week according tothe point that the individual has reached on the present-incremental scale.     For policewomen the increases are propor-tionately less.      For the higher ranks the Committee suggest no increase in the maxima, but some improvements at the minima ofthe scales that were accepted by the Government last year for england and Wales.      On 15th March, 1948, (C. M. (k&amp;) 22ndConclusions, Minute k) the Cabinet agreed that the introductionof these scales for superintendents and Chief Constables shouldbe temporarily deferred in pursuance of the policy embodied inthe White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd.  7321).3. The cost in the first year of introducing the scalesrecommended by the Committee is estimated at about  k millions,of which half would fall on the local rates and half on theExchequer.k. The Committee also recommend minor improvements insubsistence and lodging allowances, compensation for overtime&apos; and in widows1 pensions -aad children&apos;s allowances.    The proposed increases in widows&apos; and 6hildi?cn&apos;s benefits are from  30 to 50 a year for a constable&apos;s widow and fro:.i 5o*5d. to 6s.6d.a week for a constable&apos;s child, with proportionately smallerincreases for the higher ranks.5. The Committee couple their recommendations for improved conditions with the recommendation that in futurepension should be based upon the average pay received during thelast three years of service instead of, as at present, theactual rate of pay at the time of retirement.      This recommen-dation is put forward on its merits as a permanent feature ofpolice conditions but it may be expected to have the valuableeffect for the next three years of slowing down the rate ofresignations amongst men who have served long enough to retireon pension.SEC RET C.P. (k10) 962ND MAY,  1949

6. The Committee. recommend explicitly that the increasedscales of pay for all&apos;ranks should be introduced as soon aspossible.      In a paragraph which discusses the possible effectof the policy, described in the White Paper they report as&apos;, follows:-&quot;(a) A strong and efficient police service is necessaryfor the well-being of the -community to a greaterdegree than any other public service in peace time;(b) The police service in England, and Wales as a whole, is. - seriously undermanned and this is particularly true&apos;of the important forces of the Metropolis and the --large cities; ,      &apos;: . !(c) There has been a change in the nature.of police duty.and a change in the social and economic environmentin which it is performed;(d) Many other occupations.have been given increased wages since the publication of the White Paper andthe considerations that Warranted those increasesmust apply with equal, if not greater,/force to the&apos;    police;(e) The introduction of increased scales of pay should help.to reduce the deficiencies in police establish-ments and there can be little doubt that failure tointroduce improvements would have a most harmfuleffect; - .      ,(f) It would not be possible without having a disturbingeffect upon the contentment of the service to treatany part particular rank or. ranks preferentially.In our view, the foregoing factors demand a reassessment ofthe value of. the police in terms of remuneration, and thefact that we were appointed to carry but our enquiry afterthe publication of the White Paper encourages us to believethat proposals for increased pay would&apos;not &quot;&quot;be regarded asnecessarily inconsistent with its principles.   - Our scalesare certainly not put forward&apos;merely &apos;on the basis of main-taining a former relativity&apos; with other- occupations but are intended to comply with the terms of the White Paper which states that  &apos;each claim&apos; for an increase in wages or salariesmust be considered on its national merits.&apos;&quot; ,1. - &apos; The state of recruitment of the police forces is farfrom satisfactory and establishments.,, particularly in Londonand the large provincial cities,  are dangerously low.      As theOaksey Committee point out, the main difficulty is not so muchrecruitment - though recruitment has. fallen off seriously in thelast few months - as the retention of men who have gained some experience and are still young enough to be the officers on whosephysical and mental alertness the efficiency of the force must depend.      The Committee also point out that resignations wouldhave been even more numerous in 1948 but for the fact that many men are awaiting the outcome of their deliberations before deciding whether to leave or ,not.      In these&apos; circumstances weare convinced that it is essential in the public interest that effect should be /yjven to the recommendations contained in theReport at the&quot;earliest possTble date.     This- involves the sub-rnission of draft Regulations to the Police Councils-and, in thecase of alterations to the Pensions Code, affirmative resolu-tions in both Houses of Parliament.      Meetings of the PoliceCouncils have been summoned for 18th May in England and 19th Mayin Scotland.

- 141o, v/e have represented these views to the&apos;Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and have in particular stressed the fact that theReport, which contains a closely integrated series   of recommen-dations, must stand or fall as a whole.      The Chancellor has indicated his general acceptance of the view that, the need toget the police, force on to a sufficiently satisfactory footingis so great that it may be necessary tp accept the main recommen-. datlons, but we agree with him that the matter is of such,importance that it should be reported to and discussed with theCabinet and Government policy should be settled before we embark on discussions with the Police Councils.   .  The Chancellor has,however, felt it necessary -to make reservations on two of theCommittee &apos;s recommendations , namely, the proposed improvement-sin widows&apos; pensions&quot; and the introduction of improved scales of pay for Chief Constables. . *9. &apos;   On the first of these two points the Chancellor has expressed the view that to give police widow/s improved benefitswithout a substantial&quot;additional contribution from, the policemen&quot;themselves would be embarrassing in relation to the proposed scheme for the ;,rmed Forces and the proposals for the CivilService now before Parliament.     We have very carefully con-sidered this point but we are convinced that to withhold these benefits would have the most deplorable effect on the police    .service and would indeed produce a feeling of bitterness whichmight well destroy the beneficial results which we hope toobtain from the adoption of the Report as a whole.     The questionof widows&apos;benefits is one on which the police are particularlysensitive;   they have been pressing for improvements through thePolice Federation for many years and the failure of successive governments to meet their demands has produced a feeling ofbitterness and frustration out of all proportion to the intrinsicvalue of the amounts at issue. .    Members of the House are well aware of this, and when1 police pensions legislation was intro-duced last year Ministers were strongly pressed on this point;the pressure would have been much stronger had it not been forthe appointment of the Oaksey Committee.      In shpri: this is oneof those sentimental issues which count in the men&apos;s minds to an extent quite disproportionate to its intrinsic merits.10. Further, we think it possible to over-estimate thedanger of repercussions from the police to other services.Police conditions are far removed from those both of theFighting Services and of the Civil Service and this has been recognised in other fields.      The contributions of members ofthe Fighting Services under the National Insurance scheme, forinstance, have been reduced below those payable by the police;we understand that one reason for this was that the members ofthe Fighting Services were, before the introduction of the scheme,entitled to pay.during sickness and free medical benefits, thoughthe fact that their contributions had been so reduced v/as takeninto account,  in the post-war revision ,of pay, in the comparisonwith outside remuneration on vmich Fighting Service pay is based.In effect, therefore, the soldier pays the full contributionthough in a different way.    . The police were also entitled topay during sickness and free medical benefits but they got no corresponding relief from their- contributions when they were brought under the National Insurance scheme.      Under theproposals for the Civil Service, children&apos;s allowances may bepaid so long as the children are undergoing full-time education;the police (whose children allowances terminate at the age of16 years)  asked for a similar concession but, after.consultationwith the Treasury, it was refused.      Further - and this was themain reason which impelled the Committee to recommend the increases - the police pensions scheme is a contributory.one and widows&apos; and children&apos;s benefits are the only ones ?/hxchhave been- at flat rates and are not assessed as a proportion of pay.      The Committee point out that it is difficult to justifythe maintenance of these basic awards at the 1921 level not-withstanding the increases that have, taken place since then in

2ND MAY.  19U9.J. C. E.A. W.pay and. therefore in pension contributions and this is. the main reason for their recommendation.      The Committee do not regard the minor adjustments in widows&apos; pensions and children&apos;allowances which they recommend as an adequate improvement.    Intheir view the case for an increase has been proved but they recommend that any substantial improvement beyond the adjustmentsrecommended should be in return for additional^ contributions.In these circumstances we earnestly hope that our colleagues will agree that this recommendation must be accepted.11. As regards the new scales of&apos; pay for Chief Constablesthe Chancellor has suggested that Chief Constables should be   .treated similarly to the higher- ranks of the Civil Service,i.e. that the improved scales should be introduced gradually as   ;from the date taken for the introduction of the increases recommended by the Chorley Committee.      This would result in amost embarrassing position&apos;as regards the Chief Constables inEngland and Wales.      Improved scales of pay which do not differ -except at the minimum - from those recommended by the OakseyCommittee were agreed by a committee appointed by the HomeSecretary which included representatives of the Chief Constables,:of the English local authority associations and of the HomeOffice before the issue of the White Paper on Personal incomes,but effect could.not be given to them because one of the localauthority associations declined to honour the agreement and the resulting, discussions were not completed before&apos; the White paper was issued.      On that occasion representatives of the Chief,Constables v/ere received by the Pr;Lme Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Home Secretary, the situation was   ,explained to them and they accepted it.      It was, however, con-templa+ed that the postponement of the improvements v/ould be for .a matter of months only;    in later discussions with the chief constables -it was recognised that they had an&apos;outstanding claim which had been granted in principle but; that, effect could&apos;not begiven to it while the pay of the lower ranks was the subject of investigation, notwithstanding the position that their claim wasin reality associated in time with the previous advances givento-their subordinates.      If the improved scales recommended bythe Oaksey Committee are given to the ranks below Chief Con-stable , as in our view they must be, we should be at a loss tofind.grounds to submit to the Chief Constables of England andWales for withholding from them still further this tardy imple-mehtation of claims we have already accepted.     There was nosimilar pre-Oaksey Committee on the pay of Scottish chief constables but these officers have long been pressing for a revision of their salaries and, like their colleagues in Englandand Wales, they will expect immediate implementation of the scales recommended by the Oaksey Committee.      On the other hand,some at least of the Scottish police authorities will be strongly opposed to the scales. ,12. The Report as a whole is a moderate document and indeed it is bound to be received by the police with some dis-appointment.      The police cannot go to arbitration.     They,haveno Whitley Council and they are debarred, from industrial courts and other such bodies whose findings, even when we dislike them,we have accepted since the publication of the White Paper on personal Incomes.      The Committee was appointed by us and the.police were not consulted as to its composition;    if we pick andchoose amongst its findings we shall create lasting irritationand there will be a continuation of the smouldering discontentwhich is the principal cause of the resignations which are ourgreatest problem.      We are sure that public opinion does not regard the Committee&apos;s recommendations as over-generous and wewould earnestly appeal to our colleagues to agree that effect .may be given to the Report as a whole as from 1st July next, theearliest date by which the necessary Statutory Instruments couldbe made.
