IX 0it 0ANFEXOCCUPATION STATUTE AND TRIPARTITE control agreement ,l.     Qr,i.g:Ui^f-&amp;b,gse- instrumentsOccupation Statute.     The Germans asked for a legalinstrument defining the powers of the Occupying Authoritiesand it was, therefore, resolved to draw up an occupation statute.Tripartite Control Agreement.     The Americans insisted on an agreement defining those issues on which unanimity was required and those on which a majority vote would decide.They also wished to perpetuate the &quot;weighted vote&quot; (preponderantUnited States vote) which they now enjoy in the Joint export and Import Agency under the British-United States FusionAgreement.1 &apos; Finally they v/ished to provide for TripartiteCommissions in each Land, a proposal which we resisted asunnecessary and unpractical.2.     P,Qsit-.i.on before the l/Vas,hlagto,n government &amp;iagOccupation Statute.     After two months Three-Powerhard negotiation Agreement was reached in London on a textembodying the safeguards which each country wished to insert.Our princix)al requirements were power - to secure payment ofoccupation costs, to recover.sterling expenditure incurred on behalf of Germany.,  to prevent   unfair trade practices,to make the dependants of allied forces justiciable inBritish courts and to protect foreign nationals fromdiscrimination in German courts.     When these and&quot; all theother Allied safeguards had been inserted the documentpresented a somewhat formidable appearance.Tripartite Control Agreement.      On the issue ofunanimity and majority voting no insuperable difficultyairose.     But the negotiations broke down on &quot;weighted voting&quot;.-The Americans claimed a preponderant vote on all issues whichthey deemed might affect the American appropriation for germany.      Under such a formula they might have claimed tobe the arbiters in almost .every field of legislation, e.g.nationalisation, social security, -wages and prices, etc. etc.There was also disagreement over the proposal to haveTripartite Commissions at Land level,3.     Present PositionOccupation Statute.      The Americans have represented that the agreed Statute is so complicated and restrictive asto make a-German Government unworkable.      They have accordinglytabled a new simplified draft,   the text of which is containedin Washington telegram No. I898.Tripartite Control ii.greement.     Here, instead of anagreement,  the Americans have tabled a new draft of &quot;principles&quot;,the text of which is contained in Washington telegram No. *2027.

U. &apos;   The. Points at issueOccupation Statute.     The main advantages of theAmerican draft are:-(q) It is a much simpler document of more pleasingappearance and,  taken with the &quot;principles&quot;, is designedto give the Germans a greater degree of liberty.(b) The Americans and the French (surprisingly) are determined to have it.      Consequently it seems only on thebasis of the American draft- that we can reach the agreement which is essential to the early establishment- of a GermanGovernment,The main disadvantages are:-(i) It is not the legal instrument, for which theGermans asked (and omits provision, for a High Court to interpret the Statute).(ii) Unlike the old draft,  it does not provide for compulsory review after 18 months. &apos;   This is a minorobjection.(iii) It- does not include  the safeguards to which we attach importance;    though our delegation have undertaken to try tohave these inserted (see Washington telegram No.  2003).Tripartite Control Agreement.     The principles laiddown in the new American draft- have three quite new main features: -. (a) The Germans are to have the maximum liberty,  the conception of Military Government is to&apos; disappear and allied control,  except in security matters, will be graduallyliquidated.     With, this general principle we have no quarrel.(b) All aid to Germany will foe channelled throughJtJvCA.&apos;    United States interests will be protected by a bilateral - agreement and the ugly problem of weighted votingseems thus disposed of.      But there is a risk thet in orderto meet German requirements under this scheme aid to other european countries may be chiselled.(c) The functions of the allied authorities shall be divided, Governmental functions being exercised by high commissioners and military functions by Commanders-in-Chief,as soon as a German Government- is established.     The ideaof putting in civilians is attractive,,particularly since it means liquidating Generals Clay and Koenig.     &quot;But thereare obvious dangers and object-ions to-this course, which wehave not adopted in Austria.     So long as war with Russia ispossible and the local situotion in Berlin remains criticalprompt action in an emergency can best be taken by a man whocombines in himself the functions of civilian and military authority.      The same applies in a lesser degree to the handling of the many issues raised by the presence in germany of occupation troops (accommodation,   training areas, incidentswith Germans and, most important, security and maintenanceof public order).     Finally there is the less importantadministrative problem arising from the fact that- our civilians in Germany depend for -everything on the Array.

5* &apos; . Qfifiolusions1, The intentions behind the.American initiative arepraiseworthy.     In view of the attitude of the American andFrench representatives, it seems that agreement on the basisof the American drafts offers the only chance of quicklyestablishing a German Government.2. The most import-ant issues to be weighed are:(c.) The omission of some of our principal requirements from the Occupation Statute and the uncertainty regarding their re-insertion.(b) The proposal to channel all aid to Germany through(c) The proposal to appoint civilian High Commissioners.Foreign Office, .S.W. l4,7th April, 1949.
