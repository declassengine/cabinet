CUTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49) -102QTH MAY. 1949CABINETLOCAL government memorandum by the Minister of Town and country planning in CP. (49) 82 the Minister of Health states the case for a Royal Commission on Local Government in England and wales and in CP. (49) &quot;101 the Lord President sets out the reasons which lead him to the view that procedure by way of a RoyalCommission would be undesirable.On general grounds and in the light of my experienceof local government I am broadly in agreement with the views ofthe Lord President.      In addition, I think it right to bring to notice some points arising on the work of my Department whichhave a bearing on the issue.2. In the provinces in the present state of uncertainty about the future of local government boundaries it is, I am afraid, substantial^ true to say that the local authorities in framing their proposals for the future planning and developmentof their areas do&quot; so with an eye to their expectations ofboundary extensions, and sometimes are governed almost entirely by this consideration, with very ill effects.      The CountyBorough tries to site future development in a place which ithopes subsequently to get incorporated within its boundaries.The County Council opposes that development because it is afraid of losing the area to the County Borough.     Alternatively, theCounty Borough may embark on a policy of holding on to its population by high density development.This is an unhealthy state of affairs and the soonerit is brought to an end the better.     Planning is not just a paper exercise, and the development plans made in the next fewyears are intended to provide the framework for all the activitiesof local authorities for many years to come - roads, housing,education, sewers and local development of every kind.      Ifplanning is badly done or, through local jealousies, not done atall, this framework will be faulty and inadequate as a basis for local authority development generally.     Recent experience showsthat in many cases it will not be done well until the localgovernment boundary question is settled.Meanwhile, I do not think that the appointment of a royal Commission will do anything to relieve matters.      I agreewith the Lord President that the chances of obtaining a satis-factory report from a Royal Commission are slight and that legislation early in the next Parliament based on the sort of report we are likely to get from a Royal Commission would bedifficult.3. There seem to me to be two problems which, thoughrelated, can be tackled separately in different ways:-(a)   The Provinces.      In the 1947 Report of the boundary commission we have a useful framework on which theGovernment could base their own proposals for theprovinces for promulgation to the local authoritiesCOPY NO.3

and subsequent discussion with them.      Judging byAppendix B of the paper which the Minister of Health submitted to the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (i+9) 16)the only body of local authorities which is knownofficially to be pressing for a Royal Commission is theCounty Boroughs, and it is noteworthy that the non-County Boroughs have expressed their support of the boundary Commission&apos;s recommendations with a minorqualification.     Even among the County Boroughs I am.fairly sure that there are some who are not opposedindividually, though they stand together as a group.      Imay add that, so far as I am able to judge, the novelproposals by the Boundary Commission for the re-organisation of local government in Lancashire seem tooffer a real prospect of helping to solve about themost formidable problem with which I am faced outside london - namely the redistribution of the overcrowdedpopulation of Merseyside and the Manchester area.      Inmy view, an inter-departmental committee should now be instructed to prepare proposals based on the 1947Report.(b)    Greater London.      Prom my point of view this is most urgent.      The Government have accepted and adopted as their policy the recommendations of the Greater LondonPlan.      But it is one thing to approve the Plan.      Itis quite another to implement it.      In March, 1946, Iappointed a Committee under Mr. Clement Davies to advise on the appropriate machinery for securing concerted action in the implementation of a Regional Plan for london as a whole.      I received their Report inFebruary last and it will shortly be published.The Committee are satisfied (and I agree with them)that v/ith the Government of Greater London as it is atpresent constituted, the Plan cannot be effectivelyimplemented and that a major change in the local govern-ment structure is needed.They therefore recommend that the Government shouldremit to an ad hoc Commission equipped with wellqualified Commissioners able to devote a large part oftheir time to the work and with a full-time staff, thetask of reviewing the whole Region,  and of submitting. proposals for its government.This does not imply a Royal Commission.      Indeed, the committee have., I think, made it clear that a body of that kindwill not in their view meet the case.     What they had in mind wasa body like the Local Government Boundary Commission and it seemsto me that there is a good deal to be said for this.First the facts have got to be assembled and presented.That seems an appropriate task, as the Clement Davies Committeesuggests-, for a group giving most of their time to the work andwith a full time staff.      It could not in my view be given to an inter-departmental committee already entrusted with the problemof the provinces.      (In this connection I assume that some of theinformation for Greater London outside the administrative Countywill already have been collected.by the Boundary Commission.)

Then the Government have got to make up their mindswhat they want to do (only they can do this, the more so becausedifferent Departments may have different views and differentinterests) and then discuss their proposals with the localauthorities..I cannot help thinking that this would be a moreexpeditious and appropriate procedure than reference of theissue (which is after all one of major policy; to anindependent body of Royal Commissioners.L.
