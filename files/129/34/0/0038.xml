(49) 108Uth May, 1949CABINETCOMMUNISTS AND FASCISTS:   OUTSTATIONS OF THE SEEVICEAND SUPPLY DEPARTMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of defence the Committee on Subversive Activities have considered proposals by theService Ministers and the Minister of Supply about the classification of theoutstations of their Departments from the point of view of the employment in them of untrustworthy persons. A decision is necessary not only in order to give effectto the policy announced in the Prime Ministers statement of 15th March, 1948,but also to enable an answer to be given to enquiries on the point from the staff associations and trade unions concerned.2. For the purpose of analysis the outstations have been divided into fourgroups, as shown in Annex A, in order of importance from the security pointof view. Annex B shows the number of those employed (both non-industrial andindustrial) by each Department in each group. The total field some 360,000employees is large. The numbers in groups I and II, however, are some 60,000and some 85,000 respectively.3. There are arguments for classifying as secret all the outstations, with afew exceptions in Group IV, and for informing the staff associations and tradeunions accordingly. In most outstations secret work is in fact carried out,especially in emergency, and difficulties would arise over postings of staff if only some of the outstations were classified as secret. On the other hand, it would bedifficult to sustain, if challenged, the thesis that all the work of some of theoutstations concerned is &quot; vital&quot; to the security of the State.4. The Ministers concerned have, therefore, reached the conclusion (inwhich the Committee on Subversive Activities concur) that outstations of theService and Supply Departments should not be formally classified as secret ornon-secret. Instead^ Ministers would reserve the right to remove any untrust-worthy individual if he was engaged on, or in connexion with, secret work, orin a position where he might ha.ve access to information vital to the security ofthe State. To this end Ministers would proceed, at a pace determined by theresources of the Security Service, with vetting of staff employed in outstationsbroadly in the order of priority indicated in Annex A. In addition the security service, if they knew of the presence of Communists or Fascists in any of theoutstations, whatever its group, would report the fact to the Department concerned.The case of any Communist or Fascist brought to notice in either of these ways,or by other means, would be considered by the Minister concerned on its individualmerits, but action would be taken only where there was a convincing case thatthe individual had access to secret information in the course of his work.5.   The information to be given to staff associations and trade unions wouldbe to the effect that Ministers, in applying to outstations the Governmenfs policy37038
regarding the employment of untrustworthy persons, did not intend to proceed by reference to a formal classification of outstations as secret or no -secret. cases would be considered on their merits, and Ministers would reserve the right toremove any individual if he was engaged on, or. in connection with, secret work,or in a position where he might have access to information vital to the securityof the State.6. I ask the Cabinet to approve the proposals set out in paragraphs 4 and 5above.A. V. A.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1,14*//, May, 1049.ANNEX AClassification of Outstations in Order of Importance from the- - Security Point of view. Establishments which are concerned with research and future planning,or where there is access to information which is of vital importance to security and the divulging of which would be far-reaching in its effects..viJ II. Establishments which are concerned with matters other than researchwhere secrecy of certain aspects of the work is similar to category I but wherethe risk to the State is less in the event of disclosure. This includes establishmentsdealing with or likely to deal with training of personnel in the use of specialisedequipment and&apos; also establishments where vital information as to the size or intended use of the Forces would be available.III. Establishments where information of a secret nature is available but- where the information is of a more limited character, or in whose case theinformation would only acquire the importance of category II if it were combined with information from other establishments located elsewhere.IV. Establishments dealing with information which would not be vital to security. ,:;    , t       ;ANNEX BNumber Employed in each CategoryCategory		Admiralty		War Office		Air Ministry		Ministry of Supply		Total			Indus-trial	Non-Indus-trial	Indus-trial	Non-Indus-trial	Indus-trial	Non-Indus-trial	Indus-trial	Non-Indus-trial	Indus-trial	Non-Indus-trial		2,800	4,000	2,305	2,159	2,029	2,129	25,326	19,444	32,460	27,7:32,11		7,700	1,450	11,046	3,701	17,680	5,533	33,446	5,178	69,872	15,862III		84,050	10,400	49,392	18,248	31,293	6,488	&apos; 558	454.	165,293	35,590IV		2,550	450	6,552	1,831	333	140	3,535	324	12,970	2,745Total ...		97,100	16,300	69,295	25,939	51,335	14,290	62,865	25,400	280,595	81,929
