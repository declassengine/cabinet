CONFIDENTIAL ,questions OF PROCEDURE FOR ministers.-CABINET PROCEDUREPreparation of Business for the Cabinet1.   The business of th.e Cabinet consists, in the main, of (i) Questions of major policy which affect a number of Departments orengage the collective responsibility of the Government.(ii) Questions on which there is a conflict of interest between Departments-which has not been resolved.2. Except in cases of extreme urgency, questions falling under the second of these heads should not be referred to the Cabinet until all possible means of resolving the conflict have been exhausted, including personal correspondence ordiscussion between the Ministers concerned.3. Similarly, it is the rule that matters falling under the first head shouldbe thoroughly examined at the official level, if necessarily interdepartmentally,before they are referred to Ministers, so that the policy decisions required may be clearly denned.4. Proposals which involve expenditure or affect general financial or economic policy should always be discussed with the Treasury and, if Treasuryagreement has not been secured at the official level, with the Chancellor of theExchequer before they are submitted to the Cabinet or to a ministerial committee. Full consideration must also be given to the probable cost in termsof man-power of any proposal involving new or extended administrative commit-ments. It is a standing instruction that any proposals submitted for considera-tion shall, if they would involve the employment of additional staff or would place a financial burden on the Exchequer, be accompanied by an estimate of (a) the man-power likely to be required by Government Departments (andalso, where practicable, an estimate of the man-power required outsidethe Government service); and(b) the cost to the Exchequer, whether direct or through grants-in-aid oflocal rates.An indication should always be given that the cost to the Exchequer has been dis-cussed with the Treasury; and special attention should be drawn to proposalsof whose potential man-power requirements the Treasury have not been informed.5. These rules do not, of course, limit the right of Ministers to submit tothe Cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.6. Ministers should not hesitate to consult the Law OfficerSj as colleagues in the Government, on legal questions which arise in the formulation and admin-ist ration of policy.7. Matters which fall wholly within the Departmental responsibility of asingle Ministerand do not engage the collective responsibility of the government need not be brought to Cabinet at all. A precise definition of such matters cannotbe given and in borderline cases a Minister is well advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.8. When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at the Cabinet, the PrimeMinisters consent should be sought; and the earliest possible notice should begiven to the Secretary.Cabinet Memoranda9. A memorandum intended for consideration by the Cabinet, other thanone commenting on a memorandum already circulated, must be circulated two clear
days before the meeting at which it is to be considered. A precise formulation ofthis rule has been issued to all Departments by the Secretary of the Cabinet, who iitresponsible for seeing that it is strictly enforced. The permission of the PrimeMinister is required for any exception to this rule and will be granted only incases of extreme urgency. -10. Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clear as possible.The model memorandum explains at the outset what the problem is, indicatesbriefly the relevant considerations and concludes with a precise statement of thedecision sought. While it is sometimes useful to include a summary of the main points brought out in the body of the memorandum, such a summary should neverexceed a few lines; any longer summary defeats its purpose and simply meansrepetition. So far as possible prefatory covering notes should be avoided. Tofacilitate reference in discussion, paragraphs should be numbered. Supportingdata may often be relegated to an Appendix. If authority is sought to make astatement or despatch a telegram a draft may be attached. Time spent in makinga memorandum short and clear will be saved many times over in reading and in discussion; and it is the duty of Ministers to ensure that this is done by personalscrutiny, and where necessary revision, of the memoranda submitted to them bytheir officials. In particular, the use of unnecessary neologisms and obscuretechnical terms should be avoided.11. Cabinet memoranda (as distinct from memoranda for Cabinet Com-mittees) are normally reproduced by the Cabinet Office, the text being sent by theoriginating Department to the Cabinet Office for the purpose. If, for any reason,a Cabinet memorandum is reproduced by the originating Department, all copiesthus reproduced must be sent to the Cabinet Office, application being made to theCabinet Office for any additional copies required by the reproducing Department.If an originating Department so wishes, a standing arrangement may be made whereby the Cabinet Office will automatically supply a fixed number of additionalcopies of memoranda.12. Subject to such special instructions in regard to any particular paper ashe may receive from the Prime Minister or from the responsible Minister, theSecretary circulates memoranda and other documents prepared for their use to all members of the Cabinet and, where appropriate, to other Ministers whoseDepartments are affected.13. In no circumstances, other than those provided for in paragraph 11above, are Cabinet memoranda to he reproduced or copied in Departments. Ifa Department requires an additional copy or copies of a memorandum, applicationmust in every case be made to the Cabinet Office.Attendance at Cabinet14. It is of assistance to the Secretary if Private Secretaries indicate, whenasking for a subject to be placed on the Agenda, which Ministers, other thanmembers of the Cabinet, are likely to be affected, so that arrangements may, ifnecessary, be made for their attendance.15. Ministers summoned to meetings of the Cabinet for particular items will receive an Agenda Paper on which an approximate time will be set against eachitem. Every endeavour is made not to keep Ministers waiting, but the time atwhich each item will be reached cannot be forecast exactly. Cabinet meetings take precedence over other business. The utmost endeavours Ishould be made by ministers to be punctual and thus avoid wasting the time of their colleagues.16. The Prime Ministers Private Secretary on duty at the Cabinet roomis responsible for ensuring that the proceedings of the Cabinet are not disturbed.To assist him, Ministers should give general instructions that messages are notto be sent to them while in Cabinet, unless they are so urgent that they cannotwait until the end of the meeting.17. If a member of the Cabinet, or a Minister summoned, for a particularitem, is unable, for anv reason, to be present at a meeting of the Cabinet, he should notify the Secretary, who will inform the Prime Minister and will also considerwhether any rearrangement of business is required.18. The Secretary should also be informed of Ministers&apos; out-of-town engage-ments, and also of their week-end and holiday arrangements, in order that, if somesudden emergency arises, he may be in a position to inform the Prime Minister atonce which Ministers are immediately available.
Cabinet Conclusions19. It is an instruction to the Secretary, in drafting Cabinet Conclusions-to avoid, so far as practicable, reference to opinions expressed by particularMinisters. The record m respect of each item will be limited to the decision ofthe Cabinet, together with such summary of the discussion as may be necessaryfor the guidance of those called upon to take action on the decision. Matters of exceptional secrecy may be recorded in a &quot; Confidential Annex.&quot;.20- Copies of the Conclusions are circulated by the Secretary to cabinet ministers and Ministers of Cabinet rank. Copies of &quot;Confidential Annexes &quot;are sent only to the Ministers directly concerned.21. Any suggested amendments to Cabinet Conclusions must reach theSecretary not later than the next day but one following that on which the Meeting-was held.  Thereafter the Conclusions will be sent to be printed in final form.22. All Ministers are responsible for giving such instructions to their departments as may be necessary to give effect to the Conclusions of the Cabinet,and for communicating to subordinate Departments or branches decisions of whichthey should be made aware. Where an urgent matter arises in Cabinetunexpectedly, and a decision is reached requiring immediate action by a Depart-ment not represented at the meeting, the Secretary will ensure that the department concerned is notified forthwith.23. Where a Department has to take action upon, or is otherwise directly affected by, a particular Conclusion, the actual decisions of the Cabinet on that matter may be copied in the Department, together with so much of the record of the discussion as is essential to a proper understanding of them, and theseextracts may be passed to responsible officers in the Department, as may benecessary. The distribution within a Department of such extracts from cabinet conclusions should be limited to the occasions on which it is strictly necessary forthe efficient discharge of public business and care should be taken to see thatextracts are sent only to those officers of the Department who need be acquainted with the actual terms of the decision. Duplicate copies of the complete conclusions are not issued for this purpose by the Cabinet Office save in exceptional cases.Where action has to be taken at once by a Department without waiting for the circulation of the full Conclusions, application may be made to the Secretaryfor an advance copy of the relevant Conclusions.24. In this connection the position of the Parliamentary Secretary shouldnot be overlooked. He may have to deputise for his Minister, at Cabinet or in theHouse, at short notice. Apart from any special responsibility assigned to him ina limited field, he should be fully informed of the work of the Department and kept in general touch with all Cabinet matters affecting it, so that when calledupon to attend a meeting in place of the Minister he understands the subject and does not merely recite a brief. (On the work of Parliamentary Secretaries generallysee CP. (49) 31.)Return of Cabinet Documents25. Cabinet documents remain the property of the Crown. The normal prac-tice is, therefore, that Ministers, on relinquishing office, return to the cabinet office all Cabinet documents, with the exception of any immediately required for current administration, which may be handed on to their successors. In order tofacilitate this arrangement, Ministers are asked to arrange for the return to the: &quot;Cabinet Office during their tenure of office, say, at intervals of three to six months,of such Cabinet documents as are not required for current administration.The provision above for handing on certain Cabinet documents to a Ministerssuccessor does not always apply on a change of Government: special instructionswill be issued to cover such cases.II-COMMITTEES OF THE CABINETCommittee Procedure26.   The procedure outlined above applies mutatis mutandis to ministerial committees of the Cabinet.27. While Committee meetings provide at times a useful forum for the dis-cussion of policy and for enabling Ministers to ensure that their points of view
are understood and to make a contribution to the formulation of policy, their primeobject is the despatch of business and the making of decisions. Interdepartmentalquestions should be settled as far as possible between officials, or failing that between Ministers, of the Departments directly concerned. They should not beallowed to drag on. Where colleagues have to be consulted, but only two or threeare directly concerned, agreement can often be reached by correspondence or by personal meetings; much time can be saved by personal contact. Failing agree-ment recourse can be had to the Prime Minister, Lord President or Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. This will often make it unnecessary to take the matter to aCommittee. -28. Particular points which the Prime Minister wishes the Chairmen of committees to keep in mind are : (a) Care should be taken to prevent papers coming forward for discussion which could be settled otherwise; and Secretaries of Committees shouldbe encouraged to submit suggestions for reducing the amount ofbusiness to be transacted at full meetings.(6) Attendance should be restricted to the permanent members and other ministers who have a major interest in the question under discussion.Ministers should not be required to sit through lengthy discussions incase points affecting their Departments should be raised; nor should they insist on attending meetings for the purpose of making Depart-mental points which have no important&apos; bearing on the main issuesunder discussion. Arrangements should be made for the attendance of one of the Law Officers at meetings at which legal issues are likelyto arise. .(c) Discussion should be kept to the point; irrelevance or repetition shouldbe checked.(d) Conclusions should not be framed in a way which will require further discussion by Ministers, if that is not necessary. Once a policy deci-sion has been taken, responsibility for its detailed working out andthe supervision of its execution can usually be left to the Ministersdepartmentally concerned.(e) The dilatory process of referring a question from one Committee toanother should be avoided as far as possible.(f) Much time is lost in the aggregate if meetings do not begin punctuallyat the appointed hour.Secrecy of Cabinet Committees29. While the collective responsibility of Ministers often calls for discussion between Ministers on some important question which falls wholly or mainlywithin the purview of a single Department, the normal course is for the resultingdecision to be announced and defended by the Minister concerned as his owndecision.30. There may be rare occasions when it is desirable to emphasise theimportance of some decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. This, however, should be the exception rather than the rule. The growth of any general practice whereby decisions of the Cabinet were announced as such would lead to embarrassment. Thus, some decisions ofGovernment would be regarded as less authoritative than others. It is contraryto accepted practice for Government decisions to be announced in terms whichdisclose or imply that they have been reached by a particular Committee of theCabinet. Critics of the decision reached by a particular Ministerial Committeewould press for its review by some other Committee or by the Cabinet, while theconstitutional right of individual Ministers to speak in the name of theGovernment as a whole would be impaired.31. The underlying principle is, of course, that the method adopted by ministers for discussion among themselves of questions of policy is essentially a domestic matter, and is no concern of Parliament or the public. The doctrine of collective responsibility of Ministers depends, in practice, upon the existence of opportunities for free and frank discussion between them, and such discussion ishampered if the processes by which it is carried on are laid bare.32. For these reasons it is also the general peace-time practice to avoiddisclosure of particulars of the composition and terms of reference of cabinet committees, other than of one or two long-established Standing Committees.
5 1III.-PRECAUTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORISED DISCLOSURES OF:.. -&apos;. &apos; - INFORMATION&apos;&quot; &apos;33. Disclosures in the Press of matters under discussion by the Cabinet or its committees damage the reputation of the Government, impair the efficiency of its administration and assist its opponents.The General RuleV 34. Ministers who share the collective responsibility for the governments programme must be generally aware of the development of important aspects ofGovernment policy. But, outside this narrow circle, knowledge of these matters should be confined to those, whether Ministers or officials, whose duty it is to assist in the formulation of the particular policy concerned, or who need to know whatis afoot because of its effect on other aspects of public business for which they areresponsible. -&apos;35; Government policy should not be discussed with persons outside Govern-ment service unless this is necessary for the transaction of public business; and care should be taken to see that private discussions between Members of the Govern-ment are not held in places where they may be overheard. In particular, it is contrary to the doctrine of collective responsibility to make known the attitude of individual Ministers on matters of policy.... .Points to be Kept in Mind36. Ministers have a personal responsibility for ensuring that all members oftheir staffs understand the need for exercising the strictest discretion, and inparticular for seeing that the appropriate precautions are strictly observed in their departments. In this connection the following considerations should be borne inmind : (1) While it is within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal rule is that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy. In particular1,Cabinet papers should not be circulated as a matter of course to Inf or-mation Officers or their staffs. It is important that these officers should have enough background information to enable them to dis-charge their own functions intelligently, and to offer advice on matters within their province in time for it to be effective; and it is necessaryfor these reasons that they should be informed at once of some of thedecisions of the Cabinet or its Committees and, on occasion, of progress;in the formulation of policy by the Cabinet or its Committees. EachMinister is, however, personally responsible for deciding how much ofthis information should be conveyed to his Information Officer; andit is preferable that the information should be imparted, with appro-priate guidance, by the Minister himself.(2) Ministers are expected to exercise a real measure of control in this matter,,and must satisfy themselves from time to time that their instructions are being carried out.(3) A Minister who is a Member of the Cabinet has responsibilitieswider than those of his own Department, and will in that capacityreceive some documents which are of no concern to any of his subordinates.(4) A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of the Government;and the information given to him should be correspondingly limited.(5) Documents containing or reflecting the personal views of Ministers arein a special category, and their handling requires special care, if the collective responsibility of the Cabinet as a whole is to be preserved.This applies particularly to the Minutes of the Cabinet and its-main Standing Committees, in the handling of which the procedure laiddown in paragraph 23 above should be followed.(6) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable number ofofficers should be consulted in particular issues arising out of cabinet memoranda, this should be done by means of minutes addressed to theofficers concerned, confined to the particular points on which they arerequired to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of the memorandathemselves.
(7) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often dccurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of thePress, of isolated scraps 01 information, each in itself apparently of... little importance, gathered from several sources. The only safe rule is, therefore, never to mention such matters even in the form of guardedallusions, except to those who must be informed of them for reasons ofState, until the time has come when disclosure^ in whole or in part, is authorised. Reasons of State may require, in appropriate cases, the confidential communication of some information to a responsible editor,lobby correspondent, &amp;c, for purposes of guidance; but such communi-cation is only justified where it can be ensured that the confidence andthe terms on which it is made are respected.Need for Discretion37. Secrecy cannot, however, be secured solely by rules, however carefullydrawn, restricting the circulation of papers; public business cannot be transactedwithout a fairly wide dissemination of confidential information within Govern-ment circles; and the essential point is the observance of a high standard of discretion.by all who acquire knowledge of such information in the course of their duties an attitude of mind which puts first the interests of the Government as awhole and subordinates everything to that end. It is the duty of Ministers to setthis standard of discretion in regard to all confidential matte-a which come within their knowledge, to give an example to others, and to see that their example isfollowed.Responsibility of the Lord Chancellor38. The Prime Minister has asked the Lord Chancellor to assume a general responsibility for investigating unauthorised disclosures of information about theproceedings of the Cabinet or Cabinet Committees. Ministers are asked to notify the Lord Chancellor of any such disclosure which comes to their notice and toassist him in any investigation involving their Department.- ;     . IV.-MINISTERIAL SPEECHES, BROADCASTS, &amp;c.General39. When addressing meetings Ministers must keep within the ambit ofGovernment policy and not anticipate decisions not yet made public They mustbe careful in dealing with matters within the responsibility of other Ministersriot to embarrass them by statements at variance with Ministerial pronouncements.In all cases of doubt they should consult the Minister concerned.40. The Foreign Office should invariably be consulted before any mention ismade of matters affecting our relations with foreign Powers or foreign affairs;and Ministers wishing to make reference to broad matters of defence policy should in all cases first consult the Minister of Defence. Ministers should alsobe specially careful in referring to matters affecting our relations with self-governing Commonwealth countries, or to the political aspects of Colonial affairs,e.g., self-government in certain Colonies, and should consult the commonwealth relations Office or Colonial Office respectively, except where the matter fallswithin their own responsibility.41. In the present international situation care is needed as to what is said by Ministers in conversations at social functions at Embassies. If matters offoreign policy are discussed at such functions, a note should be made afterwards ofthe salient points of the conversation and a copy sent to the Foreign Secretary.Effect on Parliamentary Business,42. Unless they have first obtained the agreement of the Leader of the Houseof Commons, Ministers should avoid saying anything which might affect theprogramme of Government business in Parliament. Thus, they should not, with-out his agreement, promise White Papers, the publication of which might resultin a demand for a special debate: and legislation should never be promisedwithout the express approval of the Cabinet or the Legislation Committee. Thisis a matter in which special care is necessary, since statements made by ministers are liable to be represented in the Press as foreshadowing early legislation.
Speeches at Parliamentary By-Elections and Local Government Elections43. Members of the Cabinet should not normally speak at By-Elections; but other Ministers, including those of Cabinet rank, may do so. As a general ruleMinisters above the rank of Parliamentary Secretary should not speak at localgovernment elections.. There may, however, be occasions on which a Minister may&apos;feel obliged to do so for special reasons, particularly in his own constituency.Broadcasting Arrangements44.   Ministerial broadcasts should be kept to the minimum.  All Ministers      cpI i*iintending to broadcast should communicate with the Postmaster-General, who fr0 ,^.(will be responsible for obtaining the Prime Minister^ approval in all cases and /^a)^for making the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C.   In view of the factthat broadcasts by Ministers may be regarded by the B.B.C. or by the Opposition aecontroversial and therefore giving a claim to a reply, the subject of the broadcastmust in all cases be given and the Prime Minister may require to see either an outline or the text of a broadcast before giving approval.V.-PRESS ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS BY MINISTERSPress Articles45. Ministers are precluded from journalism in any form; but this prohibition-prohibition does not extend to authorship of writings of a literary, historical, scientific,philosophical or romantic character.  For these there are abundant precedents.46. This rule need not be interpreted as debarring Ministers from writing,on occasion, articles or letters to newspapers, in order to supplement the meansalready used for enlightening the public in regard to measures before parliament and other administrative questions affecting the work of their Departments. (Onreplies to letters and statements in the Press, see paragraph 62 below.)47. Should a Minister deem it necessary to write such an article, he shouldnot accept payment if it is offered. In deciding whether to write an article heshould bear in mind his obligations to Parliament. For example, he should be careful not to discuss a Bill before it has received its Second Reading in the&quot;House of Commons.48.   These rules govern dealings with the foreign as well as the home Press.Interviews49. The granting of special interviews to individual Press representativesis a matter for the discretion of the Minister concerned. As a general rule,however, the same considerations should apply as for written articles, i.e., ifgranted, an interview should be confined to elucidating the policy or work of theMinister and Department concerned. The same considerations regarding obliga-tions to Parliament also apply, and Ministers should bear in mind that an inter-view granted to a representative of a single newspaper or agency may arousejealousy and thus hostility in the rest of the Press.Contributions to Party Publications50. The general prohibition on the writing of articles for the Press neednot be regarded as debarring Ministers from contributing to the publications ofthe political organisations with which they are associated. Payment should not he accepted for such articles.General51. In general, Ministers should keep such activities to a minimum, andbear in mind that their relations with the Press are always liable to be the subjectof Questions in Parliament. Ministers should refer to the Prime Minister in anycase about which they are in doubt.
VI.-PARLIAMENTARY PRIVATE SECRETARIES52. Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special position which is not-always understood by the general public, either at home or abroad. They are not members of the Government, and should be careful not to be spoken of as such.They are Private Members, and should therefore be afforded as great a liberty of action as possible; but their close and confidential association with Ministersnecessarily imposes certain obligations on them, and has led to the generally accepted practice set out in the following paragraph.53. Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statements in theHouse or put Questions on matters affecting the Department with which theyare connected. They should also exercise great discretion in any speeches orbroadcasts which they make outside the House, taking care not to make statements which appear to be made in an official or semi-official capacity, and bearing inmind at the same time that, however careful they may be to make it clear thatthey are speaking only as Private Members, they are nevertheless liable to beregarded as speaking with some of the authority which attaches to a member ofthe Government. Generally they must act with a sense of responsibility and with discretion; and they must not associate themselves with particular groupsadvocating special policies.^  VII.-ABSENCE OF MINISTERS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM54. It is the established practice for a Member of the Cabinet or a minister in charge of a Department to obtain the King&apos;s permission to be absent from theUnited Kingdom, whether on duty or on leave, and to inform His Majesty of thearrangements which he proposes to make for the administration of his officeduring that time.55. Any such arrangements must have the Prime Minister&apos;s prior approval and are subject to certain general limitations. In the absence of a Secretary ofState, submissions to His Majesty must be made on his behalf by another Secretaryof State. Submissions on behalf of the First Lord of the Admiralty may be madein his absence by the Senior Lord Commissioner. In the absence of other cabinet ministers, submissions may be made by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Depart-ment concerned, if he is a Privy Councillor; if not, by another Cabinet Minister.56. Parliamentary Secretaries who wish to be absent from the UnitedKingdom should obtain the consent of the Prime Minister as well as of their ownMinister.VIII.-MISCELLANEOUS57. Ministers may find it helpful to have available in this note a referenceto instructions issued from time to time on other procedural and allied matters.Statements after Questions58. When Parliament is in session, important announcements of Govern-ment policy should be made, in the first instance, in Parliament. At the sametime it is desirable to keep to the minimum the number of announcements madeby way of statements at the end of Questions.Ministers are asked to conform with the following procedure : (a) Ministers proposing to make a statement after Questions, whether ornot it is related to a Question on the Order Paper, should notify thePrime Ministers Private Secretary as early as possible and in any event not later than 10 a.m. on the day on which the statement isto be made. Particulars should be given of the subject matter of theproposed statement, the date on which it is desired to make it, and.the grounds for making it on that date and adopting this method of announcement. It should also be stated whether the announcementhas been approved by the Cabinet or one of its Committees.
(6) Copies of the da-aft statement should be sent, as soon as it is available,to the Prime Ministers Private Secretary and to the Leader of theHouse of Commons and the Chief Whip. These copies should arrivenot later than 10 a.m. on the day on which the statement is to be made.(c) It is at times desirable that a copy of such a statement should be shown to the Opposition shortly before it is made. If this is desired, a copyof the final text, should reach the office of the Chief Whip in theHouse *of Commons not later than 10 a.m. on (the day on which thestatement, is to be made.(d) A copy of the final text should in all cases be sent to the Speaker.(e) It may sometimes be expedient that a statement should be made simuLtaneously in the House of Lords. Ministers should, where necessary,,consult the Leader of the House of Lords on this point.Publicity Arrangements for White Papers59. Care must be taken to avoid any possibility of an infringement, ofParliamentary Privilege when publicity arrangements are made for white papers. The accepted practice is for final revised proof copies of White Papersto be made available to Lobby Correspondents somewhat in advance of their being laid in the Vote Office and for Ministers to hold a Lobby Conference if they thinkit desirable. The Prime Minister has made his Adviser on Public Relationsresponsible for these arrangements generally and he should always be consulted by Departmental officials if there is any question of a wider advance distributionthan this. Such wider distribution-e.g., to industrial correspondents is to be avoided save in exceptional circumstances.Signature on Subordinate Legislation60. As a normal rule Ministers should themselves sign all statutory instru-ments (other than Orders in Council) which fall within the terms of reference ofthe Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, i.e., all instruments laid or laid indraft before Parliament, being instruments upon which proceedings may be, or might have been, taken in either House in pursuance of any Act of Parliament.Crown Proceedings Act61; Under the provisions of the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947, an order fordiscovery of documents may be made against Government Departments. If, how-ever, the appropriate Minister is of opinion that the production of a particulardocument would be injurious to the public interest, he may withhold productionof that document. This right to withhold production of a document is of thegreatest importance and should be exercised only after the most careful considera-tion. The Minister himself must personally consider the document in question and form his own judgment, with such advice as he thinks fit to take, whether ornot the public interest would be injuriously affected by its disclosure.Replies to Letters and Statements in the Press62. Possible methods of dealing with letters and statements to the Presswhich are inaccurate or otherwise objectionable are set out in CP. (47) 178. Thegeneral line to be taken was stated in the Prime Ministers reply to a question on 8th October, 1946-&apos;&apos; It should be, I think, a general rule that, where the personal conductof Ministers is concerned, the matter should be dealt with by the minister himself.&quot;   (Hansard, Vol. 427, Col. 25),-and the reply given by Mr. Churchill in the House On 22nd February, 1945 &apos;&apos; The best practice is that Ministers of the Crown should themselvesexpound all matters of Government policy, and that press interviews by officials should only be given on Ministerial responsibility and after dueauthorisation by the political chief. Such expressions of opinion by officialswould usually nave regard to technical aspects only. Of course, in an emer-gency, exceptions may be made. The principle of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament is paramount &quot; (Hansard, Vol. 408, Col. 954).
63. Letters to the Press from Information Officers should be purely inf information-tive and must not enter into arguments on the merits of Government policy.Consultation with the Trades Union Congress, &amp;c.64. Ministers should be careful to ensure that, wherever appropriate, theTrades Union Congress and in suitable cases individual Trades Unions are taken into consultation at an early stage. Hard and fast rules cannot be laiddown and individual Ministers must judge cases on their own merits. Thenormal practice as regards consultation on matters of general industrial policy andprinciple and on appointments to Government bodies, &amp;c, is outlined in CP.(47) 46. Ministers should also bear in mind the desirability of including in the membership of Government Committees and other bodies, where appropriate,either an official representative of the Co-operative Movement or a member of theCo-operative Movement.chosen in his personal capacity.Employment of Judges65. Ministers should not approach Judges for extra-judicial work without consulting the Lord Chancellor./
