THE LONDON DOCK strike memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the relevant facts of this dispute .are set out in theattached statement which I made in the House of Commons to-day,I do not think it is necessary to add to that statement except to say that later in the afternoon it was learned that theTooley Street Wharves had stopped; leaving&quot; only Tilbury andthe permanent weekly men at workaWhilst the ostensible object of the strike is toprevent the dismissals of the 32 men, the real purpose is toensure that removals from the Register should only take placethrough normal wastage.   The class of men about whom the disputehas arisen are Category &apos;C5 men, that is, men who by reasonof age or infirmity, are required to attend one call a dayonly.    Their reward if they get no work is attendance money atthe rate of 5/- per day.    It is contended that so long as these men satisfy the requirement of attending one call aday and do not infringe any of the rules of the Scheme, theyshould be retained on the Register indefinitely.   discussions are at present proceeding on the question of a Pensions Schemeand it may be that if a mutually satisfactory agreement were reached, the cause of the present agitation would be removed.However&apos;that may be, it is clear that any concession along the lines demanded would be&apos; unjustified.   No other industry could sustain such a burden and it v/ould prove intolerableto the Dock Industry.The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and theNational Union of General and Municipal Workers fully acceptthe&apos;need for a comb-out of these 1!ineff ectives&quot;.    The NationalAmalgamated Stevedores and Dockers now officially oppose this measure although it follows an agreed decision of theNational Dock Labour boards in my view,  this strike must be firmly resisted andthere is no room for concessions of any kind.An officer of my Department this morning attended ameeting of the National Dock Labour Board, which was sitting in full session, with the exception of Mr* Barrett,theGeneral Secretary of the National Amalgamated Stevedores andDockers, who hod left the meeting,.   The Board stated their view most strongly that no concession should be made and theyadvocated that the Government should immediately takeemergency powers as was done on the occasion of the strike inJune last.Close touch has been maintained with the transport and General workers Union, who to-day issued a full printedstatement to every member, setting out the facts of the casesCOPY NO.31CABINETSECRETC*P*(u10) 8912TH APRIL, 19U9

involved and concluding with the following points:- -&quot;(1)   The policy of this Union is that we must abide bythe machinery that has been established between&apos; the National Dock Labour1 Board and ourselvesunder the Dock Labour Regulation Scheme.(2)   Every one of our members has had the opportunityof presenting his case and also has the rightof being represented at his appeal by an official of his Union.(3)    In the circumstances wc say to our members that thestrike is unwarranted.   The facts of each particular case are known.(k)    Of the total employed in the Port of London,which is approximately 27,000, the numberinvolved is as stated above.(5)    It cannot be said that there has been anydesire or attempt to deal with any questionof redundancy.    The issue is as to whethera man is an effective Port Worker or not.wIt seems to me clear that the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union can be fully relied on to make theutmost efforts to secure a resumption.The position has also been diocussed fully with thePort Employers.    They originally took the view that theScheme should be suspended in London so as t0 restore to themfull freedom of action to engage anyone who wished to volunteer.After discussion, however, they no longer press this suggestionbut they have stated their conviction that if the membersof the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union now on strikecan be released from the effect of the Continuity Rulewhich ties the men to the gangs existing-prior to the strike,the men would resume on fresh engagements which would enablefresh gangs to be built up.   I am taking this point up with theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union to see whether there is any possibility of securing the Union&apos;s co-operation onthese lines.As regards the National Amalgamated Stevedores and.Dockers, I had an invitation issued to the Executive thismorning,  to attend at the Ministry to give an explanation oftheir action in lending official support to an illegal strike.As there was a good deal of resistance to this invitation aletter,  as appended, was sent by hand.   Later in the afternoon,they intimated by telephone that they were unable to respond to the invitation to-day but would attend tomorrow (&quot;Wednesday)afternoon.    They announced their intention, however, to bringthe Executive of the Lightermen&apos;s Union as well who, theydeclared, were solid with them and who would tonight alsodeclare an official strike.    I have now received information that at the mass meeting&apos; of the Lightermen this evening therewas a comfortable majority against strike action.   I have allowed information to be given to the Press about theinsistence of the stevedores that they would bring theLightermen&apos;s Executive to the meeting tomorrow as I think theLightermen&apos;s decision is a most significant development.I am most hopeful that it indicates that the strike does notcommand the support which it was planned to receive.

It has been suggested to me that I should broadcasttomorrow night.   Subject to any developments tomorrow, I feelthat this might have valuable results, particularly if theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union can see their way topermit- their members to accept fresh engagements.    I havenot yet.attempted to draft a broadcast talk as its contentwill depend greatly on the events of tomorrow.Mass meetings of the Stevedores and Dockers Sectionsof the National Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers are being held tomorrow and it is difficult to assess the position untilthe results of those meetings are known but I feel that, inview of the Lightermen1 s decision, we should not assume thatthe strike will spread to other ports, although I am informedthat that will .be attempted.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,12th April, 1949.

STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR and national SERVICE IN THE HOUSE OP COMMONS,12TH APRILf  lqgq.Private Notice Question by Mr. Eden:MR. EDEN (by Private Notice Question) asked the Minister if he would make a statement on the strike at the London Docks.MR.  ISAACS:    Yes, Sir.      In discharge of their responsibility under the Scheme,  the National Dock Labour-Board on 26th November last issued a directive to the LocalBoards, instructing them to remove from the Register menwho, by reason of failing health or other physical incapacitywhich appeared to be of a permanent nature, were unable to &apos;meet the minimum requirements of the Scheme, or. men who forany other reason were not carrying out to the full their obligations under the Scheme, whether in the reserve pool orm employment.The National Dock Labour Board includes fourrepresentatives of employers and four representatives-ofworkers,  the workers&apos;  representatives being drawn from theTransport and G-eneral Workers&apos; Union,  the National Union of-eneral and Municipal Workers,  and the National Amalgamated-Stevedores and. Dockers, end I am informed .by the Board thatthe directive was issued after full discussion and as aresult of a unanimous decision.     This directive has been implemented in various ports throughout the country and inLondon on 10th January the Local Board appointed a Sub-Committee,  consisting of two employers and two trade union representatives to deal with the matter.     Finally,  as aresult- thirty-three men were given notice of termination, totake effect on 9th April.     The men concerned had a right ofappeal to tribunals selected by the two sides of the industry,and twenty-one appeals were lodged. One was allowed, leaving a total of thirty-two men whose notices took effect.Alt-hough the National Amalgamated Stevedores andDockers are represented,  both on the National Board and theLondon Board, members of this Union decided on Sunday lastto stop work on Monday in protest.against the dismissals.The strike has spread and I am informed by the Board thatthere are now approximately 13,000 men on strike, including members of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, whichUnion, however, condemns the strike as being unwarranted.This is a strike against the provisions of a schemewhich was adopted by a National Conference of the workers.      Ifany modification or variation of the Scheme is desired,  theNational Joint Industrial Council for the industry provides themeans by which it- can be discussed and if agreed brought tomy notice.      This stoppage of work,  offecting-as it does thewhole traffic, of the Port of London,  constitutes a challenge to authority.      There can be no doubt it -is inspired by motiveshostile to the best interests of the dockers as a whole andthe public.Important issues are involved and I would ask to beexcused from making any further statement.at present.
