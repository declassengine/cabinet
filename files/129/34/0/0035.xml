THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1949SECRET Cbpy No. 31CP. (49) 105Qth May, 1949CABINETTHE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of Health1. In December last I circulated a short memorandum (CP. (48) 302) onthe progress of the National Health Service in England and Wales. As theCabinet is now to discuss the Service, I should like to add a postscript to that paper bringing it up to date.2.   I tried on that occasion to bring out three main points : (i) The success of the Service in bringing to light and meeting genuineneed.(ii) The dangers of abuse and the steps being taken to check them.(iii) The way in which the cost of the Service was exceeding expectations.Experience since December has confirmed the impressions formed on the basisof five months&apos; operation of the Service.Need for the Service3. Ever since 5th July last the demand for the various services, andparticularly for dental and eye treatment, has been surprisingly high, and currentannual rates of 8 million and 7 million dental and eye cases respectively thoughshowing a slight fall from the peak figures of 8^ million and 8 million -are much higher than was anticipated at this date. The fact is that the genuine needfor these services was, and is, much greater than anyone knew, both the accumulated need of the past and the current need from day to day. This isnot a &quot;luxury&quot; demand like the rush for sweets; people do not apply forspectacles still less visit the dentist or the hospital unless they really think they need help. Deaf aids provide&quot; another example. We are now supplyingthem at the rate of 4,000 a month, and this will soon be nearly doubled; but thereare still tens of thousands of people perhaps hundreds of thousands, for the realneed cannot yet be exactly measured who need deaf aids for their work, andpublic criticism is vocal on the delay in supplying them. All this means that unless we are to deprive people of services they genuinely require we cannot expect the cost of the Service to be as low as we had hoped.Abuse and Checks4. This leads to the next question, how far is expenditure unjustifiable and what can be done to cut out waste and excess ? I mentioned various proposals inparagraphs 4-10 of OP. (48) 302; action is being or has been taken accordingly.First, a ceiling of  4,800 gross ( 2,300 net) above which earnings are halved was imposed on the annual earnings of dentists from 1st February last. Second, Ihave instituted an enquiry into the timing of dental operations on which feesare based, but pending its completion I have opened discussions with the dentalorganisations on a general reduction of fees to operate from the end of may, theobject being an overall cut in gross fees of at least 20 per cent. In advance of a review of timing and overheads, and subject to its results, the fees of ophthal-mologists have been reduced from 1st April by 20 per cent., and those of opticiansare also, by agreement, being reduced from 1st May. There is not much scope for37001
any reduction in the fees of chemists but the arrangements are being reviewed,while, at the same time, in order to check extravagant prescribing, a list of foodswhich should not be prescribed has been circulated to all doctors, together witha list of medicines which may be queried. All these operations of whicli moredetails are given in the Appendix will lead to a fall in the cost per case, thatis, each patient will receive the treatment he needs for less expenditure. Butsubstantial reductions in total expenditure depend on falls in total demands for treatment; arid of that, as I have already said, there is little or no sign.5. It has been suggested in various quarters that there is extravagance in administrative costs, particularly in the hospital service. It is certainly not true of my Department; the central and regional staff engaged on the Service isremarkably small. There also seems to be no justification for the suggestion inrelation to the staffs of executive councils or hospital boards and committees.Administrative costs represent less than 2 per cent, of the total expenditure ofthese bodies. I am, however, looking into the staffing position, and shall not hesitate to press for reductions if they can be justified. It is worth emphasisingthat we are now for the first time able to find out what the administration of hospitals involves in terms of staff and cost hitherto a large part of it has beenconcealed in the central staffs of local authorities. Returns I am collectingwill enable me to see the true picture and to put my finger on extravagance orweakness. In the same way cost accounting, and the development of centralpurchase-both of which are in hand will help to cut down costs. But therecannot be immediate results; the hospital service has still only been in operation for ten months, and we are only just beginning to find out many of the facts whichwere hidden when it was a congeries of independent voluntary and municipalinstitutions, such as the low standards of care in many places, the scandalous over-crowding of mental hospitals and institutions, the gross deficiencies in quality and quantity of staffing, equipment and premises.Cost of the service. That brings me to the question of cost. I mentioned in CP. (48) 302anticipated figures of expenditure for 1948-49 (nine months) and for 1949-50;here 1 should like to make clear what the history of these estimates has been.When those for 1948-49 were prepared in November 1947, seven months beforethe Service was due to start, hardly anything was known of how many people would use it, how many doctors, dentists, &amp;c, would join, or what they would bepaid. I did, however, indicate what I thought the expenditure would be; butfor budgetary reasons the Chancellor asked for a reduction of  22 million. This,together with the increases due to factors whose size was unknown in November1947, made it necessary to go to Parliament for a supplementary estimate of  58million in February. The same story is being repeated now in connection withthe 1949-50 estimates. After examination of the hospital budgets and cutting out some items I indicated what I thought the needs of the community would require,but at the Chancellor&apos;s request for- budgetary reasons a cut of  28 million wasmade. I agreed to this in the hope that demand, particularly for dental treatment and spectacles, might fall off, and that hospitals might by strict economy be able to run at slightly less than the level of expenditure in 1948-49. It is clear that thesehopes will not be fulfilled. (The fact is that we are experiencing in the healthfield what has already happened in the field of education, where expenditure hastrebled between 1944-45 and 1949-50 a rise from  66-5 million to  182 million.)Demand is not falling as I hoped-the needs of the people are greater than we knew and unless services are withheld the reduced estimates will be exceeded.Similarly, on the hospital side the reduced estimate is too low to maintain existing services. The estimates had to be prepared only two months after the new bodiestook over, on the basis of information about past expenditure, which was inade-quate and even inaccurate. There were also factors unknown at the time whichmust now be taken into account, for example, the rates of payment of specialists,the increased rates for staff nurses just agreed by the Chancellor. All this means that additional money must be forthcoming unless beds are to be closed and staffdismissed still more if essential improvements are to be made, such as the recruit-ment of staff to open some of the 50.000 empty beds (which the Chancellor himselfregarded as desirable in his Budget speech) or the replacement or increase ofoutworn or inadequate equipment. I will mention some random examples of thekind of action that will be needed if the present estimates are not to be exceeded.
7. The Manchester Regional Hospital Board were asked to reduce theirbudget by just over  1 million, equivalent to 7-4 per cent, of their total expendi-ture. By economies, postponements of improvements, &amp;o, they can save about ^ million, but to achieve the full cut asked for would mean postponing urgentmaintenance work and the closing of about 1,600 beds. The Liverpool regional hospital Board are in much the same position; they would have to close about 1,500beds. In London the Belgrave Hospital for Children, Clapham Road, and theRoyal Eye Hospital, Southwark, will probably have to be closed down, togetherwith their associated convalescent homes. The Canadian Red Cross Hospital atCliveden will have to close 100 beds.8. The overall picture is then quite clear. If the present estimates are notto be exceeded, services must be withheld which the community has proved iturgently needs dental treatment and spectacles must be refused, beds must be closed, staff dismissed, and waiting lists already appallingly long must grow evenlonger. I do not think my colleagues will wish this to happen; I hope they willshare my view that the additional money must be found to prevent its happening.But if they do not, I shall need their assistance in determining which services should be withheld and which developments cancelled.A. B.Ministry of Health,Qth May, 1949.APPENDIXEstimates 1949-50Savings Effected or proposed. Dental services with effect from 1st February, 1949, authorised fees at a rate exceeding 4,800 a year gross were cut by one-half of the excess above that figure.From a date to be arranged a cut in fees will be made which, although appliedat varying rates to the different types of treatment, is expected to result in an overall saving of 20 per cent.For each million cases of treatment the existing cut is estimated to save 500,000, or 8^ per cent, of the total cost of  6 million; the proposed cut isestimated to save  1,200,000 or 20 per cent, of the cost. The saving effected by theproposed cut in fees will absorb most of the saving resulting from the existing cut.The present demand is at the rate of approximately 8 million cases perannum.2. Supplementary Ophthalmic ServicesReductions in fees have been made by agreement with the professions. Thereduction in fees for testing of sight date in part from 1st April, 1949, and inpart from 1st May, 1949; in dispensing fees the reductions take effect from 1st May.  &apos; .(a) Sight-testingThe ophthalmologists&apos; fee has been reduced by 6s. Qd. to 25s., while thatof the ophthalmic optician who also dispenses has been reduced in general byIs. Qd. to 14s.For 1 million cases the full saving is about  100,000, or nearly 1H of theformer cost of  875,000.(6) Dispensing and Supply of GlassesIn addition to an overall reduction of Is., the dispensing fee for a secondpair of glasses has been reduced to 10s.For 1 million cases, which on present information involves the supply of1,370,000 pairs of glasses, the anticipated saving is about  290,000, or 9 percent of the total cost of  3-2 million.
The savings on both (a) and (b) for 1 million cases is therefore estimatedat  390,000, or 9^ per cent, of the former cost of  4-07 miiiion.The present demand is at the rate of about 1\ million sight tests per annum.This would involve the supply of about 10 million pairs of glasses, but themaximum production for the next year is unlikely to exceed 6^ million pairs.3. Pharmaceutical Services (Chemists)Agreement has not yet been reached with the profession, but it is expectedthat the present average allowance of 1\d. per prescription for containers willbe reduced by \\d. per prescription, with effect from a date not earlier thanthe 1st July, 1949.For 1 million prescriptions the saving would amount to rather more than 5,000, or 4 per cent, of the total cost of  129,000.The estimated demand for a year is 180 million prescriptions.4. On the present scale of central purchase of medical supplies, for whicha net provision of  6,120,000 appears in the Estimates, it is estimated that thereis a saving of something over  2 million.The main saving is on hearing aids. We are getting these at about  4 a set,whereas the cheapest commercial set is at least  15 more (they were much dearerbefore the new scheme operated). The annual cost of batteries is also much reduced. With 100,000 sets a year there is a saving of  1,500,000. Other impor-tant items of saving are X-ray apparatus ( 250,000) and X-ray film ( 250,000).On current prices of streptomycin of 8s. per gramme central supply producesa saving of  60,000 a year.
