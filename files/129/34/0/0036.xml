&apos; Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1949SECRET   , copy no^    3CP. (49)10610th May, 1949 /L.^ :&apos;    &apos;&apos;.   &quot;V&apos;1&apos;&quot; f 1 &apos;&apos;-&apos;r&apos;l;m&apos;-v,&apos;&apos;i,V^;CABINET.. THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE...        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland &apos; n. 1. I find myself in the same position as the Minister of Health, obliged toreport that the money provided in the 1949-50 estimates for the National health service in Scotland is almost certainly inadequate to enable the;service to becarried on without restriction of facilities to the public. These estimates pro-;vide for gross expenditure of  39-6 million, which is  2-3 million less than thefigures quoted in my earlier paper (CP (48) 308), the difference being accountedfor1 mainly by cuts relating to the hospital and specialist service and to the dentalservice, which were suggested by the Treasury. &apos;1 ;&apos;;.: 2. There are two main reasons for the inadequacy of the estimates. Thefirst, which chiefly affects the general practitioner services and especially the dental service, is that demand has not receded as far as I had anticipated fromthe high level of the late autumn. In the dental service, cases involving dentures(arid these are the most expensive) are now coming in at the rate of half a million a year: this is only two-thirds of the rate last October, and I feel sure that itmust/fall further still. On the other hand, cases of conservative treatment arestill running nearly at the 750,000 a year level, and I do not think much decrease,if any, is to be looked for. In cutting the original estimate, I relied partly ona more rapid reduction of demand, and partly on the further reduction in thescale of fees, which cannot now be effective for much more than half the casescoming for payment this year. It is thus clear that the final estimate is wellshort of the mark, although at this early stage I cannot put a figure on the deficit.3. As regards the other general practitioner services, I think that, whilethe present claim by the doctors is seriously overstated, we shall be obliged to concede something to them : the family doctor, who is after all the foundation of the whole service, has in my opinion fared less well than almost any otherworker in the service. The cut in fees for oculists and opticians will, I hope,make it possible to keep very close to the estimated figure for the eye service :especially as the current demand (which is running at the rate of almost one million sight tests a year, 20 per cent, below the October peak) surely cannot bemaintained for another twelve months. Por the chemists, I am afraid myestimated provision is inadequate, even allowing for minor savings and pre-cautions against abuse. The volume of prescribing now seems -to have beenabnormally low at the start, and delays in making payments last year mean thatarrears have to be met in the current year.4. The difficulty in estimating the cost of the hospital and specialist services is not related so much to speculative assessments of demand as is thecost of the general practitioner services, but reliable figures of past experience in the hospital field have, as the Minister of Health points out, been very hard to obtain. I would like to emphasise that as the new hospital organisation settles37016fHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
down and the accounts come forward in a standard form for all hospitals, thehospital authorities and my Department will, for the first time, have preciseand detailed information on hospital expenditure. It will be possible to framenext year&apos;s estimates on the basis of firm figures; and equally important fromthe costing returns to detect and inquire into all exceptional rates of expenditure.5. Even so, the main items for which shortages are likely to appear; in&apos;this year&apos;s estimates are the items for salaries and wages of staff whose remuhera-tion has been improved by recent decisions. For nursing staff alone, the:improvements about to be effected will cost in Scotland nearly  1 million in thecurrent year. For student nurses, the recent increases granted after the estimateshad been framed will cost  \ million, and domestic staff increases associatedwith these improvements will cost another  \ million. We have had particular difficulty in assessing the cost of the specialist services, for the doctors concerned are only now being graded: but having regard especially to the need forretrospective payments in these cases right back to 5th July, I am afraid thatthe provision for this item is about  ^ million short.6. While it is not yet possible to frame really accurate forecasts of the totalexpenditure for the year, it is clear that increased charges of this order cannotbe met out of the original estimate without very substantial savings in other directions. These would involve not only suspension of maintenance and develop-ment work, but in all probability the closing of wards and dismissal of staff aswell. It is my firm view that we should not be afraid of capital expenditure onsuch items as redesign of working space and improved equipment in hospitals,which by. saving labour can pay their own way as well as provide better services for the patients. Similarly, capital expenditure on improved out-patient depart-ments would be an economy in the long run, for, given proper amenities at these places, the needs of many patients could be met without admitting them to muchmore costly in-patient care. Apart from these special cases, I think we shallhave to increase the volume of capital expenditure : we have taken over verylarge capital assets, and already there has been practically no replacement forten years. The present rate of expenditure is short of net replacement to say nothing of expansion.7. I&apos;therefore associate myself with the Ministers hope that our colleagues will agree to the provision of additional money, failing which we shall needguidance as to the services to be selected for curtailment.A.
