J 1^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TCP.(k10)&apos;983RD MAY. 19U9CABINETCOUNCIL OP EUROPE:    BRITISH REPRESENTATION.   IN CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Lord President of the council * In the light of the views expressed at the meeting ofthe Cabinet held on 2nd May (CM. (49) 31st Conclusions, Minute 1),I have discussed with the Chief Whip the arrangements which weshould make for choosing the 18 representatives to the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe to which we are entitled underArticle 26 of the draft Statute.2. I suggest that, for the first meeting of the Assembly,we should decide to divide representation between parties in proportion to their strength in the House of Commons.The draft Statute gives us one representative for approximatly every 36 members of the House of Commons;    and,if parties are to be represented in proportion to their strength in that House, the Government should have 11 representatives, the conservatives 6 representatives, and that leaves one &quot;representative in respect of the other members, including Liberals.     TheGovernment, we think, should not commit itself as to the mannerin which this final representative should be chosen, and if, forthe first meeting of the Consultative Assembly, the place is given tothe Liberal Party (which is not entitled to it on its ten members in the House of Commons) v/e should claim to have some say in themanner in which it uses its nomination.3. Most of the representatives should be drawn from theHouse of Commons, but in our view it should be open to us toinclude in the British delegation suitable members of theHouse of Lords.      Persons who are not in either House of parliament should not be nominated.     We should not regard members of either house of the Parliament of Northern Ireland as eligible.h. In informal discussions with the Opposition, it wouldseem to be reasonable to say that the Government will beprepared to consider the claims of Scotland and Wales in selecting its names, on condition that the Opposition will performa similar function in respect of Northern Ireland.     It should beremembered that the Irish Republic will be independently-represented.5. Article 25 of the draft Statute provides that representativesare to be &quot;appointed in such a manner as the Government of that member shall decide&quot; ana. there is also provision that eachrepresentative may have a substitute who &quot;may, in the absence ofthe representative sit, speak and vote in his place&quot;.  -  TheGovernment is empowered to decide on the manner in whichsubstitutes are appointed.2.COPY NO.   *-*

I suggest that -all the British representatives should formally he appointed by the Prime Minister, but thatIn practice the Prime Minister should not question the nominationsnade by the.Opposition.     In regard to substitutes, the Governmentshould make it clear that there can be no question of eachrepresentative having a substitute who would accompany him toStrasbourg.    The,Government and the Opposition should each preparei short list of substitutes, none of whom would leave thiscountry until a representative   had become unable to attendaeetings (Article 25(c)). or had been elected President (Article 28(b))). I suggest that the question whether Ministers should beincluded among the Government representatives should be left over   -intil the Opposition list of nominations has been received by the3rime Minister.1. The preliminary announcement in Parliament   -on t hesubject of representation should, I suggest, be confined to astatement that the Opposition will be included in the british representation to the Consultative Assembly and that most of therepresentatives will be members of the House of Commons but thatnembers of the House of Lords may also be included.     On thequestions what proportions of the British representation will)e drawn from the Government and Opposition sides of the House,)n Liberal representation and on the representation of Scotland,!/ales and Northern Ireland, I suggest that, at this stage the answer should be that these matters are being examined and that my representations should be made through the usual channels.5. .     m order to assist  ther Governments with considerablefascist or Communist elements in their Parliaments, we shouldpublicly state that we do not regard parties which are anti-democratic)r opposed to the objects of Western Union (set out in Article 3)f the draft Statute)  as eligible for inclusion in the british representation.H.M.Dffice of the Lord President of the Council3RD MAY, 1949.
