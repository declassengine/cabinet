THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1949SECRET Copy Me. 31CP. (49) 828th April, 1949CABINETLOCAL government memorandum by the Minister of health i ask my colleagues to approve the appointment of a Royal Commission toconsider and report on the functions and structure of local government in Englandand Wales, including London.2. Some preliminary discussion on this question took place at the meetingof the Lord Presidents Committee on 4th March i(L.P. (49) ;5th Meeting, Minute 2)in relation to the work of -the Local Government Boundary Commission (L.P. (49)16 refers). The report of the Commission for 1948 has now been received andwill be published within a month or so.3. Although this report does not in itself raise any major issues, its publication will inevitably draw further attention both to questions of localgovernment policy and to the future of the Commission, and I think it is important that before !the report is published we should make up our minds as to the courseof action to be taken by the Government during the next year or ,so.4. As my colleagues are aware, in their report for 1947 the Commissionersmade far-reaching recommendations for alteration of the structure and functionsof local authorities. The main local government associations have said littleabout this report, but I have no doubt that there would (be strong opposition toany proposal to give effect to these recommendations on the strength of a reportof a small executive body appointed for a limited purpose who have made recom-mendations on a Wide issue without hearing evidence, and I would not recommendany action on these lines unless and until :it were supported by a more authoritativebody.5. On the other hand, I do not think that it is possible to leave the reportsat large over the next year without any indication of any Government action oreven of their attitude on the general question of local government reform.6. Public talk and writing on this question for many years have accepted as an axiom that local government requires a radical reform and that the needfor this reform is urgent.7. I think the argument as to urgency has been exaggerated : local govern-ment exists for the purpose of discharging certain services for the inhabitants of the district, not for the purpose of providing a tidy picture. Although the structure of local government is illogical and untidy, I believe that within itspresent structure it can and does discharge these services with general efficiency and that there is no question of administrative breakdown. Certainly no G-overn-ment reconstruction proposals have been hampered by local government untidiness.8. Nevertheless, since the present structure was created mainly in the last century, a great many changes have been made in the functions assigned to localgovernment: many new functions have been assigned, some functions have beenredistributed as between different types of local government, and some functionshave been transferred from local government to the Central Government or to36861
public corporations. Under the present Government, hospitals, gas, electricity and transport have been dealt with in this way, and it is our intention to extend this process to water.9. I should, therefore, be prepared to find that a review of the position which took account of the substantial changes in the functions of local authorities would call for a substantial change in their structure. Any proposals of this kind are bound to be highly controversial, and I do not think that we ought to commit ourselves to any such change of structure or that we should express views as towhat this change ought to be until we have had a review of the position by. an authoritative body which would make recommendations after taking evidence.Even if such a body failed to make unanimous recommendations the Governmentwould be in a stronger position for taking such action as they considered necessary,for the facts of the position, and the inability both of local government and of tneCommission to agree on the action to be taken, would have been fully exposed.10. Views on local government to a very large extent cut across partyaffiliations and it seems to me important that discussion, legislation and its immediate operation should be detached as far as possible from the complicationsof a general election. For this reason it would be undesirable for the LocalGovernment Boundary Commission to make any specific boundary proposals sonear to the coming election and, of course, any legislation on this question oughtto be in the first or second year of a Government. If a Royal Commission were appointed forthwith it should be possible to secure a report to enable legislation to be prepared and introduced within this time.11. I suggest, therefore, that a Royal Commission should be appointedwithout delay, that the Commission should be asked to review the whole structure of local government on the assumption that local government is to continue todischarge the whole of the functions at present entrusted to it (with the exceptionof water), and to make recommendations as to how. the local government functionsshould be discharged, and as to the size of various local government wards. TheCommission should be asked to report by the end of 1950.   The setting up of aI Royal Commission would, of course, mean the suspension of the activities of the1 Local Government Boundary Commission.12. I consider a Royal Commission preferable to a Ministerial or official committee, for it is almost inevitable that it would become known that we werediscussing local government reform. The local government world would be stirredup and we should be asked embarrassing questions before we were ready to answer.A. B.Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S.W. 1,8th April, 1949.
