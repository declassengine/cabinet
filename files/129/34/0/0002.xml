The information in the reports is in the form, where applicable, ofanswers to the following questionnaire : Is there a legal Communist Party?What is its actual membership?What is its percentage of the total population? .What is its percentage of the electorate?Has it members in the national Parliament, and what percentage?Has it members in the national Government?What votes has it recorded in recent elections, national or local?What is the extent of its influence in the armed forces?What is the extent of its influence in the police?What is the extent of its influence in the Civil Service?What is the extent of its influence in the trade unions?Are there any known contacts between its leaders and Soviet Russia?Are there any known contacts between its leaders and Communists in neighbouring countries?What are its potentialities as a fifth-column?
france. The Communist Party in France is legal. It is, in fact, the largest singleparty in the elected Chamber, the Assemblee Nationale (Lower House), andtherefore it is unlikely that, short of a war with Russia or a near catastrophicsituation leading to a dissolution and a de Gaulle &quot; dictatorship &quot; the legality of the Party will be questioned.Under the stress of war conditions, it is true, the Party was outlawedon 26th September, 1939, by the Daladier Government, which ordered its dissolution-tion with the concurrence of the other groups represented in the Chambre desDeputes. At the same time the Government placed a ban on the publication anddistribution of all Communist propaganda material.2. Membership of the Party. Figures of the actual membership of theParty, as distinct from the Communist-controlled C.G.T., are not easily available.At the end of 1946 the estimated figure was 815,000 approximately. It is possiblethat the figure of militants to-day (the end of 1948) has decreased somewhat.There are, of course, several welfare and charitable organisations of a &quot; fellow-traveller &quot; character controlled by Communists, and a small section of the SocialistParty (S.F.I.O.) might, in certain circumstances, co-operate actively with theP.C.F. (Parti Communiste Franoais). During January 1949 the Union republic-caine et Resistante, numbering eight Deputies, and affiliated to the Communists,have decided to act as a separate party, with possibly a less intransigent policy.3.   Percentage of the Electorate. 28-2 per cent, (see 6 infra).4. Number of Members in the Assemblee, Nationale is 168 out of a totalof 621 Deputies. In the Conseil de la Republique (Upper House), the party&apos;srepresentation has been cut down during the recent elections of November 1948from 84 (out of 315), councillors to 21 (out of 320). The decrease is, however,largely due to the substitution of a majority vote for P.R. in many electoraldistricts, an alteration which penalised the Communists who were unwilling toform electoral alliances. They still probably control about 20 per cent, of the electorate, but a change in the electoral system might reduce their representation in the Assembly also.5. Communist Ministers were bowed out of the quadripartite coalition government of M. Ramadier in May 1947, when Communist Deputies, includingthe Ministers, chose to vote against the Government on economic policy and aisoon the Governments policy in Indo-China. In the present Government underthe Constitution, the Communists would be offered posts in a caretaker Govern-ment, formed after dissolution of the National Assembly until a new assembly is elected. / \ ...6. Voting strength in the general election of November 1946 was 5,475,955(Metropolitan France only). Overall results of thejnunicipal elections of October1947 gave the Communists no more than 6-9 per cent, of the seats. At thesecond ballot, in many cases, they forfeited nearly 25 per cent, of their municipalcouncillorships and a majority of the mairies previously held by Communists.7. Influence in the Armed Forces. In the first two and a half years afterthe Liberation the Communists exerted considerable influence in the armed forces.This was due partly to the prominent position they had acquired during the resistance period, partly to the strong position they occupied then in the political system. It has to be borne in mind that, in the coalition Governments to which France appeared to be committed indefinitely by the electoral law, Ministriesare largely party strongholds. General de Gaulle&apos;s coalition Governments, theGouin and Bidault Administrations of 1946, as well as the quadripartite coalition,after the general elections of November 1946, all contained Communist Ministersthrough whose influence Communists were infiltrated into key-positions.M. Tillon, Minister of Armaments, was able to secure control over the arsenals.But the extrusion of Communist Ministers from the Ramadier Government inMay 1947 put a very different complexion on the matter. To-day, while Communistagents are perhaps more active than ever in their attempts to gain a hold overthe serving soldier by propaganda the Central Committee of the Party is knownto attach great importance to propaganda in the forces which is under the chargeof M. Raoul Galas Communist influence in the direction of Armed Forces, Army,
Navy or Air Force has been reduced considerably. It should be noted, however,that scientific and armament research, and production are penetrated by avowedCommunists, an outstanding example being that of Professor Joliot-Curie, incharge of Atomic Research.8. Influence in the Police. In the immediate post-war period, similarly,Communists held many important positions in the police. But recent Governments,with Communists excluded, have been able to effect considerable &quot; purging &quot; y.i.e., pensioning off of persons who obtained high appointments, outside the normalhierarchy, at the time of the Liberation. To-day, even in the Paris police,Communists are probably not much more than 20 per cent.9. Influence in the Civil Service. The same trajectory is to be observed.But the strength of Communist influence in the civil service is still substantial,particularly in the nationalised industries, although efforts have been made inthe departments, especially the Ministry of Labour, to prevent Communistsholding important posts.10. Influence in the Trade Unions. The principal trade union federation,the C.G.T., Confederation Generale dn Travail, -which is Communist-controlled,numbers some 2,500,000, although this figure may have been considerably reducedby the violent tactics adopted by CP. during the miners&apos; strike, which alienatedmany workers. Communist representation is strong on the joint factorycommittees which are compulsory in all enterprises employing more than50 workers. Since December last year, when the failure of the strikes showed that the rank-and-file of French workers were &quot;fed up&quot; with being draggedinto political agitation, Communist leaders have done their utmost to revive theso-called &quot; Communist fractions &quot; in the trade unions. But they have not beenaltogether successful. Communist influence in the trade unions, while it willcontinue strong, has probably passed its meridian. An estimate by M. Bennoit-Frachon, Secretary-General of the C.G.T., early in 1948 that the number of payingmembers of the C.G.T. would shortly be in the region of five million is a sheerflight of fancy.11. Contacts between French Communist Leaders and Soviet Russia. Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the Communist Party since before the War,is Moscow-trained and is reported to have got on particularly well with Stalin.He spent some years in Russia during the War, after deserting from the french army. While he does his best to follow the party line e.g., the noticeable shift of tactics following the &quot; Cominform&quot; meeting in September 1947, of which hisspeeqh on 29th October at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Party wasthe reflection he is said to have snown rather too much independent spirit tobe completely in the good grace of the Kremlin. Other leaders more under thethumb of Moscow like MM. Marty and Casanova have nothing like the prestigeor ability of Thorez.12. Contacts with Leaders in Neighbouring Countries. There is no evidencethat French Communist Party leaders depend from day to day or week to week on instructions from Moscow. In the recent coal strike, December 1948, thereappear, however, good grounds for assuming that they were being both advisedand subsidised by Moscow. They are well trained-and there is always theRussian press and wireless. Some attempt was made late 1948 to synchronisetactics and developments with the Italian Communist Party, and in late NovemberTogliatti was thought to have visited France to &quot; check up &quot; on the possibilityof relating military and sabotage operations in South-Eastern France with similardevelopments in North-West Italy; but on the whole, the French Communist party has few links with other Communist Parties except, of course, through member-ship of the Cominform. At times Moscow seeks to use the French CommunistParty as the main outpost of Communism in Western Europe e.g., for directivesto the parties in the Low Countries.13. Military Organisation of the Party.-As to the potentialities of theP.C.F. as a &quot;Fifth Column,&quot; exaggerated ideas are held on this. The best estimate of underground military strength is between 100,000 and 150,000. Ofthose who vote &quot; Communist &quot; in the elections not all would, in fact, in the eventof a war between the Soviet Union and the West, go out and fight for, or indeedgive any sort of aid to, Soviet Russia. But the probability of effective &quot;fifth column&quot; activities should not be lightly dismissed.   In an all-out efforth the
Communist Party could dislocate national life for a period and achieve an effective if only temporary stoppage of any war effort.In a country like France with a long-standing political tradition it is incon-ceivable that the electoral strength of the Communist Party should indicate thatthe nation is hell-bent for a journey along the Moscow road. It is an importantfact, however, which should never be overlooked, that the Communist Party has established itself firmly in France as the workers&apos; party (particularly but notexclusively industrial workers), supplanting the S.F.I.O., which, after supportinga series of coalition Governments, has abandoned in some measure the traditionalprinciples of French socialism, and thus compromised itself with many of theworking class. Whatever happens in the Parliamentary arena, this position is unlikely to change: this &quot;Labourism,&quot; which gives French Communism itsI. Yes.   The Communist Party is legal.2. Membership of the Party. 100,000 at the beginning of 1948 (108,000 inSeptember 1945: 10,000 before the war). The Party machine is undergoingthorough overhaul, necessitated by this ten-fold expansion; and it^was hoped to recruit 5,000 branch secretaries by the end of 1948. These, in turn, were expectedto recruit some 50,000 &quot; militants surs et devoues.&quot; Of the present Party total,it is almost certain that an appreciable number have not paid their dues.3. Percentage of Total Population. 1 - 2 per cent, (the population is approximately 8,300,000).4. Percentage of the Electorate. Electorate figure unknown; but the Partypolled 12-7 per cent, of the total votes-2,365,638 cast at the General election of February 1946.5. Representation in Parliament. 23 Deputies in the Chamber of Repre-sentatives (9 before the war) out of a total of 202, or 11-4 per cent.; and17 Senators in the Senate (3 before the war) out of a total of 167, or 10-2 per cent.6. Membership of Government. Not since M. Spaak took office with aChristian Social-Socialist coalition in March 1947. The left-wing Cabinet ofhis predecessor, M. Huysmans, included 4 Communists. The present Cabinet,formed by M. Spaak in November 1948, retains its two-party basis.7. Voting Strength. 300,099 votes were polled for Communist candidatesat the General Election of February 1946.8.   Influence in the A rmed Forces. No evidence of any influence.9.   Influence in the Police. Very small influence perhaps negligible.10. Influence in the Civil Service. Unknown; but the impression is thatit is inconsiderable.II. Influence in Trade Unions. Communist penetration of Trade Unions,*   previously estimated to be about 30 per cent., has since declined considerably.There is no Communist influence whatsoever in the Christian (Catholic) TradeUnion Confederation; and present strength of Communism in the (Socialist)Belgian Confederation of Labour is estimated at not more than 15 per cent, oftotal membership. As the result of determined efforts to deny them influentialpositions, Communists now hold no places either on the National Secretariat oron the General Council. Only five of the numerous Communist Unions (Syndicatsuniques) formed during the occupation continue to exist. All are affiliated tothe Belgian Federation of Labour. With the exception of the Quarrymen&apos;sSyndicat unique, their influence is small. In the other Unions of the BelgianFederation of Labour, a few subordinate official posts are held by Communists.This is a concession to the principle of Trade Union unity; but, in any case, theseCommunist officials are under continuous supervision by reliable Socialists. the systematic elimination of Communists from official posts in the Metalworkers&apos;Union and the Public Services Federation the two largest Unions affiliated tothe Federation of Labour has much reduced the Party&apos;s influence in them.   ItBELGIUM
was in these two Unions that, not very long ago, Communist influence was greatest.These setbacks in the Trade Unions have not, however, dissuaded them from taking every opportunity to make capital out of the workers&apos; grievances. It isknown that during 1948 the Party was instructed to begin immediate infiltrationof the building and electrical industries (including power-stations), using themethods which proved so successful in Czechoslovakia. Those engaged in these activities were issued with a document known as Le Cornet de V Homme deConfiance, which is believed to be identical with a document issued to militantsin Czechoslovakia. Infiltration of other industries was also to begin; but so farthese have not been specified.12. Contacts between Belgian Communist Leaders and Soviet Russia&apos;. -Unknown.13. Contacts with Leaders in Neighbouring Countries-There was ameeting on 4th January, 1948, between two members of the Central Committeeof the Belgian Communist Party Julien Lahaut, President of the Party, andJean Bertrand, National Secretary and an unnamed delegate from the FrenchCommunist Party. The meeting was held for the purpose of planning concerted action in the event of international conflict; and it is believed.that the selection of points along the Franco-Belgian frontier at which French or alien Communist&quot; refugees &quot; could enter Belgium secretly and form a maquis on the Belgian side,and the question of supplies for the proposed maquis, were among the subjects discussed.14. Military Organisation of the Party. While there is some sign of para-military activity, the Belgian authorities are of the opinion, that the BelgianCommunist Party is not in a position to initiate any revolutionary action in thenear future. Early in 1948, however, French and Belgian Communist elementswere reported to be smuggling arms and explosives by rail from France to belgium. Of the former Resistance groups, the Communist-dominated Front deVIndependance remains the most highly organised and most vocal; it is not known whether it is armed.THE NETHERLANDS1. The Communist Party is legal. (Established in 1909.) It is calledCommunistische Parti] Nederland (CP.,N.).2. Party leaders announced the membership as 53,000 on 1st September, 1947.A recent estimate suggests that it has fallen to about 50,000.3.   Membership represents about .54 per cent, of the total population.4. Total of electorate 5,444,735 (July 1948). Communist poll at the GeneralElection of July 1948 was 7 - 74 per cent, of a total poll of 4,933,735 (10 - 6 per cent,of a total poll of 4,760,711 in May 1946).5. There are eight members in the Second (Lower) Chamber out of 100, or8 per cent. (10 in May 1946; 3 before the war).6.   No Communist has ever served in a Dutch Cabinet.7. The Party polled 381,953 votes at the General Election of July 1948(502,963 in May 1946).8. Influence in Armed Forces is believed to be nil. Unsuccessful attemptswere made by the Communist Party to persuade troops to desert on the eve of their departure for the Netherlands East Indies in 1946.9.   Influence in the Police is believed to be very small.10.   There is no information as to influence in the Civil Service.li. At one time Communist penetration of the trade unions was estimated at about 30 per cent.; but recently the Party has lost much ground even in the so-called &quot; Unity Trade Union,&quot; which it founded soon after the war and which itdominates. This union hoped to capture waverers and malcontents from the powerful Catholic and Socialist Unions, but in this it was mainly unsuccessful;although-until the coup in Czechoslovakia its ranks included a certain number
of left-wing Socialist elements and others. These have since broken away and thestrength of the Unity Union is now principally derived from the Rotterdam andAmsterdam dock-workers, who, in any case, provided its original membership.The Communist trade-union strength has recently been estimated at 100-120,000as against 850,000 in the non-Communist unions.12. The General Secretary of C.P.N., Paul de Groot, visited Russia in 1935and 1946; the Secretary, Johannes Pieter Schalker, visited Russia before 1940, andthe second Secretary, Jan Halken, travelled through the Soviet Zone of germany in 1947 and attended the S.E.D. Congress in Berlin. Paul de. Groot attended theCommunist Party Congress in England in 1947 and Jan Halken the FrenchCommunist Congress in the same year. Dockers&apos; delegates from Rotterdamand Antwerp met in Belgium in October 1947 to discuss the means of defeating asecret agreement reached between the shipping companies in these two parts forunloading ships in one port in the event of the others being paralysed by a strike.(The only serious strikes in the Netherlands since the war have involved dockers.)13. Dockers&apos; delegates from Rotterdam and Antwerp met in Belgium inOctober 1947 to discuss the means of defeating a secret agreement reached betweenthe shipping companies in these two ports for unloading ships in one port in theevent of the other&apos;s being paralysed by a strike. (The only serious strikes in theNetherlands since the war have involved dockers.)14. The dock workers might prove troublesome in case of a conflict withRussia.   Isolated acts of sabotage might also occur.GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURGI. The Communist Party is legal.2.   There is no information regarding its actual membership.3. See 2 above. (The total population on 31st December, 1947, was 286,786, -with some 4,000 persons still out of the country owing to the war.)4. Total of electorate unknown. (In any case, election figures in luxembourg -bourg are very misleading owing to the system of plural voting, as well as propor-tional representation, employed, which often gives the various parties a pollappreciably in excess of the country&apos;s population. As an additional complication,half the Chamber is elected every three years.)5. There are five Communist members in the Chamber (none before the war)out of fifty-one, or 9-8 per cent. (The last General Election was held in October1945, when, for the first time, Communists were elected. A partial election,affecting the southern half of the country, took place in June 1948, when four ofthe five Communist seats were contested; but there was no change.)6. There was a Communist Minister of Health in the first post-war Cabinet(of &quot; National Union &quot;). He died in office, and was replaced by another Com-munist, who held the portfolio until the Cabinefs fall in March 1947, since when there have been no Communist appointments.7. No information regarding Communist votes: cf. A above. But, in the partial election already mentioned (June 1948), the Party is known to have lostabout 15 per cent, of its votes to the Socialists.8.-10. No information has been received regarding Communist influence inthe Armed Forces, the police or the Civil Service.II. At the beginning of 1945 Socialists and Communists separated to formindependent unions. Communist membership was then about 16,000, Socialistabout 5,500. By the end of 1948, however, Socialist membership had risen to about12,000 (exclusive of railwaymen), while Communist membership had fallen to about10,000 perhaps lower. If railwaymen be added (these, in the case of Com-munists, are represented by a small number of &quot; fellow-travellers &quot;), the grandtotals are : Socialists, 18,000; Communists, 10,350. The steel industry, the mostimportant in Luxembourg, has, of course, the largest membership 10,000Socialists and 8,500 Communists. The Cabinefs policy of pegging wages is aparticular grievance with railwaymen, whose almost exclusively Socialist Union
has apparently forbidden strike action. Although this has been a disappointmentto the Communists, they are making every effort to foment unrest among railway-mem and are devoting one page a week of their paper, D&apos;Zeitung, in attempts to convince railwaymen that their interests are being mishandled by the Socialists.12. Although there is no definite proof of contacts with the Soviet Union,it is strongly suspected that the Party is receiving financial aid through the medium of the Soviet Embassies in Paris and Brussels, without which the Partyorgan, D&apos;Zeitung, would have been unable to continue to appear. As it is,.D&apos;Zeitung has recently been conducting a door-to-door canvass for subscriptions-Lists are prepared, which are presented to shopkeepers, caf  proprietors andothers, who are invited either to subscribe or to take out an insurance for thefuture. Waverers are told, in veiled terms, that the time might come when theymight have reason to regret their refusal to subscribe. It is reported that this threat has proved moderately successful. (Subscription to D&apos;Zeitung is a condi-tion of actual Party membership.)13.-14. No information is available regarding contacts with Communists in neighbouring countries, or of the possibility of a nucleus being formed for fiftitcolumn activities.SPAINIn Spain the Communist Party is an illegal and clandestine body, existing-precariously under the ever watchful eye of the Franco police. The headquarters of the Party is in France, where its Executive Committee (under the Secretary-General, Dolores Ibarruri) works in close touch with the French Communist party and through the latter has contact with the Russian Central Communist Party.There have, of course, been no free parliamentary elections since the civil war. Before the advent of the Republic in 1931 the Communist Party wasinsignificant and was not represented in the Cortes. Indeed, the first and secondParliaments of the Republic 1931 and 1933-each contained only one CommunistDeputy (not the same person); and it was not until the Popular Front Governmentin 1936 that the Communist Party, by previous arrangement between the parties,was allotted sixteen seats.At the.time of the Popular Front Government it was estimated that therewere in Spain about 50,000 Communists. The number was probably much largerby the end of,the civil war. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Madrid reported on 7th January, 1947, that the estimated number of Communists at that time was again 50,000. He reported, also, that there were definite signs that the party was gaining ground in Andalusia, Extremadura and the south of Spain generally(agricultural areas), though this was not so in other regions, where the CommunistParty could count only on a small minority of the workers. A more recent report,dated May 1948, confirmed that the strength of the Communist Party in the twoindustrial areas, the Basque Provinces and Catalonia, was in the first casenegligible and in the second not much stronger.It seems fairly certain, however, that individual Communists have infiltratedinto the ranks of the clandestine political organisations such as the U.G.T. (theSocialist trade union) and the C.N.T. (the Anarchist trade union). The Com-munists have also made a definite attempt to secure control of the guerrillas, to-unify them and to use them as Communist shock troops. The guerrillas havethree main centres, in southern, central and north-west Spain, which receiveguidance from Toulouse, where many of the leaders have received preliminarytraining in sobatage, &amp;c, before infiltrating into Spain. Despite intensive efforts to recruit more guerrillas, however, the numbers and activities of the latter have decreased, and clandestine Communist propaganda is no more than intermittentas a result of effective police action. Judging from the scope and appeal of itspropaganda and the acts of terrorism which it perpetrates and there is atpresent no other mode of assessment-the potential effectiveness of the presentCommunist force as a fifth column would not be so great as to constitute a seriousmenace, whilst the present regime continues, though its nuisance value could, ifnecessary, be considerably expanded.O
PORTUGALThere is in Portugal a small, well-organised and disciplined CommunistParty of some 250 to 500 members. It is an illegal and clandestine party,operating under extreme difficulty. Its original founder, Jose de Souza, was sentto Tarrafal penal settlement in the Cape Verde Islands many years ago andreleased under the 1945 amnesty, returning to Portugal. (He is reported to have become disillusioned with the Party.) Dr. Alvaro Cunhal, one of the presentleaders, was reported to have recently paid a visit to Moscow. The Party isthought to have affiliations with the Brazilian organisation, the MovimentoUnificador dos Trabalhadores, which in turn is said to be subsidised from Russia.The Portuguese police attributed the rather un-Portuguese efficiency in thedirection of the strikes in the Lisbon dockyards in April 1947 to foreign influence.-There has been evidence of Government disquiet at the underground activitiesof the Communist Party. A communique issued on 24th April, 1948, allegedCommunist penetration of the anti-Government parties grouped in the M.U.D.(Movement of Democratic Unity), a respectable organisation grouping elements in opposition to Dr. Salazar&apos;s Government. The names of some.47 persons weregiven who were said to have confessed to belonging both to the M.U.D. and theCommunist Party. Many of the liberal elements in M.U.D. were shocked by therevelation and left the organisation. In August some 107 persons were tried ona charge of subversive activities on behalf of the Communist Party; 39 wereacquitted and the rest sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment. the prosecution appealed against the sentences, but no record of any subsequentdevelopment has been seen.italy. There is a legal Communist Party.2. Membership on 15th December, 1947 : 2,330,887*3. Percentage of the 1947 Population: 5.4. Percentage of the Electorate : 8 - 2.5. Number of Members of the Chamber of Deputies Communist Party : 132, 23 per cent.Pro-Communist Socialist: Up to 48.Number of Members of the Senate : 66, 19 per cent.6.   Members in the National Government: None.7. Votes recorded in the National Elections of 18th April 1948 : 5- 9 milliontapproximately.8. Influence in the A rmed Forces. Since the expulsion of the Extreme Leftfrom the Government, the latter has attempted to purge its influence from the armed Forces (including Carabinieri) and the General Staff is now confidentthis purge has been sufficiently well carried out to ensure against disloyalty in anemergency. Conditions of service are being improved. The P.C.I. is, nevertheless,still on the watch for opportunities to penetrate and disrupt the loyalty of the armed Forces, in particular by attacks on the officer class and certain senior officers, and by agitation through the C.G.I.L. designed to create dissatisfaction with conditions of service, pensions, &amp;c.9. Influence in the Police. A similar purge has been carried out in thePublfca Sicurezza, involving not less than 13,000 out of a total of 70,000; itsloyalty is also considered sound. Certain categories of local police are dependenton municipal administrations, which in some cases are under Communist domina-tion, but they are not trained or equipped to suppress public disorders.* 2,330,887 was the number of membership cards announced at the Party Congress, Milan,January 1948.  An independent source gave the number as only 1,200,000.t The exact number of votes received by the Communist Party is not known. Votesreceived by the Popular Front (Communists and Nenni Socialists together) were 8,025,990. of popular Front seats in the Chamber, 132 are held by Communists: the.votes have been divided inthe same proportion as the seats.
10. Influence in the Civil Service.-Communists introduced into government offices while the Communist Party was in the Government have largely been removed, and though an appreciable number still remain, Communists&apos; attemptsduring October to exploit by strike action the lower Civil Serviced legitimateeconomic grievances had little success. Pronouncements by leading Party memberssuggest, however, that the Civil Service is considered an important objective forCommunist penetration, and that attempts to foment discontent will not be abandoned. The strike of Government employees on 20th December was only partially carried out in spite of a genuine economic grievance.11. Influence in the Trade Unions-The Communists dominate the ItalianGeneral Confederation of Labour, more particularly since the secession of the christian Democrat Trade Union leaders in July 1948. The Socialists of bothtendencies, and the Republicans, remain within the C.G.I.L. and exercise amoderating influence. The Mechanical Engineering Confederation is Communist-controlled, and is more disciplined than the Confederation of agricultural workers, which is also controlled by the Communists. The Italian Free GeneralConfederation of Workers (L.C.G.I.L.) initiated in September 1948 is anti-/Communist, and although open to all parties and beliefs, is mainly supported&apos;by Christian Democrats. Its strength has still to be assessed, but appears tobe growing. Apart from the Mechanical Engineering Federation, the workersin Italy are not well disciplined in Trade Union matters, and are as susceptible to economic and fear motives as to political issues.12. Contacts between P.C.I. and Soviet Union. Regular conferences-be tween P.C.I. leaders arid Soviet Embassy officials do not appear to be held,nor, so far as is known, do Embassy officials give direct instructions to the P.C.I.On the other hand it is reported that instructions to the P.C.I. from the RussianCommunist Party are transmitted via the Soviet Embassy, from where theyare normally collected by Togliatti&apos;s personal private secretary. Visits of P.C.I.leaders to the Soviet Embassy are reported to be few, though Togliatti&apos;s wife and Giuliano Pajetta are said to be fairly frequent callers. Contacts betweenTogliatti himself and Soviet officials in Italy are reported to be infrequent, in contrast to the practice up to about 1946. The Soviet Ambassador was reportedto have held conferences with Togliatti in Party Headquarters before and afterthe April elections. No visits of leading Italian Communists to Moscow have come to light, though Nenni (P.S.I.) was there on a short visit in the autumn.During the spring and summer Giuliano Pajetta in Belgrade, Reale in Warsaw,and Togliatti and Secchia in Roumania, had contact with Russian Communistofficials in connection with Cominform business.13. Known Contacts with Communist Parties elsewhere. At the meetingsreferred to in the last sentence of paragraph 12 above contacts were undoubtedlyriiade with some, and in the case of the meeting in Roumania, all the CommunistParties adhering to the Cominform (excepting, in the last case, the YugoslavCommunist Party). An unconfirmed report states that Di Vittorio, the TradeUnion leader, conferred with leading French Communists in Paris in the autumn :a more reliable report states that a representative of the French OCT. is holdingregular conferences in Rome with P.C.I. leaders on the co-ordination of French,and Italian Communist policy with regard to strikes and agitations. Reale isalso reported to have attended a meeting of the French Communist Party&apos;s Inter-national Policy Committee in Paris in April. The P.C.I. also sent delegates tothe Congresses of the Belgian and Swedish Communist Parties in May, Spanogoing to Brussels and Donini to Stockholm. It is reported independently that relations between representatives of satellite Communist Parties in Italy andthe P.C.I. have been growing closer since the formation of the Cominform (thoughrelations between satellite diplomatic missions as such are said to be discouraged by the Russians). It is reliably reported that at the beginning of 1948 direct contact was started between the Polish Embassy and the P.C.I.: the P.C.I. issaid to have provided the Embassy with good information on Italian industry,and to assist with propaganda among Polish D.P.s. In January 1949, M. Cachin,the French Communist leader, visited and spoke in various Italian townsemphasising the U.S.S.R.&apos;s policy of peace and collaboration.14.   Fifth-Column Potentialities. -These are very difficult to assess in a country where the holding of a Communist Party &quot;membership card does not36805 c 2
necessarily imply strong Party convictions.   At the broadest the Communistscan count on perhaps 6 million votes, but only one-third, and perhaps even less,are members of the Party. Of these in turn only a comparatively small proportioncan be trained and prepared in an emergency to commit themselves beyondcompromise to real insurrectional action, and the strength of this group would depend on a large number of imponderables, e.g., promptness of Government action,direct foreign military support, &amp;c.  On any calculation it is clear, however, that without being able to put an organised force into the field, the Communists couldnevertheless cause serious trouble from the purely military point of view, and through the Trades Unions which they control hamstring the country&apos;s war effort by. strikes and sabotage.   Small arms are available in great quantities, but itis unlikely that the Communists could, in fact, mobilise as many as the 245,000men with rifles and a high proportion of automatics, &amp;c, which was the ItalianGeneral Staffs estimate of Communist strength at the time of the elections. Thesepotential fighting groups consist largely of ex-partisans, who, despite the Govern-menfs measures of last February against para-military bodies, have retainedtheir local cadres, and organisation.   At the time of the elections the ForeignOffice estimated that the number which could be raised at short notice as amilitary formation would not exceed 40,000. There has been no later informationeither to support or refute this figure.   The Government has had some success in bringing to light Communist store of arms.   It is reported that the PartyDirectorate has agreed on the need to reorganise its undergound Military forces and to entrust this reorganisation to Signor Longo, the leader of the nationalisticand hotheaded elements in the Party.15. The Present Situation. The Communist Party received a serioussetback in the National Elections in April from which it hopes to recover byintensifying the political education of its weaker members and strengtheningleadership of local Communist organisations rather than by &quot;purging&quot; themto make a small and more reliable body. In the face of the increased strengthof the forces of law and order the Party is unlikely to attempt to seize power by violence, except as part of a broader scheme involving perhaps an invasion of the north-east frontier, though the events following the attempt on Togliatti&apos;slife showed that the Government^ margin of safety was less than had been thought. It is probable that the P.C.I. will (as it has been at pains to convincepublic opinion) work to broaden its grip on the country and strengthen itsparliamentary position by constitutional means, i.e., through alliances with otheranti-Government elements and through constant labour agitation. The latter,however, will probably be designed to strike a balance between the demands ofthe Cominform for co-ordinated labour agitation to wreck E.R.P. and the riskof alienating popular sympathy by causing undue distress among a working-classill-equipped to sustain lengthy strike periods (as occurred last winter). Duringthe last two months of 1948 there were a number of strikes including that ofGovernment employees on 20th December, but emphasis has been rather on whatthe Italians call non-co-operation, i.e., ca&apos;canny methods. The first results ofthis Communist policy should be seen in the communal elections scheduled forSpring 1949. Since the demise of the Popular Front, Communist propaganda has emphasised the P.C.I.&apos;s willingness to co-operate with any &quot;truly democratic &quot;forces. The &quot; pact of united action &quot; witn the P.S.I. has thus been kept in force,and mention has been made of a &quot;Democratic Alliance&quot; which, however, hasnot so far taken any concrete form. The Communists&apos; present reliance on a moderate policy can naturally be reversed overnight.TRIESTEThe attack of the Cominform on Tito in June 1948 resulted in a neworientation of the Trieste Communist Party. Up till that time it had been pro-Slav, and although officially autonomous it was in fact a branch of the YugoslavCommunist Party. The Cominform onslaught was immediately followed by asplit on national lines between the Italian Communists led by Vittorio Vidali,who adopted a policy of &quot; unconditional solidarity with the Communist Partieswhich adhere to the Cominform,&quot; and the Slav Communists led by the SloveneBabic, who was at that time secretary of the Party and also Secretary of the Italo-Slav Anti-Fascist Union (U.A.I.S.).   A general Congress of the Party
-was called on 21st and 22nd August and a new Central Committee and Executive-appointed consisting of Cominform supporters. The Vidali group is much thelarger of the two and controls the daily II Lavoratore and the Sindacati Uniciin the United Kingdom/United States Zone, but was for some time hard pressedfinancially as Babic had control of the Party funds. Its finances were, however,assured after a visit made by the Party leaders in October to Rome, which hasnow taken over the role of banker of Belgrade.The Communist Party, while now itself violently nationalistic, is nowconstantly bringing fierce accusations of nationalism against the Slav Communists.A great deal of the time of the Party Congress in August was spent in indiet-inents of the policy followed in Trieste by the Yugoslavs from the time whenthey took control of the local Communist Party and the Working Class Movementin general during the winter of 1943.In September the new Executive of the Italo-Slav Anti-Fascist Union wasselected, and former Slav members were eliminated, with the result that theTito Communists are almost excluded from Party activities in the UnitedKingdom/United States Zone. On the other hand, there has been a purge ofCommformists in the Yugoslav Zone, which caused bitter attacks in II Lavoratoreon the behaviour of the TitOrCommunists in Istria. Vidali has classed Tito-Communists with Italian reaction and United States imperialism as the threechief enemies of the &quot; democratic movement.&quot;The Trade Unions. The Sindacati Unici, the union which includes most ofthe workers in the heavy industries, is Cominformist. In September ErnestRadich, former President of the Sindacati Unici, who was forced to resign in1946 owing to his opposition to Yugoslav political interference, was co-opted onto the Executive and by the end of the month had taken over direction. TheCamera del Lavoro, which is pro-Italian and non-Communist, is afraid that theSindacati Unici will now get the full support of the Italian Communist Party,-and of the Communist-dominated General Confederation of Labour (C.G.I.L.).The Sindacati Unici Congress of 4th and 5th December expelled its pro-Titoleaders. The Labour Office of A.M.G. has estimated that in the United States/United Kingdom Zone, which contains the great majority of organised workers,the Sindacati Unici has about 30,000-35,000 members, the Camera del Lavoro-about 60,000.GREECEK.K.E. Strength. The Greek Communist Party (K.K.E. KommounistikonKomma Ellados) was founded in 1920, was suppressed but thrived undergroundduring the Metaxas dictatorship (1936-41), and took a leading part in the resistance movement during the occupation. It has tried to overthrow the GreekGovernment since the liberation, and was outlawed by the Government inDecember 1947. Its youth organisation (E.P.O.N.-Eniaia Panelladike OrganosisNeon) was dissolved by court order in February 1947, when strength was estimatedat 185,000, excluding those fighting in the mountains. It is reported that E.P.O.N.has reappeared (clandestinely) under the title Eamike Panellenike OrganosisNeolaias, but no figures of its membership are available. The strength of K.K.E.as a whole cannot be calculated, although detailed statistics are available of individual cells and satellite organisations; but it is estimated (January 1949)that between 25,000 and 28,000 rebels are fighting against the Greek Army inthe mountains. Of these some 7,000 are regarded by the Communist Party as&quot; reliable.&quot;Communists in Government. There are no Communists in the Greek Govern-ment as there are none in the Chamber of Deputies. At the last General Election(March 1946) the Left-wing parties abstained from voting, but an analysis madeby the Allied Mission which observed the elections gives some indication of the potential Communist vote. The mission, reported that, of 40 per cent, of the electorate who did not vote, 25 per cent, abstained because of &quot; sickness, physicalincapacity, indifference, or similar causes which seemed to have no relation toany political policy,&quot; and only some 15 per cent. (280,000 persons) abstained for&quot;party&quot; reasons. Again, not all of these were Communists. The 280,000abstainers also included the E.L.D. coalition (the Union of Leftist Democrats),a small group of former Liberals, and three or four smaller groups of the Left-Centre.
In the mountainous parts of Greece controlled by the rebels, the Communists-in December 1947 set up a &quot; Provisional Democratic Government of Free Greece &quot;under the premiership of &quot;General Markos &quot; (Markos Vafiades). This Juntawas not recognised by any Government but it was welcomed by. Communists every-where and representatives were sent to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. In the &quot; FreeGovernment^ &quot; territory a form of local government and legislature were setup, and local &quot; elections &quot; held.Communist Penetration. It is difficult to assess the degree of Communistpenetration of the services, the police, the civil service, the trade unions or thenon-Communist political parties, but estimates can be attempted as follows: (a) The A rmed Forces and police the Communist Organisation of the Army and Security Corps(K.O.S.SA. Kommounistike Organosis Stratou Somaton Asfaleias) was formed in February 1945. Its aims are: to incite disobedience and riots inthe armed forces; to collect intelligence on such subjects as order of battle of Government forces, military intentions, defence works, officers&apos; personalrecords and intelligence obtained by Greek Government; to encouragedesertion to the Rebel Army. It is virtually impossible to obtain reliablefigures of K.O.S.S.A.&apos;s strength but, at the end of November 1948, Communistsources estimated it at 3,285 (1^ per cent, of the total strength of the Greekarmed forces).(6) Civil service in March 1947 K.K.E. records showed 11,250 Communists in Governmentdepartments and 315 in nationalist organisations of civil servants. At thattime it was estimated that 7 per cent, of K.K.E. were civil servants; certainlyone of the 16 K.K.E. sections in Athens was formed entirely of civil servants.Since December 1947, however, it has been impossible for any avowedCommunist to hold any civil service post and most of them have beendismissed; but it is impossible to guess how many crypto-Communists remain.(c) Trade UnionsThe Workers&apos; Anti-Fascist League (E.R.G.A.S. Ergatikos Anti-fasistikos Syndesmos) is the workers&apos; association through which the communists hope to penetrate the Greek trade unions. In March 1946:E.R.G.A.S. managed to secure five seats on the Executive of the GreekConfederation of Labour as against four for its combined opponents, but inJuly their election was declared invalid and a provisional executive wasappointed to act until fresh elections could be held at a congress in March1948. From this Congress a predominantly right-wing executive emerged,and it seems that E.R.G.A.S.&apos;s influence in the trade unions is decreasing;but their numbers are unknown.(d) Non-Communist Political PartiesEstimates of Communist penetration of the other political parties areattempted from time to time, but no reliable figures are available.Known Contacts with Communists Abroad. Zachariades (the leader ofK.K.E.) and Porfyrogenis make regular visits to Moscow and the Central Euro-pean countries. Moreover, practically every capital in Europe, including London,and New York have their Committees for Aid to Democratic Greece, which sendfinancial and material aid to the Greek Communists. In addition, United Nationsobservers have witnessed the logistical support given by Albania, Bulgaria and.Yugoslavia to the rebels.Potential Fifth Column. It is unsafe to assume that the numbers quoted above represent a potential fifth column. Some believe that nine-tenths of theGreek rebels and their supporters are at heart Greeks first and Communists second,who would not hesitate to join the Greek Army against any foreign invader.Others, however, point out that during 1948 the hard core (say, 7,000) of the-Rebel Army has established a much greater esprit de corps than the rebelshave had before and believe that these 7,000 would follow their present leaders,,whatever they did, if there were a Slav invasion.
DENMARKI. Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti.2. About 28,000.3. Less than 1 per cent. (0-7 per cent.).4. Party membership constituted 1 -1 per cent, of the 1947 electorate.5. It holds 9 seats of a total of 148, representing 6 -1 per cent.6. There are no Communists in the National Government.7. It recorded 141,094 votes in the elections to the Folketing in 1947. Thefigure represented 6-8 per cent, of the poll.8. Its influence is very small in the actual Services, but somewhat greater in the Home Guard. Lately the Communists have lost ground also in the home guard, and the vast majority of the Force is fully reliable.9.   It is slight.10. Its influence is very small. There is no known organised penetration ofGovernment Departments or Civil Service organisations.II. Within the trade union movement as a whole Communist influence isnot great. They are, however, fairly strong in certain unions in. Copenhagenand have shown themselves capable of fomenting and sustaining unofficial strikes in opposition to the trade union leadership.12. No regular open contact is maintained. Communist leaders pay- occasional visits to the Soviet Union and satellite countries.13. Danish Communist leaders frequently meet their Swedish and norwegian opposite numbers. Contact with Sweden appears to be more frequentthan with Norway (vide also under Finland).14. As a fifth-column, its potentialities are probably not very great, but many Communists gained experience of underground work during the occupation.A considerable quantity of arms is still at large in the country, and of these asubstantial proportion may well be in Communist hands.NORWAYI. Norges Kommunistiske parti.2.   17,600 (in February, 1949).3. About 0-6 per cent.4. About 0-8 per cent.5. It holds 11 seats out of 150, representing 7-3 per cent.6. There are no Communists in the National Government.7. (a) It recorded 167,704 votes in the Storting elections of 1945. TheCommunist vote represented 11 per cent, of the total poll.(6) It recorded 143,205 votes in the local elections held in November 1947.This represented 10-4 per cent, of all votes, as the poll was smaller than in theStorting elections.8.   Its influence in the armed forces is negligible.9.   Its influence in the police is very small.10. Its influence in the Civil Service is very small. There is no knownorganised penetration of Government Departments or Civil Service Organisations.II. Its influence in the trade union movement is small. Communists controlonly about one-seventh of the Representative Council of Trade Union confederation-tion and no district Trades Council. Nevertheless, the Party has shown itselfable to foment local unofficial strikes in important industries. The Communistsmust be expected to make a special effort among the seamen.
12. There is no regular open contact, with the Soviet Union. Communist,leaders pay occasional visits to that country and satellite States.13. Periodical meetings with Swedish and Danish Communists are held..Finnish Communists frequently also participate (vide also under Finland).14. Norwegian Communists gained considerable experience of undergroundwork during the occupation, but it is doubtful whether even any great number-of Party members would be prepared to fight against their own countrymen.Communist fifth-column activity is likely to be strongest in northern Norway,,but the Party&apos;s potentialities are probably lower than those of the Danish and swedish sister parties.SWEDENI. Sveriges Kommunistika parti.2.   About 50,000.3.   Less than 1 per cent, (about 0-9 per cent.).4.   About 1-2 per cent.5. In the indirectly elected First Chamber of 150 members the Communists,hold 3 seats, representing 2 per cent. In the directly elected Second Chamber the-Communists hold 8 seats out of a total of 230. This represents less than 3-5 per-cent.  The Communist percentage of the Riksdag as a whole is below 2 - 9.6.   There are no Communists in the National Government.7. It recorded 244,812 votes representing 6 - 31 per cent, of the total poll3,879,098 in the General Election held on 19th September, 1948. Despite an.increase of 792,794 votes over the total poll of 1944, the Communist Party received73,654 fewer votes than in that year.8.   Its influence in the armed forces is negligible.  The military authorities.,moreover, keep a close watch on known Communists during their conscript -service.9. Its influence in the police is very small. In Stockholm a Communist,.Set Persson, presides over the Police Committee of the City Council, but that body does not exercise control over police activities.10.   In the Civil Service the Party&apos;s influence is also very small.  A certain,number of Communists must be assumed to have entered the Civil Service, butthere are no indications of organised penetration in any Government department or in Civil Service organisations.II. The Communists are strong in certain trade unions, notably in the branches of the Metal Workers&apos; Union, and their influence is disproportionatelylarge to their numbers. Nevertheless they only constitute a small, though well organised minority. During recent months their importance has furtherdecreased.12.   There is no overt regular contact with the Soviet Union.   Communistleaders pay occasional visits to that country and to Soviet satellite countries.13. Frequent meetings take place between Scandinavian Communist leaders.Representatives of the Finnish Communist Party are also often present. Theexistence of a Scandinavian Communist Bureau has been rumoured. It is saidthat it formerly had its location in Oslo but that it was moved to Gothenburgduring the spring of 1948. The police in that city have been unable to confirmthese reports (vide also under Finland).14. Its potentialities as a fifth-column should not be over-rated. The vast majority of party members would probably shrink from taking an active partagainst their own country in case of war. The Communist leaders would almost certainly be rounded up by the police very rapidly, but a certain amount of sabotage-might be expected, in all probability directed chiefly against communications,,power installations and shipyards.
FINLANDI. Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue (S.K.P.).2.   About 35,000.3.   Less than 1 per cent (about 0-9 per cent.).4.   About 1-3 per cent.5. The Communist Party holds 33 seats out of a total of 200, representing-16-5 per cent. To this, however, must be added 5 seats held by fellow travellerswho have joined with the Communists in the Finnish People&apos;s Democratic Union(S.K.D.L.). The S.K.D.L. invariably votes and acts as a single body. Its38 members, accordingly, constitute 19 per cent, of Parliament, and it is this figure which should be regarded as effective Communist strength.6.   There are no Communists in the National Government.7. It polled about 360,000 votes put of a total poll of 1,772,505 in the GeneralElection held in July 1948. This represents 20-3 per cent. The figures are inrespect of the votes recorded on the joint lists of the S.K.D.L.8. Its influence is not very great. Most officers have fought against theSoviet Union and regard Communism with implacable hostility.9.   In December  1948 the  Communist-penetrated Secret State Police-; (V.A.L.P.O.) was disbanded by the Government.   Its officers were either dismissedor placed in employment where they are comparatively harmless.   The DistrictForces are not penetrated and the Police, as a whole, is completely loyal to thePresident and the Government.10. Some penetration, albeit on a minor scale, has been effected in the ministries of Supply and Education. Communists hold important posts on theSchool Board and in the administration of the State Broadcasting Corporation.The Government is aware of this latter danger and has already taken steps to curbtheir activities.II. This is fairly considerable. Roughly, two-fifths of the Council of theCentral Federation of Trade Unions (S.A.K.) is Communist-controlled. the communists dominate ten out of thirty-eight affiliated unions, including theimportant unions of transport workers, timber workers and forestry and floatingworkers. They have a considerable nuisance value in the movement, but, despiteseveral attempts, have shown themselves unable to cause a general strike.12. Mme. Hertta Kuusinen-Leino, the Communist leader, as a dutifuldaughter, often visits her father, Otto Kuusinen, of Terijoki notoriety, whooccupies an important position in the Kremlin hierarchy. She may well be themain link between the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties in Finland andthe Scandinavian countries. The Finnish Minister in Moscow is a near Communist.13. Mme. Hertta Kuusinen-Leino frequently visits Stockholm and Oslo(vide 12 above).14. In view of Finland&apos;s exposed position the fifth-column danger must berated highly. Owing to the strong resistance of the remainder of the populationit is, nevertheless, unlikely that the Finnish Communists would be able to carryout a coup on the Czech model without full and open Soviet intervention.ICELANDThe &quot; Socialistaflokkur &quot; (commonly called the Communist Party).No accurate assessment is available, but it is probably not less than 4,000.Based on the above figure, about 3 per cent.Based on the above figure, over 5 per cent.It holds 10 seats of a total of 52, representing over 19 per cent.There are no Communists in the National Government.36805 d
7. In the general election in 1946 the Communists received 13,000 votes or about 20 per cent, of the total poll.8.   Iceland has no armed forces.9. Exact details of penetration of the police are not known, but the influenceis probably moderate.10.   In all probability its influence in the Civil Service is again only moderate.11. In the trade unions, however, its influence is very considerable. Up till the autumn of 1948 the Communists held an absolute majority in the CentralFederation of Trade Unions. They have now lost that majority but still constitute the largest single party. They also control numerous trade union branches at various centres, the most important of these being the Reykjavik Labourers&apos; Union.12., Regular contact with the Soviet Union is not openly maintained, but,nevertheless, liaison certainly exists. Certain Icelandic Communists are employedin the Soviet Legation, and the Legation has taken an active part in circumventingcurrency and import restrictions in order to supply the Communists with literature.13. Icelandic fraternal delegates have attended Communist conferences in scandinavia, but contact appears to be less frequent than between the parties of theother Scandinavian countries.14. Its fifth-column potentialities are probably fairly great. Strikes and&quot;underground propaganda could probably be conducted on an extensive scale, andwere the Communists to obtain arms they would constitute a very grave danger inTiew of the absence of any armed forces at the disposal of the Government. .TheCommunist leaders certainly possess the organisational abilities to engineer a coup.ARGENTINAI. The Communist Party was legalised in October 1945 after fifteen yearsof repression.2.   Its membership is not known, but estimated at 53,000.3.   The Communist vote is of the order of \ per cent, of the population.4.   In March 1948 the vote was under 2^ per cent, of the electorate.5^-6. There are no Communist Deputies or Senators in Congress, or ministers.7. In March 1948 the Communist poll was about 84,000 out of 2,313,000votes cast. Of this total 45,100 votes came from the Federal Capital, where theCommunist proportion reached 7-g per cent. In Mendoza the Communists took7,250 out of 98,000 votes and won three places in the provincial legislature.8-10. The army is probably quite clear of communism, and so is the police.There is no evidence of penetration in the civil service.II. Although the greater part of the trade union movement is harnessedto President Per6n&apos;s Secretariat of Labour, there is considerable and increasingCommunist activity. Trades in which this is strongest are the building industry,petroleum, metallurgy, textiles, market-gardening and the frigorificos.12. Argentine Communist intellectuals have visited Europe. The Slavimmigrants in Argentina are organised into a Slav Union, said to number 270,000,which is closely connected with the Soviet Embassy and is believed also to be in contact with the Argentine Communists.13.   Buenos Aires is said to have become the centre for South America.14. While the Argentine Communist Party appears to be in no conditionto defy the Argentine authorities or even the Peronista organisation, it is possiblethat any general disillusionment with Per6nism might swell the Communistranks.   From the British point of view the main danger is to the meat supply.
19 -       14BOLIVIAI. There is no purely Communist Party. A so-called Communist Partyformed in 1946 was a Government-sponsored device for splitting the Opposition.The Left-wing Revolutionary Party (P.I.R.) is a Marxist party whose leaderDr. force is probably a Communist. It was heavily diluted with non-Communists,many of whom appear to have separated themselves from it because of Dr. force&apos;s;attitude to Russia.2.   P.I.R. was estimated in 1946 to have 15,000 members and 10,000 activesympathisers.3.   This is an insignificant proportion of the total population (estimated3f million).4. The population of genuine Communists in P.I.R. is difficult to ascertain;:in January 1947 P.I.R. probably accounted for a third of the votes cast, or a quarter of the electorate.5. In March 1947 P.I.R. had six Senators out of twenty-seven, and thirty-nine Deputies out of 111.  The proportion of Communists is difficult to ascertain.6.   A member of P.I.R. was in the Cabinet for a short while.7. There is no pure Communist vote. The most recent index is the vote of 13,900 out of 72,000 cast in La Paz in December 1947 (for the Peopled Party).8.   The army is probably free of Communists.9-10.   Insufficient information.II. There has been considerable labour unrest in Bolivia, and the P.I.R.have certainly encouraged some of. the strikes. * Their preponderance in themining areas has been rather shaken by the revival of the    Fascist&quot; M.N.R.The miner&apos;s leader Lechin, a free-lance, might embrace communism if it were-to his interest.12-13.   Dr. force visited Europe in 1947, and was seen with Soviet officials.He, is, or was, in contact with Chilean and Peruvian Communists.14.   The principal danger in Bolivia is to the supply of tin.BRAZILI. The Brazilian Communist Party (P. OB.) was declared illegal in 1935,went underground, was legalised in 1945, and became illegal again in May 1947.2. Its leader boasted it rose from 4,000 members in 1945 to 130,000 in 1946;other estimates halve the latter figure.3.   The total population is 46 million.4.   The electorate is about 7 million.5. In 1945 the Communist Party had 16 seats in the Lower House outof 216; and one Senator out of 63; a second seat in the Senate was won in 1947..The mandates were annulled in January 1948; but two Communists continuedto sit as Socialists.6.   It has never held any offices.7. In 1945 it received 500,000 votes, or 7 per cent, of the electorate. Itfailed to improve on these figures in 1947. Its local strength is in the FederalDistrict (where it held about a third of the seats on the Municipal Council),Pernambuco and Sao Paulo.8-10. At one time it had cells in the army and civil service; steps havebeen taken to eradicate them, but it cannot be said whether they have beeneffective.II. Communists influence in the trade unions was formerly great. TheGovernment now controls the unions through the Ministry of Labour.12.   Luis Carlos Prestes (among others) has visited the U.S.S.R.
13. Since May 1947 he is reported to have taken refuge in Uruguay; contact-with other Latin American Communists appears to have been regularly throughUruguay.14. In case of emergency, the Brazilian Communists could possibly be verytroublesome: in 1948 there were several reports of sabotage which may not havebeen without foundation. There have been, reports of a split among BrazilianCommunists since May 1947, and it is difficult to tell how far their organisationlas survived this.CENTRAL AMERICAI. Communism was legal in Costa Rica till 1948,; when the &quot;Popular.Vanguard &quot; chose the losing side in the civil war.   In El Salvador, Hondurasand Nicaragua, it is illegal.   In Guatemala no organised Communist Party isknown to exist, though there are fellow-travellers in the present Left-wing regime,and there is non-indigenous labour agitation.2-4. In Costa Rica the Popular Vanguard contained Socialists andCommunists, but was led by a Communist. The number of Communists isunascertainable.5-6. In Costa Rica the Popular Vanguard had six Deputies out of fifty-sixbefore the civil war.7. In Costa Rica the Vanguard had 8,000 votes out of 100,000 cast in 1946,but candidates were not presented in all parts of the country.8-10. Information insufficient: it may be assumed that the armies are clear,except perhaps in Guatemala.II. The trade unions are susceptible to Communist influence but it isdoubtful if penetration has gone far except in Guatemala and Costa Rica.12.   A Guatemalan fellow-traveller was for some time minister in Moscow.13.   Contact is generally through Mexico.14. The Central American Communists have little significance as a fifth column : they are perhaps most dangerous in Guatemala.CHILE1. The Communist Party was legalised in 1938 when it joined the PopularFront. It was made illegal again in July 1948, though its Deputies and Senatorsretained their seats.2. Its membership is not known : see question 7. Communist sympathisershave been estimated at 200,000. Names struck off the voting registers under the*&apos; Defence of Democracy &apos;&apos; Law number 20,000.3.   The voting strength was 1 per cent, of the population in March 1948.4.   Voting strength was nearly 12 per cent, of the electorate in March 1948.5. The Chilean Communist Party had 16 Deputies out of 147 and 5 Senatorsout of 46.6. It was given three seats in the Cabinet as a result of the electoral supportit gave to President Gonzalez Videla in 1946: the portfolios were lost inMarch 1947. The Chilean is the only Latin American Communist Party to haveattained office.7.   The last record of its voting strength was 80,000 in March 1948.8-10. Before its prohibition the Chilean Communist Party had cells in thearmy, among teachers and in the public service. Efforts to decontaminate thearmy have probably been successful, and anti-Communist measures have been applied throughout the public service.
11.   The main Communist strength lay in the unions, where the Party^exercised an influence disproportionate to its numerical strength.   Strenuousattempts have been made to break the authority of the Communist leaders by&quot; relegating &quot;them away from their own districts, but the Party probably retainsa subterranean hold on the miners and nitrate-workers.12.   A number of intellectuals have visited Europe.13. Contacts exist through Uruguay and Mexico: the Party fosteredCommunism in Peru and Bolivia.14. Under the emergency laws the Government has the situation well inhand, but the Chilean Communist Party has deep roots and can find plenty of opportunity among a &quot; politically conscious &quot; working-class existing in unsatis-factory social conditions. From a strategic point of view the main danger isthe sabotage of copper and nitrate production.COLOMBIAI. There was a legal Communist Party (&quot; The Social Democratic Party &quot;)which split into three parts in 1946-47 : there is also Communist infiltration inthe Left-wing of the Liberal Party.2.   The Social Democratic Party had 12,000 members. :3.   This is an insignificant proportion of the total population.4.   In 1947 the Communist vote fell to 1 per cent, of the electorate.5. The Communists had formerly 5 seats in Congress, which were all lost in 1947: they have only one seat in the departmental assemblies. They hadformerly about 38 seats on municipal bodies.6.   There are no Communist Ministers.7. In 1944 the Communists had 30,000 votes : this dropped to 12,500 in 1947.8-9.   The army and police are probably now clear.10. There has been some penetration in the Ministries of communications and Public Works.II. Communists are preponderant in the Colombian Labour Federation,which is by far the largest body of organised workers in Colombia.12. Insufficient information: contact with Russia appears to be throughMexico.13. There is close contact with Mexico and Havana,14. The Communists could do serious damage in the oilfields.CUBAI. The Communist Party has legal rights.2. The membership of the Cuban Communist Party is said to be about150,000.3.   This corresponds to 3 per cent, of the total population.4. . And to about 7\ per cent, of the electorate.5.   It has 9 Deputies out of 118, and no Senators.6.   It has no members in the Government.7. The Cuban Communist Party had 116,000 votes or just over 5 per cent,of the electorate in 1944 and 130,000 or     per cent, in 1948.8-10.   Insufficient evidence, probably some penetration.II. The Cuban trades unions are organised into the Cuban Labour Con-federation (C.T.C.).   This Was Communist-controlled until 1947, when a split
MEXICO1. The Communist Party is a legal political party; Senor LombardoToledano&apos;s &quot; People&apos;s Party &quot; also contains many known Communists.2.   For this it required to register 30,000 members and 1,000 in each State;this has probably been &quot; arranged.&quot; It had reached 17,000 members in 1938-40,.but dropped to 3,000 in 1943.3.   The membership is an insignificant percentage of the total population.4.   Information insufficient.5-6.   There are no Communist Deputies or Ministers.took place, and there are now two bodies with the same name, the one Communist,,and the other official.   The anti-Communist C.T.C. is itself split.12.   Leaders have visited Poland and the U.S.S.R.13.   There is close contact with Mexico.14. If Cuba lost its present prosperity, the Communists could probably cause serious difficulties.DOMINICAN REPUBLICThere is no legal Communist Party, nor is there likely to be while GeneralTrujillo is in the saddle. There are some Labour agitators, and it is probable-that a number pf Trujillo&apos;s political exiles have embraced Communism. Butthere is virtually none in the country.ECUADORI. There is a small Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1936, but nowfunctions openly.2. Its membership is not known : among the oil workers at Ancoh there are250 members and 200 subscribing sympathisers.3.   Unknown, but very small.4.   Unknown, but small.5.   There appear to be no Communist deputies.6.   There are no Communists in the Government.7.   Information insufficient.8-10.   Attempts to penetrate the army are reported to have failed.II. The Ecuadorean unions are not very strong, but there is Communistactivity, especially on the Coast. The Ahcdn oil strike of July 1948 was due toCommunist workings, but only 20 per cent, of the workers were said to favour a general strike.12,   The Secretary-General, Paredos, has visited Russia.13. Contact appears to be through Bogota, and possibly also Mexico andHavana.14. Attempts have been made to spread Communism in the oilfields, with:partial success.HAITI1. A small Communist Party was formed before the last presidential elec-tions, but was later disbanded.  Its leaders were given &quot; scholarships &quot; abroad.2.   Its active membership did not exceed 200.
7.   There has been no separate national Communist vote.8-10. There appear to be cells in various walks of life, but there is no coh-orete evidence of the extent of penetration.11. The main strength of the Mexican Communists lies in labour circlesand in the &quot; intellectuals.&quot; The Confederation of Mexican Labour was the pointof departure for the Latin-American Confederation of Labour led by Sr. Lom-bardo Toledano; this is pro-Communist, as is Lombardo&apos;s &quot; Workers&apos; University.&quot;12.   Lombardo has several times visited Communist Europe.13. Mexico appears to be a favourite ground for exchanges between otherLatin American countries and Moscow.14. The Communist Party as such is not very dangerous but the People&apos;party might in time come to disrupt the Government bloc.PANAMA1. The Communists are not a legally recognised political party, but are notillegal.  Communists vote with Socialists.2.   Membership is unknown, but estimated at 500.3-4.   Information insufficient.5. One member of the Constituent Assembly of 1945, elected as a Socialist,was a Communist.6.   There are no Communist Ministries.7.   The Communist vote appears to be inseparable from the Socialist.8-10.   Information insufficient.* 11. The Federation of Panamanian Workers is partially led by Communists,as is the United Public Workers&apos; Union.12.   Information insufficient.13.   There is contact with Mexico.14. A very small force could, in view of Panama&apos;s strategic importance, dovery great damage.PARAGUAYI. The Communist Party was legal from August 1946 to January 1947:since fighting on the losing side in the civil war, it has been suppressed.2.   Its membership was estimated at 2,000 to 2,500 at the end of 1946.3.   At 2,500 less than J per cent.4.   No information.5-6.   It has had no representation.7.   No record of any voting.8-10.   Its influence in the public service is probably negligible.II. Part of the trade union movement is probably still fundamentallyCommunist: the Communists controlled the Workers&apos; Council, with perhaps50,000 members, before the civil war of 1947.12-13.   Contacts appear to be through Uruguay.14. At the moment, the Communist Party seems to be endeavouring to reformafter its crushing defeat in the civil war. Its present situation is uncertain, butweak.PERU1. The Communist Party was legal from May 1945 until November 1948,when it was proscribed.
2. Its strength was admitted to be only 9,000 in 1948, or 15,000 withisympathisers.3.   This strength is less than \ per cent, of the population.4.   It represents rather less than 3 per cent, of the electorate.5.   The Communists returned one Deputy in 1939, and five in 1945, out of127; they had no Senators, with the military revolution of October 1948 theirrepresentation was lost.    Eight more Deputies and  three Senators  were-sympathisers.6.   There has been no representation in the Government.7.   In 1945 the total Communist poll was about 30,000.8-9.   There is probably little penetration in the army or police force.10.   Information insufficient.11. Communism in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, derives most ofits strength from the trade unions; but of the large Socialist Party, A.P.RA.,.was entirely anti-Communist.  Both are now illegal.12. No information: the founder of the Peruvian Communist Party,.Mariategui (d. 1930), was trained in Europe.13.   There is contact through Chile and Mexico.14.   The suppression of both A.P.R.A. and the Communist Party may tellrather in favour of the latter.  The military regime may be expected to do their-best to eradicate Communism and it is unlikely that the Communists will beable to attempt overt action.   Influence among the dockers at Callao has been,strong and sabotage there cannot be ruled out,URUGUAYI. The Communist Party is legal.2.   Its membership is unknown; but its voting strength has reached 32,600.3.   By voting strength, it is about \\ per cent, of the total population.4.   Its vote was about 5 per cent, of the total electorate in 1946.5.   It has 5 seats out of 99 in the Chamber and 1 out of 30 in the Senate..6.   It has no representation in the Government.7. In 1942 the Communists polled 14,300 votes; in 1946 32,630, an increase-of 130 per cent.8-10.   Insufficient evidence.II. The Communists dominate the trade unions.12.   The veteran leader, Sr. Gomez, visited Communist Europe in 1948.13. There are contacts with all the neighbouring countries, with Chile andwith Mexico, Uruguay is something of a centre for South American Communists.14. The Communists are well entrenched in labour organisation, and couldsabotage Uruguay&apos;s export trade.VENEZUELA1.   The Communist Party was legalised in October 1945.2.   Its membership is unknown; but its voting strength reached 55,000 in1946 and fell to 45,000 in December 1947.   Some Communists, however, were-registered in the Democratic Action Party.3.   Voting strength in 1946 was 1^ per cent, of the total population..4.   In terms of the electorate, voting strength was A\ per cent.
5. In 1946 the Communists had two seats in Congress out of 160; these dis-appeared with the military revolution of November 1948.6.   There have been no Communist Ministers.7.   The Venezuela Communist Party had 55,000 votes in 1946.8.   The army is probably clear or almost clear.9.-10.   Information insufficient.11. The Venezuelan Communists are strongest among intellectuals and theoilfield workers.12.   The founder of the Venezuelan Party was Russian trained.13.   There is contact with Mexico.14. The Venezuelan oilfields are of great strategic importance, and even anunderground Communist movement could do vital damage.TURKEYGeneral feeling in Turkey is extremely strong against Communism. TheCommunist Party is illegal. The only Communist group suspected to exist is con-fined to a few intellectuals in large towns, who are vigorously and efficiently sup-pressed by the Police.EGYPTI. There is no legal Communist Party, but an illegal body called the &quot; Demo-cratic Movement of National Liberation &quot; (Haraket al Dimokratiya lil Tahrur alWatani) is Communist in word and deed. Another illegal Communist group, &quot; LaLigue Juive contre le Sionisme,&quot; is closely connected with it.2. It is impossible to make any estimate of the total strength of these groups,or to distinguish between individuals who are genuine Marxists and those who are merely, self-seeking agitators of varying shades of political pink. Genuine Com-munists probably number not more than a few hundreds, perhaps a thousand at thevery most.3.-7.   Not applicable.8.-9. The armed forces and, perhaps, the police are Communist-penetratedto some extent. The D.M.N.L. has a police and army section, which was active in mid-1948, but there is no reliable information on the extent of its present member-ship. A body formed in the summer of 1948, &quot;The Union of armed forces inthe army and the police,&quot; will doubtless be used to ventilate the widespread dis-satisfaction with the conditions of service which has been growing in both forces during the past year. Whether it has any Communist connexions is not known.The lowered morale of the army, caused by the Palestine campaign, may also be exploited by the Communists.10. There is no evidence of Communism in the Civil Service. Civil Servantswould be particularly careful to keep any such sympathies secret.II. There is, as yet, little real Communism in the trade unions, but organised labour has, nevertheless, proved a receptive perhaps the most receptive seedbedfor Communist propaganda. Several important strikes, particularly that at theMehalla al Kubra textile factory in September-October 1947, undoubtedly had a degree of Communist inspiration behind them. Mohammed Yusuf al Mudarik,one of the Egyptian representatives to the W.F.T.U. Conference at Prague in 1946,heads a body called the &quot; Democratic Committee for the Liberation of Labour,&quot;believed tp be closely tied to the D.M.N.L. Practically nothing is known of its composition.11a.   The students, particularly those of the Cairo and Alexandria univer-necessities, have also proved a receptive field to Communist seed.   The D.M.N.L. isbelieved to be in touch with Communist-minded students, but it must be emphasised36805 e
that in most cases these sympathisers are merely giving expression to a frothyxenophobia and cannot be described as genuine Uommunists.12. The Soviet Legation in Cairo is probably in closer touch with theD.M.N.L. (and with its leader, Henri Curial) than recent reports show. Certainhigh-level members of the Wafd Party are known to have been in contact with theLegation. In the past the satellite missions (particularly the Yugoslavs) appearto have been mainly responsible for directing Communist activities in Egypt.13. The Soviet Legation in Beirut is believed to be the main centre fromwhich instructions are issued to other Middle East countries. So far, however,there is no evidence of any links between Egypt and Lebanon, or even Palestine and israel potentially much more likely sources of infection. The only confirmedlink is with the Sudan. The D.M.N.L. is known to be in contact with the SudaneseNational Liberation Movement, and is believed to have a section dealing exclusivelywith Sudanese elements particularly visiting students.14. The Egyptian masses are easily rouse&quot;d, and there is much smoulderingdiscontent which could well be exploited, but at present there is no strong party orprominent leader who could gain the support of the mob, the armed forces and thecivil administration. Communism in Egypt is thus unlikely to extend its influencefar beyond its present limits. The Greek community in Cairo certainly containssome Communists, but they have so far kept outside the orbit of the Egyptian move-ment. Since the outbreak of hostilities in Palestine the police have made wide-spread arrests of Communist suspects (particularly Jews) with the result, that theIXM.N.L. has now been stifled almost out of existence. There are reports that itis breaking up into small, separate groups.THE SUDAN1. There is no legal Communist Party in the Sudan, but a body known asthe &quot; Sudanese Movement of National Liberation &quot; has Communist tendencies.. 2. The few members (all Sudanese) are mainly students from the GordonCollege in Khartoum and are unimportant as individuals. There are not likelyto be more than a hundred of them.3-7.   Not applicable.8-11. The armed forces, police, civil service and trade unions all appearto be clear.12. There are no known links between the &quot; Movement&quot; and any Sovietconsular or diplomatic officials. The &quot;Movement&quot; was, however, mentionedapprovingly by Moscow Radio in October 1948.13. The &quot;Sudanese Movement of National Liberation &quot; is undoubtedlylinked&apos;with the Egyptian D.M.N.L! During the past year several students atEgyptian universities have taken part in Communist activities, and a body inEgypt known as the &quot; General Union of Sudanese Students &quot; is Communist-dominated.14. The influence of the Sudanese &quot; Movement &quot; is extremely limited, and likely to remain so in the foreseeable future. As as potential fifth-column, there-fore, it need not yet be given serious consideration.ETHIOPIA1.   There is as yet no known Communist Party or group.2-7.  Not applicable.8-11 There does not appear to be any Communist influence in the armed forces; police, or civil service.  Trade union organisation is virtually non-existent.12 Communist propaganda, some of which reaches Somalia and even theBeleian Congo, is undoubtedly disseminated from the Soviet Legation, but so^tarthere is no evidence that this mission is directing Communist activities anywhere
in Africa. A Soviet hospital in Addis Ababa, opened in 1947, provides a goodcover for underground activities.13. The Somali Youth League, a vociferous Nationalist organisation, was reported in December 1948 to harbour a small Communist cell. There are a few thousand members of the League in Ethiopia.14. So far the Ethiopians have proved unresponsive to Communist propa-ganda, and are likely to remain so. The Greek community (which is comparativelylarge) presents the only fertile field for Communist seed. The Left-wing section is believed to be organised into Communist cells, and in December 1948 some fortysuspects were under observation.PALESTINE1. The Palestine Communist Party is recognised as a political party by thepresent Jewish authorities. Details of Communist Party organisations are asfollows:  &quot;(a) Jewish(I) The Palestine Communist Party (P.K.P.). Early this year itwas agreed that it should be regarded as a Jewish national party on conditions that it ceased to oppose the creation of a Jewishnational State (which it opposed until Russia declaredof it) and unrestricted immigration. It thereupon adopted thenew title of &quot;The Communist Party of Eretz Israel.&quot; the leader is Shmuel Mikunis, and other prominent members areMeir Wilner, Esther Wilenska and Eliahu Goszanskl,(2) The Hebrew Communist Party, led by Meir Slonim, has alwaysfavoured Jewish national Communism, in contrast to the P.K.P.,which, until the Russian change of policy over Palestine, aimed at collaboration with the Arabs and the creation of a unitaryState. Now that P.K.P. has adopted its policy there seems littlereason for the Hebrew Communist Party&apos;s separate existence.It did not put forward a separate list of candidates for -the january 1949 elections.(3) Reports of unknown reliability gave the formation of a &quot; Leagueof the Friends of Liberty &quot; as having taken place in September,apparently under Communist auspices. Nothing further has beenheard of this organisation. One Arazi, described as the head ofa branch in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, was men-tioned as present at the early meeting.. (6) Arab :      . - . &apos;.The Arab League for National Liberation (A.L.N.L.) is the Communistorganisation. Originally part of the Palestine Communist Party,it became a separate party, while retaining contacts with Jewishorganisations. The breach became wider after last November,when the United Nations Assembly voted in favour of partition,but the latest reports show that the A.L.N. has changed its policyand is working closely with, and is dominated by, the P.K.P. Itsleaders are Emil Thuma, Fuad Nasr and Hanna Nagana.2. In April 1947 the P.K.P. was reported to number 3,700 full members and 1,500 voluntary contributors. Its youth movement was estimated to be 650strong. This brings the total number of party members and subscribers at thattime to about 6,000. The Hebrew Communist Party is estimated to- have about,000 members. Fellow-travelling organisations, such as the V-League, the progressive Union of Ex-Servicemen, the Pan-Slav Union, and others, are not included; sympathisers in these bodies must have increased recently owing toconsistent Russian support for the Jewish State.A.L.N.L. membership was reported to be 5,700 in April 1947. Since theUnited Nations partition resolution it has largely disintegrated, and its leaders have, for the most part, fled to the Levant. Reports that it was organising Arabworkers under Jewish control in Nazareth, and was recognised by the Jews asa political party (August 1948) have since been confirmed (but see 1.(6) above).
3. Jews. The figure of 1-5 per cent, given in the earlier edition of thisreport has probably been increased by subsequent immigration from eastern europe. No accurate figure can, at present, be suggested.Arabs: Unknown.4.   3-5 per cent, of the total votes cast.5. It has four seats on the Jewish Constituent Assembly of 120 member selected in January 1949.6. It had no members in the former National Government, and is unlikely to be represented in the Government now being formed.7. In January 1949, in the elections for the Constituent Assembly, the Com-munist Party polled 14,999 votes.8. (a) Haganah. This &quot; Defence &quot; force has now become the Israeli army.The &quot; Palmach,&quot; its &quot; striking force,&apos;5 was reported in March 1948 to be plannedwith an establishment of 20,000, including many Russian-speaking members whohad entered Palestine illegally. Another report suggested that Communists hadinfiltrated into the Haganah about that time. The Palmach is under the influence of the powerful Mapam party which contains a Communist element.(6) The Irgun Zvai Leumi. This terrorist organisation was dissolved, assuch, late in 1948; its place was taken, politically, by the Herut Party. Its unitswere absorbed into the army. As the Herut shows Communist sympathy it is tobe assumed that the members of the party in the army also represent a potentialCommunist influence.(c) The Stern Gang-&quot; the Fighters for the Freedom of Israel,&quot; and now a political party, which put forward candidates on a &quot; Fighters&apos; and Soldiers&apos; &quot;list, is a revolutionary party of the Right rather than Communist, though itwould readily lend itself to communism if such a course appeared profitable.The extent of its influence in the armed forces is unknown.9.   The extent of Communist influence in the police is unknown.10. The extent of Communist influence in the civil service is unknown (butsee 1 (a) 3 above).* 11. Jews.-After the fusion of the Hashomer Hatzair and the LabourUnity Party (both extreme Left parties with a &quot; class struggle &quot; programme) in* January 1948, which, with the Poale Zion, became the Mapam, in February 1948,it was reported that 40 per cent, of the Histadruth (Jewish Trades Union Move-ment) were veering towards the East, but that 20 per cent, only would followan extreme Left-wing party.The Histadruth is a very powerful organisation, which, in the past, had alarge measure of control over the Jewish Agency in Palestine. Until 1946the Communists were excluded from the Histadruth, but in 1947 the P.K.P. gaineda considerable influence in it. In August 1947 it was claimed that the&quot;Communist Fraction&quot; in the movement numbered 7-8,000 (out of, perhaps,150,000). The creation of the Mapam, with its Communist leanings, must beregarded as, potentially, increasing this figure considerably.Arabs. In September 1947 the A.L.N.L; claimed to control 4,000 members,consisting of the &quot; Progressive Trade Unions,&quot; out of a total of 18,000 membersrepresented at the Arab Workers&apos; Congress.12. Contacts with the Soviet Legation in Beirut have been frequent. Thisis especially true of the A.L.N.L., although when representatives of the Legationvisited Palestine they have contacted Jewish Communists also. There havebeen a few contacts with the Soviet Legation in Cairo. Since August 1948 therehas been a Soviet Legation in Tel Aviv, but no reports of its contacts with localparty leaders have been received.In November 1947 it was reported that members of the Slavonic Union, SovietSection (previously known as the Union of Russian Patriots) would have direct contact with the Central Committee. There are probably contacts with the JewishAnti-Fascist Committee headquarters in Moscow.Immigrants (illegal before 15th May, 1948) probably form a direct channel of contact with Soviet Russia, but numerical details are at present impossible toobtain.13. The P.K.P. had close contact with the French Communists, and through them with the Anti-Fascist League in Moscow, which is the responsibility of a soviet Minister.
The Hebrew Communist Party has had links with the satellite countries,especially Poland.. *In Warsaw there is reported to have been set up early in 1947 a &quot; PolishPalestine Friendship Committee.&quot; Palestinians who have visited Warsaw havecollaborated with this Committee.At the beginning of 1947 it was reported that the Jewish V-League was tobe extended, and that there would be a World Union of Jewish V-Leagues withcentres at Tel Aviv, Paris and Moscow.The Pan-Slav Union has contacts with satellite countries.Shmuel Mikunis made a tour of Eastern Europe in July 1948.1 The P.K.P. made contact with Communists in the United States, whenMeir Wilner toured the country in late 1947 and succeeded in collecting substantial sums of money.There have been reports of Roumanian and German Groups in the P.K.P.The former appear to have been members of the Roumanian Communist Party,to have been partisans during the war, and to number about 50.The Polish Consulate-General in Tel Aviv developed during 1947 into a centre of Communist activities.There have also been contacts with Poland by extreme Leftists, e.g., Dr. MosheSneh (Mapam), who is not an avowed Communist; he has visited Poland twicewithin a year.14.   The potentialities of the Arab Communists as a fifth column are small.The Jewish Communists, though a small percentage of the total population and with little representation in official bodies, represent a greater threat than their numbers indicate for reasons many of which are clear from the information given above. The Communists&apos; leanings of the Mapam make it an agency ofconsiderable danger. The conditions favourable to them are, in sum, as follows :The state of war or emergency in which armed violence prospers; the tendency of the Jews to spilt into large numbers of political factions; the sympathy forthe U.S.S.R. increased by the latter&apos;s consistent support for a Jewish State;direct support from the U.S.S.R. and satellite countries in men and probablywar materials; the tradition of violence and authoritarianism among a large partof the Jewish population of Palestine.TRANSJORDANNo Communist organisations exist in Transjordan, and attempts by a fewindividuals to air Communistic theories have been firmly suppressed by theTransjordan authorities. It is probable that the individuals in question were merely seeking notoriety and were not members of any organisation.A law, published in the Official Gazette on 16th May, 1948, makes allactivities in favour of communism illegal.SYRIA1. There is no legal Communist Party. It was suppressed on 2nd Decem-ber, 1947, after four years of overt, but not continuously legalised, existence.The suppression was followed on 18th December by the suppression of allpro-Soviet organisations.2. The actual membership of illegal Communist movements is estimated at,000-2,500 (excluding Armenian Communists-less than 500). Sympathisers are estimated at 15,000-20,000.3. The percentage of the total population is about - 07 per cent,(sympathisers -7 per cent.).4. The percentage of the electorate is about -15 per cent, (sympathisers1 - 5 per cent.)5.   They have no members in the national Parliament.6.   They have no members in the national Government.7.   No Communist stood as such in the July 1947 elections, and no knownCommunist standing under another banner was elected.
8. In the middle of 1946 it was reported that no trace of Communismappeared in the Syrian Army. At the end of 1947 it was reported that penetration of the Army and of the Military Academy at Horns had been attempted, and thatthese attempts had the tacit support of the Minister of Defence. If this is so,there has as yet been no evidence of any successful results of penetration. this may be the deliberate policy of the leaders, who are said to be restricting their efforts to propaganda at present.9. At the end of 1947 an attempt at penetration of the &apos;&apos; Deuxieme Bureau &quot;was reported.10.   So far as is known they have no influence in the Civil Service.11. Trade Union organisation is weak; there is no central body, though there is a Damascus Federation of Trade Unions. Communists have made efforts to penetrate the Unions, but an estimate of their membership of the principalUnions (May 1948) puts it at rather less than 1 per cent, (excluding sympathisersand fellow-travellers). On the other hand, in October 1947 Communists were reported to have gained six out of nine places among the newly elected members to the Committee of the Damascus Tailors&apos; Syndicate. It is clearly the policyof the Communists to penetrate the Unions, but so far they have not had muchsuccess.12. Relations with the Soviet Legation in Beirut were maintained even after the suppression of the Party in Syria. This Legation is believed to be a source of funds for the Party.The Polish Consul in Damascus has been reported to have engaged in&quot;undesirable activities.&quot;The Orthodox Church has certain links with the Russian OrthodoxPatriarchate.13. From 1943 to 1945 the Lebanese and Syrian Communist Parties acted as one body. From June 1945, when the first National Congress was held, theParties of the two countries.became separate. Since suppression in both countriesactivities have been more closeiy co-ordinated again.There has been considerable liaison with other Middle East countries Iraq,&quot;Persia, Egypt, Palestine and Cyprus. Contacts have also been made with the balkans and France. In October 1947 an emissary was reported to be goingto Paris to contact the Comintern; later the Yugoslav Charge d&apos;Affaires inBeirut was reported to be used as an emissary to the Cominform on his visit toBelgrade.. &quot;14. Although the leader of the Syrian Communists, Khalid Biqdash, issaid to be Cominform Agent for the Middle East, and is clearly a leading bom-munist figure in the Middle East, Syrian Communism is not far advanced. its organisation is poor and it lacks trained cadres. It lost ground during theelections of July 1946, when it did not succeed in gaining a single seat, and theRussian attitude to Palestine since the autumn of 1947 has been disastrous toits cause. It has recently caused disagreement between Khalid Biqdash, whofollows the Russian line favouring partition, and Rashid Issa (Secretary of theDamascus Branch), who agrees with the Arab policy which rejects this solution.In April 1948 Biqdash was reported to have given orders that all Party activitiesmust cease until further notice. Many desertions to the Muslim Brotherhood(which has denounced Communism) have been reported. In November 1948 ascheme of reorganisation was reported.As a political force in present political conditions its influence is negligible.The Party does, however, comprise a number of presumably loyal members who,in a &quot; revolutionary situation,&quot; might cause considerable trouble, as they aredoubtless well-versed in the Communist revolutionary technique. Other countries whose pre-war percentage of Communists was under 1 per cent, of the population are now under a Communist dictatorship. The danger from fifth-columnactivities is not altogether a function of the number of known Communists.THE LEBANON1. There is no legal Communist Party. It was suppressed on 8th January,1948, after four years of overt, though not legalised, existence. Affiliatedorganisations the Union of Syndicates and the Society for Cultural Relationswith the U.S.S.R. were also suppressed at about the same time.
2. An estimate of February 1948 puts the membership at 12,000, withsympathisers at 50,000.3. The percentage of the total population is 1 per cent, (sympathisers 4 percent.).4. The percentage of the electorate is 2 per cent, (sympathisers 8 per cent.).5. They, have no members in the national Parliament.6. They have no members in the national Government.7. In the May 1947 national elections 17,000 votes were polled for Communistcandidates, but the issues before the electorate were much confused and this figure should not be considered as evidence of support.8. There have been reports of penetration of the armed forces for intelligencepurposes.9, There have been reports of penetration of the Police for intelligencepurposes.10. There have been reports of penetration of the Civil Service, as in and 9 above. There is little doubt that Communist leaders receive advance information of the Governmenfs intentions towards the Party.11. Penetration of Trade Unions has been considerable. Mustafa Aris,Member of the Central Committee of the Lebanese Communist Party and middle east Representative on the World Federation of Trade Unions, organised theCommunist-controlled &quot; Union of Syndicates &quot; with the object of gaining controlof the whole of the,Lebanese Trade Union movement. In this he did not succeed,and two anti-Communist groups have emerged- &quot;The League of Workers&apos;Syndicates&quot; and the &quot; Labour Front.&quot; Early in 1947 the League consisted ofsome ten Unions, as opposed to six in the Union of Syndicates, and claimed to beat least as strong as the latter. In September 1947 the Government announcedthat no Trade Union might operate without an official licence a measure designedto control Communist penetration. As a result of opposition to this enactment,particularly from Mustafa Aris, who threatened widespread strikes, the Govern-ment allowed those Unions already in existence to continue. This concession hadthe effect of counteracting the Government intention and aiding the CommunistUnions, as it was made at a time when they were still fairly strong, but on thedecline. The suppression of the Union of Syndicates in January 1948 has reducedits influence to a level far below what it was before, though a newspaper in April1948 reported that ten Unions had petitioned the President for its recognition:the influence of the non-Communist Unions has consequently increased. Ariswas arrested on 19th November, 1948, for organising a demonstration outside thebuilding in Beirut in which the U.N.E.S.C.O. Conference was being held.12. The Soviet Legation at Beirut has been the centre of Russian contacts with Communist movements in the Levant countries. The Tass representative inthe Lebanon has also been actively engaged in Communist contacts and activities.There have been two visits this year from a Cominform representative, and it isreported that the Cominform effort in the Levant States is-to be stepped up.Mustafa Aris visited the International Trades Union Conference in. Moscow inthe autumn of 1946.13. There have been frequent contacts with other countries in the middle east, particularly with Syria, from whose Communist Party the LebaneseCommunist Party was separated only in 1945. Since the suppression of the communists of the two countries they have been co-ordinating their activitiesclosely.In April 1948 there was a conference held in the Lebanon at whichCommunists from Syria, Iraq and Palestine were present.In May 1948 negotiations were taking place with the Yugoslav Legation inBeirut to send a delegation to Yugoslavia. It is not known whether the visit tookplace.The Cominform are reported to be sending three delegates to visit middle eastern countries, and to have asked the Soviet Legation to assist them. Thereis no news yet of their arrival.14. During the last year there has been a decline in Communist influence,owing partly to Russian policy in Palestine, and partly to internal dissensions.
The decline was accelerated by the suppression of the Party and affiliatedorganisations, and there is now a lull in Coinmunist activities. A clandestinenewspaper continues to be printed, and has a circulation of about 1,500. Thereis not a high level of organisation nor highly-trained cadres in the Party, thoughmembership is much larger than in Syria.It has been reported that a few terrorist groups are being trained in sabotage,the object of their activities, when begun, being to intimidate politicians and othersinto desisting from anti-Communist activities. The Party&apos;s potentialities as a fifth column are, like those of all Communist Parties, considerable, though thenumbers who would take part in such activities are unpredictable and would depend on the circumstances of the time.IRAQI. There is no legal Communist Party. In September 1948, there were twoactive illegal groups, the Iraqi Communist Party (the Qa&apos;ida group), which isknown to have been functioning since January 1947 or earlier, and a splintergroup, &apos;&apos; Al Haqiqa &apos;&apos; (the Truth), whose members are opposed to the Soviet atti-tude towards Palestine in recognising Israel. In October 1948, the police were able to arrest the leaders of the Iraqi Communist Party and deal a smashing blow to its underground apparatus. In November the Qa&apos;ida press was seized, andby the end of the month the group had virtually ceased to function. Interest has since been concentrated on the Haqiqa. The latest information indicates thatAziz Sherif, the leader of the illegal Hizb ash Sha&apos;ab Party, is actively working on behalf of this group, but there is no definite information as to its strength and influence. Its continued co-operation with the Hizb ash ShaVb, however, con-siderably increases its potential danger.2. Figures of membership are uncertain. Present active membership iscertainly not more, probably much less, than 2,000, but the number of fellow-travellers in other parties is believed to be considerably more.3. This represents - 05 per cent, of the total population (based on 1943 censusfigures, giving total population as 4 million).4.   This represents - 2 per cent, of the electorate (very approximately).5.   They have no members in the National Parliament.6.   They have no members in the National Government.7. It is known that all Communists were encouraged to vote for candidatesof the legal Left-wing National Democratic Party at the elections of 1947 and1948, as were the fellow-travellers of the other illegal Left-wing parties.8. Communist influence in the Armed Forces is not great; a few non-commissioned officers and men have so far been influenced. The widespreaddiscontent resulting from the Palestine campaign is, however, likely to make theArmy riper for future exploitation.9. Communist influence in the police is negligible, though one report statesthat one Commandant of Police in Bagdad is sympathetic. In the north of Iraqthere is slightly more influence than in the rest of the country.10. Reports indicate the existence of cells within the civil administration(including the Railways and Basra Port), and especially in the Education Depart-ment. Some influential local Government officials in one or two northern districtsare Communists. The Posts and Telegraphs Department has also been penetratedto some extent mostly by members of the National Liberation Party, an illegalbody connected with the Qa&apos;ida group.II. Trades unions in general are not encouraged by the Government andthose which exist are small and loosely organised. Where they exist, however,Communist penetration has been considerable. During periods of civil unrest in1948 Communist strikers and demonstrators from the Shoemakers&apos;, Weavers&apos;,Tailors&apos;, Press Compositors&apos; and Electricians&apos; Unions have been recognised.Communist success has also been achieved in instigating strikes and unrestamongst Railway workers, the Iraq Petroleum Company, Holloway Brothers andother similar concerns, whilst some penetration has also been achieved of theRafidain Oil Company and the Basra Petroleum Company.
11a. Students have always been fertile material for Communism. During1948 increased support for Left-wing parties occurred and not a few studentswere active members of one or other branch of the Communists. They were in the forefront of all riots and demonstrations of January, February and March, 1948,over the political and economic situation, and many were arrested. The significantpart they played in the anti-&quot; Portsmouth Treaty &quot; riots led to the formation ofa Students&apos; Union in the early part of 1948, which later developed into a purelyCommunist organisation.   This union has since been inactive.11b. Iraqi Communists have always made some,attempt to disseminate theirpropaganda amongst the minorities. Some measure of success has been achievedamongst Kurds by the National Liberation Party working through the KurdishDemocratic Party, although this is offset by the Kurdish desire to obtain inde-pendence rather than to absorb Communist doctrine. Amongst Armenians also some work has been done, but this has been directed almost exclusively to there patriation scheme for Soviet Armenia, and there is no evidence of an ArmenianCommunist Party in Iraq. Some attempts to approach the Assyrian and Turco-man communities have also been made in the past, but without apparent success,and there has been no recent activity. Certain classes of Jews have played their part in the Communist organisation, but there has been no apparent approach tothe community as a separate entity.12. The Soviet Legation in Bagdad has always taken an interest in thevarious Iraqi Communist and other Left-wing groups. Moral support was givento the Left-wing during the January 1948 riots and the demonstrations overeconomic and political matters which followed, and to the strikers generally. by commercial enterprise in the import and sale of Russian goods considerable sums of money have been earned by the Legation and are believed to have been spentlocally on propaganda and possibly on financial aid to various Left-wing groups.13. Contact between Iraqi Communists and the Communist Parties of Syriaand the Lebanon was known to exist in 1947 and still continues. Similarly,contact existed, and appears still to exist, with Persia by means of the MiddleEuphrates pilgrim routes to Ahwaz and so to Tehran. Some traffic in propagandamaterial and intelligence is known to pass by this route, but any evidence of- control exercised through Persia is lacking. The latest indications are, however,that the links between the Persian Tudeh and the &quot; Haqiqa &quot; may be growingstronger. Contact with Syria and the Lebanon is more pronounced, and therehas been growing evidence of control and direction from these countries. InOctober 1948 a joint pamphlet Was issued by the Iraqi, Syrian and LebaneseCommunist Parties and the Palestinian Arab League of National Liberationupholding Soviet policy in Palestine. It was printed by the Qa&apos;ida press. Fromtime to time there have been reports of Barzan tribesmen sent from Russiapenetrating northern Iraq, and some contact with Israel on a minor scale isbelieved to have taken place.14. There is little likelihood in the immediately foreseeable future of IraqiCommunists unaided forming a serious fifth-column. They have made progress,but are still lacking in popular and powerful leadership, political influence and party cohesion. Furthermore, there is a powerful nationalist element in Iraqwhich, whilst strongly opposed to British and American influence, is just asantagonistic to Russian interference of any kind. On the other hand, govern-mental and commercial corruption, scarcity of food and a slackening of trade have worsened the workers&apos; standard of living; the minority questions are nofurther towards being solved; and there are still in the towns unemployed whoWill not do agricultural work. Such conditions have been and will in the future be fully exploited by Communists for their own purpose.PERSIA1. No legal Communist Party exists. The Tudeh Party is, however,Communist in most respects, although it supports the Persian Constitution.Government opposition has driven it underground, although it is not strictlyan illegal Party.** The Party was declared illegal on the 5th February, 1949, as the result of an attempt on the shah&apos;s life carried out by one of its members.
2. Reliable membership figures are non-existent. . The number of activemembers (as distinct from potential supporters) is almost certainly not more than20,000-40,000. The initiation of more effective police control in the autumn of1948 undoubtedly caused a considerable shrinkage in the Party&apos;s ranks.3.   This represents, very roughly, - 05 per cent, or less of the total population.4.   This represents, very roughly, -2 per cent, of the electorate.5. There are no members in the National Parliament (Majlis). The Partydecided to boycott the 1947 elections, but eight Tudeh Deputies (out of 136) were elected to the Fourteenth Majlis, which held office from 1944 to 1946.6. Similarly, there are now no members in the Government. Three TudehMinisters held office from August to October 1946 under Qawam as-Sultaneh.7.   See (5) above.(8) There is little evidence of Tudeh influence in the Armed Forces, although in August 1945 the Party was responsible for instigating a serious mutiny inthe Meshed garrison.9. The Police Training School in Tehran was reported (May 1948) to bea Tudeh propaganda centre. Otherwise there is no evidence of Tudeh support in the Police Force.10 Tudeh influence in the Civil Service is negligible (probably non-existent).11. The Party makes its strongest appeal through the trade unions whichit controls. In April 1948 it was estimated that about one-third of the industrial population of Tehran and Isfahan (the two largest towns) were members of oractive sympathisers with the Tudeh unions (of which the Railway Workers&apos; union is probably the most powerful). In the autumn of 1948 the supporters of the party were almost entirely confined to the industrial section of the population, and this state of affairs is likely to persist. The Tudeh instigated the serious strike inthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company&apos;s Abadan refinery in July 1946. Thereafter,the Party&apos;s hold on the A.I.O.C. employees weakened, although the most recent information indicates a marked revival. It is reliably reported that there arenow about 135 active cells (mostly about five to ten strong) in the A.I.O.C. area.11a. The Tudeh Party has a Youth Organisation of the para-military kind which may be potentially dangerous, but has so far not come into violent conflict with the authorities. In September 1948 the Tudeh Youth boasted that under its guidance 4,000 young people were studying Communism in Persia.12. Direct contact has been maintained with the Soviet Embassy in Tehran,which has undoubtedly financed and guided the Party and probably continues todo so.13. There appears to be some liaison between the Tudeh and the IraqiCommunists groups (see under Iraq).14. The power of the Tudeh is latent rather than overt. Under able leader-ship it will continue to make an appeal tc the ill-fed, ill-clad masses, unlessGovernment social services are improved. The chief danger-spot at present is undoubtedly the province of Khuzistan, which contains the A.I.O.C. fields andrefinery, but there are no signs of a major rising. It must be remembered thatthe country as a whole is strongly opposed to the idea of increased Soviet influence.The Party&apos;s connection with the Soviet Union and the Government^ hostilitytowards it are, therefore, the chief factors which prevent its further expansion;BURMA1.   There are three indigenous Communist Parties, viz.: (a) The Burma Communist Party (&quot; White &quot; Communists), led by ThakinThan Tun. Though the Party is not actually illegal, the majority ofits members have been outlawed by the Government and are now ina state of rebellion. i
(&amp;) The Communist Party (Burma) (&quot; Red Flag&quot; Communists), led byThakin Soe (now under arrest), which broke away from the originalParty in February 1946 and was declared illegal by the Governmentof Burma in January 1947; the grounds of difference between theParties are largely personal, though Thakin Soe was always more extreme than Than Tun.(c) The Union of Burma Communist Party (or Union CP.), formed&apos;by theSocialist ex-Minister of Commerce, U Ko Ko Gyi, after he wasdismissed from office on a charge of corruption in July 1948.2. (a) The Burma Communist Party membership is probably about 4,000,spread throughout the country and carefully organised into district, townshipand village committees; but the membership of affiliated organisations is considerably more, viz.: All-Burma Peasants&apos; Union claims a membership of 300,000; thoughprobably this is double the true figure, the Union has enabled BurmaCommunist Party influence to dominate the country from Pegu to Mandalayand also considerable areas of the Irrawaddy Delta.Democratic People&apos;s Youth League, which is the former Red Guardunder a new name (the new designation being a means of circumventingGovernment orders regarding military organisations), has a strength of about20,000.All-Burma Women&apos;s Congress is closely connected with the BurmaCommunist Party, but the extent of its influence is not known.In addition, some influential organisations, though not actually under Partycontrol, are known to contain Communist sympathisers among their &quot;leaders,viz. :-r-Rangoon University Students&apos; Union, many of whose members aresympathetic to Communism.All-Burma Students&apos; Union, which is affiliated to the Communist-controlled International Union of Students.All-Burma Indian Youth League, affiliated to the World Federation of democratic Youth and which includes among its officials a number of disciplesof Than Tun&apos;s associate, Ghosal.The &quot; White Band &quot; section of the People&apos;s Volunteer Organisation is strongly sympathetic to the Burma Communist Party and is in a state of rebellionagainst the Government owing to the latter&apos;s refusal to come to terms with the communists.(b) The Communist Party (Burma) was estimated in August 1948 to havea membership of 2,000; it is thought, however, that this figure includes a fairproportion of dacoits. The organisation of this Party has been seriously damaged by the arrest of the majority of its leaders, but scattered bands of &quot; Red Flags &quot;continue to operate in Arakan, the Irrawaddy Delta and in the districts along the Irrawaddy River in central Burma. It would appear that former estimates of this Party&apos;s decline in activity were premature.(c) The Union of Burma Communist Party is a small concern of which thereis no information of value.3. The strict party membership of the Burma Communist Party is about -25 per cent, of total population.4. The final figures for the last elections (to the Constituent Assembly inApril 1947) have not been made public, but it is estimated that less than 10 percent, of votes cast were given to the Communists.5. Seven Communists were elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1947,i.e., 3 - 3 per cent, of total members. The number of fellow-travellers is not known.6. There are no Communists in the Government but undoubtedly some ofthe Ministers are sympathetic to Communist ideas, particularly to those in thewritings of Mao Tse-tung.7.   No Communists have stood for by-elections since the general election
8. (a) The new Burma Army contains a large proportion of personnel taken over from the late Aung San&apos;s private army, and there is a strong Leftist tendency in this element. Of the five infantry battalions composed mainly of this type,approximately one and a half battalions deserted in August 1948 at the instigationof senior officers known to be Communist sympathisers; these formations were laterdefeated by loyal troops and their members have scattered. There is thought tobe some Communist sympathy among the remaining battalions recruited from thesame source. The 2 Chin, 3 Karen and 3 Kachin battalions are dependable, and2 of the Burman battalions are also said to be trustworthy.(6) The air force appears to be non-Communist, but it thought that thetheft of a naval launch from Rangoon harbour by the Communists in August indi-cates the presence of Communist sympathisers in the navy.9. Senior officers of the police are known to be anti-Communist. Small-scale desertions have occurred among the lower ranks, but it appears that Com-munist influence is not wide-spread.10. Communism makes little appeal to the higher grades of the civil service,which, in general, are opposed to the disorders which the Communists havefomented, but there is sympathy with the Communists among the ill-paid clericalgrades.  Numerical estimates are not available.11. The trade union movement is in its infancy. The Communist-con-trolled All-Burma T.U.C. comprises only about 2,000 workers, divided among tenunions, all in the Rangoon area.  Most of its leading agitators are under arrest.12. No direct contacts with Soviet Russia are known; indirect contact maybe maintained through the Indian Communist Party.13. (a) Communication by letter and exchange of literature has gone on with the Communist Parties in Malaya, Geneva, Australia, Poland, Belgrade,Hungary, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Paris and Cape Town, but at present theauthorities are intercepting postal communications.(&amp;) H. N. Ghosal (alias Yebaw Ba Tin), an Indian educated in Burma,returned to Burma after the war as the link between the Indian Communist party and the Burma Communist Party. It is probable that the Burma CommunistParty*has received much advice and instruction from the CP.I. by this means.(c) Leading Burma Communists attended the C.P.I. Conference in Calcuttain February 1948, and in the course of the conference two of them, believed tobe Than Tun and Ba Thein Tin, both of the Burma Communist Party Politburo,had a secret conference with Australian, Czech and French Communist delegates.(d) During 1948 two C.P.I. leaders are reported to have visited Burma viaAssam; it is stated by Indian authorities that the C.P.I. hopes to receive armsand munition from the Burma Communists, and expects the Burma revolt to spread to Assam.(e) Indian reports state that regular communication is maintained betweenthe Indian and Burma Communists via Manipur and via Chittagong.(/) There has been correspondence between the Communist Party (Burma)and the &quot;Viet Nam news service in Bangkok.(g) Miss Brickman, the English Communist; Dusan Puhalo, from Yugo-slavia; and Sen Shiu Hwa, from China, visited Burma after the CP.I. Conferencein Calcutta early in 1948 and attended the All-Burma Peasants&apos; Union Congressat Pyinmana in March.(h) In 1945 Communists in the British reoccupation forces made contact withBurma Communists and gave them much assistance and advice in organisation,&amp;c.; communism in Burma owes much of its vitality to this regrettable episode.The connexion is said to have been maintained. Members of the Burma Com-munist Party attended the British Empire Communist Conference in March 1947.(z) The Burma Communist Party leader, Than Tun, recently advocatedco-operation with the Chinese Communists; this could be effected through Com-munists among the Chinese community in Burma or by trans-frontier communi-cation with Communists in Yunnan. Than Tun and Ghosal are reported to have attended a Communist conference at Kengtung, bordering Yunnan, French Indo-China and Siam, in October 1948.14. Communists in Burma could do great damage by way of sabotageof communications always easy in a relatively undeveloped country and byinfiltration into the armed forces. At the moment, however,, they are in a stateof active rebellion.
CHINAaOwing to the uncertain and rapidly changing conditions in China no effectiverevision of this section of the Survey is feasible at the moment.FRENCH INDO-CHINA1. (a) The Communist Party of Indo-China was never recognised as legalby the French authorities.In November 1945 it was nominally absorbed in the Viet Minh League, butthe Viet Minh itself is dominated by a small group of Communists and may beregarded as a Communist organisation.(&amp;) Among the Chinese the Communist Party of China is active and till latelywas allowed considerable scope by the French, who hoped to play the Communistsoff against theKuo Min Tang, but late in 1948 the French changed their policy andbesides closing one or two centres in Cholon expelled some fifteen leaders.2. (a) The Viet Minh is said to have a membership of 4,000, but there are numerous affiliated peasants, probably amounting to some hundreds of thousands.(b) The Chinese Communist Party probably number about 5,000.3. (a) Of the total population of French Indo-China, the Viet Minh partyamounts to 0 - 017 per cent., but Of the total population of Vietnam (i.e., Indo-Chinaexcluding Cambodia and Laos) about 0-021 per cent.(&amp;) The Chinese Communist Party numbers about 1 - 5 per cent, of the Chinesepopulation as recorded in the census, but the census figure includes only Chinesewho are foreign nationals.4. The Viet Minh claims to have held elections and to have secured 90 percent, of votes cast.5.   The Viet Minh National Assembly is dominated by the Communists.6. There are no Communists in the French-controlled Provisional CentralGovernment, but six of the Ministers of the rebel Viet Minh administration areCommunists.7.   See paragraph 4 above.8. The Viet Minh army, which is controlled by a Communist commander,numbers about 85,000.There is said to be an organisation in France which persuades communists in the French forces to volunteer for service in Indo-China and then to desert tothe Viet Minh, but no numerical estimate of such.desertions is available.9. Outside the towns controlled by the French, such police as exist are saidto be effectively controlled by the Communists.10. There is a Leftist tendency among the indigenous civil servants, but it isnot possible to estimate how many are Communists. Outside the areas held bythe French, the administration is dominated by the Communists.11.   There is little trade union activity.12. The Viet Minh leader, Ho Chi Minh, has visited Russia on more thanone occasion; he also worked with Borodin in China and was connected with theschool for revolutionaries, organised by Borodin, at Whampoa, near Canton.Other Viet Minh leaders have similar records.13. The Viet Minh has military training camps in Siam; arms are receivedfrom both Siam and China. The Viet Minn has representatives in Bangkok,Rangoon, Calcutta and Paris, and the Viet Minh News Service has offices inRangoon, Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Chinese Communists main-tain contact with the Party in China.14. Most Annamites are anti-Communist and the grant of a real measureof independence by the French might destroy Communist influence, which atpresent depends on Viet Minh&apos;s claim to represent Annamite nationalism. but unless such a settlement is arrived at by the French, it is quite likely that the Viet
Minh will succeed in gaining control of the whole country and setting up a communist Government throughout Indo-China. In the latter case, Communistfifth-columnism would, of course, be superfluous; in the former case the Com-munists might be a danger to the stability of the independent Vietnam State.INDONESIAI. The Dutch have proscribed Communism, but Communist Parties wererecognised by the Republican Government.The orthodox Communists rebelled against the Republican Government inSeptember 1948 and were crushed; but the Trotskyist leader, Tan Malakka, thenformed a new &quot; Partai Moerba &quot; (Proletarian Party) which received the approvalof the Republican Government.2. Estimates of the number of Communists have varied from as little as,000 to as many as 125,000 (including 25,000 Chinese); the higher figure, derivedfrom Dutch sources, is certainly much exaggerated.3. Taking the maximum estimate of 125,000 the percentage of communists in the population is -18.4.   No electorate has yet been defined.5.   No national Parliament now exists.6.   There are no Communists in the Dutch Administration.Some of the members of the late Republican administration have in the pastdisplayed sympathy with Communist ideas; e.g., Dr. Hatta, late Prime Minister,is said by the Dutch to have attended the School for Revolutionaries at Tashkent,but he is not now a Communist.7.   There have been no elections.8. There is no evidence of infiltration into the Dutch or Dutch-controlledforces.* Communist influence was reported to be strong in the Republican army andsome desertions occurred at the time of the Communist rebellion in September1948, but most of the army remained loyal to the Republican Government. the republican army appears now to have dissolved owing to the recent action of theDutch.9.   No reliable evidence is available about communism among the police.10.   No reliable evidence is available about communism in the civil service.II. According to Dutch reports the Sobsi (central organisation of labourersin the Republic) and the Sarboepri (organisation of agricultural unions in theRepublic) were dominated by Communists; these two organisations controlledsome 2,500,000 workers.  The future of these organisations is now in doubt.12. The leaders of the rising in September 1948, Moeso, Soeripno andAlimin, all had direct contact with the Russians Moeso and Alimin in moscow and Soeripno in Prague.Tan Malakka has also been in Russia, but his Trotskyist tendency probablyimplies that he now has no Russian connexions.13. (a) The Indonesian office in Prague has been in contact with Com-munists there.(&amp;) The Czech Consul in New Delhi is said by the Dutch to be the channel of communication between the Indonesian office in Prague and Indonesia.(c) The Dutch state that the Indonesian Communists maintain contact withRussia through Dr. Soedarsono, Republican representative in New Delhi, andalso by means of wireless.(d) An Indonesian delegation attended the Congress of the World Federa-tion of Democratic Youth in Warsaw in August 1948.(e) Indonesian students are in touch with the International Union of students.(/) The Republican information service in Amsterdam is reported by theDutch to be partly staffed by Communists.(g) There is certainly communication with Communists in Australia, whenceCommunist literature is obtained.
(A) Propaganda material is said also to reach Indonesia through the philippines.it) There is contact with the Gommunist Party of Malaya.(j) The Dutch state that Communists in the British forces of occupation in1945-46 did much to encourage communism in the Indies (as certainly was thecase in Burma also); the connexion thus established is no doubt still maintained.(k) The Indonesian news service in Bangkok has its office in the samebuilding as the Viet Nam news service.14. Though the Dutch issue alarmist reports, it appears that so far com-communism has made little appeal in Indonesia, where the powerful Masjoemi(Muslim) Party is anti-Communist. Communism has little hold outside some ofthe towns and the recent rebellion against the Republic was easily crushed. Itis, however, possible that the collapse of Republican ambitions may driveinfluential nationalists into the Communist camp through a sense of frustration as has already occurred with, for example, Sjarifoeddin. If this should occuron any scale, communism might be a real danger to the future United States ofIndonesia.japan. There is a legal Communist Party in Japan. It was banned before thewar, but was reborn in 1945 when General MacArthur ordered the release ofpolitical prisoners in Japan.2.   Reported membership figures are: March October1947            1948 1948Registered members ...      ...    16,200 18,088 ?Unregistered (covert)......        300 47,000Adherents (approx.) ... 80,000 ... 100,000Total ...      ...    96,500 18,088      c. 165,000There are indications that since November 1948 many covert members haveopenly entered the party and registered so as to give the impression of rapid growth.   Recent figures are not yet available.3.   165,000 forms -20 per cent, of the population of 80 million.4.   The same figure forms -40 per cent, of the electorate of 40 million.5. Communist representation in. the House of Councillors is 4 members or1 - 6 per cent.Communist representation in the House of Representatives has risen as aresult of the elections of 23rd January, 1949, from 4 (-86 per cent.) to 36 members(7-7 per cent.).6.   There are no Communists in the Cabinet.7. In the general election of 23rd January, 1949, the Communist vote isreported as 9 - 5 per cent, of votes cast or about 6 - 7 per cent, of all eligible voters.In the local elections for the new Boards of Education held on 5th October, 1948,where the Communists prophesied their own success they secured only 2 of the296 seats. In the general election of 1947 they obtained 3-4 per cent, of the votes.In the local elections at the same time they obtained 1 per cent. It seems, estab-lished. that many voters who will vote for a little-known Communist in a largeconstituency will not vote for a known local Communist in a minor local election.8.   There are no Japanese armed forces.9.   Communist influence in the police is negligible.10. Communist influence in the Civil Service is exerted through the Govern-ment workers&apos; trade union organisations. Of these unions, the GovernmentRailway Workers&apos; Union (Kokutetsu Rodo Kumiai) has not&apos; fallen underCommunist domination although strenuous efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to extend Communist influence. The All-Japan Communication
Workers&apos; Union (Zenkoku Teishin Rodo Kumiai) is Communist dominated. Inthe Central Executive Committee of the Japan Teachers&apos; Union only 9 of the81 members are openly Communists, although in some matters this Union followsthe party line.11. Of the six million odd union members in Japan, divided among thousands of Unions, some 1 - 2 million (June 1948) are subordinated to the National congress of Industrial Unions, in which the rigid Communist central control has provokedthe creation of a powerful anti-Communist &quot; Democratisation League &quot; whichhopes in the course of time to wean much of the membership away from theCommunist leading minority. The other large organisation, the General Federa-tion of Trade Unions (1 million members, June 1948), has not been seriouslyinvaded by the Communists and remains associated with the Socialists. Of theunaffiliated unions, only a few have been subjected to serious Communist infiltra-tion. The rank and file even in the N.C.I.U. are not, in intention, supporters of communism.12. Some Japanese Communist leaders visit the Soviet Mission in Tokyo.Others are believed to keep in more constant contact with Tass representatives,who are themselves in close touch with the Soviet Mission. Only seven of theparty headquarters&apos; staff appear to have lived in Russia.Direct contact between the now Soviet territory of Sakhalin or the southernKuriles and Hokkaido is also alleged to exist.Further contact appears to be maintained via North Korea, although thereis no proof that this channel provides more than a means of smuggling goods which are sold for the benefit of the party.13. Contact is close with the powerful &quot; League of Koreans Residing in japan &quot; and it is assumed that through them contact is maintained with the korean Communists. The war-time residence of Nozaka, one of the two chiefJapanese Communists, in Chinese Communist territory suggests that some Chineseconnections are also maintained.14. The Communists are well placed and organised for attempts to sabotageJapanese industry, but on the other hand the occupation forces and the Japanesepolice have had such ample opportunities for intelligence of Communist organisa-tion and plans as to enable them to take effective counter-measures before anyforeseeable emergency. In Hokkaido the Communists possess some &quot; strong-arm &quot;bands and many of the 600,000 Koreans in Japan can, if required, be stirred upto violence in the Communist interest. Nevertheless the great majority of japanese distrust the Russians, dislike Communism and would, in an emergency,co-operate with the occupation forces, with the police or with their own Govern-ment to curb any serious attempt by the Communists to subvert law and order.SOUTH KOREA1. There is a legal Communist Party in South Korea, but, owing to theopprobium which its actions have brought upon it, it has changed its name tothe &quot; South Korean Labour Party.&quot;2.   The Party consists of : 1(a) Agents of the &apos;&apos; North Korean Labour Party &quot; or of the Russians, somesent from the north, others recruited locally.(&amp;) Their paid supporters.  Crowds at Leftist demonstrations have been paid at the rate of 200 yen per head for one attendance.(c) Volunteers who hope to increase their power by supporting the Party.(d) Convinced Communists.The excesses committed by the Party have reduced this last category tonegligible dimensions. The other groups are variable in size, especially the paidsupporters. In May last year more than 75 per cent, of the electorate voted fornon-Communists. The remainder of the electorate included supporters of the Leftand Centre Parties (who boycotted the election) besides those who were unableor too indifferent to vote. The Communist supporters were also among those who
did not vote and thus clearly formed an extremely small proportion of the electorate at that time, almost certainly less than 5 per cent., and possibly lessthan 1 per eent.*3. See under (2) above. The Communist proportion of the total population is probably less than 3 per cent, and possibly less than 0-7 per cent.4. See under (2) above. The Communist proportion of the electorate is lessthan 5 per cent, and possibly less than 1 per cent.5. There are no overt Communists in the new South Korea elected Assembly.On controversial matters, however, a number of representatives will usually vote in the Communist interest and a small number of these may be either in sympathy with or in the pay of the Communists.6.   There are no Communists in the Government.7.   Figures for Communists in local councils are not available.8. At the time of the Yosu revolt the &quot; constabulary &quot;-the embryonic armed forces-were; found to be inefficient owing not only to inadequate training butalso to Communist infiltrations.9. Some sections of the police have shown themselves to be devoted to Right-wing politicians and they are generally opposed to the Communists with whom they have had many fights. A recent report, however, states that evidence nowexists of Communist infiltration into the police. This infiltration neverthelessseems still insignificant; and during and since the Yosu revolt in efficiency andloyalty they have contrasted favourably with the constabulary.10.   Figures for Communists in the Administration are not available.11. In the Trade Unions the Communists have been active and have succeeded in imposing themselves on a number of factories. The Right-wing has done the same and is believed to control rather more workers than the Communists.The latter have used their power almost entirely for political and subversivepurposes, causing riots in Seoul and other towns as well as on the railways. Owingto the agricultural nature of South Korea the effectiveness of these tactics hasbeen limited.12. The leader of the South Korean Labour Party lives in North Korea tomaintain better contact with his Korean and Russian masters as well as for hisown safety.One of the major plots in South Korea was organised by M. Shabshin, directorof the Political Department of Soviet Headquarters in North Korea, while hewas a guest in the American Zone as a member of the Soviet Delegation to theJoint Commission.13.   Contact with Chinese Communists is via North Korea.14. The only weakness of this Party as a fifth-column in South Korea lies in the antipathy it has aroused among the local population. Its greatest successso far has been in Quelpart Island (Korean : Cheju; Japanese : Saishu) where inMay rioters succeeded in upsetting the elections in two of the three electoraldistricts. It is doubtless no mere coincidence that the only two districts in whichCommunists were strong enough to achieve this were in an island of great strategicvalue to Russia.The Yosu revolt in the south-west, which started on 18th October, 1948, was virtually quelled in ten days. Since then there has been steady armed infiltrationin the mountain ranges across the 38th parallel. Official estimates of the extentof this and other subversive activity are violently contradictory and unreliable. Ingeneral, however, it is clear that despite many grave political and economicweaknesses, which could of themselves injure or destroy the Republic of Korea,the specifically Communist danger lies not with residents in the southern territory-ries, but with the agents, arms, money or troops which the Russians or the KoreanCommunist Government may send in from North Korea: These are alreadyproducing a simulated &quot;fifth-column&quot; which is claimed by the Communists to* The only figures available for Party strengths in South Korea are those supplied by the parties.Their total much exceeds the total population, and the Communists&apos; figures are at least as unreliableas those of other parties.36805 g
presage a general revolt. Its artificial nature, however, distinguishes it sharplyfrom the normal conception of a &quot;fifth-column&quot; as a subversive movementorganised on a basis of spontaneous enthusiasm for an alternative regime on thepart of sections of the resident population.PHILIPPINESI. In 1932 the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the CommunistParty to be an illegal association. Since the war the party has existed openly butthe distribution of propaganda is punishable and Communist literature is apparently seized by the authorities.The main strength of Communism in the Philippines lies, however, in theHukbalahap and P.K.M. organisations, in which the Communists hold importantpositions and wield considerable influence. These organisations were declaredillegal under the late President Roxas and the amnesty granted them on15th April, 1948, under President Quirino expired after four months without having produced any permanent change in their status.2. Membership of the P.K.M. (National Peasants&apos; Union) is reported as150,000 and of the C.L.O. (Congress of Labour Organisations) as 80,000, but onlya proportion of these are Communists or even specifically Communistsympathisers;3. Since the total population is 19 million, the Communists constitute lessthan 1 per cent. Sympathisers with the agrarian unrest led by the Hukbalahapsand to some extent influenced by the Communists may at times have amounted to10 per cent.4.   See the preceding paragraph.5. The Democratic Alliance (an organisation of the &quot; Popular Front &quot; type,now defunct) won 6 seats out of approximately 100 in the House of Representa-tives elections in 1945, but information is not available on whether any of the six representatives were avowed Communists. Luis Taruc, Commander-in-Chiefof the Hukbalahap, finally took his seat on 26th June, 1948, as a result of the amnesty. He left Manila again for the mountains in early August after publiclyaffirming his own Communism while denying allegations that the Hukbalahapand P.K.M. were Communist organisations. The legislature appears to containno other Communists.6.   There are no known Communists in the Government.7.   Figures of voting in recent elections are not available.8. There are no known Communists in the Government forces, though thereare some American deserters in the Hukbalahap forces.9.   There are no known Communists in the Police.10.   There are no known Communists in the Civil Service.II. The Philippines are not highly industrialised, but such Trade Unionsas there are are strongly influenced by the Communist-dominated Congress ofLabour Organisations. This, however, affects the city of Manila rather than thecountry as a whole. Its membership has been reported as 80,000, but more recently as between 30,000 and 50,000. The President is believed to be a &quot;fellow-traveller,&quot; while one of its Vice-Presidents is Secretary-General of the CommunistParty of the Philippines.12. Although Communist leaders in the Hukbalahap are reported to receivemoney from Russia, their chief sources of funds appear to be banditry, blackmail,the Chinese Communists and American Communist or Left-wing organisations,in the order given.13. The Chinese in the Philippines provide links with the Communists inChina. The American Merchant Marine is reported to bring $6,000 monthlyfrom the Communist Party in America, who also lend occasional public moral support to the agrarian revolutionaries in the islands.
14. The Hukbalahap is a powerful, armed guerrilla organisation formerlycontrolling some four rice-growing provinces north of Manila in central Luzon.It was created to fight the Japanese, but has subsequently fought the Government.It resisted efficiently till this summer though the range of its activity was slowlybeing narrowed. Its inspiration and strength were in the endemic agrarianunrest. Its arms were acquired from American wartime supplies to guerrillas,and increased by captures from the Japanese and by other nefarious means. Someof its leaders were Communists and Communist experience was reflected in theform of the organisation. It is, however, doubtful whether the members wouldever have fought for any motive save their own profit or agrarian reform.Communist efforts to organise a United Front in politics had some successduring the war, but none thereafter. The more ambitious Democratic Alliancewhich followed showed less Communist influence in its leadership and organisation; it has also dissolved.The latest organisation, the P.K.M., seems little more than a political counter-part to the Hukbalahap forces, operating within the radius of Hukbalahapprotection. It has shown much Communist influence (its flag is red with a whitescythe and the letters &quot; P.K.M.&quot;) and it purports to set up a complete, systemof central and local government on semi-Communist lines.Among the semi-literate peasantry Communist political ideals are slow totake root, and the only ally on whom Russia might be able to rely within the philippines would seem to be the Hukbalahap. So long as the guerrillas couldbe made to feel that they were fighting for their own interests against the usurersand grasping landlords they would be likely to accept alliance with, and someguidance from, the Communists. Under a threat of Russian or chinese communist domination their reactions would almost certainly be different.SIAM1.   The law banning Communism was repealed in 1946. ^ ;(a) Nothing was heard of any Siamese Communist Party till August 1948,though one or two Siamese, men without influence or reputation, professed Com-munist views. In August 1948 information was received of the existence of aSiamese Communist organisation with headquarters in Bangkok and branchesin twelve provinces, chiefly in the towns of north-east Siam; but the existence ofthis organisation remains unconfirmed.There is a Siamese newspaper, the Mahaohon, of Communist sympathies, pub-lished weekly in Bangkok, and the weekly Kana Sangkom Niyom (i.e., Socialism) ispro-Soviet.(6) The Chinese Communist Party is active among the Chinese of Siam inBangkok and the north-eastern towns.2. (a) The Siamese organisation was reported to have 3,560 members, theleaders being half-Chinese or half-Indo-Chinese, mainly journalists, lawyers orteachers; the pure Siamese element was not strong.(b) The Chinese Communist Party has probably about 2,000 actual Partymembers, though their numbers have been estimated at as much as 5,000.3. (a) Membership of the Siamese organisation is about 0-03 per cent, ofSiamese.(b\ Chinese Communists form about 0-05 per cent, of Chinese population of siam.4.   The number of Communists among the electorate is negligible.5.   There are no Communists in the National Parliament.6. The present Government is anti-Communist and has deported a number of chinese agitators.7. No Communist votes have been recorded in recent elections.8. Communism has no influence in the armed forces.9. Communism has no influence in the police.10.   Communism has no influence in the Civil Service.
11. The Chinese Communists have much influence among the Central LabourUnion, which is mainly Chinese; Chinese Communist agents have much influence in general among the coolie labour at the docks and rice-mills of Bangkok and couldincite a strike of about 100,000 persons.12. The Russian Legation, established in Bangkok in 1948, is believed to bein contact with local Communists, but has so far been cautious in its relations withthem; the Legation&apos;s press service issues material to the Siamese newspapers, butthere is no evidence that money passes. There are persistent reports that youngSiamese have been sent abroad, perhaps to Russia, for training in Communisttechnique, but it is possible that these are really only Free Siamese who have gone to China.13. (a) The Siamese Communist organisation is believed to be in contact with the Communists in French Indo-China.(b) The Chinese Communist Party in Siam is an off-shoot of the Party inChina and appears to be in contact with Chinese Communists throughout South-East Asia. ;Chinese Communists from Malaya take refuge on the Siamese side of thefrontier, and armed Chinese Communists are reported to have gone to the frontier to assist in the Malayan troubles, but this last point is not confirmed.14. (a) Amongst Siamese, fifth-columnist activity is unlikely.(6) Amongst Chinese, Communist agents, by arousing agitation among thecoolie labour in Bangkok, could dislocate the economy and life of the capital, whichare all-important to the welfare of the whole country.The Chinese Communists would also probably be willing to aid the FreeSiamese against the present Government in the hope of thus creating a state ofchaos.(c) The Malay separatist movement in South Siam is believed to be non-Communist, but the movement might see advantage in aiding the chinese communist operations along the frontier if it despairs of achieving its aimsotherwise.
