ANNEXGERMANY : INDUSTRIAL DISARMAMENTAgreement has now been reached with the United States and French Govern-ments on the twin questions of reparations and prohibitions and limitations on german industry. Both questions have been the subject of a long controversy,-which has bedevilled relations between the three Governments and created serious administrative and psychological obstacles for us in the administration of western germany. That an agreement has been reached is, therefore, a matter for satis-faction in itself. Moreover, the two Agreements, taken together, are believed tosafeguard our essential security objectives while, leaving place for a healthyexpansion of the German economy over a wide field.2. One of our main objects throughout has been that these two matters shouldbe settled together. This was not merely a question of tactics; we wanted to liftboth out of the field of controversy before a West German Government was set up.We had some difficulty in persuading the Americans to agree to a joint negotiation,and it was only after several weeks of argument on this procedural question thatthey consented to do so. In the event, our insistence on a joint negotiation hasbeen justified.3i So far as reparations is concerned, the question at issue has been to obtain agreement between the three Governments on the. basis of the recommendationsof the Humphrey Committee which was appointed last autumn to advise Mr. Hoff-man, the Economic Co-operation Administrator, in fulfilling his responsibilityunder Section 115f of the Economic Co-operation Act This section reads asfollows : &quot;The Administrator will request the United States Secretary of state to obtain the agreement of those countries concerned that such capital equip-ment as is scheduled for removal as reparations from the three Western zones of Germany should be retained in Germany if such retention will most effec-tively serve the purposes of the European Recovery Programme.&quot;4. The Humphrey Committee examined 381 plants in the three zones, andafter informal discussions in London last December decided to recommend theretention in Germany of 167 of these plants. The outcome of the negotiationsjust completed is that the French Government and ourselves have agreed to theretention in Germany of equipment in 159 of these plants, while the remainder(see Appendix A), which includes some plants of great imnortance, such as theHamborn steel works, and whose value is 30 per cent, of that of the whole 167plants, will be released for reparations. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to persuade the Americans to release the Deutsche Edelstahlwerke, the importantelectric steel mill at Krefeld, to the removal of which from Germany both theFrench and ourselves attached great importance. Apart from this, however, thesettlement on the basis of the Humphrey Committee Report represents a reasonablecompromise between security considerations and those which inspired Section115f of the Economic Co-operation Act. The principal sufferers by the Agree-ment are likely to be the members of the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency entitledto reparations, who were led to believe some eighteen months ago that all theseplants would be allocated for reparations in due course; and no public announce-ment of the details of the agreement is being made until a meeting of the Assemblyof the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency has been called. This will probably takeplace on or shortly after 7th April.5. The major questions discussed during the recent negotiations related,however, to the prohibited and restricted industries. The history of this matter is long, involved and unsatisfactory. A large number of industries were pro-hibited or limited in March 1946 in pursuance of the Potsdam Agreement. Whenthe reparations list was drawn up for the Anglo-American Zones in pursuance ofthe Anglo-American level of industry plan of August 1947, General Clay refusedto reconsider the future of the prohibited industries or to agree to the removal of surplus equipment from prohibited industries and the whole question of whatwould remain effectively prohibited in the future was thus thrown into uncertainty.From September 1948 to January 1949 efforts were made between the three36846 b
Military Governors and their representatives to reach agreement on future pro-hibition and limitations, but these efforts broke down largely because the americans insisted on a complete removal of the ban on shipbuilding, while theFrench, and to a lesser extent we ourselves, sought to retain the prohibition andrestriction of a large number of small industries of commercial value to Germany,but of some significance from a security point of view.6. The recent negotiations in London were conducted on the principle thatit would be desirable to concentrate prohibitions and restrictions on a relatively small number of more important industries. As a result of the application ofthis principle some thirteen industries have been completely freed from restriction.Steel remains unaffected that is to say, the maximum production permitted con-tinues to be 11-1 million ingot tons per year. The prohibition of synthetic oiland synthetic.rubber, including the removal of co-polymerisation and butadiene-making facilities, means that we have gained our most important security objec-tives in these fields; and the prohibition is not without commercial significance.We have been unable to meet the wishes of the Departments concerned in thematter of machine tools and tractors of over 150 h.p., but it had been obvious fromthe outset that we were unlikely to get our way on these matters.7. In the supremely important field of shipbuilding we have secured anagreement which safeguards our essential security interests. We have persuadedthe Americans to remove as reparations all shipyards in excess of a shipbuilding capacity of 277,000 gross registered tons a year; and to agree that Germany shallnot be allowed to construct any seagoing vessels until her coastal fleet is completed.The German requirement of coastal shipping is estimated at 517,000 tons. Wehave secured American agreement to our speed limits for German ship construction and they have come very close to our figure on tonnage limits. In return we haveconceded to Germany the right to purchase ships up to, and in the case of tankersslightly above, those limits before the coastal fleet is completed, but not in excessof a total of 100,000 tons in the case of tankers, and 300,000 tons in the case ofdry cargo ships for the period of the Agreement. In return for giving Germany. permission to obtain a limited number of second-hand ships in the fairly near&apos; future, we have set a limit both on the size and speed of ships Germany may buildand on the total amount of shipping she can acquire over the next four years which in other circumstances the Americans would certainly not have beenprepared to concede.8. There was considerable argument about the duration of the Agreement.The Americans wanted it to last for three years and then to terminate unlessrenewed. The French would have preferred that it should continue indefinitelyunless modified by agreement. Neither of these solutions would have beenaltogether satisfactory. We cannot now foresee how the conflicting factors of security or German economic health will be in balance in four years&apos; time. Theprovision relating to the duration of the Agreement as it has finally emergedanticipates a continuation of prohibitions until the peace treaty together with a review of limitations which will lapse at the end of 1953 if not renewed byagreement in the latter half of 1952.9. The text of the agreement on prohibited and limited industries is contained in Appendix B. It will be seen that it needs to be translated into a formal agreement by the Military Governors. No public announcement will bemade until about 8th April, when it is hoped that this operation will have beencompleted.10. It would be foolish to suppose that the terms of agreement on thesetwo subjects will be welcomed either in Germany or in Western Europe. TheGermans, although some of them may be gratified at the removal of certainrestrictions and the retention in Germany of many plants, will draw attentionto restrictions which have not been removed and to the number of plants remainingon the reparations list. The French Government may be subjected to some criticism, particularly from the Right, for having agreed to a substantial measureof relaxation and to the retention in Germany of over 150 plants. Such reactionsare inevitable. The virtues of the agreement are that it will remove reparationsfrom the sphere of debate in Congress, where it might in the future, as in thepast, have become involved with E.R.P. appropriations; that it can be defendedin France as in this country as a compromise which safeguards essential security
interests; that it does not impose an unreasonable burden of prohibitions andrestrictions on Germany at a time when so much importance attaches to securingwhole-hearted German co-operation with her Western European neighbours;that it provides for its own revision and modification in the light of changing circumstances, but &quot;without introducing restrictions so temporary as to be worth-less; and that it has removed a source of international controversy on the eve ofthe signature of the Atlantic Pact, and at a moment when we are about tojoin in the building of a new policy for Europe of which the Pact is the corner-stone.2nd April, 1949.APPENDIX AGERMANY: REPARATIONSRecommendation concerning the Retention in Germany- or Removal as reparations of the German Industrial Plants Listed by the HumphreyCommitteeWe, the undersigned, recommend to our respective Governments that theUnited,States, French and United Kingdom Military Governors be instructedin accordance with the terms of the attached statement; which is drawn up inthe English and French languages.United States French United kingdom delegation Delegation Delegation31st March, 1949.Statement :concerning the Retention in Germany or Removal as Reparationsof the German Industrial Plants Listed by the Humphrey CommitteeThe Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United Statesagree that, of the 167 plants reviewed and to which reference is made in the note of the United States Government of 25th January, 1949, the following plantsshall be dismantled and removed for reparations, and all others shall be retained in Germany on the grounds that in their present location they will more effectivelycontribute to European Recovery : Steel 1.   and 1320   Bochumer Verein Gusstahlfabrik, Bochum.2.   and 1324  August Thyssenhutte, Hamborn.

The Military Security Board will ensure that obsolete or worn-out plant or equipment, the replacement of which by new has been licensed, is removed from Germany or destroyed.
1. The construction of ships whose size or speed does not exceed the limitscontained in the following table shall be permitted in Germany, provided that noocean-going ships shall be constructed until a German coastal fleet adequate forthe requirements for European and German recovery has been reconstituted.(It has been estimated that Germany will require for this purpose 517,000 G.R.T.,including 360,000 G.R.T. of.dry cargo ships.)Dry cargo ships : 12 knots, 7,200 G.R.T. (being not less than 10,800 dwt.).1 Tankers : 12 knots, 7,200 G.R.T. (being not less than 10,800 dwt.).Small craft (including fishing vessels): 12 knots, 650 G.R.T.

In order to provide guidance for the Military Governors, a Committee of experts shall forthwith be constituted by the three Governments with instructionsto prepare, within three months, a report outlining the types of ships, excludingships primarily for passengers, which may be required by Germany, although theyexceed in one respect or another the limits in paragraph 1 above. The committee shall also determine those features of design, construction, propulsion machinery,&amp;c.,, which would facilitate use for or conversion for war purposes or which donot conform to normal merchant marine practice and should therefore be pro-hibited. The recommendations of the Committee shall be transmitted to theMilitary Governors through the Military Security Board for action in accordancewith the procedure outlined in the following paragraph.4. The Military Governprs, acting upon the advice of the Military SecurityBoard, may permit by licence the construction or acquisition of ships exceedingin some respects the limitations on speed and tonnage snown in paragraph 1 above,in order to provide for ships having special purposes or functions. The military governors shall take into account the requirements of security and the necessitythat ships shall be capable of operating economically in the trades or routes forwhich they are intended.5. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the military governors, acting upon the advice of the Military Security Board, shall beempowered to authorise under licence the construction of vessels having a greaterspeed than 12 knots that are shown to be essential for such purposes as the pre-vention of smuggling and illegal fishing, frontier control, fire fighting, or for theuse of pilots or the civil police.6. The Military Governors shall promulgate the legislation necessary to giveeffect to the foregoing provisions; and upon the coming into effect of such legis-lation the operation of the relevant provisions of Control Council DirectivesNos. 33, 37, 44 and 45 shall be suspended. Until the promulgation of such legis-lation, the building of any ships other than those permitted under the relevant provisions of Control Council Directives Nos. 33, 37, 44 and 45 shall remainprohibited.Article XIINothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as impairing or reducing thepowers with which the Military Security Board is vested.
