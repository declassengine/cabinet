PHIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      j Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1949SECRET Copy-No, .31CP. (49) 103  -6th May, 1949&apos; - CABINETPREPARATION OF LEGISLATION FOR THE 1950 session memorandum by the Lord President of the Councilh The Committee on Future Legislation have considered what preparatory work should now he put in hand on Bills for the 1950 Session, which, under present plans, will run from January, 1950, until the Dissolution of Parliament.2. In view of the relatively small number of days which will be availablein both Houses for legislation, only a small programme can be contemplated.No proposals for major Bills were received from Departments; and, indeed, itwould be impossible to find time for major measures, other than the Iron and&apos; Steel Bill, if this should fail to pass during the present Session. A few medium-sized Bills are urgently required and have been included in the proposed programme.   We also suggest that the programme should include a number of, small non-contentious Bills which, if passed, will facilitate administration but which can be omitted, if circumstances so require, without undue inconvenience.3. We consider that Bills (other than essential Bills) should not be consideredeven tentatively for inclusion in the programme unless they can be ready for-introduction as soon as the House assembles in January, 1950. It will, therefore,be essential for Ministers to obtain early approval for the policy underlying anylegislative proposals, where this has not already been obtained, and to ensure-that full instructions are given as speedily as possible thereafter to parliamentary counsel.4. After consultation with the Ministers concerned, we have reached theconclusion that it will not be practicable to legislate in the present parliament on the following subjects which were at one time put forward for consideration :-Agricultural Drainage (Scotland).Dentists.Ferries.Form of Government Accounts.Law of Defamation. *, Limitation of Actions.Naval Reserves.Preservation of House of National Importance.Public Order (Scotland).5.   On this basis we recommend that the provisional Programme for the, 1950 Session should be : (a) Essential BillsFinance.Isle of Man Customs.Army and Air Force (Annual).Public Works Loan Board.Post Office and Telegraph (Money).-  (&amp;) Major BillIron and Steel (if not passed this Session).36988
(c) Medium-sized BillsNewfoundland (Consequential Provisions).General Medical Council. -   .!Police Pay and Conditions of Service.Court-Martial Procedure.(d) Minor Bills, to be introduced if time permitsIndian and Colonial Divorce Jurisdiction Acts (Amendment).Public Libraries, Museums and Art Galleries (if policy if approved).Midwives,Yorkshire Potash Deposits Exploitation.Distribution of Industry Act (Amendment).Local Authorities Loans Act, 1945 (Amendment).Borrowing (Control and Guarantees) Act (Amendment).Fiduciary Note Issue.(e) Consolidation BillsCustoms and Excise Acts (Consolidation).Notes on these Bills are set out in the Appendix.   There, may also be one ortwo Bills left over from this Session&apos;s progranr j? 6. Since the length of the Session is uncertain we shall be even less able thanin the past to give definite promises that Bills, which are tentatively approved for inclusion in the programme, will in fact be introduced. That should not deterMinisters from making sure that an adequate number of Bills are drafted. Ifthey are not introduced in the 1950 Session they will he available for later Sessions.;.. 7, As oh preyious occasions the mention of a Bill in this memorandum should not be regarded as authorising the Minister concerned to anticipate theKing&apos;s Speech for the next Session by promising that the Bill will be introduced in the life-time of the present Parliament.8. Because of the short length of the Session we recommend, without pre-judice either way to practice in the next Parliament, that no time should be madeavailable in the 1950 Session for Private Members&apos; Bills.9. The Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, and theDefence Regulations retained under it, expire on 10th December, 1950J but canbe continued in force thereafter from year to year by Order-in-Council made inconsequence of Addresses in both Houses. Similarly, a miscellaneous collection ofDefence Regulations remain in force till 10th December, 1950, by virtue of theEmergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947, and can be continued byOrder-in-Council made in consequence of Addresses. The tidy arrangement would be for legislation to be passed in the 1950 Session putting into permanent -form the war-time powers which are still required; but we consider that this wouldbe impracticable. If it does not prove to be practicable to pass such legislation at the beginning of the next Parliament, it will be necessary to move Addressesin the autumn of 1950 for the continuance of the two Acts for a further periodof a year. We have arranged for the official committee concerned to prepare proposals for handling the situation; and meantime there is everything to be gained by making permanent, without delay, powers which will be requiredindefinitely, as is proposed by the Treasury in respect of &quot;borrowings and thefiduciary note issue. &apos;   .10.   To sum up, the Cabinet are invited : (1) To agree that, pending the formulation of a final legislative programme for the 1950 Session, work should proceed with a view to the prepare-ration of the Bills listed in paragraph 5. / .(2) To authorise the Committee on Future Legislation to review from time totime the progress made with the preparation of legislation for the 1950Session and to make such minor adjustments in the provisional programme as may seem desirable.(3) To agree that time should not be made available in the 1950 Session for private Members&apos; Bills. --H.
