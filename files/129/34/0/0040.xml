(THIS TOGUMENT^IS^THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49)  IIP13TH MAY, 1949CABINETAUSTRIAN treaty memorandum, by the Secretary of statefor. Foreign AffairsThe Foreign Ministers&apos; Deputies for the Austrian treaty, who have &quot;been sitting in London since 9th February,suspended their discussions on 10th May, in accordance witha proposal put forward by the United States Deputy and supported by his British and French colleagues.2. The history of the Austrian Treaty negotiationshas been set out in four papers which I have submitted overthe past eighteen months:    O.R.c(47) 47 of 24th November,1947, CP. (43) 9 of 4th January, 1948, CP. (48) 102 of8th April, 1948, and CP. (49) 15 of 20th January, 1949.    Inthe last of these I expressed the belief that the Austrianquestion was not one which the Soviet Government were likelyto be prepared to settle in isolation from wider questions.The negotiations during the past throb months tond to hoar outthat belief.   Neither on the two main obstacles to agreement -the Soviet claims to &quot;German Assets&quot; and the Yugoslav claims(supported by the Soviet) to territory and reparation from austria - nor even on the minor unagreed articles of theTreaty has the Soviet representative, M. Zaroubin, shownhimself ready to make any real concessions.   My colleagues may recall that the 1948 Conference of the Deputies broke down on the issue of the Yugoslav claims.   The Westerndelegations therefore concentrated on this question whendiscussions were resumed this year.    Further hearings weregiven to both Yugoslav and Austrian representatives, and a real effort was made by us both in and outside the conference to find a basis on which satisfaction might be given toany genuine Yugoslav grievances- but which did not involvechanges to Austria&apos;s frontiers or the payment of reparation.However, the Yugoslav delegate, who was careful to keep instep with M. Zaroubin at every stage, would not withdraw hisdemands.    Tho Soviet Deputy, while continuing to support these demands,  showed tliat he was less interested in the well-being of the Slovene minority than in pressing a bargaining counterfor his Government.   He refused,  for example, to consider apractical British proposal for safeguarding tho, rights of theSlovene population in Austria.    On the other main question,German assets,  the Soviet have refused to reduce their demands in any way.3. In the circumstances the American, proposal for ashort adjournment was the only practicable coarse.   In making-it,  the United States Deputy suggested that theJDeputiesshould fix a date for resumption at the end of June.    in themeantime, he suggested that the four Deputies should reportto their respective Ministers and hold themselves in readinessCOPY NO.31

to renew their meetings during the  forthcoming paris conference of the Council of Foreign Ministers, if requiredto do so.   Although the Soviet Deputy raised someopposition to the proposal, which appeared to take him bysurprise, he eventually accepted it.4* I circulate the above account for the informationof my colleagues.    I do not wish in this paper to discussthe Question whether, and if so how,  the Austrian Treatyquestion should be raised in the Council of foreign ministers.   For the moment, tho agenda for that conference has been confined to German questions.   We are,  however,  fullyalive to the possibility of bringing up the Austrian treaty should the circumstances seem favourable.E.B.Foreign Office, S.Wtl.,13th May, 1949*
