Also attached (Annex B) are some details of the incident,not intended to be included in the statement to Parliament,though certain points may have to be brought out in answer to questions which may be raised there.SHANGHAI3.      The rapid advance of the Communist armies and the politicalsituation aroused by the AMETHYST incident also raise certain questions of urgency in connection with ouj? policy in Shanghai.Three telegrams which have been received from H.

112ANNEX ADRAFT STATEMENT1.      The House will wish to have a full account of thecircumstances in which His Majesty&apos;s Ships were fired, upon in the Yangtze river with grievous casualties and damage.2.      I will first explain what.our position is with regardto the civil war in China.      It has been repeatedly stated inthis House that our policy has been governed by the MoscowDeclaration of December 19U5 in which the United Kingdom,the United States and the Soviet Union declared a policy ofnon-intervention in Chinars internal affairs. -   In view ofthe considerable- British interests in China and of thepresence of large British communities, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decided some months ago that His Majesty&apos;ambassador and His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers in China should remain at their posts and this was announced to the House by my Rt. Hon. Friend in December.      In the disturbed conditionswhich have prevailed in recent months, warships were stationed at Shanghai and Nanking in the event that a breakdown of lawand order as the result of hostilities should require the^m toassist in the evacuation of British subjects.3.      I should make it clear that the stationing of these ships and their movements from one port to another in china were undertaken with the full knowledge and consent of theNational Government of China.      I want to make the pointtherefore that when the incident took place to which I amabout to-refer H.M. S.  &quot;Amethyst&quot; was proceeding on herlawful occasions and that there was no other properlyconstituted authority to whom His Majesty&apos;s Government were under an obligation to notify her movements even had they beenin a position to do so.h.      Early on Tuesday, 19th April the frigate U. M.S.   &quot;Amethyst&quot;(Lieutenant-Commander Skinner) sailed from Shanghai for Nanking.The objects of her passage were to relieve H. M. S.  &quot;Consort&quot; atNarking,  to provide communications for His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,to bring supplies for the British community and to be preparedto carry out their evacuation if need arose.      A warship has infact been maintained at Nanking for a considerable time andpassages have been fairly frequent.5.      The opposing Chinese forces have been massed along the. banks of the Yangtse for a considerable time and there have been repeated rumours during recent weeks that the Communists were about to cross the river.      The passage of the &quot;Amethyst&quot; was accordingly adjusted to meet the military situation.Arrangements were made at the time to avoid the expiration ofa Communist ultimatum to the.effect that in circumstancesthey would cross on 12th April.      Nevertheless, the necessityfor relieving H.M.S.   &quot;Consort&quot; as early as possible remained;she was -running short of supplies after a long stay at Nankingand a frigate was considered, more suitable for this task thana destroyer.      The second Communist ultimatum was due to expireon 21st April.      The Flag Officer therefore decided, with theagreement of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,  that the passage shouldbe timed to allow the &quot;Amethyst&quot; to reach Nanking a clear2k hours before the expiry of this ultimatum.      &quot;Amethyst&quot;should therefore have reached Nanking on 20th April.      For thesame reason the &quot;Consort&quot; was due to leave before &quot;Amethyst&apos;s&quot;

113arrival.      An intelligence report was received on the 19thwhich confirmed 21st April as the date for the Communistcrossing; hy the time &quot;Amethyst&quot; received this she was already half-way up.the river.      In the light of these facts the decision for &quot;Amethyst&quot; to sail was made and thisdecision was in my opinion correct..6.      What could not have been foreseen before the incidentsv/as the repeated and deliberate attacks by massed artilleryon the four warships, and on the Sunderland Plying Boat,whose neutral character and peaceful intentions were allfully known to the Communist forces.      For example, both&apos;&quot;London&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot; were prominently displaying whiteflags.      Perhaps the high light of humanity was the machine-gunning of the men being disembarked from the &quot;Amethyst&quot;under the white flag, many of them seriously wounded, orwhile still swimming in the water.      The same policy appearsto be reflected in the refusal of the Communist authoritiesin Peking even to receive a letter from His Majesty&apos;s Consulasking them to order their forces to stop firing and allowour ships to give medical relief and evacuate the wounded.7.    To turn to the narrative of events when &quot;Amechyst&quot; had reached a point on the Yangtse River some 60 miles fromNanking, at about nine o*clock in the morning on the 20th,Chinese time, she came under heavy fire from batteries onthe North bank, suffered considerable damage and casualties and eventually grounded on Rose Island.      After this, the captain decided to land about sixty of her crew, including he-rwounded, who got ashore by swimming or in sampans, beingshelled and machine gunned as they did so; we know that alarge proportion have,  with Chinese help, arrived at Shanghai.8.      Vice Admiral Madden,  the Flag Officer 2n3 i/c Far EasternStation ordered the destroyer H.M.S.  &quot;Consort&quot; (CommanderRobertson) from Nanking to go to &quot;Amethyst&apos;s&quot; assistance,and the frigate H.M.S.   &quot;Black Swan&quot; (Captain Jay) from shanghai to Kiang Yin, I4O miles down river from the &quot;Amethyst&quot;.9.      &quot;Consort&quot; reached &quot;Amethyst&quot; at about three in the afternoon and. was immediately heavily engaged.      She found the fire too hot to approach &quot;Amethyst&quot; and therefore passed herat speed down river.      She turned two miles below and againclosed &quot;Amethyst&quot; to take her in tow.      But she again came under such heavy fire that she was obliged to abandon the attempt, although she answered the shore batteries with herfull armament and signalled that she had silenced most of theopposition.      Half an hour later her signals ceased, though in fact she was making a second attempt to take &quot;Amethyst&quot;in tow, having turned, down-stream again.      This attempt alsofailed and she sustained further damage and casualties duringwhich her steering was affected.    . She therefore had tocontinue downstream out of the firing area.10.    Meanwhile,  the Cruiser H.M.S.  &quot;London&quot; (Captain Cazalet),v/earing the flag of Flag officer 2nd i/c, was also proceedingup the Yangtse at best speed.11.    The three ships &quot;London&quot;,  &quot;Black Swan&quot; and &quot;Consort&quot;met at Kiang Yin at about eight that evening.      It was foundthat &quot;Consort&quot; was extensively damaged;  she was ordered toproceed to Shanghai to land her dead and. wounded and effectrepairs.

11412.    At about two o&apos;clock in the morning of the 21st the&quot;Amethyst&quot; succeeded in refloating herself by her own efforts and anchored two miles above Rose Island.      She could go nofurther as her chart was destroyed.      Her hull was holed in several places- her Captain severely wounded, her First Lieutenantwounded, and her Doctor killed.      There were only four unwoundedofficers left, and one telegraphist to carry out all&apos;wirelesscommunications.13.    Later the same morning the &quot;London&quot; and the &quot;Black Swan&quot;endeavoured to close the &quot;Amethyst&quot;, but met with heavy firecausing some - casualties.      The fire was of course returned, butthe Flag Officer then decided that it would not be possibleto bring the damaged &quot;Amethyst&quot; down river without further serious loss of life in all ships; he therefore ordered the&quot;London&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot; to return to Kian Yin.11)..    At Kiang Yin they were fired upon by batteries, and suffered considerable casualties and damage.      Both shipsafterwards proceeded to Shanghai to land their dead and wounded and to effect repairs.15.    That afternoon a Naval and a R.A. F.  Doctor, withmedical supplies and charts, were flown by a Sunderlandaircraft of the Royal Air Force to the &quot;Amethyst&quot;.      Both the &apos;aircraft and the &quot;Amethyst&quot; were fired upon.      The ship was hit,but the Sunderland managed to transfer the R. A.F. Doctor andsome medical supplies before being forced to take off.      The&quot;Amethyst&quot; then took shelter in a creek.16.    During the night of the 21st-22nd &quot;Amethyst&quot; succeeded in evacuating a further batch of her wounded to a nearby town.After doing so, she moved 10 miles up river under cover ofdarkness, though under rifle fire from the banks, and againanchored; she then completed the landing of all her more seriously wounded,  including her Captain.      I am sorry to saythat this very gallent officer, who had insisted on remainingwith his ship up to this time, died of his wounds soon after.There remained on board three R.N.  officers,  1 R.A.F. Doctor,52 ratings and 8 Chinese.      At about this time Lt.  Cdr. Kerans,the Assistant Naval Attache at Nanking, reached the ship andassumed command.17.    Another courageous effort to reach &quot;Amethyst&quot; was made bythe R.A.F.   in a Sunderland on the afternoon of the 22nd.  butthe aircraft v/as driven off by artillery fire withoutsucceeding in making contact.      The &quot;Amethyst&quot; then moveda further four miles up river.      She was in close touch withthe Flag Officer, and after a number of courses had beenconsidered it was decided that she should remain where shewas.18.    Perhaps I may at this point anticipate two questionswhich may possibly be asked.      First, how was it that.M. Ships suffered such extensive damage and casualties,and second, why they were not able to silence the opposingbatteries and fight their way through.      In answer to thet?irstj, I would only say that Warships are not designed to

operate in rivers against massed artillery and infantrysheltered by reeds and mudbanks.      The Communist forces,appear to have been concentrated in considerable strengthand are reported as being lavishly equipped with Howitzers,medium artillery and field guns.        The above facts also provide much of the answer to the second question onlyI would add this.      The Flag Officer&apos;s policy throughoutwas designed only to rescue H.M.S.   &quot;Amethyst&quot; and to avoid unnecessary casualties.      There -was no question of apunitive expedition and H.M.  Ships fired only to silencethe forces firing against them.1-9.    I will at this point briefly summarise the losses and damage which resulted.The casualties were:-H.M.S,   &quot;London&quot;;       13 killed.    15 wounded.H.M.S.  &quot;Consort&quot;;     10 killed.      k seriously wounded.H. M. S.   &quot;Amethyst&quot;;    19 killed.    13 wounded.H.M.S.  &quot;Black Swan&quot;; 7 wounded.In addition, an unknown number of the crew of H.M.S.&quot;Amethyst&quot; may have been killed or wounded while theywere swimming ashore; some 10 ratings are still missing.Of the damago to the ships, the &quot;London&quot; suffered themost severely, having been holed repeatedly in her hulland upper works.     The damage to the &quot;Consort&quot; andthe &quot;Biack Swan&quot; was less serious.      &quot;London&quot; and&quot;Black Swan&quot; have already completed their emergencyrepairs.      The &quot;Amethyst&quot; suffered severe damage but was.repaired by the efforts of her own crew to be capableof- 17 knots.20.    The House will wish to know whether any steps were taken by our authorities in China to make contact withthe Communist authorities.      Some time has lapsed sinceCommunist forces overran Mukden, Peking and Tientsinwhere we have Consular posts.      His Majesty&apos;s consular officers at these posts have been endeavouring for sometime past to reach day-to-day working arrangements withthe local authorities.      Their approaches have, however,been rejected on every occasion without any reason being given for such rejection.

21.   When H.M.S.  &quot;Amethyst&quot; was fired upon &quot;by Communist forcesH.M.  Ambassador instructed H.M.. Consular Officer in charge at peking to communicate to the highest competent chinese communist authority by whatever means possible a messageinforming them of this and seeking the issue of immediateinstructions by them to their Military Commanders along the Yangtse to desist from such firing.    A subsequent messageemphasised the urgent need of medical attention of the casulties and reiterated the request for instructions to &apos;prevent further firing upon these ships of the Royal Navyengaged in peaceful and humanitarian tasks.   The localCommunist authorities, however, refused to accept the Consul&apos;sletters.22.    At this time Mr. Edward Youde,  a Third Secretary inH.M. Foreign Service who has a good knowledge of Chinese,volunteered to try and contact the Communist forces north of Pukouin the hope of reaching some Commanding Officer with sufficientauthority to stop the firing.   H.M. Ambassador agreed to this attempt and Mr. Youde passed through the Nationalist lines onthe night of 21st April.    Thanks to his courage and determination Mr. Youde succeeded in reaching the forwardheadquarters of the People&apos;s Liberation Army in Pukou area on23rd Aprili   He described the situation as he knew it when he left. Nanking on 21st April and pointed out to them the peaceful and humanitarian nature of the mission of H.M.S. &quot;Amethyst&quot;and requested that she be allowed to proceed to Nanking orShanghai without further molestation.    Their headquarters took the line that clearance had not been obtained from the People&apos;sLiberation Army and that she had entered the war area.    they also complained of heavy casualties incurred by their troops asa result of fire from H.M.  Ships.    They refused to admitjustification or self-defence.   After consulting higher authority the headquarters stated that in the circumstances they would beprepared to allow the ship to proceed to Nanking but only on condition that she should assist the People&apos;s&apos; Liberation army to cross the Yangtse.    Such a condition was obviouslyunacceptable.23*   M&apos;y attention has been drawn to- a communique broadcast bythe Communists which said that on the date in question warshipson the Yangtse opened fire to prevent its crossing by communist forces.    It v/as not imtil the following day that theylearned that these ships were not all Chinese but that four british ships were among them.    The Communists state that their forces suffered 252 casualties as a result of this firing andclaim that His Majesty&apos;s Government have directly participatedin the Chinese Civil War by firing on Communist positions.These *laims are, of course, so far as they relate to HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the Royal Navy,  as fantastic as theyare unfounded.2k.    If there was any initial misunderstanding as to the nationality of H.M.S.  &quot;Amethyst&quot; this would have been speedilyresolved had the authorities in Peking acted on H.M.  Ambassador&apos;message.    Moreover, had the Communist authorities objected inthe past to the movement of British ships on the Yangtse it was always open to them to raise these through our Consularauthorities in North China.    It is the fact that for reasonsbest known to themselves the Communists have failed to notifyany foreign authority present in areas which they have occupied of the channels through which contact can be maintained and that they have rejected all communications made to them.    Inthese circumstances His Majesty1s Government can only reserve their position.

A i r-11125o   The House will wish to join me in expressing sympathy with the relatives of all those who have been killed orwounded in this-action and in expressing admiration of thecoixrage of all those who took part in it.   Four names deservespecial tribute.    Lt. Commander Skinner, R. N., the Captain ofthe &quot;Amethyst&quot;,  and Lt. J.C. Weston, R..N. his First Lieutenant,(who for a short time succeeded his Captain in command of theship) lost their lives through their devotion to duty.   Bothwere severely wounded but remained at their posts, fighting and manoeuvring the ship&apos; and removing the wounded to safety.Both left the ship too late to receive effective surgical aidfo r themscive s.26.   Telegraphist J.L. French showed superlative devotion to duty.   He was the only telegraphist left in the &quot;Amethyst&quot;after the early hours of 21st April;    and from then onwardshis efforts kept the ship in almost continuous communicationwith Shanghai. &apos;27* The fourth name is that of Mr. Youde, whose one man missionthrough the Communist Armies I have already described.28.   Without a doiibt .many other cases of bravery and devotionwill be revealed when all the facts are known.    But we already have ample evidence that the conduct of the whole ship&apos;scompany of H.M.S.  &quot;Amethyst&quot; was beyond all praise, though aconsiderable proportion were young sailors under fire for thefirst time.   We have had reports of seamen and marinesremaining at their task for up to 2k hours though badlywounded,  and of men declining to have their wounds treateduntil cases they considered more urgent had been dealt with.I have heard too that in H.M.S.  &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot;,,when there .was a possibility of volunteers being flown to&quot;Amethyst&quot;;, there was almost acrimonious rivalry forselection, - as.they put it &quot;to go back for more&quot;.29j    In conclusion, I should mention that the United states naval authorities at Shanghai placed their resourcesunstintingly at our disposal,  and the kindness and help of theBritish communities at Shanghai have been beyond all praise.Finally, the Chinese Nationalist, forces in Chinkiang area were most helpful in providing medical aid and stores which theycould ill afford.   The House will join with me in expressingour gratitude to all of these.

ANNEX BSUPPLEMENTARY wwiaalgence of Communist plans3*      AMETHYST*S position- on-22nd April and after.--.To retan to the AMETHYST &apos;S narrative.   By the afternoon of the 22nd she had reached a fairly safe position.   Pourpossible courses of action were considered.Her Commanding Officer held himself ready to follow any of these courses.   Reports which began to come in of the crossing of communist troops above and below her position meant that attempts to reach Shanghai or Nanking at this time would almost certainlyend in disaster.    Further damage might sink the ship;    the crew though in good heart were physically exhausted and of coursedepleted in numbers;    navigation of the Yangtse is alwaysdifficult and virtually impossible at night;    the radar and gyrocompass were out of action and the magnetic compass doubtful.The courageous Captain v/as unwilling to abandon his ship untilthe result of the approach of a mission sent to the Communistsshould be known;    there was also, a possibility that the ambassador himself might negotiate a safe passage with theCommunist authorities at a later stage or even that the shipmight slip down later, after the crew had been rested and the armies had completed their crossing.   She was now in acomparatively safe position and in fact was only fired on twicein the next 1+8 hours.   So she remained where she was, shiftingberth slightly on two occasions.ho      Risks attendant on passage of the Yangtse,The passage has always been regarded as one of some risk incase irresponsible elements ori-&quot;either bonk opened fire.  Nevertheless, theNaval Commander-in-Chief decided that, since there had been no opposition or protests on either side and since our aim waspeaceful, the passages should be continued until it became apparent they would be opposed;    I full:/ endorse his decision.  -(a)Ob)(Q)(a)to stay where she wasto attempt to get dov/n river to Shanghaito attempt to get up river to Nankingto abandon the ship

inThe House will of course appreciate that if during these monthspassages had been stopped because of the uneasy situation, or because of individual scares,  (of which there were many), therequirements of the Embassy and the British community in Nankingwould not have been met.    The Navy has always been prepared, andI hope will always be prepared, to take justifiable risks incarrying   out its tasks.5*     Have the Americans or French recently had warships at nanking?,/It is not known whether a U.S. warship has been at Nankingin recent weeks.    Information is being urgently obtained throughthe   U.S. Naval Attache^There are no indications that a French warship has been at nanking in the last 6 weeks.Both the Americans and French have ships at Shanghai    - -(Woosung).6e      Why was air cover not provided?Air cover would have been inconsistent with the peacefulintent of H.M.S. AMETHYST.In fact, air cover would not have been available.Beaufighters from Singapore could not have arrived beforeTuesday, 26th April.7,      Why is Admiral-Brind still in London?The Commandor-in-Chief was paying a special visit by air toEngland to attend exercise Trident with other Commanders-in-Chief .    This visit was arranged last January.    His presence inLondon has been most helpful in the handling of the situation.Arrangements have been made for his return by air on Thursday,several days earlier than originally intended.If he had returned at once&apos; he would have been of no serviceeither in the Admiralty or on his station while on passage atthis critical time.    The Admiralty has complete confidence inVice-Admiral Madden, his Second-in-Command.8.      Did the Nationalist forces fire on H.M. Ships?-  We are advised that they did not.90      It is undesirable for security reasons, to give a detailedexplanation of the AMETHYST&apos;S present condition and possible courses of action, unless the AMETHYST1S position has    -substantially altered by the time this statement is made.

ANNEX  copy OF TELEGRAMFROM H.M.  AMBASSADOR.  NANKING,  TO FOREIGN office no.k89 dated 20th April.  1 QUoT :120In so far as political considerations are concerned, i feel that the withdrawal of the   warships at this momentwould he unfortunate in view of the attitude of the communists as contained in statement quoted in my telegram k88.   We have maintained that the presence of these ships in Chinese waters is for peaceful and humanitarianpurposes.    Their withdrawal now might undermine the validity of our case as well as increase local panic.It is vital that all three Governments concerned(United States, French and His Majesty&apos;s Government) shouldtake similar action.    My French colleague is inclined tothink that the ships should be maintained until definite decision regarding evacuation of foreign nationals isreached and acted upon,  and should then be promptlywithdrawn.   In view of the recent developments, I agreewith this proposal and consider it undesirable forH.M.  Ships to be in Shanghai when the Communists arrive.    Ihave consulted my Commonwealth colleagues who are incomplete agreement.&apos;   I will try to consult my United Statescolleague in the course of the day.3.     I fully endorse the view of His Majesty&apos;s ConsulGeneral Shanghai set.forth in paragraph 3 of his telegram 79 to me.ii.      It is too early to judge from their actions herewhat are the attitude and intentions of the Communists.ANNEX DCOPY OF TELEGRAMFROM CONSUL-GENERAL,  SHANGHAI. TO FOREIGN office no.238 of 20th April. 1 9k9*Communist comment as made here says that at first theships were mistaken for Nationalist vessels but that later itwas realised that they were British ships sent (sic) tointerfere with the crossing in the interests of the nationalists.    It claims that our ships fired first of all,and that Communists suffered 262 casualties &quot;for which british Imperialists will be held responsible&quot;.2.      I do not admit this as meaning that the Britishcommunities here or elsewhere will suffer reprisals, but ifthe Communists do come quickly to Shanghai they may arrive inangry mood with British in general and Royal Navy inparticular.    It is,  of course, probable that their arrangementsfor crossing at one point in question were effectivelydisjointed.3.      I submit that from the political angle it is out ofthe question to think now of bringing troops from Hongkong toassist in any evacuation -and I shall advise the Emergency Committee in that sense unless otherwise instructed.    I amshowing this telegram to Admiral Madden.k.     Any guidance you can give me about the attitude orintentions of the Communists will be welcome.-9-

ANNEX copy OF TELEGRAMPROM FLAG OFFICER,  SECOND IN COMMAND.FAR EAST,  TO admiralty concur that troops   cannot- now he used with advantage.2.     In any case it seems probable that there will not now beany time for the ordered plan for evacuation to be used.3*     Consul-General informs me that he is arranging for voluntary evacuation of non essentials by commercial seapassage and aircraft and anticipate that this new plan doesnot need Naval aid. -k*     It seems that the presence of Warships at Shanghai canonly be an irritant to the Communists when they arrive andthat they may constitute a   positive disadvantage to theBritish Community.5*     I therefore intend to reduce the number of Warships at shangai immediately by sailing SHOALHAVEN for Kure tomorrowMonday and CONSTANCE for the Chusan Archipelago on thefollowing day. &apos; -6.     The departure of LONDON and BLACK SWAN must depend oncircumstances, but I intend to avoid if possible, the risk ofbeing locked in by. Communist control of the river.    I have littleinformation as to rate of advance of Communists but it seemsvery rapid indeed.7*     Consul-General agrees that ships should not remain inthese circumstances.    I shall remain in the vicinity.8.      I have exchanged views on this subject withComnavwestpac who holds similar view that this risk must notbe run.
