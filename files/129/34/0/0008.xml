this DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1949SECEETC.?. (59) 786th April, 1949CABINETPREVENTION OF CORRUPTIONMemorandum by the Attorney-general  wish to suggest to my colleagues the desirability of a small proceduralchange in the law which would apply to corruption in connection with publiclicences and permits the same rules of criminal procedure as have long beenapplicable to similar corruption in connection with Government contracts. my proposal has the approval of the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the lord chief Justice and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It follows that all thosewho are concerned in England with the enforcement of the law consider it a desirable change in the existing procedure. I regret that the Lord Advocatedoes not concur in this view, but as there are, of course, many differences betweenthe laws of England and Scotland I would not myself wish to press for legislationapplying to Scotland, where I have no responsibility for enforcing the law.2. Corruption is an exceedingly difficult offence to prove, partly because there are rarely any witnesses other than the actual parties to the allegedly corrupttransaction, and partly because it is necessary to establish not only that money or some other consideration was accepted by a servant or agent, but that it was offered or accepted corruptly, that is to say, with the wrongful intention of influencing or rewarding the conduct of the servant or agent concerned. It is always very difficult to prove intention. As was said in one of the old cases,&quot; the mind of man is not triable; the devil himself knoweth not the mind ofman.&quot; If the onus rested upon the prosecution to establish the corrupt intent,prosecution could rarely succeed, since the prosecution cannot call the allegedoffender as a witness..3. To meet this situation the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1916, providedexpressly that, where &quot; it is proved that any money gift or other consideration hasbeen paid or given to or received by a person in the employment of His Majestyor of any Government Department or a public body by a person or agent of aperson holding or seeking to obtain a contract from His Majesty or any Govern-ment Department or public body, the money gift or other consideration shall bedeemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly . . . . unless thecontrary is proved.&quot;4. At the time of this enactment corruption in connection with licences issued by Government Departments or local authorities had not arisen as a serious danger, but in these days of economic and other controls licences and permits mayhave a very considerable financial value, and there can be no doubt of the tempta-tion to offer and accept inducements or rewards in connection with their issue.In the absence of a presumption corresponding to that which exists in the caseof contracts, however, the proof of such offences is usually a matter of the utmostdifficulty and sometimes of impossibility.5. I accordingly suggest that Parliamentary Counsel should be asked to draft a simple Bill applying the provisions of the 1916 Statute to cases of permitsand licences as well as of contracts. A one-clause Bill would seem to be sufficient.Copy No. 3136849
6.   As I understand them, the possible objections to the proposal are these : (i) That to place the onus on the defendant is contrary to the general principle of English law.It is true that the general rule throws the onus of proof on the prosecution, and this rule is not less important because the present parliament has departed from it without any qualms in many cases,of which all the Nationalisation Acts are examples and the Red PetrolAct is a high-water mark. It has, indeed, been recognised from timeto time in regard to particular statutory offences, the commission ofwhich constituted a public evil, that, so far as concerns matters whichare in the ordinary way exclusively within the knowledge and controlof the defendant, the onus of proof may be laid upon him. this principle led to the provision in the Prevention of Corruption Act,1916, and the present proposal is a logical adaptation of that provision to existing circumstances. While the onus as to intent is thus thrown on the defendant, the general onus of proof still rests upon the Crown.(ii) That, as the grant of licences and permits is a matter of discretion notrigidly covered by standing orders or other rules as in the case of contracts, it would be more difficult for a defendant to prove that his discretion had not been influenced than in the case of a grant of a contract.It is true that the grant of a public contract usually has to bemade in accordance with well-established rules, e.g., as to lowest tenderopened and so forth. This fact should have made it all the lessnecessary to alter the rules as to onus of proof in connection withsuch a grant, since, if it was proved that a gift had been received andthe standing orders had been departed from, a presumption of corrup-tion would arise without the necessity for any express provision inthe statute, while if the contract in question had been granted strictlyin accordance with the standing orders the question of a corrupt intent,at least on the part of the public employee, would hardly arise. none the less, Parliament in 1916 did find it necessary to make this special provision to facilitate proof of these offences. It is, however, pre-cisely in the case where licences and permits are granted on a dis-cretionary basis that the real opportunity for and temptation tocorruption arise. No such procedural safeguards as protect con-tracts appear to exist, and it is especially the comparatively minorofficials to whom powers to grant licences are delegated who wouldbe protected by the present proposal. I assume that local authorityofficials, like Civil Servants, are forbidden to accept gifts; it can hardly be a hardship upon them if, in the event of their acceptinggifts, they are called upon to show they did so innocently. Moreimportant, however, is the fact that donors would be discouraged from making gifts, the illegality of which to public officials is not yetsufficiently recognised, and, if they gave them and were prosecuted,would have to snow that the gift had an innocent purpose.(iii) That there is no evidence as to the number of cases in which prosecutionshave failed because of the absence of this presumption under the lawas it now stands.Without examining the police files in each particular case it wouldbe impossible to say how often the local police had failed to applyto the Director for my Fiat (which is a condition precedent to anyprosecution for corruption) because of insufficient evidence of inten-tion, nor is there any record showing the number of cases in whichFiats have been refused or prosecutions have failed for this reason.The available statistics do show, however, a tendency for these cases to increase. Thus, in 1937, seventeen cases were reported to theDirector for my Fiat, which was granted in seven cases. In 1946,thirty-seven cases were reported to the Director and my Fiat was granted in twelve cases. In 1947, eighty-five cases were reported butonly fifteen Fiats could be granted. In 1948 eighty-seven cases were reported and twenty-one were the subject of Fiats. The number ofcases known to the police was, of course/much larger.
7. I do not propose that members, as opposed to employees of localauthorities, should be brought within the scope of the suggested amendment ofthe law, although I should perhaps say that the Lord Chief Justice considersthat this ought also to be done.8. It should be added that there is little practical risk of the law as amendedbeing abused. Before any prosecution for corruption can take place it has topass through the filter of the Director of Public Prosecutions and thereafter ispersonally considered by the Attorney-General before a Fiat is issued. Prosecu-tions in respect of trivial gifts, a lunch and so forth, do not occur.9. The Director has reported that the effect of the 1916 Act, &quot; by demon-strating that the accepted commercial practice of making presents often ex postfacto to those who had assisted in securing contracts did not apply to Govern-ment contracts, was substantially to protect Government servants from temptationswhich had previously been placed in their way, often without sinister intent, bycontractors.&quot; I believe that, in view of the expansion of our controlled economy, asimilar protection to those concerned with the issue of licences would be welcomed by the public as an indication of the Governments determination to stamp out the increasing evil of corruption.&apos; H. S.Law Courts, W.C. 2,6th April, 1949.
