PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT^ ^S E 0 RE T   -&apos; 1 -1CP. (49) 8k COPY NO.IL/9TH APRIL. I9k9CABINETTHE MEAT ration memorandum by the Minister of Food......1 1&quot; &apos;&quot; -   1      i ini     i        ii1. When I reported to the Cabinet on 10th March(C*M.(ij.9) 19th Conclusions, Minute 5) on the meat situation,I said that I would examine the position again early in April &apos;in the light of the progress of negotiations in Buenos Aires.2. The meat supplies at present in sight from home production and from countries other than the Argentine should enable us to hold the present carcase ration until the end ofMay, but we shall need about 30,000vtons of meat to arrivehere in May and Juno, over and above those supplies, if we areto be able to avoid a further cut in the ration at the end ofMay.3* In two respects the outlook is more hopeful than itwas a short while ago:-(a) About 33,000 tons of frozen pork is said to beavailable in the United States.   In pursuance of the authority given by the Economic Policy Committee at their meeting on2hth March (E.P.C.(i4-9) 9th Meeting, Minute 5) we propose topurchase this quantity with some of the E.C.A. dollar fundswhich would otherwise for various reasons have to be carried over from the second to the third quarter of the current year.We are attempting to clear our position with E.C.A. and ifwe can do this, procurement should get under way at the beginningof next week.   We shall hope to ship as much of this pork aspossible to arrive here during the next two months, but until more is known.about its whereabouts, condition, etc., it isimpossible to estimate how much will in fact arrive duringthe critical period before the end of May.(b) There is now good reason to hope that if therehave been no difficult developments in the negotiations for anew agreement, the Argentine authorities will agree to loadsome meat during April on the ships which we have engaged forthis purpose.   Here again, however, it is impossible to say-how much will in fact be shipped, although our representatives in Buenos Aires have estimated that it might amount to15,000 tons.k* In view of these possibilities there is no need forme to ask my colleagues at the moment for any decision as to thefuture of the ration.    I will circulate a further paper after easter, when it will be necessary to decide whether, in view ofthe continuing depletion of stocks, the issue of the 2d. canned corned meat ration should be maintained.   But the decision onthis will be affected by the position then reached in theArgentine negotiations and on other factors such as the possi-bilities of continuing purchases of frozen pork from theUnited States.Ministry of Food, S.W.I.,9th April, 19^9*J .S *
