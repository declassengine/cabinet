DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1949SECRET Copy.life 31CP. (49) 83Wth April, 1949CABINETOVERSEAS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT-COMMITTEEORGANISATIONNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe Prime Minister has approved the revised Committee organisation set out below for the interdepartmental examination of matters concerning overseaseconomic development.2. The four different aspects of this problem will be considered in the firstinstance by the following four official Committees : (i) The Committee on Colonial Development will deal with economic development in the Colonies. Economic development in african territories which are not British Colonies will also come within theirpurview in so far as the development of these territories bears on thedevelopment of British possessions in Africa; the Committee will not,however, deal with questions affecting the Union of South Africa,Egypt, the Sudan, Ethiopia or the former Italian Colonies.(ii) The Sterling Area Development Working Party will be renamed theCommonwealth Economic Development Committee and will deal witheconomic development in the seven fully self-governing countries of theCommonwealth and Southern Rhodesia.(iii) The Middle East (Official) Committee will deal with economic develop-ment in the Middle East countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, the. Sudan and the former Italian Colonies in Africa.(iv) The Far East (Official) Committee will deal with economic development in the Far Eai^-ra^d*Soirth-E^j^a:&quot;&quot;!r-lrwtH absorb the activities ofthe existing South-East Asia (Food Supplies) Committee. The South-East Asia (Food Supplies) Committee will be wound up.3. There will, inevitably, be some overlapping in the work of these fourCommittees. Thus, it is not possible to exclude from the scope of the Far EastCommittee all questions of economic development in British Colonial territories in that area if only because those territories draw their rice from Burma andSiam. Similarly, the Middle East Committee should not be precluded from con-sidering the problems of Cyprus, Aden and British Somaliland in so far as theyare relevant to the economic development of the geographical area with which theyare dealing. On the other hand, the Colonial Development Committee must beable to consider the problems of those Colonies in the context of Colonial develop-ment as a whole. Again, the Far East (Official) Committee will need to take someaccount of the economic position of India, Pakistan and Ceylon; but the general problems of economic development in those countries cannot on that account beremoved from the scope of the Commonwealth Economic Development committee this theoretical overlapping cannot be avoided. It will rest with the official committee on Economic Development (see paragraph 5 below) to ensure that thework over the whole field is distributed among the four Committees in the most effective way.36863
4. In view of the additional functions assigned to them arrangements arebeing made to reconstitute the Middle East (Official) Committee and the Far East(Official) Committee.5. Co-ordination of the activities of these four Committees in the economicfield will be the responsibility of the Official Committee on Economic Development.This Committee will consider the total amount of resources to be devoted to over-seas development and will ensure that these are allocated to the best advantageamong the various claimants; and it will also relate this overseas development to capital investment in the United Kingdom. The Committee will also take accountof any investment in other parts of the world (e.g., South America) not covered byany of the four subordinate bodies.6. For the exercise of these new functions the Official Committee on economic development will hold separate meetings at which only those Departments with an interest in overseas economic development will normally be represented. TheChief Planning Officer will take the Chair at such meetings.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th April, 1949.
