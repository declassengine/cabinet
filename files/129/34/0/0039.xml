IfITHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 7 2C,P. (49) 10912th May, 1949CABINETEIGHTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL OFTHE UNITED NATIONSNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a report on the EighthSession of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The UnitedKingdom Delegation was led by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Mr. Mavhew).E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,12th May, 1949.annex report on the Eighth Session of the Economic and Social Council, New York,7th February to 18th March, 1949The Eighth Session of the Economic and Social Council, in contrast to pre-vious experience, completed its work within the scheduled time, due, in part, tothe good humour and genial coaxing of the new President, Mr. James Thorn (NewZealand), but mainly to the trivial character of much of the business. An agenda of 53 items was dealt with and the results were for the most part satisfactory fromthe United Kingdom point of view.Economic items.   Economic Development of Under-developed Countries and Technical Assis-tance for Economic Development(a) The General Assembly resolutions on these matters brought the Councilface to face with an issue which it has been evading for the last few Sessions. the already keen interest of the under-developed countries represented on the Council(the Latin-Americans, the Lebanon and India especially) was further heightenedby President Truman&apos;s &quot;fourth point&quot; made in his inaugural speech only amonth before the Council opened. As things turned out the most that the UnitedStates delegation could propose at this stage was that outlines of a programme for technical assistance, including the question of financing by special contribu-tions, be drawn up by the Secretary-General in consultation with the specialised agencies. They made it quite clear that what they envisaged was a united nations and not a United States programme. The immediate reactions of the under-developed countries was probably best expressed by the Indian represen-tative when he implied that President Truman&apos;s &quot;bold new programme&quot; was neither bold nor new nor a programme. It was evident that none of the membersof the Council had had sufficient time to give the question thorough consideration and with the adoption of the United States proposal the Council has given itself the necessary time for further thought and will have a concrete basis for action at its next Session.37031
(b) The debate served a good purpose by drawing a clear distinction betweeneconomic development through international capital movement and economic development through technical assistance, a distinction which the Council for-mally recognised in requesting the Secretary-General to prepare for the NinthSession separate reports on these two aspects of the problem. The general assembly recommendation that the question of economic development be urgentlyconsidered &quot;in all its aspects &quot; was by-passed for the time being at least. Theearly disappointment of the under-developed countries was, to some extent,softened as the debate developed and the practical possibilities of technical assist-ance stood out in sharp contrast to the serious hindrances to international capital movements. A point of interest was that, while the Polish delegation attackedPresident Truman&apos;s proposals on the usual &quot; anti-imperialist &quot; lines, the U.S.S.R.delegation were quietly non-committal. This may, however, have been due to lack of instructions, following the departure of M. Molotov from the SovietMinistry for Foreign Affairs.2.    World Economic SituationA general debate on a Secretariat report on the main economic factors of theprevious year has now become a regular feature of the Council&apos;s work. the debate lasted for some days and contributions were made by almost every memberof the Council. Delegations tended to devote too much time to discussing the economy of their own country in a national rather than an international context.The Slavs led the discussion into the propaganda field with their usual tiradesagainst the Marshall Plan and economic conditions in non-Communist countries,emphasis being laid on trade discrimination against eastern Europe. The UnitedKingdom representative took this opportunity to point to the extreme paucity ofreliable and comparable statistics from Soviet sources. He attributed this ito a desire to keep alive the myth of Soviet pre-eminence in social and economicstandards, as a weapon of political warfare against the West. The U.S.S.R.deleP&quot; Uon made an ineffectual attempt to hide their serious weaknesses on thissc /re and the Council adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution, proposedby the United Kingdom, calling on member Governments to help the Secretary-General in the preparation of his economic surveys by providing as completestatistical information as possible.3.   Regional Economic Commissions(a) The delegation of the Lebanon, supported by Egypt and Syria, who were invited to the Council table, proposed that the question of the establishment ofan Economic Commission for the Middle East be once again postponed on thegrounds that their Governments were still considering the matter in the light of developments in the region. The Council, without debate, postponed considerationuntil the Ninth Session.(b) The interim report of the Economic Commission for Europe, after a quickand quiet passage through committee, was seized upon in plenary meeting by thePolish delegation as a platform for repeating their earlier allegations about tradediscrimination against eastern Europe. A Polish resolution on this subject wassoundly defeated with the Slavs alone voting for it.(c) The report of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East wasthe cause of a much more acrimonious debate. This centred round the EconomicCommittee&apos;s recommendation, based on a United States-Chinese proposal, thatKorea be brought within the geographical scope of the Commission, thereby beingmade eligible for associate membership. (A request to this effect from theGovernment of the Republic of Korea had been received in the earlier stages ofthe Session.) The Slavs, particularly the Poles, vehemently attacked this recom-mendation on the usual political lines. A reference by the Polish delegate to theUnited States Commander in Korea as the &quot; Gauleiter of Southern Korea &quot; raisedstrong objections from Mr. Stinebower, the alternate representative of the UnitedStates, who formally withdrew from the Council table, an action unprecedentedin theCouncil&apos;s history. This &quot;walk-out &quot; would have been more impressive ifit had not been made by one who is generally known to be personally impatientand irascible. The Council eventually amended the terms of reference ox theCommission to include Nepal and Korea in the geographical scope, the formercountry being included at the request of the Commission itself.
Social items. Labour MattersMuch of the remainder of the Council&apos;s time this session was taken up withthe debates on Forced Labour, Infringement of Trade Union Rights, Trade UnionRights (Freedom of Association), and Equal Pay for Equal Work for Men andWomen.(a) The item on Forced Labour, which had been on the agenda of the SixthSession and had been twice postponed, Was originally proposed by the AmericanFederation of Labour, which opened the debate with a well-documented speech.The United Kingdom delegation followed with a detailed and effective attack onforced labour in the U.S.S.R., also drawing attention to similar developments in other countries in eastern Europe. The U.S.S.R. delegation were obviouslydeeply worried by the effect of the United Kingdom speech and, with the Poles,attempted to distract the Council&apos;s attention by long and generally irrelevantspeeches on labour conditions in the United States and the British Colonies.Much of the propaganda advantage gained by the &apos;&apos; Western &apos;&apos; Powers in theearlier stages was, however, lost by repeated postponements of the debate at therequest of the U.S.S.R. delegation. The latter eventually came up with a draft resolution which proposed, under a heavy coating of Communist propaganda,that a large and broadly representative international trade union commission beestablished to investigate working conditions throughout the world. The questionof forced labour was all but lost in the verbiage. For a long time the U.S.S.R.delegation refused to say whether their proposed Workers&apos; Commission couldvisit, among other countries, the Soviet Union. Eventually, under pressure fromthe United Kingdom and other delegates, they admitted that this would not bepossible, &quot; otherwise the report would take ten years to produce.&quot; The U.S.S.R.-proposal was firmly rejected, all except the Slav members voting against it. TheCouncil finally adopted a resolution which, inter alia, invited the InternationalLabour Organisation to give further consideration to the problem of forced labour,and requested the Secretary-General to enquire from member Governments towhat extent they would be prepared to co-operate in an impartial enquiry intothe extent of forced labour in their countries, including the reasons for it and theconditions of work. (In this context it is useful to note that the Slav delegationsmade repeated attempts to obtain a hearing for the World Federation of TradeUnions on this and other items, even to the extent of trying to reverse a Councildecision taken earlier in the Session. Their persistence in this was such as toalienate a number of delegations, who, by reason of their wish to appear neutralor of the continued affiliation of their national trade unions with the WorldFederation (e.g., New Zealand and Australia), had earlier voted for a hearing forthe organisation. The representatives of the W.F.T.U., amongst them M. Saillantand Signor Lombardo Toledano, made little effort to hide their true sympathies,and by the end of the session the organisation had become almost completelyidentified with the Soviet bloc in the eyes of the non-Slav members of the Council.)(b) The item on infringement of Trade Union rights was originally proposedby the W.F.T.U., which presented the Council with extensive documentationalleging repression of Trade Union activities in over twenty countries, a numberof which were represented in the Council. This was supplemented by similarmaterial submitted by the American Federation of Labour, mainly covering thecountries behind the Iron Curtain, evidence which was naturally lacking in theW.F.T.U. documents. The long debate which ensued soon developed into a seriesof allegations, counter-allegations and denials, with a number of non-members ofthe Council taking part. The recent break-up of the W.F.T.U. was not over-looked hy the organisation&apos;s critics. The Slavs followed a strong propagandistline and, by tactlessly associating themselves with the specific allegations of theW.F.T.U., ensured their eventually almost complete isolation in later debates bydriving a number of previously hesitant delegations (e.g., India and the Lebanon,who both came under fire from the W.F.T.U.) from uncertain neutrality intohostility. An anodyne resolution was eventually adopted, drawing the attentionof member Governments to the importance of ensuring the full exercise of tradeunion rights, and transmitting the records of the discussion to the InternationalLabour Organisation, and also to the Human Rights Commission in connexionwith its work on Human Rights Convention.(c) After the traditional Slav attacks on the International Labour Organisa-tion and the rejection of the usual Soviet resolutions on freedom of association
and equal pay for equal work, these questions were satisfactorily disposed offrom the United Kingdom point of view by resolutions which clearly acknowrledged the primary interest and competence&apos; of the International LabourOrganisation in such matters.5. Refugees and Missing Persons(a) The debate on the report of the International Refugee Organisation onthe resettlement of non-repatriable refugees followed familiar lines, with theSoviet bloc accusing the organisation of harbouring war criminals, of baby-snatching and of procuring slave labour. The majority of the Council was sufficiently aware of the hollowness of these charges to make only brief refutationnecessary, and the United Kingdom delegation were, therefore, able to devote agood part of their effort to counter-attacking, mainly on the theme of why thedisplaced persons from eastern Europe were unwilling to return home.(b) Under the item on declarations of death of missing persons, a questionof particular concern to the I.R.O. and to those countries with juridical systemsbased on Roman Law, it was decided to set up an ad hoc Committee of experts to draft an international convention on the subject.6. children the reports on the activities of the International Children&apos;s Emergency fund and on the progress of the United Nations Appeal for Children were dealt withhurriedly in the closing stages of the session. The debate contained faint echoesof the disputes in the Committees of the I.C.E.F. over the geographical distribu-tion of allocations and less praise than usual was showered upon the Fund. Theshift in emphasis in the Fund&apos;s operations away from Europe received dueacknowledgment, and the good work done by the Fund for the Palestine refugees and in Greece was particularly welcomed by the United Kingdom. The debate onthe Appeal reflected the embarrassment caused by the difficulty of putting intopractice the General Assembly resolution on the subject, and the reluctance of most Governments to be committed to a new appeal in 1949.Organisational Matters7. The Council completely revised its Rules of Procedure, increasing theauthority of the President and restricting the opportunities for obstructionism.8. The Council adopted a new Constitution for the Commission on NarcoticDrugs, which will now have a majority of permanent members chosen on thebasis of their special interest in narcotics questions.9. The Council extended the life of the Sub-Commission on Freedom ofInformation and of the Press until the end of 1952, revising the terms ofreference and arranging for new elections to the Sub-Commission.10. On United Kingdom initiative the Council adopted a resolution guidingthe Secretary-General in his task (a) of obtaining the necessary information onimplementation of United Nations economic and social recommendations frommember Governments, and (b) of presenting this information to the Council.The major issue, however, of what the Council can do to encourage compliance with United Nations recommendations, still lies ahead and will need careful inter-departmental study before the next Session.
