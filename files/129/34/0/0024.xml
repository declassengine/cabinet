&apos; /.   124IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(1+9). 9U COPY NO.   Z\26TH APRIL,  19UgCABINETGERMANY - WAR CRIMES policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Bishop of Chichester has put down a Motion on war crimes policy for debate in the House of Lords on the 5th May.I propose that in the debate Lord Henderson should make astatement to the following effect.(.1 )   His Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend tobring to trial in the British zone of Germany any furtherpersons accused of crimes against the laws and usages ofwar apart from trials already begun, including the three german Generals (or such of them as are fit to standtrial).(2)   His Majesty1s Government have already handedover to the Germans the responsibility for trying personsaccused (a) of crimes against humanity where the victimswere Germans, and (b) of membership of criminalorganisations.(3)    In the case of crimes against humanityinvolving an Allied or United Nations victim, HisMajesty&apos;s Government intend to consider in each casewhether the accused should be tried by German Courts underthe German Penal Code or by Control Commission Courts.(h)    In view of their obligations under the MoscowDeclaration Of 191+3 and the resolution of the general assembly of the United Nations in 19*4-7, and of the strong feeling still existing in France and certain other allied countries which were occupied by the Germans, HisMajesty&apos;s Government intend to continue to allowextradition, to the countries where their crimes were committed, of persons against whom a clear prima .faciecase&apos;of murder under the German penal-code can beproved.(5)    In regard to -crimes against peace it isintended&apos; to continue the present policy of bringingno trials before British authorities-.(6)    In the matter of extradition of traitors and   .collaborators, no further applications for extraditionare being accepted by the British authorities since 1st March,  T949.

2.      In the light, however, of the recent agreements on&apos;Germany in Washington, I am anxious that &quot;our policy in thisvexed question of war crimes should, as far as possible,keep in step with the policies    of the American andFrench Governments.       I have accordingly instructed His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Washington and Paris to informthe Governments to which they are accredited that I am anxious to reach very early agreement with them on thepolicy summarized in paragraph 1 above,3,      I do not ask for my colleagues views at the present stage.     My purpose in circ\ilating this Memorandum isto inform them of the line to be taken in the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords.      I will report further inthe light of the discussions with the American and french governments.DISCUSSIONPresent Practice in War Crirae   Casesh.     The British authorities in Germany are at presentacting in accordance with the following instructions inregard to the.various war crimes offences:-(i) Crimes against PeaceNo trials of crimes against&apos;peace have &quot;been or are intended to be brought by British authorities.      (in theUnited States Zone it is understood that no further trialswill take place).(ii) War CrimesIn accordance with the decision of the OverseasReconstruction Committee of 12th April, 19h8, (O.R.C.(k8)1st Meeting, Minute 1 (1 )), no further prosecutions havebeen instituted by the British authorities for violation of the laws or customs of war since 1st September, 19h8,except in regard to the proceedings against the three german Generals.      The three German Generals, or such ofthem as are fit to stand trial, will be prosecuted as quickly as possible, as agreed by the Cabinet on 21st March,  1949*(C.M.(h9) 22+th Conclusions, Minute 2(3)).(iii) Crimes against HumanityAt present, in the British Zone, Control CommissionCourts are continuing to institute prosecutions against persons accused of crimes against humanity involving Alliedvictims;. German courts are trying those involving Germanvictims. &apos;(iv) Persons accused of membership of organisationsdeclared criminal by the International MilitaryTribunalCases under this head are continuing to be tried inGerman Courts. -

(v) Extradition of War Criminals- The Overseas Reconstruction Committee agreed on12 th April (O.R.C. (ii8) . 1 st Meeting, Minute 1(2)) that. thedecision as to the offences for which extradition should hegranted was to, he left to the discretion of the- military governor.     Extradition of persons accused of war crimesamounting to a clear .case of murder committed in the Alliedterritory concerned as defined by the German penal code is continuing provided evidence is submitted to the british authorities bringing a clear &apos;prima facie case.(vi) Extradition of Traitors and CollaboratorsSince 1st March,  19*4-9, no further applications for theextradition of traitors and collaborators are being acceptedby the British authorities.5.    The evolution of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin regard to war crimes&apos; trials is therefore towardsinstructing the British authorities in Germany to ceaseprosecuting war crimes trials on their own account.     It willbe seen that with the completion of the trial of the three german Generals, or such of them as are fit to stand trial,there will be nc   cases remaining in which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are interested on their own account.War Crimes Cases whJoh it is proposed should continue6.    Besides those cases in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare interested on their ov/n account and which are virtuallyat an end, there remain those in which they have inter-national obligations, and,  secondly,  those in which theresponsibility has been handed over to the Germans.7.    Cases in which His Majesty&apos;s Government haveInternational obligations.      Of the cases in which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have international obligations, themost important is extraditon of war criminals to Allies, inregard to which His Majesty&apos;s Government were committed bythe Moscow Declaration of 19*4-3, which provided that theGermans who committed atrocities, massacres and executionsshoiild be sent back to the countries in which theirabominable deeds were done, for trial there.     Moreover, atthe 102nd Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations on 31st October, 1947, members of the united nations were recommended to continue with unabating energyto carry out their responsibilities in regard to war criminals.The extradition of war criminals is still a strong politicalissue in most countries occupied by the Germans during thewar.      The decision of the Overseas Reconstruction Committeeof 12th April, 19*4-8, was not understood to mean that theextradition of war criminals should be brought to an endaltogether.      In effect, as a result of the decision of theMilitary Governor on the authority delegated to him,- itlimited such extraditions to the most serious&apos; offences, namelymurder as defined in the German Penal Code.      It is difficultto adduce strong arguments for putting an end. to theextradition of persons against whom there is a strong-prima facie&apos; case of murder.      I have recently examined there actions likely in foreign countries should we declare anend to- the receipt of applications for extradition whatever the offence.      It is clear that there will be strong protestsnot only from countries east of the Iron Curtain but also

from the French and the Dutch. &apos; A decision by His majesty&apos;s government to accept no more applications for the extraditionof those accused of war crimes amounting to murder would be extremely unpopular among the.general public in.territories in western Europe formerly occupied by the&apos;Germans.     communists and other Iron Curtain elements would make much of it to /augment their party membership, embarrass &apos;their Government and help sow ill feeling among Western Powers.     Moreover, if, inspite of these arguments, it were urged that all such pro-ceedings should be dropped in view of the lapse of time sincethe deeds were committed, I would point out that neither inBritish nor in any Western European territory is it thepractice to allow, as grounds for not prosecuting, the lapse of a long time between the committing and the discovery of amurder.      It is for this reason that I recommend that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should,  subject to the considerationsreferred to in paragraph 9 below, take all steps open to themto ensure that extradition of war criminals, against whom there is prima facie case of murder as defined by the German.Penal Code, shall remain effective.8.    The second type of case in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas certain obligations towards Its Allies is the trial ofpersons accused of crimes against humanity involving Alliedvictims.      It would be undesirable to put an end altogetherto all proceedings against persons accused of crimes againsthumanity, because this would mean putting pressure on theGermans in. regard to a matter for which the responsibilityis solely theirs, namely, cases in which the victims wereGermans. .   It would be equally undesirable if an end were put to all proceedings in which the victims were Allied merely because at the.present time such cases are tried in control commission courts.     This would mean that, whereas a Germanwho had committed an atrocity on another German would be liable to prosecution, his fellow who had committed a similaratrocity on an Allied or United Nations national would avoidliability.      I.suggest to my colleagues that the best way inwhich His Majesty s Government can themselves cease to dealwith cases of crimes against humanity and cause the leastoffence to Allied and German susceptibilities is to leave to german jurisdiction, to be tried as offences against theGerman penal code, those crimes where the victims were allied nationals.      It is possible that the definitions in that,codemight enable an accused person to escape with lighter punishment,but there are legal difficulties which preclude the possibilityof German Courts being given jurisdiction to try such casesas crimes against humanity.      I am informed that since October,191+7, the practice in the United States Zone has been toauthorise German courts to try cases of crimes against humanitywhere the victims were Allied or United Nations nationals, with two reservations;    (a) that the charges should be framed underthe German penal code -and not under Control Council Law No. 10;and (b) that they should not try cases where .ahy United states military personnel were involved.    .In the course of a dis-cussion which took place recently between the legal advisers tothe British and United States Military Governors on future procedure in cases of crimes against humanity, the UnitedStates authorities expressed the view, that they did not wishany public announcement to be made fixing a date after which no further trials would be heard before Control Commissioncourts, and that so far as they were concerned, although theydid not expect themselves to try any more such cases, theypreferred to consider each case as it arose before deciding to transfer it to, a German court.     The French, on the otherhand, were strongly opposed to the transfer of cases of

crimes against humanity to German courts because they are extremely dissatisfied with the way in which cases where the victims were Germans or stateless persons have &quot;been tried by german courts in their Zone and they do not trust thosecourts to try fairly the numerous cases they have in prospect where the victims were Allied or United nation nationals.   . To meet the views of our Allies I have therefore -recommended that Lord Henderson should not announce a fixed date after which no further cases of crimes against humanityshould be tried bv Control Commission courts, but that ineach case of a cJLmre against humanity involving an allied or United Nations victim it should be considered, subjectto the remarks in paragraph 9 below, whether or not the alleged criminal should be tried by the German court underthe German Penal code.9.    I must warn my colleagues, however, that it may not beopen to the future representative of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Germany to ensure the continuation ofextradition as recommended in paragraph 7 or of the trial in control Commission courts of cases of crimes against humanity,involving Allied victims as contemplated in paragrapn 8.War crimes as such are not.included among the subjectsreserved to the Occupation Authorities unless the futureHigh Commissioners agree that these two categories of war criminals fall under the reserved heading of Foreign Affairsincluding international agreements made by or on behalf ofGermany, or possibly under that relating to the security andother requirements of the Allied Forces.      If they are not included under the heading of Foreign Affairs, or security and other requirements,  it will be open to the german authorities to insist upon bringing to an end extradition ofwar criminals and trials of crimes against humanity involvingAllied victims before Control Commission Courts..    The british military Governor should therefore be instructed to ask his .colleagues for such cases to be included under the appropriatereserved heading of the Occupation Statute.10,    Cases in which responsibility has been handed over tothe Germans.      The German courts at present deal with crimesagainst humanity where the victims were Germans and thoseaccused of membership of organisations declared criminal bythe International Military Tribunal.      I am informed that inthe British Zone they have carried out their responsibilitieswith judicial fairness and would resent any pressure from theMilitary Governor which would detract from their responsibilitiesor allow some Germans to ,go free for offences for which otherGermans have been punished.        I have therefore recommendedthat it shall be left to the Germans themselves to decide whether and when they bring to an end their responsibilities for trying persons- accused either of crimes against humanityor membership of organisations declared criminal by theInternational Military Tribunal.(Intld.)

Thetreatment of the subject in the latter note would of course bevery relevant to anyone who was seriously exercised over thematter, and I think that you will probably wish to have a copyof it available for reference as occasion arises.5.    As you will see, 1 have regarded CP. (47) 288 as, for practical purposes, superseded by the consolidated note.    in detail, theposition is that paragraphs 2-11 are covered by CP. (49)95.Paragraph 1 which deals with the co-ordination of policy, is toBorne extent out of date, and the same applies to the Appendixwhich sets l&amp;t the inter-Departmental organisation for eeonomicplanning.

6. We agreed that in the consolidated note it was unnecessary in paragraph 44 which deals with broadcasting arrangements, to make any reference to the arrangements for party political broadcasts originally set out in C.P.(47)63. That note is itself now out of date. The matter of political broadcasts is, however, very much one for the Lord President&apos;s Office to whom it would fall to handle any questions about current practice and arrangements.
