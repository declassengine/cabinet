THE LONDON DOCK strike memorandum by the Horns secretary the Emergencies Committee met this afternoon toconsider the situation arising out of the strike of some7,000 members of the National Amalgamated Stevedores andDockers, which has been joined by some 6,000 members of theTransport and General Workers Union.   I was invited, as chairman of the Committee, to report their recommendations tothe Cabinet.    The Minister of Labour and National service will be furnishing the Cabinet v/ith a statement of theposition from the industrial point of view and will beindicating the measures which he is taking in an endeavourto bring about a settlement.    This memorandum deals with themeasures which will be required if the strike continues.2.     Executive Measures.    The Minister of Labour has already announced today in the House of Commons that the Governmentare determined to take all the steps necessary to maintain the life of the country.    The nature of the strike is such as tomake a firm stand by the Government particularly appropriate.We therefore recommend that the Government should forthwithannounce its intention, unless the strikers return to work within a very short period, of employing members of the armed forces for the purpose of keeping the port of London going.3. So far as concerns food in particular, it would bepossible, despite the strike, to carry on without furtherunloadings of non-perishable goods to the end of the month,and of perishable goods till 23rd April,   This is on theassumption that the strike does not spread meantime to otherports or to other groups of workers such as cold storage men.There can, however, be no question of relating any government action to food alone.   Pood may be stowed below other formsof cargo which must be removed first.    In any case other formsof cargo, and the turn-round of ships, ure vital to the national&apos;well-being.k* Men and transport from the Services could move intothe docks before the Easter holidays.    This -would, however,mean cancelling Easter leavej    and, even if there had been no strike, little work would in fact have been done at the docks.   In particular, if the troops were sent in during the holidays, the cold storage plants would not be able to receive any perishable goods which they might unload.   We thereforeconclude that the Services should go in to begin v/ork thefirst thing on Wednesday,  20th April&apos;. Easter leave v/ould makeit impossible for them to do so on the Tuesday.   The Ministerof Defence and the Service Ministers have agreed in the mean-time to make all necessary preparations on the assumptionthat this move will take place.(THIS DOCUMENT .IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)SECRET- C*Pe(49)  88 COPY N0.5j12TH APRIL, 191+9CABINET

5-On behalf of the Committee I ask the Cabinet -(1) To authorise the Emergencies Committee toarrange for Service men and transport to begin work at the Port&apos; of London on the &apos;morning of Wednesday^, 20th April, unlesstfte strike has meantime been settled*(2)    To agree that a Government announcement onthese lines should be made forthwith.6.     Legal Steps.    This strike creates a precedent in thepost war period-   It is official in that it has been calledby the Executive of the National Amalgamated Stevedoresand Lockers, which we are informed is Communist controlled.Since the procedure laid down in the Conditions of employment and National Arbitration Order has not been followed it isillegal.   We were informed that this is the first strikesince the making of the Order which is both official andillegal.   There might be a case for instituting criminal proceedings in respect of breach of the Order, but the Committeedo not consider such a step would be advisable, at any rate atthe present stage.    There may, however, be good grounds for civil proceedings being brought by the National Lock labour board as the employers of the men concerned.   These proceedingswould take the form of seeking an injunction requiring theleaders of the strike to refrain from inciting the men tobreak their contract of service by failing to report themselves as available for work.   We have asked the Attorney-general to examine the possibility of such civil proceedings and toadvise the Cabinet on the matter tomorrows7*     Long-Term Considerations.     The frequent recrudescenceof this&quot; &quot;form of trouble at ttie docks calls, in the Committee^opinion, for a thorough investigation into the underlyingcauses and the devising of means to avoid its recurrence.J.C.E.Home Office, S.W.I.,12th April, 19*1-91
