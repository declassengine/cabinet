(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;secret.P. (56) 4420th February, 1956CABINETWORKMEN^ COMPENSATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national InsuranceAt the suggestion of the Lord Privy Seal, I am circulating a reporton the position now reached on the old cases of workmen&apos;s compensation.2.      The problem is that of the totally disabled man whose injury wasreceived prior to the Industrial Injuries Act and who receives benefit underthe Old Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts,    TLe maximum rates of workmen&apos;compensation have remained where they v/ere fixed in 1943, i. e. 40s.(single), 50s. (married), and 55s. (married with pre-accident child).    Undei-the Industrial Injuries Act the pension in respect of 100 per cent disabilityis 67s. 6d.3.      In view of the dismantling of the old workmen^ compensation system,the only practicable way of providing additional help for the recipients of workmen^ compensation is to supplement it from the Industrial InjuriesFund.     There is strong feeling in the Trade Union movement that the disparity in benefit, which results solely from the date when the mansuffered his injury, is excessive and should be remedied.     They argue that,if the workmenfs compensation system had remained, the rates fixed in1943 would have been increased in line with almost every other form of social service payment.4.      In these circumstances, my predecessor obtained authority from theHome Affairs Committee (H.P, (55) 16th Meeting, Item 10) to negotiate withthe Trades Union Congress (T. U.C.).    He had authority to go as far as ascheme of graduated supplementation which would have cost  800, 000.When I saw the T.U.C. recently,, however, I was able to come to an under-standing with them on the basis of a somewhat more economical schemeproviding a supplement of 17s, 6d. for all the totally incapacitated.    Thisscheme would cost the Industrial Injuries Fund  650, 000 a year.5.      The T.U. C. have also pressed for supplementation in the case ofthe partially incapacitated,    I share my predecessors view that there is little case for this, in view inter alia of the fact that the partiallyincapacitated are able to earn at to-day&apos;s higher wage levels.    While theT.U.C. reserved their position on the partially incapacitated, I was ableto obtain from them an assurance that, subject to what is said below, aBill even though limited to the totally incapacitated and on the lines setout above would go forward with their full goodwill.COPY NO.
6:.    The difficulty is timing.     The T.U.C. set great store by speedyaction,     They feel strongly that the men concerned have had a difficult timein the last few years and that their position ought to be rectified speedily.Indeed, they made it clear that their goodwill for a modest measure suchas that indicated above was contingent on early steps to enact it,    I formed the impression that the T.U, C, representatives were extremely anxious tobe able to show some result for their discussions before the meeting of theT.U.C. in September.7.      It would therefore be an advantage from the point of view of clinchingthe deal if legislation could be introduced this esssion..    Authority has beenobtained to draft, and a Bill is being prepared.    I would not myself give this measure priority as against the Family Allowances Bill.     The case for taking it this session is in substance the desirability of bringing to a conclusion an economical arrangement for dealing with a long-standinggrievance.0.      I warned the T. U. C, when I saw them that I could not guaranteelegislation this session, and I attach as an annex to this paper a letterreceived from Sir Vincent Tewson.J,A,D, -C,Ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W. C. 2.18th February, 1956.ANNEXTrades Union Congress.26th January, 1956.Dear Mr. Boyd-Carpenter,Supplementation of W&quot;orkmen&apos;s Compensation CasesThe General Council have considered the proposals discussed atthe deputation which you received on 17th January.They are strongly of the opinion that action to deal with the to!;alincapacity cases on the lines agreed at the meeting should be taken at theearliest opportunity.     There is, as you know, very strong feeling on thismatter in our Movement, and the General Council have asked me to urge that every effort should be made to ensure the introduction of the necessarlegislation during the present session.
It is understood that the action proposed for total incapacity oasesis without prejudice to the partial and latent cases.     The General Councilnote that while you were unable to hold out prospects of extending legislationyou would be prepared to give consideration to a further memorandum onthis aspect.Yours sincerely,(Signed) VINCENT TEWSONGeneral Secretary.The Rt. Hon. John Doyd-Carpenter, M. P.
