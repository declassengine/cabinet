(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT&apos;,secret,P, (56) 36 COPY NO. J* l13 tli February, 1956CABINETTHE 10s. WIDOWMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance on 0th February the Cabinet invited me &quot;to circulate a memorandum containing a representative selection of public statements made by membersof the Government or their supporters on this matter&quot; (CM. (56) 9thConclusions, Minute 6).2. The story begins with the Coalition Government&apos;s White Paper.The relevant passage is:-&quot;Women already married at start of new scheme tomen insured under existing scheme.    Women in this category who become widows will be eligible for thebenefits of the new scheme   ...   if they have the qualifications for those benefits ...   If, however, theyhave not these qualifications but the contributionconditions / that is, of the old schemey7 are satisfied,they will be eligible for a pension of 10s. a week, thatis, the equivalent of the widowfs pension to which theywould have been entitled under the existing scheme. &quot;This passage-is reproduced in paragraph 56 of the National InsuranceAdvisory Committee&apos;s Reports3. The Campaign Guide circulated by the Conservative andUnionist Central Office to candidates at the General Election, 1955, refers to this matter under the heading ^Matters under Review&quot; on page 218.Apart from a purely historical and factual description of the positionand its inclusion under sub-head .(i) of &quot;Questions under Review&quot;, theonly relevant words are &quot;this question of the 10s. widow&apos;s pension,which is now under review, is bound up with the changes in the provisionfor widowhood brought about by the National Insurance Act, 194-6&quot;.4.        At the party Conference at Bournemouth in October the thenMinister of Pensions said on this subject &quot;this is a complicated subjectbut I am confident that with the help of my Advisory Committee itwill be possible to make revisions in the structure of the scheme forwidows1 pensions which will improve upon the plan adopted in 1946&quot;.50        The General Purposes Committee of the National Union of conservative and Unionist Associations have received during recent months resolutions for an increase in this pension from the ManchesterWomen&apos;s Conference and the Northern Area Women&apos;s Conference andalso from the Newcastle West Executive Council.
6.        Neither the Central Office nor my Department are able to trace any reference at the General Election to this subject by anysenior member of the Government, though Government supporterswho are quoted as having spoken strongly in favour of an increaseinclude Colonel Sir Alan Gornme-Duncan and Mr, JoJ0 Astor.7.        During the passage of the 1954 National Insurance Bill,however, the then Minister of Pensions after speaking of the reference of this matter to fee National Insurance Advisory Committee, concluded by saying that his statement was one &quot;which I trust will be understood to be a sympathetic one&quot;.    During the passage of the same Bill the then Minister of Health referred to this and said &quot;the very sympatheticreply which was given to fee Committee last night about the questionof the 10s. widow should cover this matter (the 20s. industrial injurieswidow) as well&quot;.S.        In the last two years a very considerable number of Govern-ment supporters, one or two of whom have become- Junior Ministers,have pressed th.2 claim of the 10s. widow for an increase by way ofParliamentary Question or speech.     These include Mr, J.N. Browne,Mr. Ridsdale, Mr. Fort, Mr. Kemeth Thompson, Colonel McKibbin,Captain Pi Iking ton,. Mr. Richard Wood, Brigadier Clarke, Mr. Gower, .Commander Marshall, Sir Roland Robinson, Mr. Simon andDame Irene Ward.     There is at present strong support for an increaseamong the members of the Parliamentary Health and Social SecurityCommittee.9. I may add by way of comment that pressure on this subjectseems to have developed very substantially since the General Election.For the information of my colleagues I. would also add that I understanda petition on behalf of these ladies is to be presented to Parliamentthis week by Sir Robert Boothby.J.A.B-C.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,W.C.2.13th February, .19 56.
