COPY NO.   5 .&apos;CABINETTHE FEDERATION OF MALAYANote by the Secretary of State for the colonies as my colleagues know, a Conference with a delegation from theFederation of Malaya to consider the next steps in constitutional advance in malaya starts in London on 18th January.     The delegation consists of fourrepresentatives of the Alliance, led by the Chief Minister Tunku abdul rahman, and four representatives of the Malayan Rulers.    I expect theConference to discuss, among other matters, the composition and termsof reference of a Constitutional Commission, Defence, Internal Security,Financial Assistance, and the &quot;Malayanisation&quot; of the Public Service.The memorandum, annexed, which sets out the lines along which I think the Conference should be guided, contains my proposals on these matters.secret.P. (56) 1214th January, 19562. The Colonial Policy Committee, in giving their general approval to these proposals at their meeting on 12th January, considered that it wouldbe necessary to go somewhat further than I had proposed to meet the Malayandelegation on the question of internal security, and at the sarre time to seekstronger guarantees in respect of external defence (C,A.(56) 2nd Meeting,Item 2).Internal Security3. This is a basic issue, as it is essential that ultimate controlover internal security should remain in our hands up to the date on whichinternal self-government comes into effect and that even after that date weshould retain operational control so long as Commonwealth forces areemployed on internal security.    Although I had hoped that the chief minister could be persuaded to be content with the transfer at the present stage of the administrative control of the police, it is probable that he willpress for the immediate transfer of the Federation local military forces aswell as the police and prisons.    He is now publicly committed to returning to Malaya with an agreement which will at least appear to give himresponsibility for internal security, and there are strong arguments forgoing as far as possible to meet him.    As the control over the UnitedKingdom and Commonwealth units would still remain in our hands, theColonial Policy Committee endorsed my view that it would be wise to meet this request, if it is pressed, by agreeing to transfer now the administrative,but not the operational, control of the local defence forces and the police.The High Commissioner and,, I understand, the Chiefs of Staff support thisproposal which would ensure that residual control over internal security,including security intelligence,  remained in our hands during the interim period.
23 ftColonial Office, S.W.1.13th January, 1956.-2-4, I have proposed in my memorandum (paragraph 8) that if wesucceed in limiting the next stage of constitutional advance to a period ofinternal self-government, with the grant of full self-government to becontemplated at the end of that period, of about two years, the discussionof external defence at this stage could be confined to reaching an agreement in principle that a formal agreement should be negotiated later to providefor our right to retain in the Federation the forces which we consider necessary for its defence and to meet our international obligations and forthe supporting facilities and arrangements which we should require.    Mycolleagues in the Colonial Policy Committee felt that we might be in a stronger position at this point, than at the moment of granting full self-government, to secure the guarantees we needed.    It was decided that Ishould attempt to reach now, in negotiating an advance towards internal self-government, agreement on a broad formula which would specify andguarantee the rights we needed, including those required to carry out our obligations under ANZAM and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation.5. Subject to these modifications I seek the approval of theCabinet for the general lines of the proposals in my memorandum.    I alsoask that I shall be free to diverge from them if necessary on all but major issues;  on those I will reserve my position for further consultation with my colleagues, but without such discretion it will be difficult for me to handle the Conference effectively,  especially as the specific questions whichwill be considered are, for the reason given in paragraph 2 of the paper,still in various degrees undefined, g, *A. L-B.
SECRETCONFERENCE ON CONSTITUTIONAL ADVANCE IN THEFEDERATION OF MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesBackgroundThis Conference is due to open on Wednesday, 18th January, and is expectedto last for some two to three weeks. Three groups will participate first, a delegation from the Federation composed of four leading members of the Alliance,headed by the Chief Minister, and four representatives of Their Highnesses the rulers, second, the High Commissioner and a number of his senior advisers and,third, myself and my advisers, who will as necessary include representatives ofother interested Departments.2. I originally agreed with the Alliance and the Rulers that the main subjects on the agenda should be:  1. The terms of reference, composition and timing of a commission to review the constitution.2. Defence.3. Internal security.4. Finance.5. The future of the public service.It later became clear that we should have to deal with a number of other subjects of lesser importance, with which I need not now trouble my colleagues. As aresult of preoccupation with other more immediate problems it has not beenpossible for the Alliance Ministers to give as much time as they would have liked to preparations for the Conference; nor have they been able to have detailed discussions with the Rulers&apos; representatives. I therefore do not yet know definitelyhow far the two sides of the delegation will come to the Conference with an identity of view, or what is to be asked of us. It appears, however, from the latest reportto reach me that the Chief Minister proposes to seek the immediate grant of:  (i) Control of internal security.(ii) Control of finance.(iii) Malayanisation of the public service.He is said to regard these as amounting to self-government. Iunderstand that by &quot; control of finance &quot; he means only the appoint-ment of an elected Minister of Finance in place of the presentex offlcio Financial Secretary. I see no difficulty about this. I shalldeal later with the questions of internal security and Malayanisation.(iv) The appointment of a constitutional commission instructed to prepare for the introduction of what he calls &quot; full independence&quot; by the31st August, 1957, if possible.By this he is reported to mean full control of external affairs and defence, &quot; thoughtreaty arrangements on these could be made with Britain.&quot;3. Certain matters will have to be determined during the course of theConference but its aim will not be to reach detailed agreements on all the main items; it will rather be to agree in broad terms what should be done, the detailsbeing left to be worked out later where necessary. Nor will the conclusions andrecommendations of the Conference immediately bind Her Majesty&apos;s Government,the Federation Government or the Rulers: before they become binding they willbe referred back to all three parties for study and approval. This is due toinsistence by the Rulers that their representatives at the Conference should in no sense be plenipotentiaries and that the Rulers would hold themselves free toconsider the recommendations of the Conference without prior commitment toaccept them. In view of this, although the delegation will to a large extent regardHer Majesty&apos;s Government as committed to anything that may be provisionallyagreed at the Conference, I propose to make it clear that we must retain the samefreedom as the other parties to study the recommendations before finally approvingthem.49429B
General Approach4. We must be prepared to go a very long way with the delegation on thefundamental question of political advance, and to do so with a readiness fromwhich we may reasonably hope to derive all the advantages that can flow fromestablishing an atmosphere of goodwill and understanding early in the Conference.If we do not approach this major issue boldly we will in the end be driven backupon our final positions in an atmosphere which will do no good to our future relations with the territory. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the strength of feeling in the Federation about self-government; and the Alliance could hardly bein a stronger position to pursue it. It was the main plank in their election campaign,and as a result they were swept into power with victory in 51 of the52 constituencies for the Legislative Council. There is, of course, still a wide gulfbetween the Malay and Chinese races, and no one could to-day say with any confidence how or when it will be bridged. This may well give rise to graveproblems when the territory becomes self-governing, but meanwhile we must accept the fact that the two races are completely united in the demand for self-government and that we no longer have anything to gain by arguing that relations between them must be more firmly and harmoniously established beforeself-government can be granted. Another, more immediate, problem is thesettlement of the considerable differences of outlook between the Rulers and thepoliticians. I propose not to let myself be made a party to any disputes which mayemerge between them during the Conference, and to insist that relations betweenthe Rulers and the political leaders in the Federation are essentially matters whichthey must settle among themselves.5. But the decisive consideration is that the Alliance can claim that in seeking self-government they demonstrably enjoy the enthusiastic support of practically the whole country. (Apart from the Sultan of Johore, few, if any, ofthose who may believe otherwise would dare to say so.) It would also be difficultto offer any conclusive refutation of the argument which the Alliance would almost certainly use, should it seem necessary, that, probably with some continuing help from us in a number of ways, the Federation is as well equipped for self-government as the wholly independent Asian countries by which it is surrounded. Few ofthem are face to face with anything like the same problem of Communist violence and subversion, but I see no effective counter to the answering argument that a determined Malayan Government with full responsibility for their own internal affairs could deal more successfully with the Communists than a &quot; Colonial&quot;regime running a country anxious to be rid of it. In this connection it is significantto recall that our recent statement that we no longer regarded the continuation ofthe shooting war at its present sort of level as an obstacle on the road toself-government had an excellent effect upon the Alliance Ministers and publicopinion generally and was a real blow to the Communist terrorists. The indications are that, if we accept the Alliance view on this, we shall be able to securesatisfactory agreements on defence and the other issues of particular concern tous. If, on the other hand, we do not go far enough with them on the question ofself-government, we shall in all probability not only fail to secure such agreementsbut also find ourselves faced with a refusal to co-operate in the administration ofthe Government and a serious deterioration in internal security. We know thatthe Chief Minister has in his possession signed letters of resignation from all members of his party who are also members of all councils from the LegislativeCouncil downwards. Without them, none of the councils could in practice survive.These letters have only to be dated and submitted to produce a situation in whichthe High Commissioner would be forced to assume direct administration of the affairs of the territory. Moreover, the sympathies of nearly all local members ofthe public service and police, the great majority of whom are Malays, would lie with the Chief Minister and his colleagues. Faced with a hostile public, at leastunco-operative and perhaps quickly turning to active opposition, we should find ourselves benefitting only the Communists; and sooner rather than later we shouldhave to concede in the most unhappy circumstances what we could earlier havegranted with an air of generosity, the support of world opinion and the promise ofloyal co-operation. The tide is still flowing in our direction, and we can still rideit; but the ebb is close at hand and if we do not make this our moment of decisionwe shall have lost the power to decide. Not far off the French have shown us what can happen if such a tide is missed.
Constitutional Commission6. In the last analysis, if the delegation are adamant in demanding that the.constitutional commission should prepare a scheme for full self-government, weshall at least have to consider whether we can agree. On the other hand, I hope to obtain agreement to the more modest proposal that the terms of reference ofthe commission should be so drawn as to set it the task of preparing a scheme only for internal self-government, excluding defence and foreign affairs. Nothing lessthan this will serve. The subjects with which the commission will have to deal will include the structure of the legislature; the question whether or not there shouldbe an Upper House; citizenship; the relation between the Federal Government andthe State Governments; and the position of the Rulers. The commission will thus be: faced with a heavy task and I would hope to set it to work as soon as possiblesince it would be of some tactical value to agree with the delegation that thecommission should aim at completing its work, if possible, in time for its recommendations to be agreed and put into effect by 31st August, 1957, as proposedby the Chief Minister. Until recently it seemed likely that the demand would befor a commission mainly, if not wholly, composed of persons from outside theFederation, and that we should be asked to find most of them from other commonwealth countries and not from the United Kingdom alone. In that case would seek agreement upon a fairly small body with a chairman and at least one other member from the United Kingdom. According to my most recent information, however, the delegation are likely to propose a commission composedentirely of Malayans except for a chairman from outside the country. I see no need to make an issue of this question, but I shall insist that, in view ofthe responsibilities of Her Majesty&apos;s. Government, the chairman must be someoneacceptable to us, and I shall seek to have it agreed that I should myself look for asuitable person.7. It is plain from past experience and from the very nature of things alikethat, even if I succeed in obtaining agreement to an interim period during whichself-government is limited to internal affairs, that cannot last very long. It would,however, be invaluable in preparing for an orderly handover, and particularly in allowing local Ministers an opportunity gradually to learn how the machinery ofinternal security ought to work and what is its proper and essential relation toexternal defence. I shall deal with this aspect of the matter more fully later. Butif we recognise the inevitability of the advance to full self-government before very long, it would be foolish not to extract from that such advantage as we can. i therefore further propose to agree that the constitution should again be reviewed at the end of two years from the introduction of internal self-government in orderthat, in the light of its operation during that time, the grant of full self-governmentshould be contemplated.Defence8. On this programme responsibility for external defence would remain withthe High Commissioner right through to the beginning of full self-government.Among other advantages this would allow time for the careful preparation of a defence agreement designed to have effect from the date of full self-government.It is already in practice essential that the High Commissioner should consult his executive Council on any defence questions which directly involve the federation government, and this arrangement would necessarily continue. I also propose,however, that, as in the Gold Coast, the High Commissioner should have a smalladvisory committee of Ministers whom he could at his discretion keep more closely in touch with problems of defence, although he would not be bound to accept their advice. This should provide for a valuable process of education. It had earlierbeen thought that a defence agreement would be a major matter for the conference to consider, certainly in broad terms and possibly even in some detail; and discussions on the subject have been going on between the interested departments in London, and also in Malaya. If, however, my present plan succeeds, discussionof defence need presumably go no further than an attempt to reach agreement inprinciple that there should in due course be a formal agreement providing for our right to maintain the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in the Federation, for thefacilities which that will; require and for arrangements ensuring that our forces willbe able to function effectively in the event of war. We should also make it clearthat these arrangements must, allow for the participation, both in force and in planning, of Australia and New Zealand. I hope that the Federation Government49429 b 2
will ultimately join the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation, It is too early tomove in that direction at present, but the period of internal self-government will,I trust, help to produce that result.Internal Security9. Internal security poses a problem of crucial importance and great difficulty.Hitherto we have always taken the line that until the stage of full self-governmentwas reached the Governor of any dependent territory must retain ultimate responsibility for internal security, and in particular for control of the police. Inthe Gold Coast even to-day, for instance, the Governor still controls internal security, advised by a committee of the Cabinet but not bound to accept (ornecessarily even to seek) their advice. Until quite recently the Chief Minister ofthe Federation intended to ask for immediate control over the military forces aswell as over the police, but my latest information is that a study of the problem ofmaking the military forces self-contained and independent of Imperial units mayhave convinced him that this is impracticable, and I am also told that his colleagueshope to persuade him to be content with the transfer of responsibility for thepolice.10. The High Commissioner, the Director of Operations, the commissioner of Police and the Chief Secretary (who is the Minister at present responsible for internal security) all take the view that this request should be granted. their view is based mainly upon two arguments first, that the Alliance are so set uponobtaining this concession that refusal on our part might result in the breakdown ofthe whole Conference; and, second, that internal security will in any case be bettersafeguarded if controlled by co-operative local Ministers than if we retain nominalcontrol in the face of constant opposition from Ministers and, as a result, probably also of growing unreliability among the great mass of the locally-recruited membersof the internal security forces themselves. Nor can we ignore the fact that the delegation are likely to be fortified in their attitude by Chin Peng&apos;s statement inthe recent discussion of the amnesty offer that the Communist terrorists would beprepared to lay down their arms and leave the jungle when control of internal security had passed to an elected Government in the Federation.11. While I agree that it would be impolitic to resist in principle the idea ofthe early transfer of responsibility for internal security, I hope that practicalarguments can be developed in the forthcoming talks with a view to avoiding anychange during the period before the introduction of internal self-government. Themain point would be the difficulty of making any such change without affectingthe intelligence and operational machine during the immediate future, when theshooting war must be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.12. If, however, despite this, it appears necessary to make some gesture in response to the Chief Minister^ demand for the immediate transfer of the controlof internal security, I would propose to go no further than to agree that the Ministerfor Home Affairs (a portfolio at present held by the Chief Minister) should takeover responsibility for prisons, detention camps and the civil defence organisation,and for the administration but not the operational control of the police.&quot; Operational control &quot; would be regarded as covering the operations of the special branch and the Director of Intelligence^ organisation. Responsibility for theFederation military forces and the volunteer units would remain with the Secretaryfor Defence. Whether or not any such concession has to be made, I think it important to obtain a clear understanding that at all stages, including that of full self-government, the police should retain the independence and freedom from political influence in the ordinary conduct of their civil duties which they at presentenjoy and which in the United Kingdom is regarded as a cardinal principle. Thiswould mean, for example, that the Commissioner of Police would retain sole responsibility for police investigations and prosecutions, where necessary dealingdirect with the Law Officers on such matters. I further hope that it will be possibleto agree upon the early establishment of a police service commission which would at first advise the High Commissioner on such matters as appointments, promotionsto gazetted rank and discipline, and would, when internal self-government, and later full self-government, came, continue in existence as a independent body.13. The core of the whole problem is, however, what we agree to do aboutinternal security when internal self-government is introduced. My own view isthat we should at once agree that, subject to an important understanding relating
W 5.to the essential interests of the Federation itself and to our responsibilities forits protection, the introduction of internal self-government should carry with itthe transfer of control of internal security. The understanding would be that,because of the enduring mutual interest of the Federation Government and her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in the defence of the territory,and because of the impossibility of dissociating that defence from internal security,both Governments should recognise their common interest and concern in themachinery for security intelligence and counter-subversion. This machinery is atpresent on the whole soundly constructed and operationally efficient: it is essentialto keep it so since otherwise the dangers of internal subversion will gravely and rapidly increase and adequate arrangements for the defence of the territory cannotbe sustained. Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ continuing responsibility for defencetherefore requires that the product of the work of the intelligence security machine and of the police Special Branch must continue to be equally available to theHigh Commissioner as well as to local Ministers; and Ministers for their part must recognise Her Majesty&apos;s Governments special interest in the maintenance of theefficiency of that machine after it is handed over to their responsibility. Moreover,so long as the shooting war continues, because of our enormous contribution tosustaining it, both in troops and in other ways, the High Commissioner must retainresponsibility for the conduct of operations. During the period of internal self-government, in addition to maintaining the intelligence security machine at full efficiency, our objects should be to make local Ministers thoroughly conversantwith its nature, functions and operation and to go ahead as fast as possible with thetraining of Malayans in its work, in order that when the time for full self-government arrives the machine can continue to do its job without loss of efficiency.For this it will be particularly important to ensure that every encouragement isgiven to British officers to remain at their posts, certainly during internal self-government and, it is to be hoped, even thereafter. Without this the wholeplan is likely to be jeopardised.14. There remains the question of Singapore, where the problem of internal security is still more serious and difficult. It is bound to arise in my discussions with the delegation from the Colony which is due to come to London in April;and it would have been satisfactory if I felt that I could approach it on the same lines as I have proposed for the Federation. Unfortunately, however, as I seethings at present, any demand that the control of internal security should at anearly date be handed over to local Ministers in Singapore will have to be resisted.I believe that a reasonable arrangement could be arrived at with Marshall andhis colleagues, but we have to recognise that he is a phenomenon of limited andprobably brief duration, and that there is in sight no other potential Governmentwhich we could safely entrust with this responsibility. Even more than in theFederation our whole defensive position in Singapore depends upon it. Whilefacing this, I do not think that we can let it affect our attitude towards theFederation. If we turned the Federation down because of Singapore we should run into grave trouble with the former without saving ourselves similar trouble with the latter; whereas, if we can secure a contented Government in theFederation we shall be in a stronger position should it be necessary to take adifferent and tougher line in Singapore.Finance15. It is not possible to consider the question of finance in any great detailsince the Government of the Federation have not yet completed a review of their financial resources and of the demands to be made upon them during the next five years. There have been suggestions, however, that the delegation may haveambitious projects in mind for the future and that the demands which it maypresent for assistance may be substantial. For the present, however, it shouldbe assumed, in the absence of any clear evidence to the contrary, that the delegationwill accept the principle that full self-government carries with it the obligation of financial self-sufficiency and that the Federation should then cease to look to the United Kingdom for general financial assistance, except in so far as that assistance may be made available by loans for development through the london market. Even when the Emergency comes to an end Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill continue to have heavy financial commitments in the Federation as a resultof their continuing responsibility for its external defence.   Apart from this, Her
Majesty&apos;s Government have at&quot; present certain further financial commitments,actual or potential; in respect of the Federation.  These are:  (i) A promise; to consider financial assistance if the Emergency and the programmes for rubber replanting and expanded educational servicesinvolve the Federation in agreed expenditure which cannot be metafter the maximum possible use has been made of local resources.(ii) A new grant of  4 million from Colonial Development and Welfarefunds for use in the period ending the 31st March, 1960.(iii) A grant of up to  7-2 million for use up to 1962 towards the capital cost of the expansion of the local armed forces.(iv) A promise to consider loan assistance should the Federation be unableto make local arrangements to finance its contribution to the BufferStock under the International Tin Agreement.16. No change need be caused to these arrangements by a degree of constitutional advance which falls short of full self-government, but it is necessaryto consider how they might be modified when the Federation becomes fully self-governing. The commitments which Her Maiesty&apos;s Government have assumedunder paragraph 15 (i) would lapse; the Federation did not require a grant towardsthe cost of the Emergency in 1955, none will be needed this year and there is no present reason to expect that any will be needed in 1957. There remain the types of assistance listed under paragraph 15 (ii), (iii) and (iv). I believe that the UnitedKingdom interest in preserving a friendly Malaya will be best served if we avoid any suspicion of exacting a price for the grant of full self-government bywithdrawing the specific monies already promised.  I therefore propose (a) that arrangements should be made to enable the Federation, should itattain to full self-government before the 31st March, I960, to continueto receive assistance up to the limit in paragraph 15 (ii);(b) that the Federation should continue up to 1962 to be able to count uponfinancial asistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government as already promisedfor the capital cost of the expansion of her armed forces, and that, ifnecessary, this assistance should be increased beyond the figure of 7-2 million quoted in paragraph 15 (iii), to cover the capital cost, asmay be agreed, in connection with any further expansion of those forces;and,(c) that the arrangements in paragraph 15 (iv) should remain in force.The Future of the Public Service17. &quot; Malayanisation,&quot; or the staffing of the Public Service by local officers,has been the accepted policy of the Federation Government for a number of years.The delegation is certain to press for complete Malayanisation as quickly aspossible, and political pressure will undoubtedly tend in the direction of removingoverseas officers more rapidly than the country&apos;s true interests will allow. Whileagreeing that all reasonable steps should be taken to accelerate Malayanisation,I propose to remind the delegation of the grave damage which their administration will suffer if overseas officers leave before there are adequately qualified local officers to replace them. The aim should be, not to replace overseas officers bylocal officers for the sake of doing so, but to build up a loyal and efficient service in which, while Malayanisation proceeds, both local and overseas officers can feelassured that their conditions of service will continue to be governed by traditionalservice principles and that there will be no discrimination on racial or political grounds. A public statement to this effect by Federation Ministers on the linesof statements made by the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast and by Nigerianpolitical leaders would go far to remove uncertainties and to reassure staff. Ishall endeavour to obtain the agreement of the delegation that such a statement should be made.18. A loyal and efficient service can be secured only by the establishment ofan independent Pubic Service Commission entirely free from political influenceThere is as yet no Public Service Commission in the Federation and I propose to urge the delegation to see that one is set up forthwith and to ensure that it is atruly independent body commanding the respect of both the Government and thePublic Service.
19. I must also make it my task to safeguard the interests of those overseasofficers for whom 1 am responsible and to secure agreement to a fair scheme ofcompensation for those whose terms and conditions of service and career prospects are affected by constitutional changes or by Malayanisation. Details of such ascheme will have to be worked out in consultation with the Government and theStaff Associations concerned but I propose to press for a scheme in two stageson lines similar to those followed in the Gold Coast. So long as I am able toexercise, through the High Commissioner, ultimate control in essentials over theterms and conditions of service of those officers for whom I am responsible, thescheme would permit all such officers to retire on earned pension plus acompensatory addition. When by reason of constitutional or other changes, terms and conditions of service are no longer under my control, the scheme would providefor officers to be offered lump-sum compensation. Those officers who stayed onwould retain indefinitely the right to leave at any time with due compensation.They would have to become members of the local Service and forgo my protection,but they would remain members of Her Majesty&apos;s Oversea Civil Service (whereapplicable) and continue to be eligible for transfer and promotion to other territories.20. I assume that the Conference will result in constitutional changesrequiring the immediate introduction of the first of these two schemes, but I also propose that it should be clearly and publicly established that a full lump-sumcompensation scheme will be worked out at once and introduced at the rightmoment.A.
