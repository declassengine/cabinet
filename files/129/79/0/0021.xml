FUEL AND POWER PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power would like to inform the Cabinet of the provisional views I have formed, after reviewing short and long-term fuel and power prospects,about the lines of future action.PROSPECTSThe rest of this winter2.      We started 1956 with coal stocks (20.0 million tons) which in totalwere rather better than those we have had in recent years (1955 -16.0 millions;  1954 - 19. 5 millions).     There are several reasons for this.In 1955 we imported 11-i million tons of coal, i. e. nearly four times as muchas in 1954.     The good weather helped to hold down consumption and enabledadditional coal to be produced from the opencast sites.    Production fromthe deep mines, on the other hand, was badly down, being 3-1 million tonsless than in the previous year (1955 - 210 millions;   1954 - 213^ millions).While this decline reflects the neglect of investment in past years, thesituation was aggravated by falling manpower and, in particular, by the yorkshire strike and a spate of smaller unofficial stoppages.3.      Although our total coal stocks are satisfactory, stocks of housecoal are less good.     They are about the same as a year ago, and somewhat less than in the preceding year.    We need not expect real trouble, but the merchants are faced with a labour shortage and our main concern must beto see that the distributive machine functions smoothly, particularly duringcold spells.Rest of 19564.      On the best estimates I can make, total coal production in 1956 shouldbe much the same as in 1955, a small decrease in deep mined production dueto declining manpower being offset by a small increase in opencastproduction.    If, however, 1956 suffered from the same labour troubles as1955 total coal production would inevitably be much lower.    Allowing for a smaller stockbuild, demand may not be much more than in 1955 if the oilconversion programme continues to go according to plan.    Accordingly,the cut of 5 million tons in exports already decided on means that therecan be a corresponding reduction in imports to 6^- million tons.    TheNational Coal Board, who will be engaged during the year in delicatenegotiations with the miners1 union, attach importance - I think rightly -to safeguarding their bargaining position through an adequate &quot;cushion&quot;of coal stocks.    I recognise, however, that the state of the gold and dollar reserves limits the extent to which such a &quot;cushion&quot; can be secured bymeans of imports.-1-o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT-__x_____________________*._______-____-______-__._________________..__-__-___iSECRET-***i t    \C.P.(56) 21 COPY NO, ^ &apos;26th January, 1956CABINET
The next five years.      It is thought that the inland demand for coal in I960 will be about2Z0 million tons a year.     There are two assumptions underlying this estimate:  (i) that industrial production generally will go on increasing atthe rate required to achieve a doubling of the standard of living in a genera-tion;   (ii) that between 1954 and I960 the increase in annual consumption of black oils will be the equivalent of 25 million tons of coal - the target,announced by my predecessor.    This target is formidable and involvestrebling the total consumption of black oils in six years.    In 1955 we kept up to schedule but there is still a long way to go.6.      In addition to the inland demand for coal there is the present exportcommitment of about 6 million tons a year, most of which I must assume tobe inescapable in the future.    Indeed, it is highly decirable, in order to ease our trade and balance of payments position, that not only shouldimports cease but our exports should, if possible, be increased to about10 million tons a year.    With this in mind I think we should assume a totalcoal requirement in 1950 of some 230 million tons.7.      The Boards provisional estimate is that by I960 their deep-minedoutput might reach 220 million tons (compared with 210 in 1955).    I thinkit prudent somewhat to discount this estimate, and there are manyuncertainties which may seriously upset even the most cautious calculation.For example, about 11 million tons of coal a yea.r might be lost if the minersgave up the voluntary working of a Saturday shift and reverted to the five-day week to which they are entitled.    Further, there is the threat of thenew miners&apos; charter in which the miners are claiming, among other things,more holidays and shorter working hours.    In so far as this is granted, itwill be granted only in stages;   but the concession ultimately of all thepoints might cost 40 million tons of coal a year.    Finally, some loss ofproduction, not easily assessable, must ensue from the application of thenew Mines and Quarries Act.0.      In view of the uncertainties attending deep-mined output, it isimportant that we should maintain opencast production, now running at11 million tons.    It is, however, becoming increasingly difficult to find sites for opencast working, and opencast production between now and I960 seems likely to fall below the present level if the existing bans on the working off first class agricultural land are maintained.The long-term9.      Estimates of the likely level of demand for all fuel up to 1970 are necessarily speculative.    On the assumptions that nuclear power makes the contribution envisaged in the &quot;White Paper, that the rate of expansion of oilconsumption slackens off after I960, and that an annual export commitment(with no imports) of something like 10 million tons should be aimed at,requirements between I960 and 1970 might be as follows:-I960 1965 1970(m. tons of coal equivalent)CoalOilNuclear energyHydro-electricity and23067123 537624010616miscellaneous sources223Total300330365
10.     Our aim must of course be to meet these coal requirements in fullfrom domestic production.    For the reasons indicated above (in para-graphs 7 and 8) I am very doubtful whether this aim can be achieved inI960 or even in 1965, but I think we can feel more confident about 1970.ACTION11.     In the intermediate term the conversion to oil and in the longer term the introduction of nuclear energy promise some relief from thenationrs present dependence on coal.    While every effort must be made to expedite and expand this relief, it cannot do much more, as far as we cannow foretell, than meet the greater part of the increase in the nation&apos;s fuelrequirements.    A rising output of coal will still therefore be required.Further, the threat of political disturbance to our oil supplies makes it allthe more imperative to continue to exploit our coal resources to the full.Nuclear power12.     Some acceleration of the White Paper programme is already plannedProvided the designs are good enough, the first batch of power stations(which should start to be built in 1957 and be working by 1960/61) is to consist not of two but of three stations, the third probably being sited inScotland.    I cannot dispute the view that there is no immediate scope forfurther expansion.    But I think it of the highest importance to ensure,first that these early stations are as efficient as they can be made (evenif this means finding some enriched material to supplement the naturaluranium which they are present planned to use), and secondly that theWhite Paper programme for the early 1960&apos;s is expanded if technicallypossible, so that by 1965 the coal saving achieved is increased to at leastl\ million tons (compared with the 5 to 6 millions suggested in the white paper) and a much bigger expansion thereafter is made possible.Oil conversion and fuel efficiency13.    I am looking into the question whether the conversion to oil can bespeeded up.    My preliminary conclusion is that little acceleration ispossible.    Even if a further increase in the price of coal relative to thatof oil were to increase the demand for oil, the difficulties on the supplyside - e.g. in providing the necessary equipment, transport and storage facilities - would remain considerable.    I am also considering what canbe done to sustain and indeed intensify the drive for increased efficiency in the utilisation of fuel.Mining Manpower14.    The most immediate problem before the coal industry is that of manpower.    Even with some abatement of inflationary pressure, the competing pull of other industries (and, in particular, the metal-using industries) is likely to make this an enduring difficulty in such divisions,as the West Midlands.    Any suggestion for dealing with the problem byvarying wages according to district would encounter strong hostility fromthe miners&apos; union, though I propose to examine with the Board the ;possibility of achieving some improvement by way of a new system of   !allowances.    For the present the best hope of overcoming the shortage -of manpower would seem to lie in the recruitment of men in areas wheremen are still easily come by, e. g. Scotland, Northumberland and Durham,and in their movement to areas of shortage, e. g. West Midlands and      :South Yorkshire, through such inducements as housing and transfer     &apos;allowances.    If the miners could be induced to change their minds about
the importation of foreign labour the problem would of course be eased.Wages and incentives15.    The miners have put forward a new wages claim as well as aminers1 charter containing drastic proposals for shorter working hours and more holidays.    In view of the very strong bargaining position heldby the miners some concession is inevitable.    I am discussing with theBoard the possibility of some kind of &quot;treaty&quot; with the union under whichconcessions on the miners&apos; charter would be made only in return foradvances in production.    Such an arrangement will, however, needmuch preparation and will take time to work out.Investment16.    Over and above the attempt to secure more men and improve their effort, the main hope for increased coal production must lie in investment.    There are three reasons why investment is necessary,First, digging has to be extended to new seams to replace those beingexhausted, the new seams being less accessible than the old, so that capital expenditure on replacement account alone must of necessity be ona rising scale.     Secondly, there must be some expansion in productivecapacity beyond that required for replacement if a rising output is to beachieved.     Thirdly, there must be increased mechanisation, particularlyin loading, this being the only effective answer to the problem ofdeclining manpower.17.    Although the Board have recently managed to go ahead fasterwith their reconstruction schemes, their investment programme has fallen far behind that of other industries.    Investment in collieries sincethe war amounts to under  400 millions.     This compares with some 600 millions invested in the same period in the steel industry and with over  1, 000 millions in the electricity supply industry, while even thecurrent rate of investment per ton of output in the British coal industryis half that in the French coal industry.     There is much leeway there -fore to be made up.     The Government will have to provide the loan finance and it will be necessary to introduce a new Borrowing Powers Bill in the spring.    I recognise, of course, the desirability in present circumstancesof curtailing investment by the public authorities in general.    I wouldplead strongly, however, for the exemption from this curtailment of investment in the production of coal.    A curtailment in the case of coal would have the effect only of aggravating the existing lack of balance between investment in coal and investment in other industries.    And sucha lack of balance, while subordinate to the general problem of inflation,   .is nevertheless in itself an important source of our economic difficulties.The National Coal Board10.    The success of measures to increase output and productivitydepends on an alert and strong management at the top.    From what Ihave hitherto seen I am satisfied that this has not been forthcoming.At the same time to effect any change in top management is a matter ofconsiderable delicacy.    The announcement now that Mr. James Bowmanwill become Chairman of the Board in succession to Sir Hubert Houldswcrthnext July, and that Mr. J. Latham will become Deputy Chairman in succession to Mr. Bowman has been designed to stiffen the top manage-ment without provoking an unhappy reaction.    The appointment at thebeginning of the year of four good part-time members should also help.
The de-control of house coal19.    House coal is the only commodity still subject to some form of rationing and I appreciate that it will be an object of Government policy to get rid of this control as soon as possible.     The present supply and demand position, however, is hardly propitious and I am afraid we shallhave to move cautiously and by gradual stages.Opencast20,    I am loath to bring before my colleagues the vexed question ofopencast.     But it is clear that for some years to come the coal problem will remain serious and I would like my colleagues&apos; support for the continuation of opencast mining at the present level at least.A.J.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S,W. 1,25th January, 1956.
