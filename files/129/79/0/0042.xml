SECRETQiP; (56), 42COPY NO.   w50th February, 1956CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME,. 1955/56Memorandum by the Lord Privy&apos;- seal the purpose of this memorandum is to invite the Cabinet to settle the remainder of the legislative programme for the current session.2.      Pressure on Parliamentary time is exceedingly heavy.   ConsequentlyI have reluctantly had to ask several Ministers to agree to drop Bills whichhad a provisional plaee in the programme.    It has not proved necessary.,for one reason or another, to proceed with other Bills.     The effect of thisis that the following Bills will not now be introduced this sessions-Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions)Colonial Development CorporationColonial ImmigrantsGeneva ConventionsEli re Pur chaseImperial InstituteImports (Special Duties)Inventions and Designs (Defence)Local Government Re-organisationOversea Civil Service Re-organisationPublic Health (Scotland)Representation of the PeopleSlaughterhousesTown Development (Scotland)3.      In spite of these extensive cuts in the programme, there remains an estimated deficit of from four to five weeks of Parliamentary time between now and the beginning of the summer recess.    In order therefore tocomplete the reduced legislative programme for this session it will benecessary both to shorten the summer recess somewhat and to defer theopening of the new session until about 20th November.    Moreover, these calculations allow no margin for unforeseen contingencies, although theydo contain an allowance of time for legislation to deal with Ministers&apos;salaries and the case of the Ulster Members,    We might also be compelledby circumstances to proceed with Bills on, e.g0, the British CaribbeanFederation, or Malta.4.      Nevertheless, there remain eight Bills which need some furtherconsideration.    Particulars of these are set out in the Annex.     the calculations in the preceding paragraph take no account of these Billsand. if any of them were to be added to the programme the deficit ofParliamentary time would be proportionately increased.    It would clearly be difficult - unless for emergency reasons a new Bill had to be fitted in -
to suspend proceedings on any of the Bills now before Parliament in order tcmake room, for one or more of the eight Bills.    I accordingly invite theCabinet to decide whether, notwithstanding these various considerations, a place must somehow be found in the legislative programme for any of the bills described in the Annex.R.A0B0Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S..W.1.20th February, 1956.ANNEXBijj- to abolish Capital PunishmentIn view of the outcome of the debate on 16th February, the questionof introducing legislation in the current session will now need to be urgentlyconsidered.( Family Allowances(( Workmen3s CompensationThe case for introducing these Bills is set out by the Minister ofPensions in CP. (56) 3 5 and 44.Shops (Closing Hours)This Bill, which contains about sixty-eight clauses based on reccomendatons in the Gowers Committee&apos;s report, has been substantiallydrafted.    The Prime Minister told the Trades Union Congress in July lastthat the Government hoped to be able to introduce it in this session.WaterThe purpose of this Bill is to provide permanent powers to replace those contained in two Defence Regulations, without conferring any newpowers,,     The case for retaining the Bill in the programme is that, without it, the Government will be able to take little credit, in the course of nextautumn&apos;s debates on the renewal of emergency legislation, for progressin reducing reliance on the surviving war-time powers.     The HomeSecretary said in the House of Commons on 14th November last that it was hoped that the Bill could be introduced this session.
Public Works Loans DillOn present trends it appears that the powers of the Public works loans Board to lend under the existing Act are likely to be exhausted sometime between the middle of July and the end of August.    In this event,legislation may be unavoidable,,Crown Lands BillThis would be a two-clause Bill dealing with the constitution of theCommissioners of Crown Lands by setting up a Board of Trustees.Department of Scientific and Industrial Research bill the purpose of this Bill would be to provide statutory authority forthe Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.    An undertakinghas been given to the Public Accounts Committee that the Bill will beintroduced in this session.    This pledge would be honoured by introducing the Bill, even though it should prove impossible to find time for all itsParliamentary stages.
