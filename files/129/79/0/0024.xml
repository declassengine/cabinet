secret.P. (56) 24 COPY NO. j  2Gth January, 1956CABINETPROVISION OF EQUIPMENT AT CONCESSION prices to CERTAIN COMMONWEALTH countries memorandum by the Secretary of State forComrnonwealfo. relations have read the memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CeP.(56) 23) about arms for India and Pakistan.2. The following items are involved:-(i)    the provision of Canberras for India;(ii)    the provision of certain ships andBofors guns for Pakistan,3. I do not for a moment contest the general case which theChancellor makes on financial grounds in our present economic difficulties against the proposals which it discusses though my colleagues will see that none of them involves the expenditure of new money but merely the foregoing of hypothetical receipts. However the Indian dealif we bring it off, involves a substantial and valuable export and the ships for Pakistan would be refitted through American aid and we should gain by considerable expenditure in the United Kingdom.4. As regards (i) above - Canberras - the Prime Minister hasLaken the closest personal interest in meeting India over the Canberras,and I agree with him that the political considerations involved are of outstanding importance.5. As regards (ii) - ships and guns for Pakistan, both the PrimeMinister and I have had the strongest representations during the last few days from the High Commissioner for Pakistan.    Pakistan regardsherself as being now a special target for Russian opposition becauseshe has signed the Bagdad pact and the South East Asia treaty organisation,    I consider it as of the highest political importance tomeet Pakistan both over these ships and over the Bofors guns.6. I am ready to discuss more fully in Cabinet.    In the meantimeI append a more detailed statement,    I would only say at this stage that,accejjting as I do, the immense importance of econony, I regard as of paramount importance the political Considerations involved in thesecases, which as Commonwealth Secretary it is my duty to urge, and with every sympathy for the Chancellor&apos;s view, I would press my colleagues to meet me.
7. I should like to stress that no question of an arms race arises in any of these transactions.    It is clear that all the arms required arein themselves not unreasonable, having regard to the defence require-ments of the two countries.    Both India and Pakistan need these armsand intend to get them.    If they do not get them from us, they will doso from other less desirable source,&quot;,    However, I am myself concerned about the probability in the future of alternating demands from India and pakistan for arms and, if these items could be disposed of, I would gladlyconsult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the principles that shouldguide our future policy.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.I.2Cth January, 1956.ANNEXGeneralRelations with India and Pakistan are passing through a most difficult, and indeed critical, phase.    There is little doubt that in generalthe effect of the Soviet visit to India has been considerable.    &quot;V/e have,moreover, recently had reports that the old ties between Services in thiscountry and in India are much less strong in the Indian Air Force thanin the Army or Navy;  that the Russians have been making a big andunscrupulous effort to influence the younger Indian Air Force officers,and that their efforts have not been without some success.    Should Indiabuy a large number of Russian bombers the opportunities for furtherRussian contact and infiltration into the Indian Air Force will be greatlyincreased, the risks of further sales will become proportionately greater,and in the long run our strategic position will be greatly weakened.    TheChiefs of Staff are of opinion that we should do everything in our powerto prevent the Russians from penetrating the Indian Air Force by the saleof their aircraft, and that neither financial considerations nor Servicepriorities should be allowed to stand in the way if we could prevent thisdisaster by the supply of British aircraft.    They realise that the closercontact which is developing between India and Russia would increase thesecurity risks involved in the supply of British military aircraft to India,but consider that some degree of risk may have to be accepted.     ThePrime Minister moreover is most anxious that the deal should go through.IndiaCanberras1. Price is not the only, nor indeed even the major, consideration in order to achieve success.    We must also be able to provide the rightnavigational and bombing instruments and deliver them at the right time,but the price difference at the moment between the Russian and british aircraft is very great and we should do all we can to narrow the gap.
0772. Our High Commissioner has been warned by those elements in the Indian Government friendly to us of the great importance of meetingthe Indian requirements on Canberras so far as possible;  he has repeatedlystressed these arguments and has pointed out that if we can prevent the indians from accepting the Russian offer now we shall be over an importanthurdle and our success may make it easier to combat Russian efforts inother fields later.3. Whilst we are at the moment considering Russian competitionover the supply of bombers, we are also trying to sell Hunter fighters in competition with the French Mystere.    Hunters and Canberras bothhave Rolls Royce engines, and the sale of one aircraft will encourage thesale of the other as it will simplify engine maintenance.    This is a furtherreason for trying to effect the sale of Canberras.Pakistan(a) Ships4. I understand that the First Lord of the Admiralty will shortly be circulating a memorandum to the Defence Committee regarding thepossible sale of four destroyers and a cruiser to Pakistan.    This-paper has to be taken by the Defence Committee since it involves the re-allocation of our Naval resources.    I will therefore not go into the matter in detail here.    Briefly my proposal would be that we should sell thefive ships for  ljj millions.    They will qualify to be reconditioned inthis country through American off-shore funds and the dollar expenditurehere will be substantial - equivalent to some  3 millions,(b) Bofors Guns5. There is no doubt that Pakistan feels that by her alliance tothe West she has placed herself in an exposed position.    She has clearlyearned the hostility of Russia, as was evident at the time of the Bulganin-Khruschev visit to Asia, and she fears, with some cause, that the communists will seek every means to weaken her, particularly bybolstering up Afghanistan and encouraging a threat to Pakistan from that quarter.    In these circumstances, the Pakistanis feel that they areentitled to look to their friends for support.    They made this abundantly clear to me on my own visit to Pakistan and they have recently reinforcedthis view in a memorandum which the High Commissioner in London was instructed to present to the Prime Minister.    Some of the Pakistanifears may be exaggerated.    But there is no doubt that the pakistan government and Pakistan public opinion as a whole feel that they havenot received the support from the West to which they are entitled and,unless we stretch out the hand of friendship to them, there is a very real risk that the elements who are working for effective collaboration with us will be replaced by supporters of neutralism.6. We know, both from what has been said by the Pakistan HighCommissioner here and to my Principal Staff Officer during a recent visit to Pakistan, that the Pakistanis attach great importance to thepossibility of receiving the Bofors guns as a gift.    I realise that if wedo give them, we must take a calculated risk as regards India.    But I am prepared to deal with any criticism which may arise from that quarter*on the score that the guns are purely defensive equipment.    I realise,moreover, that a gift of this kind to Pakistan is likely to encouragesimilar hopes from other countries, notably those in the Middle East,if, indeed, they hear of it.    It is not for me to comment upon their
claims for similar treatment.    But if we are to turn them down we couldpoint to Pakistani position within the Commonwealth as a reason for herespecially favourable treatment.    Whilst we may be considering tnesetwo cases together, and whilst we cannot overlook the unfortunate rivalrybetween India and Pakistan, I regard each of these cases as very strongon its own merits and as not bearing some kind of mathematicalrelationship to the other.
