(56) 34th January, 1956CABINETSERVICE pay memorandum by the Minister of defence the Government have announced that a general review ofService pay is in hand and that decisions will be announced when service estimates are presented.2. Discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer have shownthat as regards objectives there is no great difference of opinion.    Thereis, however, disagreement on what is necessary to achieve thoseobjectives.3. There are three main aspects of the problem:-(l)      The pay of regular other ranks(2)      The pay of officers(3)      The pay of national servicemenRegular other ranks .4. At the present time far too few young men are making theServices their career.    We must strengthen the regular element of theForces.     This is essential if we are to avoid a continuing and dangerousdeterioration in the efficiency of all three Services.5. With the exception of the Royal Navy, where the minimumregular engagement is 7 years, most regular recruits do not commit themselves initially for more than 3 or 4 years.    A very small proportion(6 per cent in the case of the Army),  extend for a further period ofservice.6. If we are to build up our regular strengths, we must persuademany more young men to commit themselves on enlistment to remain with the Forces for much longer than 3 years and preferably for 9 years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agrees that we must offer financialattractions to secure this objective.    But we differ as to the amount.7. At present, a regular member of the Forces, on enlistment,receives in cash 73. a day, or 49s. a week.    After about 2 years, at about the age of 20, when he has become a trained man (R.N., AbleSeaman;  Army, 3-star Private;  R.A.F., Leading Aircraftman), he receives 9/6d. a day, or 66/6d. a week.    These rates were fixed inSeptember, 1950.    In March, 1954, certain selective pay increases were granted to technicians, non-commissioned officers and men of long service.-1-
G. Originally the Service Departments proposed that the recruit&apos;rate for a man who enlisted for 3 years should be 12s. a day, and for one who enlisted for 9 years should be 15/6d. a day.    The correspondingtrained man&apos;s rates were 15s. a day and lG/6d, a day.    In the courseof discussions with the Treasury tliis claim was abated and theChancellor of the Exchequer offered an improvement on his originalcounter-proposals.9. The present position is   -9-year EngagementService Claim      Treasury OfferRecruit                                14s. 12s.Trained man&apos;s rate            13s. 15s.3-year EngagementRecruit                                10s. 9s.Trained man&apos;s rate            13s. ll/6d.10.        Our revised proposals for regular other ranks would cost about  52.0 millions a year.    The cost of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s revised offer is estimated at about  34 millions a year.National Servicemen11. It is agreed that, in the interests of regular recruiting,increases in pay for national servicemen should be kept to the minimum which is politically defensible.    At present such a man receives 4s.a day, or 28s. a week, on enlistment, rising in most cases to 6s. a day(42s. a week) or more after about 12 months&apos; service.    The recruifsrate has not been increased since 1946.     To increase the rates of pay of all national servicemen by an average of Is. a day would cost about 5 millions a year.     To give no increase to men under 21 years, andto give those of that age or over an increase in pay of about Is. a day and improved rates of marriage allowance would cost about  2 millions ayear.Officers12. The improvements offered by the Chancellor of the exchequer would cost about  10 millions a year.    Our original proposals wouldhave cost  21.3 millions a year.    Cur revised proposals would cost 10.3 millions a year.    The following example indicates the measureof the difference between us.    We propose for an Army Captain anaverage increase of 12s. a day.    The Chancellor offers 7/6d. a day.W.M.Ministry of Defence, S.W01.3rd January, 1956.
