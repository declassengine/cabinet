(THJJ3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(56) 25 COPY NO.20th January, 1956CABINETDANISH BACONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will recall that on 11th January the Cabinet discussed the negotiations with the Danes on the proposal that the bulk purchasecontract for Danish bacon, which will come to an end in September, shouldbe replaced by a 10 per cent tariff on foreign supplies of bacon with duty-free entry for supplies from the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic(C.M. (56) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 2).     The purpose of such a tariff wouldbe to enable us to cease State trading, while safeguarding the Exchequer in whole or in part against the increased deficiency payments to Britishfarmers which would result from any fall in the price of foreign bacon.2.      The Danes have so far refused to accept the tariff proposals and,when the Economic Policy Committee at their meeting on 25th Januaryconsidered the progress of the tariff negotiations, they took the opportunityto consider again the respective merits of the tariff approach and of a continuance of the present system of bulk purchase contracts.     (Theremaining alternatives, of a quota or of unrestricted trading, are not realones:  the former would raise prices to the consumer and be contrary toour declared policy of freer trade and payments;   the latter would involvea heavy risk to the Exchequer. )    The Committee did not come to a final conclusion and my colleagues may now wish to give some further thought tothe financial and political considerations involved,3.      In favour of a tariff it can be urged that it enables us to stop state trading, it provides some offset for the Exchequer commitment for pigsubsidies, and it would give encouragement to our own producers.    More-over, we are not likely to find it easier to obtain Danish agreement to a tariff at a later date if we draw back from our previous view.    It has,however, the great political disadvantage that it would be represented asa tax on a major item of the peoplers food at a time when the cost of livingis much in pur thoughts.    I do not think that in this context the argumentmat the tariff would merely take the place of the profit on foreign baconobtained in recent years under State trading would carry much weight.4.      It is moreover open to question whether a tariff of only 1&quot;) per cent would serve to prevent flooding of the market by the Danes if they should attempt to maximise their profits by cutting prices and increasing thevolume of their sales.    In such an event the tariff might provide littleprotection against an increased Exchequer commitment in respect of deficiency payments to home producers.     And we might then have incurredall the political odium of a tariff on food without reaping any substantialfinancial benefit.-1-
5.      This may make it worth considering whether we might not be betteradvised to make a new bulk purchase contract with the Danes for, say,another three years, at the end of which the domestic conditions might bemore favourable to the imposition of a tariff.     The main difficulty in maintaining State trading is that of managing the sales of imported bacon.The Minister of Agriculture has strongly emphasised the unsatisfactorynature of the present position, in which Her Majesty&apos;s Government aretrading only in imported supplies but are saddled with responsibility forthe bacon market without effective control:  there are rapid fluctuations in the market and seasonal variations of home-produced supplies.     Thereis, therefore, much to be said for relinquishing a system of State trading in a market not fully under Government control and under which tradinglosses might well be incurred.6,      I invite my colleagues&apos; views on these issues.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.27th January, 1956.
