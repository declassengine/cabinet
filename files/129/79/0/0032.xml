this it is issued for the personal use of top secret copy No.U-lC.P.(56) 329th February, 1956CABINETECONOMIC situation note by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the Cabinet meeting of 24th January, I was asked to submitearly in February my firm proposals for dealing with the economicsituation (C. M, (56) 7th Conclusions).    In Appendix I to this note I haverecorded briefly the progress which has been made with the various suggestions I put forward.     The effect of the reductions proposed in investment expenditure is summarised in Appendix II.     I would proposeto make a full announcement about these measures at an early date.The most suitable date would be 15th February (Ash Wednesday), whenthe Vote on Account will be published and the totals of the Estimatesmade known.    Appendix III contains a draft.2.      The situation has not improved in the last two weeks.     There is little change in the labour situation;   and the trade figures for Januarywill show that the very disappointing trend in November and December hascontinued into January.    The adverse balance will be about  75 millions.It is true that in January there was a small increase in the reserves, butwe ought not to build too much on this.     This is the time of the year when our balance of payments is normally most favourable.    And we must remember that during 1955 we lost about a quarter of the reserves -^642 millions.3.      Short of carrying them to quite drastic and unreasonable lengths,the measures I propose are the most that I can suggest for immediate action without a dramatic departure from our present policies at homeand abroad.4.      But we certainly cannot do less than these.    Whether they willbe enough I cannot say.    We can only watch the x^osition and see whatmore is necessary from time to time.H0M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.3th February, 1956.
APPENDIX IThe Cabinet  discussed my paper (C. P. (56) 17) on 24th January,and asked me to submit revised proposals.    Here they are.     they represent largely the results of discussion with the Ministers concerned.For convenience, I have set them out in the order in which they appeared in my earlier paper.MONETARY MEASURES AND CREDIT policy .      I have had several discussions with the Governor of the Bank andthe commercial banks will press on with reducing the total of theiradvances.    In this connection, I have under consideration proposals for enabling the Exchequer to lend the capital they require to those nationalised industries which at present have to make stock issues on the market.Such relief to the technical management of the market would be ofassistance in our general monetary policy.    I am about to consult theMinisters concerned.3.      Hire purchase the President of the Board of Trade is prepared to make a furtherOrder to alter the present arrangements in three respects.First, it would tighten the restrictions on the terms of payment for consumer goods.     The President proposes to increase the percentagedown payment for motor-cars, radios and television sets, from 33-g- per cent to 40 per cent, and for furniture, bicycles and cookers, from 15 per cent to 20 per cent;   and, at the same time, to reduce the maximum period of repayment from two years to eighteen months.    For my part, I would ask that the 33j per cent rate should be put up to 50 per cent, and that weshould also make the reduction in the repayment period which thePresident proposes.Secondly, power would be taken to control the hiring of certain of these consumer goods.Thirdly, the control would be extended to a comprehensive range of capital goods.     The minimum down payment for these goods should be40 per cent or 50 per cent, whichever is decided for consumer goods.4.      Saving sVoluntary savings are very important in our present situation.Any policies designed to check inflation are the most effective encourage-ment we can give our people to increase their savings.    I am looking ata number of other suggestions, and I hope that some of them will featurein the Budget.INVESTMENT5.      British Transport commission i have discussed the investment programme of the Commission withthe Minister of Transport.    Originally the Commission had contemplatedan increase in investment over the whole range of their activities of
I I QII obetween  40 and  50 millions as compared with estimated expenditure in1955.    We have agreed on a slowing down of commitments, involving a cut of  12 millions in the railways programme and  10 millions in other activities.The effect will be that the increase in the total programme of theCommission will only be of the order of  20- 25 millions. It will stillallow a beginning to be made with the railway modernisation plan.6.      National Coal board the Minister of Fuel and Power has arranged for the national coal Board to reduce planned capital expenditure by  5 millions.    this reduction will not affect output, though it will have some effect in slowing down the improvement of the screening and cleaning facilities once thecoal has been won.7.      Central Electricity authority the Central Electricity Authority (which had previously reducedits original programme by some  7 millions) has now agreed to makea further cut of  10 millions on its programmes as submitted.     This will affect both generation, where there is a slowing-down of starts, anddistribution.    In this connection there will have to be a slowing-down of rural electrification;  nevertheless, the rural programme will not be abandoned.8.      Scottish Electricity BoardsThe two Scottish Electricity Boards between them have agreed toreduce their submitted programmes by some  3^- millions.9.      Gas Boards .The Gas Boards (who had previously reduced their originalprogrammes by some  5 millions) will now make a further cut of 5 millions on the programmes as submitted.10.    Air CorporationsThe Air Corporations will reduce their investment programmes by  I4 millions.11.     Atomic EnergyIn the total saving of over S. 20 millions for Government current expenditure (paragraph 14 of my draft Parliamentary statement), I have included  4 millions for minor re-adjustments which the Atomic energy authority have agreed to make in their investment programme for 1956-57without affecting mat programme itself, the high priority of which will,of course, continue to be an essential part of Government policy.    ButI should add that I am at present discussing with the Minister of defence the possibility of reductions in the programme which might yield further savings up to  5 millions in 1956-57.    Any such reductions will bediscussed with our colleagues in due course.
1&apos; i l12?    Post office the Postmaster-General will re-arrange his programme of telephone development in 1956-57 so as to restrict it to the amountactually being spent in 1955-565 instead of an increase of some  5 millions.There will also be delays in the starting of some new postal buildings which, although involving little immediate cash saving, will give someearly relief to the pressure on the building industry.13.    Development areas the Cabinet decided that, subject to certain special cases, no new commitments for factory building should be entered into for the time being.The proposed provision in the Estimates for the building of new factorieswill be cut from  6 millions to  5 millions.     The provision for financialassistance by the Treasury to enterprises in these Areas will be practically confined to existing commitments.14.     Government BuildingWe announced in October last the postponement of the projects onwhich it was possible to make large savings in 195 6-57.    Any further savings to be secured will be small and are covered by the figure of 20 millions in paragraph 14 of my draft Parliamentary statement.15,    Home defence the Home Secretary and the Minister of Defence have agreed tosome further reduction in the expenditure planned for 1956-57.     TheEstimates v/ill total  434 millions as compared with  70 millions for1955-56,     This reduction has been achieved by concentrating on the manning and equipping of the Home Defence organisation and by refraining from making further large additions of food and oil to the substantialstocks already held.16.    Miscellaneous Local Authority expenditure the water and sewerage programmes of local authorities will be controlled so as to confine the expenditure in 1956-57 to the level of1954-55.    For the remaining miscellaneous local services, nearly allthe Ministers concerned have agreed to give no further loan sanctionsfor a period of six months, except to enable projects in progress to becompleted or to meet really exceptional circumstances.    One or twominor points are outstanding;    The Ministers will send circulars to thelocal authorities to explain the new arrangements for the services withwhich they are respectively concerned.17.    New TownsCircumstances vary from case to case and it is not possible to lay down rules which will be applicable to them all.     The Minister of Housingtherefore proposes to write to the Chairmen of the New Town Corporationscalling attention to my statement, making clear that new towns cannot be exempt from the need to defer the starting of new capital projects when-ever possible, and asking them to say what action they can take to that end.
18,     education have discussed the expenditure on education building with theMinister of Education.There is already some delay in the 1955-56 programme which, inthe absence of special action, would add to the pressure caused by the1956-57 programme.    To avoid this, and to secure some reduction in thetotal demand hitherto proposed for 1956-57, the Minister of education has agreed - subject to other Departments deferring starts on the sames cale - to control the approval of new projects in prirrary and secondary schools in the following way:-(a) He will approve no more projects in the 1955-56programme, save in specially urgent cases.    Thisis expected to result in a carry-over of  20 millions of starts (i. e. the starting of new works, theultimate cost of which will be  20 millions) intonext year.(b) In any case he will control approvals so that 20 millions of starts is so carried forward andthat the total of starts in the first six months of1956-57 is not more than  25 millions.(c) He will operate in the second half of 1956-57 in sucha way that the total of starts for the whole of thatyear does not exceed  47 millions as against 57 millions planned in addition to the carry-over.(d) He will explain to local authorities that the 1956-57programme cannot all be started in that year andthat some starts will have to be postponed to an(unspecified) date in the following year.Similarly, the Secretary of State for Scotland has agreed to ensurethat  3 millions of starts from this year&apos;s programme will be carried over and that not more than  5 millions of work is started in the first sixmonths of 1956-57.19.    RoadsThe Minister has agreed, in addition to abandoning the  6 millions of projects mentioned at the previous meeting on 24th January, that theprevision for major improvements shall be reduced from  16 millions hehad proposed to  15-f millions and the provision for maintenance and minor improvements from  3 5;f millions to  34 millions.     (All thesefigures include Scotland).    Highway authorities are to be urged to spenda larger proportion of their allocation under the second head on minor improvements.GOVERNMENT CURRENT EXPENDITURE20.    defence the total net provision for active defence will be  1,499 millionsagainst an original total of  1,494 millions for 1955-56.    It must,however, be remembered that we are taking credit for  50 millions from
Germany for the year, which is at best uncertain.    The total Estimateswould, of course, have been much lower but for increases in Service pay and emoluments costing some  67 millions in all.21.    Food SubsidiesThe proposal which I put to the Cabinet on 24th January was thatthe bread subsidy should be discontinued and the price of milk raised byfd. per p&amp;ut-v-    I have reconsidered the timing of these measures in thelight of the Cabinet discussions.    I remain strongly of the opinion thatthey should be announced simultaneously with the other measures.2.     Since our last discussion I have come to the conclusion that, inorder to make these changes more acceptable and to meet what maycertainly be the hard case of those who depend on National Assistance, weshould encourage the National Assistance Board to increase their scales of assistance at an early date.     (See paragraph 1 7 of my draft parliamentary statement.)    An increase of 2s. 6d. in the scale would cost the Exchequer 13 millions a year, but it is probable that an increase will be necessaryanyhow by next autumn.23.    On the timing of the subsidy changes, I understand that theMinister of Agriculture would like the increase in the milk price delayed until the end of the flush period of milk,  say until 1st July, 1956.    as for the bread subsidy, I wish to give plenty of time for the Board to bringthe increased assistance scales into operation.     I suggest that abolitionof the subsidy should take effect in about six weeks&apos; time and that itshould be just preceded by the increases in the assistance scales.24.    Farm PricesThere is nothing more to be said on this subject until the talks withthe farmers have started.25.    School MealsI have discussed this with the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister ofEducation.     The alternatives are to increase the charge to Is. now or(a more attractive proposition) to introduce a radically new scheme in thelate summer;  the latter would involve the payment of the full cost of themeal, except where need was proved, and it could be a grant-aidedlocal authority service.    If the reductions in the bread and milk subsidiesare approved, I would advise dropping the proposal for an immediate increase in the charge and waiting for the full reorganisation, provided the latter is not unduly delayed.26.    AdministrativCostsThe Treasury are now working out the steps necessary to giveeffect to the Cabinet decision about the further reduction in Civil Servicenumbers..
&quot;      1 9C;-lL kl hiIMPORTS27.    It is vitally&quot; important to save as much as possible on our importbill.28.    The Minister of Fuel and Power has already agreed to a postpone-ment of lj million tons of our coal imports, which will result in a saving of  10jr millions in 1956.29.    Similarly, I am asking the Minister of Food to agree to use asmuch as possible of the trading stocks of sugar at present held by theGovernment (400, 000 tons) in replacement of imports.    The maximumsaving which could be obtained would be about  14 millions.30.    I am also proposing to the Minister of Defence and the Presidentof the Board of Trade that we should try to sell some  50 millions worth of our strategic reserves of raw materials during the coming year, witha corresponding saving in imports.     These stocks amount to some 200 millions, and on our latest strategic assumptions it is unlikelythat, the whole of them will be needed.     This, of course, does not affectstrategic stocks of food.31. By these measures, I would hope to save about  70 millions. In&apos;addition to this, timber stocks are expected to fall by about  30 millions.Thus we can hope to save, without direct import cuts, some  100 millions.3 2.    I have no further proposals to make at present.

APPENDIX IIIDRAFT PARLIAMENTARY statement i wish to make a statement about certain measures whichthe Government have taken, or propose to take, arising out ofthe economic situation.      [As the House will wish to debatethem - and we are prepared to arrange a debate for tomorrow -I propose to state them somewhat briefly today;    but I shall,of course,  explain and justify them more fully in the debate.]2.     Before, however, dealing with the wider field, I should like to refer to the current expenditure of the centralGovernment.      The expenditure which we propose for 1956-57will be made known in the Defence White Paper to be publishedtomorrow, and in the Civil Vote on Account which is publishedtoday.      I should like to say a word about the new figures,since these go to make up the total- demand on the economywith which we have to deal.3.     The Defence total will be  19k99 millions net, as againstthe original Estimates of  l,h9h millions for 1955-56.     Asthe White Paper will show, we have carried out a comprehensive and forward-looking review of our defence effort.      In this wehave had regard both to the needs of the new strategic situa-tion and to the dangers of overloading the economy with thecost of defence, whether in terms of manpower, materials ormoney.      The total Estimates for Defence would have been much lower but for the increases in Service pay and emoluments whichare to cost  67 millions in all.k&quot;     The Civil Estimates, at  [2,1481] millions will show anincrease of  [112] millions over the original Estimates for1955-56:    of the increase, the Social Services account for [99] millions.5.      It will be seen that the total estimates, defence and civil are  [117] millions more than those presented at this time last year.     This represents a rise of about 3 per cent./If
If the Government had not exercised the most rigorous check,the increases in Service and Civil Service pay, in wagesgenerally and in the costs of all the supplies needed for theGovernment services would of themselves have carried the totalof the Estimates to far higher figures.      But we have madevigorous and sustained,efforts, initiated by my Et. Hon. friend the Lord Privy Seal and continued by me since I took up my present office, with the help of all my colleagues, to reducethe total.      The fact is that rises in Education,  the health service and Service Pay more than account for the net total increase..     Over the rest of the field, notwithstandingdevelopments such as those of Atomic Energy and roads, we have brought the total estimates below this year&apos;s figure.      In theend, allowing for the rise in prices the total of this year&apos;estimates will be below last year&apos;s in real terms, that is intheir demand on labour and materials.One might say of the estimates as a whole what was saidof the roads in Scotland two hundred years ago:-&quot;Had you known these roads before they were made,You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.&quot;6.     We shall continue our efforts to reduce the total of public expenditure and shall not hesitate to ask the country to accepta reduction of existing services if we judge it at any timeproper and expedient to do so.     We shall also pursue a continuous search for further administrative economies.      Wehave already carried this so far that, short of changes in policy, such economies cannot yield large sums;    but as an earnest of our intentions I would remind the House that in his recent speech at Bradford the Prime Minister said that ourtarget was a reduction in the staffs of Government Departmentsby a further 10,000 to 15,000,7o     Now I come to a wider view.      There is general agreement that our resources have been overloaded by the combined demands/of
of investment and consumption.     This has held back our exports, swollen our imports, forced us into balance of paymentsdeficit, helped to reduce our reserves by one-quarter, anddriven up our domestic price level.     After much study of developments during the past few weeks under all these heads,I have come to the conclusion that further measures arerequired.     The more quickly they are applied., the more effec-tive they will be.      We must make a still more determinedattack on the roots of the trouble and enforce still further reductions in investment and consumption.8.      In the monetary field,  the reduction in bank advances hasaccomplished a good deal, but I must look to the banks tocontinue their efforts to reduce the total of their advances.9.     Another form of restricting credit is the regulation ofthe terms of hire purchase.     We propose to tighten up thepresent arrangements in three ways.     First, the minimum downpayments for consumer goods will be increased from the present33s% and 13% to 50% and 20% respectively, and the maximumrepayment reduced from two years to eighteen months.      Second,power will be taken to contol hiring of certain of these goods.Third, the control will be extended to a comprehensive range of capital goods subject to a 50% down payment and maximumrepayment period of eighteen months.10.    Credit restrictions are designed to slow down investment and consumption in the private sector of the economy.      Iwould also appeal to businessmen who are able to financeinvestment out of their own resources to apply the same testsas to the timing and rate of their investment as if they hadto borrow.11.   But the Government must also play its part in thiscampaign through the public authorities and departments over which it has control.      I have therefore made a full review ofall these cases with the Ministers concerned.      Useful works-/already
already started must be completed with all expedition.     Butwe shall delay some works not yet started so as to reduce, as quickly and by as much as possible, our&apos; demands on productiveindustry, especially building and heavy engineering.12.      I will deal first with the nationalised industries.     Asa result of previous requests they had already reduced their programmes of capital expenditure in 1956 before submittingthem to their appropriate Ministers.      They have readily co-operated further and by reassessing priorities and by rephasingthey have now further reduced their programmes, as submitted,by just under  50 millions.      In the result, the total capitalexpenditure of the Fuel and Power industries should be some 20 millions less than in 1955*     0n the other hand, theBritish Transport Commission, although they have agreed to substantial reductions in their 1956 programmes, must spendmore than in 1955, in order to make a start with their majorplan for re-equipping and speeding up the railways.13*    The contributions of the various authorities are:-National Coal Board       .,        ..  5 millionsCentral Electricity Authority  10 millions( 5 millions on generationand  5 millions on distribution)The two Scottish Electricity Boards  3:1 millionsThe Gas Council and Area Boards       ..       5 millionsBritish Transport Commission ..       22 millionsThe two Airways Corporations %-(\^^t^*.       2^niillionslh*    Next, capital expenditure financed direct by the CentralGovernment will be reduced by over  20 millions in all below what had been planned for 1956.      Towards this the Post Office,by rearranging its programmes, will find  5^ millions;    andthe restriction of storage facilities and stockpiling for home Defence will save  10 millions on the original plan./The
The New Town Corporations are also being asked to defer the starting of new capital projects wherever possible.     We donot propose any delays in the programme of Hospital buildingalready announced.15*    The same principles must he applied to the capital programmes of Local Authorities.As regards Housing, the Government&apos;s proposals have beenembodied in the Bill now before the House.Under Education, while there will be no cut in thegeneral plan, my Bt. Hon. Friend the Minister of Education isrevising the phasing of the programme with two main objectsin view - first,  to reduce the load on our physical resources in the immediate future;    and second, to make more rapid progress with schools already started.     My Et. Hon. Friendwill be issuing a circular to explain the necessary arrangement to the Local Atithorities.      There will be comparable arrange-ments in Scotland.The grant of loan sanctions for other capital schemes ofLocal Authorities will have to be severely restrained, savewhere there are exceptional circumstances.     The sanctioningMinisters will be sending circulars to Local Authorities toexplain the new arrangements for the services with which theyare concerned.16.    Finally, I must refer again to the question of the current expenditure of the central Government.      This, as I have said,makes part of the total demand on our resources and we cannot  .allow any expenditure for which there is not full justificationSo far nearly all the decisions of the Government, whether in the monetary or in the physical sphere, bear principallyon investment.     We regret the need for this;    but eveninvestment, on which our future prosperity depends so much,cannot be allowed to outrun our resources of men and materialsor to make excessive demands on the balance of payments./Equally,
AJ .Equally, our direct subsidies to consumption, irrespective of need, cannot be justified on their present scale.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided upon tworeductions in the Pood Subsidies^First, we propose to abolish the bread subsidy as fromthe [ ].     This subsidy costs about  UO millions ayear.      The price of bread will henceforward reflect its truecost in a competitive market.Secondly, ordinary milk - not school or welfare milk -is subsidised to the extent of  37 millions a year.     we propose to halve the subsidy by raising the maximum retail price of milk by ^d. a pint as from [ ]*      Thiswill save the taxpayer  20 millions of subsidy in e. full year,17.    In present circumstances, with full employment and highwages, these subsidies can no longer be justified.      Theprice increases may, however, press hardly on those whodepend on National Assistance and in order to meet this I have informed the Chairman of the National Assistance Board ofthe changes we propose in order that the Board may considerwhether they wish to make any recommendations to the Ministerof Pensions and National Insurance before the changes take effect.18.    I have now completed my account of the results of the review which the Government have made of the whole range ofpublic expenditure, capital and current.The reductions we have been able to make in the capitalexpenditure of the Government and of the nationalised industries will reduce the pressure of demand in 1956 by some 70 millions.      The savings on the Pood Subsidies will add 60 millions to that figure, making the total relief about 130 millions.To this must be added - though I cannot put a figure on/them
13JDthem at this stage - the reductions in outlay which will result from the rephasing of Local Authorities&apos; capitalexpenditure.Finally, we must expect that the continuing,  and - inthe case of Hire Purchase - the still tighter restriction of credit will achieve a more definite slowing-down of demand from private industry and the consumer.19.    In all these measures I believe we are taking actionwhich, by assisting the fight against inflation, will hebeneficial tp every class and household in the country.Never before has the standard of living been so high or generalwell-being so widespread.     Never before has every individualhome had so great a stake in the continued prosperity andsolvency of Britain.      I believe, therefore, that although these measures will necessarily result in some sacrifice or some disappointment they will be accepted as wise and timely.
