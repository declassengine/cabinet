Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1956SECRET Copy No. 4CP. (56) 4117th February, 1956CABINETNUCLEAR WEAPONSNote by the Prime minister circulate for the information of my colleagues, some correspondence whichI have had with the Archbishop of Canterbury about nuclear warfare. I alsoattach the draft of a further reply to the Archbishop based on a draft kindlyprepared by the Minister of Defence.I propose to send this reply to the Archbishop on February 22, provided that none of my colleagues has any objection.A. E.10 Downing Street,15th February, 1956.
My dear Prime Minister, 23 rd January, 1956.Before you leave for the U.S.A., I ought, I think, to represent to you that thereis an anxious and growing opinion among the Churches that the British and american Governments must take a fresh initiative now in the field of disarmament and atomic warfare if the situation is to be kept under any kind of moral control.It is possible to justify the existence of the H-bomb so long as it is a deterrent.You have just done so publicly, and I have recently done the same. But it isknown to all parties that the use of the H-bomb in a war would destroy anddevastate both sides beyond endurance. Since its use would be only a final act of suicide, the H-bomb is losing its power as a real deterrent. A local war couldbe conducted with impunity since neither side would dare to use the H-bomb,thereby making the local war into a global war of mutual extermination. Thusany moral justification of the H-bomb daily decreases, and the revolt of the christian conscience against the very existence of such an inhuman and nihilisticweapon multiplies.May I add a few notes, though they can hardly add to your own thinkingin this matter.1. I am told by some in close touch with U.N.O. and the U.S.A. Governmentthat the disarmament discussions have reached a critical point where ground maybe lost instead of gained unless the British Government can give a vigorous leadwhen the disarmament sub-committee reconvenes. Can that lead be given, and how, in such a field sown with dragons&apos; teeth?2.   The immediate problem is threefold, to achieve:  (a) Some reduction in all armaments.(h) Prohibition of the manufacture or use of some means of destruction.(c) A control, which will ensure that any agreement is observed.Each nation tends to emphasise one of these three aspects at a time and to bedifficult about the others. No progress is possible unless the most powerful nationscan move together. Cannot a programme of slow but simultaneous advance ineach one of these three directions be pressed and publicised?1. There must be control, but it need not be completely foolproof so longas it is accompanied by advance in the other two directions: andalong the lines of your own plan, it might start from a pilot inspectionproject.2. Levels of reduction were proposed by the United Kingdom and France last march and agreed to by the Russians in May; cannot they be accepted as they stand in this context of three-fold advance?3. Prohibitions of any sort are difficult indeed, but as I indicate in the nextnote, there seems to be a possibility here calling for exploration; anda formal agreement to explore it immediately and urgently would helpgreatly.Along such lines of concurrent advance could not we and the U.S.A. givea fresh impetus to the whole affair?3. The heart of the problem lies in the prohibition of such intolerable evilsas the existence of the H-bomb; and the difficulties in securing prohibition of its
use altogether are almost insurmountable. But can they be circumvented? Youare familiar with proposals for distinguishing between the strategic use and the tactical use of nuclear weapons. I am told that such a distinction can be made the strategic H-bomb being indiscriminate, suicidal, universal; the tactical bombof limited power being localised in effect and controllable.Those who are asking for this matter to be explored, generally argue that itwould enable a convention not to bomb great centres of population. That would of course be an immense relief to conscience. But I should not wish to bring it into this discussion. There can be endless arguments about that kind of convention and abuses of it are easy. But if a real distinction is possible between the H-bomb,of the uncontrollable power on the one side and the limited and localised atombomb on the other, then no convention is needed; an unilateral declaration canbe made effectively.If we said that in any local war, we would use limited atom weapons up toan x degree of strength and no more unless and until our opponents went above that degree, a secure position is gained. The fact that this known and limiteddegree of strength effective within its own limits will be used becomes a real and practical deterrent. Those on the other side will know what they would be in for.Equally they would know that if they went above that level, they would start a process that would end in the H-bomb.The situation would thus come under moral control once again. The H-bombwould no longer dominate the situation. Interest would be transferred to theatom bomb of limited power as a known possibility. Thus the evil of the H-bombmight be circumvented and finally forgotten and go out of mind.The moral argument for an exploration here is overwhelming. I am told that on scientific and military grounds there is abundant justification for a fulland authoritative investigation. Could that investigation be authorised? Andif at the same time there could be agreement to prohibit any more experimentalexplosions of H-bombs, that would greatly help both the moral issue and thepublic morale. Is it not true that in fact these experimental explosions serve no practical purpose? As a man can drown just as easily in 10 feet of water as in50 fathoms of it, so civilisation can perish just as thoroughly by means of thepresent H-bomb as by any further development of it.4. The fact is that we and the U.S.A. must for our own sakes and for theworld&apos;s safety recapture the moral initiative in &quot;this field. Russia is so placedthat she can with apparent sincerity proclaim herself as the only friend of peace and the only nation that sincerely wants to abolish the H-bomb, while at the sametime obstructing every practical form of co-operative and trustful advance. our reply of &quot; deterrence &quot; by the existence of the H-bomb while so far effective is a diminishing asset; and anyhow it is at its evil best defensive only. Christians aredeeply perturbed: their prayer is that by means of your conversations with president Eisenhower a step may be clearly and constructively taken which restoresthe moral and Christian initiative in a territory so devil-possessed.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) GEOFFREY CANTUAR.The Rt. Hon. Sir Anthony Eden, K.G., P.C., M.C.
His Grace the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.My dear Archbishop, January 24, 1956.I have your letter of January 23 about the problems presented by the H-bomband atomic warfare.My colleagues and I have already given long and anxious thought to thesedifficult questions. Our discussions have led us to the conviction that we must continue to possess the deterrent of the H-bomb.On the eve of my departure for the United States I cannot do more than statethat my opinion on this matter remains unchanged. I will, however, give your letter further careful thought during my journey, and I will send you a detailedcomment on your letter as soon as I can.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) ANTHONY EDEN.
DRAFT LETTER TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURYMy colleagues and I have given most careful thought to your letter of23rd January, 1956, in which you raise with me certain grave issues relating tonuclear weapons and disarmament.You say that, since its use would be only a final act of suicide, the H-bomb islosing its power as a deterrent, and that a local war could therefore be conducted with impunity, since neither side would dare to use the H-bomb and thus convertthe local war into a global war of mutual extermination.If I may say so, I cannot agree with this view. I do not think that the H-bombwill lose its deterrent power when both sides possess it in quantity. We start fromthe position that the West will never be the aggressor, a position which has recentlybeen repeated in the Declaration of Washington, with its clear statement that&quot; we shall never initiate violence.&quot; Surely it is what Russia thinks would happen to her if she started aggression, whether directly or indirectly, that is the governingfactor in the cautious and calculating minds of her rulers, and not what injuryshe could do to them in return if her aggression were countered by the use of the-bomb. This is the real deterrent, and it will be weakened only if the resolveof the West to deal with aggression is undermined by fear of the possible consequences to itself. The maintenance of this resolve is surely the greatestguarantee of peace, since so long as it is maintained the Russians will hesitate to provoke even minor local aggression for fear of beginning a process which will lead to so fearful a catastrophe.This is, however, not to say that any move by Russia should she be rashenough to make one, would inevitably be countered by the use of the H-bomb.The doctrine of economy of force, which is the basis of all sound military action,still applies to-day. It is not possible to be specific in discussing hypotheticalsituations, but I can certainly conceive of circumstances in which local aggressioncould be dealt with effectively by local retaliation only. This local retaliationmight well involve the use of nuclear weapons on tactical objectives, and I do notbelieve that the use of these weapons in such circumstances would necessarilylead to the full horror of global war. No government could in my view defineprecisely in advance the circumstances in which it would use some weapons butnot others, and any attempt at delimitation in advance would, I am sure, not beto the advantage of the West. Nor is it scientifically possible any longer to drawany clear line of distinction between the various types of nuclear weapons; thespectrum is continuous between the smallest weapon of kiloton yield and thelargest with a yield of tens of megatons. It is for these reasons that I feel wecould not accept your suggestion for a statement that we would limit the powerof weapons that we should use in particular circumstances.Ever since the last war, at the end of which we were all appalled by the powerof nuclear weapons, we have sought agreement on a comprehensive plan of disarmament. Time and again we have put forward proposals, either on our owner with our allies. At each turn we have been held up by the Soviet Union.The Russians have never shown signs of accepting any realistic proposals for inspection and control. It was in the face of this that at the last meeting of theGeneral Assembly we advocated the idea of starting with a smaller measure of
disarmament so that the unresolved difficulties of control, particularly of nuclear weapons, should not block all progress. The General Assembly overwhelminglyendorsed our idea, but the Russians opposed it.I am not sure whether it is true to say that the disarmament discussions havereached a critical point. In one sense they have reached a rather hopeful point,for the great majority of member States have recognised the importance of makinga start with disarmament instead of only talking about it. This is perhaps theresult of the impetus we tried to give the discussions on disarmament at the SummitConference.You say that though there must be control it need not be completely foolproof.In dealing with what we have come to think of as conventional armaments one cancontemplate a system of control which is not completely foolproof. In the caseof nuclear weapons, even a small margin of deception might prove disastrous tothe world.   One simply cannot afford to take even the smallest risk.The use of atomic energy for civil purposes, which will be a great benefit in raising standards of living throughout the world, will bring into being ever-increasing amounts of fissile material which could be used by the ill-disposedfor the clandestine manufacture of weapons without any serious risk of detection.Moreover, large stocks of such weapons already exist, and there is no means yet known of establishing beyond doubt that these stocks had in fact been entirelydestroyed were such a course ever to be internationally agreed. Unless therefore we had an absolutely watertight system of control, we should risk putting the powerto dominate the world into the hands of a country in whose good faith we couldnot trust. It would not be reasonable to expect the West to run such a risk indealing with Russia and&apos; those who have aligned themselves, or who have beenforcibly aligned, with her.In the meantime, the best hope of preserving peace is for the West to remain&quot; the strong man armed.&quot; If it is to remain strong it cannot tie its hands inadvance, but must retain full freedom to deal with any situation that may arisean the way it thinks best. In the last analysis, it is the values by which we livethat are decisive in determining our course of action. Our civilisation is founded on our belief in the value of the individual, and our opposition to Communismrests upon our refusal to tolerate the degradation of the individual caused by theelevation of the State into a position of absolute power. Surely therefore it is right,in the face of the threat which menaces us, to take all the precautions that maybe necessary to preserve those beliefs and way of life without which we should cease to be what we are.
