confidential cp. (56) 9 COPY NO. s39th January, 1956CABINETBURAIMIMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since 26th October, 1955, when the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and the sultan of Muscat re-asserted their authority in the Buraimi Oasis and her Majesty&apos;s Government declared unilaterally the frontier betweenAbu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, we have been under constant pressure fromthe Americans to re-open and settle the affair by the resumption ofarbitration in some form or by negotiations.     The representatives of friendly States, and even the Egyptians, have also pointed out that our attitude leaves no room for manoeuvre to those anxious to help us to secureSaudi acquiescence in our action.2.        We must firmly resist any pressure to induce us to return to arbitration.     The irretrievable distortion of the views of the local tribes-people by Saudi actions and the certainty that they will adopt similarmethods, no matter what form of control is instituted in any futurearbitration, make it almost inevitable that we should lose.     The spread ofa rumour that we have agreed to re-open the arbitration would be sufficientto bring local tribespeople at best back onto the fence and at worst ontothe Saudi side.     There would be repercussions on our position in the otherGulf States.     We should in any case have the greatest difficulty in persuad-ing the Rulers for whom we act that it was in their interests to resumearbitration.     In short, a return to arbitration must be ruled out entirely.3.        For similar reasons we must refuse direct negotiations with theSaudis on Buraimi, though we would of course still be willing to discuss the minor rectifications to the frontier to which the Prime Minister referred in his statement of 26th October (text annexed).4.        Despite the necessarily rather inflexible background to ourposition, we have made two gestures to the Saudis since the re-occupationof Byraimi;-(a)    In a Note to the Saudi Government of 21st November, 1955,we stated that the two countries &quot;might hope tore build the firm friendship which existed in the timeof his late Majesty, King Ibn Saud.     To this endHer Majesty&apos;s Government would not fail to examine and discuss with the Saudi Arabian Government any practical suggestions for improving Anglo-Saudirelations, which the Saudi Government may wish tomake, and they would draw attention in particular to the statement made by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons on 26th October, expressing their
readiness at all times to discuss with the SaudiGovernment any minor rectifications of the existingline which may seem convenient in the light of local circumstances(b)    A message to King Saud was sent through his unofficialrepresentative in Bahrain in the middle of december last.    In this we intimated that we were interestedin the idea of talks with the Saudis though we couldnot alter our position regarding Buraimi and the frontiers.     The message suggested that,M, Ambassador should see King Saud in Riyadh,the Saudi capital, and expressed our view that therewere a number of matters of mutual interest whichcould profitably be discussed.5.        So far neither of these approaches has met with any response.Nor has King Saud been willing to receive H.M. Ambassador (who arrived in Jedda on 6th November, 1955) to present his credentials.6.        Although we have no direct information from the Saudi Government,the United States Government think that, if their efforts to persuade us toreturn to arbitration or to.negotiate fail,- fee Saudis may well appeal to theSecurity Council,,   In that event, as a party to the dispute, v/e should not havethe right of veto. But provided the United States did not work activelyagainst us we should hoxoe to secure a sufficient number of abstentionsto prevent any vote being carried against us.     This fact, no doubtapparent to the Saudis, and the certainty of unpleasant revelations ofbribery and corruption may be the explanations of their tardines s in referring the matter to the Council.    I do not think that we should makeany move under a Saudi threat of reference to the Security Council.    Ifit is referred we should stand firm, although we shall have to be carefulabout well-meaning attempts by our friends to produce compromiseformulae,7.        Our position in South-East Arabia and the Persian Gulf is of suchvital importance to us that we cannot compromise on this issue.    i therefore propose that when the Prime Minister and I go to Washington(and in the preliminary talks conducted by officials before our arrivalthere), we should adopt the following attitude(i)     V/e should make it clear that the United Kingdom couldnot in any case agree to resume arbitration overBuraimi.    Nor could we agree to negotiate on thesubstance of Buraimi and the frontier betweenAbu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, except in regard tothe &quot;minor rectifications&quot; to which the PrimeMinister has already referred.(ii) At the same time v/e should make what play is possible of our willingness to talk to the Saudis, instancingour two gestures at paragraph 4 above, and point-ing our that the Saudi acts of the withdrawal of the saudi Ambassador from London and King Saud&apos;refusal to receive H. M. Ambassador have madedirect contacts very difficult.
(iii)     We should do all in our power to bring the americans to understand the Tightness of our actions and themalpractices of the Saudis;   and seek to persuade them,  should the matter ever reach the Security-Council, not to work against us.i.L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.9th January, 1956.ANNEXSTATEMENT MADE DY THE PRIME minister in THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 26TH OCTOBER, 1955&quot;With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement on thesituation in South-East Arabia.&quot;The House may recall that on 28th July, 1954 I reported that agreement had been reached with the Saudi Arabian Government to submit the Buraimi frontier dispute to arbitration.    I expressed the hope thatthis agreement would enable us to resume the traditionally friendly relations between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Saudi ArabianGovernment.&quot;I am sorry to have to tell the House that these hopes have beendisappointed.     The proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal at Genevahave broken down and the British member of the Tribunal and itsBelgian President have resigned.     The reasons for these events were explained in detail in a statement issued by the Foreign Office on 4th October.    I have just learned that Dr. Dihigo, one of the tworemaining members of the Tribunal appointed as a neutral, has alsoresigned.&quot;For many years, Her Majesty&apos;s Government sought to reach anagreement in these matters by negotiating with the Saudi Arabian Govern-ment.     These efforts led only to steadily increased Saudi claims againstthe territory of two Arab Rulers, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and the Sultanof Muscat.    Finally, in August, 1952, in the region of Buraimi, the saudi official Turki bin Ataishan, after passing through the territory ofthe Ruler of Abu Dhabi, invaded the territory of the Sultan of Muscatand established himself in a village belonging to the Sultan.&quot;Despite this Provocative act, Her Majesty&apos;s Government continuedto seek a solution by peaceful means, and dissuaded those local leaderswho wished to meet force by force.     For two years Turki remained in
Buraimi, seeking to extend Saudi influence in the area.    In 1954, her majesty&apos;s Government advised the two Arab Rulers to submit their case to arbitration.    An Arbitration Agreement was drawn up which it was hoped would lead to a settlement and to more friendly relations,&quot;The Saudi Arabian authorities have systematically disregardedthe conditions of arbitration which were then agreed upon.     The &quot;police&quot;group which they were permitted to keep in the Buraimi Oasis for the solepurpose cf maintaining law and order was, in fact, led by politicalofficers who persistently exceeded their functions.    Bribery and intimidate-tion on a wide scale have taken place in the disputed areas, with theresult that it is no longer possible, I regret to say, to estimate wherethe loyalties of the inhabitants lay before Turki&apos;s armed incursion.     the ruler of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat have scrupulously observedthe conditions of arbitration which Her Majesty&apos;s Government, in good faith, recommended to them.     They have had to stand by and watchtheir subjects being suborned, and the outcome of the arbitration itselfbeing gravely prejudiced in advance.    A fair and impartial arbitrationis not possible in such circumstances.&quot;These facts, combined with the conduct of the Saudi Governmentin relation to the Tribunal itself, have led Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto conclude that the Sa.udi Arabian Government are no more willing nowto reach an equitable solution by arbitration than they were, previouslyby negotiation.     Their actions and conduct amount to a repudiation of the arbitration Agreement, and have made a continuation of the arbitrationimpossible.&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, felt obliged, in theexercise of their duty, to protect the legitimate interests of the Ruler ofAbu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat, to advise them that the attempt toreach a just compromise by means of arbitration has failed. The forcesof these Rulers, supported by the Trucial Oman levies, have accordinglythis morning taken steps to resume their previous control of the BuraimiOasis, and areas to the west of it.&quot;My latest information is that the Saudi force has been evacuated from the Buraimi Oasis, its only casualties being two men slightly woundecThey are being cared for by our forces.&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Rulers concerned have nodoubt that, as a matter of law, they would be entitled to regard as a fairfrontier between the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia the line many inthis House know as the 1952 line, claimed in their recent Memorial beforethe Tribunal.    However, while fully reserving their legal rights in that respect Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decided with the agreement ofthe Rulers, in order to act in as reasonable and conciliatory a manner aspossible, to declare and uphold a line which is more favourable to SaudiArabia.    In 193 5, when the present dispute may be said to havecrystallised, a line, which is known as the Riyadh Line, was put forward by Her Majesty*s Government.    It involved substantial concessions tothe Saudi Arabians.     This line was further modified in 193 7 in favour ofSaudi Arabia and it is this modified line that we are now declaring asthe frontier.    The Saudi Arabian Government are being informed ofthese decisions.
id 5&quot;I regret that this step should have been necessary.    But, asnegotiations and arbitration have both failed, we have no other means ofhonouring our obligations and standing by our friends.     I hope that intime  the Saudi Arabian Government will accept the solution that we havehad to declare.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government are ready at all times todiscuss with the Saudi Arabian Government any minor rectifications ofthe line which may seem convenient in the light of local circumstances, &quot;
