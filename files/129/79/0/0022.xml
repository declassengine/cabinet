secret.P.(56) 2224th January, 1956COTTONMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will recall that in the early part of last year strong representations were made by the cotton industry to Her Majesty!s Govern-ment for some protection against the duty-free entry of cheap cotton cloth from India and Hong Kong.    These representations culminated in ameeting  with the former Prime Minister on 24th March,    The fullestconsideration was given to the case presented by the Cotton Board delega-tion at that meeting but it was decided (C.M. (55) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3)that the industry&apos;s case must at that time be rejected on grounds of broadcommercial policy.     The Prime Minister conveyed this decision in astatement in the House of Commons on 3rd May when he said:-&quot;At the same time we have had under consideration the separate question of the level of imports of duty-free clothfrom the Commonwealth.    We would be reluctant to take action against imports from India, particularly action whichwould discriminate against India compared with other partsof the Commonwealth.    Special considerations of colonial policy arise in the case of Hong Kong.    We are not prepared,at this time and in existing circumstances, to depart from our long established arrangements for duty-free entry fromthe Commonwealth. &quot;COPY NO./cabinet.        The Cotton Board have now submitted to me another memorandum in which they again seek protection against imports of cotton cloth from theCommonwealth.     Their case, which is argued at great length, is substantially the same as before and may be summarised as follows:-(i)     It is an accident of history that the United Kingdomcotton industry is without any protection at allagainst the entry of cotton piece goods from theCommonwealth.    No other textile industry any-where suffers from a comparable disadvantage.(ii) The inequity of this position is such that the industrydoes not believe that it would be as difficult for theGovernment to set it right as is maintained.(iii)     It is the incursions into the industry&apos;s home market which are resented and feared.     Confidence hasbeen undermined by the possibility that the high rate of imports may go on increasing indefinitely.-1-
(iv)     The undermining of confidence has led to the closure of mills and will work against investment inmodernised plant and machinery.(v)    In any case, however efficient the United kingdom industry might make itself, it could never compete with the prices at which cotton piece goods are sold from India and Hong Kong.(vi)     The industry therefore seeks protection, in the firstplace by means of a quot^.    Subsequently theGovernment should introduce whatever form of long-term protection it considered the mostpracticable.3.        These are essentially the considerations which were before usin the spring.    Meanwhile, the difficulties of restricting duty-freeimports from Commonwealth sources have in no way diminished.     Theimposition of a quota on Indian and Hong Kong cloth could jeopardise our policy of Imperial Preference and of trade liberalisation.4.        Since the Prime Minister^ statement in May, 1955, there hasin fact been a slight improvement in the situation in the industry.Towards the end of 1955 production began to increase again, short time working (in any case only in part attributable to imports) grew less, andorder books began to lengthen.    Above all, the level of imports has not shown the alarming rise during the last three quarters of 1955 which wasprophesied by the industry when it saw the former Prime Minister inMarch, 1955.    Although total imports in 1955 were higher than in 1954,their rate was considerably less in the last three quarters of 1955 thanin the last quarter of 1954 and the first quarter of 1955.    Moreover, therate of forward ordering does not presage any sharp increase in theimmediate future.    Finally, although United Kingdom exports of cotton textiles have in total continued to decline, those to India have considerably increased since the Indian Government reduced its tariff last Mayfollowing our representations.5.        In these circumstances I propose to inform the Cotton board in as sympathetic terms as possible, tha.t there are at present no grounds for any change in the existing policy as enunciated by thePrime Minister last May.6.        I have good reason to believe that this decision will come as no surprise to the Cotton Board who are, after all, campaigning - andon rather less favourable ground - for something which, with all its political implications, was examined and rejected just before theGeneral Election.    I am most anxious that in announcing my decisionI shall not cause the Cotton Board to lose the confidence of the industryand I therefore propose to invite them to bring a deputation from theindustry to see me, thank them for the thorough study they have madein support of their case, explain why the Government must in thepresent circumstances reject it and undertake that I shall continue tokeep the situation under close review.7.        I trust my colleagues will agree,Board of Trade, S.W.1.23rd January, 1956.
