CONFIDENTIALC0P.(56) 4621st February, 1956CABINETTECHNOLOGICAL education memorandum by the Lord Privy seal i would invite my colleagues&apos; attention to one aspect of the draft white paper (C, P. (56) 40) which particularly impressed the group ofMinisters who, under my Chairmanship, supervised its preparation.2.      If this White Paper is to tell a complete story, it must include some reference to technological education at the Universities as distinct from the technical colleges.     The Universities are dealt with in Chapter II(paragraphs 47-54).    In drafting this chapter.-, we have encountered twodifficulties s-(a) There is, at the moment, nothing new that we can sayabout technological education at the Universities.The announcements made in 1953 and 1954 exhaustthe possibilities of development during the presentquinquennium;   and it will not be until fairly late inthe present year that we shall have any clear idea ofthe intentions of the Universities for the 1957-62quinquennium.     This is a pity, since it detracts fromthe positive and forward-looking tone of the rest ofthe White Paper^(b) The paragraphs on the Universities are purely descriptiveof what is already being done, and contain no justifica-tion of the Governments policy in this respect.    In-ther words, they do not present, even implicitly, the counter-argument to the thesi j which Lord Cherwellelaborates in the note which the Prime Minister includedin C. P. (56) 1.    It is arguable whether we should leavethese paragraphs as they are, or whether we shouldinject into them something of the reasoning which hasled the Government to believe that, on balance, theirown approach to this problem is preferable to that ofLord CherwelL    It may help my colleagues, in decidingthis question, to study the attached copy of a note, whichwas prepared for the group of Ministers who draftedthe White Paper by way of commentary on Lord CherwelUsnote in C. P. (56) 1.COPY NO.3.      I suggest that these difficulties might be partially overcome, and feegeneral tone of the reference to the Universities might be improved, if theWhite Paper were amended as follows i-
(i)    Add, at the end of paragraph 1 - &quot;The purpose of this white Paper is to outline the steps which the Govern-ment propose to take in order to achieve this aim,particularly by expansion of the technical colleges.The special position of the Universities is described in Chapter II&quot;.(ii)    Substitute for the existing paragraph 48 -&quot;The Government attach the greatest importanceto the development of higher technology in the universities.     Their policy is based not on a rigiddivision between applied science and technology on theone hand and the arts and pure sciences on the other,but on the more organic conception of enlarging and improving existing institutions where science andtechnolog/ already flourish. &quot;(iii)    Add, at the end of paragraph 54 - &quot;The Government, in examining these recommendations, will have particular regard to the importance of progressively developing the facilities for technological education&quot;.R.A.B.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S. W. 1.20th February, 1956.
2 ^ iTECHNOLOGICAL UNIVEPSITIESIn his note of 28th December, 1955, Lord Cherwell says that toproduce technologists of what he calls the officer class in sufficient number;:technological universities are needed like the Massachusetts Institute of technology, Zurich, Charlottenburg and so on.    He proposes that toproduce the outline of a plan for this purpose (and also to advise on other aspects of the problem of scientific manpower) a very small high poweredCommittee should be appointed to report to the Cabinet.2.      It is stated in Lord Cherwell&apos;s memorandum that the Cabinet decide.&apos;more than three years ago that technological universities should be set up.This is not the case.     The University Grants Committee (U0G,C.) had-beerasked to advise &quot;how best rapidly to build up at least one institution of university rank devoted predominantly to the teaching and study of technology&quot;.     The Committee were told that &quot;in the Governments view itmay well be that the best way of achieving this is to concentrate our energi.-.upon the Imperial CoUege of Science and Technology&quot;; but they were askednot &quot;to overlook the position of the Royal Technical College, Glasgow &quot;.3.      The Committee, reporting on this reference in July, 1952, agreed with the view that it would be best to concentrate upon the expansion ofImperial College.     They referred in their report to the other twotechnological institutions on their grant list, the Royal Technical College,Glasgow, and the Manchester College of Technology, in which studentswork for degrees of the Universities of Glasgow and Manchesterrespectively;   and they gave reasons for giving a higher priority to theexpansion of Imperial College than to that of these other two institutions.4.      After discussion between Ministers, the Government accepted therecommendation to expand Imperial College and asked the U.G.C, toadvise on further developments in other parts of the country.    Acting onthat Committee&apos;s advise, the Government undertook the programme ofdevelopment announced in Parliament on 7th December, 1954.     this programme provided, in addition to the expansion of Imperial College, for major developments at Glasgow, Manchester,  Leeds and Birmingham, forother developments on a fairly large scale at Cambridge and Sheffield,ard specialised developments in a number of other Universities.     the developments in Glasgow and Manchester include developments both in the universities of each city and in the colleges mentioned in paragraph 3.Tbe capital cost of the Imperial College project over a period of ten years or more may well be of the order of  15 millions.     The capital expenditureauthorised on technological works at other Universities (outside the normalUniversity building programme) is about  5 millions.    Some of this work has been put in hand and the rest is to be begun during the period ending march, 1957.     The plans approved provided for an increase of under-graduate numbers by about 2, 000 and of pos  -graduate numbers by about1,100.     These figures include the Imperial College expansion (937 under-graduates and 713 post-graduates), a long-term project which will takelonger than the present quinquennium to realise.     The balance (about1,000 under-graduates and 300-400 post-graduates) depends mainly on a programme of development which is being undertaken within thisquinquennium.    A further programme is to be prepared.     The actualnumbers of full-time technology students in University institutions rose
from 9, 789 in October, 1953, to 11, 248 in October, 1955, an increase of abov15 per cent.    The numbers of students of pure science rose in the sameperiod from 16, 526 to 17, 765, an increase of l\ per cent.5.      There is no difference of view between Lord Cherwell and anyone else of standing on the urgency of the need for more University-trainedtechnologists.     The difference of view is about the nature of the Universityin which they should be trained.6.      Lord Cherwell appeals to the example of foreign countries.    It istrue that in most European countries the training of technologists of the class which we train in Universities had been undertaken in Technical HighSchools separate from the Universities.- No one would deny ihat a numberof these institutions have a high and well-deserved reputation, butLord Cherwell&apos;s argument involves the assumption that they owe theirsuccess to their separation from other fields of University study.     There isno evidence for this assumption, and the example of America is against it.No country has equalled the technological success of America, but in thatcountry the great bulk of University-trained technologists come from multi-faculty Universities and not from specialised institutes.      The famousMassachusetts Institute of Technology was never typical of that country, and indeed now itself includes a Faculty of Arts.7.      What exactly is a &quot;technological University1&apos;?    Several of the EnglisiUniversities - Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and King&apos;s College, Newcastlehave developed from colleges founded to teach science and its industrialapplications.    They have come, by a natural process of growth oramalgamation with other institutions, to cover the whole range of Universitystudy, though the arts remain in a minority of one-third to a quarter, andthis proportion is tending to fall.    All the various branches of technologymentioned in Lord CherwellJs paragraph 7 are to be found in one or more ofthem, and are being vigorously developed there.     The expression &quot;technological -logical University     however, as used in this controversy, has had a narrowmeaning;  it has meant a University wholly devoted to science and itsindustrial applications, other subjects being excluded.     Thus Lord Cherwellhimself, about three years ago, was speaking of an institution which wouldcontain the necessary backing of non-technological subjects, but would not go so far as to teach arts.    He seems, however, to have departed somewha...from this view,  since he now asks for technological Universities in which &quot;tbemphasis is or: the various forms of applied science, without of courseneglecting ancillary subjects such as economics, law and language&quot;.Lord Cherwell overlooks the point that a University in which arts were presc-only as ancillary subjects might have some difficulty in attracting teachers osatisfactory standard.    It can be argued that, if he wants his technologists t-learn their economics, law and languages from teachers of the highestcalibre - and he would surely wish this - then he must allow these subjectsinto his University on a footing which will attract them.    For this purposehis teachers of economics, law and languages would have to be allowed someHonours students in their own subjects, and opportunities for original work.But a University which admitted the arts on this basis would not differ from the Universities mentioned above.8.      The shift in Lord Cherwell&apos;s position perhaps makes it unnecessary to argue in detail the case for broadening the education of technologistsrather than narrowing it, and maintaining contact between them and men whoare being educated in other disciplineb for positions of responsibility inother walks of life, rather than segregating them in Universities of specialtype.    Suffice it to say that the policy of the U. G. C, is being directed to increasing such contact, which they regard as insufficient in someinstitutions.
9.     It may be that what Lord Cherwell wants is a new institution,modelled more closely on continental examples than anything now existinghere.    A new institution for teaching technology at University level on alarge scale would involve certain practical difficulties.    The first is thequestion of location.    Any such institution should be in a major industrialcentre if its departments are to maintain the necessary contact with industry.  1 But all the major industrial centres already contain Universities,whose technological departments should be developed, rather thanduplicated.    More important is the question of &quot;time.    It would take atleast ten years, as Lord Cherwell has himself admitted, from the time whe:the planning of a new technological University started urti.1 it began to turnout any graduates.    During a considerable part of this time the planning&apos;;eam, who would have to be experts of the first quality, would be virtuallyout of production so far as the current output of technologists was concernedMuch better progress is possible by building on existing foundations.10.    Pressure for special measures such as the foundation of technologic.?.Univerfities is due to the idea that established Universities are not sufficiently alive to the country fn need for more scientists and technologistsNothing could be further from the truth.     The number of scientists andtechnologists which the Universities can turn out has been limited not bytheir own volition but by causes outside their own control,  such as the limited number of qualified applicants for admission and the limitations ontheir buildings and equipment.    The number of acceptable students isnow increasing and, provided that the necessary new buildings and equipmenare made available, there is no reason to think that the Universities willnot be ready to train all the qualified applicants that come forward.11.     Lord Cherwell proposes the appointment of a high-powered Committtto report to the Government on the problems with which his memorandumdeals.    He draws an analogy with the Committee under Lord Waverleyv/hose recommendations resulted in the establishment of the Atomic energy authority.     There is, however, no true analogy between the two cases.Lord Waverley&apos;s Committee was set up to deal with a new and relativelynarrow problem which did not fall within the province of any other body.The questions now raised by Lord Cherwell fall within the purview of two existing advisory bodies appointed by the Government - the U. G. C. assisted by their Technology Sub-Ccmmittee so far as regards University education,and the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy for more general issues,The shortage o.&quot; scientific manpower is no new problem.    It has beenunder discussion for a long time and it is unlikely that any new ideas orarguments will be forthcoming.    In particular the question of technologicalUniversities was exhaustively considered when Lord Cherwell was amember of the Cabinet.    In advising on the expansion of Imperial Collegein 1952 (see paragraph 2) the U.G.C. reported against the creation of anew institution, and against the isolation of science and technology in aseparate University.     (imperial College is one of the Colleges of theUniversity of London and participates in the arrangements for inter-collegiate teaching in that University. )    Again, in their later report on thedevelopment of higher technological education outside London, the Committerecommended that the development should be based on existing institutions,either Universities or colleges affiliated to Universities.    In considering these reports the views of Lord Cherwell were fully considered, but thepolicy adopted was that recommended by the Committee, and developmentsbased on that policy are now in progress.     There would be no point insetting up a new Committee unless a reversal of this policy were contemplated.    What is needed is to press on with the developments already sanctioned and work out further developments on the lines already agreed,
without, reviving a controversy which delayed action while it lasted and isgenerally now believed to have been buried.     The setting up of a new committee would cause widespread comment and much perturbation.     Itwould be regarded as implying a reversal of policy and a withdrawal ofconfidence not only from those on whose advice; the policy now in operation was adopted, but also from the Universities which have been entrusted with the task of fulfilling that policy.
