(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(56) 1921st January, 1956CABINETPENSIONS (INCREASE) bill note by the Lord chancellor attach the report of a Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committeewhich was&apos; set up by the Lord President under my Chairmanship to consider proposals for increases in the pensions of retired public servants.     TheCabinet will recall that we have undertaken to introduce early legislation onthis subject (CM. (55) 41st Conclusions, Minute 9).2. The Sub-Committee have asked me to circulate this report to theCabinet because it raises important political issues which require early consideration.K.House of Lords, S.W.1.20th January, 1956.COPY NO.     1
HOME AFFAIRS committee report OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON FENSIONS INCREASEThe proposals summarised in paragraphs 4 to 8 of this report are within the framework of the scheme for the pensions increase whichwas considered by the Cabinet last July (CoM0(55) 25th Conclusions,Minute 9).    The proposals for the civilian public services would be thesubject of a Bill;   the Armed Forces would be dealt with separately byprerogative instruments, but the same principles, allowing fordifferences in the structure of the respective pensions systems, wouldbroadly apply to both.2.        We submit this report on these proposals as a matter of urgency, since there are important political implications which require immediate consideration if, in accordance with the FinancialSecretary&apos;s announcement on 17th November and the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech at Bradford on 10th January, the proposals are to be put beforeFarliament shortly.     The difficulties arise in connection with reper-cussions in fee Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance field andwith the views expressed by a Sub-Committee of the 1922 Committeeabout the way in which public service pensions ought to be increased.3o        The pressure for an increase in public service pensions hasbeen widespread and is mounting;  moreover, it has come to an increasing extent from those with the larger pensions who retired sometime ago andhave had little or no help so far because either their pensions or other means were too high.    Our colleagues will be familiar v/ith the pressureexerted by the Officers Pension Society, but similar views are held, though they are less forcibly expressed, by retired members of the civilianpublic services.The Main Features of the proposals,        Hitherto pensions increases have been confined to the smallerpensions so that no benefit has been received by people who had a pension of more than  550 and private means of more than about  100 a year.(Civil servants and Forces officers who had. been hit by the stabilisation of pensions in 193 5 received some improvements in 1954, but that is aseparate issue which does not concern us here).     These limitations accord with the fairly strict definitions of hardship applied by successive Govern-ments in the past (both Labour and Conservative) in applying the policy that increases could only be extended to those who had suffered most seriously from the rise in the cost of living,5.        If anything is to be done for those with the higher pensions, thishardship criterion has to be modified.     It is proposed to do so byamending the existing Acts to get rid of the means test (i, e. , the limits of total income beyond which no help is given), to eliminate therestrictions on increases by reason of the size of pension, and eliminate the difference of treatment between pensioners with and without dependants.Also, a further increase of between 6 per cent and 10 per cent accordingto the length of service, up to a maximum varying between  60 and  100,would be given in recognition of the rise in the cost of living since 1952.The removal of the means test would be popular and fee proposals as awhole would go a long way to meet the claims of the various bodies
mrepresenting public service pensioners.    The broad effects of theseproposals on examples of retired public servants formerly in the CivilService or the Armed Forces are shown in Annexes I and II.6.        The total cost of these proposals would be about  10/ll millions a year (of which about  8 millions would fall on the Excheuqer), comparedwith the  14/15 millions already given under all the previous Pensions(Increase) Acts and the  20/25 millions which would be involved in theproposals of the 1922 Sub-Committee presided over by Sir Lionel Healdwhich we discuss in paragraphs 11-13.    Further details are shown in annex III.7.        We shall certainly be criticised for appearing to give more helpwhere it is least needed and least where it is most needed.    The answer is that those getting most additional help now have had to wait a long timefor it.    The others have already had it and in fact in many cases the pastincreases are so great that there is little or no room to give more without giving older pensioners bigger pensions than those now current.0.        We consider that the proposals - which are agreed between all the Departments affected - strike a reasonable balance between theclaims of retired public servants, to whom the State has a responsibilityas employer, and the other responsibilities of the State as tax gathererwith an obligation to underwrite much of the social service expenditure.But before these proposals can be finally approved there are two important matters which must be considered.Social Service Payments9.        The Minister of Pensions, while agreeing that these proposals are desirable in themselves, was concerned about the position which would arise if at about the same time as these general and novel increases weregiven to public service pensioners the Government were, on grounds of economy, resisting pressure for action on certain measures to helppeople who might generally be considered to be in greater hardship thanretired senior, public servants.     The measures he had specially in mindare concerned with family allowances, old workmen&apos;s compensationcases, widows and the earnings rule for retirement pensions.    He wasalso concerned about the repercussions on claims by the Dritish Legionand the British Limbless Ex Service Men&apos;s Association for war pensioners.A short note on each is attached as Annex IV to this paper.10.       The Minister told us that he thought the position could be (maintained on each of these if he could be assured that proposals forthese classes could be considered on their merits and would not be subjectto an absolute bar on financial grounds, and could be considered for inclusion in the Parliamentary timetable if Ministers approved changes.11.      It is not for us to attempt to strike a balance between the variousclaims upon the national finances or upon the Parliamentary timetable.But we consider, and the Minister agrees, that, provided the proposalswhich are in his mind could be considered on their merits at the time,it would be reasonable for the pensions increase proposals to go forward.The 1922 Sub-Committee12.      Here we are in something of a dilemma.    On the one hand we havegenerous proposals which would go a long way to meeting the claims of thepublic service pensioners, are as much as-can be afforded, and would
certainly bring the Government considerable credit amongst those concerned, particularly by abolishing the means test feature.    On theother hand we have the proposal put forward by the 1922 Sub-committee presided over by Sir Lionel Heald, that all public service pensions shouldbe put up to current rates.    We are agreed that this proposal cannot be entertained for the following reasons   -(i) It is not practicable because the principle cannotbe applied.    Changes that have taken place in thegreat public services in the past twenty or thirty years make comparisons in many cases betweenold and new pensioners totally impossible.    Somejobs have disappeared altogether;   some public servants,  e.g., many in local government had nopensions at all until quite recently;   and others have changed their content so much as a result of reorganisation that it would be impossible to say with whom a man retiring in 193 9 ought to be compared.Some pensioners, even, receive payment in respectof service too short to qualify for a pension today andthus on the Heald principle would get nothing.    In fact,the object of a pensions increase measure, namely, todetermine precisely what new rate of pension each individual shall have, is impossible to achieve on this principle.    Unfortunately the 1922 Sub-Committee didnot dig deeply enough into the subject to discover thisalthough it is one of the basic facts which have to be faced.(ii) It would be too costly.     The cost would be of the order of 20-25 millions, an increase of 20 per cent-25 per centon the present total cost of public service pensions andmore than double the total cost of the scheme which wehave examined.    Apart from the direct cost, the grantof an increase of this size would certainly provokerepevcussipns elsewhere.13.       The proposals of the 1922 Sub-Committee have been consideredby the Executive but have not been put before the full Committee which,having been put off twice, expects to hear about the Sub-Committee^Report very soon,    If this Report were to be circulated to all membersof the 1922 Committee there would almost certainly be a leak to thePress.    We should then find ourselves in a most unfortunate position,since it would become known to the public service pensioners1representative bodies that a significant number of back bencherssupported their claim to have all public service pensions raised to current rates.    Cur own generous proposals would then get off to a badstart, and the Government would get no credit for them.    It is, therefore,vital to avoid this situation.14.      We have considered various means by which this can be avoided and we have come to the conclusion that there is only one wayof doing so - to make an announcement of the Government^ proposals in outline very soon after the House reassembles and, immediatelyafterwards, to explain the proposals to the 1922 Committee.     This wouldmean making the announcement on 26th January in answer to a pre-arranged question, and explaining the matter to the 1922 Committee at its regular meeting at 6 o&apos; clock that evening.
This may well raise difficulties with the 1922 Committee.    Inthe first place it would be said that the usual consultations have not takenplace on the Governments proposals.    More forcibly it may be said thatthe Government have committed themselves without waiting to hear theviews ox the 1922 Committee on the proposals of its own Sub-Committee.But on balance we feel that these dangers are less than those in paragraph 13,Conclusions15.      We recommend that the proposals summarised in paragraphs 4 to0 should be endorsed;  that consideration be given to the matters raisedby the Minister o  Pensions;   and that an announcement should be made inthe House next Thursday, 26th January.19th January, 1956

ANNEX IVSOCIAL SERVICE PAYMENTS(a) Family AllowancesThese were referred to in the Queen&apos;s Speech and the proposal Isthat they should be extended to children up to the age of eighteen while at school or undergoing full-time training.    The immediate cost would be 2^- millions a year, of which  2 millions would be borne by the theExchequer and  g- million on National Insurance funds.    There would be some increase in the National Insurance outgoings as time went on.(b) Workmen&apos; s C ompensationThere was pressure to increase the old workmen&apos;s compensation payments and the Minister had, with Cabinet authority, negotiated anarrangement with the Trades Union Congress which would cost about 650,000 provided the changes were embodied in legislation in the present session.    If there were delay the Trades Union Congress&apos; agreement wouldlapse.(c) WidowsThere was a complicated seried of proposals arising fromrecommendations of the National Insurance Advisory Committee.    These hadnot been considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer but the net costof the Minister&apos;s proposals would be S2.\ millions immediately:    the actual expenditure from the National Insurance funds would be  3^ millions butthere would be a saving on assistance of  1 million.    This did not take account of any repercussions on the &quot;10/- widows&quot;.(d) The Earnings RuleThis rule lays down that those in receipt of national insurance retirement pensions may not earn more than  2 without suffering areduction of their pension.    The rule is now being examined by theNational Insurance Advisory Committee and their report is expected inthe early summer    Any substantial change in the limit would be costly,e. g. , if the limit were raised from  2 to  3 a week the cost might on present estimates approach  2 millions a year.    This change would require legislation.
