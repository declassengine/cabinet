secret.P.(56) 38 COPY NO.  a jb14th February, 1956CABINETSALE OF AIRCRAFT AND AN AIRCRAFT CARRIERTO ARGENTINAMemorandum by the Se cretary of State for Foreign AJfairsThe Argentine Air Force are showing a keen interest in acquiringShackleton and Canberra aircraft, and the manufacturers are anxious toknow whether they will be allowed to deliver if they can secure the orders.It has in recent years been our policy to refuse to supply Argentina with aircraft capable of being used against us in the Falkland Islands or falkland islands Dependencies, but to allow the sale of small aircraft which couldnot harm us.     Thus in 1954 we were ready to supply helicopters for cropspraying and in 1955 Sea Furies for the Navy, but not larger navalhelicopters or Shackletons.    We have also discouraged approaches aboutthe purchase of an aircraft carrier.     The position has now changed bothin Argentina and in the Antarctic, and I think that it is time to reconsiderour attitude,Supporting arguments2,      It is true that both Shackleton and Canberra aircraft might be useful to Argentina in the Antarctic, and that Canberras could also in theory beemployed offensively against the Falkland Islands.    By allowing the saleof such aircraft we could thus help Argentina to further her claims andillegal trespass upon our territory.     This could be considered inconsistent with our proclaimed policy of maintaining our position in the Antarctic,and might be criticised in Parliament and elsewhere.3.      On the other hand the following factors must be borne in mind:-(i)     Since the fall of Feron we have a more friendly regime in Argentina,which, while maintaining its Antarctic claims, is behaving less aggressivelyabout them and shows signs of wishing for an eventual accommodation with us,    No fresh Argentine bases are being established this season in the antarctic.(ii) Whereas in 1954 we still contemplated the forcible eviction of the argentines from our Sector, we have now abandoned this idea and havetacitly accepted that they have come to stay (although we still hope toreduce the extent of their encroachment).(iii) If we refuse to allow the order, or take too long to make up ourmind, the Argentine Air Force will almost certainly obtain equally suitableaircraft from the United States, who are eager to supply them.
(iv)    It is important to encourage Argentine interest in Shackletons andCanberras, if we wish to maintain our position in the market.    economic difficulties may prevent the placing of a large order straight away;   butfuture orders are likely to follow the first and, if British manufacturerscannot compete now, we must expect the Argentine Air Force, which isnow predominantly British equipped, to go increasingly American.4.     In all the circumstances I doubt whether political or strategic considerations any longer justify us in foregoing the long-term economicgain which we can expect to achieve by securing these orders for Britishindustry.    I therefore favour a lifting of the ban so far as Canberras andShackletons are concerned.    Some of the same considerations apply withregard to the sale of an aircraft carrier, in which the Argentine Navycontinues to show interest;   but there is not the same urgency here, sincethe Americans are not at present competing and it is unlikely that theNavy can yet undertake such a large financial commitment.    It seemsbest to postpone a decision about the aircraft carrier until after theforthcoming Antarctic talks with the State Department and interestedCommonwealth Governments in Washington, which should help to clarifythe general position.conclusions.      I invite my colleagues to agree to the following:-(i)     Messrs. A. V. Roe and the English Electric Company should beallowed to seek orders from the Argentine Air Force for Shackletonand Canberra aircraft and should be told that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill place no obstacle in the way of delivery.(ii) The position as regards the sale of an aircraft carrier to;Argentinashould be reconsidered after the Antarctic talks in-Washington.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1956.
