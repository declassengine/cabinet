o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (56) 33 COPY NO. 4 411th February, 1956CABINETNEWSPRINTMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 23rd January, the Cabinet invited me to discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer the newspapers&apos; request that we should continueGovernment control over the distribution of newsprint (C. M. (56) 5thConclusions, Minute 3).2.        I have now discussed this with the Chancellor and we are agreedthat, since there seems no possibility of persuading the newspapers toadopt a voluntary control for newspaper consumption, we should go ahead with the scheme for rationing newspapers until the end of this year whichI put forward in paragraph 7(iii) of C. P. (56) 15.    We are also agreed thatan announcement of the continued control should be made as soon as possible.3.        A Question on newsprint controls is already down for answer on tuesday, 14th February.    I think we must announce our policy then or therewill be a good deal of undesirable speculation in the newspapers.    I proposeto do so in the following terms:-&quot;At my request the newspapers have been considering whether the present statutory control might be replaced by voluntary control.     They have, however, recently informed me that they are unable to agree upon any basis which wouldenable such a voluntary scheme to be achieved, or for safe-guards to be provided for the small user.     They have all with one exception asked that statutory control should be continued for the time being.&quot;In such circumstances I have decided that the necessary order should be laid before Parliament.&quot;I am, however, taking the opportunity to license anincreased number of pages for &quot;The Times&quot;.    I am doing this because this newspaper now intends to use exclusively a typeof paper other than newsprint, and will release to other news-papers all the newsprint it would otherwise have used. &quot;P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.10th February, 1956.
