Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1956SECRET Copy No.  51CP. (56) 55th January, 1956CABINETREDISTRIBUTIOP-1 OF seats memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and theSecretary of State for scotland the Cabinet authorised us on 22nd September to inform the Speaker of theGovernments intention to introduce lesislation to amend the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, (CM. (55) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 3).2. This we have done, and we have now received from the Speaker a letteragreeing with the proposed amendments, but asking that he should be relieved ofthe chairmanship of the Boundary Commissions. A copy of the Speakers letter isattached (Annex A).3. Under Part I of the First Schedule to the Act of 1949 the Speaker isChairman ex officio of each of the four Commissions. The English Commissionconsists in addition of the Registrar General, the Director-General of OrdnanceSurvey and two other members, one appointed by the Secretary of State and theother by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The Scottish, Welsh andNorthern Irish Commissions are similarly constituted. In each case one of theappointed members is nominated by the Speaker as Deputy Chairman.4. We are satisfied that there is no adequate substitute for the Speaker as chairman of the Commissions, and in particular, that his suggestion that he shouldbe replaced by a revising committee of Members of Parliament is not satisfactory.We think therefore that the Speaker should be pressed to reconsider the matter, andwe propose to write to him in the terms of the attached draft (Annex B). We shouldbe glad to have the authority of the Cabinet for doing so.G. LL.-G.J. S.4th January. 1956.ANNEX ALetter from the Speaker to the Home SecretaryDear Home Secretary, 8th December, 1955.I have considered the attached memorandum on the Redistribution of Seats,which was kindly forwarded to me by your office. I think that the suggestedamendments to the Statute would remove most of the difficulties which weredisclosed in the debates on the Commission^ last Report.It is quite clear that the inclusion of the Speaker as Chairman of theCommission has not removed the Reports from the field of Parliamentary criticism and therefore difficulties might arise in debate which might do harm to the authorityof the Chair. Further, Members have access to me, and it might be difficult to convince other candidates that sitting Members would derive no advantage fromthis privilege. 1 must, therefore, ask for an amendment to be included in your proposals which will sever the Speakers connection with the Commission.49368
With the removal of the Speaker as Chairman, the Commission would then become a Commission of officials, which is, in my opinion, the ideal body for factfinding and for carrying out the routine adjustments necessitated by localgovernment boundary changes. However, when it comes to the periodical reviewsomething more is required, and I would suggest that the Commission^ report should stand referred to a Statutory Committee consisting of the Speaker as chairman and four other Members of the House of Commons to be elected by theHouse at the beginning of each Parliament. This body would consider theCommission^ Report and make their report on it to the Home Secretary, whowould be obliged to lay the Commission^ Report and the Statutory Committee&apos;sReport on the Table before or when tabling his own proposals.The advantage of this two-tiered procedure is that the Boundary commission would find the facts and make their recommendations strictly in accordance withthose facts. It would be for the Statutory Committee to consider what variations in the Report, common sense, the convenience of electors and political considerations might make desirable. I do not think my chairmanship of such a body (making only unanimous Reports) would be open to the objections mentionedin my second paragraph which have already arisen under existing arrangements,and might become more acute in certain circumstances.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) W. S. MORRISON,Speaker.ANNEXBDraft Letter to the Speaker from the Home secretary the Secretary of State for Scotland and I are most grateful for your letter of8th December about the redistribution of seats. We are very glad to note that you agree that our suggested amendments would remove most of the difficulties that have arisen under the Act of 1949.2. We had previously considered your own position as Chairman of the fourBoundary Commissions, and we have now given most earnest consideration towhat you say on the subject. We have submitted the matter to the Cabinet, and this letter expresses not only our personal views but those of the Government.3. We entirely agree with your view that the existing Commissions withoutthe Speaker as Chairman would be inadequate; and I am very sorry to say thatthe suggestion which you make to fill the gap does not appear to us to be altogethersatisfactory or workable.4. We think that there would be great difficulty in constituting the proposed committee. We agree that it should be small; but there would be no room on asmall committee for representation of minority groups, and this would impair public confidence in it.5. Would Ministers be eligible to sit on the committee? Any opposition would be likely to object to this, on the ground that the committee should be asfar as possible independent of the Government. But this would give the Oppositionan advantage if they were free to put their leading men on the committee. Onthe other hand a committee composed exclusively of back-benchers would be unlikely to possess the necessary authority or experience.6. How would the proposed committee work? Would the boundary commissions&apos; reports be published before they were referred to the committee?If so, everyone would regard the committee as a court of appeal, and its members would be under great pressure from their Party colleagues in a way that wouldmake it extremely difficult for the committee to work effectively or impartially.Even if the Commissions&apos; reports were referred to the committee before publication,this difficulty would not disappear, because the local publication of the commissions&apos; provisional recommendations including the publication of revised proposals under our proposed amendments would give everyone a good idea how the wind blew.7. Your suggestion somewhat resembles a proposal that the boundary commissions should include Members of Parliament, which was considered and
rejected by the Departmental Committee on Electoral Machinery, whose report(Cmd. 6408 of 1942) provided the material on which the Speaker) Conference of1944 made the recommendations which were given effect in the originalRedistribution of Seats Act of that year. I enclose a&quot;copy of the paragraphs of theCommittee&apos;s report discussing this proposal and their recommendation that the speaker should be Chairman of the Boundary Commissions (Appendix).Experience makes it necessary to qualify some of the Committee^ arguments; butsubstantially their conclusions appear to us to stand.8. Assuming for the moment that the job could be divided between the commissions and the proposed committee in the manner you suggest, would thecommittee be bound by the same statutory rules as the Commissions? It seemsto us that they must acton the same principles, or chaos would result. In any event the committee would have to be given some statutory guidance, and we find it hard to envisage what guidance could be given other than the rules.9. Could the committee be expected to do a proper job unless it had ampletechnical assistance in considering the Commissions&apos; recommendations? Would it not have to have the full support and assistance of the Commissions and their staff?And would not the committee thus become a sort of extension of the Commissions?10. But is the suggested distinction between fact-finding and forming finaljudgments practical anyway? It seems to us that in practice the two processesmust be inseparable. Does not the suggestion that the Commissions should be confined to fact-finding greatly under-estimate their task? They already havewide discretion in many respects, calling for the exercise of high qualities of judgment, in particular by the Deputy Chairman. Our proposed amendmentswould add to the Commissions&apos; discretion, and consequently to the responsibilitiesfalling on the Deputy Chairmen.11. Does it not follow from these considerations that your suggestion inpractice would simply amount to placing in commission the Speakers existingfunction in relation to the Commissions? We think that this would be unsatisfactory, for two reasons in particular. First, the politically experiencedguidance which the Commissions require should be available to them at needthroughout all stages of their work, and should not merely be applied at the end,after the Commissions have first considered the general principles on which theyshould proceed, have then taken account of objections to their provisionalproposals, and have finally formed their own conclusions. Secondly, the guidanceof a committee could not be as freely sought or given as that of an individual: acommittee which could do nothing unless it were unanimous (we agree that thiswould be an essential condition) would be no substitute for the wise personalguidance which the Speaker alone could give.12. An underlying principle of the present Act is that the working out indetail of a scheme of redistribution is not a job for politicians, but for a completelyindependent and impartial body of high standing, whose recommendations shouldbe submitted as a whole to Parliament to accept or reject. To introduce at some stage revision by a committee of politicians would be contrary to this principle andwould, we think, be a step backwards. Moreover it would inevitably lower thestanding and authority of the Commissions. This would be entirely contrary tothe intention of our proposed amendments and would be in every way unfortunate.13. The Boundary Commissions, and their Deputy Chairmen in particular,undoubtedly need experienced political guidance, and our conclusion is that for thispurpose no individual or committee could replace the Speaker. We do not ovelook the embarrassment which you felt during the debates last winter, and we cannot expect that the Boundary Commissions&apos; proposals will never again be controversial.But we think it is reasonable to expect that the controversy will not again assume the bitter Party character that it had last winter. This was due to the whollyexceptional fact that in 1948 changes were made to the recommendations of theEnglish Commission which were inconsistent with the statutory rules, and the rulesthemselves were not amended, with the result that in 1954 the Commission had to reverse some of those changes to conform with the rules, and this had to be done under a Government of a different complexion.14. We do not believe that the authority of the Chair was even temporarilydamaged as a result of last winter&apos;s controversy; and we see no reason to fear thatit might suffer appreciable harm on another occasion.
appendix extract from Report of the Committee on Electoral MachineryDecember, 1942101. Such a Commission would, however, be incomplete and ineffective, inour opinion, unless its membership comprised an element securing contact withthe Legislature and authoritative experience of the Parliamentary system. Theactual proposals of the Commission would require to be guided by such contactand experience. Further, its proposals, however sound, would need to carry withthem, when presented to Parliament, the weight implied by their preparation under such guidance and control. Otherwise we have no doubt that proposals reachingParliament would necessarily be subjected to debate, criticism and amendment indetail, and the main objective of removing the subject of redistribution from thepolitical arena would be defeated.102. We have considered very fully the form in which this element might beprovided, including the possibility that the Commission might comprise Membersof Parliament appointed or nominated from time to time to represent the principalpolitical Parties. Apart from the difficulty (inter alia) of maintaining fair balanceof political opinion, we believe that such political members would find it impossibleto divest themselves of their Party allegiance in regard to any features of redistribution proposals which affected Party interests. The result would inevitably be, as we see the matter, the occurrence of frequent deadlocks, or of majoritydecisions which would go far to deprive the Commission^ recommendations ofany inherent validity or authority.103. We are accordingly convinced that the Parliamentary element must be ofa non-Party character. This has led us inevitably to the Speaker of the House ofCommons ex officio, whose great experience and authoritative non-Party statuswould render him as Chairman the ideal source of guidance and control over theCommission^ recommendations. We have the example before us of the lateSpeakers chairmanship of the Boundary Commissions of 1917; and we have notedthe acceptance by Parliament of the Reports of those Commissions in view of the assurance attached to them, not only of their complete impartiality, but also thatno considerations of Parliamentary importance had been disregarded. We suggest,moreover, that the function of maintaining the equal representative status ofMembers of the House of Commons approaches so nearly to a vital domestic concern of the House itself that there is special propriety in placing the machineryof a permanent Commission under the presiding genius of the Speaker.104. We appreciate the heavy burdens already sustained by a Speaker of theHouse of Commons; but it would seem unnecessary that he should occupy the chair of the Commission except on special occasions or when in his opinion thebusiness to be transacted required this course. We think that the parent Actshould designate one of the departmental members as Vice-Chairman of theCommission and that the Vice-Chairman should preside at any meetings of theCommission convened to deal with purely administrative matters, prior to thestages at which conclusions could be reached and proposals adopted by a session orsessions presided over by the Chairman.15. The effective functioning of the machinery of redistribution, through the agency of impartial Commissions of the highest possible standing, is a matter ofgreat importance, and the Governments considered view is reluctant though weare to press it on you that the Speaker can make a unique contribution to it.We feel compelled, therefore, to ask you to consider the matter again in the lightof the arguments set out above; and we very much hope that you will feel ableto agree that the present constitution of the Commissions should not be altered.
