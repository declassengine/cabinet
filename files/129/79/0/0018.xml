BfflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET BVB?fl C.P. (56) 13 COPY NO. ^ VBJB                  ZOth January, 1956 \mmmm\BJB                                                                 CABINET B-VJCYPRUS: ATHENS RADIO BROADCASTSBU                            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs HBVJBB1                                        and the Secretary of State for the Colonies hBH?Bb    I Athens Radio, an official organ of the Greek Government, stillHftfl continues the intolerable subversion, and incitements to violence, in itsdaily broadcasts to Cyprus, that have now gone on for many months. BBVJRepeated diplomatic protests to the Greek Government during the last year IBVHBb                and more have elicited professions of regret and promises of improvement. ^^^^HHfl                Although control over Athens Radio is the official responsibility of the HBVJHHfl                Prime Minister&apos;s Office, almost nothing has been done to meet our protests. BBBJHBfl                Possibly the worst broadcast of all, accusing Her Majesty&apos;s Government of ^^^^arranging the murder of the Turkish policeman, occurred on 12th January. ^^^hThe Greek Foreign Minister has told H. M. Ambassador that he is unable ^^^HHBfl                to take a strong line about Athens Radio for fear of being called a quisling. ^^^^2. The Cabinet considered last July whether to jam these broadcasts;?flVJ               but came to the conclusion that this would be inexpedient.    It was thought ^^^^preferable to develop counter-propaganda from the Cyprus broadcasting ^^^^BAVJ               station (C. M. (55) 27th Conclusions, Minute 1). ^^^B3. Sir John Harding, the Governor of Cyprus, recognises the objections BBB1BAV               to jamming a foreign station.    But on 23rd December, in his review of HBVJmeasures that he considered would be necessary in Cyprus, he stated:- ^^^HHBh                                  &quot;Athens Radio is a powerful instrument through which the ^^^HGreek Government aims to intervene in the internal situation BBVJin Cyprus in favour of Enosis.    I had hoped that the Greek ^^^BHBb                            Government could be persuaded to change their policy in this ^^^HHBV                            respect and that the evil effects of Athens Radio might to BBVJsome extent be counteracted by counter propaganda here and ????HAV                           from London.    Those hopes have proved illusory; but what BBVJis even more important from the point of view of the security BBVJcampaign is that recent information, admittedly as yet BVftWjHBb                           uncorroborated, indicates that Athens Radio is being used ^^^HHBb                           by EOKA as a medium for passing operational messages in ^^^HHBb                           code.    This has finally decided me that the time has now ^^^HW3MM                           come when Athens Radio must be jammed in the interests BflYBBAVj                          of the security campaign.    I realise that other considerations, ^^^Hboth political and technical, are involved, but I most strongly ^^^HBAVJ                          urge that any disadvantages there may be should be accepted. BVflBBAB 1                        1 would be grateful if this matter could be examined as a ^^^B^^B   I ?                  matter of urgency and if I could have your authority to jam ^^^HHftWj                          Athens Radio as soon as I am in a position to do so.    On BflVBwMMM I                       that point I should be glad if the equipment I have asked for ^^^Hcould be despatched by fastest possible means. &quot; ^^^B?fl ????
4. We have reached the view that, provided these Athens broadcasts b^Hcontinue, the Governor should be given the authority he asks for. Suchaction could follow as soon as technically practicable, in the event of a ?TgHbreakdown of the discussions with&apos;Archbishop Makarios or if, in spite ofagreement with him, hostile broadcasts continue. ErgH5. We fully realise that there are strong arguments against resortingto this form of counter-attack, for example:-I (a)   Jamming of enemy broadcasts was never resorted toLV-Vfl during the war since it would have been regardedas interference with freedom of speech. LtbH(b)   In the United Nations, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have g^Hsupported resolutions condemning jamming. f rflI (c)   In 1952, Her Majesty&apos;s Government wrote to the Secretary- ?TgHGeneral of the United Nations saying inter-alia - &quot;nocountry can pretend freedom of information ..., whenit maintains the deliberate jamming of foreign broad-(d)   At the Geneva Conference the Western Governments   , fgyflLVAVfl put forward proposals which contained the following -&quot;the systematic jamming of broadcasts of news andinformation is a regrettable practice.    It isLVgVfl incompatible with the directive of the Four Heads of? Government and should cease&quot;.LVaVaV                 6.        The following representations have been received semi-officially ?TaTaVfrom Sir Ian Jacob, the Director-General of the British Broadcasting r rflLVaVaVJ             Corporation, who is aware that the possibility of jamming the Greek broad- Lf-Hcasts was recently under discussion:-&quot;I do not know whether you have given any further thoughtto this proposal, but in case you have I should like to emphasiseto you the importance that in our view attaches to the questionof jamming.    At no time since international broadcastingstarted have we, the British, ever resorted to jamming of ourI opponents&apos; transmissions.    It has always been held thatjamming is a policy which goes against the traditions we are ?T t tJseeking to uphold and is therefore unjustifiable even at times LVgVflof grave stress.    You may recall that shortly before the warwe were much troubled in the Middle East by Italian broad-casts from Bari which were of the most mischievous kind. FgVgSLVaVaVJ Our answer to them was not to seek to jam them; it was to ?TbTbtJstart the B.B.C&apos;s Arabic Service.    Other examples couldbe quoted.... &quot;I might add that as far as we know the only so-called member of the free world who resorts to jamming atthe present time is the Chinese Government in Formosa. &quot;l&quot;f        7.       Apart from the internal security aspect in Cyprus on which the case PaVaHfor jamming is overwhelming, the following arguments may be held tocounter those in paragraph 5(a) and (d) above:-
(a) Besides the Chinese precedent mentioned by MmMSir Ian Jacob, the French Government at present ^mWMUmW,                                        jam broadcasts inciting to armed revolt in theirAfrican territories.    This is not donemwM indiscriminately and only subversive broadcasts WMMI are jammed. ^^M(b) In doing so they rely mainly on the provisions of the WmMLeague of Nations International Convention on the ^mw\mWM XJse of Broadcasting of 1936.    The signatories of ^mWttliis Convention (including the United Kingdom and MwMGreece, although the latter did not ratify) under- ^mwJtook to stop without delay broadcasts which were mmummmt                                          &quot;to the detriment of good international under-standing&quot; and which &quot;incite the population of any ^mwtterritory to acts incompatible with the internal mwMorder or the security of a territory of a High WMM^MM\ Contracting Party&quot;. WmUMMM (c)   There are a number of United Nations resolutions ^MM^MM\ condemning propaganda designed or likely to ^MMencourage violence.(d)   The defensive jamming by the French Government isnot considered to be in conflict with the Three Powerproposals referred to in paragraph 5(d) above.8. If we decide to jam, the Greeks might appeal to the United Nationsbnt, in view of the character of their broadcasts, they might well think thiswould be imprudent.    They could jam B.B.C. broadcasts to Greece, butthis would not be a serious political handicap to us.    They might themselvesbe able to jam broadcasts from the Cyprus station and, if they could, thismight be more serious.9. On balance, we feel no doubt that, to carry out our responsibilitiesin Cyprus, we ought to give the Governor the authority to deal with AthensRadio as he proposes, if these broadcasts continue.    When protests fail,this direct action against subversive broadcasts is the only effective counter.A foreign power cannot be allowed to incite Her Majesty&apos;s subjects to^-tM violence and disaffection, or to attempt to intimidate Her Majesty&apos;s servants. ^^MmWM 10,      We therefore seek the agreement of our colleagues that ^mWAI     I Sir John Harding should be authorised to arrange for the discriminatejamming of Athens subversive broadcasts to Cyprus (a) if the talks with the| Archbishop break down, or (b) if, in spite of an agreement with theArchbishop, the hostile broadcasts continue.p    20th January, 1956.mmu mum
