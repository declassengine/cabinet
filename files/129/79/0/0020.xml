(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government secret.P. (56) 20 COPY NO,       ;.21st January. 1956CABINETCURRENT WAGES position memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service am circulating for the information of the Cabinet a brief summaryof the present wages position,     Tne usual more detailed analysis of move-ments in wages and hours of work will be circulated to the Economic PolicyCommittee in a few days.2,        Current wage claims involve over 7,000, 000 workers.    The mainindustries concerned ares-(a) Engineering and Shipbuilding(b) Building(c) Retail Distribution(d) Coal-mining(e) Railways(f) Cotton(g) Gas and Electricity.In agriculture, the union (though it has accepted the increase of 8s,, recentlyawarded by the Agricultural Wages Board) has given notice of a further claimto be presented at the next meeting of the Board on 1st February.3. The workers in all these industries, with the exception of cotton,received wage increases in the firsc few months of 1955 and it is by no meansunusual for them to be claiming higher wages at this time of year.    To put the current figures into proper perspective I summarise below the numbersaffected by wage increases and the estimated net weekly addition to wage rates in each of the last five years.Year Approximate number Estimated netof workpeople affected weekly increase by reported wage changes     at the end of theyear 1951 12,262, 000 6,569,6001952 11,484,000 4,455,7001953 9,031, 500 2,420,4001954 10, 147, 000 3, 500,6001955 11, 889, 500 5, 130, 7004.        It is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the total additionto the national wages bill which settlement of the current claims will entail.This is partly because many of the claims have not yet been preciselyformulated and also because, in the process of bargaining, the original
demands will undoubtedly be reduced.    It is unlikely, however, that thetotal addition to the wages bill this year, due to increased wage rates, willbe smaller than it was last year.    The recent railway settlement which hasbeen reached without the difficulties and delays experienced in recent years is bound to influence negotiations on claims in other industries.     in engineering;, the recent falling off in output in the motor car industry maydispose employers towards somewhat harder bargaining,5.        My intervention has not yet been requested in the negotiations onany of these claims and, indeed, as my colleagues   know, there is no partfor me to play unless negotiations break down between the parties.    Anyof these claims, therefore, may be settled at any time without our inter-vention or without our prior knowledge of the terms of settlement.    Si thecase of some claims, negotiations may drag on and perhaps end indisputes d60        In the Appendix, I summarise the essential information about the major current claims and recent settlements.I.
