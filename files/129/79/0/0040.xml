CONFIDENTIAL15th February, 1956.TECHNICAL EDUCATIONWhite Paper by the Minister of Education andthe Secretary of State for ScotlandDEFINITIONSMost of those who pass through the system of technical education and make their careers in manufacturing industry are divided into three categories:.technologists, technicians and craftsmen. For the purposes of this Paperthese are defined broadly as follows: TechnologistsA technologist has the qualifications and experience required for member-ship of a professional institution. Most university graduates in engineering and other applied sciences, and a good proportion of holders of HigherNational Diplomas or Certificates or similar qualifications, becometechnologists.A technologist has studied the fundamental principles of his chosen tech-nology and should be able to use his knowledge and experience to initiatepractical developments. He is expected to accept a high degree of responsi-bility and in many cases to push forward the boundaries of knowledgein his own particular field.TechniciansA technician is qualified by specialist technical education and practicaltraining to work under the general direction of a technologist. Consequently,he will require a good knowledge of mathematics and science related to hisown speciality. Examples of technicians in the factory are assistant designersand junior ranks of management on the shop floor.CraftsmenCraftsmen represent the skilled labour of manufacturing industry andaccount for more than one-third of its manpower. With the growing com-complexity of machines and the introduction of new materials it becomes all themore necessary for them to appreciate not only the how but also the why ofthe work they do.The following are the principal qualifications associated with the three categories defined above:  University DegreesA university honours degree is usually accepted for complete or. partialexemption from the examinations of professional institutions. Some colleges of technology are affiliated to universities under arrangements which enablean internal degree to be obtained after a course at the college. More widelyspread courses are held in major colleges for students intending to takeexternal degrees of London University.Technical College DiplomasCertain technical colleges award their own diplomas or associateships atthe end of courses at technological level, most of which are full-time.
National Diplomas and CertificatesNational Diplomas and Certificates are awarded jointly by the Ministry ofEducation or the Scottish Education Department and the professional institu-tions concerned.   There are two grades: Ordinary and Higher.The Ordinary National Diploma is awarded to Successful students whohave taken a full-time course for two years from a minimum age of sixteen.The Higher National Diploma is: awarded after a three years&apos; full-time coursestarting at a minimum age of eighteen. Higher National Diplomas are usually recognised for exemption from certain examinations of professionalinstitutions.The Ordinary National Certificate is obtained by successful students atthe end of a part-time course lasting three years from the age of sixteen,and the Higher National Certificate after two years&apos; further study. It is common for students who have gained the Higher National Certificate to pursue their studies to a level which provides complete exemption from theexaminations of professional institutions.Certificates of the City and Guilds of London InstituteFinal and Full Technological Certificates are awarded at the end of part-time courses of four or five years from the age of sixteen upwards. In craftsubjects they represent the highest standards of skilled craftsmanship,Intermediate Certificates are awarded on the result of examination after a twoyear course. The Institute also holds examinations at technician level. Theseare broadly scientific in scope and in certain subjects are of a standardapproximating to that required for a technologist.Certificates of Regional Examining unions in England and Wales there are four Regional Examining Unions which work in close co-operation with the City and Guilds of London Instituteand hold examinations of a similar level at the Intermediate stage and higher stages. Students then proceed to the final examination of the City andGuilds of London Institute.Other Professional and Trade CertificatesIn addition to the above qualifications awarded by examining bodies thereare many certificates awarded on examination by professional and trade organisations.introduction the Prime Minister, speaking at Bradford on 18th January, referred tothe world-wide scientific revolution. He said: &quot; The prizes will not go to thecountries with the largest population. Those with the best systems of educa-tion will win. Science and technical skill give a dozen men the power to doas much as thousands did fifty years ago. Our scientists are doing brilliantwork. But if we are to make full use of what we are learning, we shall need many more scientists, engineers and technicians. I am determined thatthis shortage shall be made good.&quot;2. The figures given later in this Paper show how greatly the Britishsystem of scientific and technical education has expanded since before thewar: Between 1938 and 1955 the number of university students in science and technology has doubled and since the Education Acts of 1944 and 1945,more schools and technical colleges have been built, more teachers havebeen recruited and more interest has been shown in education by parentsand employers than in any corresponding period in our history.
3. But this is nothing like enough. From the U.S.A., Russia and western europe comes the challenge to look to our system of technical education to see whether it bears comparison with what is being done abroad. Suchcomparisons cannot be made accurately because standards and systems Ofeducation vary so much, but it is clear enough that all these countries aremaking an immense effort to train more scientific and technical manpower and that we are in danger of being left behind. A note about recent developments in the U.S.A., Russia and Western Europe is given inAppendix A.4. But we do not need the spur of foreign examples. Our own circum-stances show clearly enough the policies which we must pursue. Our aimsare to strengthen the foundations of our economy, to improve the standards of living of our people, and to discharge effectively our manifold respon-sibilities overseas. Our success in each case will turn largely on our ability to secure a steady increase in industrial output, in productive investment,and in exports of goods and services of the highest quality at competitiveprices. One industry after another is being compelled to follow its com-petitor, supplier or customer in modernising its techniques, knowing that unless new materials are discovered and new methods applied, British industry may fall behind in the race. The pace of change is quickening, and with itboth the need and the demand for technical education.5. The demand will be no less urgent from the less developed countires overseas, whom it is our duty and our interest to help win for themselves ahigher standard of life. This can be done in two ways: there must be moreplaces in our universities and technical colleges for overseas students, andmore British experts must be available to work or teach abroad.6. We face, then, an intense and rising demand for scientific manpower andby no means only for men and women with the highest qualifications. Everytechnologist relies on technicians and craftsmen to translate his plans intoproducts. It would be a great mistake to increase the output of technologistswithout adequately supporting them at the lower levels from which in any event many of them are drawn. Much therefore depends on strengthening the base of the pyramid of technical education by improving the education in the schools and raising the numbers of school-leavers who are able and willing to take successfully the courses offered at technical colleges.7. Here the prospects are good. The romance of science is catching on as can be seen even in the toy shops. Every year parents and children aretaking a greater interest in technical education. More boys and girls arestaying on at school after the statutory leaving age ; more are taking science and more are continuing their education after school; and more are succeed-ing in the courses on which they have embarked. These are welcome signs that the base of the pyramid is growing stronger. It will also grow larger,since the age-groups from which Industry and the technical colleges are nowrecruiting are the smallest for a hundred years. Soon the figures will climbupwards. Last year the number of 18 year olds in Britain was 642,000; inten years&apos; time it will be about 850,000.8. Technical education must not be too narrowly vocational or too confined to one skill or trade. Swift change is the characteristic of our age, so thata main purpose of the technical education of the future must be to teachboys and girls to be adaptable. Versatility has been the aim of a classicaleducation ; technical studies should lead to a similar versatility and should,therefore, be firmly grounded on the fundamentals of mathematics and science.It is much easier to adopt new ideas and new techniques when the principles on which they are based are already familiar.
JIM9. The range of technical education goes far beyond the study of materials and mechanics. Accountancy, costing, salesmanship, commercial skills ofall kinds, including foreign languages, are equally important to a greattrading nation. Full employment brings new problems which are more likely to be soluble the wider is the understanding of how our economyworks. Such subjects as economics, business management, wage systems and human relations must now be given more prominence.TO. In a senss, all technical progress rests upon the common foundation of language, and more attention will have to be given to the teaching ofgood plain English, the use of which saves time and money and avoidstrouble. Without it bridges are hard to build over the gulfs that separateexperts in different specialised subjects not only from the general publicbut from one another.11. A place must always be found in technical studies for liberal educa-tion. The time available often limits what can be done in the way of introducing into the curriculum subjects such as history, literature and the arts, but in any event a wide treatment of scientific and technical subjectsis essential if students who are to occupy responsible positions in industry are to emerge from their education with a broad outlook. We cannot affordeither to fall behind in technical accomplishments or to neglect spiritualand human values.12. Against this background the Government have reviewed the systemof technical education in Great Britain. They are resolved that it shall fullymatch the needs of modern industry and offer to every boy and girl the chance of seizing the opportunities which scientific progress is openingbefore them. This White Paper, having described the progress made duringthe last ten years and the plans already in hand, announces proposals bythe Government for a new major advance.CHAPTER IENGLAND AND WALESTECHNICAL EDUCATION TO-day the school background13. Plans for technical education must take account of progress in the schools. A varied pattern of secondary education is being developed. the aim is to help each boy and girl to go as far as their ability and perseverancewill take them. For this purpose the organisation and interest of the work at the top of secondary schools are vitally important, for at fifteen children are free to leave school.1.4. There are three main types of secondary school: grammar, technical and modern. They take about 20 per cent., 5 per cent., and 75 per cent,of an age-group respectively. The proportions vary from one area toanother to meet local circumstances and preferences. Combinations of twoOf these types constitute &quot;bilateral&quot; schools, and some local educationauthorities are experimenting with comprehensive schools, which aim togive children under one roof the opportunity of all three types of secondary education at standards not inferior to those prevailing in separate schools.15. Recent developments in the schools promise well for the future of technical education. In the grammar schools the pendulum is swingingtowards science.  Of boys who stay on into the sixth forms of maintained
grammar schools about 60 per cent, now take science as their main subject.In the direct grant grammar schools the figure is about 50 per cent, andin the public schools it is over 40 per cent. In many schools to-day theproportion of science sixth formers is so high that a further increase intheir number will depend on an increase in the size of the sixth form as awhole. At the same time -more thought needs to be given to the possibilityof reducing early specialisation and of forging stronger links between thesciences and the arts.16. It must also be said that some grammar schools and public schoolsstill think too much in terms of white-collar jobs for their pupils. Theyfail fully to imagine the cornucopia of the scientific revolution and to pictureto themselves the opportunities which a changing and expanding Britishindustry can offer to their pupils during the next fifty years. If talent isnot to be wasted, more boys and girls must stay on at school till they areeighteen and aim at studying science or technology at either a universityor a technical college providing advanced courses.17. Secondary technical schools, which provide a general secondary educa-tion with an increasing technical bias in the later years of the course, havean important part to play in areas where suitable courses are not already available in grammar schools. Proportionately, indeed, secondary technicalschools have the best record of any kind of school in sending their pupilson to success in technical colleges.18. Too many of these schools still select at thirteen a second layer ofability and put their children through a two or three year course, often in thepremises of a technical college. This must be remedied. The secondarytechnical school of ito-morrow should select at eleven from children ofgrammar school calibre and have buildings of its own and a staff wfaichcomibines academic quality and industrial experience. Schools of this kindcan build up strong sixth forms which will provide candidates for universities and for advanced courses at technical colleges.19. Many secondary technical schools are gradually being transformed inthis way and others are being built. Experience has already shown that these schools can establish a reputation which will be attractive to the ablestchildren of eleven and their parents. The pupils in these schools will look upon a career in industry as their natural goal whether it be reached director through a university.20. Though the grammar and technical schools take, broadly speaking, themost able quarter of the boys and girls from primary schools there is sub-sitantial talent in the secondary modern schools. For example, in 1952-53 outof 2,700 winners of the Higher National Certificate of Mechanical Engineer-ing, 23 per cent, had been to modern schools. Boys and girls in modernschools are beginning to take the General Certificate of Education (Ordinarylevel) at sixteen, and some transfer to the sixth form of a grammar schooland go on to a university.21. With facts such as these in mind modern schools are being encouraged to develop courses for their older pupils which stir their interest in thecareers ahead of them, and act, as it were, as bridges between school andfurther education. These courses attract each year more children to stay onafter fifteen in spite of the high earnings in juvenile employment. Boys and girls who stay on at school arrive at a technical college much better fitted to profit by their first course and much more likely to have the basicknowledge necessary to proceed to higher levels, It is also a great saving to the colleges not to have to teach their young students what they oughtto have learned at school.
. 22. Secondary education will improve as the supply and qualifications of teachers improve. Upon these teachers and their colleagues in the primary schools will largely depend the success of the technical colleges. Too oftenin the past, the colleges have been thought of as mainly concerned with giving a second chance to those who missed or were deprived of opportunities at school. The. stronger the schools become, the more confidently will thetechnical colleges be able to set their standards high.Youth Employment Service23. AH these developments, make, it important for young people to be wellinformed about the new opportunities opened up by technological advance.An important part in this task is played by the Youth Employment service which is provided toy education authorities, or in some areas by the Ministryof Labour, all under the general direction of the Central Youth EmploymentExecutive of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. This service,which has been greatly developed since the war, is in a very good position,in the talks on careers that it arranges in schools and in its individual advisorywork, to make known the range of openings available and to advise on the ways and means toy which training for the various occupations can beobtained; in many cases the service may do the most good by influencing the youngster and his parents in the direction of continuing full-time educationrather than seeking immediate employment.Technical colleges to-day24. Technical colleges are concerned with an unlimited range of technology.Beside the wide field covered by mechanical, electrical, civil, aeronautical and chemical engineering, there are, for example, courses in architecture and building, textiles, mining, plastics and many forms of applied physics andchemistry. Indeed, students from almost every industry can be found in sometechnical college.25. In England and Wales there are about 500 technical or commercialestablishments varying from large colleges of technology, mostly in Londonand the County Borough, to small technical institutes.* Nearly all are maintained by local education authorities. Though some students attend asa condition of their employment, for example, because they are apprentices,most of them are volunteers. Some 80 per cent, of the work is vocationaland most of it is part-time. The fees charged are very low, representing onan average no more than one-fifth of the cost of the course.26. There has never been any uniform pattern of technical educationthroughout the country. Over the last sixty years or so technical colleges have grown up on response to local demand, their siting toeing largely dictated bythe location of industry. A remarkable variety of studies has been organised,from preliminary courses for boys and girls of fifteen to post-graduate work.Courses at every level are often found in the same technical college. Someof the staff are full-time, many are part-time. Some courses are held in theday, more in the evening. Two things common to most colleges are that theywere full soon after they opened and have been bursting at the seams ever since.27. Since 1945, as a result of vigorous efforts by local education authoritiesand industry, more has been done to expand technical education than inany corresponding period.  But with demand always running ahead of supply* There are in addition colleges of art, adult education centres and some 9,000 eveninginstitutes which include a substantial number of students attending for vocational purposes.
the results achieved have not been appreciated as they deserve. Table I shows the growth of the numbers of students at establishments of further educationsince the war.   The figures for 1938 are also shown for comparison.TABLE number OF STUDENTS IN GRANT-AIDED establishments of FURTHER EDUCATIONEngland and Wales			000&apos;s	1937-38	1946-47	1954-55 ProvisionalFull-time     ............	20	45	64Part-time day        .........	89	200	402Evening only (estimated)......	1,094	1,166	1,575Total  ............	1,203	1,411	2,04128.

cr29. The British system of technical education is probably more flexiblethan any other. For example, in most other countries it is very unusual foranyone leaving school before the age of eighteen to be able to embark on a career leading to the highest technological qualifications. The following paragraphs illustrate the routes by which in England and Wales a student mayreach the various goals.The part-time route30. A boy of fifteen can go to a technical institute for a part-time juniorcourse of one year which will improve his general education and help himto start at sixteen on an industrial apprenticeship or a commercial training.At that stage, joined by others who have left school at sixteen or seventeen,he will embark on a senior course of two or three years. Some of these willbe craft courses leading to qualifications prescribed by industry, the examina-tions mostly being conducted by the City and Guilds of London Institute and regional Examining Unions closely associated with it.31. Parallel to the craft courses, or following them, come courses aimed atintermediate qualifications of technician level such as the Ordinary NationalCertificate, certain certificates of the City and Guilds of London Institute, andcertain qualifications of industrial bodies.32. At eighteen or nineteen the advanced stage begins. Until comparativelyrecently only a handful, of students straight from school have been enteringtechnical colleges at this point. Most part-time students at technical collegeshave left school not later than sixteen and have worked their passage, manyby study on one day a week and often one or more evenings as well, andmany by evening work only, towards professional qualifications in engineering and other subjects. Advanced part-time courses last from two to four yearsand lead for most students to a Higher National Certificate, a LondonUniversity degree, or some other recognised examination. Professional quali-fications can be achieved after further study and practical experience in industry, so that the qualified technologist emerges at the age of 23-25.33. In recent years a growing number of short post-graduate courses hasbeen provided for the benefit of scientists and technologists employed in industry who wish to bring themselves up to date with the latest develop-ments. In 1954 some 900 such courses were organised.The full-time route34. Full-time courses have also been organised in many of the majorcolleges. Those for the Ordinary National Diploma provide preliminarytraining suitable for entry into industry at eighteen as a student apprentice.These have not developed to any great extent because the majority of boysand girls who wish to remain in full-time education until they are eighteenprefer to stay at school.35. The courses for the Higher National Diploma, being full-time are muchmore broadly based than those for the Higher National Certificate. Theyhave a wider scientific content and normally include subjects of a liberalnature. Moreover, they often cover the full academic requirements for exemption from the examinations of professional bodies, whereas holders ofthe Higher National Certificate must spend an additional year or two onextra subjects, for example, works organisation and administration, and insome cases further specialised technical study.36. In additon, a number of the major colleges provide full-time coursesleading to graduate and post-graduate qualifications. These have hithertorepresented the highest qualifications available to students in technical colleges.
National Colleges37. Some industries, although important to the national economy, are too small to justify provision for advanced technical studies at more than onecentre for each industry. This fact led the Ministry of Education soon afterthe war to arrange with six industries foundry ; horology and scientificinstrument making ; rubber; leather ; food; and heating, ventilation andrefrigeration engineering to provide a national college for each of them.Selected students are sent full-time by the constituent firms, many of whompay the students&apos; wages during the course, the length of which varies fromone to two years. The governing bodies, which are mainly representative ofthe industries concerned, are independent. The colleges are financed jointlyby the Ministry and by industry, which has been generous towards them in both finance and gifts of equipment.38. The College of Aeronautics at Cranfield differs in its origin and constitution from the other national colleges. It was established by theGovernment following the Fedden Report, and the Ministry of Educationbecame responsible for the administration. The studies are post-graduate,and the governing body includes representatives of the Commonwealth and services as well as industry.Regional Planning39. It was clear as far back as 1925 that the growth of technical collegeswas leading to unnecessary duplication of courses in the highly industrialisedregions. This was particularly true in Yorkshire where, on the advice ofthe then Board of Education, a Regional Advisory Council, representative ofboth educational and industrial interests, was established. Here and inother areas where other types of co-ordinating machinery were establishedmuch successful planning was done. In post-war conditions co-ordinationwas clearly still more desirable and in 1947, nine Regional Advisory Councilswere set up to cover the whole of England. In Wales this function wasentrusted to the Welsh Joint Education Committee. The Regional advisory councils serve two main purposes; (i) to bring education and industrytogether to find out the needs of young workers and advise on the provisionrequired, and (ii) to secure reasonable economy of provision. Associatedwith these Councils are Regional Academic Boards for ensuring close co-operation between the universities and technical colleges in the provisionof advanced courses. Ait the centre a National Advisory Council on Educa-tion for Industry and Commerce, which is largely representative of the regions,advises the Minister on national policy.40. Much has been done by these bodies to establish good relations betweenindustry and the colleges and to stimulate sound development. They must clearly play an even greater part in the future if courses, especially advancedcourses, are to be organised on a strong and efficient basis and if adequate facilities are to be provided with reasonable economy in buildings andteaching staff.Wales41. Before the war the provision for technical education in Wales was, by comparison with that in England, somewhat meagre. This was a reflectionof the traditional interest in grammar school education, seen mainly as apassport to the liberal professions, and of the fact that, in the past, Welshindustry, which was largely restricted to coal-mining, quarrying, iron, steel and tinplate, offered opportunities to relatively small numbers for skilledemployment and high qualifications. Even so, the number of young Welsh-men who availed themselves of these opportunities was insufficient for the11
oountry&apos;s needs they preferred to be trained as teachers, clergymen, adminis-administrators, lawyers and doctors, to work in Wales and elsewhere, while the smallWelsh demand for skilled engineers and technicians was, to some extent,met from other parts of the United Kingdom.42. The industrial situation has changed considerably during the lastgeneration. The character of the old-established industries has beentransformed and many new industries have settled in Wales. The coal-mining and metallurgical industries are now more highly mechanised and thenew factories, like their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom,depend on skilled craftsmen, mechanical, electrical, production and chemicalengineers, on draughtsmen and scientists for their maintenance and develop-ment. Such a change is equivalent to a new industrial revolution in the life of the Principality, and as such, it constitutes a challenge to establishedways, particularly in educational outlook and provisions. Young workersentering Welsh industry at fifteen to-day need opportunities for training as craftsmen as never before. Welsh grammar school pupils are wantedin industries that did not exist when their fathers were boys. Consequentlymore students must be attracted into advanced courses in technical institutesand colleges and into degree courses in applied science at the University of wales if the youth of Wales is to equip itself for leadership in the economic life of the Principality.43. The continuing growth in technical education in recent years is themeasure of the country&apos;s response to this challenge. Since the war full-timestudents at establishments of further education in Wales have increased from1,500 to 2,500, part-time day students from 8,500 to 21,000 and eveningstudents from 73,000 to 115,000.44. During the same period seventeen new colleges have been completedor put under construction, while sixteen others have been extended.45. These facts represent a real achievement in meeting the altered situation.The older establishments are also readjusting their work. For example, yearby year more grammar schools are providing courses with a technical biasand the Welsh Joint Education Committee has correspondingly extended itsexamination arrangements to meet their needs and those of the technicalinstitutes and colleges as well. It has also provided a forum for discussion and guidance to those local education authorities within whose areas thedemands for advanced technical education have reached considerabledimensions.46. This service has been a valuable one because the industrial pattern of Wales still differs from that of England. There have been far-reachingchanges but Welsh undertakings, with one or two notable exceptions, aregenerally not so large nor so highly concentrated as their English counter-parts, and the numbers of apprentices employed in separate establishmentsare comparatively small. Plans for advanced technical education in Walesmust correspond with this situation. They must assume a readiness on thepart of local education authorities and industry to co-operate if the bestcourses at the advanced level are to be provided for the technical experts of the future. Leaders of the educational and industrial life of the Prin-cipality must increasingly come to regard selected colleges as common posses-sions, to be developed to the highest level of academic efficiency in theirown fields ; uneconomic and wasteful proliferation of small advanced courseswould provide only the second-rate, and would not be good enough as aneducational support for modern industry.
CHAPTER IITHE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITIES47. In the education of technologists, the technical colleges are the partnersof the universities. Their functions are complementary and although this paper is not primarily concerned with the universities, it would be incompletewithout some account of the role they play and of their recent development.48. The contribution of the universities to both education and research in advanced technology as well as in pure science, is fundamental to ourprogress as a country. As explained below, the Government attach thegreatest importance to the development of higher technology in the universities.49. In some universities the technological studies are of a general nature:in others, they are more closely linked with the careers available in the region, such as the textile or chemical industries. Invariably, these studies are set against the broad background of fundamental science, and specialisations-tion in technology is often not attempted until the post-graduate stage.Although many students work in factories in the vacations, at most universitiesthey gain their first real experience of industry after graduation or after aperiod of post-graduate study or research.50. The universities have greatly expanded since the war, and this expan-sion has been mainly on the scientific side. In 1946 the Committee on scientific Manpower (Cmd. 6824) recommended that the university outputof scientists and technologists should be doubled. The universities responded to this call and accepted a heavy degree of overcrowding to meet the pentup demand of those whose university careers had been interrupted or post-poned owing to the war. The number of full-time university students of science and technology rose from 12,949 in 1938-39 to 27,659 in 1950-51,an increase of 121 per cent. While this peak was not wholly maintainedwhen the ex-service demand fell off, the reduction in numbers was surprisinglysmall, and they are now rising again. In the current session full-timestudents of science and technology have reached a new peak of 29,013,132 per cent, above the 1938-39 figure. They now represent 34J per cent,of the university student population, as against 26 per cent, in 1938-39.The numbers obtaining first degrees in science and technology is now just over 6,000. Of these pure science accounts for 4,200, many of whomultimately enter industry, and technology for about 1,850. There are, inaddition, some 450 students who obtain diplomas in technology.51. During the whole of the period since the war, buildings for teaching and research in science and technology have received high priority in theallocation of grants by the University Grants Committee towards capitalexpenditure by the universities.52. Of  24^ million spent or committed since the war on major buildingschemes ( 50,000 or more) from moneys at the free disposal of the university grants Committee,  7f million was allocated to buildings of interest to allfaculties (halls of residence, student amenities, libraries, etc.) and  16^ million to buildings for teaching and research. Of this  16J million, about 84 percent, went to science in its various forms including technology and medicine.These figures do not include the special allocations for technology referredto below: nor do they include the extension of the Manchester College of technology, costing about t\\ million, which has been financed by loans raised by the Corporation of Manchester.
m53. The Government decided that a still further effort was needed to extend the supply of university trained technologists and in 1953 they announced their intention to undertake a massive expansion of the Imperial college of Science and Technology (University of London) to enable its studentnumbers to be increased from 1,650 to 3,000: they have already increasedby about a quarter. This project will ultimately cost about  15 million. Afurther programme of development outside London was announced on the7th December, 1954. This includes major developments at Glasgow,Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham ; schemes on a fairly large scale atCambridge and Sheffield ; and specialised developments at other universities,financed in some cases by Treasury grant and in others by industry, atEdinburgh, Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Southampton andSwansea. The developments at Glasgow and Manchester are based on the colleges of Technology as well as on the universities. The capital grantsrequired to finance these developments will amount to about  5 million and  1^ million for equipment. These grants have been supplemented on aconsiderable scale by benefactions from industry of both money andequipment.54. Most of the building projects in the programme outlined in the previous paragraph are already under construction and all will have been started by 1957, the final year of the present university quinquennium, which began in 1952. The Universities are now formulating their plans for further develop-ments to be put in hand during the quinquennium 1957-62. The university grants Committee, who will consider these proposals, will then make recommendations to the Government during the present year.CHAPTER iii the PLAN FOR THE TECHNICAL COLLEGES OF ENGLANDAND WALES55. Against the background described in Chapter II the Government havedecided on a further expansion of technical colleges. For this purpose they propose to put in hand immediately a five-year programme of developmentrelated as closely as can be to the most urgent demands and the extent of available resources. The objectives during this period are to increase byabout a half the output of students from advanced courses at technical colleges and, as part of a proportionate increase at the lower levels, to double the numbers released by their employers for part-time courses duringthe day. This will call for building to be started in the period 1956-61to the value of about  70 million. When these objectives are secured, theGovernment will consider what further measures are needed. The detailsof the five-year plan are described below.TECHNOLOGISTS56. The mixture of earning and learning made possible by technical colleges continues to demonstrate its success. The students have proved theirworth in practice and employers want more of them. The present annual output from advanced courses at technical colleges in England and Wales
(including roughly 1,000 who gain degrees in science and about 500 whogain degrees in technology) is about 9,500. The proportion of these whoultimately become technologists in the sense in which the term is used inthis Paper (see page 1) is not precisely known, but is probably about one half. The Government now propose to raise the capacity of advanced coursesat technical colleges as soon as possible from 9,500 to about 15,000.Advanced full-time and sandwich courses57. As technologies grow more complex and the need for versatilityincreases, the strain of reaching these high qualifications by evening work or by studies on one or two days a week becomes more severe. There willbe many, especially those who ambitions do not extend beyond the HigherNational Certificate, who will wish or will be obliged by circumstances tocontinue to take part-time courses. But the Government believe that forthe highest technological qualifications sandwich courses will become moreand more appropriate. These are courses lasting four or five years andinvolving alternate periods, usually of three to six months, of theoreticaleducation in a technical college and specially designed practical training in industry.58. These advanced courses will suit the able worker who has already hadexperience in industry and should also attract an increasing number of boysand girls who, when they leave school at eighteen, feel the urge to starttheir careers as soon as possible.59. The National Advisory Council on Education for Industry and commerce under the chairmanship of Lieut-General Sir Ronald Weeks has very recently submitted to the Minister of Education a report on sandwichcourses. This report has been prepared after consultation with the Federationof British Industries, the National Union of Manufacturers, the Associationof Chambers of Commerce, the Trades Union Congress and the associations of local education authorities and teachers, and all these bodies haveexpressed their general support for the proposals in it. It is reproducedas Appendix B to this Paper. The Government fully endorse this report.Sandwich courses have been or are being developed for the building, chemical,electrical, mechanical engineering, mining and railway industries and similar arrangements for other industries will be vigorously encouraged.60. Sandwich courses at the highest level will, no doubt, be eligible forthe new Award to be given by the National Council for Technological Awardsunder the chairmanship of Lord Hives. This Council has been set up on therecommendation of the National Advisory Council on Education for Industryand Commerce. At the moment, the only national qualification of sufficientlyhigh level for many of the best students attending technical colleges is theLondon External Degree. This suffers from the disadvantages inherent inexternal control and is limited to a few technologies. It was therefore con-sidered to be unsuitable as a permanent qualification for colleges of advanced technology. In the National Advisory Council&apos;s view the best way of over-coming the difficulty was to create a new qualification of high standing whichwould allow the colleges freedom to plan their own courses in consultationwith industry and the professional bodies and to conduct their own examina-tions. The National Council for Technological Awards, which is an indepen-dent body, was recently established to create and administer this new qualifi-cation and to satisfy itself that conditions of teaching, and the syllabuses andexaminations, are satisfactory. This is a vital task: the work of the council will do much to determine the scope and quality of advanced technologicalstudies in the next generation.1:5
Aid to students61. These developments must be backed by an adequate system of finan-cial aid. For those alreday employed in industry Technical State Scholar-ships are available to help students of outstanding intellectual ability to pursue honours degree courses at universities or courses of equivalent stand-ing elsewhere. Students proposing to attend courses leading to a Tech-nological Award will, therefore, be eligible for Technical State Scholarshipsand the number will be raised as these courses develop.62. In order to encourage boys and girls to enter these courses straightfrom school, the Government propose in future to allow ordinary StateScholarships awarded on the results of the General Certificate of EducationExamination to be held not only for honours courses at universities, but also for courses leading to a Technological Award.63. Local education authorities already have power to assist students at such courses and, in view of the academic level of these studies, authoritiesare being asked to give such assistance in the form of Major Awards, i.e.,at rates equivalent to those paid to university students.64. The Government are glad to note that many of the students nowattending advanced sandwich courses are assisted generously by their employers. Enlightened firms pay the college fees and the students&apos; wagesduring studies, the latter at a rate which would be earned if the studentswere working in industry. This arrangement attracts students to the courses,stimulates their sense of loyalty to the firms and strengthens the firms&apos; ties withthe colleges. This is a healthy development which the Government have encouraged by allowing the payment of fees to count as a business expensefor income tax purposes, and they hope to see more firms adopting this practice.,Colleges of Advanced Technology65. The Government consider that the bulk of full-time or sandwich coursesshould be carried on in colleges which concentrate on advanced courses of technological level.66. Teachers capable of taking charge of such courses are scarce and the equipment they need is often expensive. Moreover, an advanced course inone technology often cannot be efficient unless allied technologies are studiedto a similar level in the same college. The college must also be strong in theappropriate fundamental sciences. And opportunities for research are essen-tial in order to promote fully effective co-operation between industry and thestaff of the technical college.67. In 1952 a special rate of 75 per cent, grant was introduced to foster the development of technical colleges in which a large proportion of the work would consist of advanced work and research in technology including courses in advanced technology at graduate and post-graduate levels.68. The following twenty-four* colleges at present receive 75 per cent,grant for certain of their advanced work:  Birmingham College of Technology.Bradford Technical College.Brighton Technical College.  .* The Manchester College of Technology, which has been receiving 75 per cent, grant, hasnow been granted a Royal Charter and will come under the aegis of the University GrantsCommittee.  It is therefore not included in the list.

The Government now wish to see the proportion of advanced work at these colleges vigorously increased. The Minister of Education will discussforthwith with the local education authorities concerned how this can be donewithin the framework of the building programme announced in this Paper.In addition there may be a few other colleges which, because of developmentsnow in train or the movement of industry, may qualify for 75 per cent,grant.70. The building up of colleges of advanced technology will not preventthe development elsewhere in suitable cases of advanced courses, particularly those of a part-time nature. Indeed, part-time advanced courses are already provided in some 150 local colleges conveniently placed for the students and part-time staff who work in industry. These courses make a vital contribu-tion to the total output of technologists, especially by the Higher NationalCertificate route, and they will be expected to continue and develop as longas they are efficient and can attract enough students.71. There are those who argue that a college of advanced technologycannot be successfully administered within the framework of local govern-ment. The Government do not accept this. Local authorities take greatpride in such colleges and often have been willing to find more money forthem than the pressure on national resources has allowed them to spend.To remove them from local control against the wishes of the authorities could be justified neither by past experience nor by the hope of betterresults from a more central control. This statement is, however, subject toone qualification: the Government do rely on the local authorities to work
effectively together in planning the provision of courses and just as impor-tant in making it possible for students, whether they live in their own or another local authority&apos;s area, to attend courses which best suit their needs.72. Colleges of advanced technology must also have the independenceappropriate to the academic level of their work. Some local authorities have pointed the way by establishing strong governing bodies widely representativeof industry and with power to spend within the heads of annual estimatesapproved by the authority. The Minister is taking steps in consultation withthe local education authorities concerned to ensure the general adoption ofthis policy for all colleges of advanced technology. He also proposes to review the accommodation and equipment of each such college and to satisfyhimself that the staff are adequately qualified and have appropriate freedom to plan their own courses.73. Within the five-year programme of capital development announced inthis Paper the colleges of advanced technology will be expected to makeconsiderable progress in increasing their volume of advanced work, especially by means of full-time and sandwich courses, and in divesting themselves ofwork below the advanced level. They will be expected, too, to develop asubstantial amount of research, particularly research sponsored by industry,and, where appropriate, to initiate post-graduate studies. They should alsoencourage their staff to undertake a reasonable amount of consulting work.74. For all this to be done the scale of staffing will have to be more generous than it is in some cases at present. This must be faced, for thesecolleges are of crucial importance to the future of technological education inthis country.75. These and all other colleges engaged on advanced work will beexpected to develop close contacts with the appropriate universities. This is done today both direct and through the Regional Academic Boards for technical Education on which the universities^ the local education authorities,the technical colleges and industry are represented. It seems probable thatthe resources of both universities and colleges could be co-ordinated to greatereffect than is sometimes the case at present.TECHNICIANS AND CRAFTSMEN76. The conditions which demand an increase in technologists apply alsoto technicians. As many as five or six technicians may be required to everytechnologist. The Minister of Labour and National Service has already askedindustry, through his National Joint Advisory Council, to consider futureneeds for technicians and craftsmen and how to meet them.77: The traditional method of training technicians and craftsmen in thiscountry is apprenticeship, of which the characteristic feature is that theapprentice receives practical training in employment for a period of years.Versatility and grasp of principles are indispensable for enabling those whoare being trained today to keep up-to-date and play their part effectively inthe conditions of the future. In view of this employers in most industries which have adopted apprenticeship schemes have agreed to release theirapprentices for one day a week for attendance at technical classes wherefacilities exist.78. Since the war there has been a great increase in the use made of such facilities, but there is certainly scope for more. Table IV shows the widevariations in the practice of day release in different industries.

79. Technical education, essential as it is, is always regarded as an adjunctto, and not a substitute for, practical training on the job. Industry, therefore,must play the leading part in any increased output of craftsmen, but theGovernment will be ready to do its share in providing the additional facilitiesfor technical education which may be required both to match any rise in numbers as well as to meet any call for more intensive technical education of apprentices.80. The terms of apprenticeship and education should be adjusted to suitchanging needs. For example, it is undesirable that rigid apprenticeship age limits should prevent the completion of a pre-apprenticeship full-time coursewhere this is found to provide a useful preparation for a young person whointends to become a skilled craftsman but who would not finish the courseuntil after his sixteenth birthday. At the other end, the withdrawal of the privilege of day release at the age of eighteen, which sometimes occurs in themiddle of an educational year, discourages both students and colleges.Wastage81. Serious wastage occurs at present in courses for technicians and crafts-men. In many courses only one-quarter of those who start reach and succeed in the examination which comes at the end of it.82. Most of the wastage takes place at the age of about sixteen. Themain reasons for it are reliance on evening classes, the need to work overtime,being away on a job, shift work, travelling difficulties, ill-health, a change to another job, home conditions which make study there impossible, or lack ofencouragement from the employer. Some of these are irremediable, but thepresent rate of wastage can be reduced by greater understanding on the partof parents and employers, by better selection and especially by the substitution of part-time day for evening classes.83. It is not always easy to judge whether a boy or girl of fifteen or sixteenwill be able to make a success of a particular course and it is human to erron the side of generosity. Young people want to feel that they can go far.But it is a mistaken kindness to admit them to courses for which their ability is clearly inadequate. The temptation to do this is less where thereis a system of easy transfer upwards from one grade of course to another.84. Experience shows that wastage from part-time day courses, especially the large majority which are attended as part of a formal apprenticeshiptraining, is much less than from evening classes. The local education autho-rities and industry will therefore be urged to enable more and more boysand girls to study during the day instead of in the evening. At technicianlevel it may well be advantageous to provide some of these day-time classes inthe shape&quot; of sandwich courses as recommended in the report at Appendix B tothis Paper.85. Table IV shows the number of boys and girls under eighteen released by their employers during the day in 1953-54. In that year the number of students of all ages released during the day was 326,000. In 1954-55 this number rose to 355,000. The Governments aim now is to see this last figuredoubled.Refresher courses86. As industrial techniques develop it will be important to provide oppor-tunities for workers in mid-career to bring themselves up to date. Trainingin new skills will remain the responsibility of industry, but it will be for thetechnical colleges to provide short courses designed to explain the principlesinvolved.
-   THE FURTHER EDUCATION OF GIRLS87. Girls are a match for boys at school. They do at least as well in the selection at eleven plus and in most secondary school examinations. But once they leave school far fewer girls continue their education. The only exceptionis that twice as many girls as boys take full-time courses in further educationbetween the ages of fifteen and eighteen, but the numbers involved are verysmall. The picture is quite different for part-time courses, for which four times as many boys as girls are released. Among girls of eighteen only one in five pursues any form of education. How unsatisfactory these figures are canbe seen against the fact that half the girls and women in the country betweenthe ages of fifteen and thirty-five are &quot; gainfully occupied&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of these young women are not making the best use of their talentsbecause they stopped their education when they left school.88. A great many girls do not see the point of further education once theyhave got a job. Their hopes are naturally bent on marriage and they fearperhaps though there is much experience to prove them wrong that byaiming at a certificate they may miss a husband.89. Employers, finding that many girls marry early and give up their jobs,often think it not worth while to help the girls who come to them from schoolto continue their education. We find, for example, that only one girl intwenty-five in the distributive trades, which employ over a quarter of thegirls in work, is released for a day-time course. In short, so many girlsleave school with the idea that whatever job they take they are only fillingin time till they get married that the demand for their further education isvery much smaller than it ought to be.90. A change of outlook is needed, not because more girls and women should be persuaded to go out to work, but because further education willenable the great number who do earn their living to qualify for better jobsand to gain the maximum pleasure and profit from their work; and, contraryto old-fashioned ideas, such further education is not wasted if a girl marriesand exchanges a career outside the home for one within it. Far more oftenthan not the knowledge and experience that comes from studying for a betterjob helps her to build her own family on foundations of common interestsand understanding.91. Apart from teaching, the most popular courses with girls cover suchsubjects as nursing, commercial and secretarial work, commercial andindustrial design, art, the needle trades, catering, cookery and domesticsubjects. Fair numbers are taking courses in scientific subjects, but there isno doubt many more could take up science and would find openings for most successful careers. The problem is how to increase the number ofgirls asking for science courses, and the weakness here is in the secondary schools, where there is a shortage of teachers of mathematics and sciencemore pronounced than in boys&apos; schools. The best point to attack this problemmust.be in the girls&apos; grammar schools where the Head could influence moregirls, who have decided to take up teaching, to choose science or mathematicsas their special subject. Only small numbers of girls at present decide to study science or mathematics at the universities or training colleges. It isin the national interest that more should be encouraged to do so.92. We do not know the precise extent of the reserve of talent among ouryoung people, which waits to be developed by further education ; but it is safe to say that it is greater among the girls than the boys. As, however, theambition to marry will very rightly continue to be uppermost in the thoughts
of girls, progress in recruiting more girls and women for courses in technical colleges depends on their recognition that further education will help andnot hinder the prospects of a happy married life.THE PROGRAMME OF CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT93. The building programme for technical colleges for 1956-57 is planned to reach about  9 million. Though this is  2 million larger than the 1955-56programme and nearly  4 million larger than the 1954-55 programme, it isa good deal less than local education authorities have asked for. The Govern-ment propose to step the programme up. The rate of the increase will bedecided from time to time, [in the light of economic circumstances and progress with the programme], but the general intention is to start  70 million worth of work within a period of five years, i.e., over the years 1956-57 to 1960-61inclusive. These projects are estimated to require the expenditure of a further 15 million for equipment.94. For projects such as technical colleges, which are often large and always complex, the present system of compiling annual programmes only about twelve months ahead of the beginning of the year in which the projectsare due to be started is inadequate. In order to give authorities longer notice,the Minister of Education will approve this spring a programme of  15 million for 1957-58 and a [provisional] programme, also of  15 million, for 1958-59.Thus, taking into account the programme of  9 million already approved for1956-57, the Government&apos;s proposals provide for a total of  39 million worth of work to be started during the first three years of the five-year period.95. When the programme for 1957-58 and the [provisional] programme for 1958-59 have been approved, the Minister will invite advance proposalsfor 19.59-60 and 1960-61 with a view to encouraging authorities to proceedwith the planning of at least the larger projects which should be started inthose years. The 1959-60 programme as a whole will be approved not later than the spring of 1957.96. Our best post-war schools have become famous throughout the worldbecause they combine low cost with high quality of design, construction andfinish. The lessons which have been learned in school building will be appliedto technical colleges. Fine college buildings can illustrate, as nothing elsecan, the confidence in the future which inspires the expansion of technical education. The Government hope that in view of the importance of these projects local authorities will be careful to choose good architects whetherfrom their own staff or from those in private practice. They hope too thatauthorities will insist on adequate briefing and planning before building beginsand that architects and contractors will combine to show what efficient team-work can achieve.97. A technical college is much more than a collection of workshops, laboratory-tories and classrooms. There must be facilities for food, recreation and social life, and at some colleges of advanced technology hostel accommodationwill be required. It is hoped that industries for which courses leading to thenew; technological award have been arranged will help to provide hostelsfor their employees.98. At the lower levels many more buildings for technical education willbe required close to the homes or work of the young people concerned.Local colleges will be needed both to relieve the colleges of advanced tech-nology of their less advanced work and to provide a location for the day-timecourses which will be substituted for some of the evening classes at secondary schools.
THE SUPPLY OF TEACHERS99. There are at present some 40,000 part-time and about 9,000 full-timeteachers in technical colleges. These figures show the dependence of the collegeson part-time teachers. About 9,500 of them are school teachers who teachin technical colleges in the evening. Most of the rest are drawn from industryand commerce on account of their special qualifications and experience. some are released by their employers to teach part-time day students. Many teachclasses in their spare time.100. A considerable number of the full-time teachers are university gradu-ates with industrial experience. Others have technician or craft qualifications.Many come from the ranks of the part-time: they acquire a liking for teach-ing when they are given charge of part-time classes and then turn over to full-time service as the opportunity arises. Indeed teachers recruited in thisfashion are often among the best. Such transfers from industry by men in mid-career are an important source of strength to the technical colleges.101. To achieve the objectives set out in this Paper many more: teacherswill be required. The Government hope that industry will be ready to releaseyet more of its employees for part-time teaching during the day, so that itsapprentices may be given the more through grounding which modern conditions require.102. The supply of full-time teachers has recently been growing at the very satisfactory rate of 700 to 800 a year. Local education authorities have asubstantial measure of discretion over salaries for technical college staffs andby offering the right conditions of service they should be able to attract areasonable share of the available technical manpower.103. The success of our plans depends as much on quality of teaching ason numbers. In improving quality training can play an important part.Since 1945 training colleges for technical teachers, mainly for full-timeteachers, have been established in London and at Bolton and Huddersfield.The Ministry of Education, local education authorities and RegionalAdvisory Councils run many short courses for part-time teachers and anumber of well-known firms have co-operated in this work, lending staff andlecturers for the courses and giving the teachers opportunities to keep abreastof industrial developments. The professional institutions, which have done so much to raise standards in technical education, have also helped by organis-ing conferences for teachers on modern methods in teaching and industrialpractice.104. The Government hope to see more and more teachers taking advantageof these facilities and as the supply of teachers improves it will be possiblefor increasing numbers to be released by local education authorities forrefresher experience in industry. This experience is invaluable and the prac-tice should be encouraged to the fullest extent possible.TECHNICAL LITERATURE105. Every technical college should have a library with adequate suppliesof technical books and journals. The library can play an important part inthe general life of the college, and especially in the development of itsadvanced work and in training students in methods of handling technicalliterature. Its first duty is to the staff and students of the college. It can also, however, give valuable service by making its resources available tolocal industry and by acting as a centre for the supply of technical informa-tion and the exchange of technical ideas. In this way the library can make some return for the release of part-time teachers from industry, which is so
vital to the Governmenfs plans. For these reasons every technical collegelibrary should have a grant large enough to enable its acquisition of books and periodicals to keep pace with technical developments.106. There should also be as much co-operation as possible between college,public and other libraries at local, regional and national levels. This willmake easier the interchange of technical material and information, which isparticularly desirable in view of the high cost of many technical books.CHAPTER IVSCOTLANDTHE STRUCTURE OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND107. What is said in the introduction to this Paper on the need for andthe aims of technical education and on the distinguishing features of theform that kind of education takes in Britain, applies to Scotland no less than to England and Wales. In other ways, too, technical education in both countries has much in common. In both, boys leaving school at fifteen canpursue their studies part-time right up to an advanced standard comparable with that of a university degree. Those completing a full secondary schoolcourse at seventeen or eighteen can enter the part-time courses at technical colleges at a higher level, or can enter on full-time courses for a degree orcomparable award. Again, the part-time qualifications which are so importanta feature of technical education the National Certificates and the awards of the City and Guilds of London Institute are the same in both countries.But there has been a considerable difference in the evolution of the structurewithin which technical education is given in the two countries. After a shortsurvey of secondary education as the foundation of that structure, this chapterdescribes its development in Scotland and the Governmenfs proposals forcarrying forward that development to keep pace with the needs of the new industrial age.SECONDARY EDUCATION108. Pupils are allocated to secondary courses, usually between the ages11^ and 12^ according to their fitness to profit from them, but may betransferred to another course later if necessary. Courses are of two maintypes, those extending normally to three years, called junior secondary courses and intended for pupils leaving school at fifteen, and those extending to five or six years, known as senior secondary courses. The former correspondroughly to those provided in secondary modern schools in England, whilethe latter cater broadly for the types of pupils who are there admitted togrammar schools and secondary technical schools. Both provide a generaleducation but are differentiated to suit varying needs and abilities, and bothinclude technical courses. While some schools offer only junior secondarycourses and some only senior secondary, in a number of schools of the&quot; comprehensive &quot;type, both are provided.109. Junior secondary courses are attended by about 70 per cent, of secondary pupils. All the pupils study science and at least some mathematicsand all boys receive a training in crafts and in technical subjects. In their recent memorandum &quot; Junior Secondary Education &quot; the Scottish education department have recommended a realistic approach to all subjects which will
take account of the lives the pupils will later lead as individuals and ascitizens, and of their vocational aims. The great majority of the pupils leaveat fifteen to enter employment, but a number of schools have successfullydeveloped intensive fourth year classes in which those who remain at schoolcan prepare themselves for more advanced technical and commercialeducation, and this development is receiving every encouragement.110. Senior secondary courses account for as much as 30 per cent, of thetotal secondary intake and even this figure is exceeded in some areas. these courses normally lead to presentation for the Scottish Leaving Certificate,which corresponds broadly to the General Certificate of Education inEngland. Candidates may be presented in the fifth or sixth year in anysubject on either the lower or the higher grade. The standard of the lower grade corresponds roughly to that of the ordinary level of the GeneralCertificate of Education, but that of the higher grade, not being based on aperiod of specialised study in a sixth form in the English sense, is not as high as that of the advanced level. Pupils may also be presented on thelower grade only in the fourth year provided they are leaving school at theend of that year, a condition which it is now proposed to remove.111. The great majority of boys and girls study both mathematics and science for at least three years, and the number taking these subjects up tothe level of the Scottish Leaving Certificate has increased steadily. In 1954,mathematics with 7,418 candidates, was second only to English with 8,499,and science with 4,861 occupied fifth place among the 25 subjects of the examination. Practically all the schools have facilities for craft work andfor technical subjects, and 145 out of a total of 235 provide courses in technicalsubjects leading to the Scottish Leaving Certificate.112. The relatively high percentage of the secondary intake alreadyadmitted to senior secondary courses suggests that expansion of numbersmust come mainly from a reduction in wastage. Although the number of pupils in the fifth and sixth years has been gradually increasing, many pupilsof ability still leave prematurely, and concerted efforts are being made byapproaches both to the pupils and to their parents, to encourage more tocomplete the course and qualify themselves either for further study or for entry to the professions and to the higher ranges of industry and commerce.If this aim is to be achieved the schools must cater adequately not only forthe minority of academic bent, but also for those whose needs would bebetter met by courses of a more practical character. - The curriculum is accordingly now being examined with a view to introducing as much varietyand flexibility as possible, and to ensuring proper integration with courses of further education at the various levels.CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS113. In Scotland, in contrast to England, the keystone of the system of technical education has been, not the local technical college administered bya single education authority and serving that authority&apos;s area, but the centralinstitution functioning on a regional basis. These institutions came into existence in the first decade of the present century under independentgoverning bodies representing the educational, industrial and other publicinterests in the region. From the outset, they were designed to provide, inaddition to such other less advanced facilities as might be appropriate, thehighest forms of instruction in applied science, together with opportunities of research and discovery. In the words of the official announcement of thispolicy in 1901: &quot; It is from such institutions . . . that decisive advantage tothe industries of the country, in so far as that is dependent on educationalarrangements, is to be looked for &quot;.
114. Scotland, therefore, began not with a large number of local technical colleges as the broad base of a pyramid on which higher institutions wouldlater be raised, but with a small number of central institutions as pioneercentres which blazed the trail in technical education and round which localoutposts-the local further education centres were later to grow up, drawinginspiration from the central institutions. That technical education in scotland should originate in this regional framework is largely attributable to factorsof geography and population. It has proved itself well suited to the needsof a small country with a limited population heavily concentrated in a fewindustrial areas. The central institutions of which 7* are concerned withthe strictly &quot; technical&quot; subjects have grown steadily in importance andusefulness as their range of courses, numbers of students, both full-time and part-time, and buildings have expanded. Not only have they made greatstrides within their own bounds in developing the higher forms of technical education, but they have exercised a profound influence on the provision madeby education authorities at the more elementary levels.Full-time Courses115. From the outset, the courses offered at the colleges full-time and part-time covered a wide range of subjects including the sciences, pure and applied, and the technologies relating to industries, such as engineering inall its branches, building, printing, baking, brewing and woollen manufacture.The distinguishing feature of the colleges has been the full-time coursesleading to their own diploma or associateship. Indeed, in some, the greater proportion of the work is full-time. The numbers taking these courses have risen from 1,600 in 1938 to 2,000 in 1954.116. The full-time courses are of three or four years&apos; duration, and com-parable in scope and standard with university degrees. Age and qualifications for entry are usually similar to those for a university degree, except asregards such requirements as a foreign language. The awards thus instituted by the individual colleges have won for themselves an increasing reputationboth in Scotland and beyond which testifies to the high standard of instructionprovided. The highest awards of the two leading central institutions theRoyal Technical College, Glasgow, and the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, are now recognised as being of honours degree standard. That such awardsare becoming increasingly attractive to students and acceptable to industryis shown by the striking expansion in the last few years in the numberscompleting the appropriate courses at the two colleges. Thus at the RoyalTechnical College, the number of associateship awards rose from 97 in1950-51 to 160 in 1954-55 (a number of the same students taking theUniversity degree as well). At the Heriot-Watt College between the sameyears the number of associateship awards rose from 49 to 65.117. In addition, under affiliation arrangements with their respectiveUniversities, these two Colleges provide a number of courses leading to theB.Sc. degree of the universities. At Aberdeen, Robert Gordon&apos;s Collegehave long had a scheme of co-operation with the University for joint teaching of degree and diploma students in engineering. This has recently been revised to obtain still closer co-operation in future.   The other central institutions* These are: Aberdeen, Robert Gordon&apos;s Technical College;Dundee, Institute of Art and Technology;Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt College;Galashiels, The Scottish Woollen Technical College;Glasgow, The Royal Technical College;Leith Nautical Technical College;Paisley Technical College.
provide courses for external degrees of London University as well as for theirown awards and for Higher National Diplomas. A considerable amount of research, much of it for industrial concerns, is carried out at the variouscentral institutions, and post-graduate awards are available at some of them.118. One of these central institutions the Royal Technical College isgenerally recognised as having pioneered the sandwich course wherebystudents spend one part of the year in study at the College and the remainderin practical work in industry. This method of training can be traced to thediploma courses at the College as far back as the 1880&apos;s and has been maintained there ever since. The same practice has been followed for theengineering degree courses of Glasgow University, both at the University itself and at the College, and is regarded as of the highest value as a method ofstudy in the technological field. In more recent years it has been successfullyintroduced in certain courses at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, and atPaisley Technical College.119. A later development in the associateship courses which has been ofsome importance and which may be of even greater significance in future isthe acceptance into the penultimate year of men who have gained their HigherNational Certificates. In this way, these men, by the addition of two years&apos;full-time study to their five or more years&apos; part-time study, can carry theiradvanced studies to a level comparable with the highest available anywhere in this country, and secure a qualification recognised as equivalent to anhonours degree. Students recruited by this means are regarded as of thefinest quality obtainable anywhere, and they represent one of the few hithertountapped pools of real talent from which any substantial additional numbersof technologists of first-class calibre can be drawn.Part-time Courses120. Alongside their full-time courses, the central institutions provide a wide range of part-time courses. At first these were evening only, but laterpart-time day classes were added. These courses range from those at HigherNational Certificate level to pre-National Certificate courses for boys whohave just left school, courses for certificates of the City and Guilds of LondonInstitute or courses of a purely practical nature for young apprentices.Although, as described below, some of these courses are being graduallytransferred to local centres run by education authorities, the following figures show the large numbers of part-time students still attending the sevencentral institutions concerned.Year Day Evening Total1946 ...      ...     1,238 5,844 7,0821954 ......     4,422 10,349 14,771LOCAL CENTRESEvening Clasess121..Alongside the growth of the central institutions in the first decadesof the present century, education authorities greatly developed the provisionof evening classes at the more elementary stages of technical subjects, andthe &quot;night school&quot; became a traditional feature of the training of theyoung Scottish worker. But these classes could be accommodated only inschool premises, and, in the absence of special equipment, had to be confinedwithin a relatively narrow range. As a result of this factor and the verysuccess of the central institutions in discharging their all-embracing taskthere was, up to the last war, a tendency in Scotland which is still all tooprevalent to look to the central institutions for the provision of all types of technical education outside the normal evening classes.
Local Technical Colleges122. But the increasing range and complexity of scientific and technologicalknowledge and the steady growth in demand for technical education, bothday and evening, made it impracticable and undesirable that the central institutions should continue to cover the entire range of technical education in Scotland. In certain areas, therefore, education authorities even beforethe last war, began to develop, in addition to their evening class provision,centres for technical education or local technical colleges as they are nowcalled. By this means the central institutions could be relieved of the moreelementary stages of their work and left free to develop the more advancedcourses&apos; and studies and to increase the numbers of the students in them.123. Some 50 local technical colleges and other day institutes providingpre-vocational or other full-time courses and part-time day-release coursesthus came to be established. A few were built specially for the purpose beforethe war, but the main expansion has taken place since 1940. As a consequenceof war-time and post-war restrictions, most of these centres have had to be housed in adapted or improvised accommodation converted factories andredundant school premises predominating or have had to share premises withschools. The consequence has been that, in the absence of premises builtspecially for the purpose, the courses provided in many of the centres havebeen confined within too narrow a range. The makeshift nature of the accommodation has also tended to depress the demand and interest ofemployers and prospective students alike. Apart from the enthusiasts among them, they have been tempted to regard technical education as like thepremises in which it is given something second rate in some obscure by-way and not of the same importance as what goes on in a secondary school,a factory or an office with modern, up-to-date premises.124. But that opinion is belied by the quality of the work done in thesecentres and the record of their achievements in various examinations. Theycomplement what is done in the central institutions by providing courses for ordinary National Certificates in some cases even Higher NationalCertificates the certificates of the City and Guilds of London Institute,and courses of a practical craft and workshop nature. In addition they providefull-time pre-apprenticeship or pre-vocational courses to prepare boys and girls leaving school at fifteen for the trade they wish to enter. In these courses,which generally last one year, the time is divided equally between subjects ofgeneral education and the fundamentals of technical subjects on the one handand practical work on the other. They cover a wide variety of occupations principally building, engineering, commercial subjects and nursing.125. The latest feature of technical education the day-release classwhereby the young worker spends one day of his working week receivinginstruction and training in the fundamentals of technical work at an educa-tional establishment, while during the other four or five he is learning practicalwork in the factory has been developed in the local technical colleges aswell as in the central institutions. Although the increase in the figures from600 in 1939, to 5,000 in 1946, 20,000 in 1951, and 25,500 in 1954-1955represents substantial progress, development has not been as rapid or as farreaching as it ought to have been or as it has been in England where 355,000young people were released from their employment in 1954-1955. It is significant also that of the 1954-1955 Scottish total, just over 15,000 werebetween the ages of fifteen and eighteen, or only 9 per cent, of the total
numbers in these age groups. The development is also uneven as between different industries as appears from the following table:  TABLE VEDUCATIONAL YEAR 1953-54STUDENTS &quot; RELEASED &quot; FROM INDUSTRY-SCOTLANDBoys and girls aged under 18 years released by their employers to attend courses for part-timeeducation shown as a percentage of the estimated number aged under 18 years who areinsured under the National Insurance Acts.Industry	Estimated numbers employed at end of May*	Numbers released by employers during year	Numbers released as per cent, of numbers insuredMining and Quarrying	6,210	2,992	48Public   Administration   and   Local   Authority			services	2,890	1,389	48Chemicals and allied trades        ...      ...	1,840	702	38Building and Contracting ...	13,030	2,663	20Engineering, Metal Manufacture, Metal Goods			and Vehicles      ...      ...	28,940	4,572	16Other   Manufacturing  Industries   (including			Leather, Wood and Cork, Precision Instruments,			Treatment of Non-Metalliferous Mining Pro-			ducts)      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...	7,580	795	10Miscellaneous       ......	10,360	389	4Paper and Printing......      ...      ......	6,300	203	3Distributive Trades...	38,550	1,095	3Textiles and Clothing       ............	23,840	430	2Food, Drink and Tobacco............	11,140	25	transport	6,580	13	1Insurance, Banking and Finance and Professional			services	9,100	56	1Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing	9,640	2	 Total  ......      ...      .........	176,000	15,326	9* Figures supplied by Ministry of Labour and National Service.Bursary Assistance126. Students wishing to take advantage of any of the facilities described above may obtain assistance from public funds through education authorities,who award bursaries in accordance with Regulations made by the secretary or State for practically all forms of further education. These awards includenot only those tenable at university, central institution, teachers&apos; trainingcollege of further education centre, but also pre-vocational bursaries (awardedfor pre-apprenticeship courses and courses of a similar type) and apprentices&apos;bursaries (awarded for courses undertaken during periods of release from employment). In addition, bursaries for the payment of fees, for subsistenceif necessary, and for books and instruments may be awarded to evening classstudents.127. Education authorities will generally grant a bursary to any persons resident in their area who is qualified for admission to the course he desires to follow. In session 1954-1955, authorities made further education awardsincluding 13,779 whole-time and 1,446 part-time bursaries. Of the whole-timeawards, 5,111 were tenable in all faculties at universities, 2,786 in central institutions, and 2,833 in pre-apprenticeship courses ; while of the part-timeawards, 1,183 were tenable at central institutions and further education centres.
Aid from Industry128. Parallel with the financial aid available from bursary funds and ofno less importance is that given by employers. In the case of evening classes,most employers pay class fees, and in the case of day-release classes theypay wages and fees. A few employers who send selected students to sandwichor other full-time courses at an advanced level are willing to continue to paywages and to meet tuition expenses. The Government regard all such assistance as valuable both to the student and to his firm and they hopethat many more firms will be encouraged to offer it in view of the nationalneed for more and better trained technologists and technicians.REGIONAL CO-OPERATION129. In the development of technical education in the West of scotland as the main centre of industry and population it was early found desirablethat there should be some means of liaison between local centres and central institutions and the courses they provide. The first step to secure this co-ordination was taken over 50 years ago when a Joint Committee for technical education was set up. It includes both educationists and industrialists andby devising schemes of work for various technical courses and by otherco-ordinating arrangements the Committee has done much to ensure uniformstandards throughout all the centres within its ambit. It has thus stimulatedthe expansion and has raised the standard of technical education in the west of Scotland by linking centres of varied types and status with the central institutions. The success of this machinery has led to the establishment inthe south-eastern and north-eastern regions of Scotland of similar Committeeswho have begun to work on the same lines as those followed in the West ofScotland.130. Another more recent step towards securing a closer welding of technical education was the establishment in 1948 by statutory order underthe Education (Scotland) Acts, of five Regional Advisory Councils for technical Education covering between them the whole of Scotland. Theseare designed to extend and facilitate the co-operation of education andindustry in the development of technical education. These interests havealready co-operated on the governing bodies of central institutions, and manyeducation authorities have local advisory committees for different trades toadvise them on particular courses. But the purpose of the new RegionalCouncil is to bring together representatives of education and of both sides of industry in the respective regions so that they may jointly advise educationauthorities and other managers of educational establishments on the develop-ment of technical education in the region. By this means technical educationsecures the full and practical support of industry, and education authoritiesand central institutions obtain authoritative advice from a regional body toassist them in considering the provision of new facilities. Representatives ofthe five Councils meet annually to discuss important matters requiringconsideration from a national point of view.SURVEY OF PROGRESS131. How has this structure of technical education served Scotland in thepast? Scotland&apos;s pride in the academic traditions of her educational systemmay have tended to overshadow her achievements in technical education.But these achievements have contributed in no small measure to the renownof her engineering skill throughout the world in the past half century. the foundations of these successes have lain just as much in her technical colleges and evening schools as in the shipyards and factories.  That these and similar
further education establishments have hitherto proved capable of expandingto meet the increasing demands made upon them is shown by the followingtable of the number of further education students between 1938 and 1954 : TABLE VINUMBER OF STUDENTS IN FURTHER EDUCATION-SCOTLANDthousands	1937-38	1946-47	1954-55Full-time......	5	9	10Part-time day   ...	3	9	25Evening only	174	180	206Totals     ......	182	198	241132. But these establishments are only part of the wider system of higher education in Scotland. Table VII below illustrates the proportions of thevarious age-groups following the different forms of post-school education:  TABLE VIIEstimated number of persons in Scotland between fifteen and twenty receiving different forms of education expressed as a percentage of each age group in 1953-54*				Central Institutions and					Teacher	Further Education		Age	Schools	Universities	Training	Centresf		Total			Colleges							Full-time	Part-time	Boys						20	 	5-5	0 1	11	18-7	25-419	. .	4-3	0-1	10	26-2	31-618	1-2	2-9	01	0-8	35-6	40-617	8-1	1-3	 	1-3	39-9	50-616	13 0	 	 	31	30-8	46-915	23-2	-	 	2-5	12-6	38-3Girls						20	 	2-6	1-4	1-2	9-7	14-919	 	2-3	1-4	1-6	12-4	17-718	0-6	1-6	1-8	1-7	17-8	23-517	6-2	0-8		1-9	21-7	30-616	12-3	 	. 	2-8	20-3	35-415	22-7	 	 	1-5	10-2	34-4* School figures are for January, 1955.

Percentages other than (1) are related to the estimated populationDecember, 1953.f These statistics refer only to students who took a progressive course of study in one ormore subjects.&apos; 133. When the large contribution of the Scottish universities to theproduction of technologists is included the technological departments ofthese universities and the courses at the Royal Technical College contain no less than one-fifth of the full-time students following graduating courses intechnology in the whole of the United Kingdom. At other levels, thenumbers of enrolments in evening courses of a technical kind is (at 54,000)greater than at any other time in the history of technical education.134. Nor is the success of the system to be measured only in figures.Whatever virtues it may lack, it possesses one of the most precious virtuesin any educational system flexibility. It can be entered by many doors, andat many stages; and young people can work their way through it as faras their ability will allow.
135. But if there is much in the development of our system of technical education that is creditable, there is no ground for complacency. the foundations appear to be sound and well able to carry the extensions andadaptations which we must make in our structure to enable it to meet thestill greater demands it will have to face in this new scientific and technologicalage. As has been indicated, the main strength of Scotland&apos;s system of technical education has lain in its more traditional features the comparativelyhigh proportion of students embarking on under-graduate and similar full-time courses, and the maintenance of evening class numbers. In the newerdevelopments in technical education the pre-apprenticeship classes and theday-release class her record is less satisfactory. While therefore we mustdevelop to the utmost those aspects in which we are strong, we must alsobecome strong where we are at present weak. Much will require to bedone by all concerned with technical education the Government, educationauthorities, both sides of industry, parents and young people if it is tomeet the needs of the new age for an ever wider variety of courses and thetraining of ever increasing numbers of students at all levels.PLANS FOR THE FUTURE136. On its side the Government is determined to ensure that the facilities are provided which will permit of a substantial increase in the numbers of trained people required by industry, whether at the level of the technologist,the technician or the craftsman. This will entail developments at Scottishuniversities, central institutions and local technical colleges. To make possible the advance at the central institutions and local technical colleges,to which university expansion will be additional, it is the Governments aim to have a huilding programme of a capital value approaching  10 (m) startedWithin five years.UNIVERSITIES AND CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS137. The universities and central institutions are the sources of supply oftechnologists for the most advanced forms of work. The governments plans for the development of higher technological education at universitylevel throughout the United Kingdom are referred to elsewhere in this Paper.In these, Scotland plays a prominent part. In Glasgow, the University andthe Royal Technical College in association form one of the main centresspecially selected for major development and extension. Great developments have already been launched there. At the University, a building programmeof  2 (m) has been completed since the war, the great part of it for scientific and technological work. A further major building project for a modernengineering building costing over  \ (m) has been begun. At the RoyalTechnical College a large extension providing accommodation for the mechanical, civil, chemical and mining engineering departments is nearing completion at a cost of about  1 (m). A further extension costing aboutSL\ (m) has just been begun, and land has been acquired for still furtherbuilding. A residential centre for management studies the first of its kind to be opened in the United Kingdom as part of educational institution was recently established and is to be further extended. In Edinburgh, the Heriot-Watt College is pressing ahead with developments on a smaller scale but of equal importance. In conjunction with the University, a department inthe important subject of chemical engineering has been established, and a building extension costing nearly SL\ (m) is in progress, with other smallerextensions in prospect.
138. At all the central institutions, despite steady extension of buildingsover many years, over-crowding persists and many buildings are ill-designed and unsuited to the requirements of modern technological studies. substantial improvements have been made in recent years. Further projects have beenapproved. Others are being prepared for approval. Tribute is due to themaintenance by the Scottish industry of its traditional support of the provisionof the advanced levels of technical education. Large sums of money havebeen contributed or have been promised for the new buildings and equipmentat various central institutions. To these contributions are added capital grants from the Education (Scotland) Fund to cover the cost of the developments.139. With regard to revenue, special grant arrangements have been made so that the Secretary of State may make such payments as he thinks fit beyondthe normal 60 per cent, grant to enable the colleges to meet the heavy costof maintaining first-class facilities.140. Coupled with this building development, attention is constantly devotedto the development of new facilities and courses at all the central institutions.The diploma and associateship courses are under review to ensure that theykeep pace with the needs of modern industry, and in this review the possibilityof extending the use of sandwich courses occupies a prominent place. Inaddition, the Regional Advisory Councils have been asked to consider thegeneral problem of the extent to which that type of course might be usefullyextended to&apos; other levels of training.LOCAL TECHNICAL COLLEGESTransfer of courses141. The great need in Scotland is, however, for better provision for thetechnical education appropriate to the local technical colleges run by educationauthorities. Emphasis has been laid on the need for relieving the central institutions of the more elementary courses to allow them to extend thenumber of places available there for more advanced work and to re-arrangetheir curricula to provide a still greater variety of courses. For reasons already indicated, the process of transfer from the central institutions to these localcolleges has been slow. Only in Glasgow has striking progress been possible.There the Royal Technical College has divested itself almost entirely ofwork of sub-university standard. Elsewhere much still requires to be done before the central institutions will be able to devote themselves solely tothe more advanced level of training.142. Education authorities must therefore expand their facilities substan-tially in order to train in large numbers the technicians on whom industryis going to rely more and more in the future if full advantage is to be taken ofthe ideas of our scientists and technologists. In the new provision whicheducation authorities will have to make, pre-apprenticeship and day-releasecourses must play an increasing part.Pre-apprenticeship and day-release courses143. Alongside the effort thus required from education authorities, both employers and trade unions in industry will have to keep in mind thatpre-apprenticeship and day-release courses are modern forms of technical education which experience in other countries suggests are pre-requisites ofsuccess in the modern science-based industries. The development of pre-apprenticeship courses would be stimulated if substantial remission of theapprenticeship period could be given for time spent in taking the classes-
here the trade unions have great responsibilities-and if employers wouldgive due weight when engaging apprentices to the value of this sound trainingin the fundamentals of their trade. Part-time day education, as comparedwith evening classes, is to be preferred both educationally in the short term and from the point of view of industrial efficiency in the long term. Tothe present figures for day-release in Scotland already quoted, at least afurther 15,000 students will be needed if Scotland is to attain proportionatelythe same number of day-release students as there is already in England, andmore if she is to keep in step with expansion there. Factors of geography,population and industrial structure account in part for the disparity whichhas hitherto existed between the two countries. But the essential factoris the full co-operation of all concerned education authorities in providingfacilities and both sides of industry, especially the employers, in releasingboys and encouraging their interest. Every effort will be made to fosterthis co-operation through the Regional Advisory Councils and otherwise.As part of the plans to stimulate technical education, these Councils have just been reconstituted, with both the industrial and educational elementsstrengthened.Provision of Craft Courses144. One need which must receive attention at this level of technical education is to devise courses with a high practical content suitable forboys who are not fitted for much theoretical work. In the present courses,such as those leading to the Ordinary National Certificate or the City andGuilds examinations, in which a substantial element of theory is included,the high degree of wastage is disturbing. Large numbers of students whoembark on the courses are sooner or later found&quot; to be ill equipped to obtainfull benefit from them. Hitherto, alternative practical courses designed toimprove their attainments as craftsmen have not been often available. Thedevelopment of this type of course is, therefore, being encouraged. Not onlywill this result in the reduction of wastage in the theoretical courses, butin a marked improvement in the standards of craftsmanship in industry.Buildings and Teachers145. This expansion of the responsibilities of education authorities in thefield-of technical education will require a major building effort by theauthorities to make good the slow progress in providing such facilities inthe past. A start has already been made by one education authority withthe building of the first entirely new local technical college to be provided in Scotland since the war. Ten others, mainly in the industrial areas, havehad projects approved or have them at various stages of preparation.146. A major increase in recruitment of teachers will also be required as facilities expand, mainly to man the new local technical colleges. Thereare 1,150 full-time and 6,100 part-time teachers in central institutions andtechnical colleges and these numbers will have to be substantially increasedwhen the new colleges are working to capacity. The teaching staffs are; recruited from two sources. One is the teaching profession. The new scales of salary for full-time teachers of further education in Scotland, which took account of the special needs and conditions in further education, arealready proving a successful stimulus to recruitment to this work. Thetransfer of teachers to the technical colleges from the schools may furtherbe eased to some extent when the &quot; bulge &quot; has passed out of the schools.Industry has proved an equally valuable source of recruitment of both full-time and part-time teachers. It is hoped that industry will, in view of thegreat need for and advantages of expansion of technical education, be willing
to release many more staff qualified to teach and that more and more ofthose who undertake part-time teaching will, as the need increases, be encouraged to become full-time teachers.147. Much is already done by part-time or short vacation courses to equipteachers in further education, whether recruited from the profession or from industry, for the special requirements of that work. Considerable developmentof this form of training will be necessary as more teachers are recruited from industry. For those entering teaching direct from university or college, theestablishment of new training courses specially designed to fit them to engage in further education will be considered as part of the forthcoming reviewof teacher training in Scotland.FURTHER EDUCATION FOR GIRLS148. As in England, the further education of girls raises special problems.Too often further education particularly part-time -is regarded as importantonly for boys. But it is desirable not only in the interests of the girlsthemselves but in the national interest that they should have equal oppor-tunities with boys, and should take every advantage of these opportunities,to carry their education and training to as advanced a standard as possible.On the vocational side, they will thus be better equipped to do their particularjob more efficiently in the days when they are in employment. On the personal side, they will have a better general education which will enablethem to lead a full life in their leisure from employment and make the mall the more fitted to carry out at a later stage that most important function of all, which the great majority of them will be called upon to undertake the foundation of a home and a family.149. The need for developing further education for girls is shown by thefact that only one girl in five takes any form of further education at all even at the age when such education is generally most popular. At the pre-vocational stage, demand is concentrated on courses for nursing, home craft,and secretarial subjects. Demand among girls for day-release courses is limited very largely to commercial and general subjects, distributive trades,clothing and textiles, hairdressing and nursing.150. Much therefore remains to be done to stimulate among girls a greaterdemand for further education generally, even to bring the numbers up towhat they should be in courses linked with what are traditionally regardedas girls&apos; careers. But an even greater problem confronts us in tapping theresources of talent and labour available among girls in order to- swell thenumbers of trained personnel needed for the more strictly technical occupa-tions. There is no doubt that at present much talent is lost to industry at both advanced and craft levels because the resources of technical and scientific ability among girls are not drawn on as they might be. It is truethat some of the courses already taken by girls such as those concernedwith textiles and nursing, have a considerable technical or science content.At the level of technology, only a few girls take engineering subjects, butnumbers of girls take science subjects. In 1954 more than 15 per cent, ofthe students gaining their National Certificates in chemistry and appliedphysics were girls. In pharmacy, too, 40 per cent, of those who took their qualifications in 1954 were girls.151. But we must do much more than this if we are to succeed in the drive to train the technicians and technologists we need. A new outlookamong parents and in schools on the careers which are open to girls isrequired, so that those with a practical or scientific bent can be encouraged to grasp the opportunities open to girls as well as to boys.   Education
authorities and the governors of central institutions might well consider what they should do to encourage a greater demand for technical trainingamong girls; they might establish special courses for girls in particular industries and set aside special classes in technical colleges for girls only.More employers, particularly. in the new light industries, might considerrecruiting girl technicians and training them on the job. Those who alreadydo so have found the girls more nimble with their hands at particular kinds of work and no less quick to pick up technical processes. In these ways and by the exercise of foresight and imagination on the part of parents,industry and education, much can be done to provide worthwhile careersfor women while assisting in the recruitment of trained people for industry.PROGRAMME OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE152. All the developments on the foregoing lines at both central institutions and Technical Colleges involve a large-scale programme of capitalexpenditure. It will be a major aim of Government policy over the next five years to ensure that the necessary resources are available. The Govern-ment are ready to authorise a programme of buildings for technical education to be started within the next five years to the value of  10 million, with afurther  2 million for the necessary equipment. How far this programmecan be realised will depend largely on how soon education authorities canexpedite their local technical college projects. The Government look to theauthorities to bring forward as quickly as possible all such projects whichthey have had in mind for the future. For these projects alone  6 million of the  10 million will be required. The Government will look to theauthorities further to start within the period such additional projects as may prove to be within their compass and in this way to make full use of thetotal resources available.153. The Secretary of State intends forthwith to discuss with the authorities concerned how progress can best be made on the projects already underconsideration and how soon further projects can be undertaken.CHAPTER VCONCLUSION154. Success is carrying out the plans set out in this Paper depends onattracting many more students and placing them in the right courses, and ontheir own willingness to work hard and go through with their studies. Allthese are human problems, closely related to the students background.155. Many enquiries in secondary schools have shown that again and againa good home accounts for the widely different rates of progress made bychildren between whom there was nothing to choose at the age of eleven.Parents easily over-estimate what formal education can do for their children and under-estimate their own influence, be it for good or evil. As soon aseducation becomes voluntary, as it does at the age of fifteen, there is a crucialdecision to be taken. Sometimes it is the boy or girl who takes it, but more often than not what the family and the neighbours think about continuing to study determines the decision. If mother and father cannot see the advantageof further education, it is a brave child who goes against their wishes.156. Every effort must be made, therefore, to win the support of parentsfor further education. The schools and technical colleges are fully alive tothis need, and through personal contacts and parents&apos; associations steady
progress is being made. The campaign by our leading firms, in the national press and by visits and conferences, to illustrate the careers open to boys and girls has done much to stir up interest in the schools in the future of Britishindustry.157. The good firm is the ally of the good home, and. if a boy comes froma home hostile to further education, his firm is his lifeline. Both sides ofindustry, speaking through their official representatives, fully recognise this responsibility. Managers and trade union leaders who sit on many bodies concerned with education have been insistent that the Government shouldexpand technical education. In accepting this advice the Government nowlook to the individual employer and trade union leader to give all the prac-tical help they can to make the new plans a success. The more representa-tives of industry get to know the colleges, the better. They are already helping the colleges in many ways: by acting as members of regional bodies andgoverning bodies of colleges and as part-time teachers. They can be ofparticular service by taking an interest in the working out of new courses and the drawing up of building programmes. It is greatly to be hoped that more and more of the leading men and women on both sides of industry willgive some of their time to the problems of further education. They can besure that their interest and example will always have a most stimulatingeffect upon the colleges.158. In the end it is the attitude of individual firms to further educationwhich will count most. The Government hope ail employers will considerevery young worker as someone who still has to find his or her feet in theworld and for whose education and character the employer bears a respon-sibility second only to that of parents. Many private firms and the nation-nationalised industries, in spite of the present shortage of labour, go out of their way to encourage their young workers to improve their qualifications. Somelarge firms have established works schools in which vocational and generaleducation is given to apprentices from whom the most able are chosen foradvanced courses at a university or technical college. Others rely for tech-nical education wholly on the colleges and among these are the strongestadvocates for the expansion of the facilities available today. Small firms findgreater difficulty in providing opportunities for young people owing partly to the restricted scope of their work, and partly to the -problem of releasingapprentices when the total number in a shop is small. The spread of groupapprenticeship schemes designed for small firms will go some way towardsovercoming these difficulties. It is likely to increase the number of apprentice-tices and correspondingly increase the requirements for part-time day facilities in technical colleges.159. Finally, there is the general public. How are we to get their full support for our plans which must cost a great deal of money? The old idea that advanced education is good only for a small selection of the people isdead. The management, of full employment, with its much greater need fora responsible attitude to work and its challenge to greater output per manas the only way further to raise living standards, has brought a sense of oue independence on education as the key to advance. Everyone can now see thevalue of giving all children, wherever they come from and whatever their financial circumstances, the best possible chance to develop their own talentsand contribute to the national well-being. Technical education must bebrought within the reach of all in this country and offered generously tothose from overseas. The Government are confident that this task will beundertaken willingly by the nation.
APPENDIX- ANOTE ON THE U.S.A., THE U.S.S.R. AND WESTERN europe in this appendix are set out some of the available figures and facts about theoutput of technical manpower in certain foreign countries. Comparisons between countries in this field are hard to make, and are necessarily unreliable for several reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to be sure of the facts. Secondly, systems ofeducation, and of employment of technical manpower, vary very greatly between different countries; this makes it almost impossible to equate with any certaintythe standards of attainment represented by the different degrees, diplomas, certifi-cates, etc. Thirdly, even the meaning of the different categories technologists,technicians and craftsmen (defined for the purposes of this White Paper on page 1) varies from country to country. Moreover, a comparison of the position atone point in time is misleading unless regard is also had to the trends over a period.2. Even within this country there is such a wide range of technical qualificationsthat there is ample room for argument about which qualification should beincluded in which category. Moreover, many craftsmen and some technicians aretrained solely on the job and do not figure in any statistical returns. The difficultyof making comparisons is less severe in the ease of the highest category &quot;broadly speaking, technologists. This appendix is therefore concerned mainly with them.Though they constitute a relatively small proportion of a country&apos;s technicalmanpower, their numbers give quite a good indication of the scale of its efforts in technical education.Great Britain3. As indicated in paragraphs 50 and 56 of the White Paper, this country, witha population of close on 50 million, produced in 1954:2,800 University graduates in the engineering and other applied sciences(or holders of diplomas awarded at universities) 57 per million of the popula-tion. Some 2,300 of these students obtained their qualifications by three orfour years&apos; full time study at universities the rest by full time or part timestudy at technical colleges.8,100 holders of Higher National Certificates (or broadly equivalent qualifi-cations) 164 per million of the population. These qualifications were obtained largely by part time study at technical colleges. Their holdersrange from those, possibly rather less than one half, who eventually become members of Professional Institutions to others who should be classed as highgrade technicians.4. No comparable figures are available for those with lower qualifications.Their numbers have undoubtedly increased substantially since 1945, but not enough to keep pace with the demand.U.S.A.5. In the U.S.A., with a population of 162 million, there are a large number ofinstitutions of university status which train engineers. There were produced from them, in 1954, a total of:22,000 engineering graduates 134 per million of the population. This was less than half the output of 50,000 in 1950, when the age groups were larger and the total was swollen by ex-servicemen. The Americans estimate thatthe number will rise to 43,000 by 1964, following the bulge in the post-warbirth rate.6. The university courses leading to a bachelors degree in engineering in theU.S.A. usually last four years, but generally start from a lower standard thanthat of the normal entry to our universities. .. The standard of the U.S. Colleges,and of the. engineering graduates produced from them, varies greatly. ManyAmerican bachelor degrees are,, in technical subjects, little if any higher than thestandard of the High National Certificate, but a considerable number of Americangraduates proceed to higher degrees.
&apos;( &apos; )i &apos; - tea7. Technicians in the United States come from three sources: holders of bachelordegrees, students.who spend one or two years at a university without attempting a degree, technicians trained by a number of &quot; technical institutes&quot; and otherstrained on the job. Figures of the total output of technicians are not available,but it is authoritatively stated to be inadequate to supply the &quot;three to fiveengineering aides&quot; who are considered necessary to support every professionalengineer.8. The American authorities are known to be disturbed about the present outputof both technologists and technicians and are understood to be anxious to expand it considerably. They are however faced with a very serious shortageof science teachers in the schools.U.S*S.R*9. The following information is taken from &quot; Soviet Professional Manpower &quot;,a study published in 1955 by Mr. Nicholas de Witt of Harvard University. he says that the figures quoted are mostly estimates, compiled from a variety ofsources, but carefully cross-checked ; they have been accepted by the UnitedStates National Science Foundation.10. With a population of 214 million, the U.S.S.R. claim to be producingper annum:60,000 &quot; professional engineers&quot; 280 per million of the population.These qualify after courses of 5\ years at &quot; specialist institutes &quot;, where thestandard is said to be high.70,000 engineers 326 per million of the population, at the &quot; Technicums &quot;.These provide a four year course for students about half of whom havealready had ten years schooling. The other half enter the &quot; Technicum &quot;at the age of fourteen, after only 7 years at school. The official aim is to limit the entry to &quot; Technicums &quot; to boys and girls who have had ten years at school..11. The Russians are clearly determined to produce the maximum number of scientists and technologists, and have announced a target of a 50 per cent, increasein the number of professional engineers. The general conclusion of a numberof observers from this country who have visited Russia recently, as well as thatof Mr. de Witt, is that the standard of Russian scientific and technological education is high. The numbers of engineers turned out are well ahead of anyother country, both in absolute figures and per head of population. This is achieved in part by what some American observers described as a ruthlesssacrifice of the arts though the schooling of scientists and technologists is by no means narrow. Both in salaries and in other privileges, the careers of scientists, and technologists are made very attractive. Moreover, there is farlarger use of woman-power in Russia than in any other country ; for example,about three-quarters of the medical doctors, and one quarter of the engineers,are women.Western Europe12. In Western Europe (except in Italy) the majority of professional engineersare trained in specialised technical institutes of university status such as thewell-known &quot; Grandes Ecoles &quot; of France and the &quot; Technische Hochschulen &quot;in Germany, Holland and Switzerland. The entrance requirements for these; institutes are generally high, though broadly based, and the length of the course is usually four to five years and sometimes longer. The graduates from sUchinstitutes will thus in general have received more advanced technological trainingthan is possible in the three year university course in Britain.13. In addition, many countries have technical schools of a slightly lower status,such as the Dutch &quot; Middelbare Technische Scholen&quot; and the German&quot; Fachschulen&quot;. Unfortunately no comprehensive figures are available of thenumbers trained in such schools, but the standard reached is thought to correspondvery roughly with our Higher National Certificate. The Colleges are mainlyfull-time, and the course lasts some three-years.
. 14. Figures for the output in 1953 of technologists (and also of pure scientists)in Western European countries (other than Western Germany), have been obtained through a questionnaire issued by the Organisation for European economic co-operation, and the results have recently been published. The figures give atotal output for France, Italy, Western Germany (estimated), Switzerland,Scandinavia and the Low Countries in 1953 of:12,054 graduates in technology largely educated at the specialisedtechnical institutions mentioned above. This figure is equivalent to 67 permillion of the population, the figures for France, Western Germany,Switzerland and Italy being respectively: 70, 86, 82 and 39. These figuresexclude students trained in technical colleges or engineering schools.15. By way of contrast, the O.E.E.C. returns show that theses countries produce,proportionately to the population, less than half the graduates in pure scienceproduced in Great Britain (many of whom go into industry). The figure for western Europe as a whole is 48 per million of the population, compared withour figure of 105 ; the Russian figure is 56. The relative importance which thesecountries attach to engineering is in itself instructive, and the standards achieved by the specialist institutes of technology in which most of these continentalengineers are educated, set examples of quality which cannot be ignored.APPENDIX BNATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON EDUCATION FOR INDUSTRYAND COMMERCEREPORT ON SANDWICH TRAINING AND education. The National Advisory Council have had under consideration for sometime past the sandwich system of education and industrial training in whichsubstantial full-time periods are given alternately to education and to trainingin industry, and the question of securing a greater degree of interest and co-operation by industry in the development of such courses as a step towardsremedying the deficiency of technologists trained to professional level. RegionalAdvisory Councils have been consulted and discussions have been held withrepresentatives of industry and everywhere the Council finds support for itsview that all necessary steps should be taken for the development of sandwichcourses and particularly of those leading to a high standard of professionaltraining.2. Sandwich courses are already in being at a number of technical colleges and these range from courses covering a period of 2 years leading to theOrdinary National Diploma to courses covering 4 to 5 years leading to theHigher National Diploma and College Associateships. Increasing interest hasbeen shown in this kind of provision during the past twelve months and thisstirring of interest is no doubt due to the discussions taking place both regionallyand centrally which have resulted in a wider, though still limited, knowledge ofthe sandwich system and the opportunities it offers.3. The National Advisory Council support the sandwich system of organisationof courses at all appropriate levels. They are, however, most strongly impressed with the opportunity which the system offers of developing schemes for training to professional level school leavers and other young people with ability tobecome professional engineers and technologists capable of filling responsibleposts in industry. In view of the urgent need to increase the supply of engineers and technologists of this calibre there can be little room for doubt about thevalue of a system which provides another and complementary method of training to that whereby a young man undertakes a university course together with two years&apos; apprenticeship dn industry, and which is particularly suited to thosewho wish to enter industry direct from school and who would benefit fromstudies being closely related to industrial experience.
4. The Council have considered carefully the principles that need to be followed in the development of professional type sandwich courses in technical colleges and they offer the following observations and recommendations for the Ministersattention.5. The professional type of sandwich course should normally cover a periodof 4 to 5 years for selected students and should be of such a standard that itmay be expected to satisfy the requirement for the new technological award tobe administered by the Council over which Lord Hives presides. Students may now look to this new award for recognition of the successful completion of high standard courses such as these and industry will have a measure of the quality of training and the level of ability of young people who attain this qualification.6. While maintaining this standard, the content of the courses can be variedto meet particular technological and industrial needs and it is an essential feature of sandwich training that there must be close co-operation between the college and the industrial organisation concerned in the formulation and design of the course and the plans for linking college education and industrial trainingin the most effective way. In general, however, the emphasis should be on training people to think and developing a critical mind. This can probablybest be achieved by stressing fundamental science and study in the art ofcommunication. One aim of the courses should be to produce an awarenessof the importance of human relations and of management techniques. In viewof the importance of developing cost consciousness, some attention should alsobe given to the principles of economics. Opportunity for the students to livetogether as a community is most desirable.7. The staffing of courses of this kind will of course, present new problems,for the colleges will not only need full-time staff of high quality but otherspecialist lecturers to provide part-time services during the day-time. It isessential, therefore, for industry to co-operate fully with the colleges in providingsuch specialists.8. There is evidence that periods of 5 months in the college and 7 months in the works or of about six months in each will normally be the most effective and convenient arrangements, but where these arrangements are found to present difficulties other periods can be adopted having regard to the needs of theparticular industry and the need to even the load both in the college and in theworks.9. It is important that the college should maintain contact with the studentsduring their works periods. Such contact might take the form of tutorial classesor guided studies.10. The selection of students for this type of course needs particular care and the firm and the college should collaborate in selecting those entrants withthe aptitude, ability and personal qualities necessary both for undertaking thetraining and proceeding to posts of responsibility. The several sources of recruitsseem to be(d) young people leaving school at 18 with two appropriate advanced levelpasses in the General Certificate of Education ;(b) selected  employees  who  have  obtained  a  good  Ordinary  NationalCertificate, and(c) young people with appropriate passes at ordinary level in the GeneralCertificate of Education who have been given a suitable preliminary orintroductory course.11. With large firms the groups may be big enough in each case to justifyspecial provision and there should be no difficulty in securing satisfactory trainingduring the works periods. In the case of medium sized firms there will be a nucleus of students available to enable students from smaller firms to completea class. It may be desirable, however, for the college to arrange with a largerfirm for some of the training facilities for those attending from the smaller firms.There may be a need to organise college based courses for students enteringupon training before taking up employment in industry. These may either joinup with works based students during the college periods or, if they are sufficient
ia number, form groups of their own. In either case it is hoped that firms will-operate in assisting the college to provide satisfactory training facilities duringthe works periods ; and furthermore, that when the employers have had theopportunity of seeing the college based students during the first period in theworks they may then be prepared to sponsor them as works based students. Themain consideration is that industrial training should be broad and closely related to the education in the college, whether the students are works based or collegebased.12. It is believed that the essential co-operation between the firms and colleges,both in the selection of the students and in their training, is greatly facilitatedwhen firms sponsor their students during the whole of the period of training,whether in the college or works and pay their wages and college fees. Thisarrangement is already widely accepted by many firms which co-operate inthis kind of training, for they have found that it fosters loyalty on the partof the students towards their employers and acts as a considerable stimulus torecruitment.Not all firms may be in a position to help deserving students to the efullest extent required. In such cases suitable students should be able to look to localeducation authorities for adequate assistance, according to their needs. As theseare courses of professional level, the students should be eligible for assistance on a similar basis to students going to university. Further, those who havethe necessary ability and intend to pursue courses of sufficiently high level willhave the opportunity to apply for Technical State Scholarships.13. The Council understand that it is the normal policy of the Ministry torequire student fees to be charged for courses of all kinds although provision is made for remission in cases of hardship. They feel that there are soundreasons why the normal policy should be followed in the case of sandwichcourses. The fees charged by local education authorities are not economic fees and represent only a fraction of the actual cost to the authority of the provisionit makes.14. There should be the fullest regional consultation before new courses ofthis kind are started so as (a) to avoid duplication and consequent uneconomicuse of staff and facilities and (b) to ensure that courses are located at centreswhich can best provide them in a proper environment and which offer suitableopportunities of continued contact between the firms, the colleges and the students.On the other hand it is essential for regional machinery to work promptly soas not to prejudice the negotiations between industry and the colleges or delay the establishment of courses.15. It is an essential pre-requisite for the development of professional sandwichcourses that local education authorities should plan out-county arrangements on a free trade basis especially where the courses are works based. Thus if a firm arranges with a particular college for a sandwich course to be providedfor selected employees who may come from a wide area each local educationauthority should accept without question responsibility for the appropriate inter-autihority payment in respect of such of its own students as are accepted for admission to the course.16. Where firms have factories in different parts of the country it will often be beneficial for students to go to Che different factories in turn for their industrial training and it is understood that in those cases where the firm certifies that suoharrangements are being made, the student would not be regarded as belongingto the area of any one authority and consequently the pooling arrangements would operated17. Finally, the National Advisory Council believe that this method of pro-viding the country with more technologists should be widely advertised as an* Note. Under the Local Education Authorities Recoupment (Further Education)Regulation, 1954, the full cost (less fees and main grant) of providing further education forstudents not regarded as belonging to the area of any local education authority is met froma central &quot; pool &quot; to which all authorities contribute.
additional means towards meeting a requirement that ds vital to industry and,in fact, to the nation. The Council is aware that certain sections of industry are already cooperating in the development of sandwich courses but the temposhould be quickened and the negotiations which the Ministry is conducting atthe national level with industry should be supplemented by similar discussions atthe regional level. It is hoped that this will be facilitated by arrangements whichare being discussed between the Ministry and the Federation of British Industries.Much of the success of these developments will depend on the ability of theMinistry ajjd iflhe local education authorities to provide facilities. Improvementsare required in the acooirnimodatdon and staffing at the technical colleges andmany colleges require hostels. The matter ds urgent and the National AdvisoryCouncil hope that the necessary capital investment will be made available for thispurpose.Signed on behalf of the Council,R. M.
