Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1956CONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 4924th February, 1956CABINETTHE TERRITORIAL army memorandum by the Secretary of State for WarI am most reluctant to bother the Cabinet with such a minor question, butI am in a position of considerable difficulty about a bounty for officers of theTerritorial Army.2. About December, 1955, a proposal was put to the Treasury that bothofficers and other ranks who were volunteers in the Territorial Army should havean annual bounty of  20. This proposal was accepted by the Treasury in principlebut it was suggested that officers should only be given  10 because they already had a messing grant of  10. The question was still under discussion when thestatement was made about the reorganisation of the Territorial Army. The matter was not mentioned in the House of Commons, but in the House of Lords LordFortescue, in reply to a supplementary question, stated that the Territorial officers&apos;bounty was being &quot; worked out.&quot;3. Since then the Chancellor of the Exchequer has reiterated that he canonly give an additional  10 for the officers&apos; bounty and that I must count themessing grant as the remaining  10. I cannot hope to convince any Territorialofficer of the equity of this proposal. First, the messing grant is never handled by the officer but goes straight to a central fund to pay messing expenses. Secondly,all Territorial Army officers, irrespective of whether they are volunteers or not,receive this allowance so that it can in no way be regarded as an extra given tothose who volunteer for this important duty.4. I have been repeatedly approached by the Chairman of the TerritorialArmy Associations and other prominent members about the necessity for givingofficers a bounty. If we are to retain a healthy Territorial Army which can runitself the volunteer officer is a vital necessity. We alone of all countries withconscription rely on a volunteer cadre to train our Territorial Army in a way which, compared to other nations, is &quot; on the cheap.&quot;5.   There are now three courses before me:  -(a) to give the officers no bounty; but this course is made difficult by LordFortescue&apos;s assurance in the House of Lords;(b) to give them only  10 as suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.This is entirely contrary to all precedent about pay or bounties, i.e..giving officers less than other ranks. I feel that this would cause greatill-will and do more harm than giving officers no bounty;(c) to give the officers the full  20.  This would cost about  110,000 per yearmore than the  10 bounty, and I would undertake to make equivalentsavings elsewhere in order to pay for it.6. I fully appreciate the Chancellors difficulties and the necessity for the strictest economy, but I see very great difficulty in adopting course (a) or (b)above.The War Office, S.W.1,23rd February, 1956.49613Copy No. 4 6A.
