L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,16th January, 1956.PROPOSALS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE VOTERS ATTHE REFERENDUM TO BE HELD ON11th AND 12th FEBRUARY, 1956The underlying principle of the Malta Labour Governments proposals for closer association with Great Britain on which negotiations will be conducted with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, is a complete equality of status between the two peoples. The proposals embody the following basicfeatures:  I. Constitutional1. Malta would have representatives with full voting powers in the parliament at Westminster, elected in the same way as Members in the United Kingdom.2. The Parliament at Westminster would have exclusive authority in mattersof defence and foreign affairs and, at an appropriate future date, direct taxation.3. The powers of the Maltese Parliament would be extended and wouldembrace all matters other than those mentioned in paragraph 2 above. the maltese Parliament would be responsible for legislation in all internal mattersincluding, in particular, those affecting the position of the Church in these Islands,education, marriage and family life, always acknowledging the principle of religious toleration as embodied in the Declaration of Rights of 1802 and in recentConstitutions.
