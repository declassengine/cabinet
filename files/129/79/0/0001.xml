THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1956SECRET Copy No-5iCP. (56) 12nd January, 1956CABINETTECHNOLOGICAL education memorandum by the Prime MinisterDuring the Recess I have been thinking over the problems of scientific and technological manpower and education, which are so vital to the future of thiscountry. I attach a note which Lord Cherwell prepared at my request. I thinkthat there is much to be said for his suggestion that this whole complex and difficult topic should be urgently reviewed for us by a small high-poweredcommittee, and should like the views of my colleagues upon this.A. E.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,1st January, 1956.
Note by Lord CherwellBritain will only be able to survive in the modern world if we can continueto sell at competitive prices manufactured goods equal in quality to those offered by other countries. We shall only be able to do this if our methods of production are better than those used by our competitors. If not, we shall have to consumeless or the labour force will have to work longer hours or harder.2. There is no need to stress the great shortage of scientists and technologistsin the United Kingdom. Government establishments, industry and schools alltell the same tale; indeed at least one large firm has been reduced to trying itselfto teach science to men with arts degrees after appointment.3. Russia with only about four times our population has some 300,000scientists and technologists in institutions of university status and a further,600,000 in institutions at least equal to our best technical colleges. Per head ofthe population we have only a fraction of these numbers in training.4. How to set about increasing greatly the number of scientists andtechnologists is a complicated problem. Owing to the shortage it is very difficult to attract good men to teach science, whereas first class arts men are often glad toaccept posts in schools. Moreover, the universities tend to give more scholarshipsfor arts subjects than for science, and the most intelligent boys are in consequenceinduced by the schools to compete for these. Thus the best brains tend to besteered away from science. Men with arts degrees are produced in excess by the universities and there is a dearth of scientists and technologists. Hence we findfew good science teachers and plenty of good arts teachers in the schools and thevicious circle is complete.5. Our technical colleges are, it seems, good some indeed very good;nevertheless they should be encouraged and perhaps further expanded. Buttechnical colleges only teach the non-commissioned officers of industry. What thecountry is really short of is what might be described as the officer class, the reall)highly trained technologists such as exist in large numbers in other countries wherethe applied scientists are trained in technological universities like MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, Zurich, Charlottenburg and so on. To produce anything like the number we need, technological universities of equal standard and statusshould be built up here. The Cabinet decided that this should be done more than three years ago.6. Since then, however, it has been argued that the available resources shouldbe used in the main to foster technology in the universities. Nobody would desireto abolish engineering teaching in universities; indeed there is no doubt a case for expanding and improving the teaching of the applied sciences there. But it isclear that only a fraction of the numbers we require can be produced in this way.7. People are all too apt to think that technology is just engineering. Butthis is only one of the branches. Besides civil engineering, mechanical engineering,heavy  electrical  and  light  electrical  engineering,  electronics   and  chemical
engineering, there are vast branches of technology concerned with textiles, plastics,ceramics, glass and the like which are all vital to industry. To teach these properlydozens of departments and scores of professors are required. And to superimposethese on to many of our universities would not only be vastly extravagant, but would throw the whole university out of balance. Every other civilised countrytrains the bulk of its technologists in great institutions of university status and rank,conferring degrees, including doctorates, and generally enjoying all the prestige and privileges of ordinary universities.8. If we are to have numbers comparable with the technologists trainedabroad, the great bulk will have to be educated in similar technological universitiesin which the emphasis is on the various forms of applied science without, of course,neglecting ancillary subjects such as economics, law and languages.9. In order to attract the best men it is vital that these institutions shouldhave absolutely equal rank with the universities. To ensure this they must betreated not like technical schools and colleges but like the ordinary universities,i.e., financed by the Treasury through a technological University Grants Committee.10. But the development of technological universities is only one aspect ofthe problem, though probably the most important. Of similar moment is theneed to increase and improve science teaching in the schools, which is partly theresponsibility of the Ministry of Education and partly the task of the independentschools which for a long time to come are likely to attract the best pupils. then there is the question of improving the technical colleges. And there is the very important matter of the relation of all these institutions to industry. None ofthese problems can be treated in isolation. The many possible solutions mustbe dovetailed together in one comprehensive overall plan.! 1. To produce the outlines of such a plan it would seem advisable to setup a very small high-powered committee like the one under Lord Waverley whichworked out in broad outline the best way of transferring atomic energy work from the Ministry of Supply to the Atomic Energy Authority. Like that committee it would report, at least in the first place, privately to the Government. It mightbe instructed by the Cabinet to outline a scheme for producing the large numbersof scientists and technologists the country needs, which will no doubt involve thecreation of special technological universities. Such a committee should be ableto report in two or three months.12. We have seen how quickly Germany with her army of technologists hasrecovered from the catastrophic damage inflicted by the war. Russia with herenormous man-power and vast mineral resources may well in 30 or 40 yearsovertake and even dominate the West if she is allowed to build up a similarpreponderance. Unless Britain takes speedy action she seems doomed to sinkin wealth and influence to the level of Portugal within a generation.28th December, 1955.
