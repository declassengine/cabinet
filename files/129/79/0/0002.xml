(55) 197 my colleagues were given a selection of texts of statements made by Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev in India and Burma. I now circulate,for the information of my colleagues, a selection of excerpts from the speechesmade by the two Soviet leaders since their return to Moscow.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,2nd January, 1956.ANNEXEXCERPTS FROM STATEMENTS BY MR. BULGANIN ANDMR. KHRUSHCHEV AT MOSCOW AIRPORT ON21st DECEMBER AND TO THE SUPREMESOVIET ON 29th DECEMBER1. Mr. Bulganin&apos;s speech at Moscow Airport on 21st December. Text taken fromSoviet News published in London by the Soviet Embassy.&quot; Not everyone seems to like this, however. Our trip and our statements,particularly those of Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, have not only earned theenthusiastic welcome of our friends, but have also incurred the heatedindignation of the reactionary press and of some most respectable public leaders and statesmen of the western nations, particularly in Britain. The only thing wecan say is this: They do not like our sincere pronouncements about their policyof colonialism, nor do they like our friendship with India, Burma and afghanistan, but we like this friendship very much and it suits us perfectly.This friendship of the peoples has strengthened the front of peace-loving nations,has welded it still closer. The front of peace loving-nations has become stillstronger.  It will become stronger still and we feel sure it will triumph! &quot;2. Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s speech at Moscow Airport on 21st December. Text taken from Soviet News published in London by the Soviet Embassy.&quot; The peoples of India, Burma and Afghanistan received our words with approval because they were words of truth.&quot; But with what frenzied hatred those words were received by some leadersof bourgeois countries, and especially by the reactionary organs of the press!&quot;This hatred is quite understandable. The colonial system is collapsing.It is already bankrupt in Asia. The peoples of a number of countries the Korean49286 BCONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 23rd January, 1956Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1956
Democratic People&apos;s Republic, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, the republic of India, the Union of Burma and others have cast off the colonial regimes andare consolidating the national independence of their States ....&quot;The colonial regimes are a disgrace to humanity of the present day. Wehave said this and we shall never cease to reiterate it as long as colonialists exist.&quot;3. Mr. Bulganiris speech to the Supreme Soviet on 2G:h December. Text takenby the B.B.C. Monitor from Moscow Radio&apos;s broadcast of the TASSversion in English.The Soviet Policy for Peace&quot; The closing year will go down into history as one of a definite shift in thestrained international situation which has developed over the past period. Thisshift is due, in large measures, to the efforts of the Soviet Union directed towardsensuring the peace and security of the peoples, promoting international confidence and developing extensive political, economic and cultural contacts between countries whatever their social and political systems. For Soviet foreign policy the year 1955 has been one of particularly active and persistent struggle for the consolidation of peace, for the relaxation of international tension, for widerco-operation between peoples and nations. No one can (?deny) to-day that theefforts the Soviet Union has made in this direction have been crowned with notablesuccess ....Colonial Oppression in Asia&quot; For centuries the population of many Asian countries have been subjected to severe colonial oppression, and some peoples are still subjected to it. In an effort to justify their policy and their domination over the peoples of Asia, thecolonisers have tried and are still trying to prove these peoples to be culturally andsocially backward. One should not forget, however, that the historical developmentof the peoples of Asia had begun long before the European peoples emerged onthe historical arena. And if the social and political progress of Asia was slowed down and held back for the past few centuries, this has come about throughno fault of the peoples of Asia, but through the fault of the colonisers who haveplanted in the countries of Asia, and not only in Asia but in Africa just as well, asystem of government based on violence, robbery and ruthless exploitation ofthe population. This system brings fabulous wealth to the colonisers, but forthe oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa it spells poverty and great suffering.....&quot; The peoples of great India and those of Burma have shaken off the yokeof colonial rule. These peoples, inspired as they are by the striving for theregeneration and rejuvenation of their countries, have new entered the phase of independent economic and national development. The road to freedom and independence has been taken by Indonesia and a number of other Easterncountries. The movement for strengthening national independence is growing in scope in the Arab countries. The people of Africa are active in their fight forliberation.....The British Record in India&quot; For the British colonisers, who ruled India for about two centuries, this richcountry has been an agricultural and raw materials appendage of the metropolis, a market for manufactured goods. The British were not, naturally, anxious todevelop Indian industries. This is the way of all colonisers whose objective is tosqueeze as much profit as they can out of the colonies, giving nothing, or next to nothing, in return. The people of India, having rid themselves of colonialoppression and regained their independence, have set about developing theircountry&apos;s economy under the leadership of their Government.....Acceptance of the Five Principles&quot; In that historic document of great international importance (the joint statement by Mr. Nehru and the Soviet leaders), both Governments reaffirmed theirallegiance to the principles of respect for each other, territorial integrity andsovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other&apos;s internal affairs, forwhatever reason economic, political or ideological, equality and mutual benefit,peaceful co-existence. These principles are a reliable basis for peaceful co-existence
of States with different social and political systems. The Soviet government considers that the acceptance of these principles by other countries, including theUnited States, Britain and France, would contribute to the further easing ofinternational tension and promoting the necessary confidence between thenations.....S.E.A.T.O. and the Bagdad Pact&quot; The Peoples of the Asian and African countries cannot but feel alarmed overthe establishment of such aggressive military alignments as S.E.A.T.O and the recently-designed Bagdad PaclT The S.E.A.T.O. has been engineered by the UnitedStates, Britain and France. As for the Bagdad military grouping we know well that it was Britain who played the first fiddle in whipping it up. The bagdad pact is a manifestation of colonialism in a new form. It is aggressive in essence,which is shown by the nature of the commitments of the parties to this militarygrouping. It became particularly evident after the drawing of Iran into thisgrouping.....Kashmir&quot; As for the Kashmir problem, it has been created by States which pursuedefinite military and political objects in this area. On the pretext of supportingPakistan in the Kashmir question, certain countries try to entrench themselvesin that part of India in order to threaten from there areas around Kashmir andto exert pressure on them. Attempts have been made to sever Kashmir artificiallyfrom India, to turn it into a foreign military base. The people of Kashmir haveresolutely come out against this Imperialist policy. The Kashmir question hasalready been settled by the people of Kashmir. They consider themselves an integral part of the Republic of India and strive to build in the fraternal familyof Indian peoples the new independent India, to fight for peace and the securityof the nations.....The British Record in Burma&quot; Burma has embarked on the road of independent national development asa result of the selfless struggle of the whole people against the centuries-old rule of the British colonialists, and then during the Second World War against theincursion of the Japanese militarists who ruthlessly robbed the Burmese people and looted their possessions. In the struggle for their independence the peoples of Burma have displayed resolution and heroism. The leader of the Burmesepeople in their struggle for independence, the popular hero Aung San, and hiscompanions in arms fell at the hands of the enemies of national liberation. Butthe people have achieved their goal they smashed the shackles of colonial slaveryand created an independent State, the Union of Burma. Surmounting great difficulties, due to the consequences of colonial oppression and war destruction,the people of Burma undertook to restore and consolidate their country^economy.....British Imperialism and Afghanistan: Pushtunistan&quot; The Afghan people won their national independence in a fierce struggle against the British Imperialists who tried to turn Afghanistan into their colony.The intrepid Afghan people thrice emerged victorious from this struggle and in1919 finally asseverated their independence and statehood. An important part inthe establishment of Afghanistan&apos;s independence was played by the defeat of theinterventionists in Central Asia by the Soviet State.....&quot; In our speeches in Kabul we set forth our views regarding the Pushtunistan(Pakitunistan) question, which greatly worries the Afghan people. Pushtunistanis a region inhabited by independent Afghan tribes. In 1893 the region was joinedto the British Empire, and in 1947, contrary to the interests of the tribes inhabitingit, Pushtunistan was incorporated in Pakistan.....The Western Reaction to the Soviet Leaders&apos; Speeches&quot; However, not everybody liked our visit to the countries of Asia. Ourspeeches in India, Burma and Afghanistan, and the documents of friendship signed in Delhi, Rangoon and Kabul, evoked dissatisfaction and even the indignation49286 b 2
of the reactionary press and official representatives of certain countries. They donot like our friendship with India, Burma and Afghanistan. But we like it verymuch, and we will strengthen it, just as we will strengthen friendship andco-operation with other countries. Certain Western statesmen dislike our frankstatements regarding the colonialist policy. But we, just as the Asian and Africanpeoples, dislike the colonial policy itself even more. We come out and willcontinue to come out against it because we hold that colonial regimes are a disgraceto present-day mankind and incompatible with the peaceful and democratic principles of the United Nations Organisation. During our trip statementsappeared in the Western countries alleging that our visit to India, Burma and afghanistan had the purpose of undermining relations between the peoples ofthese countries and the peoples of the Western States. Such assertions areabsolutely groundless.....The Peaceloving Nature of the Soviet Union&quot; The Soviet people, led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are engaged in peaceful constructive endeavours of building a Communist society,carrying out the sweeping plans of economic and cultural development and raisingtheir living standard. We have not threatened and do not threaten anyone, andin the Soviet Union all the peaceloving peoples will always find a staunch fighterfor peace and international co-operation.&quot;4. Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s speech to the Supreme Soviet on 29th December. Text takenby the B.B.C. Monitor from Moscow Radio&apos;s broadcast of the Tass versionin English.The Difference between Soviet and Imperialist Policies&quot; We knew that our visit to India, Burma and Afghanistan would arouse thedissatisfaction of the colonialists who fear that the consolidation of friendshipbetween the Soviet Union and the countries which but recently were under their heelwould tend further to weaken the positions of the colonial Powers. But Messieurs,the colonialists have only themselves to blame. It is generally known that theSoviet Union&apos;s principles of co-operation and friendship with other States radicallydiffer from the principles upon which the colonialists policy is built. The soviet union, setting an example of profound understanding of and respect for theinterests of all peoples and countries, big and small, proceeds from the premisethat all peoples are equal and that there are no inferior peoples. . . .&quot; In strengthening friendship with other States, the Soviet Union does notimpose its will upon thern, does not dictate any preliminary conditions, as theImperialist States do. It does not seek any special advantages for itself but proceedsfrom the principle that it is dealing with equal partners whose interests must be respected. Every people has the right to arrange its life as it wishes. Enslavementor pillage of one country by another is the greatest injustice and disgrace. . . .Western Reactions to the Soviet Leaders&apos; Speeches&quot; In certain countries, however, our trip was met in a very unfriendly andeven frankly hostile manner by some people, including officials, and gave rise tovirulent outbursts against us. This is true mainly of Britain and the United Statesof America. This line was taken up or, to be more exact echoed in othercountries, Canada, for instance, where Foreign Secretary Mr. Pearson made ashortsighted statement. What is the reason behind this? We have beencondemned, sermonised and subjected to other forms of censure because we, totheir mind, have wronged the colonisers, because we have severely condemnedthis form of oppression and plundering of the peoples of the colonial and dependentcountries by the imperialists. What then did we say about the colonialists and thecolonial regimes? Why did our statements cause such a frenzy among thecolonialists and their advocates? After all, the data we quoted is universally known and undeniable.The British Record in India&quot;It is a fact, for instance, that the British colonialists not the people, butprecisely the colonialists-ruled in India for almost two centuries, that theyoppressed for a long time the peoples of Burma and Afghanistan. What was the upshot of all this?   I will take the liberty of quoting such an eminent authority
on this question as the universally esteemed Prime Minister of India, Mr. JawharlalJMehru. He emphasises in his book &apos; The Discovery of India &apos; that &apos; the mostobvious fact is the sterility of British rule in India and the thwarting of Indian lifeby it. Alien rule is inevitably cut off from the creative energies of the people itdominates. When this alien rule has its economic and cultural centre far fromthe subject country and is further backed by racialism this divorce is complete,and leads to spiritual and cultural starvation of the subject peoples.&apos; Characterisingthe consequences of the British rule in India, Mr. Nehru recalls the terrible faminewhich occurred in the country in the years of World War II. He writes: &apos; Thisfamine unveiled .... a picture of poverty and ugliness and human decay after all these generations of British rule. That\vas the&quot;culmination and fulfilment ofBritish rule in India. It was no calamity of nature or play of the elements thatbrought this famine, nor was it caused by actual war operations and enemyblockade. Every competent observer is agreed that it was a man-made faminewhich could have been foreseen and avoided.&apos; It can be added to this that according to the Indian economist, Singh, author of the book &apos; India&apos;s FoodProblem,&apos; India was ravaged by famine eighteen times during the last quarter ofthe 19th century alone: 26 million people died from starvation during this period.During the 20th century the scale of the famines grew even bigger. In 1943 alone3,500,000 people died from starvation in India. Such are the facts. They do notspeak in favour of the colonialists.The British Record in Burma&quot; Just as tragic was the fate of the Burmese people who experienced the domination of the British colonialists. As far back as 1824 Britain began the armed conquest of Burma which ended with the complete occupation of thecountry in 1885. Burma was ruled by a Governor-General appointed from britain who held unlimited powers. During World War II Burma was occupiedby Japan. After Japan&apos;s capitulation in 1945, the British colonial authorities againreturned to Burma and tried to re-establish their domination. However, thepatriotic forces of Burma which had matured in the struggle against japanese occupation, offered resolute resistance to them. In January 1948 the Britishimperialists were forced to grant independence to Burma.Colonialism Founded on Force&quot; The peoples of India, just as the peoples of Burma and Afghanistan, did notinvite the colonialists so that they could plunder these countries. The colonialistsestablished their domination in these countries as a result of aggressive andpredatory wars. The territories of India and Burma were not uninhabited whenthe colonialists invaded them. They were populated by peoples who had their ownhighly developed cultures. It is known, for instance, that the culture of the indian people, was not inferior to the culture of the European countries, Britain included.But India was weak militarily, and she had inferior armaments. Only for thisreason she fell prey to the colonialists.The Bntish Forced Out of India&quot; To-dav, some apologists of the colonial regime say: &apos; Don&apos;t you see, wevoluntarily granted freedom to India.&apos; This is, to put it mildly, a rather conditionalexplanation why the colonialists withdrew from India and acquiesced to the^existence of an independent Republic of India. They were forced to agree to this because they had no other choice. If they had tried to remain in India, theywould have suffered great losses but all the same they would have been swept out&quot;,.by the Indian people just as the Chinese people have expelled from China thecolonialists of every shade and colour, and together with them the mercenaryChiang Kai-shek clique. The colonialists sometimes like to say that they played a great historic part in spreading civilisation. These fables are calculated forsimple minded or exceptionally gullible people, who do not know history.The Backwardness of Former British Territories&quot; May be the British colonialists really raised the cultural level of the people in the countries they conquered, may be they helped these countries to build up their own industry, to develop science and to enhance the living standards of theirpopulation? No, they were gangsters in the full sense of the word. They robbedthese countries and considerably retarded their development.  I recall how during49286 b 3
our visit to a dairy farm in Bombay, Mr. Desai, Chief Minister of the BombayState, bitterly said: &apos; Everything was reduced to nil during the years of Britishdomination, we were all but turned into barbarians in these two hundred years.&apos;&quot; The peoples of India, Burma and the other countries formerly dominated by the colonialists will have to exert great efforts to do away with the horribleconsequences of colonialist rule. After all it is a fact that but recently more than80 per cent, of the Indian population and 63 per cent, of the Burmese populationwere illiterate. It is also a fact that the living standards of the Indian population,whose exploitation brought fabulous wealth to the British capitalists, is considerably below that of Britain&apos;s population. The same is true of Burma and the othercountries which were lorded over by the colonialists for a long time. Wait a mount, the advocates of the colonial system may say to us, after all these countries were incorporated in the British Empire and enjoyed almost equal rights with britain.   But where is this equality then?&quot; We have found no traces of it. We saw that during the domination of theBritish colonialists they built magnificent palaces for themselves both in Indiaand in Burma. They provided conditions for a group of turncoat feudals, and supported them. But the multi-millioned Indian people was placed in an inferiorposition and ruthlessly exploited. It is natural therefore that the Indian people could not reconcile themselves to such a situation. The Indian people and al! thelighters against the colonialist rule in India led by such outstanding people asGandhi, Nehru and other leaders played an important part in the achievement ofpolitical independence. Of course, we sympathised with their struggle and, rejoicedat their successes and have given them their due for the courage displayed in thisstruggle.Soviet Friendship fo&apos;- the British People&quot; Now we are told that by coming out against the colonialists, by exposingtheir predatory policy, we have displayed some sore of unfriendliness with regardto Britain and other countries, although we did not name these other countries,and even Britain was rather rarely mentioned by us. However, we do not want toplay hide and seek. We know, as all the world does, who were the colonialists inIndia, Burma and Afghanistan, it is true that speaking about the unseemly role of thecolonialists, we had in view the British colonialists. But the colonialists are not all of Britain or her people. The British colonialists will never get the right ofequating themselves with the people of Britain. Our statements contained nothingthat could in some way offend Britain or the British people. We profoundlyrespect the talented and industrious British people and want to be friends withthem. We said nothing insulting or offending about the British Government either.But we condemned and condemn the colonial system and think that the sooner itwill be ended the better because it is a profoundly unjust and misanthropic system.The sooner the colonial nations get rid of it, the better. We are the most sincerefriends of those who are fighting colonial slavery and colonial dependence(applause). We will rejoice at and acclaim the abolition of colonial regimes. Ithink that the majority of the British people will also acclaim this . . . .The Struggle Against Colonialism in Africa&quot; The colonialists still have many colonies. Take for instance Africa. It is all divided between European and non-European countries. There are differentways, and different methods of conducting the colonialist policy, but this does not make the fetters of colonial slavery any lighter. These fetters strangle the peoples of the colonial and dependent countries and arouse their hatred against thecolonialists. The peoples of these countries are rising up ever more resolutely instruggle against the colonial regimes. We sympathise with this struggle and wishsuccess to the peoples who are waging it. It is simply surprising&quot; how certainshort-sighted politicians accuse us of unfriendliness towards Britain or the UnitedStates and say that we allegedly want to put these countries at loggerheads with india, Burma and other countries. They themselves commit unfriendly acts withregard to these countries ....Kashmir&quot; During the stay of Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin and myself in Kashmir,we clearly and definitely stated what the Soviet people think about this question,
that this question was not raised by the people, but was artificially fanned by certain States which are trying to incite enmity among the peoples. We learnedin Kashmir that the people regard their territory an inalienable part of theRepublic of India. The Kashmir people have settled this question irrevocably andwe are deeply convinced that they will be able to adjust their own affairs to theend without foreign interference, regardless of whether or not this is to the likingof those who would like to create a seat of unrest and international friction inKashmir.....The New Form of Colonialism: Pacts ana Economic Aid: Persia&quot; To-day the colonialists have decided to change the forms of their colonialdomination. They use less and less such crude forms of violence as the sending of troops to colonial countries and other acts of rude intervention in the affairs of the enslaved countries. They do all this more cleverly now: they bribe people who are in power, implant &apos; good Governments,&apos; and are building up aggressiveblocs, such as the Bagdad Pact. They allot money for so-called &apos; economic aid,&apos;give arms &apos; free of charge &apos; to some countries. But as pay for these arms theStates getting them must provide the colonialists&apos; gun fodder, and set up big armies,thereby exhausting their peoples.....&quot; This aid which the capitalist countries intend to render to States who recentlywon their independence cannot but be regarded as indirect help by the Soviet union to these countries. If there had been no Soviet Union would the monopolist circlesand the Imperialist States render help to the under-developed countries? Of coursenot. This has never happened before. But as I have already said, the so-called&apos; free &apos; aid in the capitalist understanding of the term can actually bring aboutthe enslavement of those to whom it will be rendered, if the countries in questionaccept it indiscriminately. Mr. Macmillan, ex-Foreign Secretary of Britain,reviewing recently the Conservative Governments achievements, declared among other things that this Government had attained a satisfactory settlement with Persia, with the result that Abadan oil started flowing to Britain in a wide stream.But this is the wealth belonging to Persia that is flowing. This is gold flowing fromIran into the safes of British, American, Dutch and French banks. And this ata time when the people of Persia are in dire straits. Giving &apos; aid &apos; to Persia, theyare taking Persian oil for a song and coining profit out of it, out of the hungerand poverty of the Persian people. We are not telling the Asian peoples: do not take the aid which American and British monopolists are offering you. But wehonestly warn them that they have to be careful about such &apos; aid &apos; because themonopolists do not give anything for nothing. The capitalists give nothing free of charge.   Capital cannot exist without profits.....Desire for Co-existence with the Western Powers&quot; We have always sincerely striven and are striving for friendship with allcountries, including the capitalist countries. We should like to live in friendshipalso with the most powerful capitalist countries the United States, Britain andFrance. Should we achieve this, and it depends mainly not on us but on theGovernments and the peoples of the United States, Britain and France, that would create conditions for genuine peaceful co-existence and competition of the twosystems. Unfortunately, we have not achieved it as yet, but we do not give uphope and we shall be unsparing in our efforts in this direction.....The Geneva Spirit and the Geneva Record&quot; Some foreign leaders and also some most unscrupulous bourgeois journalists,discussing the results of our trip to India, Burma and Afghanistan and analysingthe statements we made in those countries, are accusing the USSR of giving upthe &apos; Spirit of Geneva.&apos; This is not true. We have taken a most active part inthe important contribution to the relaxation of world tension which resulted fromthe meeting of the Heads of Governments of the Four Powers in Geneva.....&quot; We have to admit, unfortunately, that the representatives of the western powers at the Summit Conference did not go beyond unctuous words in favourof a relaxation of international tension. This is particularly true of their foreign ministers who proved unwilling to work in real earnest and to apply themselvesto achieving the aims set for them by the Heads of Government. This shows thatthe Governments of the Western Powers, having delegated their plenipotentiaries
to the Heads of Government Conference, did not want the questions on theconference agenda to be settled practically. By going to that conference theywere making a concession to public opinion which brought pressure to bear on them.....&quot; That is why, immediately upon the conclusion of the Heads of GovernmentConference, those who manufacture the means of annihilation, and those who do their bidding and hold leading positions in capitalist States, made no attempt at all to develop and spread the Geneva spirit, but instead sought to nip it inthe bud.....European Security and Germany&quot; The safeguarding of European security is the most burning issue of the day.On the settlement of this issue the solution of other international problems depends.You know, however, that our partners to the talks the United States, Britainand France oppose the German problem to this issue.....&quot; The advocates of this position do not conceal that there is but one purposebehind this military combination and that is to strengthen the camp of NATOcountries and to build up such superiority on their side as to force the USSR andthe people&apos;s democracies to knuckle under to them and to accept their terms.Fine &apos; Security.&apos; Every soberminded person will understand that plans like this are not destined to come to fruition.....Warning to Britain and France:  Possibility of Collaboration with them on european Security&quot; If we assume for a moment that the utterly unfeasible dream of bellicoseUnited States leaders to incorporate a united Germany in an aggressive bloc wererealised, the French and British would hardly have peace of mind. The Germanrevenge-seekers would have their hands free. They would act in their usual way and, of course, France would be a tempting morsel for them. We speak about this not because we want it to be so. No, we will do everything to prevent it from happening. But the experience of history teaches us that such a dangerexists, all the more so since France is weaker than the Soviet Union and the people&apos;sdemocracies, and so is Britain. Therefore we sincerely wish that we should becorrectly understood both in France and in Britain.....&quot; In this connection I would like to recall that the proposals made in Genevaby the Prime Minister of France, M. Faure, and the Prime Minister of Britain,Mr. Eden, provide a basis for negotiations aimed at safeguarding security inEurope. Agreement on this question would facilitate the solution of other major problems, including disarmament.....Soviet Strength: Moral and Technical: Sir Winston Churchill&apos;s Views&quot; I cannot but mention in passing that of late some Western statesmen displaya strange understanding of the Geneva spirit, to say the least. They want theSoviet Union to disarm its army unilaterally, they also want us to disarm morally,spiritually and ideologically. Talk on this subject is nothing new, and it is notthe first year that it has been going on, although life has on many occasions taughtbitter lessons to those who sought to dictate such terms to the Soviet Union.....&quot; The Soviet Union trains many more specialists than Britain, France, Italy,and the other capitalist countries of Western Europe taken together. No wonderthat such an active opponent of communism as Mr. Churchill who not only prayedfor the restoration of the capitalist regime in Russia, but wanted to re-establish itin Russia by force of arms, now has to admit in the training of specialists theSoviet Union has left the capitalist countries far behind. This upsets Mr. Churchill,but gladdens our hearts. . . .Quotation from Lord Chorley: Western Responsibility for Failure at Geneva&quot; The most farsighted and soberminded politicians of Britain, the UnitedStates and France understand that the position taken of late by certain circles inthe Western countries contradicts the &apos; Geneva Spirit.&apos; For example, I will refer tothe recent statement by Lord Chorley who agreed that the Western Powers beara great responsibility for the unsuccessful outcome of the Geneva Foreign Ministers&apos;Conference. Chorley said that in his opinion the theory that the Western Powersheld a monopoly of reason, held no water ....  I must note, in passing, that
we do not argue this. He said that actually they pursued a policy which, in hisopinion, was almost an obsolete &apos; Policy of Strength &apos;. On the other hand, he thinks that the Soviet Union has made several important concessions and has pursued amuch more flexible policy, resulting in considerable achievements. One cannot but agree with this assessment.Violation of the Geneva Spirit: the Baghdad Pact; Persia; Jordan&quot; Attempting to lay the blame at somebody else&apos;s door and to accuse us ofviolating &apos; The Geneva Spirit,&apos; certain bourgeois journalists refer to my statements and the statements of our other Government and political leaders. They complainthat in our statements we say that the teaching of Marxism-Leninism will triumph.But is that a violation of the &apos; Geneva Spirit&apos;?&quot; Thus, the facts show beyond all doubt that it is not the Soviet Union but itsGeneva Conference partners who are violating the &apos; Spirit of Geneva &apos;. Let ustake some more examples. It was even before the ink had dried on our joint statement on the results of the Geneva Conference that our partners in it begandrawing more countries into the aggressive Baghdad Pact they dragged Iraninto it and are forcing other countries to follow suit. . . .&quot; A few words should be said in connection with the Baghdad Pact about thesituation in the countries in the Near and Middle East. The sponsors of the bagadad Pact are known to be moving heaven and earth to inveigle the Arabnations into this aggressive bloc. But they are coming up against the mountingresistance of the people of those nations. Soviet public opinion is followingsympathetically the valiant struggle of the people of Jordan against the attempts to force their country to join the Baghdad Pact. , . .Israel&quot; It is the well-known Imperialist Powers who are backing those that are carrying out this policy. They are seeking to use Israel as their tool against theArab peoples, calculating to exploit ruthlessly the natural wealth of that area. Ata time when the Western Powers are carrying on the arms drive policy and arehammering together aggressive blocs, the Soviet Union is pursuing consistently andfirmly its peaceloving policy and strengthening friendship with all peoples whodesire it for the sake of promoting peace and security. ...&quot;
