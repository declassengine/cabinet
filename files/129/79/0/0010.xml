CONFERENCE OF HER MAJESTVS MIDDLE EAST REPRESENTATIVESSir H. Trevelyan (Cairo)The regime is in control of the country. No alternative is in sight but it hasno political base; it has therefore been decided to institute a form of parliamentary government. That would probably take the form of a list of eight candidatesnominated by Nasser for each constituency from which the electorate would beallowed to choose four Members of Parliament. The Revolutionary Council areunited, though there is an inner and an outer circle. The inner circle includesNasser, Zakaria Mohi-el-Din and General Hakim Amer. These are moderates,and are for the present firmly in control. There is also an extreme wing represented by Gamal Salem. All are Nationalist, not Communist, and single-minded in the pursuit of their social and economic policy, of which the High Aswan Dam is thekeystone.2. Nasser is not by nature a neutralist, but he is suspicious of the West,and aspires to the leadership of the Arab world and perhaps of Africa. Hefrequently says that he does not act against the West, but reacts to Western moves.He is sensitive to local public opinion and to the foreign press. He says hisdifferences with us are of tactics and not of strategy and that he wants to work with us.  His underlying concept is an Arab Pact under Arab leadership.3. On the other hand he considered the Bagdad Pact as a challenge to Egypt,and although not in theory opposed to the idea of the Northern tier, he workedagainst it. He had begun to tolerate it, but our recent action in Jordan revived hissuspicions. Egypt and the Saudis decided to try to break the British connection withJordan. Nasser fears that the United Kingdom is working for the isolation ofEgypt. But in the long run he might be willing to accept co-existence between the bagdad Pact and a wider Arab organisation.4. On Palestine, Nasser still wants a settlement, though he fears the complications arising from the recent events in Jordan. He will not go forwardunless secret negotiations reveal an acceptable basis for a settlement including asubstantial concession of territory in the Negev with land communication toJordan. Without a Palestine settlement, the chances of a settlement of the Jordanwaters seem to have diminished.5. Nasser&apos;s arms policy is dictated not by a desire for political links withRussia, but by a determination to build up the Egyptian Army so that it can crushthe Israelis either in a defensive or offensive war.6. On the High Dam, Nasser has said that it is politically impossible for himto sign a letter of intent giving the International Bank virtual control of theEgyptian economy.  But he does not want to have to go to Russia for help.7. On Buraimi, his attitude has been helpful, although he says he cannotprevent the Saudis from going to the United Nations.8. On the Sudan, Nasser admits bribery and also admits that Egyptian policy has failed. He is suspicious of our plans and believes we are promoting anagreement between the Sudan and Ethiopia.9. Egypt is still the centre of the Arab world. She is powerful enough to cause us trouble and to disrupt any attempts by us to organise the Arab worldwithout her. Nasser would be willing to use the Russians to help him in this. Butprovided we do not aim at the progressive isolation of Egypt, and can convincehim of this, we should be able to do business with him on the basis of a solutionof the Palestine problem and of giving him long-term supplies of arms. If thisis achieved, and the High Dam agreement goes through, it should be possible to: achieve a rapprochement between Egypt and Iraq, and a working agreement withthe former.Sir M. Wright (Bagdad)If it is.the case that increased supplies of oil from the Middle East are vital to us in the next twenty years, we must make the necessary effort to secure itsproduction and transport. In this case our economic interests are identical with our political and strategic interests, and we cannot afford economically to neglect them.We must, therefore, be prepared to take action, and spend money, in order toprevent things going wrong.49386 B 2
2k2.   Seen from Bagdad there are three essential problems:(a) Development and improving the standard of living;(b) Palestine;(c) the struggle for the soul of the Arab world.3. In the Bagdad Pact we have an association of Iraq and Iran which are both important oil producers, Pakistan, a member of the Commonwealth, and turkey, the strongest military power in the area. The creation of the Pact was a natural Iraqi reaction to events on their northern frontiers, and not just a whimof Nuri. Its concept and organisation enables us to guide development in two oilproducing States, and provides the only alternative to neutralism there.4. The success of the Pact depends on whether membership gives advantages to its members as compared with other Middle East States.5.   Sir M. Wright put forward the following propositions:  (a) The Economic Committee of the Bagdad Pact should be used as the choseninstrument for the development of the area. Over the years Iraq could provide the finance, but they rely on the West for marginal financial andtechnical help;(b) the United Kingdom and United States should channel their defence andeconomic help largely through the Pact;(c) United States membership or at least public support is vital;(d) to show the advantages of membership, the Secretary of State might attend the Council meeting in Iran in March, and we should give help whererequired, e.g., with Iraqi broadcasting.6.   The obstacles to the growth of the Pact are:  (a) The Palestine question, on which Nuri and other leaders are anxious for asettlement and would accept Egyptian leadership;(b) Saudi Arabian bribery, which Nuri regards as of equal importance to thePalestine question;(c) Egypfs hostility, which the Iraqis are willing to do their best to end.Mr. Parkes (Jedda)Mr. Parkes said he had not yet been received by the King, and his information was therefore limited.   He made three points:  (a) The King could not accept our action in Buraimi and Nizwa.  He must make some gesture to restore his prestige. He might cut diplomatic relations, he might go to the Security Council, or he might use force.The United States&apos; position seems to be that our action, by weakeningKing Saud, will play into Communist hands. Other friendly diplomatic representatives in Jedda take the line that we should not be inflexible,and that we should make some gesture to save King Saud&apos;s face;(b) There is a fundamental difference in outlook between the United Kingdomand the United States on Saudi Arabia. American oil interests thereare the biggest single American overseas investment. They also havean important strategic and trading interest and their pride is involvedin this sphere of influence. They view the King as America&apos;s onlyfriend, and as a staunch anti-Communist. Our view, on the other hand,is that the regime is thoroughly evil and the best guarantee of communism. It may be a fact that there is no alternative to the Kingbut he is a puppet of a corrupt regime which will only last so long asmoney is available for subsidising the tribes and merchants. Only the americans could persuade the King to adopt a more enlightened policy;(c) On Saudi bribery abroad, the trouble is that Saudi income from ARAMCOamounts to  100 millions a year. The oil companies are not makinglarge advances. But the King has secured advances against futurerevenues from Saudi merchants and American banks. Our most usefulrole would be to stiffen the attitude of ARAMCO not to yield further on the 50/50 formula, and to persuade the Saudis, through the americans, to commit their money to development instead of acting asthe paymaster of Egypt. Nehru might be able to bring some influence to bear in this direction.
Sir B. Burrows (Bahrain)The eleven States in the Persian Gulf can be divided into three groups:  (a) Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, all of which possess oil.   Much had been said about the problem of Kuwait money and development. In factit is a model compared with Saudi Arabia, its finances are sound, andits reserves so large as to cause us some misgivings. The dangers inthe situation lie in the weakness of the Ruler in handling his family,and in the future results of education largely conducted by Egyptians.In Bahrain progress has been steadier, but there is now a politicalmovement, with Egyptian links, which is pressing for representative government. We may be faced with the choice of backing the Rulerin refusing further constitutional concessions, or of advising him toagree to democratic reforms which can only weaken our own position.In Qatar oil money is limited. The problem there is the traditionallyclose relationship between the Ruler and King Saud. But all these states know the value to them of the British connection. Our policy should be to remain unobtrusive, to avoid any conflict arising between their association with us and their Arab links, and to increase Iraqiinfluence.(b) The seven Trucial States of which Abu Dhabi is now by far the largest.Our action at Buraimi has created an excellent impression, but wemust follow it up by seeing that these States are properly developed.We should foster some form of confederation between them.(c) The State of Muscat, which is larger than the others, with a populationof perhaps half a million. For the first time for fifty years the Sultan,an enlightened and educated man, has re-established his authority in central Oman. He is willing to associate himself with the West butwe must help him to hold his country. We stopped him using forcethree years ago and with great difficulty persuaded him to agree to arbitration. We have now used force with success. It would be fatal to our influence and his position if we offered arbitration over Buraimionce more.Sir John Gardener (Damascus)Syria reflects currents of opinion in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Bagdadand Cairo are rivals for influence.  Cairo is now in the ascendant.2. The country is run by the Army whose chief preoccupation is with Israel.This fact together with Saudi money and French lack of enthusiasm for the bagdad pact has made any prospect of improving relations with Iraq or with the Westremote. The Army have not yet accepted Soviet offers of arms. In the long runwe might bring round some sections of it by supplies of aircraft.3. On Palestine the Syrians would follow the Egyptian lead though they aredesperately afraid of unlimited Jewish immigration into Israel.4. The Syrians are very awkward people for anyone to deal with. Withineighteen months there might be trouble between them and the Egyptians over thejoint command.Mr. Duke (Amman)The situation in Jordan is more than usually unstable. The constitutionalvalidity of the decree dissolving Parliament has been called in question, and it isnow unlikely that new elections will be held. No Government in presentcircumstances is likely to make any move towards the Bagdad Pact.2. The British position has been damaged by recent events but it is possibleto retrieve it. The King and the Foreign Minister in the latest Government havesuggested that we should offer to negotiate a new treaty without any advancecommitment on the points to be discussed, since this might cut the ground fromunder the opposition.3. In any case we must take action ourselves to improve our influence andcheck the effects of successful Egyptian propaganda. It would be very difficult forthe Tordanians to refuse an offer by Egypt and Saudi Arabia to replace the British
JMr- Nicholls (Tel Aviv)The extraordinary psychological instability of the Israelis makes it impossibleto give a clear-cut picture. Their internal conflicts lead to sudden and unpredictablechanges in policy, so that individuals who, are normally associated with activistpolicies such as Ben Gurion sometimes appear moderate, and those who are normally moderate such as Sharrett suddenly adopt extremist policies.2. Generally, however, there is a desire for peace in Israel. But the problems which have to be faced in order to obtain peace have only recently been thoughtabout, probably only since the Guildhall speech. To this extent the situation inIsrael is improving. On the other hand, the Israelis, who had previously some hopes of the sincerity of Nasser, have lost confidence in him since the Czech arms deal.They no longer trust the Egyptians, or the United Kingdom, and accuse us of!being willing to buy Arab favour at the Israelis&apos; expenses. Their dominant emotionis fear of attack, and fear of being put under intolerable Western pressure to make concessions which would fatally weaken them. They realise their own economic,military and political weakness, but do not draw the logical conclusion that theyshould make peace now. On the contrary they hope for a miracle, and meantimeare prepared for a preventive war, though this is not the present intention of theGovernment.3. The Israelis will not commit themselves not to use the weapon of reprisals.Their recent attack on the Syrians was the least justified of any such attacks. the initial approval of the general public has, however, been followed by doubts, andSharrett has said that there will be no more one-man decisions (i.e., by Ben Gurion)on major military adventures.4.   Mr. Nicholls&apos; general conclusions were:  (a) If peace is vital, we must subordinate all other considerations to obtaining it.(b) We should strengthen the moderates by building up their faith in Nasser,and by abstaining from recrimination and quarrels on minor matters.(c) The Israelis will not be willing to allow an Arab corridor across the Negev,although they might give up some territory for the sake of a general settlement.Sir E. Chapman Andrews (Beirut)The Lebanon, though a member of the Arab League, is different from the others in many ways. The facts of geography and history have made her a half-wayhouse between the Arab world and the West. The population of the country isonly just over a million but there must be nearly 2 million Lebanese living and trading in foreign countries all over the world, and they are for the most part welloff, even rich. They are a nation of gifted money-makers and therefore believe inpeace. Their balance of trade is heavily adverse, and they have since the days ofthe Phoenicians been obliged to make their living by their wits in the formof services rendered to international banking and trade.2. Of the Christian half, the Marronites, who are in the majority, come more readily under the influence of France and have a fellow feeling with the Israelis,representing a religious and racial minority in a Moslem mass. The Lebanon wouldprobably second a peace settlement with Israel but would never dare propose one.subsidy, but the King arid his associates are strongly opposed to, such an; off elfparticularly since they believe that the Russians are behind it. The Egyptians arenot liked but the efficiency of their propaganda machine is feared.- &apos; 4. In order to improve our position we&apos;must, take active steps to improve ourown propaganda, but the condition precedent for success is a solution of thePalestine problem. The Jordanians are hoping that the Prime Minister^ Guildhallspeech will be followed up.5. Iraq should adopt a more forward policy in Jordan and send an ambassador to Amman. The Jordanians resent Iraqi indifference, but manyfavour closer union with Iraq as a counter to Egyptian, Saudi and Communist^intervention. Finally, it is necessary to co-ordinate our policy with the UnitedStates, and for it to be evident that we have United States support.
&quot;^n regard to the Bagdad Pact, the President, backed by many of the Moslems anda number of Orthodox Christians, favoured it from the first, but it is not feasible atpresent for Lebanon to accede. The idea of the Fertile Crescent is present in the minds of many if not most Lebanese, for they have a sense of community with the peoples of the north through Aleppo to the Tigris and Euphrates. They have alsothe sense that with the decline of 19th century colonialism and maritime powerand the advance of internationalism and air power, the lines of communication inthe future will tend to follow those of the old trade route along the Fertile Crescent,along the modern pipelines from northern Iraq to their terminals at LebaneseMediterranean ports; that wealth and power will flow along these lines. moreover the ancient historical connection with Egypt has been weakened by the creation of israel. Nevertheless Egypt is the only State with which Lebanon has a favourable balance of trade, the best market for her produce arid she is entirely dependent uponSyria for bread, wheat and meat.3. President Chamoun, though not a strong personality, is certainly a friend of Britain&apos;s and is so regarded throughout the Lebanon. His Presidential course is now more than half run and he is inclined to complain, quite unjustifiably that britain has not given him the help he expected. He wants arms to give his country a greater sense of security against Israeli attack and to enhance his own prestige inthe Lebanon. He also wants economic aid.
