SECRET&apos;,(56) 30COPY NO,8til February, 1956CABINETSTATEMENT ON DEFENCE 1956Note by the Minister of defence i attach a printed proof of the Statement on Defence 1956.It has been seen at -*n earlier stage by the Prime Minister, the foreign secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary, theCommonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary, the Service Ministers,and the Minister of Supply and I have had. the benefit of their commentsin preparing the present text.2. I wish to draw attention to two points(i)    the reference in paragraph 6 of the Introduction tothe possible use of nuclear weapons in limitedwar, which I think should remain.     I shall haveto deal in the debate with the question of graduated deterrence, which is arousingconsiderable public interest, and a lead-inin the White Paper would be useful;(ii)    the passages dealing with evacuation in paragraphl6(i&apos;v) and paragraphs 11^ and 11S.     These latterparagraphs have been revised after discussion bythe Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence, and thefollowing text is now proposed?&quot;The Government have carried out a review of evacuation policy.     They havereached the conclusion, which they are surewill find general support, that first attentionmust be given to the evacuation of the &quot;priorityclasses&quot;, the definition of which they proposeto extend to include mothers, young children and adolescents generally and the aged andinfirm.     They propose to discuss withrepresentatives of the local authorities proposalsfor the evacuation of these classes, includingprovisional conclusions which they havereached on re-classifying the country intoevacuation, neutral and reception areas./&quot;They also contemplate that after themovement of the priority classes further measuresof evacuation would be carried out, as time andtransport allowed.     These further measures
can necessarily only be planned inthe broadest outline, since so much^ would depend on the situation at the time J. 583. I should welcome the view of my colleagues particularly on whether the bracketed sentences at the end of the revised passage onevacuation should be included.4. The White Paper is to appear on 16th February, and becauseof the printing dispute, the final version must go to press by the evening of 10th February.W.MaMinistry of Defence,, S0W, 1.7th February, 1956.

Statement on Defence, 1956Defence policy. Paragraph 1 of the 1955 Statement on Defence set out the broad lines on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose to develop their future defence policy. The main task of the past year, a task that will continue, has been totranslate that policy into a defence programme. In that process account hasto be taken of three main factors: political, strategic and economic.Political Factors2. During the summer of 1955 there was some reason to hope for a genuine relaxation in international tensions and for the growth of toleranceand understanding between the nations of the free world and those underCommunist government. But this hope has not been fulfilled. The foreign ministers&apos; Meeting in October, 1955, made it clear that, for the present atleast, there is no change in Soviet long-term policy which, fundamentally,aims at world domination. The Soviet Government continue to believe intheir right, indeed in their mission, to impose when they can political andeconomic systems on other nations and to withhold from them the right to choose their own future. In several of their recent pronouncements theSoviet leaders have reaffirmed their belief in the eventual triumph of communism throughout the world. Their policies are openly directed toachieving this end. They claim that they wish the &quot; capitalist&quot; and communist Powers to exist and compete together, but at the same time theyseek by all means in their power to undermine the collective defences of thefree democracies. The interventions of the Soviet Government havethreatened the stability of the Middle East and they have thought fit, in pursuit of their aims, to sow mistrust between peoples, and to lend their support to revolutionary forces throughout the world.3. The aim of the democracies is to establish peace and prosperity, withinwhich the peoples of the world can develop their lives in freedom. Themilitary forces of the democracies must be designed to support this aim. Theymust adopt such a posture that the Soviet Government will see that it wouldbe mistaken and dangerous to found their foreign policy on the belief thatthe democracies need to crave co-existence. As long as co-existence is used as a facade behind which new offensives against the democracies can be planned at leisure and launched at will, it is essential that the democraciesshould maintain their strength and deploy it in such a way that those offensivesare not worth launching or are checked at an early stage. This is not to saythat we should modify in any way our attitude of readiness to negotiate onoutstanding issues whenever sincere negotiation appears possible. Butnegotiation cannot succeed unless it is clear that the democracies have the will and the means to maintain their integrity indefinitely. If it is arguable that much of the present hostility of the Soviet leaders and their assumption of aggressive intentions in the West are based on genuine ignorance, it remainsnecessary none the less for the Western Powers to hold their own in the worldby their defensive strength until such time as a true understanding of Westernpolicies can make its impact on the Soviet Government.
Strategic Factors4. The increased power of the deterrent, that is, the nuclear weaponand the means of delivering it, has made global war more frightening and less likely. Our first and chief objective must be to prevent war by themaintenance of the Allied deterrent, to which we have begun to make ourown substantial contribution. ,,It is our belief that given the deterrent, given arobust belief on the part of the free world in the strength of their institutions,and given the continued growth of N.A.T.O.&apos;s defensive power, global warcan be prevented. In the deterrent must be included an effective early warning system and the ability of the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty organisation to hold the line by land, sea and air until the nuclear counter-offensive hasbroken the back of the enemy assault.5. It is sometimes argued that, with the build-up of a stock of thermo-nuclear bombs by the Russians, the deterrent value to the Western Powersof building up a stock of bombs and the means of delivery will diminish.This is not so. The objective of the Western Powers is defensive. They will never be the aggressors, but they must have, and be known to have, thepower of instant and overwhelming retaliation if attacked. It is the retaliatorypower which is the vital factor.6. Apart from preventing global war we have to be prepared for thecontinuance of the cold war; that is the constant and world-wide threat of communist penetration short of direct military aggression. Equally we haveto be prepared for the outbreak of localised conflicts on a scale short ofglobal war. In such limited wars the possible use of nuclear weapons cannotbe excluded.7. If global war were to break out it would, as described in last year&apos;sStatement on Defence, be a struggle for survival of the grimmest kind. Itscourse would be unpredictable after the initial, intense phase. For thisreason we must, in the military field, put the emphasis on forces which areflexible, mobile, well-trained, well-equipped, and versatile. They must beready for immediate action; we can no longer rely on meeting our needs for men or munitions by mobilising reserves of untrained manpower or ofindustrial capacity. In the field of home defence, the emphasis must be onplanning and on measures to secure full co-ordination between the militaryand civil authorities. We have to develop new techniques over a wide field,and to create an organisation for home defence which can be readily expanded or adapted as changes in the international situation or in the developmentof new weapons may require.8. The forces required to support our present strategy have, therefore,four roles to fulfil-:  (i) They must make a contribution to the Allied deterrent sufficient in quality and size to maintain our standing as a world Power. Thismeans not only building up and maintaining a nuclear stockpile andthe means of delivery, but also contributing to the maintenance ofN.A.T.O.&apos;s defensive effort by land, sea and air.(ii) They must play their part in the cold war.   By their mere presencethey can contribute to the stability of the free world, and the security
of overseas territories whose peaceful development may be threatened by subversion whether overtly Communist or masquerading asnationalism.(iii) They must be capable of dealing with outbreaks of limited war should they occur.(iv) They must also be capable of playing their part effectively in globalwar should it break out. This will have to include support to thecivil authorities.Economic Factors9. The continued economic strength of the free world is an essential element in our ability to resist Soviet aggression and the burden of defencecannot be allowed to rise to a level which would endanger our economicfuture. This burden does not consist only in the effect of high defence expenditure on the general level of taxation, important though that is.Defence production falls in the main upon the metal and metal-using industries, which supply about half our exports and are of great importancein the re-equipment of British industry. They thus play a vital role in strengthening our balance of payments. The maintenance of British forces overseas involves a heavy direct charge on the balance of payments. Theclaims of defence research must be balanced against the competing claims onour limited resources of scientific manpower. And the size of the forcesthemselves inevitably reduces the manpower available for the tasks of civilindustry.10. The cost of new weapons is increasing, and will go on increasing.This means that any long-term defence programme based on the maintenanceof forces at their present level would show a steadily and steeply rising curveof expenditure. Since, failing some radical change for the worse in theinternational situation, there is a point beyond which expenditure on defencecannot be allowed to rise, one consequence of equipping our forces with thenew weapons which are essential to their efficiency in the new strategicconditions, is a decline in their numbers. As the Prime Minister announced in October, 1955 the Government have decided to reduce the manpower in theforces to about 700,000 by March, 1958. This reduction v/ill provide a relief to the national economy and will release resources for the improvement of our industrial position.11. This concept, of smaller and better equipped forces, does, however,place a premium on the highly-skilled long-service regular. Quite apart fromthe advantage in terms of morale and stability of a predominantly long-serviceforce, the newer weapons will demand for their proper use increasingly high standards of training and maintenance. The Government have decided tointroduce substantial improvements in Service pay and inducements. Thedetails will be announced shortly. They will reflect the importance whichmust in present circumstances attach to long service. It is to be hoped thatthese increases will produce a marked improvement in the level of regularrecruiting, and in particular in the numbers of men signing on for orconverting to long-service engagements.
Reserve Forces12. The new concept also involves a shift of emphasis in reserveplanning. We have two main requirements; a requirement for a number of highly-trained reservists capable, at very short notice, of reinforcing certain special areas, special units or ships, and a requirement for a larger number of reservists to act initially in the defence of this country in global war and tocome to the help of the civil population.13. There may also be the problem of reinforcement for limited war, inwhich it would be obviously desirable, and indeed necessary to resort to measures short of general mobilisation by Proclamation. It may be necessaryin due course to propose legislation to meet this difficulty.The Defence Review14. Against this background Her Majesty&apos;s Government have been engaged upon a review of the further development of the Services. this review has been carried forward for as long a period as possible. At a time of rapid technical advances there must come a point beyond which it is impracticable to plan, because any conclusions will be based on guesswork.Nevertheless, proposals for this year have had regard to probable develop-ments over the next seven years.   The objects of this review were:  (i) to ensure that the developing pattern of the Services over the next fewyears conforms to the needs of the new strategic situation;(ii) to provide for the Services reasonably long-term plans on Which their production, training and building programmes can be based. Theexperience of the last few years has shown that these programmes should be framed over a period of at least three years and viewedagainst a still longer-term plan if we are to make the best and most economical use of the resources available;(iii) to ensure that the reduction in manpower falls on those forces which involve least military risk;(iv) to ensure that the cost of defence whether in terms of manpower,materials or money does not overload the economy.In so far as the results of the Defence review may require major changes inthe size and shape of our present forces these can only be carried out over aperiod of years.15. The new policy, and in particular the concentration on improvedweapons, makes a strong research and development effort essential. Moreover,in the particular circumstances of this country. we must, if we are to keepabreast of developments elsewhere, concentrate our effort on a limited numberof projects of the highest strategic importance. We cannot afford to spreadour programme too widely. There have been signs recently of overloadingin the Research and Development programme, and from precisely this cause.The whole programme is therefore being thoroughly examined in order toestablish a better balance between the resources available and the projects towhich the highest priority should now be attached.16. The programmes of the Services and home defence are described inmore detail-in later paragraphs, but the general implications for each Service
of the strategic situation and the strategic requirements described above canbe summarised as follows:  (i) navy the Navy will maintain an effective fleet capable of supporting thiscountry&apos;s influence and interests as a world-wide Power and a memberof the Commonwealth and of N.A.T.O. The further development ofnew weapons and technique should enable it to strike whatever maythreaten us by sea in the future whether in limited or global war.(ii) army the Army will be primarily organised so that it can bring force tobear quickly in cold or limited war. Balanced forces must be retainedoverseas to meet cold war requirements and to hold the line untilreinforced if limited war should break out. A strategic reserve must beretained and must be capable of rapid transportation to the scene of trouble for cold or limited war tasks. Our forces in Germany must, as an integral part of N.A.T.O.rs defensive system, be reorganised so that theywill be capable of giving the best account of themselves should globalwar be forced upon us. Units in the United Kingdom must be availablefor all aspects of home defence.(iii) Royal Air force the Royal Air Force will provide our contribution to the nuclear deterrent in the shape of strategic weapons and a medium bomber forcecapable of delivering them. New and improved aircraft and equipment will be introduced as they become available into the air defences of thiscountry. Planning in this field is complicated by the need to take accountof the introduction of guided weapons, and to balance the importance of continued improvement in the manned fighter defence against the need to make resources available for the development and deployment of aguided weapon system. Our tactical air forces in Germany will continue their contribution to N.A.T.O. defence. For the rest the primaryconsideration in planning the air forces for both combat and transport will be their contribution to cold and limited war.(iv) Home defence at this stage the chief task in the field of home defence will be tocontinue preparations for minimising losses and casualties by developingan evacuation plan; for the progressive instruction and education of thepublic; for establishing an effective fall-out warning and monitoringsystem; and for reducing disorganisation after thermo-nuclear attack,including arrangements for enabling the armed forces to give the most effective help to the civil authorities in hard-hit areas. The servicesorganised by local authorities will be fostered.Disarmament17. The Government will continue to work for world-wide disarmamentas a means of reducing international tension and of transferring to more constructive purposes the resources which now have to be devoted toarmaments. Their ultimate goal remains the conclusion of a comprehensivedisarmament agreement, covering both conventional and nuclear armaments.
It is evident, however, that such an agreement could not be put into effect until adequate methods of control had been discovered and agreed for supervising every aspect of it; and in 1955 it has become widely recognisedthat at present no known method exists of guaranteeing the elimination of stock-piles of nuclear weapons or of controlling completely the futureproduction of potentially dangerous fissile material.18. The Government believe that the search for a solution to all theproblems of controlling nuclear disarmament must go on. They have alsobeen giving thought to the possibility of concluding an agreement whichwould permit a first instalment of disarmament to be carried out withoutdelay. They therefore joined in sponsoring at the recent United nations general Assembly a resolution proposing that the United NationsDisarmament Sub-Committee, whilst not abandoning its search for a comprehensive disarmament plan, should give priority in 1956 to early agreement on &quot; all such measures of adequately safeguarded disarmament as are now feasible.&quot; The resolution gave equal priority to consideration ofsuch measures as President Eisenhower&apos;s plan for reducing the danger of surprise attack through the exchange of military blue-prints and mutualaerial inspection. Increased confidence is generally recognised to be anessential pre-condition of any large-scale disarmament. It follows that theadoption of even a modest degree of disarmament related to conventionalweapons, coupled with appropriate measures for control including aerialinspection, should create an atmosphere in which bolder advances couldfollow.19. In modern conditions war can occur so swiftly and so devastatinglythat it is impossible to expect states to undertake to disarm unless they are assured that other states will honour any commitments they may have assumed. Agreement on an international control system which can adequatelysupervise every step of disarmament therefore remains the crux of thedisarmament problem. Despite this, however, and despite the advancestowards the Western position which were contained in the new Soviet proposalsof May 10 last, the Soviet Government have still refused to accept theproposals of the Western Powers on the control problem, or to producerealistic proposals of their own. So long as this attitude is maintained, thereis little hope of making effective progress towards disarmament.Conclusions20. The advent of the hydrogen bomb has enormously strengthened thepower of the deterrent and provided the deterrent is maintained the likelihood of global war has decreased. The main threat to our freedom and securitywill come from an intensification of the cold war in all areas susceptible toCommunist penetration and our forces must be prepared against the possibleoutbreak of limited wars. There is no sign that the leaders of Soviet Russiahave abandoned their militant Communism and their aim of world domination.Nor are they prepared so far to accept the implications of a realistic schemeof disarmament. Accordingly in present circumstances the level of our defence effort must be maintained. The forces will become smaller but harder-hitting forces, and will be deployed and organised to meet an altered threat;but we must at all times retain the ability, in association with our allies, to
meet the continued threat of Communist aggression with defensive forcesproperly trained and equipped for the job.II. THE . PROGRAMMES OF THE SERVICES .The Royal Navy21. For the reasons given earlier in this paper, the long-term plans forthe Navy must be based on the deployment of a smaller fleet than at present.It is therefore more than ever important that this fleet should consist of ships of modern design and that their equipment should keep pace with developments.22. The cold war is the most immediate threat. The Navy is able to play an important part in upholding our interests and influence in peacetime indistant parts of the world. By its presence on many foreign stations, by itsclose ties with the navies of other nations, and by the goodwill that itengenders in foreign countries, the Navy is a valuable weapon in the cold war against Communism.23. In limited war we plan to make immediately available in any part ofthe world a force of aircraft carriers equipped with modern aircraft andsupplemented by cruisers and escorts. Emergencies that do not require action by aircraft carriers can be dealt with by cruisers which, because they are capable of sustained operations away from base, are the most economicalunits of sea power.24. The fleet will with these forces continue to make a substantial contribution to the naval strength of the Commonwealth, N.A.T.O. andS.E.A.T.O. in meeting the needs of global war.25. The new construction and modernisation programme is designed toensure that the fleet, though small in numbers, is well armed and up to date.A programme for adapting existing aircraft carriers will provide for the fleetsufficient vessels to enable modern types of aircraft to be operated. good progress is being made with the guided missile programme and it is intended that these weapons should be installed in both the new cruisers and the newdestroyers. Since the threat from submarines is much greater than anythingthis country has had to face before, the Navy is continuing to pay greatattention to increasing the effectiveness of its anti-submarine forces by thebuilding of anti-submarine ships and aircraft and the development of anti-submarine helicopters. The submarine is capable of substantial development and the Navy is planning to replace its submarine force with vessels ofconsiderably higher performance. Research continues into new methods ofpropulsion, including the use of nuclear power.26. The Admiralty have concluded a survey of the reserve fleet with aview to ensuring that the best ships are kept available for service, at short notice at the smallest possible cost to the country. They plan to keep in thereserve fleet only those ships capable of putting to sea at short notice and fighting effectively in a modern sea war. Of the other ships in reserve, those that are obsolete or have reached the end of their useful life will be disposed of.27. The structure of the shore support of the Navy is being examined toensure that it meets the charged requirements of the active and reserve fleetswhich are being reshaped on the lines described above.
10 the Army28. A large part of the overall reduction in manpower between.now and1958 will of necessity fall on the Army as the largest Service. This reductionwill involve a considerable measure of reorganisation, including reductions inestablishments, in training staffs, in Headquarters and in administrative and supporting units.29. This is, however, only one side of the picture. In conformity withthe new concept of flexibility the Army must not only be capable of giving agood account of itself in a war in which nuclear weapons may be used, but must also be able to adapt itself to limited war conditions. Extensive trialsto determine the best organisation for a nuclear war have taken place inGermany. While the details are still being worked out it is already clear thatthe infantry division, although of the right general structure, can be given moreweight over a wider front by integrating armour with the infantry brigade andby adding medium artillery. Changes will also be needed in the present formof the armoured division to make it more mobile and flexible, and thus enable it to exploit rapidly-changing conditions, by reducing the number of supporting units to a minimum required for armoured action.30. The new organisation of these basic fighting formations can, and will,be adapted to the needs of theatres other than Europe.31. The same principle of securing the greatest possible flexibility isbeing applied to the re-equipment programme. The range of arms held byunits will be simplified and reduced, and their effectiveness progressivelyincreased.32. We shall be receiving in 1956 initial supplies of the American surface-to-surface guided weapon known as Corporal. Training in handling and deployment will start this year and the introduction of this weapon into service will greatly strengthen the defensive power of our forces.33. The Army and R.A.F. are jointly carrying out experiments todetermine whether helicopters or other forms of aircraft capable of taking off and landing in confined spaces, could assist in solving the Army&apos;s problems of greater flexibility and mobility arising from the new circumstances.34. With the redeployment of our forces from the Canal Zone it has beenpossible to make progress with the build-up of the Strategic Reserve in thiscountry. Its strength at any one time will, of course, depend on variations inour overseas commitments. We have recently, for example, reinforced theMiddle East, and it is precisely this kind of requirement which the strategic reserve is designed to meet. A large part of it is trained and organised for transport by air.35. For the reasons given in the Introduction to this Statement and as already explained by the Secretary of State for War in December 1955, the role of the Reserve Army is fundamentally changed. A major reorganisationis now under way. Only two Territorial Army divisions and a number of supporting units will be trained and fully equipped for overseas service.Most of the rest of the Reserve Army will be organised as infantry divisionswith the initial task of home defence in all its aspects; they will be trained tofight as well as for civil defence duties since there can be no certain forecast
0 11of events, arid they will be backed by their own support including engineers,transport, repair, supply and medical services. The Reserve Army will,however, no longer need its present scale of armour and artillery, and someof these units will either amalgamate, disband, or convert to other roles.36. The T.A. Airborne Division will be reorganised as a Brigade Groupdesigned to make the maximum use of parachute volunteers both to keep the technique alive and to provide a nucleus for any additional special air serviceunits which may be needed.37. In the light of modern weapon developments it is clear that there isno longer any justification for maintaining Coast Artillery. The seabornethreat can be countered more effectively by the Navy and the Air Force, andother types of artillery can, if needed, be used for seaward defence. TheGovernment has therefore decided that all existing Coast Artillery units will either be converted to new roles by amalgamation with other units orbecome inactive. So far as possible, however, it will be the aim to preserve the identity of all Territorial Army Coast Artillery Regiments in someother role.38.- It will be some time before plans can be fully worked out and there organisation of the Reserve Army on these lines completed. As already announced, the Home Guard has been reorganised on a reserve basis, with small active&apos; cadres remaining as a framework for expansion in emergency.The Royal Air Force39. The primary task of the Air Force continues to be the build up of theV Bomber Force and its associated stock of nuclear weapons which togetherwill provide our main contribution to the Allied deterrent. The mannedbomber provides an effective and flexible means of delivery of our strategicweapons, and technical improvements will be progressively introduced whichwill maintain the ability of the bomber force to strike home if the needshould arise.40. The Valiant, the first of the V Bombers, is now in service and we expect that it will be followed into service by the Vulcan during thecoming year.41. For some time to come the manned fighter must continue to providethe backbone of our Air Defence system. The fire power and lethality of fighter aircraft will be markedly increased by equipping them with air-to-airguided missiles. The first generation of missiles will become available from production in the course of 1956-57. They will be brought into service with a special mark of the Swift, and will be used to gain experience of this type of weapon.42. Although manned fighter aircraft and their weapons will improve,the surface-to-air guided weapon will in time play a predominant part in air defence. A production order has been placed for these weapons for trials withthe Air Defence system. Because of the area of destruction of nuclear weaponsclose defence of vulnerable areas is an outmoded concept. It must be the aim to design a guided weapons system which can break up enemy attacksbefore they penetrate over the coastline and which can be integrated withour fighter defences.
m43.   Plans have already been announced for the provision of training facilities in the Hebrides for all types of guided weapons.44. An efficient Control and Reporting System is essential for timelyretaliation by our strategic counter offensive and to the operation of our air defences. Considerable advances have been made during the past year bythe introduction of new equipment and by linking our radar defence with similar networks on the Continent. Following the meeting of the N.A.T.O.Council in December, 1955, the planning of a co-ordinated air defence system for N.A.T.O. is being pressed ahead. We shall co-operate fully in thedevelopment of this system which will also contribute to the air defences ofthis country.45. The 2nd Tactical Air Force in Germany and Coastal Commandcontinue to contribute to N.A.T.O. air power. Hunters are replacing Sabresin the 2nd Tactical Air Force. The equipment of this force will be furtherimproved during the coming year by the introduction of the fighterreconnaissance version of the Swift and the Night Interdictor version of theCanberra.46. Cold and limited war tasks emphasise the importance of air mobility,upon which all three Services, particularly the Army and the Air Force, must depend in the event of emergencies overseas. Aircraft both of Transport andother Commands of the R.A.F. are playing an increasingly important partin improving the strategic mobility of our forces.47. Increasing importance attaches to the ability of our air forces overseas,including the R.A.F. Regiment, to support local operations. The use of the pioneer for jungle work in Malaya has provided valuable experience whichwill be applied to the future employment of aircraft of this type.III.-FINANCE48. The economy of the United Kingdom has been overstrained duringthe past year by the demands placed upon it, and in consequence the balanceof payments has worsened and the gold and dollar reserves have beendepleted. The Governments economic policy is directed to removing the excess demand for goods and services. There is therefore a pressing need to limit defence expenditure to what truly is essential and to ensure that the best possible value is obtained for what is spent. Particular attention is being given to the prices paid by the Defence Departments and to the efficient management of Service stockholdings.49. Pending the conclusion of negotiations with the Federal Governmentof Germany, it has been assumed that support for the British forces inGermany will continue throughout 1956-57 at the same rate as in the concluding months of 1955-56.  50 million has therefore been appropriatedin aid of Service Votes ( 40 million Army,  9 5 million Air Force, and 0 5 million Navy). To the extent that such support is not provided, thelocal cost of maintaining these forces will fall on our own Defence Budget.50. The total of the Defence Budget proposed for 1956-57 beforededucting receipts from American Aid is  1,548 1 million as compared with 1,537-2 million in 1955-56. After deducting American Aid, the figures are 1,498-7 million in 1956-57 compared with  1,494-2 million for 1955-56.
Summary of Estimates51. The following table compares the Estimates for 1955-56 with those for 1956-57.  An analysis of the 1956-57 figures is provided in Annex II:  Before Deducting Receipts from American Aid  million	Estimate	Estimate	1955-56	1956-57Admiralty ...	347 0	351 0War Office        ......	484-0	479-air Ministry       ...	540-4	517-5Ministry of Supply	147-5	1850Ministry of Defence	18 3	16-2	1,537-2	1,548-7After Deducting Receipts	from American	Aid	  million		Estimate	Estimate	1955-56	1956-57Admiralty ...	340-5	346-0War Office........	474-0	472-air Ministry	513-9	479-5Ministry of Supply	147-5	1850Ministry of Defence	18-3	16-21,494-2 1,498-752. The above figures include the cost of the increases in Service pay and emoluments, of which details will be announced shortly.United States Aid53. The total of  1,548-7 million for the Defence Budget, includes provision for expenditure in 1956-57 representing  50 million of the sterlingequivalent of, or of sterling arising from, aid from the United States. Thisaid, which is of the same four types as in 1955-56, has been allotted asfollows  millionAir	Navy	Army	Force	total defence Support Aid	1-5	2-0		3-5Agricultural Commodity Aid   ...	3-5	5-0	 	8-5Special Aircraft Purchase	fill    - -	-	12-5	12-5Additional R.A.F. Programme ...			25-5	25-55-0      7-0      38-0      500
i 0HThe nature of these four types of aid has been described in previousStatements on Defence. The provision for  3 - 5 million of Defence SupportAid represents the total outstanding balance to be received by Service votes of aid of this type. None of the  8 - 5 million of Agricultural Commodity Aidprovided for in Service Votes, 1955-56, will be distributed in that year, and provision, therefore, is again made for that sum. It was explained inparagraph 58 of the Statement on Defence, 1955, that the provision in AirVotes, 1955-56, for Special Aircraft Purchase, was made up of a dollar and asterling element; the first deriving from legislation passed by the United StatesCongress in 1953 and the second from legislation passed in 1954. During1955-56, the full balance of the dollar element was received, but no sterlingpayments are now expected to be made. The provision for 1956-57, therefore,represents the sterling proceeds of all the $35 million of United States surplusagricultural commodities to be sold to the United Kingdom under the UnitedStates legislation of 1954 relating to this scheme. The provision of 25 - 5 million in respect of Aid for an additional R.A.F. programme is much larger than the corresponding provision ( 10 million) in 1955-56. deliveries of aircraft and equipment will not all be completed to enable the full 10 million to be received in 1955-56 and the balance is reprovided. Therest of the  25-5 million mainly represents expected payments on contracts,as mentioned in the Statement on Defence, 1955, for purchases of aircraft andequipment from Her Majesty&apos;s Government by the United States Governmentto be made available to the Royal Air Force. The balance represents expectedreceipts from the United States Government of sterling arising from the saleof surplus agricultural commodities and allotted, under arrangements made bythe two Governments, to defray expenditure by the Air Ministry on certainequipment. In addition, and as part of the scheme for assisting in there-equipment of the Royal Air Force, the United States Government will make available to the Royal Air Force a number of Hunter aircraft purchased from her Majesty&apos;s Government under offshore procurement contracts to a valueof approximately  13 million.IV. MANPOWER AND RESERVE FORCESActive Forces54. Regular Recruitment. The following table gives the number of maleregular recruits entered in each of the financial years 1952-53 to 1954-55 andthe number which it is estimated will be entered in the financial years 1955-56and 1956-57.Male Regular RecruitsActual Estimated1952-53    1953-54 1954-55 1955-56   1956-57Navy         ...      10,100       9,100 7,700 7,500       9,000Army        ...      50,800      41,300 38,900 34,000      42,000Air Force ...      38,600      30,700 26,100 21,000      30,000Total   .  ...      99,500      81,100      72,700      62,500      81,000
55. The following table gives the male regular strength of officers andother ranks at April 1954 and April 1955 and the estimated strengths atApril 1956 and April 1957.	Male	Regular	Strengths				Actual		Estimated		1 April	1 April	1 A pril	1 April	1 April	1953	1954	1955	1956	1957Navy	133,700	121,000	114,200	106,500	104,800Army	211,300	216,900	223,800	196,400	192,000Air Force ....	188,900	186,500	180,100	162,600	167,800Total	533,900	524,400	518,100	465,500	464,60056. In both the above tables the estimated figures for 1956-57 reflect theimprovement in recruiting and prolongations of service which it is hoped willbe effected by the increased rates of Service pay shortly to be announced.57. Two things are needed to improve the regular structure of the armed forces; to increase the number of recruits and to induce as many recruits aspossible to sign on for long engagements; and to persuade those alreadyserving to prolong their service. An initial engagement of three to five yearsonly is too short; we need more men to accept initial engagements of six,nine or twelve years and more three, four and five-year men to prolong their service. For the highly technical armed forces of the future, we require asubstantial proportion of men of long service and experience.58.. The problem is urgent. Regular recruiting which has very largelybeen of men on short-term engagements, has already fallen from its post-warpeak of 100,000 in 1952-53 to about 62,000 in 1955-56. In the Navy,extensions and recruitment have declined to such a point that the manningof even the smaller active fleet is becoming more difficult. In the Army andthe Air Force, far too high a proportion of men are on three to five-yearengagements, and too few of these men are extending their service.59. The new proposals on pay and inducements, which will be announcedseparately in a few days&apos; time and will be coupled with considerable changesin the present system of engagements, are specifically designed both to attractadditional numbers of recruits on regular engagements, and also to strengthen the long-service element of all three Services, and thus get nearer to the manpower structure of the forces which obtained between the two Great Wars.60. It is hoped that over the next few years the effect of the new pay code will be substantially to increase the long-service element in all three services. This will make them more efficient, because only thus can be built up the &quot; hard core &quot; of men of long service and experience who provide thebulk of experienced non-commissioned officers and tradesmen. It will alsobe more economical, since a rapid turnover of short-term regulars involves a heavy and wasteful training burden, increased movement between home and overseas stations, and the return of a man to civil life when he is beginning tobe of the greatest value to his Service. If this structural change in the three services which is the main object of the pay improvements can be effected,many of the manpower problems of the forces, even if not wholly solved, willbecome far less intractable; and the day will be brought nearer when increased
16 M...      &apos; %reliance upon strong and efficient regular forces will permit an easing of theburden of national service.National! Service Requirements61. As already announced in the White Paper on National Service(Crrid.. 9608) there will be three registrations for National Service in thecurrent year. The Services should require to enter in 1956-57 about 162,000national servicemen (including men who undertake regular engagements in lieu).  The requirement for each of the Services will be:  Navy    ................ 4,000Army   ...      ...      ...      ......      106,000Air Force       .............        52,000162,000Total Size of Active Forces62. The forces will be reduced from about 800,000 men and women asin the summer of 1955 to about 700,000 by 31st March, 1958. This reductionhas already begun and will continue in 1956-57. The reduction will be spreadas evenly as possible over the whole of the period. During 1956-57, the total strength of the active forces is expected to decline by about 37,000. In thefollowing table, total strength at 1st April, 1955, is compared with estimatedstrengths at April, 1956, and April, 1957. A detailed analysis is given inTable I of Annex I.Total Active StrengthsActual Estimated1 April, 1955 1 April, 1956 1 April, 1957Regulars    ...      ...      ...      518,119 465,500 464,600National Service  ...      ...      284,954 289,100 253,400Women      ...      ...      ...       20,557 17,400 17,000823,630 772,000 735,000Reserve sad Auxiliary Forces63. The strength of the reserve and auxiliary forces, including part-timenational servicemen, decreased slightly during 1955 from about 647,000 on1st January, 1955, to about on 1st January, 1956.  The numberof normal volunteers also decreased from 117,000 to .   The totalnumber of National Service reservists remained steady throughout the year at about 530,000 men. Table 2 of Annex 1 compares the strength ofthe volunteer reserve and auxiliary forces at 1st January, 1955, and1st January, 1956.64. There has been a disturbing drop in the number of national servicemenwho have offered themselves as volunteers in the reserve and auxiliary forces.The role of many of the reserve and auxiliary forces will be changed but itwill not diminish in importance. And, as in the past, the efficiency and spiritof those forces will depend on the volunteer. It is our belief that, once thecontinued importance of the reserve and auxiliary forces has been realisedand it is seen that their new role is no less critical to survival than that
107which they have played in the past, the present trend will alter and larger numbers of volunteers will come forward to make their unique contributionto the strength and preparedness of the military forces of the United Kingdom.Future of the National Service Scheme65. In the Autumn of 1955, the Government reviewed the NationalService scheme in the light of the reductions in the armed forces on which ithad decided. The results of this review were announced in October, 1955,in the White Paper on National Service (Cmd. 9608) and subsequentlyapproved by the House of Commons on November 2nd, 1955.66. Although it has been decided that the efficiency of the Servicesdemands that the period of whole-time national service remains at two yearsthroughout 1956-57 it is proposed to restrict the intake of national servicemenduring the year in the manner described in the White Paper. The burden ofpart-time national service will be lightened in 1956-57 as a result of thedecision, also announced in the White Paper, that, with a certain limited number of exceptions, national service reservists shall not be required infuture to carry out more than twenty days of their sixty days&apos; liability for part-time training.Colonial Forces67. Seven battalions of the Malay Regiment, one battalion of theFederation Regiment, a battalion from Central Africa and a battalion ofthe Fiji Regiment, as well as the Royal Malayan Navy and the R.A.F.Regiment (Malaya) are still actively engaged against the terrorists in Malaya.In East Africa there are seven battalions of The King&apos;s African Rifles. Ofthese, five are in Kenya, one is in Uganda, and the seventh provides the garrisons of Tanganyika and Mauritius. The Kenya Regiment and the east african Independent Reconnaissance Squadron continue to serve in Kenya.68. The present strength of the armed forces raised by the colonial territories is about 42,000. In addition, in certain Colonial territories localpersonnel are enlisted in the United Kingdom forces. These now numberabout 16,000. The number of United Kingdom officers and N.C.O.s providing the necessary leadership and cadres for the organised units of the colonial forces is about 4,000.V.-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT69. An increase has been made in the financial provision for research anddevelopment in 1956-57 to accommodate the new weapons of greatercomplexity and higher quality which, as has already been said, must be developed if our forces are to be adequately equipped in the future. Althoughdevelopment of some of the more conventional weapons has been cut out or reduced, these weapons will continue to be used in many circumstances, andsome research and development work must still continue on them. At thesame time, a number of new and technically very complex projects, particularly those associated with the deterrent, will be making increasingly heavy demands on our resources. The whole programme is being kept under review, withthe dual aims of maintaining the right balance between the newer and the older kinds of development projects, and of ensuring that the effort which wecan afford to devote to defence research and development is deployed to the
best advantage. Within the programme as a whole the effort on research as distinct from development must be maintained. There can be littlediminution in specific research aimed at solving our immediate problems,while the necessity for longer term research increases as techniques become more complicated. It is on the success of research that the future effectiveness of our forces will primarily depend.70. Work on the development of a variety of nuclear weapons continuesto expand. The progress made is such that two further series of tests areto be held in 1956; the first will be in the Monte Bello Islands in the springand the second will be later in the year, at Maralinga, in South Australia.The latter series of tests will be the first to take place at the site which, withthe co-operation of the Australian Government, is being developed as aweapons proving ground.71. Particular emphasis is being placed on the development of theballistic rocket as a deterrent to aggression.72. Progress continues to be made in the development of guided missilesfor each of the Services. The number of trial firings in this country and atthe Weapon Research Establishment, Woomera, is increasingly steadily andthe results show that satisfactory solutions have been found to many of the complex technical &quot;problems which arise in the development of weapons ofthis kind. Some encouraging successes have been achieved in trial firings ofboth air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons. An increasingly valuable contribution is being made by Australia at Woomera.73, Service personnel are participating in trials on an increasing scale.The experience so gained will be a great advantage at a later stage when the weapons are introduced into the Services.74. The dominant factors in the field of aircraft development are the enormous and continuously increasing technical, industrial and financialeffort demanded by each new project, and the need to ensure that our resources are not overstrained.75. The V-bombers are fundamental to our deterrent strategy. TheValiant is now in service with the R.A.F. while the Vulcan and Victor havereached an advanced stage of development. The development is also in hand of later versions of the Vulcan and Victor incorporating more powerfulengines which will give increased range and height.76. In the fighter field, the first mark of Javelin has been cleared for delivery to the R.A.F. and development work on later marks continues.Development of the English Electric P. 1 is proceeding satisfactorily.77. Increasing effort is being devoted to the solution of the problems offlight at high supersonic speeds, including the problems of take-off from and landing on existing airfields and aircraft carriers. Various methods of achieving vertical or near vertical take-off and landing are being explored.78. In the naval field, the first prototype of the new day fighter/ strikeaircraft, the N. 113, has flown successfully and is at present undergoing furthertrials. The N. 113 will be followed into service by an all-weather fighter, theD.H.T10, and by a strike aircraft of advanced design. The Navy is pressing forward with the use of helicopters in the anti-submarine role.
79. Two experimental high-speed submarines should be completed nextyear. Considerable advances have been made in increasing the range ofunderwater detection equipment and in associated weapons. The guided weapons trial ship should begin work next summer, and the plans for thefirst operational ship to use guided weapons as its main armament are goingwell.80. In the field of Army weapons and equipment great importance isattached to increasing the strategic and tactical mobility of the Army.Weapons of greater mobility, range and fire-power are needed which must atthe same time be simple to use and to maintain in the field. Continuedattention is also being paid to developing air transport, to improving methods for the rapid construction and repair of airfields and to developing vehicleswith improved cross-country performance. New materials are constantlybeing produced by industry and research and development into their use inweapons, equipment and clothing for military purposes is being intensified.81. Close co-operation with the United States of America has continued with mutual benefit, particularly on guided weapons. There is also anintimate co-operation within the Commonwealth, maintained by a number oforganisational links with individual countries, by the Commonwealth AdvisoryAeronautical Research Council and by the Commonwealth AdvisoryCommittee on Defence Science which is at present meeting in Canada. as was recently announced by the Minister of Defence to the North atlantic council, the United Kingdom has offered to assist her allies in thedevelopment of guided missiles.82. To sum up, an adequate research and development programme isessential for the fighting efficiency of our Services. The smaller the size ofour forces the more important it is that they should be equipped with the bestmodern equipment. The balance between research and development expenditure and expenditure on the armed forces in general is a very delicateone, and with the rapid advance of science and technology our investment in research and development is bound to be heavy if our forces are to remainequipped with modern weapons.VI.-PRODUCTION83. A year ago, in view of under-spending in earlier years, increasedallowance was made for the effects of development difficulties with newequipments. As a result, it is expected that in the current year the Admiraltyproduction expenditure will be nearly as estimated, and that under-spendingby the War Office will be small. Unfortunately, there will be heavy under-spending on the production programme for the Air Ministry. This arises from two main causes; shortfalls in delivery, and alterations in the production programme after the Estimates were published. Under the first head therehas been some loss of production due to strikes and the development of new types of aircraft and other equipment has continued to be beset by difficulties;the technical problems involved are often highly intractable and the time required for their solution cannot be forecast in advance.. Under the secondhead, as has already been announced in Parliament, orders for some marks
of Swift were cancelled, and the production programme for the Javelin wasrephased in order to provide a better balance between the earlier and latermarks.84. The provision made for the aircraft and equipment production programme for 1956-57 has been rigorously examined in the light of theexperience of the last two years. It also reflects the progressive reshaping ofthe Royal Air Force under the long-term review and allowance has been madefor small reductions in the total orders for certain aircraft. The main typesaffected are Valiants, Hunters, Seamews, and a few Shackletons.85. The current Naval programmes of new construction to current design,and of modernisation have improved the quality of the active and reservefleets this year, and will continue the process next year. Greatly improvedequipment for the detection of hostile aircraft and the control of fighters isemerging from development to production, and will shortly be fitted in new ships and as a part of the modernisation programme.86. The Army programme is being adapted to meet the needs of nuclearwarfare. The aim is to provide equipment that v/ill improve mobility,flexibility and fire power. Apart from Corporal and the helicopter trialsalready mentioned, trials will be held this year of a new armoured car, theSaladin, and of very high frequency wireless sets for use in units.87. On the Air programme, as a result of last year&apos;s underspending,expenditure is expected to be greater in 1956-57 than in 1955-56. The mainemphasis will continue to be placed on the production of aircraft andequipment for the V Bomber and the all-weather fighter forces. As already stated, the first air-to-air guided missile will come off production this year.88. The super-priority scheme, which was originally introduced inMarch, 1952, is being discontinued. Its use was of value during the rearmament programme but it is no longer appropriate to the conditions ofto-day when our problems are mainly ones of development. In so far ascritical difficulties may arise from time to time affecting the production ofparticularly important equipments, special action will be taken in consultationwith the industries concerned.Offshore Procurement89. The value of the new contracts placed in the United Kingdom in 1955by the United States under the Offshore Procurement Programme amountedto $33 million, bring the total value of these contracts up to $683 million.The contracts were for the supply of Centurion tanks, guns, vehicles and miscellaneous items of equipment.Military Aid imm the United States and Canada90. Further deliveries of equipment have been received under the UnitedStates Mutual Security Act, and we have continued to receive assistance fromthe United States for the expansion of our ammunition production capacity.91. We have also continued to receive supplies of ammunition,-propellants and explosives under the Canadian Mutual Aid Programme.
VII. COMMONWEALTH AND international co--OPERATION92. During the past year the normal close co-operation between theUnited Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries has beenconsolidated by discussion and formal agreement on specific aspects of defence planning.93. The United Kingdom Government have reached agreement with theGovernment of the Union of South Africa on a number of defence matters which are described in Cmd. 9520. In particular, plans for the naval defenceof the sea routes round Southern Africa have been discussed and arrangementsagreed for command and joint planning in this field. In these discussionsit was recognised by both Governments that the defence of Southern Africalies not only in Africa but also in the gateways of Africa, namely the middle east, and the various problems that arise out of the defence of this area were considered. The agreement also contemplated joint sponsorship by theUnited Kingdom and South Africa of an international conference to continuethe study, already begun at the Nairobi Conference in 1951, of the lines ofcommunication in Africa.94. In the Far East the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australiaand New Zealand have agreed to set up, and have contributed forces to, a commonwealth Strategic Reserve, containing naval, air and army elements,to be stationed in Malaya and Singapore for the defence of that area against aggression. Arrangements for the command of this Reserve and for joint planning have also been agreed and machinery established for this purpose.95. Commonwealth land forces in Korea will have been reduced by the spring of this year to an infantry battalion plus ancillary units, and Common-wealth responsibility for co-ordination in the Korean theatre will betransferred to the United Kingdom. (Only to be inserted if these arrangements can be revealed by the date of publication.)96. The forthcoming Prime Ministers&apos; Conference will provide once again the opportunity for an exchange of views on all matters of common interest.North Atlantic Treaty Organisation97. At the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in December, 1955,N.A.T.O. Defence Planning as a whole was reviewed in the light of thecontinued Soviet threat to Western security. It was recognised that the most urgent requirements for Western Defence at present are the early creationof a co-ordinated air defence system in Western Europe and an adjustment ofthe defence effort of the Alliance as a whole to achieve the most effectivepattern of forces in the new strategic situation which the advent of thehydrogen bomb has created. To this end, a series of discussions on specificdefence problems will take place between the military and civil authorities ofN.A.T.O. during the coming months. These will assist the member countries to recast their defence programmes to meet the needs of a thermo-nuclear war.The United Kingdom Government particularly welcome the important contribution made by another Commonwealth country, Canada, to all these activities.98. The Civil Emergency Planning side of the North Atlantic Councilswork has been reorganised and strengthened by the creation of a new high
level Committee to assist the Council in formulating general civil defence policy and in co-ordinating national action in this field.99. Following the Paris Agreements of October, 1954, the pasf year hasseen the entry of Germany into the North Atlantic community. The build-upof the German armed forces to the agreed levels began on the 1st January, 1956,and is expected to extend over a period of three or four years.Western European Union100. The Council of Western European Union is taking steps to ensurethat the undertakings laid down in the Paris Agreements are being observed.To this end, the Arms Control Agency has been established and has begun to exercise its control functions from the beginning of this year.101. The Standing Armaments Committee of W.E.U. has made a goodbeginning with its work. Its purpose is to improve consultation andco-operation in the armaments field and to help member nations to meet their equipment requirements efficiently and economically. To this end, theCommittee will arrange for studies to be made of the development,standardisation, production and procurement of individual items of equipment and armament.S.E.A.T.O.102. In March 1956, the Ministerial Council of the South-East AsiaTreaty Organisation will meet in Karachi to review the work of theOrganisation since the signature of the Treaty in September, 1954, in increasing the defensive preparedness of the Treaty area, and co-operation on political and economic matters. The Council will have before it reports onthe present military strength of the area and will consider strategic planning for its defence against aggression. It is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to co-operate fully in the development of an effective organisation for the defence of South-East Asia against direct attack or political subversion,and the active part which the United Kingdom has played in the work of theorganisation will be continued in the Ministerial discussions and the futureprogramme.The Bagdad Pact103. The decision of the Governments of Pakistan and Iran to join the bagdad Pact in the Autumn of 1955 made it possible to set up machinery toextend and improve the scope of present plans for the defence of the middle east against aggression. As a result, very satisfactory progress was made atthe meetings of the Military Committee and Ministerial Council in November.A permanent organisation to maintain and develop continuity in defence planning and to prepare the ground for future Council meetings is in processof being established.VIII. HOME DEFENCE104. In the Statement on Defence, 1955, an account was given of thelines on which home defence preparations would be pursued. the appreciation then given of the likely effects of a thermo-nuclear attack remainsbroadly valid, and good progress has been made with the overhaul of plansthere referred to. Decisions on some of the matters dealt with are recorded in this statement: others will be announced as the review proceeds.
105. The reshaping of home defence plans has to have special regard tothe revolutionary implications of the threat of persistent contamination fromradioactive fall-out over very wide areas. Sufficient is already known, from information made public by the United States Atomic Energy Commission inFebruary, 1955, and from other information available to the Government, toestablish the nature and extent of this threat; in contaminated areas severerestrictions for some days on movement out of doors would be called for.For purposes of survival under such conditions the household becomes the basic unit. So general and widespread a danger will need to be met primarily by each household acting on guidance and instructions from the central andlocal authorities both before the event and after. Measures to inform thepublic of the nature of the danger and of the measures they can take to counterit in their own homes will accordingly occupy a place in the forefront of theGovernment^ plans for home defence.106. To give full protection to everyone from sickness or death from thehazard of radioactivity alone would involve physical preparations on a vastscale and to make such preparations against all the hazards of a thermo-nuclearattack on this country would place a crippling burden on the national resources. Whatever the preparations made, an attack on this country wouldinvolve loss of life and destruction on an unparalleled scale. Unduly heavy expenditure now on purely defensive measures, by weakening our economic strength and reducing the resources available for building up the strength ofthe deterrent, might very well work against the primary objective of ensuring that global war itself is prevented.107. Nevertheless, within the proportion of our resources that can bemade available for home defence, the Governments aim will be to take the precautions without which, should the worst happen, ordered society couldnot survive. The emphasis will be on plans and preparations to establish asystem of warning and monitoring of radioactive fall-out and an adequatescheme of control, through the organs of central and local government, and toensure the availability of the necessary communications; to build up local and national services, trained and equipped to deal with casualties and to mitigate the other effects of thermo-nuclear attack; to revise evacuation plans; tosecure the continued functioning of essential public services; and to inform thepublic fully, both as to the dangers involved and the steps that can be takento meet them.Research and Development108. One task of the first importance is to continue and expand research into the problems of nuclear warfare, and into the most effective and practicalmethods of dealing with them. Many factors of fundamental importanceremain obscure; and the danger of misdirected effort is considerable.Research, both basic and applied, will accordingly be pressed forward to thelimit of resources available.Civil Defence Services109. The training of members of the Civil Defence Corps and theIndustrial Civil Defence Service has continued under revised syllabuses withan increased emphasis on practical methods, and local authorities have
steadily been providing more and better premises for the training of volunteers, including special training grounds for the Rescue Section of the corps.110. The measures set out in last year&apos;s Statement on Defence for preparing the armed forces to meet their increased responsibilities for homedefence are gathering momentum; it is proposed that the wartime headquarters of the civil Regions and the corresponding military districts should be in thesame locality. But the need for strong and efficient local civil defence servicesremains as great as ever. Among the new features of civil defence control will be the use of mobile headquarters and wireless communications on a wider scale than hitherto. The need for closer liaison between the armed forces and the civilian forces of civil defence is fully recognised. Partly tomeet this need, and partly because of the increasing burden as other plansdevelop, the Government made appointments in September, 1955, to newsenior posts of Regional Director of Civil Defence in each of the Regions inEngland, and a post of Director of Civil Defence for Wales. In Scotland,these requirements are met by the Secretary of State&apos;s Department in edinburgh.The Role of the Armed Forces in Home Defence111. All armed forces, whether regular or reserve, in the country at theoutbreak of war will have to be prepared to assist in the struggle for survival.The new concept of reserve forces has been described in paragraph 12. the armed forces are in no sense a substitute for the civil administration; the aimwill be to support the civil authorities by all possible means. The newly-appointed whole-time Commander-in-Chief, United Kingdom Land Forces,will have as one of his main functions the development of the military side ofthe necessary joint training and planning.112. One particularly important contribution that the armed forces can make is in air reconnaissance and emergency air transport; and it has beendecided that in the event of global war, considerable resources from flying training Command and Home Command should be made available for these purposes.The Mobile Defence Corps113. The formation has begun of the first 25 reserve battalions of the mobile Defence Corps which a year ago it was decided to raise, train andequip for fire fighting, rescue and ambulance duties. The response to theplan for the enrolment of volunteers to provide the officers and N.C.O.&apos;s ofthese units has been encouraging. The flow of national servicemen tobattalions has started, and the strength of units will build up to a maximumin 3  years&apos; time.114. One month&apos;s special training in rescue and ambulance duties isbeing given to selected national servicemen towards the end of their whole-time service and one 15-day camp during part-time service. Special training centresare being opened in various parts of the country. In the light of experiencesince the inception of the scheme, and especially in view of the success ofthe scheme for training reservists as fire fighters described below and thedifficulties of giving Army and R.A.F. officers sufficient training and practical
experience in fire fighting, it has been decided not to proceed with the raising of Mobile Defence Corps battalions for fire fighting; in consequence the planned strength of the Mobile Defence Corps will be reduced from 48battalions to 36, sustained by an annual intake of 7,500 men from the Army.This will not result in a reduction of the total number of Service reservistsbeing trained for civil defence work; the reduction in the numbers for the mobile Defence Corps will be more than offset by increasing the number of reservists made available by the Services for training in fire fighting by theHome Office from 10,000 to 15,000 a year. The Army will provide 2,500 mena year and the number of R.A.F. Class H reservists will be increasedto 12.500.Training of Reservists in Fire Fighting115. The first Home Office depot for training in fire fighting duties,staffed by officers seconded from local authority fire brigades, opened in Julyat Chorley in Lancashire; by the end of 1955 4,000 reservists had receivedtheir first period of two weeks&apos; instruction in fire fighting. As was announced in the White Paper on National Service (Cmd. 9608), the reduction in theliability of national servicemen for part-time training required special arrangements to be made to ensure that reservists allotted to fire fightingduties carried out two periods of training; as from 1st January, 1956, the first period of 15 days&apos; instruction in fire fighting is being given to these men during their period of active service. A second training depot, also staffed by fire service instructors, will be opened by the Home Office in the summer atMoreton-in-the-Marsh, Gloucestershire, at which 15 days&apos; more advancedinstruction will be given to men who have completed their preliminary trainingin fire fighting duties. As a result of the decision to increase the numberstrained under this scheme from 10,000 to 15,000 a year, referred to inparagraph , a third training depot will be required, and it is hoped toprovide this early next year.Oher Emergency Fire Preparations116. In war the bulk of the fire fighting resources of the country wouldbe organised in mobile columns which would be stationed outside the mainbuilt up areas. Special types of equipment have been developed to enablethese mobile formations to operate successfully. Selected firemen frombrigades throughout the country have attended the newly established fire service Tactical Training Centre at Reigate for the purpose of determiningby experiment how the new types of equipment can be used to best advantage in operations and of providing material for the preparation of new operational and training instructions for the Fire Service.Evacuation117. The problem of devising measures of evacuation on a. scaleappropriate to the risks of thermo-nuclear attack has been engaging theGovernments closest consideration. They recognise that new plans arerequired and that these must be bold in scope but simple in principle and execution. Many more people than in the last war will have to be enabled,if they wish, to leave much wider areas. The increased demand thus created for transport and accommodation has to be reconciled with the facilities available.   Fall-out would be specially hazardous for people caught in the
open without accommodation to go to, and this fact underlines the importanceof an orderly plan.118. The Government have reached provisional conclusions onre-classifying the country into evacuation, neutral and reception areas, and extending the definition of the &quot; priority classes&quot;; and on certain furtherevacuation measures. Before making any public announcement, theGovernment intend to discuss their proposals, on a confidential basis, withrepresentatives of the local authorities and with both sides of industry.Warning and Monitoring of Fail-out119. The Government regard the establishment of effective systems formonitoring radio-active fall-out and providing public warning as one of thefirst requirements in home defence and are making the necessary arrangements.The Air Raid Warning Organisation now have the additional responsibilityof giving public warning of fall-out, and the Royal Observer Corps have beengiven the duty of monitoring fall-out so as to provide the WarningOrganisation with the necessary data. A full-scale trial ox reportingprocedures has already been held, End further trials will take place in the spring. Arrangements are also being made for the regular observation ofthe upper winds at great heights, knowledge of which is needed to forecast the direction and intensity of fall-out.Communications122. The Post Office have made considerable progress in the constructionof a cable and ultra high-frequency ^adio network outside the main towns,designed to ensure the maintenance of vital communications in the event of a nuclear attack.Shelter123. A good deal is now known about the ways in which some measureof protection could be obtained against the effect of nuclear v/weapons. Fullprotection within a few miles of the ground burst of a megaton weapon is impracticable. Outside this range protection against blast and heat could beobtained from shelters similar to those used in the last war. The danger offall-out however necessitates shelters which can be occupied for periods of48 hours or more. An ordinary brick dwelling house with 9-inch walls usedto the best advantage reduces gamma radiation by a factor of about 20 times.A useful degree of protection could be obtarr,d by greatly thickening theexisting walls and ceilings or roofs of houses. To give a high degree ofimmunity, the ideal would be a shelter below the surface of the ground,preferably inside the house. But to provide this degree of protection on a country-wide scale would result in a; insupportable burden on our economy,and the Government have reached th^ conclusion that considerations of finance and resources preclude a programme for the construction of domestic sheltersat public expense.124. Many houses and other buildings may, however, containaccommodation which could without much difficulty be adapted for use asshelter in an emergency, and the Government propose to initiate surveys todetermine how much shelter could be provided in this way, and what the costin money and materials would be.   Pilot surveys, from which much useful
information is expected, have already been undertaken at the request of theGovernment by selected local authorities. Civil defence manuals will containadvice to householders on the best means of protecting themselves in theirown homes.Casualties and the Homeless125. The casualties resulting from a nuclear attack on this country wouldbe likely to surpass in numbers anything with which the ordinary hospital services, however expanded and diluted, could expect to deal. The planning of measures to meet such a situation demands a new approach to the problemof the hospital services in war and a new emphasis on self-help in the form oftreatment in the home. As regards the homeless the pre-attack movement of population due to evacuation will give rise to extensive problems of welfarefor those who have left their homes; after the attack the extent of movement is much less certain, and it may be that the initial immobility imposed overwide areas by fall-out will severely limit movement away from damaged areas and the operation of the relief services. Subsequently there may have to be large-scale movements of people from undamaged homes in areas wherepersistent high levels of residual radioactivity would make continued livinghazardous for a period of, possibly, some months. The problems of organisingand controlling any such movement and of caring for the people involved arebeing closely examined by the Departments concerned.Public Utilities and Industry126. Water supplies, transport, sewerage services, electricity, gas and telephone communications and essential industry will all have a vital part toplay, not only immediately after the attack and during the subsequent period when large areas of the country would be contaminated by fall-out, but also for ultimate recovery. Earlier plans addressed primarily to the restorationof these services after physical damage provide only a partial answer to theproblems of operation under fall-out conditions. Further study by the experts of the various services is being carried out by the responsibleDepartments.Emergency Ports127. Emergency facilities have been provided to replace those in theexisting major ports, which are likely targets for attack. Engineering andother works have been carried out in minor ports and elsewhere, and a reserve of mobile cranes and floating grain elevators has been built up. Work on theemergency ports scheme continues.Stockpiling128. An appreciable strategic reserve of food in the form of bulk stocksalready exists. The turnover of such stocks is necessarily expensive and inpresent circumstances it is not proposed to make large additions to them.129. Further progress has been made in the arrangements for importingand distributing oil supplies in time of war and for acquiring a strategic reserve of oil. In the coming year, work will continue on improvinginstallations such as strategic pipelines and emergency importing facilities.
130. Stocks of medical supplies and equipment will be required forthe treatment of casualties after a thermo-nuclear attack and further purchasesare being made for the necessary stockpile.131. The heavy cost of turning over stocks has led the Government todecide on some reduction during 1956 in the strategic holdings of industrialraw materials. These holdings are large and they can be run down to someextent without undue risk.Equipment132. In the coming year, production of necessary supplies for training and of certain types of operational equipment for the civil defence and fire-fighting services will be continued. Special emphasis is being placed on theprovision of radiac instruments, which are vital for detecting and measuringradioactivity, on the vehicles and signal equipment needed for control, andalso on continuing the build-up reserves of fire-fighting appliances. TheGovernment have decided to discontinue further production of civilianrespirators. Having regard to the difficulties of mounting a successful gasattack, it appears improbable that even the most deadly nerve gases wouldbe used against urban areas by an enemy who had nuclear weapons and themeans to deliver them available to him. Existing stocks of civilian respiratorsof both the new and last-war patterns are considerable and will be maintained,but further expenditure on production of civilian respirators cannot bejustified.Finance133. In the financial year 1956-57,  45 million will be provided for defence expenditure by Civil Departments (including loan expenditure bythe Post Office). An analysis is given in Annex III. This total compares with Estimates amounting to  69-66 million in 1955-56 and with estimated expenditure for the year of approximately  50 million (excluding the 4 - 8 million provided for the transfer of certain trading stocks to the strategicstockpile, as shown in Annex III of the Statement on Defence, 1955). Thedifference is primarily accounted for by lower expenditure on stockpiling,and the provision for 1956-57 is applied chiefly to measures for improving theefficiency of the Home Defence organisation. Expenditure by the service departments on the Mobile Defence Corps and personnel for fire fightingwill be increased.Home Defence Conclusion134. Much progress has been made in the field of home defence inreshaping our plans to take account of the implications of nuclear weapons in the megaton range. This must be a continuing process. It is necessary,however, to accept that there are definite limitations to what we can attemptin home defence. These are set first by the decision to place the mainemphasis on our contribution to the deterrent forces of the N.A.T.O. Powers,and secondly from the appreciation that the probability of resort to the ultimatesanction of global war has been lessened rather than increased by the emergence of thermo-nuclear weapons.
