THIS iJP&amp;UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY JS COVERNMEl4&apos;&quot;secret.P,(56) 23 COPY NO. 4 J6th February, 1956CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME;  WIDOWS&apos; benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 31st January(C,M0(56) 8th Conclusions, Minute 5), the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee&apos;.&apos;) Report on Widows&apos; Benefits, was published on 3rd February,its unanimous recommendations were the sifbject of preliminary consideration by the Home Affairs Committee on 27th January and were further discussed on 30th January by a Committee of Ministers under the lord privy Seal who has asked me to bring the matter before the Cabinet(GEN. 515/lst Meeting).2,      The issues involved are set out at length in my paper to the HomeAffairs Committee (HoP0(56) 9).     The recommendations themselves arein paragraph 87 of the Committee^ Report which was circulated with my paper.     The recommendations are inter-related and the AdvisoryCommittee emphasise their view that they should be taken as a whole.The Report endorses and cariies further the principles underlying thepresent provisions.    That is to say it seeks to make substantially better provision for widows while they have the care of children, and to ensurethat those who are not provided with a long-term benefit are fully coveredfor sickness and unemployment until they are re-established in self-supporting employment,    I understand my colleagues in the Sub-Committeof the Home Affairs Committee have found the recommendations generally acceptable, but wished me to invite the Cabinet&apos;s attention to certain specific points which I deal with below.Rate of childbs allowance3,      The Committee recommend that the amount allowed for each child of a widow should be &quot;substantially&quot; increased.     They were precluded bytheir terms of reference from suggesting a specific amount.    We have therefore to. consider what an appropriate increase would be.    TheCommittee have drawn attention to the fact that the proportion of widowed mothers who have to have recourse to National Assistance is 30 per cent,substantially above the proportion for other National Insurance beneficial&quot;!The larger the family, the higher proportion, and in the case of widowswith four or more children the Committee mention that it reaches75 per cent.    An increase of 5s. for each child would do no more thanbring the proportion of widowed mothers on assistance down to the levelsobtaining for National Insurance pensioners.     This amount would makethe payment for each of the widow&apos;s children 16s, 6d., which has theadvantage of being the current rate paid for children of a war widow who,however, not only has a higher personal benefit but gets family allowances
as well where she has two or more children.    A case can be made for ahigher figure than 16s. 6d. , e.g. the 10s. paid to the guardians of orphans,but I thir-k 5s. will be accepted by Parliament as a fair interpretation ofthe Committee^ recommendations and as right in itself.Pension age for widowed mothers4.      At present, a woman who has drawn widowed mother&apos;s allowanceup to the age of 40 or beyond can thereafter get a widow&apos;s pension for life,but a childless widow, or a woman who is wodowed after her children have passed out of the family allowance field,, cannot get a widow&apos;s pensionunless she is over 50 when her husband dies.     The Committee say matif their general recommendations are accepted, this special treatmentnow accorded to women who have drawn widowed mother!s allowance should disappear and an entitlement to widow s pension should in suchcases only arise if the widow is 50 years of age when entitlement towidowed mother&apos;s allowance ends.    It is recommended that this change should not affect any woman already widowed at the time when the change is made.    Paragraph 6 below shows that, while this recommendation willhave no immediate effect, it will over the years yield very substantial savings to the National Insurance Fund,     The Advisory Committee havemade a very good case for this recommendation based on the betterpi-provision to be made for &quot;the widowed mother, both while she has children in her care and in re-ectablishing herself in employment when they aregrown up0     They also stress the &quot;gross inequities&quot; arising from thepresent provision.    It does involve the withdrawal of a right under thescheme, but this will not affect any existing widow, nor in fact is anywoman now in a position to know that this change will affect her.The linking of marriage s5.      The question has arisen whether; when we accept the reduction ofthe duration of marriage requirement from ten years to threes it isnecessary to retain the present concession whereby, when a woman whoseright to widowrs pension depends on duration of marriage is widowed buther last marriage had not lasted long enough to qualify her for pension,,she can bring into the account the duration of an ea.rlier marriage incertain cases.    For the concession, she must either have been receiving a widowss pension from her earlier marriage or there must have been less than three years between the marriages, apart from, any period inwhich widowed motherrs allowance was paid.     The idea underlying theprovision is that, where there is only a short interval between the periodsin which the widow was either married or had a widow&quot;s benefit,  she willhardly have got re-established in employment.    When the general duratiorof marriage requirement is reduced co three years, the occasions for theuse of the linking rule will be few and the point becomes a very small one;and I think it would be unfortunate to depart in this respect from theCommittee&apos;s recommendations which we should accept as a whole.Cost6.      The financial statement attached to H. P. (56) 9 shows mat thecost to the National Insurance Fund of the Committeers recommendations as a whole on the basis of a 5s. increase for each child would be 3jj millions in the first&apos;year - with, however, a saving of  1 million tothe Exchequer on National Assistance.    These figures would show noimportant alteration for ten years or so but theieafter the cost wouldt
el J.diminish and, disregarding National Insurance expenditure already allowed for in the Family Allowances Bill, there would ultimately be a saving tothe National Insurance Fund of  1 million.7.      I understand that the figure of 5s. for the increase of the child&apos;allowance is acceptable to the Chancellor of the Exchequers though he isreserving his position generally in view of the position in respect of the10s. widows, to which I will now refer.The 10 s. widow8.      As I warned the Cabinet on 31st January, the most difficult problemboth politically and on merits is that of the 10s. widow.     There are atpresent 180, 000 of these ladies;   some 3, 000 or 9, 000 new 10s. pensions are at present issued annually;   and, though the total number of them isgradually declining, it is estimated that there will still be over 100, 000of them in 1974.     The way in which this class of pension was continued by the Act of 1946 is set out in paragraph 11 of H. P. (56) 9 and the pledge   .&apos;given at the time is set out and commented on in paragraph 56 of theNational Insurance Advisory Committee!s Report.9.      My predecessor was under severe pressure, mainly though notexclusively from our own Party, to improve this pension.     On the face ofit if 10s. were right in 1946, it is arguable that it can hardly be right in1956, and it is of course a fact that the vast majority of pensions both national Insurance and others have been increased since just after the war,M.y predecessor^ action in referring this matter to the Advisory Committeewas criticised on the grounds that it was intended to result in delay-     Thefact that the Advisory Committee have taken the view that it is outside their terms of reference to make a recommendation about the rate ofpension which should be paid to these widows will undoubtedly resuli in agood deal of discontent.    The Advisory Committee take the view that thisis a matter which should be &quot;decided by considerations other than thosewhich govern the provision of. benefits under the present scheme, andtherefore by considerations which are outside the ordinary purview of thisCommittee, and on which we are not prepared to express an opinion&quot;.(Paragraph 68).10.     The main recommendations of the Report will, if put into operation,confer substantial benefits on a number of these widows.    In theCommittee&apos;s view, which I share, these recommendations will cover mostof the cases in which hardship can be said to exist.     This is particularly the case of the recommendation under which these ladies would be givenimmediate rights to unemployment and sickness benefit.    Another sectionof them will receive benefits under the new scheme as the result of thereduction of the necessary length of marriage from 10 to 3 years.     Butthe fact must be faced that these recommendations will not help a certainnumber of them, particularly those who do not go out to work and to whommis pension is a useful supplement either to other income or to thesupport given by relatives.    Equally, this pension is appreciated by anumber of widows who are in full work and who are able to draw it,because no earnings rule is attached, in circumstances in which theycould not draw other benefits to which they might be entitled.
(a) to make no change;(b) to continue the pension at its present rate to existing pensioners but to stop new issues of it at a convenient date related to the changes recommended in the Report;\(c) to increase the rate of this pension.    In thelight of other changes the most obvious rate at which to fix it would be 15s0 ;(d) to increase the rate, ray to I5s. , and cut offnew pensions as proposed in (b) above.12.     The matter is largely one of political judgment.    My personal view is that we are not likely to be able to hold the 10s, rate very much longer5particularly in view of the complications referred to in paragraph^ above,,On balance therefore my preference would be for course (d) above,    I donot think it would be porsible to cut off further issues of the pensionwithout making an increr.se, and I feel strongly that it would be -quite impossible to cut off further issues of the pension even following anincrease in the rate, if that increase in the rate were seen to be theresult of a surrender to pressure rather than of a Governmentalinitiative.13.    The difficulty in making a choice is accentuated by the fact thatthese widows do command a considerable volume of sympathy and, whilethe main recommendations of the Report would undoubtedly deal with thegreater number of real cases of hardship, it is not possible to say thatthey will deal with all of them.    I doubt, therefore, as indicated above,whether it would be possible to stand on the 10s. rate, particularly afterthe provisions of the Pensions (increase) Bill are known.14. The cost to the Fund of raising the rate from 10s. to 15s. would amount in the first year to &amp;.Z\ millions.    Against this there would be a set-off of  -^ million relief to National Assistance 0     But if, in accordancewith course (d) above, this increase were coupled with a cessation of newawards the extra cost would decline and would be very small in ten years-time.     In twenty-five years8 time the combined operation would result ina saving of about  1 million a year to the Fund.15.     I have been into the question of repercussions.    I must accept that action along the lines of course (d) would result in it being necessaryto make an increase to 30s, in the rate of the 20s. pensions of WarPensions and Industrial Injuries widows.     The combined cost of thiswould be  150, 000 a year, but I think it is likely that these are changes which would have to be made before long in any event.16. I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is concerned at the possibility of repercussions involving an adjustment of the non-contributory old-age pension, the 26s. maximum of which has been frozensince 1946.     This is the old means test pension for men and women over70, and no further issues of it will be made after 1961.    It has since 1947been administered,  subject to a means test, by the National Assistance
Board and is tending to be treated more and more as simply a branch ofNational Assistance.    Its means standards are different from national assistance, being in some cases more and in others less advantageousthan those laid down for assistance.    But, as National Assistance rateshave been increased, it is rapidly being merged in assistance.    I am not aware of any serious pressure to increase the 26s., apart from theperennial and insistent pressure to increase National Assistancegenerally.    I do not believe that changes in this pension would have to be conceded as a consequence of any change in the 10s. widowTs rate.17. I should add that, whereas the other matters dealt with inthis paper would require legislation, alterations in the rate of the 10s.widows&apos; pensions, and a cut-off of its issue, can be effected by statutory instrument-  subject to the negative prayer procedure.18. As requested by the Cabinet on 31st January, 1956, I attachas an appendix a draft of a statement to Parliament. So far as the 10s.widow is concerned, alternative passages based on paragraphs H(a) andft(d) above are submitted.J,A0B, -C.Ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W.C.2.4th February, 1956.appendix i will vvith permission make a statement about widows1 benefits.2.      Her Majestyfs Government have now consi&apos;. ered the Report of theNational Insurance Advisory Committee which was laid before this house on 3rd February.     The Committee in their Report stressed that their recommendations should be considered as a whole.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to accept in full&apos;the recommendations of theCommittee.     These are set out in detail in paragraph 87 of the Report,,3.      The Committee, in paragraph 37 of the Report, recommended thata substantial increase should be made in the benefits paid in respect of thechildren of widowed mothers.   &apos; They felt, however, that they wereprecluded from recommending a particular figure by their terms ofreference.     The Government have come to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to increase this benefit by 5s,, thus raising the payment foreach child from 11s. 6d. to 16s. 6d., including family allowance.4.      Similar improvements in respect of the provision for childrenwill be made in the Industrial Injuries Scheme.5. These changes will require legislation which will be laid beforeParliament in due course.    It will not be possible to proceed with this
legislation this session and it would, in any event be desirable beforelegislating to see the other Reports to which the Committee refer.6. .    The Committee considered the position of the 10s, widow,, thatis to say, the widow pensioner whose title derives from her husband&apos;sinsurance under the scheme which was superseded in 1948.     Theacceptance of the Committee&apos;s Report will result in a number&apos; of thesewidows obtaining full widcw!s pension under the current scheme and all of them will receive further National Insurance rights.     There will,however, be a number of these widows who will not obtain any benefit from the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and none of them will do sountil H is possible to enact the necessary legislation.    In view, therefore,of the changed value of money, the Government havs decided to increasethe rate at which these pensions are payable to 15s.     The Governmenthave also reached the conclusion mat, when the improvements proposedby the Committee are in effect, it will no longer be appropriate, in viewalso of the lapse of time, to isiue new pensions of this category and steps will be taken subsequent to the implementation of the AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s Report to terminate the issue cf new pensions of this sort.7.      The increase in the rate can be effected by Statutory InstrumentThe necessary Statutory Instrument will be laid before Parliament in aweek or two&apos;s time.Alternative to last two paragraphsThere remains the question of the 10s. v/idow as those widowswhose title derives from their husband&apos;s insurance under the schemewhich was superseded in 194S are commonly called.    As the House willbe aware the Advisory Committee did not feel able to make any recommendation in respect of the rate of these pensions though it gavefull and careful consideration to the position of these widows.     TheGovernments acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations will result in a substantial number of these widows receiving a full widow&apos;pension under the current scheme and in all the others receiving furtherrights under the National Insurance scheme.     The Committee have said that these recommendations will cover the obvious cases of realhardship among these widows.    In the circumstances the Government donot feel that there is any justification for increasing the rate of thesepensions which have no counterpart in present provisions for widowhood,and which are, in a considerable number of cases, paid where no pension at all would be paid to widows under the present scheme.
