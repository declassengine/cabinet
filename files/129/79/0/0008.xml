secret.P. (56) 8 COPY NO. Jf^j9th January, 1956CABINETIMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYMemorandum by the Minister of works the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ paper (C.P.(56) 4) seeksagreement for the immediate demolition of Collcutfs Imperial Institute.I fully appreciate how urgent is the need for a decision, but at the sametime I feel bound to put before the Cabinet as briefly as possible someconsiderations in favour of its preservation and its inclusion in theImperial College scheme as recommended by the Royal Fine art commission,2.        This building cannot just be dismissed as Victorian work andall that that might imply.    It is regarded by architects as showing anextraordinarily acute and ingenious architectural intelligence.    It isby any standards a very fine building, a major piece of Londonarchitecture and part of the London scene.    It was built to last and, asan inscription on its face records, to commemorate the DiamondJubilee of Queen Victoria.3.        Recently, Mr. Goodhart-Rendel, the distinguished architectand critic, in a lecture to the Royal Institute of British Architectssaid that it seemed to him &quot;so far as my knowledge goes to be one ofthe most beautiful buildings of its kind and time not only in Englandbut in Europe&quot;,  and again &quot;I do not regard the tower only but the wholeof the Imperial Institute as one of London&apos;s most beautiful possessions.I therefore find it hard to believe my eyes when I read in the papersthat there has been a proposal to pull it down&quot;.4.        It is of course true that if this building was demolished andnew buildings erected on its site the College would obtain moreaccommodation:  although I believe the extent to which the Collegewould gain has been exaggerated.The College architect cannot be blamed for wishing to implement his original scheme:  but equally I believe that, faced withthe necessity of recasting his scheme and making full use of theCollcutt Building, he would work out proposals which might well givethe College more room than the ChancelIor&apos;s paper suggests.For instance, I asked my Chief Architect to consider thepossibility, which so far as he was aware had not been previouslyconsidered, of introducing mezzanine floors without any alterationof the exterior, making four floors where there are now two.     Thisis thought to be feasible in such a massive building and would provideroughly another 14,000 square feet;  not much, but there are other
possibilities such as the Royal Fine Art Commission has put forward,i0 e. to use part of the building as the Science Library, and so on;   -5, The arguments for the destruction of this building may be strong:  but I feel I ought to pose the question whether it is wise to run the risk, if it can possibly be avoided, of inducing at the outset of this great scheme of expansion the sort of public outcry which willbreak out when destruction begins:  destruction not by some privatespeculator but by decision of the Government itself.It is well known how public opinion can react when a land-mark is destroyed to which hitherto little attention may have beengiven simply because it has always been taken for granted,6.        I am bound to hope that my colleagues will agree to theretention of the Collcutt building in the Imperial College scheme, andto ask the College to work out their plans accordingly.P. B-H.Ministry of Works, S 0 E. 1.9th January, 1956^
