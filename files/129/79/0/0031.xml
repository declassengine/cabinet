^B[)CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET^| C.F.(56) 31 COPY NO. ^\Sth February, 1956CABINETEVACUATION POLICYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment and Minister for Welsh AffairsIn the last war, a scheme was prepared to evacuate priority classesI from certain limited areas declared to be evacuation areas.    Some four millionI persons were covered by the proposals; and in the upshot about l  millionsI were evacuated.2. In 1950 a revised scheme was published extending the priority classesI to some 30 per cent of the population of the evacuation areas as then defined.I It is clear that this scheme would not be adequate for a war in which hydrogenI bombs were used, and on a number of occasions during the last two years theI Government have said that they have been giving close consideration to theI problem, since a decision on the extent of evacuation from our cities is basicI to all home defence planning.3. In an island of this size, there is no completely satisfactory solution ^^^HI of the problems caused by the enormous   damage, from blast, heat and wide-I spread fall-out, and any scheme is open to serious objections.    The MinisterialI Committee on Civil Defence have examined a number of proposals and areI agreed that any scheme should satisfy the following conditions:-(a) it must be simple;(b) it must be flexible, since the circumstances ofthe emergency cannot be accurately foreseen;(c) it must be practicable, and must be so regardedby the community;(d) it must not be so alarmist as to dishearten our ^^^|Allies now, or to cause panic evacuation when ^^^|war seems to be approaching;(e) it must enable the economic life of the nation to ^^^|be carried on as long as possible; ^^^|4. We think that any scheme must involve dividing the country intoI   I evacuation areas, neutral areas (which should surround all evacuation areas),land reception areas.    A map is attached giving some indication of how the^LwM     ? country might be divided up.    (it is generally agreed that Swansea-Neath should: I be an evacuation area and not a neutral area as shown on the map.) ^^^hmmM I
5,       A case can be made out for basing evacuation policy on a detailed JAAJHAA plan announced now for near-total evacuation of all our major cities and their ^^^Asuburbs.    We reject this approach on both practical and psychological grounds ^^^AAAA It would involve a movement of half the population during the preparatory AAAJstage.    It could never be carried through to completion and would be seen AAAAA I   to be impracticable; for this reason it would fail in its primary purpose ofmaintaining confidence and morale.    More than this, it would have a HAAJpositively demoralising effect on our own people and produce the worst ^^^Aimpression on our Allies both now and in the event of war, for planning to be HAAJHAA           related to the total disruption of production.    Our objections to such aHHJ scheme apply no less strongly to any variant of it, e.g. to distinguish between HHHBAVJ one evacuation area and another by restricting total evacuation to the largest HHHHHJ centres of population only. HHHHHJ 6.       It is our unanimous view that the only defensible basis of approach HHHHHJ is to limit detailed plans and planning to the much narrower objective of the HHHHHJ evacuation of priority classes only - broadly speaking applying the time- HHAHHJ honoured doctrine of &quot;women and children first&quot;.    For this purpose we HHAHHJ I        should take a definition of the priority classes which would be wider than in the HHAHHJ last war including, for example, all adolescents up to age 18 and, since the HAVJHHl areas from which they would be drawn would be more extensive than in HHA?AVj previous schemes, the total number involved might reach 11.8 millions - HHAHHJ 47 per cent of the population of the areas concerned.    For all these people - HHAHHb or such of them as on the day took advantage of the official scheme - detailed HHAHHJ arrangements for transport, reception and billeting would be made.    The HHAHHJ movement itself would take some ten days to complete from the time theHHJ &apos; Government decided to put the scheme into operation. HHAHHJ 7.       Some members of the Ministerial Committee think that to make no HHAAj   ! prevision beyond this would not satisfy the requirements of planning for aHHJ thermo -nuclear war.    In particular it would provoke a demand for the HHJHHJ provision of shelter for the adult population remaining in the evacuation areas. ^HHHHJ   I       Their view is accordingly that there is no alternative but to prepare plansHHJ which would allow the Government of the day, so far as time permitted, BVAHHJ facilities were available, and the situation demanded it, to put into operation HHJAAA a second phase of evacuation designed to enable further measures of evacua- HHJHHJ tion to be carried out by stages.    The second phase Would not be planned inHHJ the same detail as the first.    It would be a makeshift and imply no assurance HHJHHJ of billets in houses in the reception areas.    How far it could be carried out HHJHHJ would remain to a great extent speculative.    Part of it might well consistHHJ of schemes for the re-deployment of labour, such as the emergency ports ^HHHHJ scheme, though the numbers involved in such schemes would probably beHAA marginal only. HHJHHJ 8.       The difficulty of indicating that the Government contemplate further HHJHHJ measures of evacuation after the evacuation of the priority classes is that it HHJHHl would be taken as implying that the Government think the right policy is to ^^HHHJ evacuate as many as possible from the evacuation areas.    Once this impression HHJAAA I got abroad, it would be difficult to persuade people in the evacuation areas to HHJHHJ           stay put until the Government made facilities available and there is moreHHJ than a likelihood of a &quot;sauve qui peut&quot; stampede which would bring the economic HHJHHJ        I life of the nation to a standstill.    Nor can the effect on the morale of our ^^HAAA        I nation and Allies be overlooked.    And finally there is a danger that we should AAAJAAA        I so discourage the civil defence volunteers in the areas scheduled for evacua- AAA^^H AAV tion that they would lose heart and might refuse to play any further part; it ^^HHHJ        I might indeed lead immediately to the disintegration of the Civil DefenceHHJ       I organisation. HHJ
9. The Ministerial Committee have approved the opening of discussionswith local authorities, and these will be initiated after the Defence debate inMarch.    V/e are not agreed, however, on the desirability of disclosing atthis stage the extent to which we have it in mind to make plans for evacuating ?TaTaTJmore than the priority classes.    The issue resolves itself into whether to.^H&apos;     include in the forthcoming Statement on Defence the sentence in brackets inparagraph 2(ii) of C. P. (56) 30.10. This is a matter of much wider significance than the need to get onwith the preparation of an evacuation scheme, important though that is.Advice cannot be given to civil defence authorities, to industry or to thepublic about the precautionary measures they should take until it has beendecided in broad terms whether national policy should be based on &quot;stay put&quot;in the industrial areas (after the priority classes have left), subject to anydecision on further evacuation that might be made by the Government of theday, or on the near-total evacuation of these areas.    My own view is thatthis broad question of policy should be considered by the Defence Committee LVaHbefore discussions with the local authorities are begun.    If this is agreed,my colleagues may feel that the sentences in square brackets should beomitted from the Defence White Paper.Home Office, S. W. 1.B^B^Bs B^B^H8th February, 1956,HI 1 I
