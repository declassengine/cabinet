secret.P.(56) 4721 st February, 1956CABINET-FEDERATION OF MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies attach at Annex A a copy of the agreed Report of theConference on Constitutional Advance in Malaya, and at Annex B an extract from the Report of the General Purposes Committee of theConference, as approved by the Conference in Plenary Session, containingmaterial relating to the proposed Constitutional Commission which was not included in the Report of the Conference as a whole.     The Report of theConference contains a number of typographical and other minor errorswhich have been corrected for publication of the Report as a White paper in, I hope, the next two to three weeks.    I do not expect my colleagues to read these two documents in full, and I therefore also attach at annex C notes upon those recommendations of the Conference to whichI think it necessary expressly to draw their attention.2. The Conference was undoubtedly a success.     Its Report dealswith all the issues which we set out to settle;  and the conclusions andrecommendations upon them are comprehensive and free from ambiguity..Agreement was reached on all points within the limits authorised by theCabinet on 17th January (C0M0(56) 4th Conclusions, Minute 3).    these agreements are far-reaching, but we had all recognised beforehand thatit was right to go a long way in order to obtain an amicable settlement,and they include satisfactory safeguards for all our vital interests.     Thebusiness of the Conference was throughout conducted in an atmosphere of goodwill and I have no doubt mat the Malayan Delegation has returnedto the Federation with feelings of genuine cordiality towards Her Majesty rsGovernment and the British people.    In a farewell letter to me TunkuAbdul Rahman, the. Chief Minister, wrote&quot;We feel, as we return, that there hasbeen laid down a most excellent basis for the continuedimprovement of relations between the United Kingdomand a self-governing Malaya within the commonwealth and for increased friendship and understanding between our two peoples.    I can assure you of my personalco-operation and support on all matters agreed upon&quot;.It is,, above all, upon this goodwill and co-operation that we must infuture depend for the security of British and Commonwealth interests inthe Federation of Malaya.3. I have already sent the High Commissioner a despatch asking him to convey the Report of the Conference to Their Highnesses the Rulersand to ask them to express their views upon it.     The Conference of RulersCOPY NO. 5 .1
is to meet for this purpose on Tuesday, 28th February.    Since theReport was unanimously agreed by the entire Delegation, including therepresentatives of the Rulers, I expect Their Highnesses to endorse it.I have told the High Commissioner that I hope before 28th February toinform him by telegram of the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government uponthe Report;   and I have said that, should Her Majestyrs Governmentapprove its recommendations, I would propose, if those recommendations are also approved by the Conference of Rulers, to submit them toThe Queen for Her Majesty&apos;s approval.4. I therefore ask my colleagues to approve the Report of theConference, including the proposals for the Constitutional Commissioncontained in the Report of the General Purposes Committee of theConference.    As I have said above, those conclusions and recomrnend-ations to which I think it necessary expressly to draw my colleagues1attention are set out in Annex C.A.

REPORT OF THE FEDERATION OF MALAYACONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCEHELD IN LONDONJANUARY AND FEBRUARY,  1956IN
REPORT BY THE FEDERATION OP MALAYA CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCEHeld in London in. January,and February, 1956I.    introduction the constitution of the Federation of Malaya was set out in theFederation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, made be Ween His late Majesty King George vTand Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States. . The preamble to the Agreementrecorded their desire that x^rogress should be made towards eventual self-government,and envisaged that, as a first step to that end, legislation should be introduced assoon as circumstances and local conditions permitted for the election of members tothe several legislatures (i.e. the Federal Legislative Council and the State and settlement Councils),,    Unfortunately, within a few months from the signing of that agreement, the communists started their armed attack on the civil population and thefabric of government in the Federation.   This delayed the introduction of the elec-tions contemplated in the Agreement, although it was possible in 1951 to introduce,under the &quot;Membership system&quot;, some devolution of authority by giving unofficial members of the Executive Council responsibility for certain Departments andsubjects.    It was not until 1953 that the improvement in the security situationmade it possible to introduce the measures necessary to put in hand elections to theFederal Legislative Council and to the State and Settlement Legislatures.   while these measures were under consideration the Alliance* pressed for an effectivemajority of elected members in the Legislative Council;    and in 1954 a number oftheir representatives, led by Tunku Abdul Rahman visited London and-urged their viewsupon the then Secretary of State for the Colonies.2.     In the Federal elections, which took place in July, 1955, the Alliance secured51 out of the 52 seats for elected members in the Legislative Council,   Bothbefore and after the elections the Alliance made clear its desire for further constitutional advance at an early stage, and when the Secretary of State for theColonies visited the Federation in August, 1955, he held discussions withTheir Highnesses the Rulers and with the new Alliance Ministers on the next steps tobe taken in the direction of self-government for the Federation,    As a result ofthese discussions it was agreed that a Conference should be held in London early in1956 to discuss the future relations which should exist between Her majesty&apos;s government, Their Highnesses the Rulers and the Government of the Federation, andcertain fundamental issues such as defence and internal security, finance andeconomic development and the future of the public services.   It was also agreed inprinciple between Her Majesty&apos;s Government, Their Highnesses the Rulers and theGovernment of the Federation that a Commission should be appointed to review theconstitution of the Federation, and that the terms of reference, composition and timing of this Commission should be discussed at the Conference and recommendations made thereon to Her Majesty the Queen and the Conference of Rulers.II.    THE CONFERENCE3.     The Conference accordingly met in London from 18th January to 6th February, 1956.It was attended by a Delegation from the Federation of Malaya consisting of four representatives of Their Highnesses the Rulers and the Chief Minister and three other Alliance Ministers.   In addition, the High Commissioner for the Federation of malaya, accompanied by some of his senior advisers, was in attendance.   A list ofthose taking part is contained at Appendix A.4.&apos;     In opening the Conference the Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Rt. Hon. Alan Lennox-Boyd, said that it was almost exactly eight years since the Federation Agreement was signed.    The Conference was agreed on the direc-tion of the progress which it&apos;wanted to makej    this was to seoure the earlyestablishment of a fully self-governing and independent Federation of Malaya withinthe Commonwealth on the basis of parliamentary institutions.    This was not only apolitical problem, but also an administrative task of some magnitude and complexity,* The Alliance is composed of the United Malays&apos; National Organisation (UMNO), the malayan Chinese Association (MRCA), and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC).
He assured the Federation Delegation that in the constitutional and other develop^.-which lay ahead it would always be the desire of Her Majestyls Government toco-operate with the Federation Government in building a stable country.5. &apos;   In reply, the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya put forward theproposals which the Malayan Delegation desired the Conference to consider withspecial reference to the financial position, internal defence and security, thepublic services and the Constitutional Commission.   The Conference agreed that theseproposals should form the basis of its work and agreed to set up Committees to under-take detailed examination of the problems involved.6.     Our conclusions, which are set out below, are subject to approval by her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Conference of Rulers.Effect can be given to some of our recommendations by administrative action, butothers involve legislation, including in some cases amendment to the FederationAgreement and other constitutional instruments.III.   DEFENCE AND INTERNAL SECURITY7.     Throughout our discussion of the problems of defence and internal security wehave drawn a distinction between  two stages of constitutional development inthe Federation of Malaya;    the interim period before full self-government, duringwhich Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will continue to exercisecertain important responsibilities in respect of the Federation;    and the final stage of full self-government and independence within the Commonwealth.   We have so framedour proposals for the interim period that, as well as reflecting the distribution ofresponsibility between Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and MalayanMinisters during that period, they will be capable of being continued into the stage of full self-government with the minimum of administrative and other disturbance.Our object has been to reconcile the factors of continuity and efficiency on the onehand, with recognition of the evolving political facts of the situation on the other,(a) The Interim Period8e     We agree that the member of the Government responsible in the Executive and legislative Councils for matters of internal defence and security should, in place of the Secretary for Defence, be a Malayan Minister who should be styledMinister for Internal Defence and Security.   We agree also that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment through the High Commissioner should retain during the interim periodfull responsibility for external defence;    and we consider that it would be appropriate that the High Commissioner should himself bring to Executive Council for advice or information matters relating to external defence and that theChief Secretary should answer for these matters in Legislative Council.9.     The requirements of internal defence and security in the interim period need tobe considered in two aspects;    the arrangements for handling operations duringthe remainder of the Emergency and the transfer of the administration of the localinternal security forces, which should be put in hand forthwith.Emergency Operations10,   With regard to the remainder of the period of Emergency we agree that it is consistent with the present stage of political development of the Federationthat there should be some change in the arrangements for concerting the operations of the armed forces, the police and the several civil departments and agenciesinvolved.    To this end we agree that the present Committee of which the Director of operations is Chairman should be replaced by an Emergency Operations Council, withthe Minister for Internal Defence and Security as Chairman and including theDirector of Operations among its members.    The forces required for the prosecution of the Emergency would remain under the operational command of the Director of operations and would be used to aid the civil authorities in giving effect to direc-tions of the Emergency Operations Council made in pursuance of policy as laid down from time to time in Executive Council,,    The Emergency Operations Council, like thepost of Director of Operations itself, will be temporary and is not expected tooutlast the Emergency,   We recognise, however, that continuing arrangements will berequired, also in the context of general policy as determined in Executive Council,for countering the threat of communist subversion.
Administration of the Armed Forces of theFederation;    a Pedera fa ion Amed Forces CouncilHo    We agree that steps should be taken to enable the, Federation armed forces tobe administratively self-contained.    At present their administration isintegrated with that of the United Kingdom forces, and is largely carried out byHeadquarters Malaya on behalf of the Federation Government,    The process of settingup self-contained administrative machinery for the Federation forces must take time,but meanwhile there should be set up forthwith on a statutory basis&apos;a FederationArmed Forces Council, which would be a permanent body, quite distinct from theEmergency Operations Council discussed in paragraph 10,    The process cf building upthe necessary administrative substructure will be carried out under the aegis and direction of this body,12,    The functions, of the Council and the distribution of responsibilities to itsindividual members will broadly correspond to the practice obtaining in theArmy and Air Councils in the United Kingdom,    The membership of the Council will atfirst be:-The Minister for Internal Defence and Security - Chairman;A representative of Their Highnesses the Rulers;The General Officer Commanding the Federation Army (who would be seconded by her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and be appointed by and, beresponsible to the Federation Government);Two other professional members corresponding to the United KingdomAdjutant-General (who deals with personnel matters) and Quartermaster-General(who deals with stores arid equipment);The senior civil servant&apos;in the Ministry of Internal Defence and. Security,A representative of Headquarters Malaya will be available to attend when required so long as the Federation army is dependent on administrative support fromHeadquarters Malaya,   We&apos; consider that this Council should handle administrativequestions concerning the existing and future Federation Naval and Air Forces as wellas Army matters,13*    In the light of the provisions and practice in the United Kingdom regarding the handling of Service matters, we consider that the following principles are applicable to the Federation:-(i) the armed &quot;forces are forces of the State (as represented by the Head ofState) and are raised and maintained by the Head of State in accordance withlegislative authority;(ii)    so far as the armed forces themselves are concerned, their affairs willbe regulated by the Armed. Forces Council and not by any individual:(iii)    sq far as the Executive and Legislative Councils are concerned, theMinister, as Chairman of the Armed Forces Council, will be responsible forthe administration of the armed forces;(iv)    subject to the Minister&apos;s general responsibility to the Head of State, onwhose authority all appointments are made, personnel matters will in practice be dealt with, up to a certain level, by the professional member of the armed Forces Council corresponding to the Adjutant-General in the UnitedKingdom, and beyond that level, in relation to very senior pests, by consultation between the Head of State, the Minister and the senior Serviceadvisers of the Government^,(v) the Armed Forces Council, in accordance with United Kingdom practice, willnot direct the operational use of the armed forces. Policy decisions governing the use of the forces will be taken in Executive Councils
The Position of UK and Commonwealth Armed Forces in the Federation14.   We recogni.se that in the interim period Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom will continue to have direct responsibility for the external defence and external relations of the Federation, and that they will thereforeretain in the Federation the forces which they consider necessary for the external defence of the tei-ritory and for the fulfilment of their Commonwealth and international obligations.   To this end they will require in the Federation thefacilities needed for the maintenance of those forces, which include theCommonwealth Strategic Reserve.15,   We agree that provision should be made for consultation between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of the Federation on matters arising from the stationing of United Kingdom and Commonwealth forces in the Federation.,   Thisshould take the form of an understanding that, except in circumstances whenimmediate action would be essential, e,g. in war or a serious emergency, theFederation Government should be informed in advance of any proposed substantial changes in the size or character of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth forces inthe Federation, and given an effective opportunity of making such representationsas they wished,,   We recognise that in the discharge of their responsibilityHer Majesty&apos;s Government will be bound to consider their arrangements for thedefence of Malaya against the background of general defence policy, and cannot therefore undertake to make their dispositions subject to the approval of theFederation Government, whose views will however receive the fullest consideration.*External Defence Committee16.   To facilitate the handling of such matters, and to prepare the way for thetime when, on the advent of full self-government, responsibility for external defence passes to the Federation Government, we agree that there shall be set up aCommittee to discuss and advise on questions relating to the external defence ofthe Federation.   The Chairman of this Committee should, in view of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s responsibility for external defence, be the High Commissioner, andits membership should include the Minister for Internal Defence and Security;the Chief Secretary and a number of other Ministers;    the General Officer andAir Officer Commanding United Kingdom forces;    and the senior civil servantresponsible to the High Commissioner for matters of external defence.   TheCommittee will be a temporary body, designed to meet a need peculiar to the interim period.The Police Force17.   We agree that the needs of the interim period are to maintain the force ata high level of operational efficiency, particularly for the rest of theEmergenoy;    to prepare the way for a smooth run-down of the force to normal pro-portions thereafter;    to establish a system of administration (especially on the personnel side) suitable for continuance into the stage of full self-governmentand independence within the Commonwealth;    and to allow due scope for a policy ofMalayanisation without damage to the efficiency and morale of the force as a whole.18,   As regards operations, during the remainder of the Emergency elements of theforce will form part of the resources available under the general directionof the Emergency Operations Council (see paragraph 10 above).   In normal times the force will be largely self-directing, under its own professional head, since its duties are for the most part laid down by statute.19*   Operations apart, we distinguish two categories of questions affecting thepolice:   general problems of the structure, size, organisation, powers,duties and i^emuncration of the force;    and personnel problems, such as appoint-ments, promotions and discipline.   We recognise that the former are questions ofpolicy and require settlement in Executive Council or by the Head of State.20.   Personnel matters, however, so far as individual members of the force areconcerned, are administrative in character.   Later in this Report we make recommendations in respect of the administration of personnel matters in thepublic service generally;    these include the establishment of a Public service commission.   There are, however, special considerations affecting the police force, and we therefore recommend that at an appropriate time there should be
^itablished a separate Police Service Commission to deal with appointments,promotions and discipline in the higher ranks of the force;    the commission should be set up on a statutory basis and should have executive authority,   its functions and membership are set out in Appendix C.21,   In preparation for the setting up of a Police Service Commission with executive powers we agree that there should be instituted for the police, as soon as thenecessary administrative arrangements can be made, a body parallel to the presentAppointments and Promotions Bos.rd which has for some years operated for other branches of the public service;    it should be set up by administrative action andshould have the same advisory functions.   Use might be made of the facilities, andto some extent the membership, of the present Board, always bearing in mind thespecial needs of the police service.   By this means valuable experience could beobtained and time would be afforded for the police force itself to gain confidence in this new machinery before personnel matters become the province of a commission with executive powers.22,   We make no specific recommendations on the exact date on which the police service Commission should be set up.   This should be considered in due courseby the Federation Government in consultation with its professional advisers, in thelight of the circumstances of the Emergency then prevailing.   There are, however,strong grounds in favour of synchronising action with that taken for the rest ofthe public service,23.   In accordance with the recommendations which we have made later in this reportfor dealing with premature retirement, the compensation scheme applicable tothe public service as a whole should be applied to the police force as soon as thePolice Service Commission is set up.2J+.   We, considered the question of the Malayanisation of the police force, to theextent that it was possible to do so in advance of the findings of theCommittee which is now at work on the problem in Malaya.   In general we agreethat for the purposes of the police force such a policy should be effected!-(a) by controlling entry into the force, according to present practice;(b) as regards personnel already in the force, by observing the normalservice principles for promotion and by relying for increased opportunities for promotion of Malayan Officers on the operation of the scheme for prematureretirement set out later in the report.(b)    Full Self-government and Independence within the Commonwealth&apos;25. . In the final stage a fully self-governing Federation of Malaya will beresponsible for external defence as for all other functions of government,.We have agreed, however, that at that time there shall be an agreement between her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of a fully self-&apos;governing Federation making provision for defence requirements and mutual assistancein defence matters.Defence and Mutual Assistance Treaty26.   The Government of the Federation of Malaya will afford to Her Majesty1 sGovernment in the United Kingdom the right to maintain in the Federation theforces necessary for the fulfilment of Commonwealth and international obligations;and Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will undertake to assist theGovernment of the Federation in the external defence of its territory.Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will continue to be affordedfacilities needed in the Federation for the maintenance and support of these forces;    they will include the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, which would remainin the Federation,   Provision will be made for consultation by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment with the Federation Government in regard to the exercise of their rights under the Treaty.27,   We agree that the details of this Treaty should be studied and worked out bya Working Party in the Federation to be set up as soon as possible consistingof a number of representatives of Her Majestyfs Government on the one hand and thesame number of representatives of the Conference of Rulers and the federation government on the ether.   We consider that the Commissioner General for the
&quot;.   ZB2 &apos; &apos;United Kingdom in South East Asia should be Chairman, and that the Australian anaNew Zealand Governments should be invited to nominate observers at its meetings,The Terms of Reference of the Working Party are set out at Appendix D.IV.   FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC MATTOB328. &apos; On the subject of the machinery of Government relating to the administrationof financial and economic affairs, we agree that the responsibility for allfinancial matters, including foreign exchange, at present discharged by theFinancial Secretary, should be transferred at once to a Malayan. Minister ofFinance,   We recognise that, during the interim period, the United Kingdom willpossess a continuing interest in the mechanism of financial control in theFederation in order to be satisfied, that the expenditure of money made available from United Kingdom funds is properly controlled, but we are satisfied that thereare no objections on financial grounds to this proposal.   We are also agreed thata Ministry of Commerce and Industry should be set up to take over some of thefunctions at present exercised by the Minister for Economic Affairs, which titlewould lapse.290   We recognise that ultimate responsibility for policy will rest with theExecutive Council, and we welcome the proposal to establish, under the chair-manship of the Chief Minister, an Economic Committee of the Executive Council,charged, with the responsibility of coordinating economic policy and determiningpriorities, in the belief that such a Committee will greatly assist and strengthen the work of government,30.   We had a full and frank discussion of the Federation1s position in the sterling Area, The Malayan Delegation indicated, that it was the view oftheir Government that membership of the Sterling Area was to the common advantageof the Federation and the other members and that it was their intention to remainin it after attaining full self-government * There was general recognition by theUnited. Kingdom representatives of the importance of the Federation&apos;s contributionto the strength of the Sterling Area through the direct earnings of dollars fromrubber and tin.31*   -We discussed the question of responsibility for the Federation&apos;s foreign exchange policy with particular reference to dollar imports,   We recognisethat the existing arrangements for consultation between the Government of theFederation and Her Majesty&apos;s Government   have on the whole worked wall in practice.There was a general discussion on the common problems of the Sterling Area and itwas agreed that, so long as the problem of the balance of payments cf the area, asa whole remained, it would be necessary for the Government of the Federation tocontinue to exercise restraint in its dollar expenditure in conformity with thepolicy generally followed by the Sterling Area.   We agree that the responsibilityfor applying this policy in the Federation rests with the Federation Governmentand that the Federation Government will continue to consult with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment so that it can act in full knowledge of Sterling Area problems andthe United Kingdom can be fully informed, of the special problems of the Federation,32,   In view of the Federation&apos;s participation in the Sterling Area and theinportance of its trade to the Area&apos;3 strength, it was agreed that theFederation Government must be able to assure the people of the Federation that thevoice of their elected representatives  .would be heard, in matters of Sterling Areapolicy.   We agreed that, In order to achieve this, it was des.ira.ble that arrange-ments should be made for the Government of the Federation to send a delegate to all future meetings of Commonwealth Finance Ministers on a basis which would enable himto have full freedom of expression and full discretion, at such Conferences in all matters which fall within the responsibility of the Federation Government,   TheFederation Delegation agreed not to press the matter of the precise constitutional status of the Federation&apos;s   delegate at such Conferences further at the presenttime, but it was agreed that the Federation Government would be entitled to raiseit again should occasion arise later.33a   We recognise the important part which overseas capital must continue to play in the economic and social development of Malaya,   In this connection wethink it desirable to draw attention to the statement in the Alliance Manifestothat it is their policy to attract overseas capital to Malaya.   This was givenmore detailed expression in the High Commissioner&apos;s statement in the.(31613)
v\^gislative Council on the 30th November, 1955, in which he stated that theFederation Government looked with confidence to the establishment of happy relation-ships and a full sense of partnership between a fully self-governing Malaya and overseas industry and enterprise genuinely interested in the development on soundlines of the country&quot;s productive resources.   To this end it was, and would remain,their policy to encourage overseas investment, industry and enterprise to look to malaya with every assurance of fair and considerate treatment and -without fear ofdisorimination.   The relevant extract from the High Commissioner^ address is contained at Appendix F.34*   Regarding the future financial relationship between the United Kingdom and theFederation of Malaya, we agree that it is most important that the federation should go forward to full self-government in circumstances which will give a fairassurance of its future financial stability. In this context, we recognise fully the vitally important position of the Federation in the world-wide struggle againstcommunism and the faot that operations in the military sphere must be backed by a sound and vigorous programme of economic and social development.35*   During the interim period Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to help theFederation should it beoome clear that, having regard to the necessity for theFederation Government to make provision for an expanded programme of economic and social development and to the need to maintain reserves at the right level as a precaution against possible fluctuations in the prices of rubber and tin beforethe Federation&apos;s rubber replanting schemes bear fruit, there is a need for financialassistance from the United Kingdom towards the cost of the Emergency.   To this endwe agree that a meeting should be held as soon as possible between the UnitedKingdom and Federation Governments with a view to determining the necessity forsuch assistance.36,   It is recognised that the attainment of full self-government implies theprinciple of financial self-sufficiency.   Nevertheless, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognise the common interest of both Governments in bringing theEmergency to an end,.  For this reason, if the Emergency has not been brought to anend by the time that full self-government and independence within the Commonweal.this attained, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will still be prepared to consider with theFederation Government -whether the financial needs of the Federation would justifyspecial assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government towards meeting the cost of theEmergency over and above the substantial assistance which will continue to be giventhrough the forces and services provided by the United Kingdom to sustain the fight against the Communist terrorists,37*   In any event, substantial help will still be available from the United Kingdomafter the attainment of full self-government within the Commonwealth, asfollows: -(i)    Apart from their continuing commitments in the Federation in respect ofits external defence, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will maintain their undertaking to finance certain capital costs of expansion of the Federation Armed Forcesin an agreed programme;(ii)    Her Majesty&apos;s Government will at all -times be ready to examine sympatheti-cally with the Federation its borrowing needs on the London market in conneotionwith its development plans;(iii)    If, at the time when the Federation attains full self-government withinthe Commonwealth, there is any unspent balance of allocations made to theFederation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, the approval ofParliament will be sought to enable an amount equivalent to any such balanceto be made available to the Federation for development expenditure;(iv)   Her Majesty&apos;s Government will stand by their undertaking to provideassistance, subject to the approval of Parliament in the form of a loan tothe Federation to enable it to finance its contribution to the Tin Buffer Stockshould it be unable to obtain the necessary loan finance from any other suitablesource.
THE PUBLIC SERVICE9 P ilC u 438,   We accept the thesis that in a self-governing country the publio service must &apos;be solely under the authority of the government of that country and that therecan be 40: question of any external control.     In these circumstances, we wish toplace on record certain principles which we consider should guide any government inexercising control of its publio servioe,39*   An efficient and contented public service is an essential foundation of good government.     This may be said to apply at all stages of constitutional development and it is of particular importance during a time of rapid politicalohange.    Ministers must be aisle to rely on reoeiving informed and impartialadvioe from experienced officials before reaching policy decisions.     They mustequally be able to rely on their officials to see that their policy decisions, oncetaken, are carried out with loyalty, speed and efficiency.40,   The first essential for ensuring an efficient administration is that the .politioal impartiality of the publio service should be recognised and safe*-guarded.     Experience has shown that this is best secured by recognising theservice as a corporate body owing its allegiance to the Head of State and scretaining its continuous existence irrespective of changes in the politioal 00m-plexion of the government of the day.     The publio service is necessarily andrightly subjeot to ministerial direction and control in the determination and execution of government policy, but in order to dpftheir job effectively publioservants must feel free to tender advioe to Ministers, without fear or favour,aooortling to their conscience and to their view of the merits of a case.     Whetheror not that advice is taken is entirely for Ministers to decide but, ence decisions have been taken, it is the undoubted duty of the public servant to give his prompt and wholehearted co-operation in carrying them out,     The essential role of thepublic service would be gravely impaired if its members had any cause to feel thattheir personal position or prospects might be affected as a result of the advicewhioh they felt it their duty to give.     In order to discharge their roleeffectively, public servants should know that their service oonditions and prospects are not subject to political or personal influence of any kind.     This is not least in the interests of Ministers and politicians themselves,41.   A publio service is rightly regarded as a profession holding cut prospects ofa career covering the working life of its members.     One of the most essentialingredients of a contented and efficient service is that promotions policy shouldbe regulated in accordance with publicly recognised professional principles.     TheService must feel confident that promotions will be determined impartially on thebasis of official qualifications, experience and merit.     Any departure from these principles which might suggest that promotions were in any way subjeot to politioalor other outside influence, or that extraneous considerations were being takeninto account whioh were designed to give special preference to particular individual -duals or sections in the Service, would be certain to undermine Service morale.42,   Similarly, a reasonable security of tenure and an absolute freedom from the arbitrary application of disciplinary provisions are essential foundations ofa publio service.     Without them, a service would fail to attract and retainsufficient officers of the requisite calibre and Ministers would not be able to depend on reoeiving frank and objective advice*     Disciplinary provisions, includingthe power to dismiss an officer on grounds of misconduct or gross inefficiency are,of oourse, necessary in any service but it is generally aooepted that these pro-&quot;visions should be applied with complete impartiality and In accordance withestablished servioe principles and procedures, and should be reoognised by theService as a -whole to be both fair and fairly exercised.43*   The most generally aooepted method of ensuring the observance of the foregoingprinciples is by the establishment of an Independent Public Servioe Commission.There is already a Publio Servioe Appointments and Promotions Board in theFederation oif Malaya, and the establishment of a Publio Service Commission, is underconsideration.    We agree that the Coimmission should be established as soon aspossible and that provision should be made for it in the Federation Agreement,
&apos;2 HP Details will have to be worked out in the Federation, but we agree that thefollowing principles should be observed: -(a) it is of vital importance that the Public Service Commission should be independent and free from political influence;(b) the members of the Public Service Commission should be appointed by theHigh Commissioner, in his discretion, after consultation with the chief minister;(o)   taking advantage of experience elsewhere, care should be taken indelineating the respective functions of the Public Service Commission andthose of government in relation to the public service, the broad principlebeing that the government and legislature are necessarily responsible for fixing establishments and terms of employment while the Public service commission is charged with the internal administration of the service as a professional body and with the responsibility for public service mattersincluding appointments, promotions and the applicaticn, when necessary, of disciplinary prorvisions in respeot of members of the publio servioejV(d) members should be carefully chosen to be widely representative but shouldbe men capable of working as a team and not speaking merely for sectionalinterest;(e) The Chairman should be a person who will command the respect both ofgovernment and of the Service and should be given the authority and standingnecessary to establish the Oomnission as an important and respected nationalinstitution,45*   We have agreed that the Public Service Commission should exercise its responsi-*bilities in respeot of all branches of the service other than the Judiciaryand the Police,     We have agreed to the establishment of a Judicial service commission (Appendix B) and a Police Service Commission (Appendix C) %     Theconfirmation scheme outlined later in the Report will apply to the Judiciary as wellas to other branches of the publio service,46.   In view of the political development of the Federation, the Publio service commission should be given executive powers as soon as it is established.     By&quot;executive powers&quot; we mean that the High Commissioner would act on the Commissionsrecommendations, although, in the light of experience elsewhere, we think it wouldbe prudent for him to have the right to refer baok, once and once only, any recommendation-mendation which in his view required further consideration,47*   It will  inevitably take some time to set up the Publio Service Commission asan independent statutory body.    We agree that it should be formally established as from the 1st July, 1957, but that, meanwhile, in order that they may gainexperience, the Chairman and members should be designated and should take over in an advisory oapaoity the responsibilities of the existing Promotions and AppointmentsBoard, with terms of reference, extended as necessary, to cover the subjects whichwill be dealt with by the Public Service Commission,48,   We oonsider that If their conditions of service are protected by the establish-ment of a Publio Service Commission and it is made clear&apos; that traditionalservice principles will be maintained, a large proportion of overseas officers will wish to remain in the Federation and to continue to give loyal and devoted service to the country.     We recognise, however, that the new circumstances brought about byconstitutional change fundamentally vary the conditions under which a large sectionof the publio &apos; service was recruited and that such officers have a right to bo giventhe. opportunity to leave the service on appropriate terms,49*   Before we elaborate our proposals on this point we think it may be helpful to define certain of the terms -which wr? use in the following paragraphs.
&quot;Entitled Officer&quot; means an officer in receipt of expatriation pay who is    &quot;serving (otherwise than on contract or agreement for a specified period) ina public offioe in the Federation of Malaya.     The expression should also betaken to include any locally*-domioiled offioer holding his appointment byapproval of the Secretary of State for1 the Colonies who can show to the satis*faction of the Secretary of State that he has reasonable grounds for anxietyover the future of his career in the publio servioe,&quot;Earned pension&quot; means the pension or reduced pension and gratuity which anentitled offioer would be eligible to receive under existing Pensions Regula-tions but not subject to the usual ten-year period of qualifying servioe,&quot;Additional allowance&quot; means a supplementary pensior calculated at a specifiedrate additional to earned pension.&quot;Lump-sum compensation&quot; means the payment of a sum of money as compensationfor the loss sustained by. an officer on the premature termination of hiscareer.50.   We recognise two clearly defined phases.     Phase I is the situation as atpresent.     We agree that the assumption of office by the Alliance Governmentin August, 1955, coupled with the break-up of the Malayan Establishment in July,1954-* constituted a major change in the conditions of service of overseas officers.We do not consider that this change in conditions is sufficiently radical to warrantpayment of an additional allowance or lump-sum compensation to any officers who now wish to leave the Federation Servioe, but we do consider that it justifies their being allowed to go on acorued pension.     We have therefore agreed that a Phase Isoheme should be introduced at once and that under it an entitled officer should beallowed to retire at any time after reasonable notice and with the permission of theHigh Commissioner, acting in his discretion, and that such permission should not be withheld unless proceedings for the offioer&apos;s dismissal are being taken or are about to be taken,51.   Phase II will begin when the Publio Service Commission is established with executive powers.     Since this will involve a radical ohange in the conditionsof service of the publio service we agree that at that point a full lump-sum oompen-sation scheme for loss of career should be brought into operation,52.   We have not considered it to be part of our task to attempt to draw up thissoheme in detail.     Not only would this not be possible in the absence ofcertain actuarial information but we consider that, once the principles of such ascheme have been accepted by the Federation Government, details should be worked outin the Federation in consultation with the representatives of the Staff Associationsooncerned.     For this reason we do not wish to comment on the various points of detail which we discussed with the representatives of the Staff Associations whom weinvited to give evidence during the Conference, but we consider that negotiations between the Federation Government and the Staff Associations concerned should beginat once,53,   We agree that the compensation soheme should provide that on retirement anentitled offioer should receive his earned pension plus at his option eitheran additional allowance or lump-sum compensation.     The amount of lump-sum oompensa-tion will  have to be worked out actuarially having regard to certain factors suchas age and, possibly, length of servioe, but the scheme should contain a provision whereby officers whose services it is particularly desired to retain in theFederation Servioe will be able during a specified period (e.g, four years) to&quot;freeze&quot; their entitlement to lump-sum compensation at the point in the actuarialtable which is most advantageous to them during that period.     We agree that theGovernment should also give consideration to other inducements which might be offered to offioers whose services it is partlJiUarly desired to retain, in addi-tion to the normal compensation,54-*   We have agreed that the right to retire on compensation should he exeroisableat their option by all entitled officers on giving due notice.55.   We have given careful consideration to the question whether, after Phase IIhas started, the Federation Government should be able to require officers to retire, at its discretion, or whether the compensation soheme should be entirelyvoluntary.(51813)10
lie have agreed that if officers are given the right to retire at will,it is logioal that government; should have the right to require officers to retire.     But there is a risk that if in practice the Government makes itclear that it intends to exercise that right, many valuable officers willopt to go,     Whatever inducements the Government may offer to certainofficers to stay, all officers will feel that sooner or later their services may he dispensed with and many of the best, who can most easily obtain otherattractive employment^ are likely to leave as soon as- possible.     To insistoh the right to dispense with the servioes of pensionable rfficers wouldalso weaken the effect both cf the other assuranoes which we have agreed begiven regarding service conditions, promotion and discipline and of any scheme of inducement allowance,     Malayanisation need not be prejudicedbecause, whatever assurances are given, many entitled officers are certain toopt to retire under the provisions cf a compensation scheme immediately it is introduced.     Others will do so later.     Normal retirements on grounds of agewill continue.     Other officers are likely to be transferred to other terri-tories and the Secretary of State for the Colonies will do his best to trans-fer any officer at the request of the Federation Government.     Meanwhile, no new overseas officers will be recruited on pensionable terms unless theFederation Government specifically so request, and the existing powers to dispense with the services of officers on abolition of office or on suchgrounds as gross inefficiency and misconduct will remain.     The praoticalproblem which might arise is not whether there will be full scope forMalayanisation but whether it will be possible to retain and recruit enoughqualified officers to provide the Federation Government with the efficient,experienced and stable adraini.stration which it will need for carrying out itspolicies during the coming vital years.57*   While it is recognised that a feeling of insecurity will tend to make- valuable officers leave the Federation earlier than they might otherwise have done, we consider that the adoption of the scheme outlined in the nextparagraph should go far to mitigate this disadvantage,58.   After consideration of various alternatives, we have agreed on thefollowing plan:(i)    The Public Service Commission will be established with exeoutivepowers and a compensation scheme will be introduced with effect frcm the1st July, 1957.(ii)    The Federation Government will assure the public service that untilthe compenijation soheme is introduced no offioer will have his servicesdispensed with except in accordance with traditional service principles,(iii)   During the period between the presentation of the report of theMalayanisation Committee and the 1st July, 1957, every entitledexpatriate officer will be given the opportunity to say whether he wishes to be retained in the Servioe after the 1st July, 1957.     If hestates that he does, his case will be considered and he will be informed of the minimum period during -which he may expect, subject to health and efficiency, to be retained.     The periods will naturally vary accordingto the relevant circumstances, e,g,   the staffing position in theofficer&apos;s Department, including the. availability of suitably qualifiedlooal offioers, the officer&apos;s age and so forth.     In some cases it will no doubt be possible to assure officers- of employment up to normalretiring age;   in others a term of years may be stated, with or without;the possibility of further extension at the end of that term if theofficer then wishes it.     In other oases, it might not be possible togive&apos; the offioer any assurance.(31815)11
*i&apos; a? -o(iv)    It follows that the Government will not exercise the right, except ontraditional service principles, to retire any entitled officer during any period for which he had been promised employment.;   but the officer&apos;s right to retire (subject to due notice) under the compensation scheme will remainunaffected.59.   We have agreed that officers of Her Majesty1s Oversea Civil Service andJudiciary who remain in the Federation Service shall retain their eligibilityto be considered by the Secretary of State for transfer to other territories on theunderstanding that(a) the Secretary of State will not offer such officers transfers without prior consultation with the Federation Government;   and(b) the Federation Government for its part will not unreasonably withhold itsconsent to such transfers.We further agree that, in order to facilitate the transfer of officers to postswhich, in view of,.the high level of salaries in the Federation, might be less wellpaid than an officerrs existing post, consideration should be given to a schemewhereby an officer would receive a lump sum payment to compensate him for any drop in pensionable emoluments on transfer.60.   It was suggested by the Staff Associations that the abolition of certain seniorposts as the result of decisions taken by the Conference would affect prorao-tion prospects and would therefore constitute a further change in their conditionsof service sufficient to warrant the Immediate introduction of some measure of com-pensation   available to the public service as a whole.     We are unable to accept this contention.     The Federation Government possesses and must continue to possess the right, common to all governments, to abolish posts which ax-e no longer required.So long as only a limited number of specified posts are to be abolished, we do notconsider that this, in itself, would constitute a major change in the conditions ofservice of overseas officers but, in order to ivoid unsettling the service by open-ing the door to the arbitrary abolition of an unlimited number of posts, and inaccordance with the proposals in paragraph 58, we have agreed that the only poststo be abolished as a result of decisions taken by the Conference are those of theBritish Advisers and the Financial Secretary.     No further pensionable posts willbe abolished, except on clear grounds of redundancy, at least until the 1st July,1957.     Consideration will be given to applying to the holders of posts to be abolished now any compensation terms finally agreed for the service as a wholeinstead of existing abolition of office terms.61.   The Federation Government are very conscious of the difficult problem of fill-ing those vacancies for which local officers are not yet available but forwhich they will become available in a few years&apos; time.     The Malayan Delegation haveexpressed the hope that arrangements can be made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for thecreation of a central pool from which overseas officers could be made available to fill these posts on secondment terms for so long as they may be required.FINAL SECTION OF DRAFT REPORT BY. THEFEDERATION OF MALAYA CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE,TOGETHER WITH RELATED APPENDIX D.VI.     CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES62.   We have arrived at certain constitutional understandings affecting the positionof the High Commissioner and Executive Council, the composition of the executive and Legislative Councils and the withdrawal of the Eritish Advisers.     Those affect-ing the position of the High Commissioner and Executive Council require amendment of clauses 31 and 32 of the Federation Agreement, and agreed amended versions of these clauses are set out at Appendix E.63*   With   regard to the composition of the Executive and Legislative Councils, wehave agreed that Clause 23 of the Federation Agreement shall be amended to make provision for the office of Chief Minister and to provide that the members of
Executive Council other than the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General shall he appointed hy the High Commissioner after consultation with the Chief Minister.64.   We have also agreed on the following ministerial changes:-(i)   There will he an unofficial appointed as Minister of Finance and theFinancial Secretary will cease to be a member of the Executive and legislative Councils.     There will be an additional Nominated Member totake the place of the Financial Secretary in the Legislative Council, thusincreasing the number of Nominated Members from seven to eight, on theunderstanding that the additional seat will be used for the same purpose and appointment to it made in the same manner as apply to the otherNominated Members.(ii)   There will be a Minister for Commerce and Industry, who will be an unofficial, unless the Chief Minister should wish the post to be filled byan official, and he will take the place of the Minister for Economic Affairs.(iii)   An unofficial Minister for Internal Defence and Securi-fcy will become responsible for these matters in Executive and Legislative Councils and theSecretary for Defence will cease to be a member of either Council.6.5..   The Chief Secretary will be responsible for matters relating to the   publicservice, for the administrative work involved in the constitutional changes which will be taking place and for external affairs.66.,   Any Executive Council Papers on external defence will be submitted by theHigh Commissioner, who will have a senior official to work to him on that subject,,     The Chief Secretary will speak in the Legislative Council on external defence and will be a member of the External Defence Committee.67a   For the sake of greater flexibility in forming the Executive Council, theniinimum number of Appointed Members will be altered from 12 to 10. &apos;68.   As a result of the changes recommended above, Clauses 23 and 36 of theFederation Agreement will need to be amended.     These amendments, togetherwith others consequential changes in Parts III and IV of the Federation Agree-ment, are also set out in Appendix E.69*   We have considered the timing of these changes and have agreed that, where no amendment of the Federation Agreement or other legislation is renuired,they should be made as soon as possible after our recommendations have beenapproved by Her Majesty^ Government and the Conference of Rulers.     We alsoagree that the proposed changes in the Executive Council and Legislative council should b^ made as soon as the Federation Agreement can be amended to permit ofthem.     Until these amendments have been made the composition of these Councilswill remain unaltered,70,   The Conference considered the request of the Malayan Delegation for thewithdrawal of the British Advisers.     It was explained that the collectiveview of Their Highnesses the Rulers was that the time had come when the BritishAdvisers should be withdrawn.     Her Majesty1s Government do not wish to oppose this vieWc .71 n   We have agreed in principle that,  subject to the concurrence of TheirHighnesses the Rulers, the British Advisers will be withdrawn.     This will involve amendment of the State Agreements, and consequential amendments to theState Constitutions and the Federation Agreement.     Subject to the agreement ofthe Rulers   it is desirable that all the State Agreements shall be amended atthe same time, but provision will be made to enable the amendments to come intoforce on different dates.
72.    The   date for withdrawal of each of the British Advisers will be agreed bythe High Commissioner and each individual Ruler in the light of the circum-stances in each case, though it is understood, subject to the agreement of the ruler concerned, that the withdrawal will be completed within about a year,73*   In accordance with the agreements set out earlier in this Report, provision should be made in the Federation Agreement for:-(a) an independent Public Service Commission with executive authority;(b) an independent Judicial Service Commission with executive authority;(c) an independent Police Service Commission with executive authority;(d) a compensation scheme for loss of career;(e) the Federation Armed Forces Council,In respect of each of the Commissions detailed provisions not appropriate for inclusion in the Federation Agreement itself should be made by regulation orrule.     We think that such regulations or rules should be made by the Commissionconcerned and approved by the Executive Council,Constitutional Commission74,   We have agreed upon recommendations for the composition and terms ofreference of an independent Constitutional Commission and that this commission should be appointed as soon as possible.     In accordance with previously acceptedprocedure, these recommendations are being submitted to Her Majesty the Queen andto the Conference of Rulers,     The final, decisions will be published later,75,   We have further agreed that, in view of the Malayan Delegations desire that full self-government and independence within the Commonwealth should beproclaimed by August,  1957* if possible, a constitution so providing shall beintroduced at the earliest possible date consistent with the importance of thetask before the Constitutional Commission and that every effort will be made by her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Federation Government to achieve this by the timeproposed.

0m APPENDIX EOVERSEAS INVESTMENTEXTRACT PROM THE ADDRESS OF HIS BXCELIuENCY THE HIGH OCBMISSIOICBRDELIVERED TO THE FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL ONNOVEMBER 30th,, 1955am glad to say that Malaya has always enjoyed a good reputation in thepast as a reliable and creditworthy borrower, and to affirm that it is, and willremain, the policy of the present Government to maintain that reputation.11&quot;While I am discussing suoh issues,there is another matter to which I should refer, and that is the role of overseas capital and private enterprise in the presentand future development of the country*     It is common knowledge that external capital and private enterprise have played a conspicuous part in the development of the malayan economy, and it is no less than my duty at the present time of change andevolution in our political and constitutional affairs to make it clear that theFederation Government willingly recognises the contribution which overseas capital and enterprise have so made,,,to the economic and scoria! well-being of the country as a whole,&quot;&quot;It is also the view of the Federation Government - and I would remind you thatI speak today on behalf of the Government as now constituted - that such capital and enterprise have no less an important role to play in a new and independent Malaya ofthe future.     It is therefore, and will remain, the po3.icy of the Government to accord such industry and enterprise fair and considerate treatment j   to foster an atmosphere in which the overseas investor who is genuinely ooncerned with thedevelopment on sound lines of the country&apos;&apos; s px-oductive resources can invest andconduct undertakings in this country without fear of discrimination ox- unfairness;and, last but not least, to oontinue the present policy whereby the overseas investorcan, after payment of local taxes and obligations, remit to his country, within the framework of ordinary, and reasonable Exohange Control requirements, funds for thepayment of dividends and for the repatriation of his capital. &quot;&quot;In return, the new Government looks with confidence to those overseas enter-prises which work in this country to identify themselves closely with the interests,aspirations and  sentiments of the new and self-governing Malaya of the future;that is, to take example, by training young Malayans for technical and managerialposts;   by re-investing in this oountry a reasonable proportion of profits earned in years cf prosperity;   and, finally, by transferring to Malaya whenever possible the effective seat of direction of undertakings whose sole or principal seat of activityis in this country,,.,,&quot;DB 31013/1/- 1*200 2/56 R27

ANNEX CNOTES ON THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS OF. THE conference i. general as a result of the Conference, constitutional development in theFederation of Malaya over the next few years will pass through two phases.The first phase, which the Report of the Conference refers to as &quot;the interim period&quot;, is that before the Federation attains full self-government within the Commonwealth.    The second phase is that following the attaia-rnent of full self-government within the Commonwealth.    It will be convenient to deal with the conclusions and recommendations of theConference under these two heads.II. THE INTERIM PERIOD(l)    The High Commissioner^ Powers (Annex A, Appendix C, paragraph 32).(a) The Reserved Legislative PowerThis remains unchanged.(b) The Reserved Executive power the High Commissioner will in future act on the advice of theExecutive Council unless he considers it expedient in the interest of public order, public faith or good government to reject their advice..    Before actingcontrary to their advice he must obtain the prior approval of the Secretaryof State, and give the Chief Minister an opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State, unless he considers mat the interests of public order, public faith or good government are too urgent, in which case he mayact against the advice of the Executive Council without any prior approval.These arrangements do not apply to matters relating to external defence and external affairs, in which the High Commissioner will retain completediscretion.(2)    Defence and Internal Security (Annex A, paragraphs 7-24).(a) DefenceResponsibility for external defence will remain entirely with theHigh Commissioner, but in order to prepare for the assumption by theFederation Government of responsibility for external defence, there willduring the interim period be an External Defence Committee, includingMalayan Ministers, with the High Commissioner as Chairman, to discuss matters relating to the external defence of the Federation.    It will haveno executive powers and will be purely advisory to the High Commissioner.(b) Internal SecurityA Malayan Minister for Internal Defence and Security will assume responsibility for the administration of the police force and the Federationarmed forces.    So long as the Emergency continues, operational command
of the police force and the Federation armed forces will remain with theDirector of Operations.     The present Director of Operations Committeewill, however, be replaced by an Emergency Operations Council, with theMinister for Internal Defence and Security as Chairman and the Directorof Operations among its members.    A Police Service Commission will beset up to deal with appointments, promotions and discipline in the migher ranks of the police force.    It will be completely free from political influence.    For the administration of the Federation armed forces therewill be set up, under the Chairmanship of the Minister for Internal defence and Security, a Federation Armed Forces Council modelled upon the Armyand Air Councils in the United Kingdom.(3)    Financial and Economic Matters (Annex A, paragraphs 28-37).(a) Minister of finance the Financial Secretary, at present a member of Her Majesty&apos;sOversea Civil Service, will be replaced by a Malayan Minister of Finance.(b) Exchange control the Federation Government v/ill continue to regulate its dollar expenditure in general conformity with the policy followed by the sterling area and in consultation with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) Financial AssistanceThis will continue on the same lines as at present.(4)    The Public Service   (Annex A, paragraphs 38-61).(a) Public Service commission a Public Service Commission with executive authority will be set up from 1st July, 1957, to deal with appointments, promotions and discipline in the Public Service.    It will be independent and free from political influence.    Before that date the present Public Service Appointments andPromotions Board will remain advisory to the High Commissioner.(b) Compensation scheme a scheme will be introduced in two phases.    Until 1st July, 1957,members of Her Majesty&apos;s Oversea Civil Service will be permitted to retireon earned pension even if they have not served for the ten years normallyrequired for pension purposes.    After that date they will be free to retireWhen they will and entitled to lump-sum compensation in addition to theirearned pension.    It will also then be open to the Federation Government to dispense with an oversea officerfs services on payment of the due compensa-tion and pension.     The scheme contains various other elements, but thoseare its main lines.(5)    Constitutional Changes (Annex A, paragraphs 62-73).(a)   The High Commissioner^ PowersSee (l) above.
(b)   The Executive council the Financial Secretary will be replaced by a Malayan Minister ofFinance (see (3)(a) above).    The Secretary for Defence will disappear and matters of external defence will be handled by the High Commissionerhimself, matters of internal security being handled by the new Ministerfor Internal Defence and Security.     The Minister for Economic Aff airs(at present a member of Her Majesty&apos;s Oversea Civil Service) will bereplaced by a Minister for Commerce and Industry, who may be eitheran unofficial or an official.    The Chief Secretary and Attorney-general will continue to remain members of Her Majesty&apos;s Oversea Civil Serviceand to have seats in the Council.(c) The Legislative CouncilThere will be no significant change except in consequence of the changes noted in (b) above.(d) The British AdvisersThe British Advisers to the Rulers will be withdrawn within about ayear&apos;s time.     Their functions have already been overtaken by constitutional change and they no longer have an essential part to play in the administrationof the Federation.     There was therefore no good ground for opposition to the collective view of Their Highnesses the Rulers and Alliance Ministers thatthe British Advisers should be withdrawn.III.   CONSTITUTIONAL. COMMISSION (Annex B, paragraphs 10-22).(l)    CompositionThe proposed composition of the Commission is set out in annex B.     The Lord Chancellor very kindly agreed that Lord Reid shouldbe invited to be Chairman and he has accepted.    The United Kingdommember seems likely to be Sir Ivor Jennings, Master of Trinity Hall,Cambridge.     The Governments of the other Commonwealth countries concerned are being approached through our High Commissioners withrequests to suggest suitable members,(2)    Terms of reference the terms of reference are set out in Annex B.There was some difficulty with the Malayan Delegation about theposition of Her Majesty the Queen in relation to the British Settlementsof Penang and Malacca, but the Conference ultimately recorded a clear understanding that nothing in the terms of reference should be taken toprejudge the recommendations of the Commission on this matter.    Itwas also clearly understood by the Conference that (iv) of the terms ofreference will not preclude the Commission from recommending thatBritish subjects and subjects of the &quot;Rulers should retain their status as such even if they acquire the proposed common nationality for thewhole of the Federation.(3)    TimingIt was agreed that the Commission should be set up as soon aspossible and that every effort should be made to avoid delay in the intro-duction of full self-government.     The Alliance had committed themselves
so deeply over the date of August,  1957, in this connection that it simplyhad to be accepted as ftxe aim.     The Malayan Delegation explicitlyrecognised, however, that this aim was almost certainly unattainable,and that it was very unlikely that full self-government could be introduced before the spring of 1958 at the earliest.     Tunku Abdul Rahman firmlystated that he and his colleagues would - and could successfully - defendany delay beyond August, 1957.     The composition of the commission should help in avoiding any criticism on grounds of delay.IV.   FULL SELF-GOVERNMENT(l)    Defence and Internal Security(a) defence Working Party under the Chairmanship of the Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South East Asia will be set up as soonas possible to prepare a treaty of defence and mutual assistance between her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Federation Government.    It wasagreed that the Australian and New Zealand Governments should beinvited to nominate observers at its meetings.    Its terms of referenceare:-&quot;To consider and make recommendations onthe detailed provisions of a Treaty of Defence and mutual Assistance between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom and the Government of anindependent Federation of Malaya, bearing in mind the following general principles:-The Federation Government(a) will afford to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom the right to maintain in the federation the forces necessary for the fulfilment of commonwealth and international obligations:(b) will continue to afford to Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfacilities needed in the Federation for the maintenance and support of these forces, which would include theCommonwealth Strategic Reserve:Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom(c) will undertake to assist the Federation Governmentin the external defence of its territory:(d) will consult the Federation Government in regardto the exercise of their rights under the Treaty&quot;.The intention is that the Treaty should be signed when full self-government is introduced.     The agreement reached in the Conferencemeets in full the requirements which we had set ourselves beforehand.(b) Internal SecurityIt was agreed that, even after the attainment of full self-government, it would be essential that the present effective securityintelligence machine should retain its efficiency, and also that, in view
of its importance in the field of external defence as well as of internal security, its working would remain a matter of joint concern toHer Majesty&apos;s Government and to the Federation Government.     (TheConference decided not to include in its published Report its agreed conclusions and recommendations on security intelligence.     They are contained in the Report of the Defence and Internal Security Committeeof the Conference).(2)  Financial and Economic Matters(a) Financial AssistanceIt was recognised that the attainment of full self-governmentimplied the principle of financial self-sufficiency, but it was agreed thatcertain particular measures of financial assistance by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would continue to be available to the Federation Governmenteven after full self-government had been attained, and that, if theEmergency had not by then been brought to an end, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would still be prepared to consider with the Federation government whether the financial needs of the Federation would justify special assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government towards meeting the cost ofthe Emergency over and above the substantial assistance which willcontinue to be given through the forces and services provided by theUnited Kingdom to sustain the fight against the communist terrorists,(b) Overseas investment the Conference recorded the repeated assurance by the MalayanDelegation that it would remain the policy of the Federation Governmentto encourage overseas investment, industry and enterprise to look to malaya with every assurance of fair and considerate treatment and withoutfear of discrimination.     This included continuation of the present policywhereby the overseas investor could, after payment of local taxes and obligations, remit to his country, within the framework of ordinary and reasonable exchange control requirements, funds for the payment of dividends and for the repatriation of his capital.(3)   The Public service the arrangements for a Public Service Commission and a lump-sum compensation scheme set out in 11(4) above will remain in operation.(4)  The constitution the constitutional pattern proposed for a fully self-governingFederation of Malaya will emerge from the work of the constitutional commission described in III above.
