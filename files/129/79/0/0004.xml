IBPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1956SECRET Copy No.   5 0CP. (56) 45th January, 1956CABINETIMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the development of the Imperial College on the island site at SouthKensington is in the forefront of the Governments plans for the expansion of technological education in the universities. Our intentions were announced inJanuary 1953 and have been several times reaffirmed in Parliament. We are committed by these statements to give Imperial College the rest of the island site asit can be made available.2. Preparations are already in hand to move from this site such bodies as theMuseums; and the Home Affairs Committee have recently decided that the imperial institute should be moved from the site to a new building, to be provided by theGovernment (H.P. (55) 18th Meeting, Item 1).3. There remains a single issue to be decided whether the Collcutt buildings should be demolished to make way for new College buildings; or whether it shouldbe preserved and taken over by the College lor academic use. The Home AffairsCommittee were not agreed on this issue, and I, therefore, bring it before theCabinet.4. The Royal Fine Art Commission wrote to the Treasury in June 1955recommending that the Collcutt Building should be preserved and asking theGovernment to review its proposals in order to achieve this; and a similar view hasbeen expressed in other quarters also. At the Home Affairs Committee some ministers felt that the possibilities of preserving it as a part of the Imperial Collegeshould be further considered. There has however already, both before and afterthe receipt of the Fine Art Commission^ views, been exhaustive examination ofthis alternative.5. The plans submitted by the College in 1954 envisaged intensive developmentof the site to provide, in its central area, some 610,000 square feet of floor space.Retention of the Collcutt Building would mean the loss of 250,000 square feet ofthis space roughly 18 per cent, of what ought to be available when the whole sitehas been developed, and more than 40 per cent, of the central area. Because it is planned in a manner wasteful of space, occupation of the Collcutt Building would,in the view of the College authorities, offset only some 55,000 square feet of this loss.Though this may be a conservative estimate, retention of the Collcutt Buildingmeans the loss of between four and five times as much space as it can itself provide.6. The overriding consideration must surely be the effect on student numbers.The loss of floor space involved in the retention of the Collcutt Building would makeit necessary to reduce the number of students at Imperial College by 360, of whom270 would be postgraduates and 90 undergraduates. This is about one-quarter ofthe whole planned expansion; and in terms of output, it represents about 200technologists a year from postgraduate courses and 30 with first degrees intechnology.49364
7. The University Grants Committee, who are our advisers in these matters,have gone carefully into this problem, and they are convinced that a curtailment ofthe Imperial College expansion (or any delay in carrying it out) such as wouldresult from incorporating the existing Collcutt Building in the College would seriously damage the Governments plans for expanding higher technological education. The main loss would be in a form of technological education to whichthe Committee attach great importance and which they regard Imperial Collegeas particularly well qualified to undertake, namely, postgraduate courses of instruction designed to train technologists of the highest quality. Most of thenew postgraduate students we should lose would be taking such courses. In face of this advice, we ought not to interfere with the College plans except for the mostcompelling reasons.8. It was suggested at the Home Affairs Committee that we might meet our obligations to the College by providing it with an additional site elsewhere. this possibility was, however, fully examined last summer by the Home AffairsCommittee, and it was investigated by the Interdepartmental Official Committeewhich examined some tentative suggestions put forward by the Royal Fine art commission for providing College accommodation and thus enabling the CollcuttBuilding to be preserved. It was established that all known sites which might be suitable are zoned for residential purposes. They could not be diverted to otheruses under existing powers, and legislation would be necessary. A site to make upthe space lost by retaining the Collcutt Building would have to be in the immediateneighbourhood of the main site, if the College were not to lose efficiency throughdispersal.9. We have recently been criticised, in both Houses and from both sides,because of slow progress with the Imperial College development. Moreover, theChairman of Governors (Viscount Falmouth) is to ask on 25th January whether we have yet come to a decision which will enable the College to carry out its fullexpansion &quot; in accordance with the announcement made by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment on 29th January, 1953.&quot;10. I am aware that a decision not to preserve the Collcutt Building may involve difficulties with the Royal Fine Art Commission and criticism from some sections of the public (even though the public generally are not normally enamouredof Victorian work); but I am also sure that any retreat from the original ImperialCollege plan would be much more dangerous and controversial, and would raisedoubts about our determination to go forward vigorously with the development of technological education in the universities. It would also cause great further delay to the execution of the project, because substantial replanning would be necessary;and delay would be deplorable in the light of national needs.11. I recommend that we should adhere to the existing plan for thedevelopment of the College, and should decide now that the Collcutt buildings should be demolished; and that a letter should be written to the Royal Fine art commission stating that the Government have carefully and sympatheticallyreviewed the whole matter, and explaining the reasons for their conclusion.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,3rd January, 1956.
