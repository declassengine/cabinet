THXS^WOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)i: secret.P.(56) 29 COPY NO,6th February, 1956CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME:  WIDOWS1 benefits memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in C.P,(56) 23 the Minister of Pensions seeks authority tomake a statement announcing the Governments intentions in regard tothe recommendations in the Report of the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee on Widows&apos; Benefits,    This Report deals with the provisionfor widows under the National Insurance Scheme and raises the relatedquestion of the future of the 10s. widow.2, The Minister has proposed:(a) that all the recommendations made bythe Advisory Committee should beaccepted, including the suggestion thatthe payment for each child should beraised by 5s, ;(b) that the rate of the 10s. pension should beraised to 15s, and future awards of thispension should be stopped.3. These proposals would involve additional expenditure fromthe National Insurance Fund of  3^ millions for widows generally andof   2 millions for 10s, widows,    I note that some part of this increasehas been taken into account as part of the cost of the proposed family allowance Bill and that there would be a saving to the Exchequer in national assistance of about  1^ millions.4. In present circumstances, additional expenditure of this order is unwelcome.    Moreover, the proposed increase of 5s. in thechildren&apos;s rate - a matter which was not strictly within the terms ofreference of the Advisory Committee - is generous.    Nevertheless, Iwould not wish to raise objection to the Minister&apos;s proposals for widowsgenerally.. 5. I do, however, see grave objection to the proposal that therate of the 10s, widow&apos;s pension should be raised by 5s. at a cost of  2 millions,6. It is agreed that the payment of these pensions is ananachronism.    The National Insurance Scheme does not treat widowhoodas a condition which as such calls for a permanent pension - and thisdoctrine has been endorsed by the Advisory Committee in their Report.
103n pensions, payable to widows whose husbands had contributedfor the unconditional pension provided under the pre-1948 scheme,have been continued as a transitional measure.    For this reason, boththis Government and its predecessor have refused to increase thisparticular pension rate when other rates have been raised.7. A pension rate of 10s. bears no relation to subsistence;nor would a rate of 15s.    The sole justification for an increase ofthis kind would be the maintenance of the value of the pension.    Butthe acceptance of a commitment of this nature in relation to 10s,widows would destroy the Government&apos;s case for leaving the non-contributory old age pension at 26s.    A comparable concession herewould cost about  6 millions.    Similar improvements in pension rates in the industrial injury and war pension fields - which have remained unchanged since 1940 - would cost a further  150, 000.0. An increase of 5s. in the 10s. pension would, in the case ofthe majority of widows who have other resources or are earning,merely mean an extra 5s. a week spending power.     10s. widowswithout resources who now receive national assistance would not benefit by a net increase in income,   as the extra pension would be deducted from the assistance payment now in issue.9. There is a strong case for cutting off future awards ofthis pension and thus removing a potential source of future embarrass-ment.    A cut off now would mean the ultimate disappearance of theproblem of the 10s. widow.    But the existence of a &quot;closed&quot; classof 10s. - or 15s.  - widows would remain as a source of trouble formany years.10. I consider that we should seize this chance to stop futureawards of 10s. pensions, but I feel strongly that we should make no concession to existing 10/- widows.    Any concession would be costlyand would have expensive repercussions.    If my colleagues thinkthat this is not a feasible course I consider that we should stand firm on the present arrangements and the present rate.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.6th February, 1956.
