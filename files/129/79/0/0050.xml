Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1956SECRETCP. (56) 5024th February, 1956CABINETCOST OF MEAT INSPECTIONMemorandum by thk Chancellor of the ExchequerMeat inspection has been the responsibility of local authorities since before thewar and, except during the period of control ended in July, 1954 when theGovernment was the owner of the meat and Government grants were given, its costhas been met from their funds. In some areas there are central slaughterhousesserving a number of local authority districts, and the local authorities concernednow object to paying all the cost of inspecting meat when a large proportion of the meat will be eaten elsewhere.The Case for Exchequer Assistance2. This problem has been considered at a series of meetings, culminating withthe meeting on 27th January of the Home Affairs Committee (H.P. (56) 1st Meeting,Item 8). That Committee recommended, with the Treasury dissenting, thatExchequer assistance should be given to local authorities. The main reasons forthis recommendation are:  (a) The present system places an unduly heavy burden on certain localauthorities, and the financial assistance given during control should therefore be restarted. The burden may be accentuated by furtherconcentration of slaughterhouse facilities.(b) Efficient food inspection is a public health service and a proper charge on public funds. The Exchequer grant to port health authorities has beencited as a precedent.(c) It would be contrary to this policy to transfer the cost to the consumer by making a charge for meat inspection and such a scheme might bedifficult to administer because many slaughterhouses are privately owned.(d) The cost to the Exchequer would be small, not more than  100.000 to 150,000 a year.The Case Against Exchequer Assistance3. Throughout the discussions the Treasury has resisted an Exchequer grant for this purpose as an important matter of principle, the main reasons being:  (a) No case can be built for a specific grant for meat inspection on the groundthat it is a public health service. Public health services account for about  90 million a year of local authorities&apos; expenditure in England andWales alone and no specific Exchequer grant-aid is given over the wholeof this field, except for the Port Health Service, which costs only about 200,000.(b) The Port Health Services are unique, being akin to Customs.  The meatinspection service is not of this character, but arises directly from localindustry. But even if an exact precedent could be found for making agrant for meat inspection, it cannot be accepted that any precedent infavour of Exchequer expenditure must necessarily prevail against other considerations.Copy NOi 5 H49614
Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,23rd February, 1956.(c) In Scotland, on the other hand, there is a direct precedent for not awardingan Exchequer grant. The compulsory meat inspection service is alreadyrate-borne in that country without Exchequer grant even thoughScotland is a net exporter of meat.(d) There is strong pressure on the Government to introduce new exchequer grants for several other purposes, and for all of them a persuasive casecan be presented if they are considered in isolation. They include localwelfare services, services for blind and handicapped persons,maintenance of sea defences, mining subsidies, street lighting, andmaintenance and minor improvement of classified roads in metropolitanand country boroughs. But the total cost, if all these claims for exchequer money were granted, is to be reckoned in tens of millions of pounds a year. As there are alternative ways of financing meatinspection, it is difficult to regard the merits of its claim to exchequer grant as overwhelming, among all these other claims where a generalconcession is manifestly impossible because of the scale of expenditure involved.(e) The whole subject of local government finance has been reviewed by an interdepartmental committee in preparation for negotiations which mustshortly take place with the local authorities. I understand that, in considering the proposals for new Exchequer grants known to be beforeDepartments, the Committee remark that a case can always be made forhew specific grants, but that unless these are accompanied by reductions in existing specific grants their effect in the aggregate is to increase thelocal authorities&apos; dependence upon specific grants and thus to run againstthe objective of strengthening local government.(/) The Interdepartmental Committee on Slaughterhouses, after full and carefulconsideration of all the relevant facts, including the representations of allthe interested parties, have approved the principle of the cost of inspection being borne by the owners of the meat. Costs of inspectionare not really distinguishable from other costs of producing clean meat.,Such a charge could be imposed without serious practical difficulty andit would increase the price of meat to the consumer by only one-quarterof 1 per cent, of the retail price (say a halfpenny in the  ) if the meattraders passed on the charge.(g) In present economic circumstances, when we are making every effort to cutdown both central and local government expenditure, it is particularly important that any new charge on public funds should be avoided.Conclusion4. For the reasons given above I cannot accept the risk of an additional burden on the Exchequer at a time when my objective is to secure all possible economy inthe field of Government expenditure. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree thatthe Minister of Agriculture should be asked to formulate an alternative scheme,without an Exchequer grant, either leaving the cost on the rates or passing it on bya charge to the owner of the meat. Of the two, I prefer the latter.H. M.
