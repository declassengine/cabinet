; w i S 7(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(56) 3714th February, 1956RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES bill note by the Chancellor of the exchequer have observed the points made by the Lord Chancellor inparagraph 10 of C.P.(56) 34 relating to procedure under the restrictive practices Bill when enacted, and in particular to the matter ofParliamentary responsibility.2, I am in agreement with what is being done with the object ofmaking the conduct and presentation of the public interest in cases beforethe Restrictive Practices Court as independent as possible of political control or Parliamentary discussion.     But I think it might be helpful ifI were to indicate what I think the position is in relation to parliamentary proceedings and Questions.3. If the Bill is enacted as drafted, there are various kinds of possible Parliamentary proceedings which will arise:-(a) Questions relating to the appointment of the registrar., e.g. the selection of the individual,the conditions of service etc.    I imagine thatthe Prime Minister might well feel mat heshould take these.     But equally I would thinkit inappropriate that he should be asked toaccept responsibility beyond this very limitedfield.(b) Questions relating to the &quot;housekeeping&quot; of theRegistrars organisation,  e.g. numbers ofstaff, their conditions, etc.     I contemplate that the Registrar will be financed from aseparate Vote of which he will be AccountingOfficer.     It would be reasonable that questions in this category should be answered by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury.(c) General questions relating to the work of the registrar or to the functions of the Registrarin relation to Court proceedings.It seems to me that all questions relating to registration which under Clause 7 of thedraft Bill are primarily the. concern of the;Board of Trade ought to be answered by board of Trade Ministers.    Thus, it would be-1 -COPY NO,    W \CABINET
natural for them, for instanceeto answer questions A&quot;about the number and categories of agreements on the Register,It may be that the scope for questions about thefunctions of the Registrar in relation to Courtproceedings will be very limited.     But so faras such questions do appear on the Order paper,it seems to me that it would be appropriate forthe President of the Board of Trade to answerthem even though the answer may be to point tothe independent status of the Registrar and to decline responsibility.4. I am strengthened in my conviction that these propositionsare right by considering what ought to happen in the event of otherParliamentary proceedings,  e, g. a Supply day for discussion of theworking &quot;of the whole machinery, perhaps particularly the pace at whichit was functioning.     It seems to me that it would be natural and nec ess ax*for Board of Trade Ministers to speak for the Government (perhaps withthe assistance of the Law Officers) on such an occasion.    If that is so,it is an added reason why they should answer such general questions asmaybe asked other than those mentioned at 3(b) above.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.Y/.1.13th February, 1956.
