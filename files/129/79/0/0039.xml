confidential.P0(56) 39 COPY NO. i 14 th February, 1956CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND PARLIAMENT;  DISQUALIFICATION     -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs on 11th January I informed my colleagues of the possibility that several Members of the Parliament of Northern Ireland might be dis-quali.fied.    I explained that I was consulting the Attorney-General, thatan enquiry would be conducted by a Select Committee at Stormont, andthat I would report further to the Cabinet (CM. (56) 3rd Conclusions,Minute 1).2.      I now confirm that three Members of the House of Commons(including the former Speaker) and one Senator were holding offices orprofit under the Crown at the time of their election.    By Section 10(2) ofthe Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the House of Commons disqualifica-tion law for the time being in force at Westminster applies also to bothHouses of the Northern Ireland Parliament.     The four Members are accordingly disqualified.3.      The facts were elicited by Select Committees of the two Houses atStormont, and copies of their reports are attached.    Each House has passed a Resolution -(i)   declaring the Member or Members concerned tohave been incapable of being returned;   and(ii) agreeing with its Committee&apos;s recommendation that representations should be made immediately to us, inviting us to introduce legislation at westminster indemnifying these Members andvalidating their elections.The reason for this recommendation is that the Northern ireland parliament has no power to legislate on the subject of the qualifications and disqualifications of its Members,4.      I am advised that under Section 18(1) of the Act of 1920 the senate and House of Commons of Northern Ireland have power to pass Resolutionsdeclaring elections void (or seats vacant).     This they have done, and it follows that the United Kingdom Parliament is not concerned with whetherthe Members concerned are disqualified but only with the questions ofindemnification and validation.    It therefore seems neither necessary norappropriate to refer the matter to a Select Committee here.    There maywell be a demand for one, but I suggest that we should have good grounds for resisting it.
5.      The need for legislation at Westminster must of course beestablished and I suggest that tills can best be done by means of a shortWhite Paper incorporating the Northern Ireland Select Committee reportsalong with copies of the Resolutions of the two Houses.    A draft is at annex A...    It seems advisable for a statement on the lines of Annex Bto be made to Parliament when the proposed White Paper is presented,This might conveniently form part of the next Business Statement,,6.      I seek the authority of the Cabinet for -(i)  the presentation of a White Paper as at annex A;(ii) the  making of a statement to parliament as at Annex B;(iii)   the preparation of legislation to indemnify the disqualified Members and to validate their elections.G0 LL, -G.Home Office, s. W. 1.13th February, 1956,
DRAFT WHITE paper in their report of 12th July, 1955, on the cases of Mr. J.C. Georgeand Sir Roland Jennings, the House of Commons Select Committee on elections -&quot;noted the fortuitous way in which the cases they have considered have been brought to notice.     They cannotoverlook the possibility that there may be, amongstpresent Members of the House of Commons,  some who might be found to have unexpected technical disabilities.They consider that all Government Departments should at once examine their lists of public appointments inorder to determine whether there may be other members who should be warned that there may be doubt about the validity of their election.&quot;    (House of Commons (1955)No. 3 5, paragraph 110)2.     Pursuant to this recommendation, Treasury Circulars were sent to all United Kingdom Government Departments requesting them toexamine the lists of public appointments within their jurisdiction and to verify that these did not include the names of any Members of the Houseof Commons at Westminster or of the Northern Ireland Senate or Houseof Commons.    No fresh cases of disqualification in this country weredisclosed by this enquiry, but as a result of a similar check carried out-by the Government of Northern Ireland it was discovered that three members of the Northern Ireland House of Commons (including theformer Speaker) and one Senator might be disqualified.3.      The Senate was recalled, therefore, on 17th January, 1956, toenable a statement to be made by the Prime Minister.    Both the senate and the House of Commons then appointed Select Committees to considerthe.position of their Members.    The Select Committees reported on 7th February, and copies of their reports are annexed;   these were considered by the respective Houses on Oth February whereupon thefollowing Resolutions were passed;-The Senate1,That Lt0 -Colonel H.S0C. Richardson being returnedas a Member of the Senate, having at the time of his electionheld an office of profit under the Crown, was incapable ofbeing returned as a Member of this House, and that this house agrees with the recommendations contained in theReport of the Select Committee on Elections. &quot;The House of Commons&quot;That Capt. the Rt. Hon.&apos; Sir Norman Stronge, Bart. ,being returned as a Member for Mid-Armagh, theRta Hon. Sir William McCleery, being returned as aMember for North Antrim, and Dr. Eileen Hickey, being returned as a Member for Queen&apos;s University, having
JL Dat fee time of their election held certain offices of profit under the Crown, were incapable of being returned as members of this House, and that this House agrees withthe recommendations contained in the Report of the SelectCommittee on Elections. &quot;4.      The Parliament of Northern Ireland,having no power to legislateon the subject of the qualifications and disqualifications of its MemberSjthe Government of Northern Ireland have made representations to her majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom (as recommended by theSelect Committee and agreed by the Senate and House of Commons ofNorthern Ireland) that indemnifying and validating legislation should beintroduced at Westminster.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government note that none of those concerned applied for or received any remuneration or expenseswhatsoever from the offices in question, and that the respective select committees were satisfied that all the Members acted in all good faith and without any knowledge of the legal complexities involved.5,      In these circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decidedto introduce legislation at Westminster as soon as possible to indemnify the disqualified Members against the penalties recoverable from themby common informer actions, and to validate their elections.
D RAFT STATEMENT TO parliament have to inform the House that following the receipt of representations from the Government of Northern Ireland concerning the disqualification cf three Members of the Northern Ireland House of Commons(including the former Speaker) and one Senator, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent have decided to introduce legislation as soon as possible to indemnify those concerned against common informer penalties and to validate their elections.2.      Legislation at Westminster is necessary because the Parliamentof Northern Ireland has no power to legislate on the subject of the qualifications and disqualifications of its Members.3.      The facts will be laid before Parliament in the form of a white paper, which will be published very shortly.     The White Paper willincorporate the reports of Select Committees of the Northern IrelandHouse of Commons and Senate and also the texts of Resolutions passedby the two Houses declaring the disqualified Members to have beenincapable of being returned and proposing that representations should bemade to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.

REPORTYour Committee, appointed to consider whether the election of Lieut. -Colonel Henry Sacheverell Carleton Richardson as a member of the Senateis invalid on the ground that at the time of his election he held an office or place of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section 24 of the succession to the Crown Act, 1707; and to report whether such Memberappears on that account to have been incapable of election to this House,and, if so, what representations should be made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.Have considered the matters to them referred and have agreed to thefollowing Report:Your Committee have held five meetings and have examined the attorney-General, Major J. W. McConnell, Secretary, and Mr. H. Anderson,Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, and Lieut-Colonel Richardson, the Member whose election to the Senate was underconsideration. Lieut.-Colonel Richardson&apos;s evidence was taken at &quot;Rossfad,&quot;Ballinmallard, County Fermanagh, by leave of the Senate under and by virtueof a Resolution duly resolved on Wednesday, 25th January, 1956. Memo-randa were also submitted by the Attorney-General and the Ministry ofLabour and National Insurance.Your Committee have also considered the Reports of the Select Com-mittees of the House of Commons at Westminster which were set up toconsider the cases of Mr. Charles Alfred Howell and Mr. Charles Beattie.Your Committee are advised that the law on the subject of Disqualifica-tion may be summed up as follows:Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, provides that no person having an office of profit under the Crown shall be capable of being elected, or of sitting or voting as a Member of the House of Commons.In 1703 the Irish Parliament passed the House of Commons Disquali-fication Act (Ireland), 1793, Section one of which imposed a similar disquali-fication in respect of membership of the Irish House of Commons.The House of Commons (Disqualifications) Act, 1801, Section 1, providedthat all persons disabled from or incapable of being elected, sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of Great Britain should be disqualified from being elected or sitting or voting in the House of commons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Great Britain.Section 2 provided similarly that all persons disqualified from being elected,sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of ireland should be disqualified from being elected, sitting or voting in the House ofCommons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Ireland.Section 3 provided that persons disqualified by British Statutes should notbe enabled to sit and vote in the House of Commons of the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom as Members for Ireland nor should persons disqualified byActs of the Parliament of Ireland be enabled to sit or vote in the Houses ofParliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Great Britain.Section 18(2) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, applied the lawfor the time being in force relating to the qualification and disqualification
of Members of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom tothe Members of the Senate and House of Commons of Northern Ireland.Lieut-Colonel H. S. C. Richardson was appointed by the then Minister ofLabour and National Insurance in December, 1945, to be the Chairman ofa district advisory committee set up under Section 17 of the Disabled Persons(Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, and he continued in this appoint-ment until he resigned on the 16th January, 1956.Lieut.-Colonel H. S. C. Richardson was first elected to the Senate ofthe Parliament of Northern Ireland on 29th November, 1949, and was re-elected on 16th June, 1953.The Attorney-General informed your Committee that he would feelconstrained by the authority of precedents established in similar cases toadvise that if Lieut-Colonel Richardson was appointed as Chairman of theEnniskillen District Advisory Committee so that the emoluments attached tothe appointment under paragraph 4 of the Second Schedule to the disabled persons (Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, became payable, then,notwithstanding the fact that no such emoluments were ever paid to Lieut-Colonel Richardson, the appointment was in his opinion an office of profit under the Crown within Section 24 of the 1707 Act.Your Committee, having carefully considered the evidence of Lieut-Colonel Richardson and the other witnesses called, including that of the attorney-General, are satisfied that Lieut-Colonel Richardson was appointed and acted as Chairman of the Enniskillen District Advisory Committee andthat during part of this period he was also a Member of the Senate. your committee are also satisfied that this office constitutes am Office of profit under the Crown within the meaning of the relevant Statutes and their opinion is reinforced by recent decisions in similar cases at Westminster.Your Committee, in view of the advice of the Attorney-General, concludetherefore that at the time of his election to the Senate Lieut-colonel richardson held an Office of Profit under the Crown and his election wastherefore invalid.Your Committee are also satisfied that Lieut.-Colonel Richardson acted in all good faith and without any knowledge of the legal complexities involved,and that at no time did he apply for or receive any remuneration or expensesof any kind whatsoever during his Chairmanship and that when the questionof his disqualification was officially brought to his attention in a letter fromthe Prime Minister he immediately tendered his resignation as chairman and Member of the Committee and has not attended the Senate nor anycommittees thereof from that date.Your Committee therefore strongly recommend, that representationsshould be made immediately through the usual channels to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to introduce the necessary legislation to indemnify Lieut.-colonel richardson and to validate his election.
MINUTES OF EVIDENCEFIRST DAYFRIDAY, 20th JANUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met on Friday, 20th January, 1956 atStormont.There were present :-Sir George Clark, Mrs. Greeves, M.B.E., Sir WilsonHungerford, Mr. Pollock, and Dr. Quin, C.B.E., LL.D.Right Hon. J. E. Warnock, Q.C., D.L., M.P., Attorney-General, and MajorF. A. L. Harrison, Q.C., M.B.E., Counsel to the Speakers and Examiner ofPetitions for Local Bills, were in attendance.Dr. Quin: By virtue of his position ofDeputy Speaker, I propose that Sir WilsonHungerford take the Chair.Mr. Pollock: I second that.Agreed.The Chairman: Thank you very much. I appreciate the compliment. Before we reallyget down to business, I should like to saythat I know that the Members of this Com-mittee will not think that I am casting anyreflection on any of them when I say that Iam very sorry that there are no membersof the Opposition on this Committee. Weall heard yesterday the reasons why theycould not see their way to act. I have been on a good many Committees on which members of the Opposition have sat, andI have always found them very co-operativeand very helpful with their suggestions. i feel that if we had had one of them hereto-day he would have given us much help.As far as the fact-finding duty of thisCommittee is concerned, I feel that in thatat any rate we would have had their sup-port. As I say, I am very sorry they arenot here, but they have made their position clear. We heard from the Leader of the senate what the legal position is, but un-.fortunately, as we all know, the acousticsin the House are not very good, and Mem-bers on the Back Benches sometimes find it very difficult to follow the proceedings.Therefore, it is very kind of the Attorney-General to come here and help us in re-gard to this matter. Without wasting anymore time I would ask the Attorney-general to tell us in layman&apos;s language the actualposition.The Attorney-General: I shall try to doso. I have prepared a memorandum, and perhaps it might help the Members to fol-low it if I gave each of them a copy.(Copies of the memorandum were circu-lated to the Members.) The statement is asfollows:As this is the first occasion upon whicha Committee of the Senate has been calledupon to consider any question of disquali-fication, perhaps I may be allowed to makea general statement.An Act of Parliament passed 250 yearsago, and known as The Succession to theCrown Act, 1707, provided, inter alia, thatany person who holds an office of profit under the Crown is incapable of being elected or of sitting or voting as a Memberof the House of Commons, and Section18(2) of the Government of Ireland Act,1920, provides that the law for the timebeing in force relating to the qualificationand disqualification of the Membersof the Commons House of Parlia-ment of the United Kingdom shall,save as otherwise provided by this Act,apply to the Members of the Senate and house of Commons of Northern Ireland.The Committee will notice that the 1707Act only referred to the House of Com-mons. There are other Statutes dealing withthe subject, one of 1793 of the old IrishParliament, and an Act of the new UnitedKingdom Parliament passed after the Union,but I do not think it is necessary to troublethe Committee with these Statutes. As i see it, the Act of 1707 must be our guide.It is the effect of the statutory enact-ments, I think, that any person who holdsan office of profit under the Crown is dis-qualified from membership of the Senateof Northern Ireland. Your principal task isto consider whether Colonel Richardsonheld such an office.When questions of this nature have arisen at Westminster in recent years it hasbeen the practice, though not the invariablepractice, to appoint a Select Committee toconsider and report. These problems do notordinarily come before the Courts of Lawand the precedents to which we must look for guidance are to be found in the records of the proceedings of these Select Com-mittees, their recommendations, and the subsequent actions of Parliament itself.I would advise this Select Committee to regard such precedents as authoritative, andin reaching conclusions, to be guided bythem.It has been customary for the LawOfficers to attend their proceedings, and 1oendeavour to assist, and almost without ex-ception the Law Officers have stressed thedifficulties and complexities of the subject.I fully share this view. It is not easy to interpret a Statute 250 years old in thelight of the changed conditions.
In 1945 the Parliament of Northern Ire-land passed the Disabled Persons (Employ-ment) Act to make further and better provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure employment, orwork on their own account, and by Section17 the Ministry of Labour was required toestablish a Central Advisory Councilcharged with the duty of advising and assist-ing the Ministry in matters relating to theemployment or training of disabled personsgenerally, and such district advisory com-mittees as the Ministry may determine toadvise and assist it in relation to such persons in particular districts. colonel richardson was duly appointed Chairmanof the Advisory Committee for the Ennis-killen District in the year 1945.By the Second Schedule to the Act it was provided that there should be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament to themembers of the Advisory Committees suchtravelling and other allowances, includingcompensation for loss of remunerative time,as the Ministry with the approval of theMinistry of Finance might determine. Thewords &quot;such travelling and other allowances,including compensation for loss of re-remunerative time&quot; are the important words.I have seen, and I understand you will be furnished with a copy of the memorandumissued by the Ministry of Labour for theinformation of members of Tribunals and members of Committees under the disabled persons (Employment) Act. The memor-andum states that service on such bodiesis regarded as voluntary and unpaid, andthat compensation for loss of earnings isintended only to reimburse to membersamounts actually and necessarily lost. Youwill have the entire memorandum before you.I am informed by the Ministry ofLabour, and you will have evidence of this,that Colonel Richardson has never at anytime claimed or been paid any remunera-tion, allowances or expenses in respect ofhis appointment.I think that on the authority of the cases to which I will refer later the Committeeshould conclude that Colonel Richardsonheld an office and that he held it underthe Crown. But in the circumstances you may be perplexed to know how it couldbe described as an office of profit. I do notthink that the actual receipt of remunerationis necessary to constitute an office one of profit and I think this is established bysome recent cases which have been consi-dered by Select Committees at Westminster.I would like to draw your attention towhat I think are the two most recent andmost relevant cases.On 1st December, 1954, Mr. Howell, notat that time a Member of Parliament, wasappointed to two panels from which are drawn the employees&apos; representatives to sit on Local Tribunals under the National In-surance and National Insurance (industrial injuries) Acts. He was not appointed to the tribunals; he was appointed to the panelsfrom which the persons are selected.He continued to hold these appointmentsuntil August, 1955, by which time he had -been elected a Member of the House ofCommons. Mr. Howell never received any payment. Indeed he never sat on a Tribunal,though he was summoned once and theletter appointing him to the panel expresslystated that no fees were payable, but thatexpenses on a certain scale were allowed.It is provided, however, in the Statutesthemselves that members of Tribunals maybe paid such remuneration and such travel-ling and other allowances as the minister may with the consent of the Treasury de-termine. The Select Committee came to theconclusion, after hearing evidence from the attorney-General, that since under the statutes remuneration could have been paidif the Minister and the Treasury so deter-mined, Mr. Howell&apos;s appointments wereoffices of profit.The case of Mr. Charles Beattie wasconsidered by a Select Committee inDecember last. Mr. Beattie held similarappointments under the two Northern Ire-land Acts National Insurance and national insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, and theCommittee was of opinion, following thedecision in HowelTs case, that these wereoffices of profit under the Crown. Mr.Beattie also held an appointment under theNational Assistance Act and in the case ofthis appointment he was entitled to allow-ances including compensation for loss of renumerative time. The Committee will note that these words are similar to those in theStatute under whose authority colonel richardson was appointed. The report on mr. Beattie&apos;s case states that after con-sideration the Attorney-General expressedthe opinion that so far as Mr. Beattie was concerned those words constituted an officeof profit.Sir   Donald   Somervell,   when   he  wasAttorney-General in   1941, stated a prin-ciple which appears to have been accepted:The principle that has been adopted isthat if emoluments have ever been at-attached to the office the fact that emolu-ments are not received by the particularholder is irrelevant,and   in   Mr.   Beattie&apos;s   case   the   presentAttorney-General said that where an ap-pointment of any kind was governed by a statute it was the terms of the Statute andnot the terms of any letter of appointmentthereunder that had  to  be construed in deciding whether the appointment was an office of profit or not.If the facts are as I have stated, I would feel constrained by the authority of theseprecedents to advise the Committee that colonel Richardson held an office of profit under the Crown. I would wish to addthis, however. You have not heard the evi-dence of Colonel Richardson or any oneelse. If the evidence received does notbear out, or if it varies or contradicts, thefacts as given to me, I would, of course,wish to consider the effect of such evidence
to see whether it would lead me to alter myadvice.  .I shall be available at any time if theMembers of the Committee think I can help them in any way. If any Member ofthe Committee wishes to ask me any ques-tions, either now or after having had more time to consider this memorandum, I amat his or her service.The Chairman: I am sure every Mem-ber of the Committee is most grateful tothe Attorney-General for his thoughfulnessin giving each of us a copy of his memo-randum, and for setting the facts out soclearly. After what he has told us, I do notthink there should be much difficulty inany of the Member&apos;s minds, but, taking advantage of his very kind offer to clear up anything that should be doubtful, Iwould invite Members of the Committeeto ask the Attorney-General any questionsthey may have.Mr. Pollock: There is just one point.The Attorney-General mentioned an act of the United Kingdom Parliament passedafter the Union. I take it that in these casescited at Westminster that Act has not beentaken into consideration.The Attorney-General: Not at West-minster. The Committees at Westminsterappeared to have regarded, and I thinkrightly regarded, the 1707 Act as applicableto membership of that House. There wasa Select Committee set up in 1941 onOffices or Places of Profit under the Crown,and Sir Donald Somervell at that timedrew attention to the way in which thematter had been tied up. In 1707 that Actapplied only to the British Parliament, be-cause it was before the Union. When Unionbecame effective and there was one Parlia-ment for the whole of the United Kingdom,the purpose of the 1801 Act was to tie upthe legislation, and the British House ofCommons now regard the 1707 Act as theirguide.Mr. Pollock: Thank you very much.The Attorney-General: If you wish, Mr.Pollock, I shall get you the relevant docu-ment. I have it here somewhere.Mr. Pollock: I think it is quite clear. Ijust wanted an assurance that the 1801 Acthas not been taken into consideration at westminster in the cases which have been mentioned.The Attorney-General: It has never been referred to. I have no doubt that it was present in the mind of the Attorney-General of the day when he was giving his evidence, because it had to be tied up. Youwill notice, if I may make an indirectreference to it, on the first page of my memorandum I am not going to troublethe Committee with this- I said:It is the effect of the statutory enact-ments that any person ...It was. to that that my mind was directedwhen I dictated the memorandum. It is available in this Report of the Select Com-mittee which I have. Sir Donald Somervelldrew attention to it. I shall find it for you in one moment.Mr. Pollock: I am quite satisfied unlessthe Chairman would like to see it.The Attorney-General: May I say that sir Donald Somervell&apos;s minute on thismatter is to be found in this Report.Dr. Quin: On this question of the quali-fication of a Member of Parliament to sitand vote, is the law here identical with thatin Great Britain?The Attorney-General: I think it is.Assuming that the 1707 Act governs thewhole question of qualification and dis-qualification of Members at Westminster,then I think Section 18 (2) of the Govern-ment of Ireland Act provides that the samequalifications and disqualifications apply tothe Senate and Commons of NorthernIreland.Dr. Quin: My reason for asking is that not so many years ago, because he was aclerk in holy orders, the Member of Parlia-ment at Westminster for West Belfast wasdisqualified. He happened also to be aMember of the House of Commons herebut was not disqualified.The Attorney-General: I am not goingto trust my memory, but am I not right in thinking that the reverend gentleman con-cerned resigned his membership of this house?The Secretary (Major Thomson): That isquite right.The Attorney-General: That absolved us from the difficulty of coming to a decision.The Secretary: That is quite correct.Dr. Quin: I do not think that that tookplace until some time after he had beendisqualified at Westminster.The Attorney-General: I would venturethe opinion that if the reverend gentlemanhad not resigned his membership of theHouse then the House would have had to inquire into his eligibility. Having regard tothe decision of the Privy Council in that case it was referred to the Privy Council I do not think there could be any doubt asto what the result would have been.The Chairman: I was just consulting theSecretary and I do not think that therewas a great lapse of time between the dis-qualification at Westminster and that member&apos;s resignation from the House ofCommons here. As in Parliamentary pro-cedure, that point might require notice to answer.Dr. Quin: I raised the question as itoccurred to me that there might have been some difference which could have affectedour consideration of the present matter.The Attorney-General: The view I haveis that we are bound by authority. TheUnited Kingdom Parliament is the supreme
authority. If the United Kingdom Parlia-ment comes to a decision I think it wouldbe a very strong step for a Committee ofthis House, which is a subordinate Parlia-ment, to ignore or to depart from such adecision. If any subsequent action has tobe taken, assuming Colonel Richardson isfound by this Committee to be disqualified-oh which I express no opinion further than my memorandum any further steps would have to be taken by the supremeParliament which has already decided, andwould stultify itself if it did not follow itsown conclusion.Dr. Quin: I was thinking that it mightbe an unnecessary procedure to bringColonel Richardson before the Committee,firstly, to find out if he was a member ofthe advisory committee, membership ofwhich would invalidate his election to the senate, and, secondly, as you have alreadyadvised, if this particular Act under whichhe was appointed is one conferring an officeof profit under the Crown. That is all wehave to decide.The Attorney-General: As a lawyer Ithink it is a little difficult ever to come toa decision which imposes almost penal con-sequences on a man without hearing hisown defence. I understand that he is unwell;so I have been told. My own opinion isthat if he is available the Committee should certainly hear him.Dr. Quin: The main point is that eitherhe is or is not a member of the AdvisoryCommittee. If he has been appointed I donot see how our troubling him could do anything for him or for anyone else.The Chairman: My advice to the Com-mittee would be that we cannot act onhearsay.Dr. Quin: That is not hearsay.The Attorney-General: I would go so faras to advise the Committee that if colonel richardson can be available within any reasonable period of time the Committeeshould not seriously consider coming to a conclusion without hearing him.The Chairman: It would be a serious consideration to arrive at a decision without having heard Colonel Richardson.The Secretary: I have contacted colonel richardson and he is to let me know onMonday morning when he will be avail-able to attend the Committee. I think he is anxious to attend.The Attorney-General: If he were notavailable might I suggest I do not knowif there are any Standing Orders dealingwith this if his illness were such that hewas not able to attend, that he might sub-mit evidence on affidavit if the Committeewere prepared to accept that? But I wouldnot like to see the Committee decide onthis issue behind his back, so to speak. Ido not. know what defence he may have.Dr. Quin: I was trying to save colonel richardson the unpleasantness of having tocome before the Committee. That is whatwas in my mind.The Chairman: As the Secretary hasbeen in touch with Colonel Richardson, Ithink we had better wait until word has beenreceived as to his availability or otherwise.Are there any other questions which Mem-bers wish to put to the Attorney-General?Then may I again thank you very much for your kindness in coming along and also for having put yourself at our service.The Attorney-General: It is a matter for major Thomson to arrange, but I shall been gaged next week prosecuting in the Stranixmurder case. However, if I get a day&apos;notice I can make arrangements to attend the Committee at any time other thanMonday when I shall be opening the murder case. If the Committee could ex-cuse me on that day I shall be very glad.The Chairman: At any rate I think theCommittee would try to suit your convenience-ence.The Attorney-General: Might I suggestthat my memorandum should not go be-yond the Members of the Committee.The Chairman: All the Members of theCommittee will appreciate that the evi-dence, of which they have received a copy,will be strictly private.The Attorney-General withdrew.The Secretary: There is one point uponwhich I should like to hear the Speakers&apos;Counsel, and it is this question of receivingevidence, if necessary, on affidavit. Howare we situated as a Committee of theHouse to accept such evidence?Mr. Harrison: First of all, may Iapologise for appearing to be late?The Secretary: I am afraid we wererushing.Mr. Harrison: I know I was not actuallylate. I was getting the Statutes so that theywould be available should you have re-quired to see them. I also got word of this possible application on behalf of colonel richardson as to whether or not there ispower to receive evidence on affidavit. Ithink you have such power. This is not acourt of law, it is a Committee of Parlia-ment, and if it is within your terms of re-ference you would have power to receive anaffidavit. It looks as if the terms of referenceare sufficiently wide, but the question might arise as to whether you should, in fact,receive such evidence on affidavit. Lookingae all the recent cases Mr. Beattie&apos;s, Mr.Howell&apos;s and the gentleman who was a director of the Bank of New Zealand theSelect Committee have heard the persons concerned. In every recent case that I can find the Select Committee, having heard theperson concerned, found themselves able to
say that at the time he put himself up for adoption, at the time of election and atthe time he acted or voted he was acting in good faith. 1 do not think this committee could readily say that if they merely re-ceived evidence by way of affidavit. After-wards somebody might ask how could a select Committee say that a man acted in good faith on affidavit evidence. Ithink the Committee would have to judgehis demeanour. 1 am not forcing the viewthat in this case the Committee would haveto see him and test his evidence before theygave any finding on good faith in the matter.The Secretary: I wanted the Committeeto be clear on that point..The Chairman: In view of counsel&apos;opinion, supposing Colonel Richardsonfound himself well enough to receive theCommittee in his own house, could theCommittee make the long journey andhear him? Would the Committee in such circumstances be entitled to go and take evidence in his home?The Secretary: That could only be doneby permission of the House. The Senatewould have to give the Committee powerand leave to sit outside the precincts of theHouse. 1 do not suppose there would beany difficulty about that matter. The Com-mittee could then, I presume, appoint three members that is the quorum in this case to go and see Colonel Richardson. I do not know whether Mr. Harrison agrees withthat. As long as there was a quorum andthe Committee had the authority of theHouse to go and hear Colonel Richardsonit would be all right. The sub-committeeappointed would then make its report tothe full Committee.The Chairman: I raised that matter inview of CounsePs advice regarding anaffidavit.The Secretary: If on Monday we find that Colonel Richardson is not able to travel for, say, a fortnight it would thenbe better to ask the House when it sits onWednesday for permission. The Chairmancould explain the circumstances to theHouse and ask permission for the Com-mittee or a quorum to sit at colonel richardson&apos;s home and take evidence. ThisCommittee will have to make its report before Parliament is prorogued.The Chairman: Have you any other suggestions?The Secretary: I have a memorandum from the Ministry of Labour. I have not sufficient copies to give each member ofthe Committee one but I will have copiesmade. It might be convenient for theCommittee to meet on Tuesday morning to hear evidence from the Ministry of Labour.The Permanent Secretary or the Assistant.Secretary will appear before the Comittee.The Committee adjourned until 11-30 on tuesday morning.
Minutes of EvidenceSECOND DAYTUESDAY, 24th JANUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Tuesday, 24th January, 1956.There were present: Sir Wilson Hungerford (in the Chair), Sir GeorgeClark, Mrs. Greeves, Mr. Pollock and Dr. Quin.Mr. Francis Alexander Lyle Harrison, Q.C., M.B.E., Counsel to the Speakersand Examiner of Petitions for Local Bills, and Mr. H. Anderson, assistant secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, were in attendance.The Secretary (Major Thomson): colonel richardson contacted me on the telephoneyesterday and said that under doctor&apos;s ordershe would not be permitted to travel toBelfast, but that he would be quite pre-pared to receive the Committee and givewhatever evidence was in his power. Inview of that I put on the Senate order paper, which some of you may have seenthis morning, &quot;Report from Chairman ofSelect Committee&quot; in order to allow theCommittee to send a quorum because a quorum is all that is required to Ballina-mallard.It would be necessary for the Chairmanto report this matter to the Senate tp-morrow and to ask the Senate to give theCommittee permission to meet outside theprecincts of the House; in other words, togo to Ballinamallard and to take colonel richardson&apos;s evidence. That is the proper course to pursue and if the Committeeagree they should appoint three member as a quorum of the Committee to go and see Colonel Richardson either Thursday orFriday, he says, will suit him quite well to take this evidence and to report to theCommittee when they come back. It is amatter for the Committee, of course, to do what they think fit, but in everybody&apos;s in-terest Colonel Richardson should person-ally give evidence in this case. I think the speakers&apos; Counsel would agree with that.Mr. Harrison: I do, and I am merelyexpressing what the Select Committee hadin mind when they met on 20th lanuarywhen I advised them that I thought it mightbe better that such evidence be taken, butit is a matter entirely for the Select Com-mittee itself.The Chairman: I think the Committee&apos;sown views were that we must have direct evidence from Colonel Richardson and itwas a point I raised at the last meeting.Having heard the Secretary&apos;s report aboutthe situation I do not think that we have any option in the matter but to take colonel richardson&apos;s evidence in his own house. Asthe Secretary has said, it will not be neces-sary to send the whole Committee to Bal-linamallard, and the question would be todecide who would find it most convenient to come. I think that Mr. Pollock would be one of the people. I certainly will go.Dr. Quin: Might I be excused? Certainlyon Thursday I am tied up.Mrs. Greeves and Mr. Pollock consented to form the quorum with the Chairman.The Secretary: I will have a resolutionready for you to move in the Senate to-morrow, Mr. Chairman, and that will put the whole thing in order.Dr. Quin: I take it that there will thenbe a meeting of the Committee for thequorum going to Colonel Richardson&apos;s toreport back?The Chairman: Oh, certainly.The Secretary: There is one thing thatwe have to be careful about and that is thata Select Committee of another House willbe sitting and we will require Speakers&apos;Counsel at those meetings and obviously he cannot be in two places at the one time.It was decided that the Committee sitagain on Monday, 30th January, at 11-30a.m.The Chairman: We have with us thismorning Mr. Anderson, of the Ministry ofLabour, who have prepared a memorandum for us.The Secretary: All the Members have hada copy of it.The Chairman: Mr. Anderson will tell us the position regarding the appointment ofColonel Richardson, and the Section underwhich he was appointed. Will you pleasebe good enough to tell us what you knowabout this matter, Mr. Anderson?Dr. Quin: Before we go into that could we have, for the purpose of the record,the date when Colonel Richardson was firstelected a Member of the Senate?The Secretary: Colonel Richardson was first elected a Member of the Senate on the15th November, 1949, and he took the oath in the Senate on the 29th November,1949. He came into the Senate in place ofMr. Nelson, who resigned from the Senatein order to become a Member of the Houseof Commons. He was last elected to the senate on the 16th June, 1953.
Mr. Pollock: I have a small point which- I want clarified. In the memorandum by thelearned Attorney-General, on the secondpage, at the end of the second paragraph,it is stated that Colonel Richardson wasduly appointed a member of this central advisory Council in 1945.The Secretary: That should be the Ennis-killen Disablement Advisory Committee.Mr. Pollock: The Ministry of Labourmemorandum states that he was appointed chairman of the Enniskillen DisablementAdvisory Committee.The Secretary: That has been correctedin tne original.Mr. Poitock: I wanted to get clear what his actual position was.The Chairman: He is Chairman of theDistrict Advisory Committee, not tne Cen-trai Advisory Council, I now, Mr. Anaerson.Mr. Anderson: The law under which theMinistry appointed Coionei Kicnaroson is contained in Section 17 of tne Disaoieopersons (Employment) Act (Northren ire-land), 194D. inat provides that tne Ministrymay establish advisory committees tor sucndistricts in Northern Ireland as tne Minis-try may determine. The purpose of tnecommittees is to advise and assist tne Minis-try in matters relating to the employment,or undertaking of work on their own ac-count, of disabled persons in that district,and tney have the duty of making recom-mendations and reports to the Ministry on matters referred to them under the Act. TheSecond Schedule to the Act authorises theMinistry to pay out of moneys provided byParliament to the members of the district committees, such travelling and other allowances, including compensation for lossof remunerative time, as the Ministry, withthe approval of the Ministry of Finance,may determine. Under the Act the firstcommittee for the Enniskillen District was set up at the end of 1945, and colonel richardson was invited by the Minister toact as Chairman. He accepted the inyita-tion, and held the appointment until the16th January, 1956, when he resigned from it by letter. That resignation was acceptedby the Ministry in a letter dated the 18thJanuary, 1956. Colonel Richardson has notacted to a very great extent because the callson the County Fermanagh Committee werenot very great, and part of the committee&apos;s functions are discharged by panels of thecommittee appointed to deal with specificcases. Colonel Richardson was not on anyof those panels, so that his functions were really confined to the activities of the main committee. He sat on comparatively fewoccasions, and I think that the last occasionwas in March, 1952. During the entireperiod of his office he never made any claim for expenses or allowances on that com-mittee, and received no payment of any kind from the Ministry. That is, briefly, thehistory of the appointment.The Chairman: You have not a copy ofthe Minister^ letter asking Colonel Richard-son to become a member?Mr. Anderson: No, it is no longer extant.Apart from the fact that he actually hasfunctioned, there is evidence of his appoint-ment in a minute sent to the exchangemanager at Enniskillen on the 14th Decem-ber, 1945, stating:No response has yet been received tothe Ministers invitation to colonel richardson to act as Chairman of theEnniskillen Disablement Advisory Com-mittee. What was the tenor of yourrecent conversation with him on the sub-ject?The manager replied to the Ministry on the15th December :Colonel Richardson informed me thathe had written advising the Minister thathe was prepared to act but that owing toaffairs elsewhere he would necessarily beabsent from home for prolonged periodsduring the next 12 months at least.The Chairman: There is no copy of theletter in which the Minister asked him and no copy of Colonel Richardson&apos;s ac-ceptance?Mr. Anderson: No.Dr. Quin: Why?Mr. Anderson: I am afraid I cannot tellyou at this date.Dr. Quin: But surely there is some reasonfor it? This Committee was set up in 1945.Was it a committee for life or for a term ofyears and, if the latter, when was the termrenewed?Mr. Anderson: There was no limit onthe tenure?Dr. Quin: Have we the terms of office?Is there a copy of the terms of office inother words, a reference?The Chairman: A good many of theother Governmental committees are onlyelected for a certain period of years, but take it that this committee is elected andjust goes on?Mr. Anderson: Quite.Dr. Quin: It is a life appointment, is thatright?Mr. Anderson: Yes, in effect.Dr. Quin: Could we have the terms ofreference or any rules, for the guidance ofthis Committee?The Chairman: I am afraid there is onlya memorandum for the information of themembers. Perhaps Mr. Anderson will beable to tell us whether the Act says any-thing about the appointment?Mr. Anderson: No, it does not. I willread Section 17 :The  Ministry shall establish for thepurposes of this Act (a)--that does not refer to this-(b) for each such district in NorthernIreland as the Ministry may determine, a
district advisory committee, which shallbe charged with the duty of advising andassisting the Ministry in matters relatingto the employment, or undertaking ofwork on their own account, of disabled persons in that district, and in particular of making recommendations and reports to the Ministry on matters referred to thecommittee under this Act.Then sub-section (2) provides :The provisions of the Second Scheduleto this Act shall have effect with respectto the said council and committees ;The Schedule provides, among other things,thatThere shall be paid by the Ministry outof moneys provided by Parliament to themembers of the said council, of each ofthe said committees and of any panelestablished as aforesaid, and to any per-son requested by the said council or anyof the said committees or such a panelto attend before them and so attending,such travelling and other allowances, in-cluding compensation for loss of remun-erative time, and such other expenses ofthe said council, of any of the said com-mittees or of any panel established asaforesaid, as the Ministry with the ap-proval of the Ministry of Finance may determine.Dr. Quin: I take it that this was not acommittee of one? There would be one ortwo other members on the committee? Havewe, in the case of any other member, the copy of the invitation to act?The Chairman: Perhaps this would getat what Dr. Quin wants. Did the Ministermake any Regulations, firstly, regarding theterms of appointment, and, secondly, thetenure of office?Mr. Anderson: That I cannot just tell youoffhand. I will have to look that up, andalso that to which Dr. Quin has referred. Ifwe can get a copy of a letter sent to another member of the committee it might have a bearing.The Chairman: It would be very impor-tant for this Committee to know what werethe terms of appointment and if it were for a tenure of office.Mr. Anderson: I will certainly get thatfor the Committee.Dr. Quin: We do not seem to have any necessary evidence of the appointment ofColonel Richardson as a member of thiscommittee, as it stands.The Chairman: How long do you thinkit would take you to find out that, Mr.Anderson? Could we adjourn for a few minutes to let you ring up the office tosee if this Regulation is available? I thinkit is very important that the Committeeshould have it.Dr. Quin: At the same time, were minuteskept of the meetings?Mr. Anderson: Yes, I believe so. I donot know whether they are extant or not.nDr. Quin: Is the minute book available?Very often the minutes of the first meeting -do. set out the terms of reference and soon.Mr. Anderson: There will be no minutebooks. There are minutes on the filessomewhere.The Chairman: Is there an arrangement made with your officer at Enniskillen tosubmit them to you?Mr. Anderson: I will just make inquiries.The Chairman: If you could find outabout those two points particularly, wewould be grateful. I am sorry to give you the trouble.The Committee adjourned accordingly.On resuming.The Chairman: Well, Mr. Anderson, haveyou been able to rind anything for us?Mr. Anderson: The position is that paragraph (5) of the Second Schedule ofthe Act says:(1) The Ministry may by regulationsmake any such provision as appears toit to be expedient with respect to theprocedure of the said council, of anyof the said committees or of any panelestablished as aforesaid.I can confirm that no such regulations weremade by the Ministry limiting the tenure of office of anybody appointed to the com-mittees.Dr. Quin: Is the official who dealt withthis matter on behalf of the Ministry avail-able to give evidence? Or did you dealwith it?Mr. Anderson: No, I did not.Dr.   Quin:   Then  you  are  not  reallygiving evidence?Mr. Anderson:  Except in so far as isshown by the Ministry&apos;s records.Dr. Quin: Should we not be entitled tofirst-hand evidence? This is a very serious matter and should not be glossed over as though we have to accept whatever theMinistry says.The Chairman: I do not think Mr.Anderson is attempting to gloss over any-thing.Dr. Quin: No ; I am not casting anyreflection on Mr. Anderson, please under-stand that. But there is a very serious case against a Member of the Senate and if anyview is to be established by this Com-mittee we must be absolutely certain of our ground. If we are simply to have hearsayand remarks as contained, for example, inthis letter which are by no means con-clusive, then I do not think we can com-plete our work. I do not think we areentitled as a Committee to accept evidenceor statements of that nature as direct evi-dence.The Chairman: Would you like to havecounsel&apos;s opinion?Dr. Quin: Perhaps if he is able to advise on it Mr. Harrison would do so.
Mr. Harrison: Do you wish to have my view?The Chairman: Yes, if you please.Mr. Harrison: The question at issue is whether or not Colonel Richardson wasdisqualified. That is a matter that can onlybe determined by you, I respectfully sug-gest, on the best evidence which may beavailable relating to it. If, in fact, there isfirst-hand evidence of a documentary orverbal nature I think the Committee might feel that it must hear such evidence. I in-tend no reflection of any kind on thestatement of Mr. Anderson, who is putting forward the Departmental views as besthe can in a very clear way.Dr. Quin: This is a serious matter, and i feel very strongly that we have no right tocome to conclusions in a haphazard way.We must be very definite in whatever con-clusions we come to and the reasons for those conclusions.The Chairman: Would I take it that asthe Minister did not make any regulationsthe secretary acted on the wording of theAct?Mr. A nderson: Yes. Of course, the powerto make regulations is purely permissive.The Ministry may make regulations.The Chairman: Yes. They did not fixany terms of appointment or tenure of office.Dr. Quin: Were any regulations made ofany kind in relation to the procedure orfunctions of committees?Mr. Pollock: Are we to understand thata number of individuals are grouped intothings called committees without any termsof reference or without being told what todo? It seems a most extraordinary way toappoint a committee, especially when it isa review committee, without stating on what basis it is to work. There must beinstructions issued somewhere.Mr. Anderson: An officer of the ministry is the secretary to the committee and heputs before them such matters as have arisen seeking their advice or considerai-tion.Dr. Quin: That is dealing with the routine affairs of the committee only.Mr. Anderson: Quite.Dr. Quin: We are not concerned withroutine affairs of the committee; we areconcerned with the constitution of the com-mittee and the terms of reference. Theremust be some terms of reference.The Chairman: There would be a copyof the minutes of the advisory committeethat was set up in Enniskillen, would therenot?Mr. Anderson: The first meeting of thecommittee was held on 14th May, 1946,and there is a copy of the minutes here.The Chairman: You are going to read the minutes of the first meeting?Dr. Quin: Were these minutes confirmedsubsequently? Is this the Ministerial record,or is it the minute of the meeting.Mr. Anderson: This is a minute submittedby the manager at Enniskillen, who wasboth manager at the exchange and secre-tary to the committee.Dr. Quin: And were those minutes con-firmed?Mr. Anderson: I could not tell you that without a search.Dr. Quin: But surely the minutes musthave been signed by the chairman?The Chairman: You cannot tell us when there was a second meeting? You have norecord of that, have you?Mr. Anderson: I think we could find that.The Chairman: What is that? Is it amemorandum from the manager of the ex-change?Mr. Anderson: Yes, and signed by him.The Chairman: Giving a report of theproceedings?Mr. Anderson:  Yes.The Chairman: But it is not the actualminutes of the meeting?Mr. Anderson: I doubt if there were any other.The Chairman: If there were a meetingthen there must surely be something tothe members of the Committee telling them what they were to do and subsequentlyconfirming the election of the chairman?Dr. Quin: Who was present at thismeeting?Mr. Anderson: There were colonel richardson, chairman; Major Devine,Messrs. Connor. Shepherd, Cummings,Bowes, Murphy, McClay, and Mrs.Hermon.The Chairman: Will you just let us know what the manager said took place at that meeting?Mr. Anderson: I shall read it to you. ifI may. It is headed:Meeting of Disablement AdvisoryCommittee at Townhall, Enniskillen,14/5/46, at 11 a.m.Members present: Chairman: ColonelH. S. Richardson, O.B.E., Major Devine,Messrs. N. J. Connor, T. McClay, R. S.Shepherd, E. Cummings, W. Bowes, I.Murphy, and Mrs. R. O. Hermon, I.P.The Chairman read a letter from theMinister of Labour expressing regret athis inability to be present at the meetingbut stating that he looked forward to meeting the Committee in the future.Memos. No. 1 and 2 were considered bythe Committee in detail and all pointsdiscussed.The Chairman: You say two things were put forward and discussed?Mr. Anderson: Yes.
The Chairman: Have you a copy showing what those memos. were?Mr.  Anderson:   No,  I do  not  knowwhether I could find them or not.The Chairman: We do not know if theydealt with appointments and tenure?Mr. Anderson: My own opinion, for what it is worth, is that they were probably asking the Committee to consider  some specific points. This memorandum then continues:It was proposed and agreed that Mrs.R. O. Hermon, I.P., and Captain Porterbe appointed as vice-Chairman and deputy chairman respectively. It was proposed and seconded that two panels be set up.For Omagh area Captain Porter was proposed as Chairman, Mr. Shepherd asemployers&apos; representative, Mr. Cummingsto represent workers. Inquiry will bemade by these members to obtain arepresentative for other interests. ForEnniskillen Mrs. Hermon was proposed as Chairman, Mr. Couper of the S.C.W.S.as employers, Mr. McClintoc, 8 CastleStreet, Enniskillen, for employees, andMr. A. D. Connolly, 20 Townhall Street,Enniskillen, to represent other interests.The secretary was requested to contactthese persons.The disablement position in the districtwas then discussed and statistics for thearea considered, but owing to the timedevoted to preceding matters discussion on this point was necessarily brief.And that document is signed by T. M.Lyness,  manager  at  Enniskillen,  who  issecretary to  the committee.   That is theonly record.The Chairman:  Is that the only record of any meeting?Mr. Anderson: No. There are subsequentminutes which I think we could procure.The Chairman: It is the actual minuteswe&apos; would like to see rather than just a record. But before we proceed, will youlet us have a copy of that report?Mr. Anderson: Yes, I shall have it typed.Dr. Quin: And of the subsequent recordsto see if this record had the approval ofthe Chairman of the meeting?The Chairman: And if it is possible,copies of the memos. 1 and 2 referred to.Mr. Anderson: What you would reallylike, if we can produce them, is the minutesof each meeting.The Chairman: If the manager has abook or a record of the minutes we wouldlike everything dealing with this matter.Dr. Quin: I should like inquiry to bemade. It amazes me that a committee is appointed without any time limitation. Thatis completely contrary to even the practiceof the Ministry of Labour and national insurance. I find that in these other panelsdealing with national insurance and so forththere are definite appointments for a period and then there is an invitation to those whohave been acting to continue.Mr. Anderson: That is quite usual and,of course, a good many of the appointmentsyou are talking about are made under regulations where the regulation specificallyprovides for a limited period of office.The Chairman: Would you look throughyour regulations to see if there is anythingdealing with this?Mr. Anderson: I can assure you that theMinistry has power under the Act tomake regulations and so forth, but did not make regulations leaving the tenure of office as unspecified and the procedure ofthe Committee as it may determine itself.The Chairman: Would you have the lastdate on which Colonel Richardson pre-sided at a meeting?Mr. Anderson: Yes, I have. It was the13th March, 1952.The Chairman: And he never sat after that?Mr. Anderson: No.The Chairman: Was he a member of thesub-committee before he was appointed chairman?Dr. Quin: The district committee?Mr. Anderson: No, he was appointed chairman at the time the committee was set up. It did not exist before that.Dr. Quin: Was the appointment of chair-man made by the Minister or by themeeting? Your record does not say so,simply giving it as &quot;Colonel Richardson,chairman.&quot;Mr. Anderson: The meeting could notappoint the chairman. The normal procedure is that the Minister invites somebody to actas chairman and the evidence in this casesuggests that this procedure was followedhere.Sir George Clark: I understood fromthis minute that the Minister actually in-invited Colonel Richardson to act as chair-man. What was the tenor of the conversa-tion on the subject? I should like to knowwho that conversation was with, and whothe Minister was at the time who askedColonel Richardson. It seems to me thatthere is so much to be taken for grantedhere and, like Dr. Quin, I am not entirely-satisfied the way this case has been pre-sented.Mr. Anderson: The minute was asking the manager at Enniskillen the tenor of his conversation with Colonel Richardson. Heevidently reported that he had had a con-versation with Colonel Richardson but i could not say, without checking, who theMinister was.Dr. Quin: The conversation about whowould be chairman?Mr. Anderson: Yes.The Chairman: And you say that colonel richardson was not a member of the com-mittee before he was appointed chairman?Mr. Anderson: No.
The Chairman: Under what regulations-can a person be appointed chairman if heis not a member of the committee?Mr. Anderson: The Schedule to the Actprovides:The central advisory council and each district advisory committee shall consistof members appointed by the Ministry,being (a) one person appointed by the Minis-try as being an independent person to act as chairman; and,(b) such other persons ...The Chairman: And that appointmentwould make him a member of the com-mittee?Mr. Anderson: A member and chairman.Mr. Pollock: Is it the opinion of theMinistry that Colonel Richardson was amember and chairman of the Committeefrom December, 1945, to January, 1956.Mr. Anderson: Yes.The Chairman: There was no meetingof the committee over a period of fouryears.Dr. Quin: And no report of the panelsto the main committee. I am still not satis-fied with the terms of appointment. It isnot covering a specific period.The Chairman: I do not think anymember of the committee is satisfied. Un-fortunately, as Mr. Anderson has toldyou, no regulations were made setting outthe terms of the appointment and the tenure of office.Mr. Anderson: That is so.The Chairman: I do not think Mr.Anderson can tell us anything further inview of that statement. Need we there-fore detain him any longer?Dr. Quin: I think we ought to be properly advised on this matter. That wouldbe only fair to Colonel Richardson. Hehas been asked, or expected, to take the brunt of this whole matter. In my opinion there was an obligation on the Ministry tokeep Colonel Richardson right on thisquestion of employment. I looked for in-formation as to the terms of appointmentfor the purpose of ascertaining if, underthe renewal of the appointment, his atten-tion had, in fact, been drawn to his posi-tion.The Chairman: As I have stated, Mr.Anderson is here to tell us what he canabout the memorandum. He has already stated that no regulations were made, andI do not think he can be of further service to the Committee at the moment. I donot say that with any disrespect to Mr.Anderson. It is a matter that we will haveto go into ourselves. Having heard thequestion discussed, perhaps in conversa-tion with the Permanent Secretary of theMinistry he may be able to find some-thing.Dr. Quin: Is there any possibility of any evidence being submitted by the ministry on this matter?The Chairman: I do not think Mr.Anderson is in a position to answer that question.Dr. Quin: Could Mr. Anderson make an inquiry?Mr. Anderson: I certainly will.Dr. Quin: Frankly, I am not satisfiedthat we have any evidence that can beaccepted.The Chairman: That is a matter for discus-sion between members of the Committee.There is no use keeping Mr. Anderson hereany longer. Mr. Anderson, would you seethe Permanent Secretary and tell him theposition and how the Committee feel aboutthe matter. If you get anything that throwsany light on the matter will you let MajorThomson know?Mr. Anderson: I will. I will have copiesof the Minutes made.The Chairman: Would you have copiesmade of the matters referred to in thememorandum submitted by the managerof the exchange.Mr. Anderson: You mean the matters referred to at the first meeting?The Chairman: Yes. Can we have copiesof these?Mr. Anderson: Yes.Mrs. Greeves: could we also have theletter which Colonel Richardson wrote tothe Ministry in 1945? It must be filed here.The Chairman: I have asked for that and they have not a copy of it.Sir George Clark: I want to see the letterfrom the Minister to Colonel Richardsonasking him to act as chairman of thecommittee. It is dated 14th December, 1945.The Chairman: You will see, Sir George,in the memorandum submitted that theDepartment say they have not a copy ofthat letter.Dr. Quin:  Why not?Sir George Clark: Then there is no evidence.Mr. Anderson: There is the indirectevidence of the minutes to and from the manager which I have quoted.Dr. Quin: Indirect evidence does notestablish any position.The Chairman: The only letter before theCommittee is the letter dated 16th January,1956, from Colonel Richardson stating, &quot; Iherewith tender my resignation as member and chairman of County Fermanagh Dis-ablement Advisory Committee.&quot; That isthe only evidence.Sir George Clark: We have no direct evidence. As a Committee are we supposed to accept indirect evidence? I ask you thatas Chairman.
The Chairman: We are going to seeColonel Richardson and see if he has acopy of the letter. The Ministry cannot help us on the matter.Mr. Pollock: Would it be any help ifwe had the Secretary of the Enniskillenbranch and his records brought here? after all this memorandum which has been readout to us must be taken from some records of meetings.The Chairman: This is just a general statement.Mr. Anderson: It is. We have given you the supporting evidence such as it is. Thereis this correspondence with the manager andthe fact that Colonel Richardson functionedand has resigned.The Chairman: The manager has no power to appoint Colonel Richardson.Mr. Anderson: I am merely saying thatthat is the evidence. It is a matter for you.It is evidence that there was a letter addressed by the Minister to colonel richardson and that Colonel Richardsonreplied to that letter.Dr. Quin: That is not evidence.Mr. Anderson: I am merely stating what we can produce.Dr. Quin: It is not fair to Mr. Anderson.We will have to make up our own mindsand deal with the matter in the way wethink best. Mr. Anderson has been given a very nasty job to do. As far as I amconcerned I should like him to understandthere is nothing personal in regard to themanner in which he has carried out his duty.The Chairman: Mr. Magowan&apos;s letter isthat no response has been received to theMinisters invitation.Mr. Pollock: There is just one point thatmight possibly help the issue. The pro-posal that Colonel Richardson should be chairman must be on a minute in a filesomewhere.Mr. Anderson: Not necessarily.Mr. Pollock:  Surely Mr. Magowan orsomebody else in the office would haveknown of Colonel Richardson.  Is it notcustomary for suggestions to be put for--&apos;ward  by an official in the form of a minute, and then approved?Mr. Anderson: Not necessarily. Theimportant matter of the appointment of chairman might be discussed only by senior officials.Mr. Pollock: Is there no record on a fileto the effect &quot;See if Colonel Richardsonwill act&quot; or words to that effect?Mr. Anderson: There only is this letter.The Chairman: Somebody out of the bluesaid, &apos;We will make Colonel Richardsonchairman.&quot;Mr. Anderson: No doubt there was a discussion.The Chairman: Is there a record of thosewho took part in that discussion?Mr. Anderson: I will see what we can produce on that. I do not think there isvery much in writing.The Chairman: You see the difficulty inwhich the Committee finds itself?Mr. Anderson: I do.The Chairman: We must know whether hewas a member of the committee and whoappointed him. In view of the conversa-tions we haye heard about to-day and thedoubt which exists in the minds of themembers of the Committee, perhaps you could have a discussion with the Perma-nent Secretary of your Ministry and seeif he can find anything for us.Dr. Quin: I am still anxious that furtherinquiries should be made on this questionof terms of appointment.The Chairman: Mr. Anderson will do that. He will also realise that this Com-mittee is working at top speed and thatthis is not a matter for delay.Mr. Anderson: I know it is an urgentmatter.The Chairman: Thank you very much,Mr. Anderson.The Committee adjourned until 2-30 p.m.on Thursday, 26th January.
Minutes of EvidenceTHIRD DAYTHURSDAY, 26th JANUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met on Thursday, 26th January, 1956, bypermission of the Senate, at Rossfad, Ballinamallard, County Fermanagh, forthe purpose of taking the evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry SacheverellCarleton Richardson, O.B.E., D.L.There were present: Sir Wilson Hungerford (in the Chair), Mrs. Greeves,and Mr. Pollock.The Chairman: We were sorry to learnof your illness, Colonel Richardson, and ourvisit to you to-day is because we havebeen appointed to inquire into your positionas a Senator due to the appointment youheld as chairman of the advisory committee set up in Enniskillen district in connectionwith the Disabled Persons Employment Act.It is necessary for us, before arriving at adecision as a Select Committee, to ask yousome questions. Firstly, can you tell us when you were appointed as chairman of thecommittee?Lieut-Colonel Richardson: In December,1945.The Chairman: Had you been previouslyappointed a member of that committee?Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: No.Have you got a letter of appointment? Unfortunately I have not.Can you remember who wrote to you? It was the Minister of Labour at thattime who, I think, was Mr. Maginess, butI would not swear to that although I thinkit was he who was Minister. I am speakingfrom memory but I think he wrote and invited me to be chairman of this advisorycommittee. I replied that in 1946 I was going to be away from home for consider-able periods and that possibly they mightprefer to appoint somebody else, but thatpassed over, they accepted me, and the firstmeeting was held, I will not say exactly,but early in 1946, in Enniskillen.At which you were sitting as chairman? Yes, and met the other appointed membersof the committee.When you got the letter from the minister was it to the Minister that you wroteaccepting? As far as I &quot;remember. He said in some letter that has transpired since thathe had not had a reply from me when theywrote, but so far as I remember the replywent later, the reason for the delay being that I was not at home at the time.Can you remember, when he was askingyou to be chairman, if he suggested any terms regarding the appointment, such aslength of time or anything like that? Ido not think so.When you had this meeting of theadvisory committee early in 1946 wherewas it held? In Enniskillen.And at which you took the chair auto-matically? Yes.Can you remember if minutes were madeof that meeting? The only man who couldtell you that definitely you are asking mea definite question to which my answer isthat I cannot remember would be Mr.Lyness, who was secretary to the committee.So far as you know no question was everraised as to the tenure of your office? No.And you never relinquished the appoint-ment until now? No.Can you remember how often that com-mittee sat? I would say that in all thoseyears the maximum number of times wecould possibly have sat was six; possiblyless.At those meetings would the minutes ofthe previous meetings be read, or were there any? I cannot remember, but of courseone can assume they were read, just like anyother ordinary meeting.We were wondering if the Departmentkept minutes? I should think you wouldbe able to find that out.Can you remember when you last sat as chairman? It is over two years ago. Yousee, this committee did not have to meetso frequently because panels were appointedto deal with cases generally, and there were also enforcement officers.Was it not the duty of the advisorycommittee to consider cases of hardshipor something like that? Yes.And an enforcement officer would nothave anything to do so far as they were concerned? The enforcement officer would try to place the man, but not to judge ona man&apos;s ability or disability.Did the panels make a report at the endof the year of the number of cases they haddealt with? Not that I know of.And did you go on to any of these panelsat all? No, I was not on them. I was just chairman of the main committee. when we did have a meeting there was somebodyfrom the Ministry of Labour. Belfast, whowas really the &quot; know-all,&quot; who was up todate in all the stuff.Mrs. Greeves: Did he keep the minutes?Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: One wouldcertainly think that the Ministry of labour would have done that.
The Chairman: Did you claim for anytravelling or other allowances?Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: No.Did you get a notice on your appointmentor subsequent to that setting out whatallowances and things could be obtained? I do not think so.Would you remember if you ever got amemorandum or document which is knownas &quot; 150 &quot;? I think that has been sent tome since, two or three days ago, but i cannot remember anything like that. Thequestion of emoluments never entered my mind at all.So far as you know from memory you didnot get a copy of this form?- I do notthink so.What information, if any, did you haveconcerning the payment of travelling orother allowances when you were firstelected to the Senate in 1949? I cannotremember any information but on the otherhand there may have been a sheet like thatsent along. If it did come to me I did not do anything about it.When was it first brought to your notice that you might be disqualified? About six weeks&apos; ago possibly. Mr. West, UnionistM.P. for Enniskillen, mentioned this to mehere one evening, and to tell you the truthI did not really understand what it was allabout at that early stage.Then acting on that you subsequentlyresigned? It was considerably later that Iresigned.It was on the 16th lanuary that youwrote? -Yes.Mr. Pollock: That was 10 days ago.Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: Quite.The Chairman: Have you any idea whyyou sent your resignation to the secretaryof the advisory committee and not to theMinistry?Lieut-Colonel Richardson: I should have sent it to the Ministry but at the time i thought it should go through the place where we sat, and the local secretary wouldthen send it on to whoever it should go to.In other words, for the secretary to for-ward it on to the Ministry? Yes.Is there any special significance in whyyou resigned from the membership of theadvisory committee as well as from theoffice of chairman? No.You were chairman but you were not amember of the committee? As chairman,of course, I was.But you had not been a member of thecommittee and then appointed by the com-mittee as chairman? No.You were appointed by the Minister?- -Yes.And it certainly was a letter from theMinister that you got and not a request from Mr. Lyness, the local secretary? That is so.Mr. Lyness rang you up to see? No,not until I rang him up.The lapse of time, about 11 years, is solong that we appreciate the difficulty, butwe found that in the Ministry they had not got 3&apos;our reply to the Minister and they therefore rang up Mr. Lyness to ask if hecould get in touch with you. He sub-sequently wrote to say that you had informed him that you had written to theMinister to the effect that you were preparedto act? He was able to tell them thatstraight off.But you acted entirely on the letter fromthe Minister appointing you and not onthe basis of Mr. Lyness having appointedyou?-Quite so. It is a pity that that letterof the Ministers is not available but as you say it is 10 or 11 years ago now.Mrs. Greeves: I do not think there is anything which I wish to ask further.Mr. Pollock: To clarify the situation arising out of a question I asked at our meeting on Tuesday, are you quite satisfiedthat you were appointed by the minister as chairman of the committee?Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: I am satisfiedso far as I reasonably can be withoutwritten evidence.Do you remember if there were any instructions in the letter giving you termsof reference as to what your duties wouldbe? I do not think so. I should like tobe able to say &quot; No,&quot; but all I can say isthat I do not think so.When you went to the first meeting howdid you know what you were going todo? I remember conferring with Mr.Lyness at the start, but one would imagine that there would have been a letter ofexplanation or something ; there should havebeen.The Chairman: Setting out your dutiesyou mean?Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: Expoundingthe duties, and there may have been, but you see, like the rest of this business, ifthere was I cannot remember it. It is all such a long time ago.When Mr. West came to tell you thatthere might be this question can you remem-ber if you went to the Senate after he had told you? I may have. Let me see yes,I went once but it is a good while ago.Mr. West said there was a possibility of trouble, and I did not really understand what it was all about.Are you by any chance a member of thecounty agricultural committee? No. I amchairman of the Enniskillen Savings Bank,but that is not a Government bank.Are you holding any office under theNational Insurance Act on industrial in-juries? No.Or the appeals tribunal? No.Well then I think that is everything. Iwas chairman of the Territorial Forces&apos;Association and I wonder if that would apply.The Secretary:  Who appointed you.?
17Lieut.-Colonel Richardson: Her Majesty&apos;sLieutenant for the County of Fermanagh.The Chairman: You could charge travel-ling allowances if you liked, but there were no emoluments which is really the point,and not the tavelling allowances. Did youresign from that a good time ago? Yes,three or four years ago. I should say threeyears ago.The Chairman: I think that clears upall the points about which we had to troubleyou. Thank you very much.The Committee adjourned until 11-30 a.m.on Monday, 30th January.
Minutes of EvidenceFOURTH DAYMONDAY, 30th JANUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Monday, 30th January, 1956.There were present:- Sir Wilson Hungerford (in the Chair); Mrs. Greeves,Sir George Clark, Mr. J. H. H. Pollock, and Dr. H. Quin.Major J. W. McConnell, C.B.E., Secretary, and Mr. H. Anderson, assistant secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, were in attendance.The Chairman: I have to report to theCommittee that Mrs. Greeves, Mr. Pollockand myself visited Colonel Richardson athis home at Rossfad, County Fermanagh,on Thursday, 26th January, and he in-formed us that he had been asked in Decem-ber, 1945, by the then Minister of labour to accept the post of chairman of the dis-trict advisory committee, which he agreed todo, and that he presided over a meetingearly in 1946. Since that time he had pre-sided, to the best of his knowledge, at about six meetings, the last one being about two years ago. At no time did he receive any payment or allowances for travelling expenses, nor did he ever make any claim for them. It was brought to his noticeabout six weeks ago by Mr. West, M.P.,that the question of his disqualificationmight be raised, and on the 16th Januaryof this year Colonel Richardson tenderedhis resignation. Colonel Richardson also in-formed the Committee that he was not amember of any other statutory committee.I think that is the gist of what took place a tour interview.Mrs. Greeves: I agree.The Chairman: What is the next thingwe have to do?The Secretary: Major McConnell andMr. Anderson of the Ministry of labour are here, and they might like to amplifyor correct some of the evidence which Mr.Anderson gave to the Committee. I havealso arranged for the manager at Ennis-killen to be in attendance if he is required.The Chairman: We are very glad to seeyou, Major McConnell. You probably heard from Mr. Anderson what took place at our previous meeting, and undoubtedly you will agree that the Committee were left some-what hazy as to who had made the ap-pointment, how it had been made, and what were the conditions and terms of that ap-pointment. We should be very glad indeedif you could help to clear away the doubtswhich we have.Major McConnell: Thank you verymuch. If there is any help I can give Ishall be very glad to do so. Mr. Andersonhas reported about the position, and if you would approve he would like to put in oneor two points in amplification of what hesaid on the last occasion.The Chairman: Certainly.Mr. Anderson: The first thing I should like to do is to correct some evidence Igave on the last day the full Committeemet. You will remember that you adjourned for a few minutes so that I might make in-quiries on two points, one being as towhether statutory regulations governing theprocedure of the committees had beenmade, and, secondly, whether, if such re-gulations had been made, they containedprovision about the term of office of thechairman and members of the committee.When I came back I informed you, in ac-accordance with the information given me,that no such regulations had been made.I subsequently found that that was incorrect.Regulations on procedure actually weremade in September, 1945, and I have gota copy here which I can give to the Com-mittee, but those regulations are completelysilent so far as any term or limit on theoffice of the chairman and members of thecommittee is concerned. I should like tomake that perfectly clear.The Chairman: There was no term?Mr. Anderson: There are regulations, but those regulations make no provision what-ever about the term of office of the chair-man and members of the Committee. Thatis the first point. The second point was inregard to the first meeting of the committee held in May, 1946, and you asked me if i could get the minutes. I have done so. Ithink the particular point of interest was whether the minutes of that meeting hadbeen signed by Colonel Richardson. I have got the actual minute of the meeting, andit is signed by Colonel Richardson, on the10th June, 1947, which was the date of thenext meeting. You may remember also thatin that record of the proceedings reference was made to two memoranda, Nos. 1 and 2,and the Committee asked if I could getcopies of those. I have done so. MemorandumNo. 1 gives explanations for the guidanceof the committees on certain provisions ofthe Act; for instance, on the qualifications for putting a disabled person on the re-gister, what constitutes a disabled person,
what is meant by the term &quot;ordinarily re-sident,&quot; and on certain disqualificationsfrom entry to the register. It deals withexplanatory matters of that kind. Memor-andum No. 2 is a description of the con-stitution of the committees and theirprocedure, but again it is completely silent,just as the regulations to which I have re-ferred are silent, about the term or limit of the office of the chairman or members.Dr. Qiiin: What was the date of the firstmeeting?Mr. Anderson: The first meeting was on14th May, 1946, and the next meeting on10th June, 1947. Colonel Richardson&apos;s sig-nature is dated 10th June, 1947.Dr. Quin: Was there anything in thefirst minutes dealing with the constitutionof the committee?Mr. Anderson: Nothing whatever. in point of fact, I read you a copy, which ap-pears in the transcript of evidence.The Chairman: The constitution of thecommittee is stated in memorandum No. 2?Mr. Anderson: The constitution of thecommittee is set out in this supporting me-morandum.The Chairman: Do we take it that theminutes of these meetings were kept?Mr. Anderson: Yes. I have got themhere, but they are quite silent about the term of office.Mr. Pollock: I should like to suggestthat a copy of the regulations and the two memoranda be attached to the documents of the proceedings of this Committee.Mr. Anderson: I have given those to theSecretary, and I have copies here which I also hand in.Dr. Quin: Perhaps Mr. Anderson would inform us if his Ministry received any com-munication from any source on the subjectof disqualification of Members of Parlia-ment in respect of their membership of thecommittee.The Chairman: We were informed thatin 1945 Sir Hartley Shawcross drew atten-tion across the water to the possibility ofdisqualification and that a memorandum was submitted over there relating to suchdisqualifications. Did we by any chance get it over here? I think that is the point that dr. Quin wants to bring out.Dr. Quin: Did the various Ministrieshere get it?Mr. Anderson: Certainly not so far asI know.Dr. Quin: Would Major McConnell beable to deal with that point?Major McConnell: I would be speakingfrom memory alone. I cannot recall anyquestion about that time of that sort.The Chairman: At any rate, at that timeyou were on a different portion of work inthe Ministry from what you are on now?Major McConnell: I think we would.all have known, about it: It would be commonpractice in the Department for a documentlike that to be circulated, at least to Assis-tant Secretaries. That is&apos; what happened re-cently. We have not brought to light thequestion of disqualification in regard tothese committees. We have merely suppliedthe information as well as we could.Dr. Qttiri: To whom?Major McConnell: To the Ministry ofFinance.Dr. Quin: This matter, then, has been raised by the Ministry of Finance, and not by your Ministry?Major McConnell: Not at all by ourMinistry.The Chairman: As far as your ministry is concerned, may I take it that you were quite unaware of any question of disquali-fication in consequence of these commit-tees?Major McConnell: Absolutely. In fact,to elaborate a little, if I may, on theevidence that was given by Mr. Andersonon Thursday. I should like to saythat these committees were set up,if you remember, just about the end of thewar. The question of disabled ex-Servicemen was very much in our minds at thetime, and also there was a considerableawakening of the public conscience aboutcivilian disabled people, too. So this legis-lation was passed on the other side. It waspassed by us, and we considered at the timewhether we would reconstitute all the local employment committees to deal with this service. The local employment committees,of which there was one attached to eachemployment exchange, had somewhat falleninto disuse during the war as there wasnot time to operate all 26 or 27 committeeswhen we had to move pretty quickly inour executive decisions. So instead of doingthat, we decided and the normal methodof doing this in the Department is for senior officers to discuss with the secretary and, possibly with the Minister, what is thebest procedure that we would have onlynine district committees and a central coun-cil. We grouped these committees. For ex-ample, the Enniskillen committee covers thelocal office areas both of Enniskillen andOmagh. Those are not geographically de-fined areas; it is left to workpeople to goto whichever exchange is convenient. Thatin itself is a loose sort of definition, but itis enough that we had district committees,where appropriate, to advise the ministry on these matters. Certainly if you had askedany of us at that time, &quot;Are you appoint-ing these people to office?&quot; I think wewould have said, &quot;No, we are appointingthem to advise and assist; the committees have no executive functions to perform;members are doing this as a public serviceout of goodwill, because they are people
interested in this class of the community.&quot;One of the things that the central councildid, for example, was to advise I amspeaking now from recollection   that although a 3 per cent, quota for disabled persons was required in Great Britain, a 21per cent, quota would be enough in North-ern Ireland. I am just giving you that asan example. It was more in the nature of advice. There was no need to have anysigned decision from any of the commit-tees. Probably the reason we did not make regulations about time limits or anything like that was because these were advisorycommittees and the members were free to resign if they pleased. I am sure it wasunthinkable that we would be asking some-body who would be giving service on thecommittee to resign.The Chairman: Of course, they are allcovered by that form A/cs. 150, whetherthey were voluntary or not. That really doesnot concern the Committee. The fact that being on it they were able, if necessary, todraw allowances is the main point.Major McConnell: I appreciate that. Thewhole thing is seen in quite a differentperspective to-day. We are referring to aposition at the end of the war, some 10years ago, and it does look very muchdifferent to-day, I am sorry to say.The Chairman: We have got to dealwith it as it is to-day.Dr. Quin: May we bring it up to date?Since that time may I take it that yourMinistry have not received anything in theway of a communication from any sourcewhich would cause you to be obliged to warn anyone that they were infringing onthe subject of disqualification of Member-ship of Parliament?Major McConnell: No, not to my know-ledge or recollection.Mr. Anderson: As the Prime ministers aid, I am not sure if he mentioned it in the senate, but at any rate though inthe House of Commons, arising, I think,out of the Beattie case the Ministry ofFinance had instituted an inquiry and untilthe Ministry of Finance came to do it we hadno information whatever. They were hand-ling the whole thing. As a matter of fact,we were not quite clear even what the objectof the Ministry of Finance inquiry was,although we had a fair notion, but theywere handling the whole thing and wemerely supplied the information for whichwe were asked, and until then we had no knowledge of it.The Chairman: The investigation wascarried out by the Ministry of Finance.Dr. Quin: My reason for asking thesequestions is that there might be a very strong impression in the minds of people that the Ministry was negligent in notkeeping right those whom they had involvedin risks.nThe Chairman:. I am afraid that is nota matter for this Committee.Major McConnell: I thought there wasa little more to Dr. Quin&apos;s question; i thought he was asking me if in my re-collection since 1945 there had been any-thing. I was leaving out of account thepresent circumstances which brought it toour notice. I think it is fair not only to theMinistry of Labour but to civil servantsgenerally to say that it is the kind of thingfor which we do have a weather eye open.We have been very careful, and particularlyin my own knowledge and discussion withthe particular Minister, about asking Mem-bers or Senators. We often had to resist the temptation, if I might put it that way,when trying to get somebody-a Memberof either House whom it was particularly desirable in the public interest to have, ifany thought crossed our mind at all thatthere might be some possible disqualifica-tion. It certainly is not a new subject, butit is new in the present form and there wasno precise reason for having it on ourmind apart from the general principle.Sir George Clark: I assume that this s.R. &amp; O. No. 109 of 1945 was given to colonel Richardson at some time when he took up his appointment as chairman of thecommittee?Mr. Anderson: That I could not tell you,but memorandum No. 2 which you will findattached to the record of the minutes of thefirst meeting is really based on this regu-lation. You will see that paragraph 2 of that memorandum states:Section 17 of the Act requires theMinistry to establish a central advisorycouncil and district advisory committees.The district advisory committees will be known as Disablement Advisory Com-mittees. Para. 5 of the Second Scheduleto the Act empowers the Ministry tomake regulations with respect to the pro-cedure of the Committees and such re-gulations the Disabled Persons (DistrictAdvisory Committees and Panels) (Pro-cedure) Regulations (Northern Ireland),1945 were made on 13th September,1945.In point of fact that memorandum isbased on Regulation No. 109.Sir George Clark: Would it be right tosay that the actual regulations were nevergiven to Colonel Richardson?-1 could nottell you definitely.But it would be right to assume thatthey were never given to him or that he never saw them? I think it is quite pos-sible that he never saw them.Unless he got them from your Ministryit is unlikely that he would have seen them?-Yes.The Chairman: But like all Members ofthe Senate he would get a copy of all theStatutory Rules, Orders and Regulations.
Mr. Anderson: Not in 1945 because I do- not think he was a Member of the Senateat that time.Sir George Clark: This Regulation No.109 sets out what would disqualify a mem-ber of committee but it makes no reference.Mr. Anderson: 1 beg your pardon. Thismerely is disqualification to act on a panelin a case in which he was personally in-interested.Sir George Clark: Nor does it make any reference at all to any form of paymenteven for travelling allowances?-No.So that no reference whatsoever was madein this document as to payment or paymentof allowances and even if he did read ithe was in no way to imagine that he mightbe entitled to allowances or payment? In the letters issued, that we cannot pro-duce, I think the Minister said that therewas no salary attached to the appointmentbut that allowances would be paid in re-spect of travelling and subsistence expenses.Where is that stated; it is not in theregulations? I do not wish to waste the timeof the Committee with these questions or toraise any hares, but it would seem thatthere was no reason for Colonel Richardsonto think from any official document that he received that he would get any allowancesor payment, because it was never in anyway brought to his notice. Is that not so, Mr.Anderson? The assumption is that he was probably   informed   that   he   would   gettravelling allowance but no salary.&apos;   Sir  George  Clark:   That  reference  totravelling allowances or expenses does not seem to appear in this S.R. &amp; O. No. 109?-No.The Chairman: You quoted to us an ex-tract from some document to the effect thatno salary was attached to the appointmentbut that travelling allowances would beallowed. What was that?Mr. Anderson: It is copy of a letterthe Minister sent to a member of the com-mittee.But not the one sent to Colonel Richard-son? No.On the question of expenses and whetherForm 150 was sent to Colonel Richardson,you have no record of the thing being sentto him? No.The Chairman: Colonel Richardsoncould not recollect whether he had receivedit or not. I do not think there is anythingfurther in which the Ministry can help usbut if something crops up we will take ad-vantage of sending for you.Major McConnell and Mr. Andersonwithdrew from the Committee.The Committee adjourned until 11-30a.m. on Wednesday, 1st February.
Minutes of EvidenceFIFTH DAYWEDNESDAY, 1st FEBRUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Wednesday, 1st February, 1956.There were present: Sir Wilson Hungerford (in the Chair), Sir GeorgeClark, Mrs. Greeves, Mr. Pollock and Dr. Quin.The Chairman: Two points have been raised by Dr. Quin during our discussions,and I suggest that we recall the Attorney-General for his advice.Agreed.The Attorney-General recalled.The Chairman: Mr. Attorney-General,we are very grateful to you for coming at such short notice, and feel sorry to haveto bring you up on such a morning.Dr. Quin: I join the Chairman in that.The Attorney-General (Mr. Warnock): ItIt is quite all right. I said that I would, beat the service of the Committee at any time.The Chairman: We did not think wewould have to invite you up at such short notice. The point that worried us very much is in the first paragraph of the second schedule of the Disabled Persons (Employ-ment) Act, 1945, where it is stated:1 (1) The central advisory council and each district advisory committee shallconsist of members appointed by theMinistry, being (a) one person appointed by the Minis-&apos;try as being an independent person to act as chairman;The Attorney-General: What is the diffi-culty?The Chairman: The difficulty hingesround the meaning of the word &quot; indepen-dent&quot;. Independent of what?The Attorney-General: I think it isanswered by 1(b), which gives us the other persons on the council. It says:such  number of other persons as theMinistry may determine in the case ofthe said council, or of that committee,as the case may be, including an equal number of persons appointed by it, afterconsultation with such organisations rep-resenting employers and workers respec-tively, or both employers and workers, asthe   Ministry  thinks   fit,   to   representemployers and workers respectively.It would appear to me that that means thatyou are to  have  representatives  of  theemployers and representatives of the wor-kers,  and  one  person  who  shall  standneutral between the two.Dr. Quin: But we ought to draw theattention of the Attorney-General to thefact that there are representatives of employ-ers and representatives of workers, andother persons.The Attorney-General: You say &quot; rep-representatives of the employers and represen-tatives of workers, and other persons&quot;?Dr. Quin: Yes.The Attorney-General: I do not think itis quite right when you say other persons?&quot;Dr. Quin: The word &quot; including&quot; was used in the Second Schedule, paragraph 1(b).&quot; Including&quot; implies that they do not entirely consist of those persons, and, infact, that is borne out by the statement issued on the matter.The Attorney-General: I have now got the memorandum, which I did not see be-fore.Dr. Quin: The point is this. I raised thequestion of the word &quot;including&quot;. Had itbeen the intention that the committeeshould consist of representatives of cm-ployers and of workers only, the word &quot;in-cluding&quot; would properly have been &quot;com-prising&quot; or &quot;consisting of&quot;, and the inferenceI drew from that was there were intendedto be more on that committee than workers&apos;and employers&apos; representatives. That isborne out by the memorandum to whichyour attention has been drawn. Therefore,the chairman must be an independent per-son. Independent of what or who? Since itcannot be taken that he is independent ofpart of the committee, namely the em-ployers&apos; representatives and the workers&apos;representatives, he must be independent ofthe whole committee. How can he be in-dependent of the committee and yet be ofthe committee? That is the point.The Attorney-General: I have not the slightest doubt he is a member of thecommittee. That is not in dispute at all. Hewas appointed by the Ministry to be an in-dependent person to act as chairman of thecommittee.Dr. Quin: In what respect &quot;inde-pendent&quot;?The Attorney-General: I have no doubt at all. I think you must go back to theStatute rather than any interpretation placed upon the Statute by the Ministry of Labour.I would say that the plain reading of theStatute is that the chairman who is to beappointed is a person who is to stand in-dependent and occupy a neutral position asbetween two bodies who are specifically mentioned in the Statute.
Dr. Quin: There are two bodies andothers.The Attorney-General: Not in theStatute. The memorandum, I agree, providesfor a number of other persons with experi-ence.Dr. Quin: The use of the word &quot;includ-ing&quot; means surely more than or somethingdifferent from &quot;comprising&quot; or &quot;consistingof&quot;?The Attorney-General: Possibly, but Istill do not get your difficulty, Senator Quin.Dr. Quin: My difficulty is this. If thechairman is a person independent of thecommittee then when we come to para-graph 4, the question of allowances to reim-burse expenses and compensation for loss of renumerative time applies not to the chair-man but to the committee, and, therefore,the chairman, who is independent, is not provided for in regard to the allowances of expenses and compensation for loss of re-remunerative time. That is the point.The Attorney-General: That would in-volve a decision that the chairman wasnot a member of the committee. Para-graph (4) says:There shall be paid ... to the mem-bers of the said council . . .Dr. Quin: If it had been intended to in-clude the chairman it should have said &quot;thechairman and the members&quot;.The Attorney-General: Paragraph 1 (1)states:The central advisory council and each district advisory committee shall consistof members appointed by the Ministry,being (a) one person appointed by the Minis-try as being an independent person toact as chairman:I would suggest he is clearly constituted amember of the committee.Dr. Quin: Yes, but the two phrases arein conflict.The Attorney-General: I am afraid I donot follow that.Dr. Quin: By the use of the word &quot;in-cluding&quot; he is independent of what?The Attorney-General: I have no doubt in my own mind that his position is thatof neutrality between the two sides speci-fically mentioned in the Statute.Dr. Quin: Three sides.The Attorney-General: There are notthree sides, in my opinion.Dr. Quin: Paragraph 1 (l)(b) refers toother persons, &quot;including&quot;. It does not say&quot;comprising&quot;. It implies clearly that they donot constitute the entire committee but areincluded in the committee. As a matter of fact, there have been other persons appointed on these committees apart from employers&apos; representatives and workers&apos;representatives,The attorney general: So I gather.Dr. Quin: And that is based, apparently,on the word &quot;including&quot;.The Attorney-General: Maybe.The Chairman: Paragraph 1 (1) of theSecond Schedule states The central advisory council and each district advisory committee shall consistof members appointed by the Ministry,being (a) one person appointed by the Ministryas being an independent person to actas chairman; May I take it that that definitely and clearly makes the chairman a member ofcommittee?The Attorney-General: I would unhesi-tatingly say so.Dr. Quin: I would say so if it stoppedthere, but it does not stop there. That ismy difficulty. It goes on to draw certainrestrictions. He is not there (a) as an em-ployers&apos; representative or (b) as a workers&apos;representative, or (c) such other persons.The Chairman: But it does state that thechairman, being an independent person, is amember of the committee. That is the onlypoint that is before this Committee.Dr. Quin: I go back again to where Istarted. There is a doubt on this. I amclearly in doubt as to what is implied bythe word &quot;independent&quot;, and nobody hastold me &quot;independent&quot; of what.The Chairman: I do not think that it affects the issue that the. Committee haveto decide.The Attorney-General: I do not see thatit matters at all of whom he is independent.In my view he is clearly appointed a mem-ber of the Committee.Dr. Quin: Why use the word &quot;inde-pendent&quot;?The Attorney-General: Sub-paragraph (b)shows why they use the word &quot;independent&quot;.He is to be independent of the two sidesthat are specifically mentioned in (b).Dr, Quin: Of three bodies.The Attorney-General: The Statute onlymentions two.The Chairman: The statute only says two.Dr. Quin: The Statute says including&quot;.It does not say &quot;comprising&quot; or &quot;consistingof&quot;, so the Statute itself implies more than two bodies.Mr. Pollock: Might we not have persons other than representatives of workers and employers who were representatives ofother bodies interested in disabled persons,and the intention is that under all circum-stances the chairman would be a personindependent of all interests connected withdisabled persons; that is, independent ofany category whatsoever?The attorney general: I think that isquite clear.
Dr. Quin: That is an interpretation one could place on it, but why use the word&quot;independent&quot;?The Chairman: I am afraid we are nothere to decide the interpretation.Dr. Quin: That, unfortunately, seems tobe what it comes down to.The Attorney-General: I can only give you my opinion on this. In my opinionColonel Richardson was clearly a memberof this committee, and under paragraph 4of the Second Schedule he was clearly en-titled to be paid the travelling and other allowances, including compensation for lossof remunerative time.Dr. Quin: May I take it that the Attorney-General, in his capacity as such, is advisingus that, no matter what doubts we have or may have, Colonel Richardson was a mem-ber of this committee and, as such, comes within the provisions of paragraph (4) ofthe Second Schedule?The Attorney-General: I would not pre-some to advise the Committee as to whatdecision they should arrive at. I am merelyhere to give my views on the true inter-pretation of the Second Schedule. What theCommittee do is a matter for them. Iwould not presume to advise them as towhat their decision should be. I ammerely here to give, to the best of my ability,my opinion on what is the true interpretation of the Act of Parliament. Further thanthat I do not go.Dr Quin: I take it that the true inter-pretation of the Act is that the second schedule must be taken to assume whether there is any doubt, as there is with me that the chairman is a member of the com-mittee?The. Attorney-General: In my opinion heis a member of the committee.Dr. Quin: That is the advice you are giving us?The Attorney-General: That is the adviceI am giving.Dr. Quin: That is what I want to get.I am dealing with the issue now. apart altogether from the question whetherColonel Richardson was, in fact, a memberof the committee. We got that form colonel Richardson&apos;s own evidence.The Chairman: The Attorney-General has given his opinion that, according to theSecond Schedule, Colonel Richardson as anindependent chairman was also a memberof the committee.Dr. Quin: And that, presumably, arisingout of that, the use of the word &quot; indepen-dent&quot; has no significance whatever?The Attorney-General: It has the signifi-cance which I pointed out, that the Statutecontemplated two  different bodies, as  itmspecifically states, &quot;the representatives ofthe workers and the representatives of the -employers&quot;, and the chairman was ap-pointed as independent of those two bodies.That is what independence means.Dr. Quin: We are accepting that advice,it being clearly understood that the word&quot; including &quot; really must be taken as stand-ing for &quot;comprising&quot; or &quot;consisting of&quot;.The Attorney-General: I would have thought myself that it meant what it says.It does not seem to me to matter whetherit is interpreted as meaning that it shouldbe exclusively composed of those two bodies or whether they bring in other persons interested in the disabled or not. I stillthink that Colonel Richardson stands as independent of every member of the com-mittee-as a neutral.Dr. Quin: We get the best advice we can and we, as sensible people, accept that, andwe could not get any better legal advice thanthat of the Attorney-General. He, after all,is the Law Officer to the Government. Asfar as I am concerned it has not solved the doubts in my mind, but I feel bound toaccept the advice.Sir George Clark: I should like to join with Senator Quin and accept the advice ofthe Attorney-General. I am very glad he came here and gave us his advice becauseSenator Quin had raised considerable doubt in my mind, and I could see a legal wranglegoing on, but I am very grateful to the attorney-General and accept what he hassaidi which has removed from my mind the doubt in this particular instance.Mrs. Greeves: I also am quite satisfied.The Chairman: We are most grateful toyou, Mr. Attorney-General, for having comealong as you have done and for alwaysplacing your advice so willingly and freelyat the Committee&apos;s service. It has helpedus very much to get over this little difficulty.You,, as a legal man, will know the legalpoints that arose in Dr. Quin&apos;s mind, andfrom which we, as laymen, shall I say, areluckily exempt.The Attorney-General: Very luckily, be-cause this whole subject has become soterribly technical that it is really a lawyer&apos;sparadise.The Chairman: We were afraid that thatis what it was going to develop into, andwe were not able to stand up to Dr. Quin,and thought you would not mind comingback to help us out of the difficulty.The Attorney-General: Thank you verymuch.The Attorney-General then withdrew.The Committee proceeded to considerthe Draft Report, and concluded theirdeliberations.

D. A. C. Memo. No. ministry of Labour Northern Ireland.Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945.REGISTER OF DISABLED PERSONS(1) This memorandum is circulated for the information of all concerned in the com-compilation of the Register of Disabled Persons under the Disabled Persons (Employment)Act, 1945. Copies should be made available for the Chairman and Members of districtadvisory committees when considering applications for admission to, or retention &quot;in, theRegister that have been referred to them for their recommendations.Qualifications for Entry(2) To obtain admission to the Register of Disabled Persons the applicant must showthat:  (a) he is a disabled person within the meaning of Section 1 of the Disabled Persons(Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945;(b) the disablement is such as will be likely to continue for six months or more from the date of entry in the register;(c) he is over school-leaving age;(d) he desires to engage in some form of remunerative employment or work on hisown account in Northern Ireland, and that he has a reasonable prospect ofobtaining and keeping such employment or work;(e) he is ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland; and that(f) his application has been made in the prescribed manner.Notes.(2a) &quot;Disabled Persons.&quot;The Act defines a disabled person as one v/ho, &quot;on account of injury, disease, orcongenital deformity, is substantially handicapped in obtaining or keeping employment or in undertaking work on his own account which, apart from that injury, disease ordeformity, would be suited to his age, experience and qualification.&quot;It follows from this that a person may have sustained a severe injury and yet not bea &quot;disabled person&quot; because, in fact, he has no difficulty in finding or keeping suitable employment. Thus a man who has lost a foot may be able to get and retain employment as a clerk, or in some other sedentary occupation, as easily as an uninjured competitor.On the other hand, a disablement that does not appear to be serious may in fact be aheavier handicap to employment or work on own account than some other more obviousinjury. Nerve troubles and slight mental deficiencies are instances in point, since the word&quot;disease&quot; covers mental as well as physical disabilities. The test for any applicant is theeffect of the disability on his prospects of obtaining or keeping employment in comparisonwith those of a person of similar age who is not disabled and who is employed in, orlooking for, the same kind of employment. If, on this standard, the applicant would be substantially handicapped in obtaining or keeping employment or working on his own account, he is a disabled person within the meaning of the Act.The phrase in the definition &quot;suited to his age, experience and qualifications&quot; shouldbe interpreted as at the time of the application. Thus a man who was an unskilled labourerbefore the war may have since learned a trade, or occupied a position of a considerableresponsibility; and if he is disabled he should be regarded as substantially handicapped if his disability seriously affects his chances of getting employment of a kind now suitablefor him even though it does not prevent him from returning to his pre-war occupation.Under the proviso to Section 7 (2) of the Act, a 1914-18 disablement pensioner (i.e..a person still receiving a disability pension from the 1914-18 war) is to be treated as adisabled person satisfying both conditions 2a and 2b.
(2d) Employment Prospects in Northern Ireland.An applicants prospects of obtaining and keeping employment and work on his own account should of course be considered with reference to the facilities and referencesthat would be at his disposal if he were admitted to the Register.(2c) &quot; Ordinarily Resident.&quot;The phrase &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; is not defined in the Act, and the following remarkscan, therefore, only be suggestions of the principal factors that should be considered when applying the test in particular cases.Of these, probably the most important is the actual time spent by the applicant inNorthern Ireland especially as compared with the time spent out of it; thus a youngman who had lived all his life in Northern Ireland until he enlisted in the Forces orwent to war work in Great Britain would in most cases be &quot;normally resident in NorthernIreland&quot; as soon as he returned to his home. But if he married in, say, England and set up in a business there, it might well be that his ordinary residence had shifted toEngland. The time element is, in fact, not quite conclusive by itself and should be con-sidered together with all the other circumstances of the cas;. If an applicants home and family connections are outside Northern Ireland and he is here only in a temporaryoccupation (even though it has lasted some years) the inference is that he is not ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland. If, however, he has obtained permanent work here and has brought his family with him and perhaps bought a house in Northern Ireland, the pre-sumption would probably be the other way.It would seem, therefore, that the relevant factors are the time spent by the applicantin Northern Ireland and his intentions as shown by the ties he has formed with thiscountry (such as buying a dwelling or a business) his personal or family connections with it, the temporary or permanent nature of his occupation and the severance or retention ofhis ties with another country.DISQUALIFICATIONS(3)   The applicant is disqualified from entry to the Register if:  (a) he is an inmate of a mental hospital or institution;(b) he is an inmate of a prison;(c) he is a whole time patient in a hospital, sanatorium or similar institution in circumstances which, in the opinion of the Ministry, make it impossible for himto undertake employment or work on his own account or attend a vocational training or industrial rehabilitation course; or(d) he is, in the opinion of the Ministry, a person of habitual bad character.Applications for Renewal of Registration(4)   These are subject to the same qualifications and disqualifications as mentioned inparagraphs 2 and 3 for new entrants.Disqualifications from Retention on Register(5)   These are:-(a) That the registered disabled person fails to continue to satisfy any of thecon-difions for new entrants set out in paragraph 2 above, or to be free from thedisqualifications set out in paragraph 3 above. s(b) That if a registered disabled person has been requested by the Ministry to attend a vocational training or rehabilitation course, he has, without reasonable cause,failed or neglected to attend or complete such course to the satisfaction of theMinistry.(c) That a registered disabled person has persistently and without reasonable causerefused to undertake employment or work on his own account which is suitablein his case.Note.Care should be taken to give proper weight to the protective phrase &quot;without reason-able cause&quot; in 5b and 5c above. Thus it would be reasonable to refuse work if it was not within the person!s physical capacity or the rate of wages and other conditions were notup to recognised standards.September, 1945.
D. A. C. Memo. No. 2.Confidential. Northern Ireland.Ministry of Labour for Northern Ireland.Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945.MEMORANDUM FOR DISABLEMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEESIntroductory1. The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, was broughtinto force on the 23rd July, 1945.2. Section 17 of the Act requires the Ministry to establish a central advisory counciland district advisory committees. The district advisory committees will be known asDisablement Advisory Committees (&quot;D.A.C.S.&quot;). Para. 5 of the Second Schedule to theAct empowers the Ministry to make Regulations with respect to the procedure of theCommittees and such regulations the Disabled Persons (District Advisory Committees andPanels) (Procedure) Regulations (Northern Ireland), 1945 were made on 13th September,1945.3. Under para. 2 of the Second Schedule to the Act each D.A.C. is required to establishone Panel, and may establish more Panels, and, with the exception mentioned in para. 7 (5)hereunder, may delegate to such Panels the duty of making recommendations to theMinistry on matters referred by it to the Committee under the Act.Constitution of Disablement Advisory CommitteesMembership.4. In accordance with para. 1 (1) of the Second Schedule to the Act, the chairmen and members of D.A.Cs. are appointed by the Ministry, and the constitution of eachCommittee is as follows:(1) an independent Chairman;(2) an equal number of persons appointed to represent employers and workersrespectively; and(3) a number of other persons with experience of or interest in the problem of disablement. In no case does the number Of other persons exceed one-half of the totalnumber of members of the Committee.5. In the absence of the Chairman of the Committee, his functions may be performed by a member of the Committee who has been authorised for that purpose. The authorisation-tion on behalf of the Ministry will be given at each meeting if the occasion arises.Functions of Committees6. The functions of the Committees are both advisory and executive. In their advisory capacity they arc called upon to survey the general problem of disablement in their districts and to make recommendations on any steps that should be taken to meet it. They will no doubt examine the working of the Act in practice, including the work of Panels, and take steps to make its provisions known to employers, trade unions and the general public in their districts. They are not charged with any duty in regard to vocational traininingand industrial rehabilitation since these schemes are not organised on a district basis, butthis does not preclude them from discussing the subjects in relation to the general problem in their own districts. The general duty of advising on problems of an advisory naturerests with the Committee itself and may not be delegated to a Panel. There is nothing,however, to prevent a Committee, if it so desires, setting up a special sub-committee (butnot a Panel) to deal with any particular aspect of its work.7. As regards their executive functions, Committees are required to make recom-mendations and reports on matters specifically referred to them under the various provi-sions of the Act (&quot;Referred Items&quot;), namely:  For Recommendations.(1) Applications for entry in the Register of Disabled Persons which are not ap-proved by the Ministry in the first instance (Section 7 (2) (b)).
(2) Removal of names from the Register owing to the non-fulfilment of a prescribedcondition or the incurring of a disqualification (Section 8 (3)).(3) Applications for reduction in an employer^ quota of registered disabled persons(Section 10 (5)). &quot;(4) Applications by employers for permits to engage persons other than registereddisabled persons in ordinary or designated employments where the employer so re-quests (Sections 11 (3) and 12 (3)).For Reports.(5) Reports on allegations of discharge of a registered disabled person without&quot; reasonable cause &quot; where immediately after such discharge the number of registereddisabled persons employed is below the employees quota (Section 9 (7)) under theprovisions of para. 2 of the Second Schedule to the Act, this question must beconsidered by the Committee itself and cannot be delegated to a Panel.8. The statutory provision for Panels has been made to enable the &quot;Referred Items&quot;specified in para. 7 (1) to (4) to be dealt with by Panels and it is expected that theCommittee will generally delegate the work accordingly.Recommendations and reports by Committees (and Panels) will be considered by officers of the Ministry specially selected to deal with disabled persons, i.e. DisablementRehabilitation Officers (&quot; D.R.Os.&quot;) at Employment Exchanges.Constitution of Panels10. Under the provisions of para. 2 of the Second Schedule to the Act each Commit-tee is required to set up one or more Panels. The purpose of a Panel will be to enablethe Committee to delegate matters of an executive character (see para. 8). It is assumed that Committees will make the maximum use of Panels for this purpose. The numberof Panels and their location will be for the Committee to decide in the light of thevolume of work likely to arise in the district.Membership of Panels11. Members of a Panel need not be members of the Committee, but Panel member-ship is subject to the approval of the Ministry. Committees will no doubt agree that each Panel should include, so far as possible, at least one member of the Committeein order to secure general co-ordination of the work. Where there is a member of aCommittee who is connected with the locality to be covered by a Panel, such membermight be included in the Panel membership.12. Each Panel should normally consist of five persons but this number may beincreased if desired. The five persons constituting a Panel should be:  (1) an independent person as Chairman ;(2) one person to represent employers ;(3) one person to. represent workers ;(4) one other person with experience of or interest in the problem of disablement;(5) one of the medical practitioners nominated for the purpose of a reference orreferences involving a medical question.Functions of Panels13. The functions of Panels will be limited to the making of recommendations on matters of the kind specified in para. 7 (1), (2), (3) and (4) which are referred by theMinistry to the Committee and which the Committee delegates to them. It is to be notedthat references calling for recommendation and report on allegations of discharge ofa registered disabled person without &quot;reasonable cause&quot; (Section 9 (7) of the Act) maynot, under para. 2 of the Second Schedule to the Act, be so delegated.Frequency of Meetings of Committees and Panels14. It is for the Committees to decide the frequency of their meetings in the lightof the volume of work and the extent to which &quot; Referred Items &quot; are delegated to Panels.
Dates of Meetings15. The Secretary to the Committee will consult the Chairman as to the subjects of an advisory nature to be discussed and the number and nature of the &quot;Referred Items&quot;(excepting those referred to in para. 7 (5)), which are to be dealt with by a Panel. Hewill also agree with the Chairman the dates of meetings of the Committee and its Panels.Issue of Notices and Agenda to Members of Committee or Panel16. Seven days&apos; notice of the time and place at which a Committee or Panel will sitwill be sent to members, except that in the case of Panels, the medical practitioners will normally be nominated in rotation for the hearing of references involving medicalquestions. An agenda will be issued with notices to members of a Committee wherematters of an advisory nature are to be discussed. It is not proposed, however, to issue an agenda giving particulars of &quot; Referred Items&quot; due to be considered by committees or Panels. In such cases particulars of each item will be prepared on case papers and acopy will be handed to each member who attends the meeting.Attendance of Officials17. The advice of the Employment Exchange Managers will be available to theCommittees and Panels. The Secretary to each Committee and Panel will be an officerof the Employment Exchange to which the Committee or Panel is attached. Officersof Government Departments may be present and speak at meetings of Committees andPanels, but they will not have the right to vote.April, 1946.Printed in Northern Ireland under the authority of Her Majcsty&apos;s Stationery Office byW. &amp; G.

REPORTYour Committee, appointed to consider whether the election of thefollowing Members, that is to say: Captain the Rt. Hon. Sir Norman Stronge, Bart.,The Rt. Hon. Sir William McCIeery,Dr. Eileen Hickey,is invalid on the ground that at the time of their election they held an office or place of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section 24 of the succession to the Crown Act, 1707; and to report whether such Membersappear on that account to have been incapable of election to this House, and,if so, what representations should be made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the matters to them referred and have agreed to thefollowing Report:Your Committee have held two meetings and have examined the attorney-General; Major J. W. McConnell, C.B.E., Secretary, Ministry ofLabour and National Insurance; Mr. R. Eagleson, Secretary, National Assist-ance Board; Mr. H. Anderson, Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour and national Insurance; Mr. T. Stanley Lyle, Assistant Secretary, Associationof Northern Ireland Chambers of Commerce, and the Members whose election to the House of Commons was under consideration. Memoranda were alsosubmitted by the Attorney-General and the Ministry of Labour and national insurance.Your Committee have also considered the Reports of the Select Com-mittees of the House of Commons at Westminster which were set up toconsider the cases of Mr. Charles Alfred Howell and Mr. Charles Beattie.Your Committee are advised that the law on the subject of disqualification-cation may be summed up as follows:Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, provides thatno person having an office of profit under the Crown shall be capable ofbeing elected, or of sitting or voting as a Member of the House of Commons.In 1793 the Irish Parliament passed the House of Commons disqualification-cation Act (Ireland), 1793. Section 1 of such Act imposed a similar dis-qualification in respect of membership of the Irish House of Commons.The House of Commons (Disqualifications) Act, 1801, Section 1, providedthat all persons disabled from or incapable of being elected, sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of Great Britain should be disqualified from being elected or sitting or voting in the House of commons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as Member for Great Britain.Section 2 provided similarly that all persons disqualified from being elected,sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of ireland should be disqualified from being elected, sitting or voting in the House ofCommons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Ireland.Section 3 provided that persons disqualified by British Statutes should notbe enabled to sit and vote in the House of Commons of the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom as Members for Ireland, nor should persons disqualifiedby Acts Of the Parliament of Ireland be enabled to sit or vote in the houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Great Britain.
Section 18(2) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, applied the lawfor the time being in force relating to the qualification and disqualificationof Members of the Commons House of Parliament of the United kingdom to the Members of the Senate and House of Commons of Northern Ireland.Dr. Eileen M. HickeyYour Committee find that Dr. Eileen M. Hickey accepted an appoint-ment, on the 10th September, 1945, as member of the Advisory Committeefor the Belfast Area set up under Section 30 of the Unemployment AssistanceAct (Northern Ireland), 1930. In November, 1955, the Board was recon-stituted and Dr. Hickey accepted reappointment to membership on 1stDecember, 1955, but resigned her membership on the 13th December, 1955.Dr. Hickey&apos;s membership of this advisory committee requires someexplanation.Section 30 of the Unemployment Act (Northern Ireland), 1934, estab-lished an Unemployment Assistance Board. It was renamed the assistance board for Northern Ireland by the Old Age and Widows Pension Act(Northern Ireland), 1940, and later renamed the National Assistance board for Northern Ireland by the National Assistance Act, 1948.Under the 1934 Act the Board was required to arrange for the estab-lishment of Advisory Committees for such areas as the Board thought fit,and Section 30 provided that the Board might pay to members of AdvisoryCommittees &quot;such travelling and other allowances including compensationfor loss of remunerative time&quot; as the Board after consultation with theMinister of Labour and with the consent of the Ministry of Finance, mightdetermine.The Act of 1934 was repealed by the National Assistance Act (Nor-thern Ireland), 1948, but Section 3 of the 1948 Act provides that the national assistance Board may arrange for the establishment of Advisory committees for such areas as the Board may think fit and further that the Board shall pay to members of Advisory Committees such travelling and other allowances,including compensation for loss of remunerative time, as the Board may determine. It was further provided that Advisory Committees appointed under the 1934 Act should, unless and until the Board otherwise determined,be deemed to be Advisory Committees established under Section 3 of theNational Assistance Act, 1948.Dr. Eileen Hickey was appointed a member of the Advisory Committeein September, 1945. She was invited to undertake this duty in a letter fromMr. Thomas Elwood, an officer of the Board, and she accepted the invitationby letter dated 10th September, 1945.In November, 1955, the Chairman of the Board was considering thereappointment of the Advisory Committee, and on 28th November, 1955,he invited Dr. Hickey to continue to act. On 1st December, 1955, Dr. Hickeyagreed to do so.It will be noted that Dr. Hickey&apos;s first appointment in 1945 resulted fromcorrespondence between herself and Mr. Thomas Elwood, then an officerof the Assistance Board, and that her appointment in December, 1955, resulted from the letters passing between herself and the Chairman of the Board.Both the Act of 1934 and the Act of 1948 contain the followingprovision:&quot;The functions of the Board, and of the officers and servantsappointed by the Board, shall be exercised on behalf of the Crown.&quot;In these circumstances your Committee are advised by the Attorney^General that in respect of her first, and subsequent appointments to the
Advisory Committee, Dr. Hickey held an office, and held it under theCrown, and the provision in both Statutes for payment of travelling andother allowances, including compensation for loss of remunerative time, would bring her case within the principles established by the Howell and Beattiecases, despite the fact that Dr. Hickey neither claimed nor was paid anyexpenses, allowances, compensation or remuneration of any kind at any time.Your Committee are satisfied, therefore, that the office held by Dr. Hickeyconstituted an office of profit as defined by the relevant Statutes, that at thetime of her election to the House of Commons in February, 1949, and ofher re-election in October, 1953, Dr. Hickey held an office of profit underthe Crown and that as a consequence her election was invalid.Your Committee are satisfied that Dr. Hickey acted in all good faith and without any knowledge of the legal complexities involved, and that at no time did she apply for or receive any remuneration or expenses of any kind whatsoever.Sir William McCleeryThe case of Sir William McCleery is rather complicated and requires a somewhat fuller explanation than that of Dr. Hickey.It starts with a Statute of the United Kingdom Parliament, The Reinstate-ment in Civil Employment Act, 1944. That Act gives certain persons rightsof reinstatement in former employment on release from War Service, andif any person considered that his rights were being denied to him he couldapply to a Reinstatement Committee. If aggrieved by the determination ofthe Reinstatement Committee he had the further right of appeal to anUmpire and the Umpire was required to sit with two Assessors appointed bythe Minister of Labour and National Service in the United Kingdom Govern-ment.The National Service Act, 1948, consolidated the National Service Acts1939-1947 and the Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act, 1944, so faras the latter Act applies to persons called up for National Service after 31stDecember, 1948. The continuing application of the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944, is limited by Section 59 of the National service act, 1948, and provision with regard to Assessors is made in Sections 43, 49,and 59 of this Act. Sections 43 and 59 provide that after the passing ofthe Act of 1948 any Assessor appointed under the Act of 1944 shall bedeemed to have been appointed under Section 43 of the Act of 1948. NoAssessor shall be appointed under Section 10 of the Act of 1944 and any reference in Section 10 of the Act of 1944 shall be construed as a referenceto an Assessor appointed or deemed to be appointed under Section 43 ofthe Act of 1948. The 1948 Act provides that the Minister of Labour maypay to persons appointed to sit as Assessors &quot;such remuneration and allow-ances as the Minister may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine.&quot;On 28th July, 1944, an arrangement under Section 63 of the Governmentof Ireland Act, 1920, was made between the United Kingdom Minister ofLabour and the Ministry of Labour for Northern Ireland for the exerciseof the powers and duties under the Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act,1944, by officers of the Ministry of Labour for Northern Ireland on behalfof the United Kingdom Minister. The agreement provided that in NorthernIreland the powers and duties of the United Kingdom Minister should beexercised and performed by the Permanent Secretary or by an assistant secretary of the Ministry of Labour for Northern Ireland.Under this arrangement, Sir William McCleery, who had been nominated by the Association of Northern Ireland Chambers of Commerce, was appointed
on the 14th November, 1944, as an Assessor for the purpose of the Reinstate-ment Act of 1944.He was appointed by a minute dated 14th November, 1944, signed by Mr. H. Anderson, then an Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of labour for Northern Ireland.If Sir William McCleery had acted as Assessor he would have been entitled to a fee of two guineas a sitting, subject to a limit of  21 per week,and travelling expenses. We are satisfied that Sir William never acted asAssessor and neither claimed nor received either remuneration by way of fees or otherwise, or expenses.Your Committee are satisfied, on the advice of the Attorney-General,that Sir William McCleery held an office, and held it under the Crown,since Mr. Anderson, in making the appointment, did so on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Minister, and as Sir William McCleery would have been entitled to receive fees if he had acted, your Committee are satisfied thatit was an office of profit.Your Committee are satisfied, therefore, that when Sir William McCleerywas elected to the House of Commons in 1945 and when he was re-electedin 1949 and 1953, he held an office of profit under the Crown and that his election was consequently invalid.Your Committee are, however, satisfied also that Sir William McCleeryacted in all good faith and without any knowledge of the legal complexitiesinvolved.Sir Norman StrongeYour Committee find that Sir Norman Stronge accepted appointmenton the 14th June, 1947, at the request of the then Minister of Labour and national Insurance as Chairman of the Central Advisory Council for theEmployment of the Disabled under the Disabled Persons (Employment)Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, and he continued in this appointment until he resigned on the 16th January, 1956, on receipt of a letter from the PrimeMinister informing him that he may have been disqualified from sitting and voting in the House of Commons owing to the fact that the chairmanship of. this Committee might be considered as an office of profit under the Crown.Sir Norman Stronge was first elected to the House of Commons on 29thSeptember, 1938, and was last re-elected in October, 1953.The Attorney-General informed your Committee that he would feelconstrained by the authority of the precedents established in similar cases to advise that if Sir Norman Stronge was appointed Chairman of the central advisory Council for the Employment of the Disabled so that the emolumentsattached to the appointment under paragraph 4 of the Second Schedule of theAct became payable, then, notwithstanding the fact that no such emolumentswere ever paid to Sir Norman Stronge the appointment was in his opinionan office of profit under the Crown within Section 24 of the 1707 Act.Your Committee, having carefully considered the evidence of Sir NormanStronge and the other witnesses called, including that of the Attorney-General,are satisfied that Sir Norman Stronge was appointed and acted as Chairmanof the Central Advisory Council and that during this period he was a Memberof the House of Commons.Your Committee are also satisfied, in view of the advice of the Attorney-General, that this office constitutes an office of profit under the Crown withinthe meaning of the relevant Statutes, and this opinion is reinforced by recent
1JLdecisions at Westminster. Your Committee therefore conclude that at thetime of his last election to the House of Commons, Sir Norman Stronge heldan office of profit under the Crown and as a consequence his election wasinvalid.Your Committee are satisfied that Sir Norman Stronge acted in all good faith and without any knowledge of the legal complexities involved, and that at no time did he apply for or receive any remuneration or expenses of any kind whatsoever during the period he was chairman and that when thequestion of his possible disqualification was brought to his attention in aletter from the Prime Minister he immediately resigned not only the Chair -manship of the Advisory Council but also the Speakership of the House ofCommons.Your Committee therefore recommend that representations should be made immediately to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce the necessary legis-lation to indemnify Sir Norman Stronge, Sir William McCleery and Dr. EileenHickey and to validate their election.
MINUTES OF EVIDENCEFIRST DAYTUESDAY, 31st JANUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Tuesday, 31st January, 1956.There were present: Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Hawthorne, Captain Henderson,Mr. Irwin, Mr. J. W. Morgan, Mr. W. J. Morgan, and Mr. McConnell.The Attorney-General (Mr. Edmond Warnock, Q.C.); Major J. W.McConnell, C.B.E., Secretary, and Mr. H. Anderson, Assistant Secretary,Ministry of Labour and National Insurance ; and Mr. R. Eagleson, Secretaryto the National Assistance Board w ere in attendance.The Secretary (Major George Thomson):The first business of the Committee is toelect a Chairman.Mr. Faulkner: I propose that Mr.McConnell be the Chairman. He is theonly lawyer among us, and it would be very good to have such a person in the Chair.Mr. J. W. Morgan: I would second that proposal.The Secretary: Is that agreeable?The Committee indicated assent, and Mr.McConnell took the Chair.The Chairman: Mr. Attorney-General,we should thank you for coming to assist us this morning. You have looked into thismatter, and we should be very muchobliged if you would outline the facts tous as you have found them.The Attorney-General: I have prepared a memorandum, which I dictated last night,and I think it might help the Members ofthe Committee in following what I am goingto say if I gave each Member a copy of it.In some respects it is rather involved, andI think the Members would follow it muchmore easily if they had the typescript beforethem. (Copies handed to Members.) If Imay I shall just read it, and perhaps makea few interpolations.The Chairman: I think that would bebetter.The Attorney-General: As this is thefirst occasion upon which a Select Com-mittee of our House of Commons has been called upon to consider any question ofdisqualification, and as few of us had, untilvery recently, any exact knowledge of thesubject, perhaps it would assist the Com-mittee if I were to make a general state-ment.The Succession to the Crown Act, 1707,provided, inter alia, that any person holdingan office of profit under the Crown is in-capable of being elected or of sitting orvoting as a Member of the House ofCommons. The penalty for sitting and voting in breach of the Act of 1707 is thesum of  500, which can be recovered by aCommon Informer.By Section 18(2) of the Government ofIreland Act, 1920, it is declared that thelaw for the time being in force relating tothe qualification and disqualification of theMembers of the Commons House of Parlia-ment of the United Kingdom shall, save asotherwise provided by the Act, apply to members of the House of Commons ofNorthern Ireland.There are a number of other Statutesdealing with the subject, but I do not propose to trouble the Committee withthem, certainly not at this stage. As I see it, the Act of 1707 must be our guide.The effect of the Statutory enactmentsis, I think, that any person who holds an office of profit under the Crown is dis-qualified from membership of the commons of Northern Ireland. Your primary task isto consider whether Sir Norman Stronge,Sir William McCleery and Dr. EileenHickey, or any of them, held such an office.When questions of this nature have arisenat Westminster in recent years it has beenthe usual, but not the invariable, practice toappoint a Select Committee of the house to consider and report. These problemsdo not ordinarily come before the courts of law. It is possible that they could do so,if a Common Informer sued for penalties,but i am not aware of any such case. the precedents to which we must look for guidance are to be found in the records ofthe proceedings of these Select Com-mittees, their recommendations, and the subsequent actions of Parliament itself. iwould advise this Select Committee to regard such precedents as authoritative,and, in reaching conclusions, to be guided by them. At Westminster it has beencustomary for the Law Officers to attend the Committee and to try to assist, and Tam here to-day in compliance with this practice.May I take first the case of Sir NormanStronge. In 1945 our Parliament passed the disabled Persons (Employment) Act tomake better provision for enabling personshandicapped by disablement to secure em-ployment, and by Section 17 the Ministry
of Labour was required to establish a central advisory council charged with theduty of advising and assisting the ministry in matters relating to the employment ofdisabled persons generally. In June, 1947,Sir Norman accepted the position of Chair-man of this advisory council, being appointed thereto by the Minister orLabour.The Statute (by the Second Schedule)authorises the payment, out of moneys pro-vided by Parliament, to the members ofthe Council, of &quot;such travelling and other allowances, including compensation for lossof remunerative time&quot; 1 would draw theattention of the Committee to those words as the Ministry, with the approval of theMinistry of Finance, might determine.I understand that you will have before you a copy of a memorandum issued bythe Ministry of Labour for the informationof members of local tribunals, and ofmembers of committees under the disabled persons Act, The opening paragraph reads:&quot;Service on the bodies referred to isregarded as voluntary and unpaid&quot;. I am informed by the Ministry of Labour and you will have evidence to this effect that sir Norman has never at any time asked for or received any payment whatever, whetherby way of expenses, allowances, compen-sation or otherwise in respect of his services on this advisory council.I think that on the authority of the cases to which I will refer later the Committeeshould conclude that Sir Norman held an office and held it under the Crown, but inthe circumstances you may be puzzled toknow how it could be described as an officeof profit. 1 think it can be confidentlystated that the actual receipt of remunera-tion is not necessary to constitute an officeone of profit. This would appear to beestablished by some very recent casesconsidered by Select Committees at West-minster. The two cases to which I am about to refer are not only the most recent cases they were actually considered in Novem-ber and December last year but they alsoappear to me to be very relevant.On 1st December, 1954, Mr. Howell, notat that date a Member of Parliament, wasappointed to two panels from which are drawn the employees&apos; representatives to sit on local tribunals under the national insurance and National Insurance (industrial injuries) Acts. He was not appointed to the tribunals, but to the panels only. He con-tinued to hold these appointments untilAugust, 1955, by which time he had beenelected a Member of the House of Com-mons. I think he came in at a by-election.Mr. Howell never sat on a tribunal. Hewas summoned once, but did not attend.The letter appointing him to the panelsexpressly stated that no fees were payable,but that expenses on a certain scale were allowed. It is provided, however, in the statutes themselves that members of tri-tribunals may be paid such remuneration andsuch travelling and other allowances as theMinister may, with the concurrence of theTreasury, determine.The Select Committee came to the con-clusion, after hearing evidence, including that of the Attorney-General, that sinceunder the Statutes remuneration could bepaid if the Minister and the Treasury so determined, Mr. HowelPs appointmentswere to offices of profit.The case of Mr. Charles Beatlie wasconsidered in December last. Mr. Beattieheld similar appointments under the twocorresponding Northern Ireland Statutes,National Insurance and National Insurance(Industrial Injuries) Acts, and following itsown conclusion in Mr. HowelPs case, theCommittee held that Mr. Beattie&apos;s appoint-ments were offices of profit.Mr. Beattie also held an appointmentunder the National Assistance Act, and inthis case he was entitled to allowances,including compensation for loss of re-remunerative time. The words are very similar to those which applied to SirNorman Stronge&apos;s appointment. The reporton Mr. Beattie&apos;s case states that after con-sideration the Attorney-General expressedthe opinion that so far as Mr. Beattie was concerned those words made his office oneof profit.Sir Donald Somervell, when Attorney-General in 1941, giving evidence before theHerbert Committee which was a Com-mittee which sat to consider these questionsof disqualifications-stated the principle which appears to have been accepted. Hesaid:The principle that has been adopted isthat if emoluments have ever beenattached to the office the fact that emolu-ments are not received by the particularholder is irrelevant.And in Mr. Beattie&apos;s case the presentAttorney-General (Sir Reginald Manning-ham-Buller) said that where an appointmentof any kind was governed by a Statuteit was the terms of the Statute and not theterms of any letter of appointment there-under that had to be construed in deciding whether the appointment was an office of profit or not.If the facts in the case of Sir NormanStronge are as I have stated, I feel con-strained by the authority of these pre-cedents to advise the Committee that SirNorman held an office, that he held it underthe Crown, and that it was an office of profit.I need hardly add that if the evidence which you receive varies or contradicts thatupon which 1 have based my opinion Iwould wish to have an opportunity toconsider whether it would lead me to altermy view. I am speaking now, of course,from information given to me, at my re-quest, by the various Ministries, and thesame observation applies to the cases ofSir William McCleery and Dr. Hickey.
Sir William McCleery&apos;s case is a littlemore complicated. It starts with a statute of the United Kingdom Parliament,, the reinstatement in Civil Employment Act,1944. That Act gives certain persons rightsof reinstatement in former employment onrelease from war service, and if any personconsidered that his rights were being denied to him, he could apply to a reinstatementcommittee. If aggrieved by the determina-tion of the reinstatement committee he hadthe further right of appeal to an umpireand the umpire was required to sit with two assessors appointed by the Minister ofLabour and National Service in the UnitedKingdom Government. The next paragraphis to bring the matter up to date.The National Service Act, 1948., con-solidated the earlier National Service Acts,1939-1947, and the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944, so far as the latterAct applies to persons called up for national Service after 31st December, 1948.The continuing application of the Reinstate-ment in Civil Employment Act, 1944, is limited by Section 59 of the NationalService Act, 1948, and provision with regardto assessors is made in Sections 43, 49 and59 of this Act. Sections 43 and 59 provide that after the passing of the Act of 1948 anyassessor appointed under the Act of 1944shall be deemed to have been appointed under Section 43 of the Act of 1948. Noassessor shall be appointed under Section 10of the Act of 1944 and any reference inSection 10 of the Act of 1944 shall be con-strued as a reference to an assessorappointed or deemed to be appointed underSection 43 of the Act of 1948. The 1948Act provides that the Minister of Labourmay pay to persons appointed to sit asassessors &quot;Such remuneration and allow-ances as the Minister may with theapproval of the Treasury determine.&quot; Ithink that paragraph is factually correct; Ithink it is a correct summary of thestatutory position.Up to this point we are dealing with theUnited Kingdom Statutes and the UnitedKingdom Minister of Labour.On 28th July, 1944, an arrangement under Section 63 of the Government ofIreland Act, 1920, was made between theUnited Kingdom Minister of Labour andthe Ministry of Labour for Northern Ire:land for the exercise of the powers and duties under the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944, by officers of theMinistry of Labour for Northern Ireland and mark these words on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Minister. The agreement provided that in Northern Ireland thepowers and duties of the United kingdom minister should be exercised and performed by the Permanent Secretary or by an assistant Secretary of the Ministry ofLabour for Northern Ireland.Under this arrangement Sir WilliamMcCleery, who had been nominated by theAssociation of Northern Ireland chambers of Commerce, was appointed on the 14thNovember, 1944, as an assessor for thepurpose of the Reinstatement Act of 1944.He was appointed by a minute dated 14thNovember, 1944, signed by Mr. H.Anderson, then an Assistant Secretary tothe Ministry of Labour for NorthernIreland.If he had acted as assessor he would havebeen entitled to a fee of two guineas asitting, subject to a limit of  21 per week,and travelling expenses. I am informed that sir William never acted as assessor and neither claimed nor received either re-muneration by way of fees or otherwise,or expenses. That is not, perhaps, textuallycorrect but it conveys the substance.It would appear that Sir William held an office, and held it under the Crown, since mr. Anderson in making the appointmentdid so on behalf of the United kingdom minister, and since he was entitled toreceive fees I think it must follow, from the precedents, that it was an office of profit.Dr. Hickey&apos;s membership Of an advisorycommittee for the Belfast area in connec-tion with the National Assistance Boardrequires some explanation. Section 30 of theUnemployment Act (Northern Ireland),1934, established an Unemployment Assist-ance Board. That was the first of the Assist-ance Boards. It was renamed the assistance board for Northern Ireland by the Old age and Widows Pension Act (Northern Ireland),1940, and later renamed the national assistance Board for Northern Ireland bythe National Assistance Act, 1948.Under the 1934 Act the Board was re-quired to arrange for the establishment of advisory committees for such areas as theBoard thought fit, and Section 30 providedthat the Board might pay to members of advisory committees &quot;Such travelling aridother allowances (including compensationfor loss of remunerative time)&quot; as theBoard, after consultation with the Ministerof Labour and with the consent of theMinistry of Finance, might determine.The Act of 1934 was repealed by theNational Assistance Act (Northern Ireland),1948, but Section 3 of the 1948 Act providesthat the National Assistance Board mayarrange for the establishment of advisorycommittees -it is a re-enactment really for such areas as the Board may think fitand further that the Board shall pay to members of advisory committees suchtravelling and other allowances, includingcompensation for loss of remunerativetime, as the Board may determine. And itwas further provided that advisory cora-mittees appointed under the 1934 Actshould, unless and until the Board other-wise determined, be deemed to be advisorycommittees established under Section 3 ofthe National Assistance Act, 1948.Dr. Eileen Hickey was appointed a mem-ber of the advisory committee in September,1945. She was invited to undertake this duty in a letter from Mr. Thomas Elwood,an officer of the Board, and she acceptedthe invitation by letter dated 10th Septem-
ber, 1945. In November, 1955, the chairmanof the Board was considering the reappoint-ment of the advisory committees and on28th November, 1955, he invited Dr.Hickey to continue to act. On 1st Decem-ber, 1955, Dr. Hickey agreed to do so.It will be noted that Dr. Hickey&apos;s firstappointment in 1945 resulted from corres-pondence between herself and Mr. ThomasElwood, then an officer of the assistance board, and that her appointment inDecember, 1955, resulted from the letterspassing between herself and the Chairmanof the Board.Both the Act of 1934 and the Act of1948 contain the following provision:The functions of the Board, and of theOfficers and servants appointed by theBoard, shall be exercised on behalf ofthe Crown.If Dr. Hickey had merely beenappointed on Mr. Thomas Eiwood&apos;sadministrative act it might have been saidthat she did not hold an office under theCrown, but both the Acts of 1934 and 1948provide that the functions of the Boardand of the officers concerned shall beexercised on behalf of the Crown.In these circumstances it would appearthat in respect of her first, and subsequentappointments to the advisory committee,Dr. Hickey held an office, and held it under the Crown, and the provision in both Statutes for payment of travelling and other allowances, including compensa-tion for loss of remunerative time, wouldseem to bring her case within the principlesestablished by the Howell and Beattie cases,despite the fact that Dr. Hickey neitherclaimed nor was paid any expenses,allowances, compensation or remuneration of any kind at any time.I have tried to summarise what I am informed are the salient facts in these threecases.The Chairman: Are there any questions that any Members of the Committee wouldlike to ask the Attorney-General.Mr. Faulkner: It seems quite clear fromthe statement of the Attorney-General thatthere are three points that we have todetermine in relation to disqualification:firstly, whether the Member concerned heldan office ; secondly, whether it was an officeof profit; and, thirdly, whether it was underthe Crown. The Attorney-General has told us quite clearly that each of the three members concerned held offices of that kind.Unless we receive any evidence to the con-trary in the course of our examination, wemust be guided by what the Attorney-General has told us. The question I want to ask now is, if we are satisfied ineach case that they are disqualified persons,then, firstly, what action does the Attorney-General recommend us to take as a Com-mittee to indemnify them ; and, secondly,am I right in assuming that having indemnity-nified them there is nothing we can do aboutvalidating them, if that is the correct word ;that we nave got to pass on our views as aCommittee to Westminster? If so, I want toask the Attorney-General for advice as to how we do that. To whom do we send ou;rviews? The third thing 1 should like to askis this. Perhaps I am going a little bit toofast and making too many points, but I amtrying to get them all in at once. It seemsquite clear from all this that the law is ina very difficult state in relation to thisquestion of qualification and disqualificationso can the Attorney-General tell us whether as a Select Committee we are entitled tomake any recommendations for the future-or perhaps you can help us on this, Mr.Chairman to prevent something of thiskind happening again.The Attorney-General: I should like to enlarge, if I may, for a moment. Mi-,Faulkner has said that the law is in a verydifficult state. You will readily believe thatI have looked into this matter with somecare, and the law is in a state of remarkablecomplexity indeed. I am just going to give you three examples of very long standingconfusion. Away back in 1873, when Mr.Gladstone was First Lord of the Treasury,he assumed the office of Chancellor of theExchequer. There was great debate whetherit was necessary for him at that timeto seek re-election. Two of the law officers,Coleridge and Jessel, took the view thatre-election was not necessary, while LordSelborne, the then Lord Chancellor, andthe Lord Advocate for Scotland were equally positive the other way. Coleridgeand Jessel went to the Bench, two new lawofficers were appointed, and the case was sent to the two new law officers who gave the illuminating opinion that there were very weighty arguments in favour of re-election and equally weighty views the other way. That is as far as they went.In 1909 the United Kingdom Parliamentcreated the office of President of the Boardof Trade. In 1932 it was discovered that every President of the Board of Trade whohad held office from 1909 until 1932 wasdisqualified, and Sir John Simon, in a reference to the matter, said the penaltiesinvolved would be sufficient to pay for thewar. In 1932 the Imperial Parliament hadto pass an Act indemnifying every Presidentof the Board of Trade and validating theirelection, that was, indemnifying every Pres-ident over a period of 23 years. actually in 1915 even the Attorney-General found himself subject to very heavy penaltiesbecause he had been disqualified. I thinkthat is enough to confirm Mr. Faulkner&apos;view that the law is in a very difficult state.He asked if, at the end of the Commit-tee&apos;s deliberations, you are satisfied thatthese three Members or any of them were holding an office of profit under the Crownwhat action the Committee could take.Your duty as the Committee is to report and find as a fact whether in your opinion
the three persons did hold such an office.That report goes to Parliament, and then it is for Parliament to declare, as I thinkour Parliament has power to declare, thatthese people are disqualified. My view would be that the Committee should find the facts. You would find in fact, if it beso, that these three people, or one or otheror all of them, had incurred penalties ondisqualification. It is for this Committeeso to find. So far as the question of valida-tion and indemnity is concerned, in my view and it is the view generally held -our Parliament has power over its ownmembership to this extent, that it can say a Member is disqualified and put him out.I do not think our Parliament has powereither to indemnify or validate, and thatis a matter on which legislation, if itis to come, must come from the UnitedKingdom Parliament. I have not got acopy of your terms of reference . . .Captain Henderson: I was just going tosay that surely what we really want to dois to get back to our terms of reference.The first, as the Attorney-General men-tioned, is finding whether they held office ;secondly, whether they were incapable ofbeing elected; and, thirdly, the question of representations.The Attorney-General: Assuming that youfind on the first point, that one or otheror all of these persons held an office of profit under the Crown, then you wouldhave to report accordingly. If you find inthe first count then the answer to No. 2is necessarily &quot; Yes&quot; and, thirdly, if so,what representations should be made to her majesty&apos;s Government. Having regard tothe fact that these three persons have inthe chaotic and difficult state of the lawincurred penalties of disqualification, andthe penal consequences might be veryserious, I would suggest that as none ofthem ever received a penny and as it hasbeen in the performance of public dutiesthat they have incurred these consequences,the Committee might very properly recom-mend that legislation should be passed at westminster to validate and indemnify them.When I say that I am not suggesting thatany request should be made to Westminsterwhich is not in consonance with whatWestminster has done in its own cases.There have been in recent years eightActs at Westminster validating 12 persons.I have in my memorandum referred to Mr.Howell; his election was validated. In 1955a Mr. Holland-Martin, who had incurreddisqualification under somewhat similar circumstances, had his election validated.Mr. Niall Macpherson, who had incurreddisqualification because he held office as amember of the London Agency of theDried Fruit Board of the Commonwealthof Australia, had his election validated. In1949 two Members of Parliament who hadbeen members of the General MedicalCouncil and who had incurred disqualification-cation,  had  their  elections  validated.   In1946 a Select Committee sat and as aresult of their recommendations the Mem-bers who had been disqualified for Camber-well, Bristol and Nottingham had theirelections validated. In 1945 a Select Com-mittee found that such remuneration asreceived was negligible compared with theexpenses which the Member had incurred.That was the case of the Members forCoatbridge and Springburn. Those werevalidated. So we have since 1945 precedentsof eight Acts in the Imperial Parliamentvalidating the election of 12 persons. Ifthe Committee thought fit at the end oftheir deliberations to make such a recom-mendation I think it would be in consonancewith the practice at Westminster.The Secretary: It would have to be a recommendation to our House, or to our government, to make representations to theImperial Parliament. There is the differencehereThe Attorney-General: It would be a recommendation from this Committee toour House that our Government shouldmake representations to Westminster. DidI miss anything, Mr. Faulkner?Mr. Faulkner: You have covered allthe points I mentioned. There is a point that is puzzling me in regard to themachinery in making representations to her majesty&apos;s Government in this matter, whichis something which, according to our termsof reference, we are required to do. I want to know the machinery.The Secretary: Subject to correction bythe Attorney-General, the procedure wouldbe that this Committee would have to makea Report to the House asking the house to make representations to our Government.I say that because it is the Government thatmake representations to the ImperialGovernment. The House would have to instruct our Government to make represen-tations in view of the Report of the SelectCommittee.The Attorney-General: Is this not themachinery? The Committee report to ourHouse and the House presumably it is at liberty to reject your Report will deal with it. The question which is passing throughyour mind Mr. Faulkner, is one which willbecome apt for consideration when draftingyour Report. You report to our House, andthen it will be for the Government if theyact on your Report, to make representations.Mr. J. W. Morgan: Does the Memoran-dum issued by the Ministry of Labour and national Insurance in the case of SirNorman Stronge it refers to voluntary andunpaid services apply to the three cases?The Attorney-General: I cannot answeryour question, Mr. Morgan, because i cannot put that document into Sir NormanStronge&apos;s hands; I have a copy of it here.The Secretary: Each member of theCommittee has a copy of it.
The Attorney-General: That is a docu-ment sent out by the Ministry of Labourand National Insurance to all members whenthey are appointed to these committees. Iunderstand that it is sent out as a matter of form to each member. If a person is appointed-ted to a committee the Ministry send him a copy of the document. In fact, it istextually similar to the document which theBritish Ministry of Labour issue in similar circumstances. Although I cannot put myfinger on the place, I rather think an exactlysimilar document was in existence in Mr.HowelFs case when it was before the BritishSelect Committee. I cannot put that docu-ment into Sir Norman Stronge&apos;s hands orinto the hands of Sir William McCleery orDr. Hickey. I cannot say that they receivedit, but it is customary for the Ministry tosend it out.The Secretary: They will be able to give evidence in regard to it.The Chairman: We will have the wit-nesses from the Ministry of Labour and national Insurance.The Secretary: In the case of Dr. Hickeya representative from the National Assist-ance Board will appear before the Com-mittee.Mr. J. W. Morgan: That is vital. It isstated in the document that their services were voluntary and unpaid.The Attorney General: That is so. What-ever may have been in that document eachof these three persons did in fact considerthat it was voluntary and unpaid and theynever asked for or received any money.They all come with completely cleanhands.Captain Henderson: It was possible forthem to get it.The Attorney-General: Yes.Captain Henderson: Should we then not go ahead with the first part of our terms ofreference and find whether they held these offices? These documents are not sufficient evidence, or are they?The Chairman: We shall hear the repre-sentatives of the Ministry of Labour and national Insurance, and also the three members concerned.The Attorney-General: Captain Hender-son, I really cannot give evidence. I have tried to give you a general summary whichwould indicate the sort of evidence youwant. I cannot give the evidence because Ihave no personal knowledge. That docu-ment is provided by the Ministry of Labourand National Insurance and I have sum-marised it. So far as facts are concerned,I am not in a position to give evidence inregard to any of them.The Chairman: Is there anything elseany Member of the Committee wishes toask the Attorney-General? I am sure if we require your assistance at a later stage, Mr.Attorney-General, you will be only too glad to assist the Committee.The Attorney-General: Certainly. I havekept this week fairly free knowing that theCommittee was going to sit. Even at short notice I will be able to appear if the Com-mittee feel I can help them further.The Chairman: I should like to thankyou for your assistance.The Attorney-General: Thank you verymuch. Good morning, gentlemen.The Attorney-General then withdrew.Major McConnell, Mr. Anderson andMr. Eagleson called.The Chairman: If we deal first with SirNorman Stronge perhaps the Ministry ofLabour could help us with the details ofthe appointment.Major McConnell: We have submittedto the Committee a memorandum withsome attachments, and, if the Committeelike, Mr. Anderson will cover the groundon that, if it is necessary to read it.The Chairman: I think it should be onthe record.The following memorandum by theMinistry of Labour and National Insurancewas read by Mr. Anderson :Under Section 17 of the disabled persons (Employment) Act (NorthernIreland), 1945, it is the duty of the Minis-try to establish a central advisory councilto advise and assist it in matters relatingto the employment, undertaking of workon their own account or training, ofdisabled persons generally. The second schedule to the Act authorises the pay-ment by the Ministry out of moneys provided by Parliament to the membersof the council of &quot;such travelling andother allowances, including compensationfor loss of remunerative time,&quot; as theMinistry, with the approval of the Ministryof Finance, may determine. Particulars ofthe current rates of expenses and allow-ances so approved and determined, and theconditions subject to which they are pay-side, are attached.The first Chairman (Lord MacDermott)of the Central Advisory Council for theEmployment of the Disabled, set up under the Act, resigned in 1947, and theMinister of Labour, by letter dated 12thJune, 1947, invited Sir Norman Stronge,Bart., M.C., H.M.L., to succeed him.Sir Norman Stronge accepted the appoint-rhent in a letter dated 14th June, 1947.The Minister received a letter of re-signation from membership of theCouncil from Sir Norman Stronge on16th January, 1956. This was accepted bythe Minister in a letter dated 17thJanuary, 1956. Copies of the lettersrelating to Sir Norman Stronge&apos;s appoint-ment and resignation are attached.Sir Norman never claimed or was paidany remuneration, allowances or expenses in respect of his appointment as chairmanof the council.
The Chairman: Is there any question that any member of the Committee wishes to ask Mr. Anderson about Sir NormanStronge&apos;s case?Mr. J. W. Morgan: When Sir NormanStronge was appointed did he receive amemorandum from the Ministry of Labourand National Insurance stating that his services would be regarded as voluntary andunpaid?Mr. Anderson: He got a letter from theMinister. I do not think there is any re-ference in that letter to payment. Theletter is attached to the memorandum.Mr. W. J. Morgan: Was there anything that would convey to Sir Norman that itwould be a paid post?Mr. Anderson: No.The Chairman: 1 think perhaps what Mr.J. W. Morgan had in mind was that in thememorandum that you read it is statedthat the particulars of the current rates of expenses and allowances so approved and determined, and the conditions subject towhich they are payable, are attached. Thereis an attached sheet showing these matters.What Mr. J. W. Morgan had in mind wasthat sheet which is attached to the memor-andum sent to Sir Norman Stronge?Mr. Anderson: I cannot tell you whetheror not Sir Norman got a copy of that. Thememorandum states:Service on the bodies referred to above is regarded as voluntary and unpaid, andany allowances that may be payable inrespect of attendance at meetings, whether on account of travelling, subsistence or compensation for loss of earnings, are intended only to reimburse to membersamounts actually and necessarily ex-pended or lost, and are in no sense a payment for services rendered.That was the Ministry&apos;s view until doubt was cast on it very recently.The Chairman: I take it that it iscustomary to send oy.t that intimation to people appointed?Mr. Anderson: Thut may or may nothave been done. Quite possibly it was not done in Sir Norman&apos;s case.Major McConnelT. The purpose of thismemorandum is for circulation to membersof committees for their information. Wecannot say whether a copy of this memo-randum was included.Captain Henderson: In point of fact,had Sir Norman claimed those expenses hewould have been paid?Mr. Anderson: If you look at the memo-randum you will see that he could havebeen paid travelling and subsistence allow-ances in certain conditions, but I gather thatthe matter really of interest to the Commit-tee is the provision in the Act in respect of payment of compensation for loss of renumerative time. If you look at the memo-randum you will see that the actual provis-ion made for payment of compensation for loss of remunerative time is very limitedindeed. First of all, compensation for actualloss of earnings up to a maximum of 30sa day (in addition to subsistence when due)is payable to workmen representatives whoare working men following their trades.Obviously Sir Norman does not come into that category and would have no title to bepaid there. Then employer or workmen re-presentatives who, although in business ontheir own account, actually work at their trade in the same or similar way as though they were journeymen working for wages for at least three-quarters of the recognisednumber of normal working hours a week in that occupation may, if their attendance at a meeting has involved them in loss of renumerative time, receive an allowanceat a rate not exceeding the rate of wagespayable in the district to workmen of thesame trade up to a maximum of 30s. aday in addition to subsistence when due.Where the performance of remunerativework is merely advanced or deferred, no compensation is payable.Captain Henderson: That is for actualcompensation, but if he had claimed actualexpenses the Ministry would have paidhim?Mr. A nderson: Oh yes, he could haveclaimed them.Mr. Faulkner: Is the information whichis given to people by the Ministry of Labourwhen they accept these appointments ex-actly the same as the information coming from the Ministry of Labour and NationalService in Great Britain? Are the lettersof appointment couched in the same terms?Mr. Anderson:  Not necessarily.Mr. Faulkner: Not necessarily?Mr. Anderson: No. Sir Norman&apos;s appoint-ment here was by a letter from Mr.Maginess, who was the Minister at thattime.Mr. Faulkner: But when this Memoran-dum is issued does it follow a British pat-tern?Mr. Anderson: Very largely, yes. As amatter of fact, the limits of our compen-sation may not be quite the same, but byand large our provision is the same.Mr. J. W. Morgan: I would like to askMr. Anderson a question. In the Britishcase, where a Member of Parliament orany person acts on one of those commit-tees does he receive a memorandum similarto the one issued by, say, the Ministry ofLabour here, where it states definitely thatthe position is to be regarded as voluntary and unpaid? Is that in the British memor-andum?Mr. A nderson: That I could not tell you.Major McConnell: On that point perhaps i could remind the members of the Cpm-mittee that there was a case in the BritishHouse of Commons which led to somepronouncement by, I think, the Attorney-General there, that it was not a question of
1^3what was in any official document but ratherwhat were the statutory provisions, so that point must have been present in his mind.Mr. Faulkner: Quite.The Chairman: Is there anything elseas regards Sir Norman Stronge? If not,perhaps we could pass on to Sir WilliamMcCleery now. Mr. Anderson, would youadopt the same procedure and read thememorandum?The following Memorandum was read byMr. Anderson:The Reinstatement in Civil Employ-ment Act, 1944, passed by the Parlia-ment of the United Kingdom, givescertain rights of reinstatement in their former employment to persons released from war service. The Act provides thata person who claims to have rights under it which are being or have been denied to him may apply to a reinstatementcommittee for the determination of anyquestion relating to his rights, andmakes further provision for an appealto an umpire or deputy umpire from anydetermination or order of a reinstatementcommittee or from the refusal of a com-mittee to make an order. When consider-ing such an appeal Section 10 of the Actrequires the umpire or deputy umpire to sit with two assessors appointed by theMinister of Labour and National Service,and Section 19 provides for the paymentout of moneys provided by Parliamentto assessors so appointed of such re-muneration and allowances as the Minis-ter may, with the approval of theTreasury, determine.The National Service Act, 1948, which came into operation on the 1st January,1949, consolidated the National service acts, 1939 to 1947, and the Reinstate-ment in Civil Employment Act, 1944, sofar as the latter Act applies to personscalled up for National Service after the31st December, 1948. The continuingapplication of the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944, is limited bySection 59 of the National Service Act,1948, and provision with regard toassessors is made in Sections 43. 49 and59 of the latter Act. Sections 43 and 59provide that after the passing of the act of 1948 any assessor appointed underSection 10 of the Act of 1944 shall bedeemed to have been appointed underSection 43 of the Act of 1948; no assessorshall be appointed under Section 10 ofthe Act of 1944; and any reference inSection 10 of the Act of 1944 to anassessor shall be construed as a referenceto an assessor appointed or deemed tohave been appointed under Section 43 ofthe Act of 1948. Section 49 of the 1948Act provides that the Minister of Labourand National Service may pay:. (a)  among others to persons appointedto sit as assessors and to any officersand servants of the Minister employed for the purposes of the foregoing pro- -&apos;visions of this Part of this Act, such remuneration and allowances as theMinister may, with the approval ofthe Treasury, determine.On the 28th July, 1944, an arrange-ment under Section 63 of the Governmentof Ireland Act, 1920, was made betweenthe Minister of Labour and NationalService and the Ministry of Labour for northern Ireland for the exercise and performance of powers and duties underthe Reinstatement in Civil EmploymentAct, by officers of the Ministry on behalfof the Minister. It was agreed that inNorthern Ireland the powers and dutiesof the Minister under the Act in so faras they relate to Northern Ireland except the power to make Orders or Regulations shall be exercised and performed bythe Permanent Secretary or any assistant secretary to the Ministry, or by thePrincipal Officer in charge of reinstate-ment in Northern Ireland. A copy ofthe Memorandum of Arrangement underSection 63 of the Government of ireland act is attached.Under this arrangement Sir William V.McCleery, D.L., J.P..-then Mr. W. V.McCleery who had been nominated bythe Association of Northern IrelandChambers of Commerce, was appointed as an assessor for the purpose of Section10 of the Reinstatement in Civil Employ-ment Act, 1944, on the 14th November,1944, but he never acted as an assessorfor the purpose of that Act or of theNational Service Act, 1948. Copies of the correspondence on the subject of hisnomination which passed between theMinistry and the Association of NorthernIreland Chambers of Commerce are attached.Sir William McCleery tendered his re-signation of his appointment as anassessor in a letter dated the 7thDecember, 1955, and acceptance of itwas notified to him by the Ministry onthe 9th December. 1955. Copies of the minute of appointment of Sir WilliamMcCleery and of his letter of resignationand the Ministry&apos;s reply to it are attached, together with a copy of a lettersent to him by the Ministry on the 14thNovember, 1944, which sets out the fees and expenses payable to assessors at thetime of his appointment.Sir William McCleery never claimedor was paid any remuneration, allow-ances or expenses in respect of his appointment as an assessor.The Chairman: The appointment was actually made under the seal of the Minis-try?Mr. Anderson: No, it was not theMinistry. The position was that this was an Act passed by the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom-it is a Reserved Service,really and the duty of administering it therefore rested on the Minister of Labour
and National Service on the other side. he made the arrangement for the performance of duties here not by the Ministry in terms,but by officers of the Ministry. As 1 said,the Ministers powers and duties underthe Act could be performed by the Per-manent Secretary or any Assistant Secretaryto the Ministry, or by the Principal officer in charge of reinstatement in NorthernIreland. It was not the Ministry, really, thatwas acting in the appointment; as a matterof fact, it was I myself who signed the minute of appointment of Sir WilliamMcCleery, and I was acting as an agentunder the arrangement for the Minister onthe other side.The Chairman: The actual appointment was not made merely by correspondence?There was a minute of appointment?Mr. Anderson: Oh yes. I have put in acopy of both the arrangement empoweringme to act for the Minister and of theactual minute by which I appointed sir william.Mr. Faulkner: Does it contain sir william&apos;s name in that respect?Mr. Anderson: Yes. There was notmerely a letter of appointment; it was inthe minute.Mr. J. W. Morgan: I should just like toask Mr. Anderson if the Government ofIreland Act, 1920, is the foundation ofthese cases. Is that their basis?Mr: Anderson: No. The basis we are dealing with is the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944. That, as I have explained, was an Imperial Act. It was notthe responsibility of this Government to administer it; it was the responsibility ofthe Minister of Labour and National Ser-vice in Great Britain.Mr. .J. W. Morgan: I am thinking of the Ireland Act, 1950.Mr. Anderson: The 1920 Act providedthat agency arrangements could be madeby the Department on the other side sothat their duties and powers in NorthernIreland would be carried out and exercised by the officers of the Ministry here. Theprovisions of the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944, were without preju-dice to the right of the Minister over thereto make an arrangement, under the Govern-ment of Ireland Act, with us to act as agents.Mr. J. W. Morgan: It might confound thewhole issue even more, because the Gov-ernment of Ireland Act, 1920, was an ar-rangement between the Governments ofNorthern Ireland, the Irish Free State andGreat Britain, and then the Irish FreeState dropped out of it and formed anotherconstitution.The Chairman: I think the crucial matter is that this was an Imperial Statute andthat that part of it which was applicableto Northern Ireland is still applicable andthat we must regard it as an ImperialStatute applicable to Northern Ireland.mr. J. W. Morgan: Then the Ireland act of 1950 does not alter that 1944 appoint-ment of Sir William McCleery?The Chairman: No, it does not affect the1920 Act in any respect which makes any difference to what we are trying at themoment.Mr. Anderson: Section 63 of the Gov-ernment of Ireland Act&apos;, under which thisarrangement was made that we should actas the agents, is fully operative still. Therewere certain amendments made to the 1920Act as a result of the setting up of theIrish Free State which were not contem-plated at the time the 1920 Act was passed.The 1920 Act was certainly amended butthat did not affect Section 63, which con-tinues in force.Mr. Faulkner: This case seems to be soanalogous to that of Sir Norman Strongethat I do not think there is any need to askfurther questions.Captain Henderson: I have a point toraise about the method of appointment ofSir William McCleery. It seems that he wasnominated, or his name was suggested, bythe Association of Chambers of Commerce.There is no copy of a letter from him ac-intercepting the appointment? He had no option but to accept it?Mr. Anderson: The position there isthat we had asked the Association of Cham-bers of Commerce to nominate somebodysuitable for appointment and they had given us Sir WilliarrTs name. I have their letter here:Further to your letter of 8th Septem-ber, I am instructed to inform you thatMr. W. V. McCleery, J.P., of Balnamore,Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, has been nomi-nated as an assessor, and I have for-warded to him the leaflet R.E.L.I. which you sent with your letter.Captain  Henderson:   There  is nothinghere to say that he had agreed to acceptthe appointment, except that the last letterfrom him in this batch of correspondencestates that he begs to resign. If he wasresigning, he had accepted the appointmentin the first place.Mr. Anderson: The Association ofChambers of Commerce had told us thatthey had nominated him and that they had sent him a copy of our leaflet. We assumed that they had done all this with theknowledge of Sir William, or Mr.McCleery as he was at that time.The Chairman: That is as far as you can put it?Mr. Anderson: Yes.The Chairman: Only either Sir Williamor the Association of Chambers ofCommerce could put the matter anyfurther.Mr. J. W. Morgan: Did Sir Williamreceive a memorandum from the ministry to say that his services were considered tobe voluntary and unpaid?
Mr, Anderson: Oh, no. You will findthere a copy of the letter sent him signed bymyself. Having signed the minute of appoint-ment, which remains on the Ministry&apos;s files,we then sent him a letter dated the 14thNovember, 1944. In that we state:. . .1 have to inform you that you havebeen appointed to act as an Assessor forthe purposes of the Act.Fees and expenses will be payable toyou as follows on any occasion on which you are called on to act as an Assessor:Here is set out what will be payable: Fees Two guineas per sitting (half-day) with amaximum of four guineas per day, subjectto a limit of  21 a week. Expenses Travelling expenses actually and necessarilyincurred, and subsistence allowances on thefollowing scale: For each night (to cover aperiod of 24 hours) necessarily spent away from home, 21s.; for each day of necessaryabsence from home of not less than 8hours, 7s. You will find that letter with thememorandum.Captain Henderson: Then one cannot sayreally that the two cases are identical, par-ticularly in regard to the question of feesas opposed to expenses?Mr. Anderson: No, they are quite different there. There is specific provision inthis case for the payment of a fee; in theother there is no provision at all there is merely provision in the Act for payment for loss of remunerative time. Nobody re-garded that, until recently, as constitutingremuneration.Mr. Faulkner: On the 14th November,1944. Mr. Anderson wrote to Mr.McCleery, as he then was, telling him thathe had been appointed as an assessor. was there no acknowledgment from Mr.McCleery of that letter?Mr. Anderson: It is certainly not on the records:Mr. Faulkner: The only letter that theMinistry has from Sir William is the onedated 7th December, 1955, in which heresigned?Mr. Anderson: That is quite right.Mr. Irwin: Did he in fact ever occupy the position?Mr. Anderson: No, never. As a matterof fact, we had very few cases indeed:only something like 10 appeals altogether,the last of which was in 1949. It was an Actthat really had very little effect in NorthernIreland.Mr. Irwin: The post was a meresinecure?The Chairman: Is that everything in thecase of Sir William McCleery? If so, we will now proceed to the case of Dr. Hickey.Will you tell us what you know of it, Mr.Eagleson?Mr. Eagleson: Shall I read the memor-andum?The Chairman: If you would.The following memorandum was read byMr. Eagleson:  Section 30 of the Unemployment Act(Northern Ireland), 1934, made it theduty of the Unemployment assistance board for Northern Ireland re-namedthe Assistance Board for Northern Ire-land by the Old Age and Widows&apos; Pen-sions Act (Northern Ireland), 1940, and later the National Assistance Board for northern Ireland by the National Assist-ance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948 toarrange for the establishment of advisorycommittees for such areas as the Boardthought fit.The purpose of the committees as laiddown in the Act was to secure the ad-vice and assistance of persons havinglocal knowledge and experience in mat-ters affecting the functions of the board under the Act. Section 30 also providedthat the Board might pay to members of advisory committees &quot;such travelling andother allowances (including compensationfor loss of remunerative time)&quot; as theBoard, after consultation with the Minis-ter of Labour and with the consent ofthe Ministry of Finance, might deter-mine.The Unemployment Act (NorthernIreland), 1934-Part II of which couldbe cited as the Unemployment Assist-ance Act (Northern Ireland), 1934 wasrepealed by Section 30 of and the SixthSchedule to the National Assistance Act(Northern Ireland), 1948, on the 5th July,1948. Section 3 of the National Assist-ance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, pro-vides that the National Assistance Board&quot;may arrange for the establishment of advisory committees for such areas as theBoard may think fit,&quot; and, further, thatthe Board &quot;shall pay to members of advisory committees appointed by theBoard such travelling and other allow-ances (including compensation for lossof remunerative time) as the Board, afterconsultation with the Ministry and withthe consent of the Ministry of Finance,may determine.&quot;The Fifth Schedule to the National As-assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948,also provides that advisory committeesunder Section 3 of the National Assist-Assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1934,established immediately before the 5thJuly, 1948, shall, unless and until theBoard otherwise determine, be deemedto be advisory committees established under Setcion 3 of the National Assist-ance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948.Under Section 30 of the Unemploy-ment Assistance Act (Northern Ireland),1934, the Board set up an advisory com-mittee for the Belfast Area, and by letter dated 5th September, 1945, invited Dr.Eileen M. Hickey to become a memberof it. This invitation was accepted byDr. Hickey in a letter dated the 10thSeptember, 1945. On the 28th November,1955, the chairman of the Board wrote
to her saying that the Board had been considering the reappointment of theiradvisory committees and inviting her tocontinue to serve as a member. Dr.Hickey replied on the 1st December, 1955,intimating her willingness to accept re-appointment, but on the 13th December,1955, she again wrote to the Board re-signing from the committee. Her letter was acknowledged by a letter from thechairman of the Board dated 15th De-december, 1955.Copies of the correspondence betweenthe Board and Dr. Hickey and of amemorandum setting out the current ratesof expenses and allowances payable bythe Board to members of advisory com-mittees and the conditions subject towhich they are payable are attached.Dr. Hickey has never claimed or been paid any expenses or allowances in re-spect of her membership of the com-mittee.Mr. Irwin: Dr. Hickey would have been entitled to compensation for loss of re-remunerative time?Mr. Eagleson: She should be entitled toit.Mr. Irwin: For a doctor or physicianthat might be a considerable amount?Mr. Eagleson: As Mr. Anderson has said in the case of Sir Norman Stronge, Ido not think it was ever contemplated thatprofessional people would submit claims.Mr. Irwin: No, but would she have been entitled to it?Mr. Eagleson: Oh, yes. The Act clearlyentitles her to it.Mr. Anderson: Might I reply to Mr.Irwin, who said that there might be a con-siderable amount involved. There is a limit of 30s. a day put on. That is the mostanybody could get in any circumstances?Mr. Irwin: I see. Then there is a limit for a whole week?Mr. Anderson: It is on a daily basis.Mr. Irwin: For a whole week you couldnot get more than  21?Major McConnell: That was in the caseof Sir William McCleery.Mr. Irwin: Does that not apply similarlyin this case?Mr. Anderson: No. This is a differentcase altogether. That amount you mentionwas remuneration.The Chairman: I take it that what isstated in the memorandum which, ofcourse, has only the force of a memo-randum is contained in a Statutory rule and Order or some other Regulation?Mr. Eagleson: It is contained in theSection of the Act.The Chairman: But what about theactual details, such as the amount of pay-ment?Mr. Eagleson: The details are containedin the memorandum.The Chairman: But there has been anS.R. &amp; O., I take it, as well?Mr. Eagleson: No, there was no S.R.&amp; O.The Chairman: It is done directly bythe Ministry?Mr. Eagleson: It is fixed by the Ministryof Finance departmentally.Mr. Anderson: The Board have a general power in the Act to pay expenses and com-pensation for loss of remunerative time.What they pay in detail has been fixed up with the Ministry of Finance.The Chairman: That is merely the Minis-try of Finance saying, in exercise of their power, that they would limit it to 30s. aday, or whatever it is.Mr. Anderson: There is statutory power in the Act to pay expenses, and before a department can make any payment it hasto go to the Ministry of Finance and getsanction for the actual detailed payment itis going to make. This is the arrangement made between the Board and the Ministryof Finance.Major McConnell: The reply to Mr.Irwin ought to be that there is a limitin the memorandum, and that paragraph (5)should be looked at in considering whetherthis Member would have been entitled toremuneration in the broader sense of the term. In her case it might be that she would not be considered entitled to that. i suggest that is a point that should be looked at.The Chairman: &quot;That was in my mind.Major McConnell: That does not neces-sarily reflect the terms of the Statute.The Chairman: What I am getting at isthat the Ministry of Finance, under theStatute, and without making any StatutoryRule and Order, could alter or make a difference in the category of the person who was to receive remuneration?Major McConnell: That is quite so.Mr. Anderson: Put on new conditionsor change the rates, or that kind of thing.Mr. J. W. Morgan: I should like to askMr. Eagleson if Dr. Hickey received thememorandum from the Ministry to saythat her services would be consideredvoluntarily and unpaid?Mr. Eagleson: She received, or appearsto have received, a copy of the memo-randum, which is one of the attachments.Mr. J. W. Morgan: She received thatcopy?Mr. Eagleson: All I can say is that therewas a copy sent to every person who was invited to serve on the committees, and itis a fair presumption that if the memo-randum had not accompanied the letter Dr.Hickey would have said so in her reply.There is no absolute proof.
The Chairman: It is the ordinary prac-tice of your Ministry to send one out withthe letter of appointment?Mr. Eagleson: Yes. When these persons were being invited to serve on the advisorycommittees for the Board each was sent aletter, and to that letter was attached acopy of the memorandum.Mr. Faulkner: It is not stated in the letter.Captain Henderson: Is that the memo-randum W.S.18?Mr. Faulkner: No ; it is the memorandumreferred to in the previous paragraph.Mr. Eagleson: Yes. That memorandumstated quite clearly:Members of Advisory Committees actin an honorary capacity, but travelling expenses where incurred, and compensa-sation for loss of remunerative time, are payable.The Chairman: In the letter of the 5thSeptember, 1945, in the second paragraph, itsays: &quot;There is enclosed a leaflet W.S.18&quot;.Which leaflet is that?Mr. Eagleson: It was a leaflet explanatoryof the functions of the Board at that time.I have only been able to put my hand on one copy of it, but I should be glad to hand it in.The Chairman: Perhaps if you would Wewould have everything before us. (Leaflethanded in.)Mr. Eagleson: It was explanatory of thestatutory functions of the Board.Mr. Faulkner: But not of the appoint-ment of the members of the advisory com-mittees?Mr. Eagleson: No.Mr. Faulkner: I do not think it hasmuch relevance to the point at issue.The Chairman: I am just looking at it.From a quick glance it seems to deal withthe work they do rather than the conditions under which they are appointed. Is there any other question about Dr. Hickey?Apparently there is nothing else we requirefrom these three gentlemen. Thank you,gentlemen, for your attendance and yourassistance in this matter.Major McConnell: Thank you verymuch.Major McConnell, Mr. Anderson andMr. Eagleson then withdrew.The Comm&apos;ttee adjourned until Thursday,2nd February, 1956, at 11 a.m.
Minutes of EvidenceSECOND DAYTHURSDAY, 2nd FEBRUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Thursday, 2nd February, 1956.There were present: Mr. McConnell (in the Chair), Mr. Faulkner, Mr.Hawthorne, Captain Henderson, Mr. J. W. Morgan, and Mr. W. J. Morgan.Dr. E. M. Hickey called.The Chairman: We have Dr. Hickey with us this morning and I thank her for herattendance. Dr. Hickey, I am sure you have thought this matter over. Is there anythingyou would like to tell us about it?Dr. Hickey: There is very little 1 can sayabout it. I have prepared a short statement which I think contains all the information the Committee would wish to hear, and 1think it would satisfy you. After I have read the statement I shall leave it with the Chair-man. I shall be prepared to answer any questions on it the Committee may wish toask.Following is the statement:I was appointed a member of the belfast Advisory Committee of theNational Assistance Board in September,1945. Service on these committees is re-garded as voluntary and unpaid and anyremuneration which might be paid ifclaimed-in respect of subsistence, lossof earnings, or travelling allowance, none of which I have ever claimed or received is &quot;in no sense a payment for services rendered,&quot; so that in no sense could myservices on this committee under these terms ever be regarded as an office of profit.Early in December last year my atten-tion was drawn, as a result of newspaperreports of the case of Mr. Charles Beattieat Westminster, to consider my positionas a member of the Committee. Althoughat no time did I consider that I held an&quot;office of profit under the Crown,&quot; it seemed to me that the Beattie case had made the position of a Member of Parlia-ment one of some risk, and in order toremove any possible question of my hold-ing an &quot;office of profit&quot; under the CrownI resigned from the Committee by letter dated 13th December, 1955. I believed bydoing so I had placed myself beyondattack-although I would not like tosuggest that this is an attack and it didnot occur to me to absent myself fromthe House of Commons. I subsequentlyattended the House on two occasions, but did not take part in any Division. ThePrime Ministers letter to me, dated 13thJanuary, 1956, was the first intimation that I had that I should not attend theHouse and since receiving it I have notattended.I consider that my service as a memberof this National Assistance Board Com-mittee, for which I at no time claimedor received any money, should not renderme open to the accusation of having heldan office of profit under the Crown.The Chairman: Does anyone wish toknow anything further from Dr. Hickey?Mr. Faulkner: Dr. Hickey&apos;s statement is completely in line with what the national assistance Board representative, Mr. Eagle-son, told us at our previous Sitting. It isalso in line with the situation given to us by the Attorney-General. Quite clearly Dr.Hickey never received any payment orsought any payment, and I would not wishto ask her any questions. I would thankher for coming along.The Chairman: I do not think there is anything else. The statement is very clear.Thank you very much indeed for yourattendance, Dr. Hickey. I am sorry you have had this trouble.Dr. Hickey: I am sorry you have had this trouble.Dr. Hickey then withdrew.Sir William McGleery called.The Chairman: You have probablythought out what you would like to say tous, Sir William?Sir. William McCleery: Yes. I have a notehere that I would just propose to read tothe Committee. I think it is about all I can say in this matter. Shall I just go on?The Chairman: If you would.Sir W. McCleery: During the early partof the month of December last, my atten-tion was directed, as a result of the caseof Mr. Beattie at Westminster, to considerwhether I was myself at all likely to beopen to a similar charge. At that time I didnot believe that I held any offices under theCrown at all, let alone offices of profit, butI was subsequently told that I had beenappointed an assessor under the Reinstate-ment in Civil Employment Act, 1944. I was told that the date of my appointment to thecommittee was the 14th November, 1944,but I can assure the Committee I have norecollection whatever of this appointment and I have never at any time acted under it. I believe that the Ministry of Labourrecords will confirm this:  they will cer-
tainly confirm that I never claimed orreceived any remuneration, or allowancesor any moneys of any kind whatever inrespect of this appointment. I did not there-fore consider that I was at any time the holder of an office of profit. The press reports of Mr. Beattie&apos;s case, however, leftme with the impression that the law was so technical that a Member held any office at his peril and for that reason and onaccount of what I had been told I resignedmy office as assessor by letter dated 7thDecember, 1955. I believed that by so doingI had made myself absolutely clear fromany charge of holding an office of profit.That is all that I can say.The Chairman: Is there anything that anyMember wishes to ask Sir William?Captain Henderson: I have just onequestion. You do not have any recollectionat all of being approached by the chambers of Commerce and asked if you would accept their nomination of you?Sir W. McCleery: No.Mr. J. W. Morgan: Never at any time didyou attend?57/- W. McCleery: I never heard of the thing in my life, to the best of my recollec-tion. I should be dumbfounded if I could see any document appointing me to anysuch office.Mr. Faulkner: Certainly no evidence hasbeen given to us of Sir William havingaccepted the office of assessor; but we have seen a letter which was sent from theMinistry of Labour to Sir William invitinghim to accept the office.The Chairman: Have you any recollectionof having received that letter?Sir W. McCleery: I have searched all myfiles, and so has my private secretary whowas in my employment at that time and she never heard of such a letter.Mr. Faulkner: In any event the important thing is that Sir William never sat as anassessor and never claimed any expenses ormoneys.Sir W. McCleery: I never heard that therewas such a thing.The Chairman&apos;. The letter we saw is datedthe 14th November, 1944. You have pro-bably seen a copy of it?Sir W. McCleery: Yes, I have seen a copyof it.Mr. J. W. Morgan: It was quite a sur-prise to you that you were even a member?Sir W. McCleery: I never heard of it. Inever knew that such a committee existed.The Chairman: Is that everything anyMember wishes to ask Sir William? Thankyou very much for your attendance, sir william.Sir William McCleery then withdrew.The Committee deliberated and decided to recall the Attorney-General.Sir Norman Stronge called.The Chairman: I am sure, Sir Norman,that you have thought of what you wouldlike to tell us.Sir Norman Stronge: I certainly have, butit might be as well not said. What do youwant to ask me?The Chairman: We have received amemorandum from the Ministry of Laboursetting out the details of your appointment.Mr. J. W. Morgan: Which would deceivethe very elect.The Chairman: It says in it thatthe Ministry of Labour, by letter datedthe 12th June, 1947, invited Sir NormanStronge, Bart., M.C., H.M.L., to succeedLord MacDermott as the Chairman ofthe  Central Advisory Council for  theEmployment of the Disabled.Sir. Norman Stronge:  I have a copy ofthat letter.That, of course, is correct? It is.There is also a letter from you on the14/6/47 to Mr. Brian Maginess accepting the appointment? That is right; I have ithere.Then there is a letter of the 16th January,1956, addressed to the Minister of Labourand National Insurance in which you say:In view of a letter which I have re-ceived from the Prime Minister advisingme that I may be disqualified as a Mem-ber of Parliament on the ground that mymembership   of   the   Central   AdvisoryCouncil   on   Disabled   Persons,  thoughvoluntary and unpaid, may constitute, in law,   an   &quot;office   of   profit   under   theCrown,&quot;   I   now   wish   to   resign   mymembership of the Advisory Council onDisabled Persons.Is that correct? That is right.On the 17th January, 1956, Major IvanNeill wrote a letter to you accepting thatresignation. I take it that you also received that letter? That is right.You did, of course, in fact act in this capacity?-1 certainly did, as chairman ofthe council.You did not receive any payment? Inever received any payment nor asked forany.Nor any travelling expenses? None.No   money   of   any kind? Absolutelynone.Mr. Faulkner: Did you, in fact, think you would be entitled to any expenses?Sir N. Stronge: I never thought of anyexpenses. I took on the job actually because i considered it my duty to take it on asSpeaker, with a council which consisted ofmembers of all parties and of trade unions.As it had to do with disabled ex-Servicemen and members of the British Legion considered it my duty to accept it asSpeaker and as President of the british legion. That is the reason I took it on.
The Chair man: I think that covers theground. Thank you very much for yourattendance, Sir Norman.Sir N. Stronge: Thank you very much.Sir Norman Stronge then withdrew.When the Attorney-General (Mr. EdmondWarnock) arrived, he was invited by theChairman to remain and hear the evidenceof the next witness.Mr. T. Stanley Lyle called.The Chairman: First of all, Mr. Lyle,would you give the Committee your officialdesignation. Is it secretary?Mr. Lyle: No, Mr. Coop is the honorarysecretary of the Association of Chambers ofCommerce Northern Ireland. I am Mr.Coop&apos;s assistant. He would have been herebut, unfortunately, he is ill at the moment.Is it the Association of Chambers ofCommerce? Northern Ireland chambers of Commerce.Do you know that we are inquiring intothe case of Sir William McCleery? I do.First of all there was a letter dated 8thSeptember, 1944, sent to Mr. T. R. Whithamat 7 Donegall Squire West, Belfast. Thatletter was sent on behalf of the Ministry ofLabour and National Insurance and it in-invited your Association to nominate oneassessor for the purposes of the Reinstate-ment in Civil Employment Act, 1944. Thatletter probably appears on your files? Yes.I have not got that correspondence of 1944.What the Committee want to know isafter preliminary acknowledgment of thatletter on the 11th October, 1944; by yourAssociation there was a second letter from your Association dated 4th November, 1944,in which it is stated:Dear Sir,Further to your letter of the 8th Sept-ember, I am instructed to inform you that Mr. W. V. McCleery, J.P., ofBalnamore, Ballymoney, Co. Antrim,has been nominated as assessor, and Ihave forwarded to him the leaflet R.E.L.which you sent with your letter.The Attorney-General: From whom isthat letter dated 4th November?The Chairman: It is from Mr. Whitham.The Attorney -General: He says somethingwas forwarded to Sir William McCleery.The Chairman: Yes, Mr. Lyle, have youany record in your minutes or in any docu-ment as to how your Association nominatedMr. McCleery, as he then was?Mr. Lyle: I have a minute of the meetingof the Association of Northern IrelandChambers of Commerce which took placeon the 3rd November, 1944. The minutereads:Reinstatement in Civil EmploymentAct, 1944. On the proposal of Mr.Leyburn, seconded by Mr. Herbert Quin,it was   unanimously   agreed   that   Mr.W. V. McCleery be appointed to act asAssessor under the Act.That is all there is in the minute.Have you in that minute a list of themembers present?-Yes.Was Sir William McCleery amongstthem? Yes.He was present at the meeting? Yes.In the letter which your Secretary wroteon the 4th November he says &quot;I forwarded to him&quot; meaning Sir William McCleery &quot;aleaflet . . .&quot; Have you any record of aletter sent to Sir William? None.Have you looked? Yes.Mr. Faulkner: Was there ever anyacknowledgment by Sir William to theAssociation?Mr. Lyle: I do not know. I think the fileshave been destroyed.The Chairman: It is not that they are missing from the files; it is that you havenot got the files?Mr. Lyle: That is so. I would have a copyof the letter. We have a copy of all the letters sent out. There is no copy of aletter to Sir William McCleery.The Attorney-General: Is there not acopy which says: &quot;I have forwarded toMr. McCleery . . . .&quot;?Mr. Lyle: Yes, there is a copy of thatletter.The Chairman: The Ministry have theoriginal of that letter.Mr. J. W. Morgan: At that meeting on 3rd November when his name was put up,did Sir William McCleery agree or disagree?Mr. Lyle: There is no note about that.Mr: Faulkner: Just to be absolutely clearon this matter, Mr. Lyle has told us that sir William McCleery was present at that meeting. Could he have been present at thebeginning of the meeting and not present when this nomination took place?Mr. Lyle: It is possible; sometimes mem-bers do leave early.The Chairman: How do you get the listof members present? Do they sign as they come in or is the list made during themeeting?Mr. Lyle: At the moment the practice isfor one of the staff to take the names ofall members as they are going into themeeting.So that the record of attendance is really a record of those entering the meeting?-That is correct.Mr. Hawthorne: Are copies of theminutes circulated to members following the meetings?Mr. Lyle: No, they are not circulated.The Chairman: Were the minutes of that particular meeting read at the next meet-ing of the Association?Mr. Lyle: They do not appear to havebeen.
The Attorney-General: It usually starts The minutes of the previous meeting wereread and approved.Mr. Lyle: There is no record of that hav-ing been done at the following meeting.Mr. J. W. Morgan: Have you the minute for 3rd December, the meeting afterthe 3rd November?Mr. Lyle: The following meeting was aspecial meeting. Other than a special meet-ing the next meeting was 1st February,1946.The Chairman: Neither at the special meeting nor at the subsequent meeting werethe minutes of 3rd November read?Mr. Lyle: No.The Attorney-General: Were you in office at that time?Mr. Lyle: No. The present secretary wasnot in office at that time either.The Chairman: Is there anything furtherwe wish from Mr. Lyle? Thank you verymuch, Mr. Lyle, for your attendance.Mr. Lyle then withdrew.The Attorney-General recalled.The Chairman: We should like to thankyou very much, Mr. Attorney-General, forcoming back to the Committee at suchshort notice.The Attorney-General: I am sorry I have:not my papers with me, but I came straightaway when summoned by the Committee.The Chairman: There is a point on whichwe would like your guidance. You probably have had an opportunity of reading whsitSir William McCleery has said in evidence.We should like your opinion whether onthe facts on which he has given evidence,and particularly when he says that he hasno recollection of appointment, it is neces-sary that there should be acceptance to constitute appointment to an office of thiskind so as to disqualify a Member, and,secondly, whether there seems to besufficient evidence that he did.The Attorney-General: This point is notnew to me, as I have it in greater detailthan I had before. Might I just summarisethe view that I would present to the Com-mittee? You now have evidence that sir william McCleery was present at the meet-ing on 3rd November, 1944, when he wasnominated by the Association of chambers of Commerce, and there is no evidence thathe protested or was unwilling to accept theappointment. There is the letter of 4thNovember, 1944, to the Secretary of theMinistry of Labour stating that a document was being forwarded to Sir WilliamMcCleery which indicated that he had been nominated for this position. We have some-where on the file a minute of appointment.I have not my papers with me, but I think I)T1am right in saying that there is a minute of appointment which purports to have beensent to Sir William McCleery. As against those three positive facts you have to balance Sir William McCleery&apos;s recollec-tions. My advice to the Committee wouldbe that they would be entitled upon thatevidence to find that Sir William McCleeryhad been appointed. I cannot go further than that. I think you are entitled to balance the three known facts as againstrecollection. The three known facts all in-dicate fairly strongly that Sir WilliamMcCleery knew he was going to beappointed; that he was, in fact, appointed,and the minute of appointment was sentto hini. We all accept immediately sir william&apos;s statement that he has no recol-lection of it, but I think the Committeewould be entitled to find on the evidencethat he had been appointed, and there isthe fact of his acquiescence at the meetingon 3rd November, 1944, which I feel would indicate acceptance. Beyond that I doubt whether I could go any farther.The Chairman: There is also the letter ofthe 14th November, 1944, sent by theMinistry and addressed to &quot;W. V.McCleery, Esq.&quot;The Attorney-General: There is always the strong presumption that a letter whichis put in the post reaches its destinationand any Committee such as this would beentitled, in the absence of evidence to thecontrary, to say that he got that letter. if sir William McCleery said he never re-ceived such a letter then you could querywhether the letter, duly posted, arrived, butin the absence of any positive statement bySir William McCleery that he never re-ceived the letter, the Committee would be perfectly justified in concluding, if you aresatisfied that the letter of 14th november was sent, that it reached its destination. sir william is dealing with a matter of re-collection of 11 years ago and as he is aman of very many interests and responsi-bilities I am not surprised that he has norecollection of it and that the matter hasescaped his memory, but there is a greatdeal of evidence before the Committee toshow that he was appointed, if the Com-mittee feel disposed to act upon thatevidence.The Chairman: Is there anything elsewhich the Committee would like to ask the Attorney-General? Thank you, Mr.Attorney-General.The Attorney-General: I will not say itis a pleasure, but I am very willing to behere.The Attorney-General then withdrew.The Committee proceeded to considerthe Draft Report, and concluded theirdeliberations.
