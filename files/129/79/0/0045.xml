Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   5 3CP. (56) 4521st February 1956.CABINETICELAND FISHERIES dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the Cabinet last discussed the possibility of settling the Iceland fisheries disputeon 14th May, 1953 (C.C. (53) 31st Conclusions, Minute 7). They agreed that her majesty&apos;s Government should take no further initiative following the rejection bythe Iceland Government of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ proposal for a reference ofcertain base-lines to the International Court of Justice, but decided to await a positive proposal from the Iceland Government. No such proposal was evermade, but in 1954 Iceland raised the subject of the boycott of Iceland-caught fishin the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.). her majesty&apos;s Government then encouraged the Organisation to set up an informalGroup, consisting of a Swiss chairman, with Norwegian and Belgian assessors, to seek a solution in association with representatives of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Iceland Government.2. We think that the time has now come to inform our colleagues of develop-ments. A brief account of the negotiations is at Annex A and the text of proposalsfor a settlement, put forward by the Group at their latest meeting held from24th to 26th January, is at Annex B.3.   These proposals may be summarised as follows:  (a) The Iceland Government will declare that they will make no change intheir fishery limits until the report of the International Law Commissionon the regimes of the high seas and of the territorial sea has beenconsidered by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its next session.(b) The Iceland Government will state that British and other foreign trawlersmay seek shelter within the present fishery limits in bad weather without first being required to stow their gear. They will also be allowed tosell their catch in Iceland ports if delayed there by damage.-(c) The Iceland Government offered an agreement to regulate the landingsof Iceland-caught fish in United Kingdom ports; in view of her majesty&apos;s Governmenfs general commercial policy, this agreement mustbe made between the fishing industries of the two countries.(d) In return for the foregoing, the British fishing industry will remove the boycott on Iceland-caught fish in United Kingdom ports.(e) The O.E.E.C. Group will remain in being and may be reconvened at need.&quot; 4. The declaration which the Iceland Government offer in fulfilment of (a)above appears to us to be acceptable and that at (b) above is- satisfactory,, 5. As regards (c) above, an agreement to regulate landings is to be negotiatedunder the auspices of O.E.E.C. by representatives of the fishing industries of the&apos;two countries. The first meeting was held from 8th-9th February. Progress wasmade but a further meeting will be necessary. At the insistent request of the Iceland Government, and with the support of the O.E.E.C. Group, both sides were accompanied by observers from their Governments.49595
6. We have consulted the President of the Board of Trade on whether anagreement, which would depend essentially on a unilateral undertaking by the Iceland industry to regulate landings of their fish in the United Kingdom, would come within the scope of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill. We understand thatit will not, but that the President would wish to look at the matter again, if thereshould be criticism in the House.   In that event, we would ask to be consulted.7. We are satisfied that settlement on these lines, providing for a standstillarrangement on the fishery limits, with reservation of the legal position of bothsides, is all that is feasible at this time; and that it best safeguards the essential interests of the British fishing industry while the search for internationallyrecognised criteria for the determination of fishery limits is being pursued. It alsoensures that the Iceland Government will not yield for a certain period to the continuing pressure from their own fishing interests for extension of the limits.The period is admittedly imprecise and cannot be certainly reckoned beyond theend of the 1956 General Assembly, which will probably be by Easter 1957. Never-theless, w&amp; regard this as a favourable development and consider that there is good reason to hope that the agreement would improve the atmosphere and prepare theway for a final agreed settlement of the problem.8. A prolongation of the dispute would increase the economic dependence of Iceland on the Soviet bloc; it would also strengthen the hands of the communists in Iceland, whose aim is to deny the United States the use of the vital air base atKeflavik and to bring about the withdrawal of Iceland from the North atlantic treaty Organisation.9. The proposed settlement will create a complication with the Faroe Islands.An Anglo-Danish agreement was signed last year establishing wider fishery limits for the Faroes, drawn generally three miles from the islands. This agreementcannot be denounced until 1965; but the Danes, who have their own difficulties withthe Faroes, are asking for it to be modified on the ground that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have agreed to a 4-mile limit off Iceland. This is not so, as theO.E.E.C. proposals are without prejudice to the legal position. We think it willbe necessary to stand firm and refuse to renegotiate the Faroese Agreement, atleast until the United Nations have considered the report of the International law commission on the regimes of the high seas and of the territorial sea. We do notconsider that this Faroese complication should deter us from the Icelandicsettlement.S. L.J. S.D. H. A.&apos;   20th February, 1956.Annex AHISTORY OF THE ICELAND FISHERIES dispute in 1952 the Iceland Government imposed new fishery limits, drawn at a distance of four miles from a series of base lines across the bays and inlets of the Iceland coast. Until this time, the Iceland limits had been at a distance of three miles from low water mark. The Iceland Governments action deprived the british fishing industry of valuable fishing grounds. In retaliation, the industry imposed a boycott of Iceland-caught fish in United Kingdom ports.2. All the States interested in the Iceland fisheries protested at this unilateralextension of the limits, but it was only in the United Kingdom that any action, evenunofficial, was taken against Iceland; as a result, the dispute has assumed a bilateralcharacter, although the United Kingdom is in fact fighting the battles of several other European States. Her Majesty&apos;s Government proposed first that the matters in dispute should be referred to the International Court of Justice; the iceland government refused, unless the boycott were removed before any hearings atThe Hague. The British fishing industry refused to lift their boycott until the Iceland Government also has restored the status quo by reverting to the former
limits; Her Majesty&apos;s Government were therefore unable to accept the Icelandcondition, as it would have been difficult to compel the industry to remove the boycott, particularly as Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the industry have some reason to consider themselves the injured party.3. Numerous attempts were made to settle the dispute, but no progress wasmade until the O.E.E.C. became involved. Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcomeda proposal by the Swiss delegate that an informal Group should be set up to try tofind a solution. The Group consists of the Swiss delegate, as Chairman,accompanied by one assessor chosen by each side; the Iceland Government chosethe Norwegian representative, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government nominated theBelgian.4. After the Iceland representative had refused to discuss any modification ofthe new fishery limits, the Chairman proposed a settlement on the basis of adeclaration by the Iceland Government that they would not extend their limitsfurther until the International Law Commission of the United Nations had completed its work on the regime of the territorial sea and of the high seas, and itsreport had been considered at the Session of the General Assembly of the united nations in November 1956.5. Sufficient time had passed since the imposition of the new limits for their effect on the catch of the British distant water fleet to be estimated. It appeared that no serious loss had been inflicted on the British industry, but that any further extension of the limits would be harmful. The Iceland Law under which the 1952limits were promulgated envisages eventual control of fisheries throughout the waters above the continental shelf surrounding Iceland, extending anything up tofifty miles from the coast; while the Iceland Government have taken no steps toput these powers into effect, they have been under continual pressure to extend thelimits. The extension of the limits is bound to be an issue in the general electionswhich must take place not later than the summer of 1957.6. The Parliamentary Under-Secretaries at the Foreign Office and theScottish Office, and the Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture,met representatives of the trawler owners, of the trawler officers and of the fishmerchants on 14th December, 1955, and commended these proposals to them. Thismeeting had been preceded by a considerable amount of preparatory work and representatives of the fishing industry, at a further meeting on 5th January, 1956,expressed their willingness to remove the boycott if the conditions set out in theproposals were complied with by the Iceland Government.7. At the last meeting of the O.E.E.C. Group, held in Paris from24th to 26th January, the proposals were elaborated and defined, emerging in theform set out at Annex B. The United Kingdom representative undertook to persuade the British fishing industry to enter into negotiations as soon as possible with representatives of the Iceland fishing industry for the resumption in an orderly manner of landings of Iceland-caught fish in United Kingdom ports. The iceland government, having apparently realised the danger of dependence on Sovietmarkets, were prepared to accept the proposals; they had taken steps to ensure the eventual passage through the Iceland Parliament of a resolution recommending thatthere should be no extension of the limits for the time being, and had prepared adeclaration to cover the remaining point in the Chairman&apos;s proposals.8. Representatives of the two industries had a prior exchange of views inParis, under the auspices of O.E.E.C., on 8th and 9th February.Annfx BAide-Memoire by the Informal Group of O.E.E.C.The informal Group, which was set up by the Council of the O.E.E.C. witha view to reaching a settlement of the dispute expounded to the Organisation byIceland and the United Kingdom, met from 24th to 26th January, 1956.2. At this meeting, the representatives of Iceland and the United Kingdominformed the Group of the following measures, envisaged on both sides and considered likely to facilitate the settlement of this dispute.
: .3. It was agreed that these measures do not imply a renunciation by theGovernment of Iceland of what it considers to be its rights as regards the determination of fishery limits, or a recognition by the United KingdomGovernment of the validity in law of the measures taken in this respect by theGovernment of Iceland.4. On the suggestion of the representative of Iceland it was agreed, first,that representatives of the fishing industries of both countries should be invitedto meet in Paris, if necessary together with observers of their Governments, inorder to conclude an agreement for the resumption in an orderly manner of thesupply of Iceland-caught fish to the United Kingdom market: secondly, that negotiations should begin as soon as possible after 1st February, 1956, under the auspices of the Organisation, and with the good offices of the Group. these negotiations should be concluded at the latest in time to allow the Chairman ofthe Group to report to the Council within the time limit specified in paragraph below.5. The representatives of Iceland also informed the Group that the following draft Resolution was now before the Althing (Iceland Parliament):  &quot; Whereas, upon the initiative of Iceland, the regime of territorial watershas for some time been under study in the United Nations together with the regime of the high seas;- : The Althing does not consider it advisable to take decisions regarding theextension of the fishery limits until the 1956 General Assembly of the united nations has been terminated and there has been time to study any considera-tions which may emerge from the discussion of these matters in the Assembly;Therefore the Althing resolves to proceed to the next item on its Agenda.&quot;The representative of Iceland pointed out in this connection that it was proposed to submit this draft Resolution to the Althing for adoption before thedate fixed for submitting to the Council the Report referred to in paragraph below, and that, if this draft Resolution were adopted, the Iceland Governmentwould notify the Organisation and at the same time confirm that its termsrepresented the policy of the Iceland Government in this matter.6. Finally, the representative of Iceland informed the Group that, on theconclusion of the agreement referred to in paragraph 4 above, his Governmentwould be in a position to make the following official statement:  &quot; The Icelandic Government confirms officially that, while existing: legislation requires the stowing of fishing gear (though not of catch) inside the fishery limits, this legislation will, as hitherto, not be considered to be applicable to a foreign fishing vessel v/hich has had to seek shelter because of bad weather or for other reasons of force majeure.In such cases, an Icelandic patrol vessel or the Fisheries Inspection ofReykjavik must be immediately informed of the fishing vessel&apos;s position aswell as of its intended course, and the fishing gear must be stowed as soon as circumstances permit. A foreign fishing vessel which enters an Icelandicport because of engine trouble or. other defects, or of damage to the vessel,will, as hitherto, be permitted to sell its catch there if the catch might otherwise be spoiled while repairs were being effected.7. The representative of the United Kingdom informed the Group that theUnited Kingdom fishing industry were willing to lift the boycott of Iceland-caughtfish on the United Kingdom market as soon as an agreement to regulate the supplyof such fish had been reached and on condition that the measures provided forin paragraphs 5 and 6 above had also been taken.8. The Group took note of the Statements of the representatives of Icelandand the United Kingdom and requested them to keep the. Chairman of the Groupinformed of the measures taken or contemplated in accordance with paragraphs 4to 7 above in order to enable him to report to the Council at the latest by25th February, 1956, when he would propose that the Council should:  (i) note the measures taken by the two parties, and(ii) keep the Group in being so that it might be reconvened at the request ofany of its members or either of the parties.
