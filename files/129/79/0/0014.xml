ISSUE OF A PASSPORT TO DR. ALAN NUNN MAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have learned that the East German Government may offer anappointrneat to Dr. Nunn May.    In that event, he may wish to visitEast Germany to investigate the offer;  he may therefore apply for apassport.2.       On Dr. Nunn May&apos;s release from prison in December, 1952, theCabinet decided that if he applied for a passport his application shouldbe refused (C.C,(52) 108th Conclusions, Minute 6).     This decision took account of precedents which suggested that in the very rare cases wherethe activities of an individual are notoriously undesirable or dangerousParliament may be expected to uphold a decision to refuse him a pass-port.    Applications by Nunn May for a passport since then have been refused, principally on the ground that if one were issued to him he might defect, and that his defection would seriously prejudice Anglo-American negotiations on the exchange of information about atomicmatters.3. If Dr, Nunn May applies for a passport the following considerationswill apply:In favour(i) The Anglo-American agreements on the exchangeof information about atomic matters were signed in June and came into force in July last;(ii) in August last, the Prime Minister agreed to aproposal by the Foreign Secretary and the HomeSecretary that a passport should be issued toMrs. Nunn May in order to enable her to visitAustria on holiday;(iii) strictly from the point of view of security, there isno objection to Nunn May leaving the country,since he possesses no technical information whichwould be of value to the Russians;   in Sir JohnCockcroffs view Nunn May was never outstandingas an academic worker;  he is intellectuallydefinitely not in the alpha plus category and it isdoubtful whether he even deserves an alpha rating;this view is confirmed by Sir Edwin Plowden;3?The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of............................TOP SECRET Copy NoC.P.(56) 1416th January, 1956CABINET
(iv) Nunn May does not, in law, need a passport toleave the United Kingdom;   to do so he needs onlyto establish his identity and status, e. g. by a birthcertificate;   with certain delays and difficulties hemay well be able to reach East Germany withouta passport;  nor would he need one in order to re-enter the United Kingdom;(v) although there would be special considerations in thisparticular case a section of public opinion is opposedin principle to the refusal of passports, which it looksupon as a hindrance to the freedom of movement and an infringement of the rights of the individual.Against[i) Nunn May&apos;s wife is known to hold Communist views and he himself is thought still to favour them;(2) the fact that the Anglo-American Agreements on atomic energy are now in force (see (i) above) does not mean that Anglo-American co-operation on atomic mattersis necessarily ensured for the future on the scale we desire;   in the telegram attached (Annex A)H.M. Ambassador, Washington, has strongly represented that Nunn May&apos;s defection, harmless as it may be fromthe scientific point of view, is likely to produce a    &apos;severe reaction in the United States unfavourable tothe expanded co-operation on atomic energy matters which we seek.4.      The position therefore seems to be as follows:(a) We do not believe that in itself Nunn May&apos;s defectionto Eastern Germany would be harmful to our security or beneficial, from the point of view of nuclear research, to a potential enemy;(b) if Nunn May is determined to leave the country hecan do so without a passport but, on past form, itseems probable that if he decides to leave he will apply for a passport;(c) I am not under a legal obligation to grant a passportto anyone, but in practice passports are only refusedwhen, because of the nature of the case, Parliamentmay be expected to uphold the decision;(d) the question at issue is therefore whether continued and expanded co-operation with the United states on atomic energy matters justifies the denial ofa passport.5. This question is a very delicate one and I shall be glad to know the views of my colleagues.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.14th January, 1956.
Following personal from the Ambassador.This matter should be looked at in the light of our specificobjectives in the atomic energy field as far as the United StatesGovernment is concerned.These are:(a) to ensure our raw material requirements overthe next ten years;(b) to get agreement to the exchange of information about nuclear propulsion and other &quot;package&quot;reactors;(c) to secure substantial quantities of fissile material(U. 235) and other materials needed for theUnited Kingdom programme;(d) to make the exchange of information under thetwo existing agreements fully effective.2.      Of these certainly (b) and (c) and probably (a) require formalor informal approval of the Joint Congressional Committee, which isalso in a position to impede the achievement of (d).3.      It may very well be that Dr. Mayrs usefulness on the other sideof the Iron Curtain is limited as suggested in paragraph 2 of your tele-gram, but even friendly Americans are incapable of taking so objective and temperate a view.     The uneasiness about our security arrangements and about our handling of such cases as that of Dr. May, which was once more aroused by the press campaign in the United Kingdom on theBurgess and Maclean case, is I hope, now subsiding.    In my view, itwould be folly to raise it again by letting Dr. May cross the Iron Curtain.4.      I dare say that the effect of allowing him to go would be no morelasting than the effect of other cases has been lasting in any specificsense.    In other words it would probably not be permanent.     But itwould certainly be severe, and quite severe enough to prevent, duringthe present session of Congress, the attainment of the objectives whichI have set out in paragraph 1.     It would give the opportunity to those elements in the Congress, and also in the Commission itself, which arehostile to more extended co-operation with us and who, for one reason or another, wish to embarrass Admiral Strauss, to combine to defeatany further development of Anglo-American co-operation in this field.You will of course realise that if such a setback were to occur, a full year would elapse before we could hope to recover lost ground.5.      My view is therefore that Dr. May should at all costs be prevented from leaving the United Kingdom until the adjournment of congress and such time thereafter as may be necessary for tiie&apos;A.E.C,to put into effect whatever decisions have emerged from Congress inthe atomic field of importance to our atomic energy co-operation.
