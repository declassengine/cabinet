ZlMONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES:THE IRON AND STEEL board memorandum by the Lord ChancellorMy colleagues will recall that on 20th December the cabinet agreed that the new Bill on restrictive practices should be drawn up onthe basis of entrusting jurisdiction over restrictive practices to anindependent judicial tribunal (C.M.(55) 47th Conclusions, Minute 5).The Committee of Ministers concerned with the Monopolies commission report have had before them a letter from Sir Archibald Forbes, Chairmanof the Iron and Steel Board (I.S.B.), to the President of the Board of Trade,In this he asked that provision be made in the Bill for the exclusion ofthe iron and steel industry from the new tribunals field of enquiry andfor the grant to the I.SeB. of any powers of examination or adjudicationgiven to the tribunal, on the ground that the position of the Board in relationto the industry which they were set up to supervise would otherwise befatally undermined.     The l05.3. have asked that their views be conveyed to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and that their Chairman be given  an opportunity of enlarging on the matter with the Prime Minister.2. The Committee have found this a difficult matter.     TheI.S.B. is a statutory body,  set up as a result of a major decision to substitute independent ownership of the industrys with a supervisory body,for nationalisation, and it is vital to this conception that such a supervisorybody should be kept strong and effective.     Under the Iron and Steel Act,1953, the Board were charged with the duty of exercising a general super-vision over the industry &quot;with a view to promoting the efficient,  economicand adequate supply under competitive conditions of iron and steel products&quot;and they have regarded the underlined words as covering amongst other things a review of restrictive practices within the iron and steel industryjupon which they are now engaged.     They are empowered to fix maximum prices (although the President of the Board of Trade has overriding reserve powers ) and could perhaps thus exercise some sanction, albeit incomplete,against restrictive practices.     Although the I.S.B&apos;s. policy with regardto maximum prices would not, of course, be subject to the jurisdiction of the new tribunal, other restrictive arrangements would be liable to review by the tribunal as they are to-day liable to review by the monopolies Commission.     If the industry or sections of it were to behaled before the new tribunal, a difference might develop between theviews expressed by the I.S.B. and the tribunal and two statutory bodiesmight be seen in conflict.3. On the other hand, apart from such effect as may result fromtheir power to fix maximum prices, the I.S.B. have at present no legalpower to prohibit restrictive practices which they might consider contrary-1 -COPY NO.

to the public interest.     The only legal procedure to put an end torestrictive practices in the iron and steel industry is under the monopolies Act,  1948, to which the industry is at present subject.     Theaction proposed under the new Bill would thus   in no way detract fromthe present position of the I,S.B,f in that it would simply substitute a judicial process under the new independent tribunal for the presentadministrative process under the Monopolies Commission.     This wouldby no means preclude the continuance of the Board&apos;s own enquiry intorestrictive practices in the iron and steel industry: indeed, the further the Board could carry these with the agreement of the industry, the lessneed should there be for any early external review of collective agree-ments within that industry.     To exclude the iron and steel industry fromthe ambit of the Bill would either mean that all power of controllingrestrictive practices within the industry was removed, which would beobviously indefensible - or that special legislation would be necessary to invest the I.S.B. with the powers which it is proposed to give to theindependent judicial body.     There would then be real danger of conflictingpolicies and principles being applied by the Board, on the one hand, to theiron and steel industry and by the tribunal to industry generally on theother, and the objective approach to the problem of restrictive practices which has been sought through the principle of an independent judicialbody functioning on a defined justiciable issue might be gravely impaired.The steel industry might then indeed be regarded as on much the same footing as a nationalised industry.     This would not be acceptable to theindustry itself.     The Committee concluded, therefore, that the balanceof advantage lay in not attempting to exclude the iron and steel industry from the new Bill.4. The President of the Board of Trade made clear his strong feeling that it would be difficult to carry through the Bill if the iron andsteel industry were omitted.     The Bill has now assumed considerable political importance and there is little to be said for weakening it by   .compromise.    He agreed however with the Committee that it would be an embarrassment if the Bill had to be put through in the teeth of the I,S0B.The Committee agreed therefore that there was much to be said forattempting to get the Board to see this matter in its proper perspectiveas in no way impairing their present position in relation to the industry.The Committee accordingly agreed to recommend that the President of theBoard of Trade might receive the I.S.B., announce to them a firmdecision about the inclusion of the iron and steel industry within the newBill, but at the same time undertake that agreements within the industry would not be called up for registration (and would not therefore come beforethe tribunal) until the Board&apos;s own review of restrictive practices hadbeen completed and considered by the Board of Trade.     It would then befor the President to call up agreements in the iron and steel industry for registration and to make a reference to the tribunal if he saw fit afterconsultation with the I.S.B.    This course avoids both the necessity foran amendment to the Steel Act which might well be hotly contested by the steel industry and at the same time preserves the position of the Iron andSteel Board as closely as possible to that existing at the present time.5. It is for this course that I now seek my colleagues&apos; authority on behalf of the Committee.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1.10th January, 1956.
