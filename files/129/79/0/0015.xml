NEWSPRINTMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will recall that they approved the proposals which put to them last July with regard to newsprint rationing (CM. (55) 27th.Conclusions, Minute 6).     These involved two stepss-(a) a high ceiling for imports which would effectivelyallow the newspapers to buy all the newsprintthey can find, i. e. the Government would nolonger be the limiting factor on supplies;(b) an ending of statutory controls on distributionsubject to preserving the position of the smallusers.In accordance with these decisions, I announced last August the Govem-departments intention to end the rationing of newsprint after a period of sixmonths, which was provided to enable the manufacturers and users of newsprint to arrange among themselves to regulate consumption withinthe supplies available.    I said that the Government would require to be assured that adequate provision had been made for the small newspapers,2,    . I said in my previous submission that I would review the positionin December, and this I have now done.     The outcome is that the NewsprintSupply Company (which represents all the large national daily and Sundaiypapers) and the Newspaper Society (covering all the provincial press,including the small weeklies) have, with one dissentient (&quot;The Times&quot;)asked for the existing controls to be continued after next March,3.      The Newsprint Supply Company have represented that supplies are insufficient to permit the unrestricted use of newsprint;   that the futureoutlook is less satisfactory than it was last August, due to the large andunexpected increase in world demand (especially in the United States);   andthat recent changes in the newspaper industry, including some increases in price and some amalgamations, have added to their difficulties.     while they have made every effort to secure an agreement to share out whatnewsprint is available,  they have failed,,4.      The home mills have entered into commercial contracts with several newspapers which exceed in total by some 20 per cent their present rate of output.    Increased production by the home mills would not enablethem to meet current contracts in full before 1958.    A number of thesmaller users have no contracts with the home mills.    Revocation of controls automatically makes these contracts operative, and no contractCOPY NO, STT)faCONFIDENTIAL,CP, (56) 1519th January, 1956CABINET
holder was prepared to concede his rights to allow sufficient to be retained by the home mills to meet the essential needs of the small consumers.While the home mills were anxious, even to the point of risking possible action in the Courts, to safeguard the position of the small users, myconsidered view is that such an onus should not be placed on the manufacturers of newsprint nor should the position of the smaller usersbe left in such a state of doubt.    Much against my desires and wishes,I have, therefore, been forced to conclude that some control must continue for the time being.    We can at least now say that we are continuing controlat the express request of the newspapers.5.      The position of &quot;The Times&quot; is that so long ago as 1950 they made it clear that they would take steps to overcome their raw materialsshortage by arranging for the installation of new capacity by a papermanufacturer to produce &quot;mechanical printing paper&quot; (which is a betterand substantially more expensive form of paper of the kind used bymagazines, and which is not rationed).     This new capacity, I understand,is financed, or largely financed, by &quot;The Times&quot;.     The machine is justabout to start production.     &quot;The Times&quot; had planned to change to this papeand would then surrender some 10, 000 tons of newsprint which it is atpresent using annually.6.     Having, by its own enterprise, provided for all the paper which itwould need,  &quot;The Times&quot; wished to increase its size from an average of15 pages a day, to which it is now restricted, to 24 pages.    &quot;The Times&quot;has told me that it would not be economic to use this better quality paperunless it publishes an average of approximately 21 pages daily.7.      There are three courses open to me:-(i)    To proceed to de-ration newsprint and the newspapersnext March, as intended.    It is in many ways temptingto do this.    Until they were offered freedom the Presspersistently clamoured for it.    A substantially largerqua.ntity of newsprint is available now than in previous years -But this compares with pre-war consumption of,1, 100, 000 tons.    To end rationing would be against the express wishes of the whole of the national and provincial press,  excepting &quot;The Times&quot;, and would on the latest advice I have from the Newsprint SupplyCompany run the risk of many of the smaller weeklyand provincial papers and the other users of newsprinthaving serious trouble in getting their newsprint.1953195419551956649,000 tons722, 000 tons315. 000 tons870, 000 tons (estimated)To ration all newspapers using newsprint, but to free anynewspaper using the better quality and more expensivemechanical printing paper.    I have discussed with the newspapers a number of ways in which control might beretained for newsprint while permitting the free use of mechanical printing paper.     The conclusion reached in
every case, however, was that there were serious objections which made the course impracticable.     Thedifficulty would be caused by a chain reaction,  started bythe &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and followed by other national news-papers trying to keep up with &quot;The Times or the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.    While, for economic reasons, the switch tomechanical printing paper might not be large, mere mightbe sufficient diversion of productive capacity from news-print to mechanical printing paper to create serious problems for the ether newspapers still using newsprint,together with a scramble for the mechanical printings atpresent used by the periodicals.(iii)    To accept the request of the Newsprint Supply. company for rationing and make the best judgment that I can inthe dispute between them and &quot;The Times&quot;.     There isa wide gulf between them and &quot;The Times&quot;.     Thefigure which the Newsprint Supply Company would have in mind for &quot;The Times&quot; is 15 pages while &quot;The Times&quot;contemplate 240    In my judgment the sensible course is to fix a figure of 21 pages for &quot;The Times&quot; which isthe minimum at which they consider that they caneconomically adopt their new methods of printing.     this figure would be conditional upon them giving up to theNewsprint Supply Company the whole of their newsprintallocation.    In the unlikely event of any other newspaperchanging over wholly to mechanical printing paperobtained from new capacity, it would have to be treated in a similar way to &quot;The Times&quot;.8.     I seek the approval of my colleagues for the last of the courses in paragraph 7.    I cannot assert that it will be uncontroversial.    Thereis no solution of the newsprint problem which avoids controversy - faced,however, with a demand for rationing and a disagreement as to what the ration for &quot;The Times&quot; should be, we must make the best judgment thatwe can,9.      I would add that throughout my talks with the representatives ofthe Newsprint Supply Company I have pointed out the invidious position inwhich the Press are placing themselves by their request for continuedcontrol.    Shortage of material is not necessarily an argument forGovernment rationing.    Many industries are short of raw material orcompelled to seek more expensive substitutes.    I am anxious to avoid thereal danger of finding ourselves in permanent control over the size of newspapers.    I have told the Newsprint Supply Company that in announcing the continuance of any scheme I will only do so upon the basis that it isat their express request and to obviate the risk to the small papers if wegot rid of it too soon.    It is even possible that by the end of this year theremoval of the Defence Powers under which controls are operated will bevery much a political matter, and it would be difficult, if not impossible,to advance a case for continued operation of Defence Regulations solely toretain, at the request of the Press, a statutory control on the distribution and use of newsprint.    In these circumstances we can only reluctantlyacquiesce in a continuance of control upon the basis that every effort will bemade to remove it by the end of this year.P0T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.18th January, 1956.
