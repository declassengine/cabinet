(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SE C R E TC,P. (56) 2720th January, 1956AMENDMENT OF THE LAV/ RELATING TO MURDERMemoranclurn by the Secretary of State for the Home&quot;department and Minister for Welsh affairs my colleagues will recall that there are certain secondaryrecommendations of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment whichwould require legislation and on which, since we were not disposed to legislate to give effect to the main recommendations, we have not hitherto thought it necessary to take a decision.    The principalrecommendations in this category are that   -(a) the doctrine of constructive malice should be abolishedsubject to a proviso relating to accomplices;(b) the law relating to provocation should be amended sothat provocation by words alone may reduce murderto manslaughter;(c) a person who aids, abets or instigates suicide shouldbe guilty of that offence and not of murder.COPY NO.      &apos;1   iCABINET2. There is in my view no objection in principle to these recommendations, but as I said in paragraph 20 of my memorandum of16th December, 1955 (C.P.(55) 202), I then saw no point and some embarrasment in introducing legislation on these points alone, since we should be pressed to take the opportunity of giving effect to other and more controversial recommendations.    Since that paper was circu-lated, however, the situation has been changed by the publication of areport by a Committee of the Inns of Court Conservative and UnionistSociety under the Chairmanship of Sir Lionel Heald.     This Committeehas recommended the amendment of the law to give effect to recommend-ations (a) and (b) above and also the introduction in England and Walesof the Scottish doctrine of diminished responsibility.3. The Committee suggest that if these recommendations were adopted the effect would be that the death sentence would, be passedonly on those who have committed a heinous crime and the discussion on the desirability of retaining the death penalty would not be confusedwith extraneous disputes.    I do not myself think it is wholly true to saythat if the recommendations of the Committee were adopted the sentence of death could be passed only in really heinous cases, but I have little doubt that the. Committee&apos;s report and the suggestion that the area of disagreement can be narrowed will impress our supporters andparticularly those who are with us on the main issue of retention of the death sentence, but are disturbed about its present scope.    It seems tome, therefore, that while legislation on this subject may expose us to ,
some embarrassment the balance of advantage lies in accepting therecommendations on constructive malice and provocation by words alone and giving as clear an indication in the debate as is possible withoutanticipating The Queen&apos;s Speech that we will introduce legislation in thenext Session.    I do not think that in doing this we should make it moredifficult to adhere to our refusal to implement the recommendations ofthe Royal Commission which we have rejected.    There is wide dis-agreement on what should be done about the M&apos;Naghten Rules;  and onthe question of raising to 21 the age of liability to capital punishment,we can point out not only that the Royal Commission itself was dividedbut that the amount of weight which should be given to youth in assessinga young murderer&apos;s responsibility is eminently a matter for the prerogative rather than for legislation, while the doctrines on which I now propose that we should legislate are primarily a concept of judge-made law and, therefore, can more appropriately be dealt with byamendment of the law than by the exercise of the Prerogative.    TheCommittee&apos;s recommendation on diminished responsibility raises greater difficulties to which I refer later.    The merits of the proposals are discussed in the following paragraph?.Constructive Malice4. The present scope of the doctrine of constructive malice isby no means clear.    At its widest the doctrine means that a man isguilty of murder if he kills while committing a felony or resisting anofficer of justice, even though he had no intention of killing and no reasonto think that his action was likely to cause death or serious injury.    Thepractice of the courts has whittled the doctrine down a good deal, but itcan still produce the result that an act done while committing a felonyor resisting an officer of justice may be murder although if done in other circumstances it would be only manslaughter.    (If the act is done withintention to kill or is such that it would be likely to cause death or serious injury it would be murder whatever the circumstances).    The witnessesbefore the Royal Commission were unanimous in thinking that the ancientrule of constructive malice was objectionable.    There was somedifference of opinion among them on the question whether the doctrine of constructive malice should be retained to a limited extent in order toensure a conviction of murder where a criminal using a firearm killedaccidentally.    The Heald Committee would retain the doctrine where deathresults, albeit accidentally, from the use or threatened use of firearms,explosives or other dangerous weapons.    The Royal Commission thoughtthat the doctrine should be abolished altogether and that its abolitionwould produce no striking change in the practice of the courts.5. In my view the doctrine needs redefining so as to state clearly the classes of case where the death penalty is appropriate and the classes where most people would agree that the sentence of death shouldnot be passed.    For example, there are many who hold that the killing,even accidentally, of a policeman or a citizen who comes to his aid byan armed criminal should be treated as murder and attract the death penalty.    On the other hand accidental killing, e.g. of a woman in thecourse of rape, it is thought should be manslaughter and not murder.6. The Royal Commission recommended that the abolition of the doctrine of constructive malice should be subject to the proviso thataccomplices should remain liable to be convicted oi murder if theprincipal is so liable.    The Heald Committee think that accomplicesshould continue to be liable only if they knew that the principal was armed.This again introduces a difficulty of defiuition: armed with what?    TheRoyal Commission thought that considerations, both of equity and public
protection, demanded the maintenance of the principle that when two ormore persons are parties to a common design for the use of unlawfulviolence and the victim is killed all parties to the design should be liableto the same punishment.    This view seems to me to be preferred to thatof the Heald Committee.7. There is no doctrine of constructive malice in Scottish lawand no question of amending the law in Scotland on this point, therefore,arises.Provocation8,        As the law now stands murder may be reduced to manslaughterif the accused can show  -(a) that he suffered such provocation as might cause a reasonable man to lose his self-control and use violence with fatal results,    and(b) that he was in fact deprived of his self-controland committed the offence while so deprived.It has long been held that insulting or abusive language cannot by itself be sufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter, but it was also held for a considerable period that words conveying information, e,g. a sudden confession of adultery, could be sufficient.    Decisions on this latter point were over-ruled by the House of Lords in the case of Holmecin 1946 when Lord Simon laid down that  &quot;in no case could words alone,save in circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character&quot;reduce murder to manslaughter.9. The Royal Commission recommended and the Heald Committeesupport the recommendation that &quot;where the jury are satisfied that the accused killed the deceased upon provocation, that he was deprived ofhis oelf-control as a result of that provocation and that a reasonable manmight have been so deprived the nature (as distinct from the degree) of theprovocation should be immaterial&quot; (paragraph 151).    There is some doubt whether the Holmes judgment would be followed in the Scottish courts andthe Royal Commission recommended that since it is desirable that the lawon this point should be the same on both sides of the border it should bemade clear that any amendment made in England applied also to Scotland.Diminished responsibility10. The Heald Committee recommend with one dissentient that onthe analogy of Scottish law the jury should be empowered to bring in averdict of manslaughter if they are satisfied that at the time of the offence the person charged, though not insane, was suffering from mentalweakness or abnormality bordering on insanity to such an extent that his responsibility was substantially diminished, and that in such a case the prisoner should be ordered to be detained during Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure.&apos;The Royal Commission rejected the proposal that the Scottish doctrineshould be adopted in England, not because they thought that juries wouldbe too lenient (although they did so think) but because they thought that ifthe doctrine of diminished responsibility was to be adopted at all it ought to be adopted for all offences and that so radical a change ought not to be made merely for the purpose of enabling the court to take account of a special category of mitigating circumstances.    If thequestion was to be considered at all they thought it should be after consideration of the question by a body appointed for that purpose.(Paragraph 413).
11.        In view of the attitude of the Royal Commission the HealdCommitteeTs recommendation on this point raises difficulties which its other recommendations do not, and much fuller consideration wouldbe required before it could be adopted.    I suggest that we should pointout that the Royal Commission rejected this proposal and should do no more than undertake to consider it.Suicide pacts12.        At present if two people agree to commit suicide and onlyone dies the survivor is guilty of murder.    If the survivor has made a genuine attempt to kill himself it is the practice to recommend areprieve.    The Royal Commission considered that if the survivor had himself killed the other party he should be guilty of murder as at present,but recommended that one who only aids, abets or instigates the suicideof another person without killing him should, in future, be guilty of thatoffence and not of murder and should be liable to life imprisonment.13. The Heald Cornmitteers report does not discuss suicidepacts but if the law is being amended the opportunity might be taken to implement this recommendation of the Royal Commission which willsubstantially have the effect of securing by process of the law whatis now secured by the exercise of the Prerogative.14. As suicide is not a crime in Scotland aiding and abetting&apos;suicide is not murder and no corresponding amendment of Scottishlaw is required.Conclusions15.        I recommend  -(l) that the law should be amended in the following respects :-(a) the doctrine of constructive malice should be abolished with the proviso that accomplicesshould continue to be liable to be convicted of murder if the principal is so liable;(b) the doctrine that provocation by words alonecannot, save in the most exceptional circumstances,reduce murder to manslaughter should be abolished;    and(c) aiding and abetting or instigating suicide should cease to be murder and should be punishable bylife imprisonment;(2)   that we should announce in the debate that we acceptthe recommendations of the Royal Commission onthese points and that we will take an early opportunityof introducing legislation to give effect to them andthat we should say that we are giving furtherconsideration to the problem of mental abnormalityand to the suggestion that the Scottish doctrine ofdiminished responsibility should be adopted inEngland;
(3)   that I should indicate, on lines which I proposeto discuss with those of my colleagues principally concerned, that in deciding in particular caseswhether to recommend the exercise of the royal prerogative I shall take into account other matters arising out of the recommendations of the RoyalCommission.G.
