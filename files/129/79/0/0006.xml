lbSECRET Copy No. 4 8CP. (56) 66th January, 1956CABINETREMEMBRANCE SUNDAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Minister for Welsh Affairs and the Secretary ofState for scotland in 1946 consultations took place under the chairmanship of the then HomeSecretary with representatives of the Churches in England and Scotland, of theBritish Legion and of the Departments concerned on the question of the selection of a National Day of Remembrance for both Wars.2. The then Prime Minister announced that His late Majesty King George VIhad approved that Remembrance Sunday, when the dead of both Wars wouldbe honoured, should be celebrated on Sunday, November 11th, or Sunday,November 12th, or if neither of those dates is a Sunday, then the Sunday before november 11th (Official Report, 19th June, 1946, cols. 179-80).3. During the past ten years, Remembrance Sunday was observed on thefirst Sunday in November in 1948, 1949, 1954 and 1955; and on the second Sundayin the other years.4. Early this year the Archbishop of Canterbury suggested that the choice ofthe date should be reconsidered, because the present arrangement interferes in someyears with the observance of All Saints&apos; Tide; also, it gives rise to confusion becausemany people do not understand the rule on which it is fixed. Both Convocationshad asked him to propose that the date should always be the second Sunday inNovember. The same suggestion has been made independently by the Church ofScotland. The effect of the change would be that Remembrance Sunday would bethe Sunday falling between 8th and 14th inclusive (in place of 6th and 12th) andso would never fall on November 6th or November 7th, which are within theoctave of All Saints&apos; Day.5. If the proposal is adopted, the first year in which any change would occurwould be 1960, since the effect of the existing rule would be that RemembranceSunday would be observed in the intervening years on the second Sunday.6. We have ascertained in confidence the views of the leaders of the principalreligious denominations outside the Established Church, and of the leaders of theBritish Legion, because the Legion&apos;s Annual Festival of Remembrance is heldon the Saturday before Remembrance Sunday and is normally attended byThe Queen and other members of the Royal Family. The proposal has met withgeneral approval.7. If the Cabinet agree, we suggest that, subject to any consultations whichmay be required with Commonwealth and Colonial Governments, we should submit for Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure that Remembrance Sunday shall always be observed on the second Sunday in November.G. LL.-G.J. S.5th January, 1956.49377Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1956
