The Government have, however, been advised that it is not possible under the present law of this country to prohibit the manufacture of heroin.There is no similar legal obstacle in the way of prohibiting the export and import of heroin, and the Government have accordingly decided to prohibitentirely as from 1st January, 1956, exports of this drug to countries outsidethe British Isles, and all imports.As regards manufacture, the Government have decided in thelight of the legal advice which they have received and having regard to theviews expressed both in and outside Parliament, that for the present they can best assist in the international objective referred to by restricting the manu-facture of heroin in this country to- the quantities actually required for homemedical consumption and scientific use.G.
