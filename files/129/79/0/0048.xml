SECRET Copy No.   44CP. (56) 4823rd February, 1956CABINETINTERNATIONAL WHEAT agreement memorandum from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food at the meeting of the Cabinet on 13th February I raised orally the question ofthe attitude we should adopt at the talks on the International Wheat Agreement,which began in Geneva yesterday (CM. (56) 12th Conclusions, Minute 5). I am circulating a copy of a minute I sent to the Prime Minister on 14th February about this. The Prime Minister approved the course suggested in it.D. H. A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,21st February, 1956.Prime MinisterINTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENTWhen I reported orally at Cabinet yesterday on the conclusions of theEconomic Policy Committee you asked me to let you have a memorandum on theInternational Wheat Agreement and the reasons for the policy recommended bythe Committee.2. The first International Wheat Agreement came into force on 1st August,1949, after a long period of negotiation between the main exporting and importing countries and expired on 31st July, 1953. The United Kingdom took its full partin the negotiations leading up to the Agreement and joined it with a quotarepresenting a very high percentage of her imported wheat requirements.3. The four years&apos; experience showed that the Agreement had certain important defects and that partly because of this the exporting countries were ableto dominate the Wheat Council set up under the Agreement. This type ofAgreement was conceived in the belief that prices would move freely within the agreed price range. During the whole four-year period of the first Agreement theUnited Kingdom was required to pay the maximum price under the Agreement forvirtually the whole of the wheat she bought under that Agreement.4. When the time came to consider the renewal of the Agreement for a furtherterm the United Kingdom Government took part in the negotiations and soughtwith the assistance of the importing countries to persuade the exporting countries to amend the Agreement in certain important respects with a view to remedyingthe defects which had been shown to exist as a result of the experience of the first four-year period.5. There was however little spirit of accommodation on the part of the exporting countries. Despite this the United Kingdom expressed its willingness totake part in a renewed Agreement with an increase in the minimum price of 35 cents49607Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1956
(from $ 1 - 20 to $ 1 - 55) and an increase in the maximum price of 20 cents (from $ 1 - 80to $2). This was more than generous in view of the steady increase in world wheatstocks which was taking place and which might have involved an increase in theUnited Kingdom&apos;s wheat import bill, largely in the. form of dollars. Even the severy substantial concessions however were insufficient. The exporting countriesinsisted upon a maximum price of $2 - 05 in full knowledge that the United KingdomGovernment would not enter a renewed Agreement at a maximum in excess of $2.The new Agreement therefore came into force on 1st August, 1953, without theUnited Kingdom. The stand made by the United Kingdom Government on thismatter was generally applauded in this country. There was little or no criticism of it and the Opposition did not even raise the question in the House of Commons.6. The second Agreement has now been in force for 2^ years withoutUnited Kingdom membership. It is due to expire on 31st July, 1956, and thequestion of a further renewal has been under active consideration by the countries concerned. For this purpose a conference under United Nations auspices was heldin Geneva in October 1955 and is due to resume again in Geneva on 20th February.7. The United Kingdom Government took part in the October Conferenceon the clear understanding that in doing so it was not committed to rejoining. Itemphasised that any Agreement should make a positive and effective contributionto the solution of the fundamental problem facing the world the continuingproduction of wheat in excess of effective demand and the accumulation of surplusstocks. .8. Unfortunately there was no evidence in Geneva of any intention on thepart of the exporting countries to recast the Agreement in such a form as to makeany impact upon this basic problem.9. Since the decision was taken in 1953 not to rejoin the International wheat agreement, the grain trade and the flour milling industry in this country have beendecontrolled. If the United Kingdom were to rejoin the Agreement it would benecessary to reimpose on the trade a substantial measure of control over theimportation and internal distribution of imported wheat.10. If the Government is to justify to public opinion this major reversal ofour domestic policy it would be necessary to demonstrate conclusively that the new agreement provided a more effective answer to current problems than any other alternative.11. This is not the case. The major problem facing the world in regard towheat to-day is the continuing production in excess of effective demand and the accumulation of surplus stocks. The International Wheat Agreement would make no effective contribution to the solution of this problem for the following reasons: -(a) It contains no provisions which link the disposal of the existing surplusesto the working of the Agreement.(b) It does nothing to discourage the continuance of production in excess of effective demand.(c) It does nothing to encourage increased consumption.(d) Nor are there effective provisions to ensure that prices are allowed to movefreely even within the present price range in accordance with currentconditions of supply and demand.12. All these issues have been considered several times by the economic policy Committee since Christmas. Discussions have been arranged between officials and representatives of the Australian and Canadian Governments to inform them of the development of our ideas and to seek their views.13. There was general agreement by both countries that the present type ofAgreement does not meet the current problem. Nevertheless, they feel, as membersOf the present Agreement, that there is a case for renewal. They argue that withour adherence the present Agreement would have a stabilising psychologicalinfluence on the world wheat market.14. We are satisfied however that the Agreement itself is not the vitalstabilising factor. It is the monopoly selling organisations in the three exporting countries which, with the backing of the Governments concerned, have been able
to hold world wheat prices. These arrangements owe nothing to the existence ofa Wheat Agreement.15. Furthermore, the insistence of some of the exporting countries on maintaining the present minimum price of $1-55 for a renewed Agreement showsthat there is no possibility of negotiating any price provision which would make animpact upon the surplus problem. A price of this level is quite unrealistic into-day&apos;s supply conditions. But any serious attempt to negotiate a more realisticminimum price and still more to make that the effective price would lead to abitter wrangle with the Canadians without any prospect of agreement.16. Both the Canadians and Australians emphasise the need for a frankstatement from the United Kingdom. Nothing would do us more harm with the canadians and the Australians than to seek to escape from the Agreement by insisting on conditions which we know from the outset would be unacceptable. Ibelieve that Mr. Howe told you that if, as was apparent, we did not intend to rejointhe International Wheat Agreement he thought it preferable for us to say so outrightand save time in discussion.17. When the Economic Policy Committee met yesterday it had before it areport on the discussions with the Canadians and the Australians. The Committeereached the conclusion that our right course was to decline to readhere to anAgreement of the present type. They felt however that we should make a determined effort at Geneva to persuade the exporting countries and otherimporting countries to face the real problem. It cannot be solved by a continuation of what is no more than a multilateral commercial Agreement what is needed isan Agreement by Governments to amend their wheat policies in such a way as toremove the threat to order and stability which is implicit in the present situation.18. We propose therefore to suggest at Geneva that the International wheat council should in future fill a dual role. It would continue to manage anInternational Wheat Agreement of the present type for such countries as chose totake part in such an Agreement. But it would also provide a standing forum for therealistic discussion of international wheat problems in general including the evolution of a set of internationally agreed rules in regard to the disposal of thepresent surplus and of policies designed to bring wheat production into line withdemand and so to prevent the accumulation of further surpluses.19. I believe that it is no more than our international duty as the biggestimporting country in the world to make this attempt to resolve the serious problem which faces the world in this matter and I do not despair of success.20. The Economic Policy Committee agreed yesterday that we should announce at the first session of the resumed Conference on 20th February our decision not to readhere to an Agreement of the present type and to put forward as a constructive proposal our conception of the International Wheat Council as a world forum for the discussion of international wheat problems and to indicate our willingness to participate fully in its discussions.21.   I recommend that you should approve these conclusions.22. I am sending copies of this minute to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, and the President of the Board of Trade.D. HEATHCOAT AMORY.Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,14th February, 1956.
