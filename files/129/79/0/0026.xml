confidential.P. (56) 26 COPY NO.    iJ-L28th January, 1956CABINETDANISH BACONMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and food am anxious that my colleagues should appreciate fully thereasons why I seek to end state trading in imported bacon.     This is nota matter of dogma.    True, I should find it difficult to explain why Ikeep on doing for bacon what I have ceased doing for everything else.I coirdd hardly say that it was in order to restrict imports since we have always assured the Danes, our own public and the O0E.E,C that ourState trading is not restrictive.    Nor has it been to date.   Imports from poland are, of course, under a bilateral trade agreement,2.      I should also be in some embarrassment in explaining how long we intend to go on.    State trading in bacon causes uncertainty tothe trade.     They know that this is contrary to our declared policy andwill continually expect ns to bring the arrangement   to an end.    If, as has been suggested, we were to contemplate afurther lengthy period ofState trading I should have thought that our chances of getting a tariffeventually, after withdrawing the proposal we have already pressedupon the Danes, would be considerably reduced, if not sacrificedaltogether.3.      But, above all, we must be under no illusion about the effectof State trading on the liability of the Exchequer under the guarantee arrangements for home production.    I would certainly not claim that a10 per cent tariff provides absolute protection to the Exchequer.    ButState trading, so far from providing a better safeguard for the exchequer is much less effective in sustaining the market and thereby affordingsome relief than a free flow of trade would be,4.      In paragraph 4 of C,P0(56) 25 it is argued that the tariff wouldnot prevent the Danes from flooding the market  &quot;if they should attemptto maximise their profits by cutting prices and increasing the volumeof their sales&quot;.    But we know from experience that a very smalladditional supply of bacon can have a disproportionate effect on jjrice;and so far from maximising their profits the Danes would suffer heavy losses if they started to &quot;flood&quot; the market,     (Eggs are rather similar,;and the Danes have been most careful since State-trading ended, notto bring down the market here).5.      At the moment, we guarantee them a fixed quantity for theyear at a price which does not involve them in a loss.    We then haveto make sure that in selling bacon we do not bring down the market,thus making a trading loss and, incidentally, increasing the Exchequer
liability.    Bat we cannot be sure of succeeding.    There have been long periods during which we have been making a. loss.    We have been lucky sofar during the current contract year but, even so, the maximum profitwe can make under this contract is 13/- or 19/-;   the rest of the 30/-difference between 270/-, when the Danes start taking an extra profit,and 240/-, the minimum guaranteed to them, represents freight andhandling costs.    With a tariff we should at least be certain of a 10 per centrevenue to offset against the subsidy.6.      We have, of course, no direct control over home production ofbacon, though we can influence the long-term trend of pig productiongenerally.     We can do nothing about its flow over so short a period asa yeai*;  we cannot control demand;   and even when we fix the quantityto be imported over the year we have in practice limited control over the weekly arrivals.     Thus, the market can get seriously glutted at times,bringing down the price and pushing up the subsidy whatever we do aboutthe imports.7.      Of course, we try to influence the situation as best we can byinfluencing imports.    We have resorted in the past to the most fancifulexpedients:  paying the Danes and the Dutch not to ship us bacon but to turn it into pork for their own market or for export elsewhere;  holdingbacon in stock and risking the odium of having to release what is thendescribed as &quot;stale&quot; baccn;  importing the contract quantities in the formof pork and risking the loss of money on the pork market, as well as, bypushing that market down, raising the subsidy.8.      My experience convinces me that when we are in the trade the risks to the market, and, therefore, to the Exchequer, are much greaterthan they would be if the producers in Denmark, the exporters, theimporters, the wholesalers, and the retailers had to carry that riskthemselves.    Indeed, it is precisely because they do not want to have therisk that the Danish producers would very much like us to continue to bethe sole importers.    When the trade is free, it is in everybodyfs interestto avoid the market staying glutted for long because they lose money.When we are the sole importers, they are perfectly content to leave us tohold the baby.9.      Apart from these economic considerations, I find the political disadvantages of being &quot;half in, half out&quot; intolerable.    We are constantlyexposed to attacks from our own farmers who, every time they find themarket weak, blame &quot;the flood of imports&quot;;   from the Fatstock MarketingCorporation, whose Chairman says   &quot;the Government can lay us flat onour backs any moment they choose&quot;;   from the trade which is never content with what we do, saying that we sometimes import too much,  sometimestoo little, that we hold the market up too long or push it down too far.There has also been quite a flood of questions in the House of commons on bacon imports, in striking contrast to meat generally where peoplenow accept the position that we are out of the trade and, therefore, lesseasy to blame for what happens.10.     In short, I am quite clear in my own mind that this position ofresponsibility without adequate power (which we could only have if we re-introduced the whole apparatus of control) ought not to go on a minutelonger than we can help.    State trading involves u&amp; in heavy risks and provides no more than limited protection for the Exchequer.    But limitedprotection can be secured through a tariff and in practice any &quot;flood&quot; of pigs is likely to be short-lived.    If the case for a tariff which has been
put to the Danes is now withdrawn, it can never be made effectivelyagain.D, H. A S ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries It Food,S.W.I.28th January, 1956.
