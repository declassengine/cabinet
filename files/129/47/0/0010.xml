is  document  is  the  property   of  his   britannic   majestvs  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (51) 2351th August, 1951CABINETGERMAN  DEBT settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my memorandum of 24th May (CP. (51) 139) on the German Debt Settle-ment, I circulated to the Cabinet copies of documents which, in agreement withthe Governments of France and the United States, were being sent to a numberof other Governments and to private creditor groups with an interest in the settle-ment of German external debts. These documents, which were distributed on24th May, were intended to form the basis for consultations during the Summer bythe Tripartite Commission on German Debts, which had been set up to representthe three Governments, with the German Federal Government and with creditorinterests in France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The consultations,which were to deal with Germany&apos;s pre-war debts, were planned to facilitate theexchange of views and the exploration of the various issues in preparation for afull conference in the Autumn with representatives of all countries with a significantinterest as pre-war creditors of Germany. My colleagues may wish to know what steps in this procedure have so far been taken.2. In accordance with the arrangements outlined in the documents, and after some preliminary exchanges of views in Bonn at the beginning of June with a delegation of the German Federal Government, the Tripartite Commission on german Debts has held a series of meetings in London.3. In the first place, from 25th June to 3rd July, the Tripartite Commissionheld preliminary meetings with representatives of creditors from the UnitedKingdom, France and the United States in the presence of observers appointed bythe Governments of the four other countries with a major creditor interest, namely,Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. These meetings with creditorsonly served to clarify the issues which required discussion and to enable the differentcreditor groups to make contact with each other and to reach a considerable measure of mutual understanding.4. Then, between 5th July and 17th July, a preliminary conference on german Pre-war Debts took place, at which the Tripartite Commission receiveda delegation of the German Federal Government and representatives of theGerman debtors, as well as representatives of the creditors and the observersalready referred to. The conference adopted, with little modification, an Agendadrawn up by the Tripartite Commission and organised itself in a series of Com-mittees to study the points on this Agenda on which papers had been prepared bythe Tripartite Commission. A copy of this Agenda is attached as an Annex. Inthese Committees representatives of the Tripartite Commission, of the german delegation and of the creditors were able to get a clearer understanding of thescale of the various kinds of German pre-war external debts, to narrow downsomewhat the issues on which decisions will be needed at a later stage, and toproduce agreed papers describing these issues and in some cases setting out thepreliminary views of the creditors and of the German Delegation on the solutionsto be found.5.   This conference was intended to be of an exploratory character only, andit can be regarded as having fulfilled its purpose.   It has brought into the open thepoints on which the main difficulties will arise in negotiating a settlement plan,41042
and by doing so has facilitated the task of the Tripartite Commission in preparing for the full conference in the Autumn at which many other countries will berepresented. The Tripartite Commission is now engaged in considering the resultsof these preliminary meetings and in preparing for the Autumn conference, thedate of which will probably be in early November. Its aim in doing so is toensure so far as possible that the settlement plan which will be worked out in thecourse of the Autumn conference will be consistent with the general principlesaiready laid down by the three Governments. The main elements in these principlesare that the plan should contribute to the normalisation of economic relationsbetween Germany and other countries, that it should provide fair and equitabletreatment of the various interests affected, and that it should not dislocate theGerman economy or add appreciably to the financial burden on any occupying power.6. In addition, I should like my colleagues to be aware of two other questionswhich, though not on the Agenda of the recent conference, nevertheless, I under-stand, occupied an important position in the thoughts of some of the delegates,and in the case of the first of the two questions necessitated a good deal ofdiscussion.(a) Treatment of German External Assets ;In accordance with the Paris Agreement on Reparation from germany of December 1945&apos; and other intergovernmental agreements flowing from it,former German assets in Allied countries and in a number of neutral countries have been or are being liquidated and the proceeds dealt with in accordancewith decisions of the Allied Governments concerned. The German delegation to the recent conference made it plain that the German Federal government wished to bring the question of the treatment of these assets, and also possiblyof assets removed from Germany under the dismantling programme, into thediscussions on the debt settlement. Its aim appeared to be to link the twosubjects in such a way as to reduce by some method, the nature of which was never made clear, the amount of the outstanding debts which had to be dealtwith. The Tripartite Commission, while admitting that the loss of Germanexternal assets might affect in some degree Germany&apos;s future capacity to makepayment on its external debts, firmly refused to discuss the principle of thetreatment of these assets, which, it emphasised, had already been settled by the relevant intergovernmental Agreements and was outside their terms of refer-ence. The matter was not taken further at the conference, but it is probablethat the German Federal Government will raise it again at a later stage.(b) The settlement of Germany&apos;s debts to the Allied Governments for economic assistance furnished since the warThe amounts claimed by the three Governments have been communicatedto the German Delegation, but as the London Conference was concerned only with pre-war debts there has not so far been any discussion with the german delegation about the arrangements to be made for settling the post-war debts.The German Delegation pointed out that the nature of these arrangements must clearly affect any German proposals which might be made in regard to pre-war debts and urged that there should be discussions on the post-war debts beforethe Autumn Conference. It is the intention of the Tripartite Commission thatthere should be such discussions, but before they can be held the three Govern-ments will have to agree on the settlement arrangements, for the post-war debtswhich they would be prepared to accept. The problem involved is nowbeing studied with a view to its being submitted to my colleagues in due course.H M.1th August, 1951.
