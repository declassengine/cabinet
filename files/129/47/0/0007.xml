DOG^ME^-J^-THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic- MA JES TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)26SECRET ** &quot;C.P.(51) 232 COPY NO.   *?&quot; 127TH JULY, 1951CABINETREPORT OF BROADCASTING committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Postmaster-general at their meeting on 19th July (CM. (51) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 2)our colleagues invited us to make it plain in the debate on the broadcasting committee&apos;s Report that, before reaching final decisions on the recom-mendations of that Committee, the Government would be prepared to take into account the views expressed in debate.2. On the main essentials we recommend that there should be nochange from the proposals set out in the White Paper (Cmd. 8291):-(a) The British Broadcasting Corporation should be continued as theauthority responsible for all broadcasting in the United Kingdom on substantially the present basis, i. e. the monopoly should continue.(b) The prohibition of any commercial advertisement or sponsoredprogramme without the written consent of the Postmaster-General should be repeated.(c) The charter should be renewed for a term of fifteen years.There was some criticism of each of these proposals, but little that was new,and we are not inclined to attach any undue weight to it.3. The debate in the main concentrated on the two issues of:-(a) The percentage of the net licence revenue that the B.B. C. shouldreceive for the next three years,(b) The constitution of Broadcasting Councils in Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland.4, Our colleagues will recall that we originally asked them to agreethat the whole of the net licence revenue should be paid to the B.B. C. for threeyears.   The Cabinet decided, however (CM. (51) 49th Conclusions, Minute 4,Conclusion (3)), that the B. B. C. should receive 85%.   We doubt whether anyslight concession, e, g, an increase to 90%, would materially reduce criticism and it would tend to weaken the Governments case.   The arguments for 85% arestrong and we recommend that no concession should be made.5. On the second point, criticism of our proposals for the constitutionof Broadcasting Councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was fairlywidespread and was based primarily on the possible introduction of politicsinto broadcasting and on the unsuitability of local authorities for the sort oftask involved.-1-
6. Some concession may be felt to be necessary.   One course would beto accept the recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee in toto.We feel, however, as we explained in C.P.(5l) 183, that there are grave objections to their proposals for a Commission of five persons to beappointed and paid by the Government.   In effect this would mean the settingup of separate corporations, with the attendant accentuation of all thedifficulties of divided loyalties and overlapping authority which will be present in some degree in any scheme of extraneous control.   We fearalso that owing to inevitable and embarrassing pressures nationalist elementswould tend to be over-represented on these small Commissions and would themselves be exposed to continuous nationalist pressure.7. Our proposals for the constitution of Broadcasting Councils were accordingly designed to ensure that tire Councils should be large, that theircomposition should be automatic, and representative of all the people in thenational region, and be completely independent of the B. B. C. and/or theGovernment of the day.   So composed, they would have been able to exercise a general influence on their Home Programmes without the danger of inter-ference inherent in a small body exercising detailed continuous control, andwould have been relatively free from nationalist pressure.   Our colleagues willrecall, however, that when we suggested that the members of the councils should be drawn from local authorities we did not propose that councils should have the direct and autonomous powers that are now to be theirs.The executive powers accorded to the Councils in the White Paper givecolour to the criticisms advanced in the Debate that politics would, under our plan, enter into regional broadcasting.   We do not suggest that it is practicable at this stage to go back on the White Paper statement of the powersto be given to Councils.8. The ideal solution should, we think, conform to the requirementsthat the Councils should be large (e.g. 25 members) and constituted auto-matically.   We can see no way of attaining this other than appointment fromthe major local authorities.   If it is felt to be impossible to adhere to thatplan there is little choice other than:-(a) appointment by Government at its complete discretion of, say,25 members;(b) appointment by Government at its discretion of, say, 25 persons drawnlargely from representative bodies (e. g. local authorities,churches, universities) without any binding commitment as to the bodies to be represented;(c) appointment by Government of persons nominated by representative bodies.Course (a) may be felt to be too great a departure from the White Paperproposal.   Course (c) has attractions but it would be difficult to draw up ascheme satisfactory to all bodies which might claim rights to be represented.Course (b) gives considerable elasticity while importing the idea that theCouncil will be representative of wider interests and appears to be themost acceptable alternative.9. The powers of the Broadcasting Councils outlined in the Debatedid not come in for any serious criticism. They go some way to avoid too great fragmentation of the Corporation and we propose that they should beretained.   They are that the Broadcasting Councils:-(i)  should control the policy and content of their Home Programmes;
(ii)  should be subject to the duties and obligations of the B. B. C. set outin the Charter and Licence;(iii)  should be bound by the agreed arrangements for party political broadcasts.(iv)  should be advisory in matters of finance and capital development;(v)  should be responsible for the appointment of the staff whollyemployed on their Home Programmes, but the contracts of serviceof the staff should be with the B.B.C.   (The Regional Controllerswould continue to be appointed by the B. B. C.).10, The proposals in the White Paper regarding the Advisory Councilsfor the English Regions were not attacked and we suggest no alteration.We consider it desirable, however, that the first periodical review of theB.B.C. should consider how effectively the Corporation has carried outthe recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee that these councils should be made more representative.11. We do not think that there is any need to issue a further white paper giving the Governmenfs decision on these matters.   It may be convenient to arrange for a Question to be asked when the House resumes so as to enablethe Governmenfs decision to be made public and thus test the reaction ofMembers prior to the publication of the draft Charter and the Licence.12. We ask our colleagues:-(i) to agree that no concession should be made on the proposal to paythe B.B. C. 85% of the net licence revenue for three years,(ii)  to decide (a,) whether the proposals for constituting broadcasting councils set out in the White Paper are to be adhered to or(b) if not, whether the Councils should be constituted by theappointment by the Government at its discretion of, say, 25persons drawn largely from representative bodies without anybinding commitment as to the bodies to be represented.(iii) to agree that the Broadcasting Councils should have the powers setout in paragraph 9 above.P.C.G.
