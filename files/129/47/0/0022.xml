C.P. (51) 247 COPY NO.14TH SEPTEMBER, 1951CABINETTHE MANNING OF THE CIVIL DEFENCE CORPSAND FIRE service memorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for ScotlandInterdepartmental discussions between the Ministry of Labour andrational Service, the Home Office, the Scottish Home Department and otherDepartments have been taking place for some months about the whole-timeman-power which would be required in war for the Rescue and PioneerSections of the Civil Defence Corps, and for the Fire Service (additional tothe peace-time strength of the Fire Brigades).   These discussions have now reached a point where guidance on broad policy is required from Ministers.2. The requirements of whole-time man-power are roughly estimated by the Home Office and Scottish Home Department at 200,000 men in thecase of the Rescue and Pioneer Sections of the Civil Defence Corps and 175,000men in the case of the Fire Service.   These figures do not purport to beprecise estimates and, in any case, the actual figures would depend, among other things, on factors which are at present uncertain, e.g., on the date whenthe men will be required and the equipment which could be made availablefor them by that date.   For planning purposes, however, they are regardedas reasonable estimates of the order of magnitude of the man-power required.3. To meet these requirements, the Civil Defence Services have notrained reserves corresponding to either the Regular Reserves of the armed forces (including National Servicemen), the Territorial Army and otherVolunteer Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, or to Class &apos;Z&apos; and equivalentReserves.   Recruitment for Civil Defence and the Fire Service is at presentproceeding on the basis of part-time commitments both in war and in peace,and the number of men enrolled, even on this basis, is only some 15,000in the case of the Rescue and Pioneer Sections of the Civil Defence Corps andsome 7,500 in the case of the Auxiliary Fire Service.4. Obviously, the ideal plan from the point of view of the rome Officeand Scottish Home Department would be to fix a target date by which an agreed number of trained men should be available for call-up on the same basis as the Reserves of the Armed Forces.   To achieve this object in any reasonable time or on the basis of anything like the figures indicated inparagraph 2 would be wholly impracticable within the framework of currentDefence policy and even to build up Reserves on a smaller scale and on a lower standard of training would necessitate a great intensification of effort in the way of provision of facilities for training in peace-time.   It is no part of the purpose of this paper to suggest any revision of decisions recently &apos;OCUMIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S-GOVERNMENT)SECRET
taken by the Cabinet as to the scale on which Civil Defence preparations should proceed, and it is recognised by the Home Office and scottish home Department that it is their responsibility to develop their organi-sation for the purpose of providing Civil Defence and Fire Service Reserveswithin the limits of policy as it stands.5. It would, however, be unrealistic and uneconomical to embark upon plans for expanding existing training facilities in order to cater forthe intake and training of large numbers of Reservists unless preparationsare made at the same time to ensure that, at the opportune time, thereshould be a flow of recruits at a rate proportionate to the capacity of thefacilities thus provided.   It is, therefore, essential at an early stage thatconcurrent examination should be made of this problem.6. It is highly desirable on every ground that the numbers required shouldbe obtained on a voluntary basis, and it is agreed that the rome Office and scottish Home Department should, as soon as they are ready (i. e. , whenthey are in a position to give, at any rate broadly, an indication to volunteersof what would be their conditions of service in war), launch and press withthe utmost vigour a campaign designed to secure both from those who havealready enrolled on a partHime basis, and from other sources, as manyvolunteers for whole-time service in war as possible.   There is, however,nothing in past experience to justify the hope that anything like sufficient numbers are likely to be obtainable in this way, or that those obtainablewill be obtainable at the right times or in the right places.   There can be nodoubt that the only way of obtaining satisfactory results would be by theintroduction of a measure of compulsion in peace-time and the Cabinet areinvited to consider whether provisional preparations for doing so should nowbe made or whether we must accept the inescapable alternative that these services will not be adequately manned at the outbreak of war.   The detailsof any measure of compulsion would require careful study.   Its main objective should be to secure that an appropriate number of men areregistered in a Reserve with obligations of immediate call-up in the eventof war in the same way as in the case of the Armed Forces;  the actualnumbers to be called up would be regulated according to the facilities available for handling them.   Th&quot;? two main questions which would ariseare:-(a) what classes or groups of men should be made liable for compulsoryenrolment;  and(b) what, if any, liability for training in peace-time should be imposedupon them?Both these are questions which need further examination in detail, butbroadly it is contemplated that this examination should be based on thefollowing principles(a)       &quot;Without excluding the possibility of obtaining a proportion of therequirements either by way of a percentage of the annual intakes of national servicemen or by imposing obligations upon older men who had experienceof civil defence or fire service in the last war, main reliance should beplaced upon the call-up of young men in their age groups, starting at age 25and excluding from the field Regular Reservists (including National Servicemenduring their period of part-time service), members of the Territorial Armyand other Volunteer Reserves and Auxiliary Forces, &quot;Z&quot; Reservists selectedand available for recall, and men who ought to be reserved for Industry;  the
obligation in war would be to serve in Civil Defence for a limited period,until they were required  and could be made available  for call-up to the armed Forces, which meanwhile would have sole call upon men up to age 25.(b)       There should be a limited period of annual training;  it wouldnot be possible to fix this so high as to provide that all Reservists were fully trained in peace-time (it is estimated that for this purpose a periodof continuous training of six weeks would be required), but consideration should be given to the possibility of varying training periods for different parts of the country,designed, e. g, , to secure that special provision couldbe made for the case of London,7. The Minister of Labour and National Service is in general agreementwith this paper.8. The Cabinet is accordingly invited -(i)  to note that without compulsory enrolment and training in peace-timethe Qvil Defence Services cannot be ready to operate at theoutbreak of a war;  and(ii)  to decide whether a 3ill should be prepared to confer the powersnecessary for the purposes indicated in paragraph 6, on the under-standing that it would be held in reserve until a decision can betaken on the practicability of introducing compulsion in peace-time.HMcN14TH SEPTEMBER, 1951.
