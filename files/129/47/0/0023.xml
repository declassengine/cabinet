)OCUMENT- IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC -MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (51) 24814TH SEPTEMBER, 1951OOP    NO.A 3 INS TMAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS OF THE POLICE AT the outset OF ANY MAJOR war memorandum by the I-ome Secretary and theSecretary of State for ScotlandThis paper, prepared in consultation with the Ministry of Labour, iscomplementary to our paper setting out the needs of the Qvil defence services for trained men required for whole-time service from the outset of a major war.2. In order to discharge the additional war-time tasks which fall to thepolice, it is estimated that police forces will require an increase of50% over their peace-time establishment of approximately 80,000 men;the war-time male police establishment has therefore been fixed at 120,000.The present male strength of police forces in England, Wales and scotland is approximately 67,800 but account must be taken of the numbers of reservists of the Armed Forces in the police who will be required to returnto the Fighting Services on the outbreak of war.   The numbers of men required to bring the police up to full strength in war fluctuates according to current police strength, and the numbers of reservists, but it is of the orderof 5 5,000 to 60,000.   In addition 1,000 women will be required for full-timepolice duty.3.        As regards part-time man-power, it is considered that it will not benecessary to expand the peace-time cadre of the Special Constabulary;the maximum strength authorised for the Special Constabulary in peace-time is approximately 160,000.   The present strength of the Special Constabularyin Great Britain is 76,000, so that the police would need to recruit a further84,000 Special Constables in order to reach their maximum peace-timestrength.   In addition there would be a need for a small number of womenSpecial Constables.j   4. During the last war a certain number of conscripts elected toserve in the police.   The experiment was not altogether a happy one and showed that, although some conscripts exercised police powers satisfactorily,I   as a general rule it was undesirable to entrust to conscripts the extensivea powers affecting the genera! public which appointment as a policeman confers,J Apart from this, policemen work very largely as individuals and must be trusted to do their jobs honestly and conscientiously:  an unwilling conscriptwould be virtually useless.   In the circumstances, the measures proposedto recruit men for the Qvil Defence Corps and the Fire Service by means of conscription should not, it is felt, be extended to the police service inpeace-time, even though conscription for the police in war-time might haveto be considered as a last resort.
5. It appears therefore that for the time being reliance shotiidcontinue to be placed on the volunteer system to obtain the additionalman-power required for the police.   In view of the presumed nature ofa future war, it is desirable to obtain and train such volunteers priorto active hostilities;  apart from the Qvil Defence considerations which make this necessary for the Qvil Defence Corps and the Fire Service, thepolice have in addition to their Qvil Defence tasks special responsibilitiesat the beginning of war, such as the control of aliens.   The existingtraining facilities are estimated to be capable of training all volunteerslikely to be forthcoming.60 In order to stimulate voluntary recruitment, it is desirable to place the minimum restrictions both on candidates for the Special Constabularyand on men prepared to give full-time service in war,   Prior to theDefence Cbmmittee&apos;s decision of 27th July, 1949 (D, O. (49) 18th Meeting,Minute 5) there was no restriction on the recruitment of Special Constablesother than a minimum age limit of 18 and the necessity for a candidatesatisfying the necesrary standards as to height, fitness, integrity, nationality and education.   In view of the complete reliance which must be placed on voluntary recruitment for the police it is desirable that any suitable(on pre-July 1949 standards) volunteer, either for part-time service or full-time duty, should be permitted to enrol, provided that the candidate is neithera reservist whom the Service Departments require for mobilisation in theearly months of an emergency, nor engaged in a full-time civilian callingessential to the war effort.7. The following proposals are therefore put forward for the field of recruitment for men prepared to undertake full-time police service in war:-(i)   Men between 25 and 50, other than those in the Armed Forces orthe Territorial or Auxiliary Forces, including the Mtional ServiceReserve, or those in vital occupations;(ii)   &quot;L&quot; or equivalent reservists, other than those selected for earlyrecall by the Service Departments or in vital occupations;(iii)   Retired Officers recruited with the prior approval of the appropriateService Department.8. The field for recruitment for part-time service in the special constabulary should be similar, except that a vital civilian occupationwould not debar &quot;spare time&quot; service as a Special Constable.J.
