IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF&apos; HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMEJPrinted for the Cabinet  October 1951CONFIDENTIALCopyCP. (51) 26726th October, 1951CABINETCUSTODY OF CABINET DOCUMENTSNote by the Prime MinisterIt is a well-established and useful rule that members of the Government in officemay not have access to the Cabinet papers of earlier Governments save by agree-rnent between the two Prime Ministers concerned. To assist in securing compliancewith this rule in the immediate future, I ask that all Ministers should forthwithreturn to the Cabinet Office all copies now held by them of (i) papers and minutesof the Cabinet itself, and (ii) papers and minutes of all Ministerial Cabinet Com-mittees and other Ministerial Meetings except the following:-Civil Defence CommitteeCommonwealth Affairs CommitteeOverseas Reconstruction CommitteeChina and South-East Asia CommitteeLord Presidents (Accommodation) Committee.The papers of the Committees listed above may be excepted from the general ruleand left in the possession of Departments, since they contain little material which islikely to be the subject of political controversy.2. I ask that Ministers should not take away with them, on relinquishingoffice, any Cabinet papers whether papers of the Cabinet itself, or of CabinetCommittees or Meetings of Ministers. This request applies to the papers which;a Minister submitted himself as well as to papers submitted by other Ministers.I am satisfied that under modern conditions general compliance with thisrequest is necessary for the purpose of ensuring the safe custody of Cabinet docu-ments. Any former Minister may at any time have access in the Cabinet Officeto copies of Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers issued to him while he was inoffice; and the services of the Secretary of the Cabinet and his staff will continueto be available to former Ministers for this purpose.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.WA,26th October, 1951.
