Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1951SECRET Copy 1CP. (51) 2625th October, 1951CABINETNo.  31MAN-POWER: MEASURES TO DEAL WITH LABOUR supply memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. summary the aim of this memorandum is to review briefly our man-power situationand to propose measures for allocating to defence, export, and other essentialproduction and services the supplies of labour to be released as a result of proposals at present under consideration and from other sources.2.   The facts of the situation are (a) we are faced with an additional demand of between 500,000 and 600,000workers for defence, His Majesty&apos;s Forces, and essential industries and services, and this at a time when the general pressure of demand for labour is very high;(b) we must hope towards the end of the period for some decrease in thenumbers unemployed when the re-deployment of labour is complete andwe may hope for some increase in the total working population whichmay range between 200,000-300,000;(c) there should also be some easement in the competitive demand from less essential manufacture when raw material shortages begin to take effect,and if public feeling is aroused some increase in voluntary movement from less essential employment to defence, export and other essentialproduction;(d) the incidence of the demand falls unevenly between different parts of thecountry and thus intensifies the difficulty of ensuring that all theresources of labour available can be concentrated to meet the essentialdemands;(e) no mere arithmetical closing of the gap will solve the labour supply-problem.3. The measures already taken are not sufficient to deal with the situation andit is essential that less essential production should be cut. On the assumption thatthis will be done by means of production controls, I propose (1) the revival on a limited scale of a system of labour supply inspection toexamine the use made by employers of their labour, particularly skilled workers;(2) that approval should be given to the opening of negotiations with theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress witha view to introducing a Regulation of Engagement Order under whichthe employer would have a legal obligation placed upon him not toobtain his workers otherwise than through an Employment Exchange.The main object of this Order would be to make all workers seekingemployment come to the Employment Exchange where they would beinformed of the important vacancies and persuasion, not compulsion,used to get them to take these vacancies.41312 b
II. The Present Position4. Our total working population has been increasing in recent years and isnow greater than at any other date in peacetime. As is shown in the table below,there are now nearly 1 million more persons in the working population comparedwith 1939. In addition, the numbers registered as unemployed are over 1 million less than in 1939. There are, therefore, 2 million more persons in civil employment or in the Forces compared with pre-war.Broad Changes in Distribution of Man-power between tnid-\939 and mid-\95\(Thousands)Increases  Decreases Metals, engineering and vehicles    4-900  Distributive trades      ......   -400Public administration ...   4-725   Textiles and clothing   ...      ...   -150Basic  industries  and  services Other services   ...      ...      ...   - 50(excluding mining)   ...      ...   -f 400  Coalmining      ......      ...   - 25Chemicals        ...      ...      ...   4-125   Other mining and quarrying  ...   - 25Other manufacturing industries(excluding      textiles      and clothing)       .........   4-125Building and contracting       ...    4- 50Civil employment   ............ 4-1,675Registered unemployment......... -1,075His Majesty&apos;s Forces (including those onrelease leave)    ............ 4-  350Total working population     ...      ...      4- 9505. In spite of the increased numbers at work, the total of vacancies notified to Employment Exchanges which were outstanding at 1st August, was 489,000(the highest August figure since 1947) compared with 380,000 a year ago. Duringthe first seven months of this year, the number of outstanding vacancies increasedby 142,000; in the corresponding period last year the increase was only 34,000. Inthe engineering industries, which are the ones most affected by rearmament,although the number of workers has increased by about 100,000 in the last twelvemonths, outstanding vacancies have also increased by 34,000 to a total of 105,000.6. Outstanding First Preference vacancies* in work identified as part of thedefence programme increased from 9,700 at 20th December, 1950, to 25,800 at1st August. 73,000 other First Preference vacancies mainly concerned with export industries and essential services, were outstanding at the latter date. In the four weeks preceding 1st August, it was only possible to fill 3,100 defence programmevacancies and 15,700 other First Preference vacancies. During the first seven months of 1951, placings in defence vacancies had doubled, but outstanding defencevacancies have nearly trebled. In the same period other First Preference placingsincreased only slightly, but outstanding vacancies rose by two-fifths.* 7. One of the most serious labour shortages affecting the programme, par-ticularly at present, is that of skilled engineering workers. The number of out-standing vacancies in the principal skilled engineering occupations increased from16,000 to 36,000 in the last twelve months; 13,000 of this increase of 20,000 tookplace in the last six months. During the same period the comparatively small number of wholly unemployed men in these occupations fell from 4,400 at August1950 to 3,600 at end-1950 and again to 2,000 at August 1951.8. Over the next two years or so the number of workers engaged on thedefence programme, which has increased by some 200,000 in the last twelve months,will, according to estimates made by the Ministry of Supply, need to be further increased by something between 400,000 and 500,000; of this increase, about 120,000will be required between mid-1951 and March 1952, and a further 280,000 by march 1953. In addition, an increase of some 75,000 is required in the strengthof His Majesty&apos;s Forces during the next two years.   So far as exports are concerned* First Preference vacancies are those identified as being connected with work which is of thehighest national importance, i.e., certain named industries and services, e.g., agriculture, coalmining,cottonspinning, iron and steel, electrical generating plant, railway operating service and vacancies on defence or export work.
the problem is mainly one of maintaining existing labour forces, but any substantial increase in exports in any industry might change that situation. There are in addi-tion the outstanding demands for basic industries and services such as coal mines and transport. These are smaller in numbers but they are both difficult to fill and as their description indicates of basic importance to the whole defence and export programme. The demand for additional workers may, therefore, be in the region of 500,000; this includes a proportion, which cannot be estimated, of workers whowill not be required to move from one factory to another, since their switch to defence production will take place inside the works.9. On the other side of the balance sheet we have to consider the followingpossible sources of labour supply (a) a reduction in unemployment,(b) any further increase in the total working population, and(c) any diminution of demand in or movement of labour from other industries and services otherwise than as a result of proposals to cut down less essential production.10. First, the level of unemployment in the two months of July and Augustwas lower than at any time since 1945, and it is unlikely that the level of unemploy-ment at mid-1953 will fall much, if at all, below 150,000 compared with the figureof 186,000 in July 1951.11. Second, so far as the total working population is concerned, there hasbeen an average increase of 140,000 per year over the past three years. Thisconsists mainly of persons postponing retirement, pensioners returning to workand married women not normally working. It would be unwise to count on a continuing increase in the total working population at the rate of the last two orthree years.12. The third question is the possibility of a diminution of current demand and a movement of labour from less essential industries and services resulting fromcauses other than specific production cuts. The main cause for these would be the expected but long delayed effects of raw material shortages and of the end-usecontrols already put into operation. There may also be some increased voluntarymovement towards important work on the part of individual workers if the publicis given a strong enough lead and sense of urgency. A climate of opinion of thiskind would assist the work of my Local Offices in influencing the choice of workers who would, under the proposals contained in Part IV, be required to come to theExchanges in the course of normal turnover in order to obtain fresh employmentthough it is unlikely to influence their choice unless the conditions of employmentof the work in question also compare reasonably well.13. An examination of national figures only is misleading because demand and supply vary in intensity in different parts of the country. It is accordinglynecessary to examine the incidence of the defence programme as between thedifferent Regions in order to obtain a full appreciation of the nature and magnitude of the labour problems involved.14. In the first place, unemployment is still spread unevenly over the country.Although the rate for Great Britain is 1 0 per cent., it varies between Regionsfrom 0-3 per cent, in the North Midland Regions to 2-1 and 2-3 per cent, inScotland and Wales, and there are some districts which still have fair-sized pocketsof unemployment, e.g., the Development Areas at Clydeside (2 - 6 per cent.), SouthWales and Monmouthshire (2-6 per cent.), Merseyside (2-4 per cent.) and lyneside(2-2 per cent.). On the other hand, some places, such as Leicester, Derby,Huddersfield, Gloucester, Birmingham and district, Bradford and Coventry, haveunemployment rates of less than \ per cent.15. Complete information is not available about the additional labourdemands which the defence programme will make in the different Regions. certain information has, however, been given by the Ministry of Supply concerning theengineering industries which is understood to be complete for the air programme,though not for other sectors. This information is given by Regions in the Appendix,together with the current outstanding vacancies in the engineering industries. Itis given solely for the purpose of illustrating the relative distribution of the additional demands between Regions. If complete information were available it might modifysome of the details, but it is not considered that the broad picture disclosed in41312
the Appendix would be fundamentally changed. In order to measure the incidence of the additional demands they have been expressed as a percentage of the totalnumber of employees in the engineering industries in each Region, and as a percentage of the total number of employees in other manufacturing industries. Itwill be seen that the Regions where, on present information, the incidence of thedefence programme on the engineering industry will be heaviest are South-Western(18-4 per cent.), North-Western (14-1 per cent.), Southern (11-5 per cent.) and scotland (10 per cent.). For all other Regions the percentage increase is less than8 per cent. If we look at the defence demands in relation to the resources of labour employed in other manufacturing industry in the various Regions, it is clear thatthe same four Regions, together with Midlands, will need a higher proportionatediversion of labour than the others. The South-Western and Southern Regionsstand out with 15-7 and 14-1 per cent., Midlands follows with 8-4 per cent., andthe others are about 6 per cent.16. These facts emphasise&apos; three important points. First, that the workingof the production controls by which the various cuts in less essential industries and services will be put into effect must be flexible so that they can release more labourwhere it is urgently needed and less in areas where the labour might be fritteredaway, or indeed unemployed. The second point is that even where this is done tothe maximum extent compatible with reasonable administration it will still leaveunsolved the labour supply problems of certain areas of particularly heavy demand.Third, even with the measures proposed in the second part of this Paper we muststill expect a considerable wastage of those released for defence and export work,a tendency which will be emphasised by the natural practice of employers inreleasing first elderly workers and those who are least productive.17.   To summarise, therefore:  (a) we are faced with an additional demand of between 500,000 and 600,000workers for defence. His Majesty&apos;s Forces and essential industries and services, and this at a time when the general pressure of demand for labour is very high;(b) we must hope towards the end of the period for some decrease in thenumbers unemployed when the re-deployment of labour is complete and we may hope for some increase in the total working population which may range between 200,000-300,000;(c) there should also be some easement in the competitive demand from less essential manufacture when raw material shortages begin to take effect and if public feeling is aroused, some increase in voluntary movement from less essential employment to defence, export and other essentialproduction.(d) the incidence of the demand falls unevenly between different parts of thecountry and thus intensifies the difficulty of ensuring that all theresources of labour available can be concentrated to meet the essentialdemands;(e) no mere arithmetical closing of the gap will solve the labour supplyproblem.18. I set out below the steps which I have already taken, and propose totake, to encourage labour to enter and remain in defence and export production,to discourage their entering inessential industries and services and to ensure the efficient utilisation by employers of their labour.III. Measures already taken19. During the-last months I have discussed on different occasions with theN.J.A.C. the steps which both sides of industry might take to assist in the effectivedeployment of labour for carrying out the Rearmament Programme. A numberof proposals were agreed and have been sent by the Council to its constituentmembers, and I have written to certain N.J.I.Cs. asking them to give these recommendations careful consideration.  Of these the most important are:  (a) the practicability of some extension of overtime working as a means ofincreasing production;(b) the part-time employment and training of women on semi-skilled processes;(c) the development of schemes of upgrading and training to offset the scarcity of skilled workers.
In suitable cases, it was further suggested/that the training which industry could provide itself might be supplemented in Government Training Centres (G.T.C.)on the lines which proved successful in the last war.20. The response of industry to these recommendations has been encouraging.In many firms satisfactory schemes of upgrading and training have been introduced and, in accordance with an agreement with the engineering industry at national level, local arrangements have been made in Scotland and the Eastern Region foradmitting able-bodied workers to classes in Government Training Centres pro-viding training in some of the scarcity skilled occupations. In other Regionsnegotiations are continuing and I hope that before long some 1,400 engineeringtraining places will have been taken up at G.T.Cs.21. Suitable arrangements have also been made for dealing with labourredundancies when they arise. Employers have been asked to give Local offices of the Ministry timely notice of the number and type of workers that they anticipatethey will shortly no longer require, and workers who are about to be dischargedhave been encouraged to register with Local Offices before they actually becomeunemployed. These arrangements are designed to assist workers to pass from onejob to another without an intervening period of unemployment.22. As work on the Defence Programme builds up to its peak the scarcity of labour of the right type is going to be increasingly felt. To meet this problem the steps so far taken, including schemes for upgrading and training, are by them-selves inadequate.   More drastic measures are now required.IV. Future arrangements23. I feel sure that the only effective way of making available the workersrequired, not only for the Defence Programme but also for export and essentialcivilian production, is the cutting down of less essential civilian production.Further, whatever production controls it may be decided to use for this purpose will, as stated above, have to be applied on a differential basis to ensure that labour is released in areas where it is wanted and to prevent workers from beingdischarged where suitable alternative employment is not available. On theassumption that such production controls will be introduced, there are ways inwhich my Department can assist.24. Labour Supply Inspection. I am proposing to revive, on a limited scale,a system of labour supply inspection on the lines of what was done during the war.The duties of these technical inspectors will be to visit selected firms and obtain information about the ways in which they are using their labour and, if vacanciesfor particular kinds of workers have been notified to Local Officers, to ascertainhow far these additional workers are really needed and the extent to which therequirements could be met by the firm from its own resources. They will examine whether skilled labour is being extravagantly used or engaged on unimportant workand whether under-employment exists. Employers might then be invited to considerthe recommendations made by the Inspectors and to take appropriate action tocarry them out.25. A system of Labour Supply Inspection will not, however, of itself, ensurethat employers do discharge the workers they do not require. If an employer isunco-operative, it will be necessary to bring pressure to bear upon him and I haveno doubt that the most effective instrument for this purpose would be to cut downhis supplies. If it were known that production controls would be used, if necessary,our hands would be greatly strengthened.26. Regulation of Engagement Order. During and after the war variousRestriction and Control of Engagement Orders made it illegal for an employer and a worker to enter upon an engagement for employment except with the per-mission of the Ministry of Labour. An employer, therefore, could only obtain hisworkers and workers could only obtain employment through an employment exchange. While penalties were imposed for non-compliance, the. main sanctionbehind the Order was the use of the power of direction.27. The only certain and fully effective method of ensuring that the labourreleased by cuts in production or otherwise goes where it is wanted would be by asimilar Control of Engagement Order coupled with the power of direction of
individuals. In present circumstances, however, the use of powers of direction is out of the question, but Regulation of Engagement Order without power of direction,and operated on the following lines, would go some distance towards solving theproblem.28. The Order would place an obligation upon an employer not to obtain hisworkers otherwise than through an Employment Exchange. In practice this would compel workers to obtain their jobs through an Exchange because otherwise an employer could not legally engage them. The only penalty would be that imposed on the employer. Power would be taken in the Order to exclude certain parts ofthe country, so that, if experience showed that the Order was not necessary in some areas, these areas could be excluded from its operation. Agriculture and coal-mining would be excluded, as would registered dock workers, merchant seamen andfishermen.29. The main object of the Order would be to make all workers seekingemployment come to the Employment Exchanges. This would enable the Exchangesto inform workers of the important vacancies and try to persuade them to take them. The Exchanges would thus be able to go a long way in preventing employers who are making an extravagant use of their labour from taking on additionalworkers and in ensuring that workers do not drift away into unimportant employ-ment. The Order would also reduce substantially the amount of poaching ofworkers by employers that is at present going on. Experience during the warshowed that an Order of this kind was the only effective method of achieving this.30. I would make it clear from the start that there is no intention of compelling. workers to accept employment which they were unwilling to take. When workerscame to Exchanges to seek employment, they would be told plainly what were themost important jobs suitable for them and urged in the national interest to agreeto be submitted to one or other of them. If he could not be persuaded to take oneof the jobs offered to him in defence or export production, he would then be permitted to take the employment for which he asked (except in the case where we felt a firmwas fully manned).31. This method of administering the Order would enable EmploymentExchanges to perform their proper functions and would encourage workers tothink of an Exchange as a place where they would be told and given good adviceabout suitable opportunities for employment while still remaining free to choosetheir jobs.32. I would therefore ask my colleagues to approve the opening of negotia-tions forthwith with the T.U.C. and the British Employers Confederation with aview to the introduction of a Regulation of Engagement Order on the lines set outin the preceding paragraphs. ^Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,5th October, 1951

It is not considered that laterfigures would have any appreciable effect on the percentages shown in columns (5) and (6).Notes on the Interpretation of the figures in assessing the significance of the percentages in columns (5) and (6), some regard must bepaid to the likely degree of error in the statistical information used in the calculation. The additional labour requirements given by the Ministry of Supply in C.P.C. (51) 50 are not comprehensive and donot include the additional labour required for Admiralty orders (which is not, however, expected by the Admiralty to amount to a significant total C.P.C. (51) 54). The percentages in columns (5)and (6) may be affected by the fact that the Ministry of Supply&apos;s figures cover different proportions of the different programmes, e.g., the aircraft programme is fully covered, but only 60 per cent, ofthe munitions supplies programme and 50 per cent, of the radio programme are covered. This mayintroduce some bias into the figures since the different programmes affect the Regions in differentdegrees, but it may not be appreciable. A further bias may have been introduced by spreading the70,000 additional workers required by sub-contractors and minor firms for the air programme (about36 per cent, of additional defence requirements) in the same ratio as the regional distribution of thelabour requirements of direct contractors for the manufacture of aircraft and components. It isunderstood that the figure of 70,000 includes an unknown number of workers who will be transferredto defence work within establishments as well as additional workers who will have to be recruited from outside. There is also probably some overlap between the figures in columns (2) and (3),which it is not possible to eliminate and which is not likely to affect the Regional distribution.Table showing by Regions the Estimated Increases required by March 1954, in Employmentin the Engineering Industries (S.I.C.
